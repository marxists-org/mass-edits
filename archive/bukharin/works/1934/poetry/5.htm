<H3>5. The Level of Poetic Work in the U.S.S.R. and the Tasks of Poetry</H3>

<P>In raising the question of the tasks which confront our poetry, we must begin with the problem 
of our epoch <BR>. We are now living at an altogether exceptional time. We, the 
U.S.S.R., are
the watch-tower of the whole world, the &quot;skeleton army&quot; of future mankind. This fact must be 
grasped, thought out, felt. Our vision extends over thousands of years. The great idea for 
which we
stand is penetrating to all ends of the globe. We are not living an existence on paper, in a 
manifesto, nor in the speculative dreamland of great minds and hearts. We are living as a real 
force - real if
there ever was one. Potentially, we are everything. We are the heirs of thousands of years, of 
all culture handed down from age to age. We are continuing the struggle of hundreds upon 
hundreds of
generations of fighters - those who have tried to throw off the yoke of exploitation once and for 
all. We are the glorious vanguard of the workers who are changing the world, a grim army which 
is
getting ready for fresh battles. We are the soul of historical reason, the main triumphant 
driving force of world history. On the topmost ranges of human will and action, we build and 
struggle, suffer
and triumph. Our tasks are ones of colossal magnitude. Our responsibility before history is 
unbelievably tremendous.</P>

<P>It is from this point of view above all that we must regard the level attained by our poetry. And when we regard it
from this angle, we see that we are exceedingly backward, that we are only making our first 
steps towards the creation of a new poetic culture in world history. The poetic material
now collected in the treasury of our poetry - is it not jejune, is it not squalid when compared 
with the colossal content of
our life? Do we succeed, even in the slightest degree, in depicting the catastrophic collapse
of the old culture in the
East and in the West? Is not the marvellous book of history closed with seven seals to our 
poets? Has our own history,
the history of late years, been comprehended in all its diversity' with its heroic working days 
and its workaday heroics, in the live dialectics of thousands upon thousands of the
most varied problems, tormenting experiences, joys of creation, collisions and solutions? Have 
our poets assimilated to
a sufficient degree the splendid heritage bequeathed us by the old masters of all times and 
peoples, the right to receive
which has been given them by the triumphant proletariat, whose sons they now are? No, and yet
again no! Crude, uncultured provincialism still prevails among us. Our poetry
has not yet risen to an understanding of the full significance of our era. It does not yet 
understand where it stands. It does
not yet see that &quot;Roof of the World,&quot; those &quot;Pamirs&quot; about which Bryussov wrote and which have 
now already been &quot;discovered.&quot;</P>

<P>The poet's business is not to paraphrase a newspaper
article or to show a standard knowledge of political science, in which the general level in our 
country has now become very high. What is needed is breadth and depth of knowledge; one must be 
able
to feel a thing through and through,
to bring it out to the light of day, to put it into form. But for this there is a lack of 
imagery and means of expression
generally. They are lacking, because the entire level of our poetic culture, when compared with 
the problems that face it, is terribly low, both in its content and its &quot;formal&quot; attributes. 
Which of our
poets has such a feeling for the era we
are living in that a great universal canvas opens before his mind's eye? Which of our poets 
really feels to the full the historic place which we hold in the living stream of modern 
history? There are no
such poets as yet. We have not yet reached that stage. We snatch at scattered fragments, in 
which the whole co-exists only in the form of declaration. Hardly any of us even face the 
problem in its
full scope. It would, of course, .be absurd to demand that these requirements be immediately 
and fully met. But that is not the point. The point is that we must systematically raise the 
level of poetic
self-knowledge. This means that the poet must study not only the facts of the past and of the
present but also the problem of expressing them in poetry.</P>

<P>There is also another question, closely connected with the above - namely, the question of synthetic poetry-making, of monumental poetic works. Our era now demands thisnow above all. If 
we trace
the evolution of our poetry, taking the type of poetic production as our criterion, it is not hard to distinguish three periods in this process of evolution.</P>

<P>The first period was a time of new slogans, the first flush of struggle, the promulgation of 
new principles of life to the workers of the world, the beginning of a new era. The poetry of
this period was
declarative, spacious in its ideas, verging on the cosmic. All this, however, without flesh and 
blood, resembling rather a poetical blueprint. Poetry consisted to a great extent of abstract heroics - in so
far as the word &quot;abstract&quot; can be applied to poetry at all.</P>

<P>The second period. Feverish activity. Construction. The time requires concrete knowledge and 
skill, the highest practical ability, attention to detail, the culture of the small which goes 
to make the
great, specialization. Poetry makes a right-about face towards portrayal of the minutiae of 
life.</P>

<P>&quot;To discover the world revolution in every detail&quot; - that was how Bezymensky put it. &quot;Cosmism,&quot; 
&quot;World Sovnarkoms&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup> etc., gave place to the minutiae of empiric description. Poetry entered the phase of 
dialectical negation of the previous period. Universalism passed into its opposite. The 
minutely concrete,
the part of the whole, analysis - such were now the dominant ideas.</P>

<P>The third period is that upon which we are entering at the present time. Our life has developed 
tremendously, grown infinitely more complex. The problems of mastering the technical side of 
our work
have not yet been solved, but much has already been done. Cultural requirements have grown to an extraordinary degree, interests have become immeasurably more diversified. There is a 
tremendous
thirst to know everything, a tremendous desire to generalize, to rise on a new basis to an 
understanding of the process as a whole. Hence the need for synthetic poetry and synthetic 
literature in
general. This period is the prelude to a phase in which poetry will summarize life, in which 
our epoch will be presented not in fragments of the whole, but, in so far as is possible, in 
all its connections
and settings. This is not a mere return to the starting point, not a reversion to declarative
schematic poetry, but a synthesis which can only arise on the basis of previous analytical work.</P>

<P>Needless to say, this division into periods must not be taken too literally. The features noted 
above do not by any means cover the whole content of each period - to assert this would be sheer
unreason, or denote an elementary ignorance of the facts. In particular, we are far from having 
exhausted all the problems of the concrete type. But however diverse maybe the types of poetic 
work,
certain dominant tendencies nevertheless stand out above the rest. And it is these tendencies we have in mind. Hence we must draw a second conclusion (the first was the necessity of raising 
poetic
consciousness to the level of our era and of doing away with
provincialism). And our second conclusion will be that, while continuing to employ the concrete 
and the individual as our subject-matter, we must proceed to the task of summarizing life in 
poetry; on
the basis of the concrete and individual, we must proceed to the portrayal of the universal, 
richly variegated and dissected whole.</P>

<P>Here we come up against a further problem, namely, that of the diversity and unity of poetic 
material.</P>

<P>Karl Marx once wrote in biting ridicule of bourgeois political economy that it is the most moral of sciences, that its ideal is &quot;an ascetic but usurious miser, and an ascetic but 
productive slave.&quot; &quot;Its
main dogma,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is selfabnegation, the renunciation of life and of all human wants. The 
less you eat, drink, buy books, the more seldom you attend the theatre; dances, the caf&eacute;, the 
less you
think, love, theorize, sing, paint, fish, etc., the more you save, the greater grows your 
fortune which neither moth nor rust can corrupt - your capital.&quot;</P>

<P>This apt characterization throws light on Marx's positive views. Marxian communism aims at an infinitely diversified development of human wants. Its aim is a full-blooded human being with
all-round
development, not a wretched onesided creature, emasculated in this respect or that. Loving, 
theorizing, painting, thinking, fishing - it was doubtless with intention that Marx placed such
incommensurable magnitudes side by side with one another - are not only no &quot;sin.&quot; They are all 
glorious functions of vitally active man, to whom labour itself becomes a &quot;prime necessity of 
life.&quot; This
is the goal to which we are advancing - overcoming tremendous difficulties on the way, battling 
every step, but advancing nevertheless. From this follows the quite definite conclusion: The 
entire
diversity of life can and should serve as the material for poetic creation. Unity does not mean 
that we must all sing the same song at the same time - now about sugar beets, now about the &quot;live 
man,&quot;
now about the class
struggle in the countryside, now about a Party membership card. Unity does not mean the 
presentation of the same ideal types and the same &quot;villains,&quot; nor the abolition - on paper - of all 
contradictions
and evils. Unity consists in a single <I>aspect</I> - that of building socialism. All the richness of 
life, all tragedies and conflicts, vacillations, defeats, struggle of conflicting 
tendencies - all this must become
the material for poetic creation.</P>

<P>The better we are able to show the diversity of this life, the more thoroughly we grasp these
fundamental historical arteries - and this will be achieved by the point of view, not by 
impoverishing the
content - the better and the higher will be the standing of our literature and our poetry.</P>

<P>It seems to me that precisely at the present time, when we are faced, let us say, with the 
problem of depicting types, it will be possible to take and depict isolated types as wellsay,
the isolated worker
of a Political Department, the isolated pilot of the Red Fleet, and so forth. This tendency is 
very rapidly gaining ground among us. But I consider that the pilot must be shown in such a way 
that he
forms a unit of this life. The Political Department worker must be shown as the focus of this life - in such a way that all the rays may radiate from this focus and, intersecting one another, 
show the
whole multiformity of our life. Then we shall obtain a multiform art.</P>

<P>If we do not do this, we shall be threatened with the danger of poetic work becoming 
departmentally alienated from life and bureaucratized, orders being issued by the People's 
Commissariat of
Education, by the People's Commissariat of Ways of Communication, by the Transport Workers' 
Trade Union, by the Wood-Working Industries Trade Union and so on.</P>

<P>This, of course, is not art at all. In any case there is a very grave danger of this kind of 
art ceasing to be art. It is not along these lines that the way forward lies.</P>

<P>I repeat once again: I do not deny that even this kind of portrayal may be possible, but this
is only a starting point. From here we should advance further. Through these figures we must 
show the
whole mighty flourishing of our onward moving socialist life. We must show all the vital 
wealth, all the conflicts, waverings, defeats, struggle of tendencies, not simply present an 
elementary
portrayal, resembling a beam to which a red flag is nailed. Down with the beam in the domain of 
poetry! We must show the whole struggle of tendencies, the whole multiformity of life.</P>

<P>But no man can &quot;embrace the unembraceable.&quot; People approach a problem from different angles 
until sufficiently broad generalizations are found. &quot;Prohibitive&quot; measures are therefore 
absurd. If, for
instance, the idea of &quot;portraying the live man&quot; was one-sided, it does not follow from this 
that, with the change of leadership on the &quot;critical front,&quot; this sort of portrayal should be 
relegated to the
scrap-heap and virtually prohibited.</P>

<P>And so we arrive at our third conclusion: All the diversity of our remarkable era, with all its 
contradictions, should serve as material for poetic creation. Unity should be achieved through 
the point of
view from which this material is handled by the poet, not by impoverishing the material itself. 
This point of view is that of the triumphant struggle of the proletariat.</P>

<P>And if that is so - as it unquestionably is - then the solution of the further problem is also 
clear, the problem of the unity and diversity of form. The general problem of form and content 
we have
already solved in the first part of our report, showing the correlation of form and content, 
their dialectic unity on the one hand and their dialectic contrariety on the other. At present 
we are dealing
with the unity and diversity of <I>form</I>. It is not hard to see that, if a diversity of poetic 
material is essential to us, then - by virtue of the interconnection between form and content - we 
must also have
diversity of poetic form. The rhythms of an elegy and a war-song cannot be the same, because 
the sound aspect of the image is at one and the same time the aspect of its emotional content. 
But if we
admit and consider desirable the greatest variety of poetic material, and consequently also the 
greatest variety of poetic form, what is then the unifying, &quot;morphological&quot; factor? Indeed, if 
there is a
unity of form and content, then unity of material (diverse unity) must have its counterpart in 
unity of form (diverse unity). The answer to this is that the unity of this diversity is 
achieved by unity of
style or unity of method.</P>

<P>We thus arrive at our fourth conclusion: The forms of poetic creation should be the most 
diverse, unified by the one great style or method of socialist realism.</P>

<P>But here we come to the problem of socialist realism itself - a problem which must be analysed 
separately and in somewhat greater detail.</P>

<P>First of all, we would consider, in this connection, the question of poetic method and of 
style. It seems to us that in this field, at any rate, the two coincide. Let us take some 
instances. In the field of
logical thought we have, for example, the positivism of August Comte; and this had its 
counterpart in art in the naturalism of Emile Zola. Comte's positivism is a method and, if you 
wish, a scientific-philosophical system at one and the same time. Zola's naturalism was an &aelig;sthetic 
interpretation, a translation into the language of art, of the scientific-philosophical methods 
of positivism. For art,
this was both a method (because in the very process of creative work it provided guiding and 
regulating ideas) and a style, because both in the content and in the form, and also in the 
whole, that is
in their unity, this method, materializing and taking literary shape in the completed work, 
became a &quot;morphological,&quot; constructive principle, shaping form and content. In the completed 
work (or works)
unity of method becomes unity of style. In so far as
the poet is guided by a definite method in his work, he selects his material accordingly 
(because he can never embrace the whole in the exact sense of the word, he always &quot;picks and 
chooses&quot;); he
selects images, words, sounds, rhythm, which blend into a single poetic whole - one thing 
involving another, in compliance with very intricate laws. Rut when the work is completed, its 
structural
principles become a &quot;congealed&quot; method, or, to express it otherwise, the method has found its 
other form of existence in the structure of this work. If, then, we have a number of works, 
united by
common structural principles, that is, a definite <I>trend</I> in art - in this case, in poetry - the <I>more 
common </I>(we underline: <I>more common</I>, that is, not all, by far) of these structural principles are 
typical for the
entire trend. And this is style in the proper sense of the word.</P>

<P>We have quoted Zola as an example. Another case in point is our own Russian symbolism. Its 
philosophical basis, that is, its general trend of thought, was a peculiar mystic idealism, a cross between
Kant and Vladimir Solovyev. Symbolism was the counterpart of this in poetry. Mystic idealism 
sought for a mystic other-worldly essence beyond the world of phenomena and beyond the world of
reality generally. Symbolism, as a method, was a translation of this regulative idea into terms 
of poetry. It meant that reality had to be turned into symbols of the beyond; this, in its 
turn, involved a
choice of images, visual or musical, a selection of components, logical and emotional, such as 
would conform to this methodological requirement. But no sooner had this work been done, no 
sooner
had a poetic trend arisen on this basis, than the method assumed a form, became a style. 
Symbolism arose as a literary phenomenon: the poetry of symbolism became a fact.</P>

<P>Let us now revert to the question of socialist realism. Its philosophical basis is dialectical 
materialism. From this point of view, socialist realism is a distinct method in art,
the counterpart of dialectical materialism, the translation of the latter into terms of art. 
(Parenthetically, let us note that it does not by any means follow from this that every good 
poet must first
become a good philosopher; the connection is more complex, but this is a separate question.) 
What does this mean? What is socialist realism and what are its peculiar features? In what 
respects does
it differ from realism generally?</P>

<P>Socialist realism cannot set out to solve the same problems as dialectical materialism in 
science - a fact which follows from the very essence of the difference between science and art. 
From the analysis
given in the opening part of this report, it is clear that in describing nature, for instance, 
socialist realism does not set out to think of it only in terms of electrons, light and heat 
waves, rays, etc., as
against sounds, colours and other directly sensory elements. In depicting society, it cannot 
set out to employ categories of value, basis and superstructure, and so forth. It employs 
sensory images
first and foremost, and even intellectual elements receive a definite emotional tinge. Without 
this, there is no art in general or poetry in particular. But realism generally and socialist realism in
particular, as a method, is the enemy of everything supernatural, mystic, all other-wordly 
idealism. This is its principal and definite attribute.</P>

<P>&quot;<I>Omnis determinatio est negatio</I>&quot; - &quot;All definition is negation,&quot; said old Spinoza. The negative 
definition of realism is that it is not idealism, not mysticism. But this negative definition is at the same
time its positive definition. This means that sensory reality and its motion, and not its 
fictitious sublimations, that real feelings and passions, real history, and not various 
versions of the &quot;world
spirit,&quot; provide the material which it portrays. In conformity with this, the elements of form 
will also be other than is the case, let us say, in symbolism. The combination of images, the
verbal scoring
will serve not to conjure up the supernatural but to
reproduce reality and the real motions of the feelings with the greatest possible vividness. It 
does not, however, follow from this that realism, from the point of view of form, precludes the 
employment
of metaphors, including personification. Everything that enhances the sensory effect can and 
does find a place in the poetic lexicon, because it is perceived as a metaphor. &quot;Terek's stream 
like a
lioness leaping&quot; does not contradict realism just as the reverse metaphor: &quot;He lay like a 
rock,&quot; with its transfer of a dead image to the living, does not contradict realism either.</P>

<P>What distinguishes socialist realism from realism in general? It is distinguished, first of 
all, by the artistic material it employs. We have on several occasions pointed out that unity of form and content
does not preclude their contrariety. As old Trediakovsky<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2)</a></sup> wrote: &quot;In Poetry generally, it 
behoves us to note two things. Firstly: the matter, or thing, which the Poet undertakes to 
write. Secondly:
versification, that is, the method of composing the Verses.&quot; Socialist realism is distinguished 
from other realism by the fact that it inevitably focuses attention on the portrayal of the 
building of
socialism, the struggle of the proletariat, of the new man, and all the manifold complexities
of &quot;connections and settings&quot; of the great historical process of our day. We must always bear 
in mind that
within poetic unity there co-exist intellectual, emotional and volitional elements, forming a single indivisible whole. Certain guiding and evaluating factors - the class token, the aim - form 
an element
which is present in every work, even if only in a very subtle and sublimated form. The point of 
view of the proletariat's victory is, of course, a constituent trait of all works of socialist 
realism; it gives
them their &quot;social meaning.&quot;</P>

<P>Is this distinction, however, the only one? Or are there
methodological, and consequently also stylistic, peculiarities of socialist realism, 
distinguishing it from bourgeois realism?</P>

<P>Of course there are such features.</P>

<P>These features are most intimately connected with the content of the material and with 
purposefulness of a volitional order, dictated by the class position of the proletariat. In the 
socialist society
which is coming into being, the difference between physical labour and brain work is gradually 
being effaced. A new type of man is arising in whom intellect and will are not cloven in two: he really
knows the world in order to change it. Mere contemplation, mere portrayal of the objective, 
without elucidation of the motive tendencies, without reference to the practical alteration of 
the objective
world, are here receding into the past. Hence, socialist realism cannot base its views on the
naturalism of Zola, who proposed to describe reality &quot;<I>telle, qu'elle est</I>&quot; (&quot;such as it is&quot;) and 
nothing more.
Neither can it accept his other slogan: &quot;<I>L'imagination n'a plus d'emploi</I>&quot; (&quot;imagination is no 
longer needed&quot;). Socialist realism dares to &quot;dream&quot; and should do so, basing itself on real 
trends of
development.</P>

<P>In connection with this, we must also consider the question of revolutionary romanticism. If 
socialist realism is distinguished by its active, operative character; if it does not give just 
a dry photograph
of a process; if it projects the entire world of passion and struggle into the future; if it 
raises the heroic principle to the throne of history - then revolutionary romanticism is a 
component part of it.
Romanticism has usually been contrasted to realism. This was because romanticism in the 
majority of cases has been connected with idealistic soarings into metaphysical dimensions and 
&quot;other
worlds,&quot; and its exalted emotion of the &quot;sublime and beautiful&quot; led beyond the confines of the 
objective world. This was also because realism expressed a narrow and contemplative so-called
&quot;objectivism.&quot; Narrow, because it did not
educe the tendencies leading to the future. Contemplative, because it limited itself to 
registering what exists, though not, of course, &quot;in its pure form.&quot; In our circumstances 
romanticism is connected
above all with heroic themes; its eyes are turned, not on the heaven of metaphysics, but on the 
earth, in all its senses - on triumph over the enemy and triumph over nature. On the other hand, 
socialist
realism does not merely register what exists, but, catching up the thread of development in the 
present, it leads it into the future, and leads it actively. Hence an antithesis between 
romanticism and
socialist realism is devoid of all meaning.</P>

<P>The old realism was to a certain extent anti-lyrical, while the old lyricism was - also to a 
certain extent - anti-realistic. Socialist realism is bound to have its eyes fixed on man. In the 
final analysis,
socialism means the genesis of new human qualities, the enrichment of spiritual content, the 
development of many-sidedness, the end of squalid misery among people torn asunder into classes,
narrow professions, city and country dwellers.</P>

<P>Here I must make one observation on a point which might perhaps have escaped the notice of the 
other comrades here. It relates to the letter from Andr&eacute; Gide which was read out at this 
congress. In
my opinion the wording employed by Andr&eacute; Gide is incorrect. He speaks of Communist 
individualism. To my mind, Communist individualism is a contradiction in terms, an &quot;oxymoron,&quot; 
a logical
solecism. But Gide's idea on the portrayal of personality is correct. He is confusing two 
concepts - the growth of personality with the growth of individualism, the growth of the 
individual with the
growth of individualism, the enrichment of the personality's content with the growth of that 
which divides one man from another. Individualism in its development has a tendency to divide people.
When, let us say, a decadent poet converses with a shoemaker, the shoemaker does not understand 
the poet, and the poet does not understand the shoemaker. This
is an expression of the deepest division of labour, of the individualism of capitalist society. 
We, on the other hand,
want to understand each other without any difficulty; at the same time we want each one of us
to be, not a blockhead or a eunuch, but a real good fellow who can do anything, who understands
everything, and who can develop still further, unfolding his inner consciousness to infinity. Here there are no boundaries, no barriers between the wealth of growing personalities and the
splendid
triumphal progress of the common collective wealth of communist society-economic, technical and 
cultural wealth.</P>

<P>The new man that is being born and the whole world of his emotions, including even &quot;new 
erotics,&quot; if one may so express it, are therefore the province of socialist art. Lyric verse 
does not conflict
with socialist realism, because we are not here speaking of an anti-realistic form of lyric, 
seeking for a &quot;world beyond,&quot; but of a lyric which gives poetic shape to the spiritual 
experiences of the
socialist man who is now coming into being. Socialist realism is not anti-lyrical.</P>

<P>Here we may touch upon yet another question, closely allied to this. Socialist realism is not anti-lyrical, but it is anti-individualistic. This does not mean that it fails to portray human 
personality and
that it does not develop it. Socialism, as is well known, means the flourishing of personality, 
the enrichment of its content, the growth of its selfknowledge as a personality. But the growth 
of
individuality is by no means equivalent to the growth of individualism, <I>i.e.</I>, of that which 
disunites people. On the contrary, the feeling of a collective bond between people is one of 
the principal traits
of socialism, and the poetized form of this feeling must inevitably be reflected in the 
distinguishing stylistic traits of socialist realism. Thus, socialist realism is 
antiindividualistic.</P>

<P>The type of poetic work which presents a period in its more general and universal attributes, embodying them in
peculiar images concretely abstract - images of extreme generality and at the same time of 
colossal inner richness - ran counter to the old conception of realism. Take Goethe's <I>Faust</I>, for 
example. This,
in its form, is not a portrayal of a concrete historical process, but the struggle of the human 
spirit. And at the same time <I>Faust</I> is a philosophic-poetical conception of the bourgeois era 
establishing
itself. An analogous type of poetry, of another calibre, can be seen, for instance, in 
Verhaeren's <I>Dawns</I>, in which he describes the &quot;symbolical&quot; city of &quot;Oppidomagne,&quot; where the 
socialist revolution
is taking place. It seems to us that poetry of the type of <I>Faust</I>, with a different content and 
consequently of a different form, but still maintaining the extreme generality of <I>Faust</I>, must 
unquestionably
find a place as a component part of socialist realism, and that it will create the most 
monumental form of socialism's poetry.</P>

<P>Such are the basic and distinguishing traits of socialist realism. And thus we come to our fifth conclusion, namely: Socialist realism is a method of poetic creation and a style of 
socialist poetry
depicting the real world and the world of human feelings, a style differing from bourgeois 
realism both in the content of the objects which poetry depicts, and in its distinguishing 
stylistic features.</P>

<P>We must now retrace our steps a little. We have seen above that the whole manifold diversity of 
our era should serve as material for poetic creation, unity being provided by the socialist 
point of
view. We have seen that the forms of poetic works may be the most varied, unity being attained 
by singleness of style. Hence we may conclude that this style forms a single inseparable whole 
with
the material. Such is the genesis of the poetry of socialist realism.</P>

<P>We have seen that the development of our poetry presupposes a much higher level of poetical 
culture generally. We must say outright: Our poetry is sometimes elementaryand this happens all 
too
often in the case of people whose
ideas are closest to ours. Incidentally, one of the distinguishing marks of a significant work 
is the wealth of associations and feelings, thoughts and innuendoes which it evokes. If you 
compare a
number of our poets' works with those of Verhaeren, for example, you will see how many 
thoughts, often even philosophical ones, how many problems, comparisons, images, how much 
culture the
tatter's work contains. Whereas we often accept a rhymed slogan as poetry. You may men. tion 
Mayakovsky. But time has set its stamp on him, too: because life has grown infinitely more 
complex,
and we have to keep moving forward. Culture, culture and yet again culture; It is time to put a 
stop once and for all to Bohemianism and the squabbles of literary cliques. Take the really 
great masters,
even those who &quot;do it with ease,&quot; like our great genius Pushkin, who, &quot;careless&quot; and 
&quot;light-minded&quot; as he was reputed to be, was nevertheless an erudite scholar and hard worker, 
occupying a
commanding position in the culture of his time. It is absurd to require all poets to be 
firstrate philosophers and critics. It is no accident that some men become philosophers and 
others poets.
Academician Pavlov's latest works explain the physiological side of this phenomenon. But this
does not mean that we must abandon our demand for a marked rise in the general culture of poets 
and
in poetical culture along the whole front. To stop at the present level is impossible. And 
those who really want to create &quot;Magnitostroys of literature,&quot; having purified their ideas in 
regard to art, must
do their best to make themselves masters of all the treasure-houses of the world's culture.</P>

<P>I wish to make one further observation. I have often had to listen to complaints, from 
poets, and from literary men in general, to the effect that someone or other will not let them 
y&quot;expand&quot; and so
forth. I think this quite absurd, because no One is at any time or under any circumstances 
preventing anyone from, let us say, learning languages, with which our ,poets are almost 
entirely
unacquainted; or from studying 
foreign literature or the literature of the national minorities inhabiting 
our country, with
which our poets again are almost entirely unacquainted; or from knowing our 
life, and not
only ours, but that of Western Europe too, as it should be known. And if we 
take as an
example such a man as Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin, every one of us knows 
that even at
the age of fourteen he displayed extraordinary erudition, knowledge of 
contemporary life both
in Russia and abroad. Whereas ours, comrades, could be put under a 
threepenny bit! We
must put a stop to this! I will therefore ask you, comrades, not to take 
offence at any hard
words that I speak to you here. Together let us not only fill ourselves 
with a sense of the
grandeur of this most mighty epoch in the history of mankind, but let us 
also draw the
conclusion for ourselves: we must advance towards a great literature, 
towards a tremendous
literature, towards a literature mighty in its content, towards a 
literature of action, towards a
liter. ature whose craftsmanship, too, will place it on the mountain peaks 
of greatness in the
history of mankind and in the history of art!</P>

<P>I conclude my report with the slogan: We must dare, comrades!</P>
