<!--section title-->


<P>It seems to me, comrades, that in considering the great problems of our Soviet poetry, we must have before us that picture of our life and that picture of world affairs which presents itself to our eyes at the present time. Our country now occupies a position of world-wide importance, a position of tremendous power. Our country is on the brink of mighty battles. Within the country, we have achieved enormous success, both in technical and economic respects and in the class struggle, thanks to that wise leadership which is embodied in our Central Committee with Comrade Stalin at its head. There has been a tremendous growth of culture in our country both extensive, in <I>breadth</I>, when vast sub-strata of new human beings are rising up to genuine cultural life, and an intensive growth of this culture in <I>depth</I>; - this is accompanied by an enrichment of all elements that go to make human working personality, which, contrary to all the slanders of our enemies, is much more highly differentiated at the present moment than it ever was before, and which is now entering the arena of world affairs as the embodiment of the hopes of all mankind, confronted by the great menace which capitalism is preparing for it.</P>

<P>This gives rise to a peculiar complication of those problems which we have to tackle on our literary front in general and on our poetic front in particular.</P>

<P>It is no accident that in our time, understood in the narrow sense of this word - I mean the period through which we are passing at present - the problem of quality on all fronts should have been stressed with extreme sharpness.</P>

<P>The problem of quality is the problem of diversity, of a multitude of different approaches to a question, of individualization, of attaining greater depth, etc. Such is the problem of quality in technique, the problem of quality in the sphere of economics, the problem of quality in the sphere of leadership, the problem of quality in the sphere of ideas.</P>

<P>And if we understand - as we all unquestionably dothat poetic creation is one of the forms of ideological creation, that poetic "production" is also a peculiar form of production, that poetry, no matter whether the poet thinks about this or not, is one of the most powerful factors in social development as a whole (we may note in passing that even the ancients, let us say the Greeks, perfectly well understood what some professional literary theorists of our time fail to understand - namely, the socially educative, the educationally militant role of all literature as a whole and of poetry in particular) - if, I say, we bear in mind this problem of quality, then for our poetic creation, too, the problem of quality, the problem of mastering the technique of poetic creation, the problem of craftsmanship, the problem of assimilating the heritage of past literature and culture is now being set in the forefront.</P>

<P>This is connected with those general problems which confront our country at the present time. While the capitalist world, stimulated by the growth of its contradictions, is pregnant with monstrous catastrophes, and all its social barometers point to storm and tempest, in our country the process of the maturing of the new, socialist man is going on at an almost fabulous speed, and all the problems involved in the building of socialism - including its cultural problems too - shoot up to new and much greater heights.</P>

<P>The worker of today is not the same as the worker of five or six years ago. The peasant of today, converted into a collective farmer, is already quite different in his mentality from the former peasant. That historical necessity which is leading us forward and onward, which is complicating, enriching, filling with fresh content the enormous human reservoir - those people who are now claiming their place on the historical arena with ever greater energy, with ever greater passion, with ever greater intelligence - these demand higher quality in all spheres and a more subtle approach to all kinds of literary production, poetry included.</P>

<P>The day is past when we could advance under the semiironical slogan of "A poor thing, but mine own." Today we must have the daring, the audacity to set genuine, universal standards for our art and poetic creation. We have to catch up and outstrip Europe and America in craftsmanship. This is what we must aspire to do.</P>

<P>Just because of this, the time has come for a general analysis in the field of literature, for summarizing experience, for defining orientations more exactly, for the statement of new problems commensurate with the great position held by the victorious proletariat in world history, and with the whole rhythm of this most interesting era in the life of mankind.</P>


<a name="main"></a><H3>1. Poetry
</H3>

<P>The final subject of this report is that of the problems of poetic creation in the U.S.S.R. But before proceeding to an analysis of these problems, it will be worth our while critically to examine a number of general questions connected with poetic creation - the more so since there is still a great deal that is not clear here, and this lack of clarity is reflected above all in our literary criticism, which has a great task to perform and does not always perform it well.</P>

<P>Here I must ask my hearers to excuse me. For a certain period of time they may find it rather boring, but boredom, like evil, will the better set off the good that will follow in the latter part of my report, where it will not be so boring, and where I shall, perhaps, encounter violent objections. Here I may invoke the authority of the blessed Augustine, who said that evil exists only in order to set off the good. Having cited such a powerful authority as this, let me ask you to have patience for a little.</P>

<P>Let us first consider poetry as such. The <I>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</I> says: &quot;Absolute poetry is the concrete and artistic expression of the human mind in emotional and rhythmical language.&quot;</P>

<P>It is easy to see that this definition suffers from the fundamental defect that it defines poetry, that is, a concrete form of art, by means of artistic activity, which itself must be defined from the point of view of the specific character of art. The definition is therefore tautological. Moreover, it is obviously necessary somehow to differentiate the special properties of poetic speech, of poetic language and of the corresponding poetic thought, because thought is firmly and indissolubly linked up with language. Ancient Hindu poetics had already developed the Anandavardhana doctrine (tenth century B.C.) of the twofold, &quot;hidden&quot; meaning of poetic speech. According to this doctrine, language in which words are used solely anal exclusively in their direct, &quot;customary&quot; sense cannot be called poetic speech. Whatever such speech may convey, it will .be prose. Only when the words, by various associations, evoke other &quot;pictures, images, feelings,&quot; when &quot;poetic thoughts glimmer, radiate, as it were, through the words of the poet, but are not expressed directly by him,&quot; do we have authentic poetry. Such is the doctrine of the &quot;<I>dhvana</I>,&quot; of the poetic innuendo, of the hidden meaning of poetic speech. Similar theories have often been associated with a mystic interpretation of poetry and poetic experience, as of something touching the fringe of &quot;other worlds.&quot; In ancient China we find, for example, a whole brilliant poetic treatise, the poem <I>Categories of Verse</I> by Ss&ucirc; - K'ung T'u (837 - 908 A.D.), on the theme of divine poetic inspiration, where the &quot;True Lord,&quot; the &quot;Prime Ancestor,&quot; the &quot;Creator of Transformations,&quot; the &quot;Spirit - like Transmogrifier,&quot; the &quot;Heavenly Loom,&quot; the &quot;Wondrous Mechanism,&quot; the &quot;Highest Harmony&quot; and, finally, the &quot;Black Nothing&quot; - the Great Tao - lives in a state of inexpressible poetic &quot;inspiration.&quot; Having their roots deep in the idea of the magic of the word, such ideas often led to the direct deification of the word, which became a mystic essence. Thus, we find in one Arab philosopher the interpretation of the &quot;Word&quot; with a capital W, the Greek Logos, not as reason raised to the degree of the world's Demiurge, but as the embodiment of volition creating the world. Yet strange as it may seem, it is a highly characteristic fact that this magical or semi-magical interpretation of the art of words and the art of poetry, after a long cycle of ages, has once more gained currency in our own era; it was comparatively recently that we had a similar interpretation of poetry in bourgeois literary theory and bourgeois poetics.</P>

<P>In our own times Gumilev<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup> has expressed this idea in poetic form:</P>

<P CLASS="quotec">In days of yore, when o'er a world still new<BR>
God leaned his head, it was a word<BR>
Which made the sun stop in his course,<BR>
And towns were ruined by a word.</P>

<P class="quotec">But we forgot the word alone is blessed<BR>
'Mid terrors that are sent us for a rod,<BR>
And in the Gospel that was writ by John<BR>
'Tis said the word - is God.</P>

<P>In his day Balmont,<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2)</a></sup> an unquestioned master of language, attempted to provide a &quot;theoretical&quot; basis for this fetishization of speech - reflexes in his book, <I>Poetry as Magic</I>, the very title of which clearly indicates the author's trend of ideas. &quot;The world needs the creation of images,&quot; he declared. &quot;The world has its magicians, who broaden and enrich the circle of existence by the magic of their will arid the music of their words.&quot; This poet, who was organically incapable of logical thinking, produces nothing to &quot;prove&quot; his argument but a long succession of carefully chosen and impressive images, which are intended to take the place of thought. Andrey Biely<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">3)</a></sup>, on the other hand, once made an attempt to give philosophic depth to the same subject, and word fetishism with him reached truly Himalayan heights. &quot;If there were no words, there would be no world,&quot; he wrote. &quot;My Ego, apart from its surroundings, does not exist at all. The world, apart from me, does not exist either. 'I' and 'the world' spring to life only in the process of their 
union in sound.&quot;</P>

<P>Thus, authors of various theories have lapsed into pure mysticism in their attempts to approach 
the problems of poetic speech. This, of course, had its causes - causes of a social and
historical nature which ate not far to seek. But at present this does not concern us. We only want to point out the <I>existence</I> of such a way of putting the question, and that at different
periods and in different countries.</P>

<P>Such points of view, inasmuch as they are idealistic and mystical, are of course unacceptable to us. They are a sort of refined barbarism, crudely contradictory to all scientific 
experience. But
their very existence emphasizes the problem of the specific character of poetic thought and 
poetic speech, of that &quot;mystery,&quot; &quot;sorcery,&quot; and &quot;magic,&quot; in which the mystics seek to envelop
their readers' minds as in a veil, locking all the doors of rational perception.</P>

<P>But there is nothing mystic in phenomena themselves. The process of life, taken as 
&quot;experience,&quot; has its intellectual, emotional and volitional sides. We make a conventional 
distinction
between logical thought, thought in terms of concepts, and &quot;thought in terms of images,&quot; the 
so-called &quot;realm of emotion.&quot; True, in actual life the stream of experience is integral and
undivided; nevertheless, in this very unity, we have the intellectual pole and the emotional 
pole, even though they may not exist in their &quot;pure form,&quot; even though they may merge into one
another. But it would be entirely and essentially wrong to make an absolute mechanical 
subdivision of the so-called &quot;spiritual life&quot; into water-tight compartments of feeling and 
intellect, or of
the conscious and the unconscious, or of the directly sensory and the logical. These are not 
separate domains of abstract categories. They are dialectical magnitudes composing a unity. At
one and the same time we are confronted with differences and even with opposites, though these 
opposites also merge into one another. This likewise gives rise to a certain difference in
types of thinking.</P>

<P>Logical thinking employs concepts, which range themselves into a whole ladder of thought, with 
various rungs, or degrees, of abstraction. Even when we are dealing with the highest type of
logical thought - dialectical logic - where the abstract concept includes its concrete attributes, 
the very concept, as such, causes sensory colours, sounds and tones to lose their vividness.
Moreover, perceptive action oversteps the bounds of the senses, although it has its source in
them; in summarizing human experience, it perceives, for instance,. the subjectivity of colour,
and coming closer to a real perception of the world, of its objective nature, independent of 
the subject, it &quot;replaces&quot; colour by a light wave of definite length. In science, the entire 
qualitative
diversity and multiformity of the world take on other forms, quite distinct from
immediate sensation, but giving a much more adequate reflection of reality - that is, more true.</P>

<P>On the other hand, the entire world of emotions - love, joy, terror, grief, rage, and so on to 
infinity - the entire world of desire and passion, not as the object of research, but as 
experience, as well
as the whole world of immediate sensations, also have their points of condensation - thought in 
terms of images. Here there is no abstraction from what is directly experienced. Here the
process of generalization does not take us beyond its limits (as is the case in logical thought 
and in its highest product, scientific thought). Here this very sensory experience - doubly 
concrete
and doubly &quot;alive&quot; - is itself condensed. Here we have, not a scientific reflection of real 
existence, but a sensorily generalized picture of a phenomenological series, not of the 
&quot;essence,&quot; but of
the &quot;phenomenon.&quot; This does not by any means signify that we are dealing with an illusion or a 
dream. Nothing of the sort! This essence appears in the phenomenon. The essence merges
into the phenomenon. The senses do not fence us off from the world.</P>

<P>But objective reality is here &quot;reflected&quot; differently. In science, it is reflected as a world 
of qualitatively diverse forms of matter; in art, as a world of sensory images; in science, as 
electrons,
atoms, species, value, etc.; in art, as colours, odours, hues, sounds, images. The type of 
thinking here is not the same as in logical thought. Here generalization is achieved not by
extinguishing the sensory, but by substituting one complex of sense symbols for a great 
multitude of other complexes. This &quot;substitute&quot; becomes a &quot;symbol,&quot; an &quot;image,&quot; a type, an
emotionally coloured unity, behind which and in the folds of whose garments thousand's of other 
sensory elements are concealed. Every such unity is sensorily concrete. To the extent that
such unities are selected and fixated, <I>i.e.</I>, that these experiences are constructively, 
creatively reproduced, to this extent we have art.</P>


<P>The word itself is a highly complex magnitude. Being the product of many thousands of years of 
development, it embraces, like some cell of a &quot;spiritual organism,&quot; all the problems of thought
with both its principles - image and concept. In scientific terminology, it grows as a symbol of 
the &quot;pure concept&quot;; in poetical speech; it is imagery first and foremost. Consequently, the laws
governing both the selection of words and their combination will differ, or, to express it 
otherwise, poetical speech will inevitably have its specific peculiarities. That remarkable 
investigator of
these problems, Potebnia<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">4)</a></sup>, who while essentially developing the theory of Humboldt<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">5)</a></sup>,&quot; arrived at 
a number of most original solutions, formulates the polarity of art and science as follows:</P>

<p class="quote">&quot;Alike in the .broad and in the strict sense, all that pertains to thought is subjective; that 
is to say that, even though conditioned by the external world, it is yet the product of personal
creation. But within this all-embracing subjectivity, we can distinguish the objective and the 
subjective, and refer science to the first ands art to the second. The basis for this is as 
follows: in
art, only the image is the common property of all; it Is understood differently by everyone, 
and' the understanding of it can consist only of unanalysed (real and wholly personal) feeling, 
such
as is evoked by the menage; in science, however, there is no image, and feeling cannot enter save as a subject of research; the sole building material of science is the concept, 
composed of
symbols of the image already objectivized in the word. If art is a process of objectivized 
primary data of spiritual life, then science is a process of objectivizing art. The difference 
in degree of
objectivity of thought ins identical with the difference in the degree of its
abstractness: the most abstract of sciences, mathematics, is at the same time the most 
unquestionable one in its principles, the one that least of all admits the possibility oaf 
personal views.</P>

<P>It is easy to see that these formulations contain a number of errors. The author does not 
present any clearly defined ideas on the truthfulness, the objectivity of perception, and a 
loophole is left open
for idealism; he obviously underestimates the social character of language, of the entire 
creative process, etc.; he draws too sharp a line of demarcation, metaphysically separating 
different aspects of
thought. In consequence there is little that is dialectic here. At the same time there is much 
that is true and unquestionably deserving of attention. To continue the broken thread of our 
argument, we
may say that the system of concepts proceeds outward through science: taking the sensations as 
our starting point, we advance further and further beyond their borders, where we perceive the
objective character of the world, continually studying new facts and perfecting science, moving 
along the endless path of converting relative truth into absolute truth, destroying antiquated 
systems
of science as we proceed on our way. In the field of art we do not go beyond the limits of the 
phenomenological series; here, as we said before, the objective world is reflected differently; 
here
emotions are not made the object of scientific research; here even nature is &quot;humanized.&quot; Here, 
therefore, the &quot;warm,&quot; emotional, vivid! and metaphorical principle is placed in relative 
contrast to the
&quot;cold,&quot; intellectual, logical principle:</P>

<P CLASS="quotec">Water and stone,<BR>
Verse and prose,<BR>
Ice and fire. (<I>Pushkin</I>.)</P>

<P>Poetry is understood both in the broad and in the narrow sense of the word. All speech in terms 
of images is poetical
speech; from this point of view Gogol's <I>Dead Souls</I> or Pushkin's <I>The Captain's Daughter</I> are 
poetical works. By poetry in the narrow sense is understood not simply the fixation of sensory 
images in
words, but, in addition, rhythmical speech and even rhymed speech. It must not be thought, 
however, that there are any hard and fast lines of demarcation. The rhymed, rhythmical rules of 
arithmetic in
India have only the sound image; they thus possess one element of poetry, but that does not 
make them poetry. The philosophical treatise of Lucretius, <I>De Rerum Natura </I>(<I>On the Nature of 
Things</I>),
presents not only sound images but many others besides, and is therefore poetry. Here too, 
then, one element merges into the other.</P>

<P>Poetic creation and its product - poetry - represent a definite form of social activity, and are 
governed in their development, regardless of the specific nature of poetic creation, by the 
laws of social
development. As we shall see later, when we go into this question in detail, the &quot;verbal&quot; 
character of poetic creation is no argument whatever against the sociological treatment of 
poetry. On the
contrary: only by a Marxian analysis of poetry can we understand it in its full scale, in all the totality of its attributes. True, the Marxists have paid but little attention to the 
specific problems of
language. But a deeper analysis of its phenomena inevitably leads to a sociological treatment
of the word itself. And indeed it could not 'be otherwise. Examine a word, and you discover the
palaeontology of language. Words are the depository of the whole previous life of mankind, 
which has passed through various social-economic structures, with diverse classes and groupings,
different spheres of experience, labour, social struggle, culture. That which Potebnia calls 
&quot;the heredity of words,&quot; and which can be developed into the evolution of language (or 
languages), is the
reflection of actual social-historical life. Within the microcosm of the word is embedded the 
macrocosm of history. The word, like
the concept, is abridged history, an &quot;abbreviature,&quot; or epitome, of social-historical life. It 
is a product of this life, not a Demiurge of history, not a Logos creating a world out of 
nothing.</P>

<P>We have seen how poetry, as the fixation of sensory images in words, summarizes the world of 
emotion in its own peculiar way. But these emotions, these experiences are in themselves 
experiences of
the social-historical man, and in a class society, of the class man. For even such emotions as 
have their roots in the fathomless biological depths of man, like emotions of an erotic nature, 
are modified
in the course of the historical process. Fixated, selected images therefore cannot but come 
within the spheres of sociological analysis; they are social phenomena, phenomena of social 
life. Finally,
thinking in terms of imagery is none the less thinking. The emotional element here merges with 
its opposite. On the other hand, a tremendous wealth of ideas, concepts, standards, ideologies, 
systems
of philosophy enters bodily into poetic unity as an inseparable part of it. Here the 
intellectual merges with the emotional, that is, with its opposite. The poetic image, as an 
integral unity, is therefore not
&quot;purely&quot; emotional; much less is the unified system of images purely emotional. Hence it 
follows that poetry, when considered from this angle, is a social product; it is one of the 
functions of a
concrete historical society, reflecting and expressing in a specific form the specific features 
of its time and - in so far as we are dealing with a class society - of its class.</P>

<P>It is highly ridiculous how certain bourgeois theoreticians, giving a re-hash of idealist, philosophical &aelig;sthetics or &aelig;sthetic philosophy, which has been represented by very great 
names, by such
giants of bourgeois thought as Kant, Schopenhauer and Hegel, keep reiterating surprisingly 
vapid and tedious arguments to the effect that art in general and poetry in particular have no 
relation at all
to practice, to &quot;interest,&quot;
to will. Kant, for example, in his <I>Kritik der Urteilskraft</I>, asserted this principle with all 
his force. Schopenhauer contrasts &quot;disinterested&quot; artistic contemplation to the ancillary 
character of science.<sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">6)</a></sup>
According to Hegel, &quot;the object of art should be contemplated in itself, in its independent 
objectivity, which, though existing for the subject, does so only in a theoretical, 
intellectual way, not
practically, and without any reference whatever to desire or will.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">7)</a></sup> All this is utter 
nonsense. Take the art of ancient Greece. The comedies of Aristophanes are political 
journalism, but at the same
time admirable works of art. There you will find the struggle of parties, definite political 
tendencies, ridicule of political opponents, etc. And the tragedians - Sophocles, &AElig;schylus 
Euripides?</P>

<P>Everyone will understand the significance of the poetic contests that were held there, when the 
poets were awarded crowns by the crowd. If we went a step further, and if the crowd in the Park 
of
Culture and Rest were to crown with laurels, let us say, Sasha Bezymensky, as the best popular 
bard, that would be something taken right out of the ancient Greek world.</P>

<P>The objective, and also active, significance of the social function of poetry - if we are to give 
it a more general formulation - is to assimilate and transmit experience and to educate 
character, to reproduce
definite ;group psychologies. This peculiarly perceptive, peculiarly educative and peculiarly effectual function of poetry is truly tremendous, and at times it turns into that of an 
extraordinarily active
militant force.</P>

<P>Here we must emphasize once again that the subjective experience even of a &quot;purely scientific&quot; 
worker may be just as completely disinterested, in the sense of its remoteness
from all practice, as that of the creative artist; that &quot;contemplation&quot; of the astronomical map 
may, subjectively, be void of any element of self-interest or practicality. But objectively, in 
the total social
relation, <I>i.e.</I>, when regarded as a social function, both science and art in general and poetry 
in particular play, as has been pointed out, a tremendously vital and at the same time a 
practical role.</P>

<P>The cosmogonies of ancient India, the <I>Gilgamesh Epic</I>
of Babylon, the Greek <I>Iliad</I> and <I>Odyssey</I>, the Chinese fables,
Vergil's <I>&AElig;neid</I> the works of the great Greek tragedians, the
<I>Song of Roland</I>, the Russian folk-tales, etc. - were they not all
mighty levers of a peculiar social pedagogy, forming people
in accordance with their own commandments and canons?
The ancient cosmogonies were veritable poetical encyclop&aelig;dias. Homer was a fundamental subject 
of so-called
&quot;school&quot; tuition. In Rome the verses of Vergil were crammed
and scanned by no means as an empty pastime. The society
of those times and its social leaders were thereby reproducing
themselves in the realm of ideas, in an idealized form, inculcating their ideas, thoughts, conceptions, feelings, characters, ambitions, ideals, virtues. Even the Aristotelian <I>catharsis</I> (purging of the emotions) is a method of peculiar
moral and intellectual hygiene (<I>cf</I>. Lessing's arguments in
his <I>Hamburgische Dramaturgie</I> regarding the ultimate moral
aim of tragedy). Horace knew what he was doing when he
wrote that the aim of poetry was to mingle the useful with
the pleasant &quot;<I>miscere utile dulci</I>.&quot; The well-known Arab
philosopher, Averrhoes, spoke of tragedy as the &quot;art of
praising&quot; and comedy as the &quot;art of censure.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">8)</a></sup> Contrary to
idealist philosophy, Chernyshevsky,<sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">9)</a></sup> in his famous <I>Dissertation</I>, upheld the principle: &quot;What is of general interest
in life forms the content of art,&quot; and this somewhat crude formula is nevertheless infinitely 
closer to reality than are the pale shades of &quot;disinterested&quot; idealistic definitions, whose 
metaphysics carry us
away into the almost airless void of an a-social &quot;stratosphere.&quot;</P>

<P>The fact that words play a tremendous part in poetic creation, that the specific character of poetry is thought in terms of images, does not in any way run counter to a sociological 
treatment of poetry,
because even the word itself is the product of social development and represents a definite 
condensing point in which a whole series of social factors find their expression. And for this 
reason we
Marxists are faced with the task of subjecting this side of the matter, too, to a Marxist 
study, <I>viz</I>., the question of language, the question of words, the question of word creation, of 
the evolution of
language, etc.; and it seems to me that quite a considerable theoretical foundation for such a 
study has been laid in our Marxist and near-Marxist literature.</P>
