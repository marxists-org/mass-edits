<H3>2. Poetics as the Technology of Poetic Craftmanship</H3>

<P>Here again we shall have to settle some theoretical scores with the formalists, at the same 
time assigning them to the place they have merited among researchers in art theory, and also 
with those in the
sociological (including the Marxian) camp of literary theory who tend to over-simplify the 
question. We shall take our examples from comparatively early works written when the formalists 
were still
such in the genuine sense of the word. The formalists were - guided by considerations of the
following nature: Poetic language, i.e., in the final analysis, the word, is a constituent 
principle of poetry. It
is therefore necessary to elucidate the laws of poetic word combinations (from various angles). 
Since &quot;poetry is language in its aesthetic function,&quot; &quot;language
methods&quot; represent &quot;the sole hero&quot; in the science of literature.<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup> In other words: the specific 
nature of poetry requires the study of these methods, which constitute the only object of 
literary theory.
From this point of view the Marxian way of putting the question becomes sheer nonsense - an 
irrelevant intrusion of alien problems and utterly inadequate methods. The question has been 
much more
subtly dealt with by Zhirmunsky,<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2)</a></sup> but in the final analysis even he did not deviate very 
widely from his colleagues. &quot;Poetics,&quot; we read, &quot;is a science which studies poetry as an art. ...What is now
the subject of the most animated scientific interest is not the evolution of a philosophical 
view of life or of the 'feeling of life' in the great monuments of literature, not historical development, and the
changing of social psychology in its interaction with the individual psychology of the 
poetcreator, but the study of the poetic art-poetics, historical and theoretical.&quot;</P>

<P>The theoretical basis for this conclusion is provided by the author's argument regarding the 
real coalescence of so-called &quot;form&quot; and &quot;content&quot; in art. &quot;In actual fact, such a division of 
the <I>what</I> and
the <I>how</I> in art represents only a conventional abstraction. Love, grief, tragic struggles of the 
soul, philosophical ideas, etc., exist in poetry not by themselves, but in that concrete form in which they
have been expressed in the given work.&quot; &quot;All facts of 'content' also become phenomena of form.&quot; 
This is both true and not true. Not true, because the author sees only the unity, but does not 
see the
contrariety; he regards the entire complex only from the angle of formal logic, and not 
dialectically. This is the first point. Secondly - and this is much more important in the present 
case - the author's
reasoning is vicious at the
root. In reality, we are here dealing with a science whose duty is to understand poetry 
(historically and theoretically - we will not here discuss the question of the arbitrariness of 
this antithesis) <I>as an
art</I>. This vital ands original unity, which is developing and evolving, contains elements of 
&quot;love, grief...philosophical ideas.&quot; They are put into definite (poetic) form, but in their 
transformed aspect,
they have entered into the &quot;whole.&quot; How is this &quot;whole&quot; to be understood without touching on 
the genesis, origin, development, etc., of all these elements?</P>

<P>Evidently we must draw just the opposite conclusion to that arrived at by Zhirmunsky, namely, that since all the elements enumerated have entered into some synthetic whole - a work of 
art - then, in
order to understand this whole in all its aspects, we must go beyond its borders and reveal the 
sources of the entire morphological process. One cannot understand law without going beyond the
borders of legal formulae. One cannot understand religion without going beyond the borders of dogmatic theology. One cannot understand art without analysing its connections with the entire 
life-
activity of society, because art must not be transformed into a metaphysical &quot;thing - in - itself.&quot; 
Furthermore, as we have seen above, the very &quot;form&quot; of the word itself &quot;possesses content,&quot; and 
that not
only as the morphological factor in every new poetic work. It &quot;possesses content&quot; in another 
sense as well-namely, as the condenser of socialhistorical experience. The selection of 
metaphors in their
concrete form &quot;comes&quot; not as a result of the immanent logic of words: it is taken from the 
surroundings of life, just as is the <I>genre</I>, the style and a thousand other things.</P>

<P>The narrowness and one-sidedness of &quot;pure formalism&quot; compel Zhirmunsky to criticize, quite 
rightly, the theoretical structure of Eichenbaum's<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">3)</a></sup> arguments. However, he lapses
from his position and inevitably begins to contradict himself. In another work, analysing tile 
presence of &quot;extraneous elements&quot; in art, he concludes: &quot;All these examples raise the question 
of the limits
of historical (and, we may add, not only historical. - <I>N.B.</I>) poetics and the delimitation of its 
problems within the bounds of a broader science of literature.&quot; Very good. But in that case we 
are faced with
the following conclusion: either this &quot;broader science&quot; deals with art - in which case the whole 
fundamental structure of the author's argument collapses; or it is a science whose object is 
much broader
than art - in which case the author's argument regarding the coalescence of the so-called form 
with the so-called content falls to the ground, that is, the author's conception collapses at 
the other end.</P>

<P>Finally, Zhirmunsky makes a desperate attempt of a dualistic nature. He subdivides art into two 
sorts: 1) &quot;pure, formal, objectless arts, like ornaments, music, dancing,&quot; where &quot;the very 
material of
which they are built is conventional to the core, abstract, æsthetic, not burdened (!! - <I>N.B.</I>) 
with meaning, material significance, practical tasks,&quot; and 2) arts &quot;with an object or theme,&quot; 
&quot;like painting,
sculpture, poetry, theatrical art,&quot; &quot;burdened with meaning&quot; where &quot;the material of art is not 
especially æsthetic . . . .&quot; This attempt, however, is doubly fatal to the author. It is fatal 
because such a
subdivision simply does not fit the facts. The ornament is an image of things, people, plants and animals, symbolized to a very high degree, or else it is directly and intimately connected 
with &quot;practical
life&quot; in another way (<I>e.g.</I>, pictures on clay vessels). Music, as such, is by no means 
&quot;objectless&quot; - it is enough to mention Beethoven, Wagner, church music; there is even such a 
thing as philosophical
music-Scriabine, for instance. The dance possesses a very great vital significance (and even a 
purely practical one) - war dances, erotic dances, etc. Secondly, this attempt is fatal to the 
author because
it derisively contradicts his
ideas, for this time he quite inequitably tears away a number of elements from the æsthetic 
whole on the grounds that they are &quot;burdensome&quot; and unartistic.</P>

We have selected Zhirmunsky because he is one of the subtlest art critics of the formalist or &quot;near-formalist&quot; camp. His spiritual confrère beyond our borders, Professor O. Walzel, 
flounders in the toils
of approximately the same contradictions in his search for &quot;synthetic literary research&quot; 
(<I>synthetische Literaturforschung</I>).<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">4)</a></sup>

<P>The foregoing analysis gives us the clue to the positive solution of the problem. An integral science of literature must include the elucidation of the laws of literature as a whole, as an 
active function
in the life of society, as a &quot;superstructure&quot; of a peculiar kind, and this should include the 
laws, conditionally speaking, of the &quot;formal elements&quot; as well.</P>

<P>As a sub-species of such a literary science, as a conditionally specialized branch, we may have 
also a science of these formal elements, which must likewise have its sociological basis. Allthis does not
preclude the possibility of special researches within limited and perhaps even narrower bounds. 
Hence valuable results can also be derived, for example, from work done to elucidate the 
special laws
governing the technique of verse construction, or work devoted exclusively to the problem of 
imagery, or to the problems of sound in its relation to the image, etc., etc. These would all be special
&quot;branches,&quot; furnishing material for an integral science of literature. The tendency, therefore, 
which can frequently be observed in our own Marxian ranksnamely, a purely nihilistic attitude
to the
problem of form as such - is entirely wrong. In such an event literary research resolves itself 
into nothing but a superficial social-class characterization of the so-called ideological content of the poetic
work, which, in its bare, rudimentary and over-simplified form, is carried over into the 
characterization of the poet as a poet. As we have seen above, however, form and content 
constitute a unity, but a
unity of contradictions. Moreover, such an attitude leads people to understand by &quot;content&quot; 
what is, properly speaking, the ideological source of the content, and not its artistic 
transformation.
Needless to say, this leads to quite incorrect conclusions.</P>

<P>It should be clearly and distinctly understood: that there is a tremendous difference between formalism in art, which must be emphatically rejected, formalism in literary criticism, which
is equally
unacceptable, and the analysis of the formal elements in art (which is not formalism at all) - an 
analysis which is exceedingly useful and which at the present time, when we have to &quot;master 
technique&quot; in
all fields, is absolutely indispensable.</P>

<P>Formalism in art denotes the self-emasculation of the art in question, the utter impoverishment 
of its component parts - a phenomenon connected with the extreme contraction of the circle upon 
which
such <I>soi-disant</I> art exercises its influence. It is individualism bordering on solipsism, where 
sound almost ceases to be a form possessing any &quot;content.&quot;</P>

<P>In poetry we have such a phenomenon in the shape of &quot;irrational language.&quot; When one reads:</P>

<P class="quotec">Lulla, lolla, lalla - goo,<BR>
Leeza,, lolla, lulla - lee,<BR>
Pines, shoo - yat, shoo - yat.<BR>
Gee - ee, Gee - ee - oo - oo -</P>

<P>then the purely sound content (the musical melody of the verse) is in direct contrast to 
individual &quot;human&quot; words. The word ceases to be a word, because it is devoid of all meaning. All the living wealth of poetry disappears. Shklovsky<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">5)</a></sup> concluded his article &quot;On Poetry and Irrational 
Language&quot; with the &quot;prophecy&quot; of Slowacki<sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">6)</a></sup> that: &quot;A time will come when only the sounds in 
poetry will
interest poets.&quot; This hope, expressed by one of the foremost theoreticians of formalism, fully 
explains why he has played such a negative role in regard to poetry as an art. When Paul 
Verlaine, that
brilliant master of verse, poet of the subtlest and most delicate moods, demanded &quot;<I>de la musique avant toute chose</I>&quot; (&quot;music before all else&quot;), he never even dreamed of adopting the 
language of &quot;Dyr
bull shirr - ubeshur&quot; <I>à la</I> Kruchenykh.<sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">7)</a></sup></P>

<P>The formalists have a peculiar logic of development. If the so-called &quot;content&quot; is to be 
considered as an &quot;extraneous element,&quot; if all &quot;meaning&quot; is nothing 'but a &quot;burdensome 
magnitude,&quot; if this
meaning &quot;blocks the road&quot; of æsthetic emotion, then, of course, poetry's main line of 
development can be expressed in the slogan: &quot;Down with Faust and long live 'Dyr bull shirr'! &quot; 
Thus, the
theoretical &quot;emancipation&quot; from &quot;meaning&quot; leads in practice to &quot;irrationality.&quot; It must be 
borne in mind that we are not here speaking of &quot;wordbuilding&quot; and that our standpoint is by no 
means that of
the notorious Admiral Shishkov.<sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">8)</a></sup> What we are discussing is a tendency to do away with the 
word as such, to destroy all concepts, to debase imagery - in other words, to annihilate poetry 
as a
verbal art. The dialectics of formalism develop as follows: they begin their &quot;Gospel according 
to St. John&quot; by promulgating the thesis: &quot;In the beginning was the
word,&quot; and define the essence of poetry by the word and the word alone - only to end by doing 
away with that word altogether, and thus demolishing their central principal. The extreme 
individualism
of these arguments is also indicative of their social roots. They have their origin in abject
fear of the flood of new &quot;content&quot; accompanying the revolution, which overturned the tea-tables 
in so many
drawing-rooms, in the going into hermitage of &quot;proud&quot; bourgeois-intellectual &quot;individuals,&quot; who 
want to creep away into the burrow of the professional anchorite (&quot;And we, the poets wise&quot;...).</P>

<P>It is interesting to trace the evolution of formalism in art as the evolution of decadence in bourgeois art. I have already had occasion to show once in print how in the epoch of universal 
decadence in
which all bourgeois humanity is now living, the latter casts away the element of content from
all art, <I>i.e.</I>, in the last resort, destroys art itself.</P>

<P>So it was with painting, when bourgeois artists, continually impoverishing the elements of 
&quot;content,&quot; brought painting to the verge of a &quot;pure,&quot; &quot;decorative spot&quot;; all that remains is 
the &quot;spot&quot; as a
principle, and further progress is barred. The same thing happened in sculpture, through 
expressionism, when nothing was left but a curved lineand that was all. In architecture they 
began to be afraid
of superfluous &quot;content,&quot; reduced themselves to absolutely simple geometrical forms, and here 
too ended up in a blind alley.</P>

<P>The impoverishment of the elements of content brings its nemesis in the suicide of the given 
form of art. When the decadence of art reaches its last limits, there begins a process of 
frenzied casting
around in different directions, and this will continue until the other half of mankind - the 
proletariat, the toiling population - succeeds in creating a synthetic art, which will gather together all the riches of
human society and will create masterpieces of integral humanity; and this will have nothing in 
common with either
physical or spiritual eunuchs, but will regard them with contempt and abhorrence.</P>

<P>Formalism in literary theory, as we have seen, is closely linked up with formalism in art 
itself. Its most glaring error is that it attempts, on principle, to tear art from its vital 
social context. It creates the
illusion, or the fiction, of an entirely independent &quot;series&quot; of phenomena in art. The specific 
nature of art it confuses with its complete autonomy. As for the laws of art's development, it 
sees them only
in the immanent laws of its morphology, quite avoid of any connection with the most important morphological problems of social life in general. This dry, vapid, lifeless conception must 
emphatically
be rejected.</P>

<P>All this must not be confused with the task of analysing the formal elements in art. The 
latter, as we have seen above, is necessary and useful in the highest degree. The formalists 
considered this
partial work to be everything; they deduced general principles from this material. This is 
wrong and harmful. But an analysis of the formal elements in art, a profound study of all 
problems of the
structure of poetical speech, is an indispensable part of the broader field of work. And in 
this respect there is something to be learned even from the formalists, who investigated these 
problems, while
Marxist literary critics have regarded them with complete disdain.</P>

<P>This question acquires a special importance and actuality just now, when the problem of the 
cultural heritage in general and the problem of mastering the technique of art in particular 
have been raised
anew and in a serious light. But before discussing this question, it is first necessary to say 
a few words about the general problem, viz., to answer the question of how, in general, it is possible to learn
from the &quot;old masters,&quot; the &quot;classics,&quot; the &quot;predecessors,&quot; etc.</P>

<P>This question is by no means an idle one, and clarity here will obviate many mistakes. The 
essence of the whole
matter can be briefly summarized as follows: Every poetical work is an integral unity, in which 
sound, ideas, imagery, etc., are component parts synthetically united. On the other hand, it is 
also a unity
from the sociological viewpoint, since all the component parts and their synthesis, taken 
together, are &quot;ideological reflexes&quot; of a definite period and a definite class. How, then, 
under such
circumstances, is it possible to learn? :Should we not, on the contrary, utterly reject all 
previous &quot;contents,&quot; &quot;forms,&quot; &quot;methods,&quot; etc.? As is well known, such conclusions have actually 
been drawn,
although their absurdity is self-evident. The general answer to this question has been given by 
materialist dialectics, according to which &quot;negation&quot; is not sheer destruction, but a new phase 
in which
&quot;the old&quot; exists in <I>aufgehobener Form</I>,<sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">9)</a></sup> to use Hegel's terminology. In such a type of 
&quot;movement&quot; we have the possibility of a succession which will dialectically combine both a 
rupture with the old
and a peculiar continuation of it. A number of elements, when carried over into another 
combination, into another context, begin to live a new life, and thus a new &quot;unity&quot; is 
obtained. The reason for
this is that a unity is not a monolithic magnitude, but contains inner contradictions. We may
observe similar things in the field of material life: when we import a new machine, we 
introduce it into a new
complex of technicaleconomic organization, and the &quot;meaning&quot; of the machine thereby becomes 
different. Approximately the same thing happens in the realm of ideas - <I>mutatis mutandis</I>, of 
course.</P>

<P>There is another and quite different side to this question. Is it possible to learn to be a 
poet at all?</P>

<P>A perfectly correct answer, as it seems to us, was given to this question by Valery Bryussov. &quot;Ability for artistic creation,&quot; he said, &quot;is an inborn gift, like beauty of face or a powerful 
voice; this ability
can and should be developed, but by no amount of effort or study can it be acquired. <I>Poetae nascuntur</I> (poets are barn).&quot; The development of poetic ability is achieved with difficulty. 
&quot;Truly great poets, endowed with a genius for creation, achieved technical mastery only by 
means of slow
probation and long, patient labour.&quot; We are thus brought face to face with the problem of 
poetics, as the technology of poetic creation. In other words: elucidation of the laws 
governing the so-called
formal elements can be presented in the form of definite standards. Poetics then appears not 
only as a part of the theory of literature but, when transposed to another logical key, 
acquires the
significance of a system of rules. What we have in mind is not, of course, a school-book 
exposition of the subject, although even this is useful with a view to raising the general 
level of poetic culture,
but a conscious understanding of the full importance of <I>this</I> factor too. Without a study of the 
technology of poetic creation, one cannot learn the specific &quot;craftsmanship,&quot; &quot;the poet's 
trade,&quot; as
Bryussov expresses it, not very accurately, in his <I>Experiments</I>. Of course - and this seems to us 
axiomatic, - the &quot;studies&quot; cannot and should not on any account be limited to this &quot;technology.&quot; 
Even
that part of the studies which relates to the problem of the &quot;cultural heritage&quot; cannot be 
confined within such limits. For the wider our horizons are in all directions, the more 
fruitful will be the process
of making this heritage our own. Nevertheless a solution of this most elementary problem is 
quite indispensable, and this must be stressed with especial force, because the problem in 
question
somehow or other has not and does not come within the range of vision of our poets and - which is 
also extremely important - of our duly impanelled critics. Problems of rhythm and metre, problems 
of
verbal scoring, of stanza construction, etc. - all these must enter into the sphere of careful 
study, and the poet really must not resemble that character in Dmitryev<sup class="anote"><a href="#10" name="10b">10)</a></sup> who</P>

<p class="quotec">&quot;Forgets his lack of knowledge when he passes into raptures.&quot;</p>

<P>Such, in our opinion, is the problem of poetics, as the technology of poetic creation.</P>

<P>It seems to me that our most serious attention must now be turned to this side of the matter. And this applies to criticism, too.</P>

<P>At the present time one of the main tasks of criticism is not only to give an exact 
social-economic and social-political equivalent for the various poets, poetic tendencies, etc., 
but also to analyse these
carefully from the viewpoint of the specific character of poetic creation, from the viewpoint of language, imagery, stanza construction, verbal scoring, etc.</P>

<P>Without such an analysis, literary criticism at the present time is not of full value. In the 
days when we were vanquishing bourgeois society, our criticism was a battering ram which 
smashed the
enemy. We picked out the main thing, the sharpest point, <I>viz</I>., the social-political factor, and 
this, in our hands, was a shaft which we shot against the bourgeois antagonist.</P>

<P>But when we ourselves are building, when we need to learn craftsmanship, when we know that a 
definite number of poets have already taken their stand on a definite political platform, when 
we know
perfectly well that, ideologically, they are already close to us (of course, there will be 
backsliders, and we must be ruthless towards all enemies, nor must we relax our vigilance for
an instant) - this, of
course, is not everything. We must at the same time raise the problem of craftsmanship as never 
before, and criticism, in analysing the objects of its critical attention, must lay this very important and
essential side of the matter under the microscope.</P>

<P>Such criticism, unfortunately, has not as yet grown up among us in its full stature. But this is one of the tasks confronting us at the present time on the literary front.</P>
