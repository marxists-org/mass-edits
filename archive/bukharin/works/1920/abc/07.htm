    <H4><A NAME="055"></A>§ 55. The oppression of subject nationalities</H4>
    
    <P>One of the forms of the oppression of man by man is the oppression of
      subject nationalities. Among the barriers by which human beings are
      separated, we have, in addition to the barriers of class, those of
      national disunity, of national enmity and hatred.</P>
    
    <P>National enmity and ill-feeling are among the means by which the
      proletariat is stupefied and by which its class consciousness is dulled.
      The bourgeoisie knows how to cultivate these sentiments skilfully in order
      to promote its own interests. </P>
    
    <P>Let us consider how class-conscious proletarians should approach the
      problem of nationality, and how they can best solve it so as to further
      the speedy victory of communism.</P>
    
    <P>A nation or a people is the name given to a group of persons who are
      united by the use of a common tongue and who inhabit a definite area.
      There are additional characteristics of nationality, but these two are the
      most important and the most fundamental.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P>A few examples will help us to understand what is meant by the
      oppression of a subject nationality. The tsarist government persecuted the
      Jews, forbade them to live in certain parts of Russia, refused to admit
      them into the State service, restricted their entry into the schools,
      organized anti-Jewish pogroms, etc. The tsarist government, moreover,
      would not allow the Ukrainians to have their children taught the Ukrainian
      language in the schools. The issue of newspapers in the Ukrainian tongue
      was forbidden. None of the subject nationalities in Russia were even
      permitted to decide whether they wished to form part of the Russian State
      or not.</P>
    
    <P>The German government closed the Polish schools. The Austrian government
      prohibited the use of the Czech language and forcibly imposed German upon
      the Czechs. The British bourgeoisie regards the indigens of Africa and
      Asia with contempt; it subjugates the backward semi-savage peoples,
      plunders them, and shoots them down when they attempt to deliver
      themselves from the British yoke.</P>
    
    <P>In a word, when in any State the people of one nation possess all rights
      and the people of another nation possess only a part of these rights; when
      one nation, the weaker nation, has been forcibly united to a stronger
      nation; when the stronger nation has against the will of the weaker nation
      imposed upon the latter a foreign tongue, foreign customs, etc.; when the
      people of the weaker nation are not allowed to lead their own lives then
      we have what is termed oppression of a subject nationality, we have
      national enslavement.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="056"></A>§ 56. The unity of the proletariat</H4>
    
    <P>First of all, however, we must propound and decide an extremely
      important and fundamental problem. Should the Russian worker and the
      Russian peasant look upon the Germans, the French, the British, the Jews,
      the Chinese, or the Tartars, as enemies, irrespective of the class to
      which these belong? Are the Russian workers and peasants entitled to hate
      or to regard with suspicion those who belong to another nation, for the
      sole reason that these latter speak a different tongue, that their skins
      are black or yellow, that they have different customs and laws? Obviously,
      this would be quite wrong. The German workers, the French workers, the
      Negro workers, are just as much proletarians as the Russians are. No
      matter what tongue the workers of other lands may speak, the essential
      feature of their condition lies in this, that they are all exploited by
      capital, that they are all comrades, that they all alike suffer from
      poverty, oppression, and injustice.</P>
    
    <P>Is the Russian worker to love the Russian capitalist because his fellow-
      countryman abuses him in the familiar Russian terms, because his employer
      cuffs him with a Russian fist, or lashes him with a Russian whip? Of
      course not. Nor is the German workman likely to love the German capitalist
      any better because the latter taunts him in the German language and after
      the German fashion. The workers of all lands are brothers of one class,
      and they are the enemies of the capitalists of all lands.</P>
    
    <P>The same considerations apply in the case of the poor peasants of every
      nation. To the Russian peasant (the poor peasant or the middle peasant),
      the semi-proletarian peasant of Hungary, or the poor peasant of Sicily or
      Belgium, is nearer and dearer than can possibly be the rich peasant of his
      own land who exploits him, or the skinflint landlord who happens to be
      born on Russian soil and to speak the Russian tongue.</P>
    
    <P>But the workers of the whole world must not merely recognize themselves
      to be brothers by class, to be brothers in oppression and slavery. It
      would do no good if they were to rest content with railing against their
      capitalist compatriots in their respective tongues; if in each land the
      sufferers were to wipe one another's tears, and only within their own
      State were to carry on the struggle against the enemy. Brothers in
      oppression and slavery must be brothers in one world-wide league for the
      struggle with the capitalists. Forgetting all the national differences
      that tend to hinder union, they must unite in one great army to carry on a
      joint war against capitalism. Only by closing their ranks in such an
      international alliance, can they hope to conquer world capitalism. This is
      why, more than seventy years ago, the founders of communism, Marx and
      Engels, in their famous Communist Manifesto, fulminated the splendid
      slogan: 'Proletarians of all lands, unite!'</P>
    
    <P>It is essential that the working class should overcome all national
      prejudices and national enmities. This is requisite, not only for the
      world-wide attack upon capital and for the complete overthrow of the
      capitalist system, but also for the organization of a single world-wide
      economic system. Soviet Russia cannot exist without Donetz coal, Baku
      mineral oil, Turkestan cotton; but it is just as true that Central and
      Western Europe cannot do without Russian wood, hemp, flax, and platinum,
      or without American wheat; it is just as true that Italy finds British
      coal a vital necessity, and that Britain urgently needs Egyptian cotton,
      etc., etc. The bourgeoisie has found itself unable to organize a world
      economy, and the bourgeois system has been shipwrecked upon this
      difficulty. The proletariat is alone competent to organize such a system
      with success. To this end, however, it must proclaim the watchword, 'All
      the world and all the wealth that it contains belong to the whole world of
      labour.' This watchword implies that the German workers must completely
      renounce their national wealth, the British theirs, and so on. If national
      prejudice and national greed oppose the internationalization of industry
      and agriculture, away with them, wherever they may show themselves and
      under whatever colours they may sail!</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="057"></A>§ 57. The causes of national enmity</H4>
    
    <P>But it does not suffice that the communists should declare war on the
      oppression of nationalities and upon national prejudices, that they should
      advocate international unity in the struggle against capitalism, and that
      they should desire to found a world-wide economic alliance of the
      victorious proletariat. We must seek a far quicker way towards the
      overthrow of all jingoism and national egoism, of national stupidity and
      pride, of mutual mistrust among the workers of the various nations. This
      legacy from a brutal period of human life and from the brutal nationalist
      quarrel of the feudal and capitalist epochs, still hangs like a heavy
      burden round the neck of the world proletariat.</P>
    
    <P>National enmities are of very ancient date. There was a time when the
      different tribes were not content with fighting one another for lands and
      forests, but when the men of one tribe would actually eat those of
      another. Remnants of this brutal mistrust and enmity between nation and
      nation, between race and race, continue to exist between the workers and
      peasants of all lands. These vestiges of intertribal enmity are gradually
      dying out; in proportion as world commerce develops, as economic contact
      ensues, as migrations and minglings bring people of various stocks into
      close association on the same territory; but especially do they die out
      owing to the universality of the class struggle of the workers of all
      lands. Yet these vestiges of intertribal enmity do not merely fail to
      become extinct, but actually glow with renewed life, when to the old
      causes of national ill-feeling there is superadded an antagonism of class
      interests or the appearance of such antagonism.</P>
    
    <P>The bourgeoisie in each country exploits and oppresses the proletariat
      of its own land. But it does its utmost to convince its own proletariat
      that the latter's enemies are not to be found among bourgeois
      fellow-countrymen, but among the peoples of other lands. The German
      bourgeoisie cries to the German workers, 'Down with the French! Down with
      the English!' The British bourgeoisie cries to the British workers, 'Down
      with the Germans!' The bourgeoisies of all countries, especially of late,
      join in the cry, 'Down with the Jews!' The aim of this is to switch off
      the class struggle of the workers against their capitalist oppressors,
      into a struggle between nationalities.</P>
    
    <P>The bourgeoisie, however, in its desire to divert the workers' minds
      from the struggle for socialism, is not content with inflaming national
      hatred. It endeavours in addition to give the workers a material interest
      in the oppression of other peoples. During the recent war, when the
      bourgeois were chanting the German national anthem 'Germany, Germany above
      all', the bourgeois economists of Germany tried to convince the German
      workers that the latter stood to gain a great deal from the victory, stood
      to gain from the oppression and plunder of the workers of the conquered
      lands. Before the war the bourgeoisie made a practice of bribing the
      leaders of the working class with the lure of the profits derivable from
      colonial plunder and from the oppression of backward and weakly
      nationalities. The workers of the more advanced European lands, acting on
      the instigation of the most highly paid members of the working class,
      acceded to the proposals of the capitalists, and allowed themselves to be
      talked over by the jingo socialists into accepting the belief that they
      too would have a fatherland if only they would acquiesce in the plunder of
      the colonies and of the partially dependent nations. The worker who, under
      capitalism, proclaims himself a patriot, is selling for a copper or two
      his real fatherland, which is socialism; and thereby he becomes one of the
      oppressors of the backward and weak nations.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="058"></A>§ 58. The equal rights of the nations and the
    right to self-determination; federation</H4>
    
    <P>The Communist Party, declaring a relentless war upon all oppression of
      man by man, takes a decisive stand against that oppression of subject
      nationalities which is indispensable to the existence of the bourgeois
      system. Even more relentlessly do communists resist the slightest
      participation in this oppression on the part of the working class. It does
      not suffice, however, that the proletariat of a great and strong country
      should re pudiate all attempts at the oppression of the other peoples
      which the bourgeoisie or the aristocracy of its own land has crushed. It
      is also essential that the proletarians of oppressed nations should not
      feel any mistrust of their comrades who belong to the lands of the
      oppressors. When the Czechs were oppressed by the German bourgeoisie of
      Austria, the Czech workers looked upon all Germans as their oppressors.
      Our tsarist government oppressed the Poles, and the population of Poland
      has con tinued to cherish mistrust of all Russians; not merely of the
      Russian tsar, the Russian landlord, and the Russian capitalist. If we are
      to eradicate the mistrust felt by the workers of op pressed nations for
      the workers of oppressor nations, we must not merely proclaim national
      equality, but must realize it in practice. This equality must find
      expression in the granting of equal rights in the matter of language,
      education, religion, etc. Nor is this all. The proletariat must be ready
      to grant complete national self- determination, must be ready, that is, to
      concede to the workers who form the majority in any nation the full right
      to decide the question whether that nation is to be completely integrated
      with the other, or is to be federated with it, or is to be entirely
      separated from it.</P>
    
    <P>Is it possible, the reader will ask, that the communists can advocate
      the severance of the nations? How then will come into existence that
      unified proletarian world-embracing State which the communists aspire to
      found? There seems to be a contradiction here.</P>
    
    <P>There is no contradiction, however. In order to secure as speedily as
      possible the full union of all the workers of the world, it is sometimes
      necessary to countenance the temporary separation of one nation from
      another.</P>
    
    <P>Let us consider the circumstances in which such a course may be
      requisite. We will suppose that in Bavaria, which now forms part of
      Germany, a Soviet republic has been declared, while at Berlin the
      bourgeois dictatorship of Noske and Scheidemann still prevails. Is it
      right for the Bavarian communists, in that case, to strive for the
      independence of Bavaria? Certainly! And not only the Bavarian communists,
      but also the communists of other parts of Germany, must welcome the
      separation of Soviet Bavaria, for this will not be a separation from the
      German proletariat, but will be a deliverance from the yoke of the German
      bourgeoisie.</P>
    
    <P>Here is the obverse example. A Soviet republic has been proclaimed
      throughout Germany, Bavaria alone excepted. The Bavarian bourgeoisie
      desires separation from Soviet Germany, but the Bavarian proletariat
      desires union. What should the communists do? It is obvious that the
      communists of Germany should help the Bavarian workers, and should offer
      armed resistance to the separatist endeavours of the Bavarian bourgeoisie.
      This would not be the oppression of Bavaria, but the oppression of the
      Bavarian bourgeoisie.</P>
    
    <P>Again, the Soviet Power has been proclaimed both in England and in
      Ireland, both in the land of the oppressors and in the land of the
      oppressed. Furthermore, the Irish workers will not trust the English
      workers, who belong to a country which has oppressed Ireland for
      centuries. From the economic point of view, the separation will be
      harmful. What course should the English communists pursue in these
      circumstances? Whatever happens, they must not use force, as the English
      bourgeoisie has done, to maintain the union with Ireland. They must grant
      the Irish absolute freedom to separate. Why must they do this?</P>
    
    <P>First of all, because it is necessary to convince the Irish workers that
      the oppression of Ireland has been the work of the English bourgeoisie and
      not of the English proletariat. The English workers have to win the Irish
      workers' confidence.</P>
    
    <P>Secondly, because the Irish workers will have to learn by experience
      that it is disadvantageous for them to form a small independent State.
      They will have to learn by experience that production in Ireland cannot be
      properly organized unless Ireland is in close political and economic union
      with proletarian England and other proletarian lands.</P>
    
    <P>Finally, take the case of a nation with a bourgeois government which
      wishes to separate from a nation with a proletarian I regime, and let us
      suppose that, in the nation which desires to separate, the majority of the
      workers or a notable proportion of them are in favour of the separation.
      We may suppose that the workers of the separating country are distrustful,
      not only of the capitalists, but also of the workers belonging to the
      country whose bourgeoisie has oppressed them in the past. Even in this
      case it would be better to allow the proletariat of the separating land to
      come to terms in its own way with its own bourgeoisie, for otherwise the
      latter would retain the power of saying: ' It is not I who oppress you,
      but the people of such and such a country.' The working class will
      speedily realize that the bourgeoisie has desired independence that it may
      independently flay its own proletariat. The workers will speedily realize,
      moreover, that the proletariat of the neighbouring Soviet State desires
      the union, not for the sake of exploiting or oppressing the workers of the
      smaller land, but that all the workers may join in a common struggle for
      deliverance from exploitation and oppression.</P>
    
    <P>Although, therefore, communists are, as a general principle, opposed to
      the severance of one nation from another, especially when the lands in
      question have close economic ties, they can nevertheless countenance
      temporary separations. They will act as a mother acts when she allows her
      child to burn its fingers once that it may dread the fire evermore.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="059"></A>§ 59. Who expresses the &quot;Will of the
    Nation&quot;?</H4>
    
    <P>The Communist Party recognizes that the nations have the right to self-
      determination even up to the point of secession; but it considers that the
      working majority of the nation and not the bourgeoisie embodies the will
      of the nation. It would, therefore, be more accurate to say that when we
      speak of recognizing the right of the nations to self-determination, we
      are referring to the right of the working majority in any nation. As far
      as the bourgeoisie is concerned, inasmuch as during the period of civil
      war and proletarian dictatorship we deprive it of civic freedoms, we
      deprive it also of the right to any voice in the question of national
      affairs.</P>
    
    <P>What have we to say concerning the right of self-determination and the
      right of secession in the case of nations at a comparatively low or
      extremely low level of cultural development? What is to happen to nations
      which not only have no proletariat, but have not even a bourgeoisie, or if
      they have it, have it only in an immature form? Consider, for example, the
      Tunguses, the Kalmucks, or the Buryats, who inhabit Russian territory.
      What is to be done if these nations demand complete separation from the
      great civilized nations? Still more, what is to be done if they wish to
      secede from nations which have realized socialism? Surely to permit such
      secessions would be to strengthen barbarism at the expense of
      civilization?</P>
    
    <P>We are of opinion that when socialism has been realized in the more
      advanced countries of the world, the backward and semi-savage peoples will
      be perfectly willing to join-the general alliance of the peoples. The
      imperialist bourgeoisie which has seized its colonial possessions and has
      annexed them by force has good reason to fear the secession of the
      colonies. The proletariat, having no desire to plunder the colonies, can
      procure from them by the exchange of goods such raw materials as are
      required, and can leave to the natives of backward lands the right to
      arrange their own internal affairs as they please. The Communist Party,
      therefore, wishing to put an end for ever to all forms of national
      oppression and national inequality, voices the demand for the national
      right of self- determination.</P>
    
    <P>The proletariat of all lands will avail itself of this right, first of
      all in order to destroy nationalism, and secondly in order to form a
      voluntary federative league.</P>
    
    <P>When this federative league proves incompetent to establish a world-
      wide economic system, and when the great majority has been convinced of
      its inadequacy by actual experience, the time will have come for the
      creation of one world-wide socialist republic.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">If we examine the manner in which the bourgeoisie
      propounded and solved the problem of nationality (or, as mostly happened,
      complicated the issue), we see that in the days of its youth the
      capitalist class dealt with questions of nationality in one fashion, and
      that in the days of its old age and decay it is dealing with them quite
      differently.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">When the bourgeoisie was an oppressed class, when the
      aristocracy headed by a king or a tsar held the reins of power, when kings
      and tsars gave away whole peoples as their daughters' dowries, then the
      bourgeoisie was not merely accustomed to say fine things about the freedom
      of the nations, but actually attempted to realize such freedoms in
      practice - or at least the bourgeoisie of each nation did so as far as its
      own case was concerned. For example, when Italy was ruled by the Austrian
      crown, the Italian bourgeoisie headed the movement for national
      independence, endeavouring to secure the deliverance of Italy from the
      foreign yoke and its union to form a single state. When Germany was split
      up into a large number of petty princedoms and was crushed beneath the
      heel of Napoleon, the German bourgeoisie endeavoured to promote the union
      of Germany into a single great State, and it fought for the deliverance of
      the country from the French enslavers. When France, having overthrown the
      autocracy of Louis XVI, was attacked by the monarchical States of the rest
      of Europe, the revolutionary French bourgeoisie led the defence of the
      country and composed the national anthem known as the Marseillaise. In a
      word, the bourgeoisie of the oppressed nations always took the van in the
      struggle for deliverance; it created a rich national literature; it
      produced numerous men of genius painters, prose writers, poets, and
      philosophers. This is what happened in earlier days, when the bourgeoisie
      was an oppressed class.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Why did the bourgeoisie of oppressed nations strive on
      behalf of national freedom? If we are to listen to bourgeois poets, if we
      are to heed the works of bourgeois artists, the motive which animated the
      bourgeoisie was its hatred of all national oppression, its longing for the
      freeing and self-determination of every national stock, however small. In
      truth, when the bourgeoisie in any country fought for the deliverance of
      that country from a foreign yoke, it was fighting for the establishment of
      its own bourgeois State; for the power of fleecing the people of its own
      land without any competition on the part of other exploiters; for the
      right to the whole of the surplus value created by the town and country
      workers of their own land.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The history of all capitalist countries bears witness
      to this truth. When the bourgeoisie is oppressed in conjunction with the
      working people of its own nation, it clamours for the freedom of the
      nations in general, and insists upon the wrongfulness of any kind of
      national enslavement. But as soon as the capitalist class has secured
      power and has expelled the foreign conquerors be these aristocrats or
      bourgeois - it does its utmost to subjugate any weak nationality whose
      subjugation may seem profitable. The revolutionary French bourgeoisie, as
      represented by Danton, Robespierre, and the other noted figures of the
      first epoch of the revolution, appealed to all the people of the world on
      behalf of deliverance from every form of tyranny; the Marseillaise,
      written by Rouget de l'Isle, and sung by the armies of the revolution, is
      dear to the hearts of all oppressed peoples. But this same French
      bourgeoisie, having entered the second .phase of its revolution under the
      régime of Napoleon, subjugated the peoples of Spain, Italy,
      Germany, and Austria, to the strains of the aforesaid Marseillaise, and
      continued to plunder them throughout the Napoleonic wars. When the German
      bourgeoisie was subject to oppression, such writers as Schiller with his
      Wilhelm Tell voiced the struggle of the peoples against foreign tyrants.
      But this same German bourgeoisie under the leadership of Bismarck and
      Moltke forcibly annexed the French provinces of AlsaceLorraine, seized
      Schleswig from the Danes, tyrannized over the Poles of Posen, etc. The
      Italian bourgeoisie, having delivered itself from the yoke of the Austrian
      aristocracy, was perfectly ready to shoot down the conquered Bedouins of
      Tripoli, the Albanians and the Dalmatians on the shores of the Adriatic,
      and the Turks in Anatolia.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Why did these things happen, and why do they happen now? Why has the
      bourgeoisie invariably voiced the demand for national freedom, and why has
      it never been able to realize such freedom in actual fact?</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The explanation is that every bourgeois State which has
      freed itself from the yoke of another nation inevitably strives to extend
      its own dominion. In any capitalist country you please to select, you will
      find that the bourgeoisie is not content with the exploitation of its own
      proletariat. The capitalists need raw materials from all the ends of the
      earth. They therefore strive to acquire colonies, whence, after
      subjugating the natives, they can without hindrance procure the raw
      materials they need for their factories. They require markets for the sale
      of their wares, and they endeavour to find such markets in backward lands,
      being quite unconcerned as to how this may affect the general population
      or the still immature bourgeoisies of such countries. They need
      territories to which they can export surplus capital, so that they may
      extract profits from these distant workers, and they enslave such
      territories, disposing of them as freely as they do of their own land. If
      during the conquest of colonies and during the economic enslavement of
      backward lands, another powerful bourgeoisie is encountered as a
      competitor, the dispute is settled by war, and this tends to take the form
      of such a world war as the one which has just been finished in Europe. The
      great war did not end the enslavement of the colonies and of the backward
      lands; if any change has taken place for these, it has only been a change
      of masters. Furthermore, as the outcome of the war, Germany, Austria, and
      Bulgaria, which were free countries, have been enslaved. In this manner it
      has come to pass that the development of the bourgeois system, far from
      leading to a reduction in the number of the countries which are enslaved
      by other countries and by the bourgeoisies of these, has led to a positive
      increase in the number of enslaved lands. The bourgeois dominion has
      culminated in universal national oppression, for the whole world is now
      enslaved by the victorious group of capitalist States.</FONT></P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="060"></A>§ 60. Antisemitism and the proletariat</H4>
    
    <P>One of the worst forms of national enmity is antisemitism, that is to
      say, racial hostility towards the Jews, who belong to the Semitic stock
      (of which the Arabs form another great branch). The tsarist autocracy
      raised the hunt against the Jews in the hope of averting the workers' and
      peasants' revolution. 'You are poor because the Jews fleece you,' said the
      members of the Black Hundreds; and they endeavoured to direct the
      discontent of the oppressed workers and peasants away from the landlords
      and the bourgeoisie, and to turn it against the whole Jewish nation. Among
      the Jews, as among other nationalities, there are different classes. It is
      only the bourgeois strata of the Jewish race which exploit the people, and
      these bourgeois strata plunder in common with the capitalists of other
      nationalities. In the outlying regions of tsarist Russia, where the Jews
      were allowed to reside, the Jewish workers and artisans lived in terrible
      poverty and degradation, so that their condition was even worse than that
      of the ordinary workers in other parts of Russia.</P>
    
    <P>The Russian bourgeoisie raised the hunt against the Jews, not only in
      the hope of diverting the anger of the exploited workers, but also in the
      hope of freeing themselves from competitors in commerce and industry.</P>
    
    <P>Of late years, anti-Jewish feeling has increased among the bourgeois
      classes of nearly all countries. The bourgeoisie in other countries
      besides Russia can take example from Nicholas II in the attempt to inflame
      anti-Jewish feeling, not only in order to get rid of rival exploiters, but
      also in order to break the force of the revolutionary movement. Until
      recently, very little was heard of antisemitism in Germany, Great Britain,
      and the United States. Today, even British ministers of State sometimes
      deliver antisemitic orations. This is an infallible sign that the
      bourgeois system in the west is on the eve of a collapse, and that the
      bourgeoisie is endeavouring to ward off the workers' revolution by
      throwing Rothschilds and Mendelssohns to the workers as sops. In Russia,
      antisemitism was in abeyance during the March revolution, but the movement
      regained strength as the civil war between the bourgeoisie and the
      proletariat grew fiercer; and the attacks on the Jews became more and more
      bitter in proportion as the attempts of the bourgeoisie to recapture power
      proved fruitless.</P>
    
    <P>All these considerations combine to prove that antisemitism is one of
      the forms of resistance to socialism. It is disastrous that any worker or
      peasant should in this matter allow himself to be led astray by the
      enemies of his class.</P>

      Long ago, the Jews inhabited a definite territory and possessed a common
      speech; today they have no territory, and many of them do not understand
      Hebrew. The gypsies have their own language, but they do not inhabit any
      definite territory. The non-nomadic Tunguses in Siberia have a territory,
      but they have forgotten their distinctive tongue.</P>
