    <H4>§ 19 Characteristics of the communist system. Production unde
    communism</H4>
    
    <P>We have seen why the destruction of the capitalist system was
      inevitable. It is now perishing under our very eyes. It is perishing
      because it is affected by two fundamental contradictions: on the one hand,
      anarchy of production, leading to competition, crises, and wars; on the
      other hand, the class character of society, owing to which one part of
      society inevitably finds itself in mortal enmity with the other part
      (class war). Capitalist society is like a badly constructed machine, in
      which one part is continually interfering with the movements of another
      (see <A HREF="01.htm#013">§13</A> 'Fundamental contradictions of the
      capitalist system'). That is why it was inevitable that this machine would
      break down sooner or later.</P>
    
    <P>It is evident that the new society must be much more solidly constructed
      than capitalism. As soon as the fundamental contradictions of capitalism
      have destroyed the capitalist system, upon the ruins of that system there
      must arise a new society which will be free from the contradictions of the
      old. That is to say, the communist method of production must present the
      following characteristics: In the first place it must be an organized
      society; it must be free from anarchy of production, from competition
      between individual entrepreneurs, from wars and crises. In the second
      place it must be a <I>classless </I>society, not a society in which the
      two halves are at eternal enmity one with the other; it must not be a
      society in which one class exploits the other. Now a society in which
      there are no classes, and in which production is organized, can only be a
      society of comrades, a <I>communist society based upon labour</I>.</P>
    
    <P>Let us examine this society more closely.</P>
    
    <P>The basis of communist society must be the social ownership of the means
      of production and exchange. Machinery, locomotives, steamships, factory
      buildings, warehouses, grain elevators, mines, telegraphs and telephones,
      the land, sheep, horses, and cattle, must all be at the disposal of
      society. All these means of production must be under the control of
      society as a whole, and not as at present under the control of individual
      capitalists or capitalist combines. What do we mean by 'society as a
      whole'? We mean that ownership and control is not the privilege of a class
      but of all the persons who make up society. In these circumstances society
      will be transformed into a huge working organization for cooperative
      production. There will then be neither disintegration of production nor
      anarchy of production. In such a social order, production will be
      organized. No longer will one enterprise compete with another; the
      factories, workshops, mines, and other productive institutions will all be
      subdivisions, as it were, of one vast people's workshop, which will
      embrace the entire national economy of production. It is obvious that so
      comprehensive an organization presupposes a general plan of production. If
      all the factories and workshops together with the whole of agricultural
      production are combined to form an immense cooperative enterprise, it is
      obvious that everything must be precisely calculated. We must know in
      advance how much labour to assign to the various branches of industry;
      what products are required and how much of each it is necessary to
      produce; how and where machines must be provided. These and similar
      details must be thought out beforehand, with approximate accuracy at
      least; and the work must be guided in conformity with our calculations.
      This is how the organization of communist production will be effected.
      Without a general plan, without a general directive system, and without
      careful calculation and book-keeping, there can be no organization. But in
      the communist social order, there is such a plan.</P>
    
    <P>Mere organization does not, however, suffice. The essence of the matter
      lies in this, that the organization shall be a cooperative organization of
      <I>all</I> the members of society. The communist system, in addition to
      affecting organization, is further distinguished by the fact that <I>it
      puts an end to exploitation, that it abolishes the division of society
      into classes</I>. We might conceive the organization of production as
      being effected in the following manner: a small group of capitalists, a
      capitalist combine, controls everything; production has been organized, so
      that capitalist no longer competes with capitalist; conjointly they
      extract surplus value from the workers, who have been practically reduced
      to slavery. Here we have organization, but we also have the exploitation
      of one class by another. Here there is a joint ownership of the means of
      production, but it is joint ownership by one class, an exploiting class.
      This is something very different from communism, although it is
      characterized by the organization of production. Such an organization of
      society would have removed only one of the fundamental contradictions, the
      anarchy of production. But it would have strengthened the other
      fundamental contradication of capitalism, the division of society into two
      warring halves; the class war would be intensified. Such a society would
      be organized along one line only; on another line, that of class
      structure, it would still be rent asunder. Communist society does not
      merely organize production; in addition, it frees people from oppression
      by others. It is organized throughout.</P>
    
    <P>The cooperative character of communist production is likewise displayed
      in every detail of organization. Under communism, for example, there will
      not be permanent managers of factories, nor will there be persons who do
      one and the same kind of work throughout their lives. Under capitalism, if
      a man is a bootmaker, he spends his whole life in making boots (the
      cobbler sticks to his last); if he is a pastrycook, he spends all his life
      baking cakes; if he is the manager of a factory, he spends his days in
      issuing orders and in administrative work; if he is a mere labourer, his
      whole life is spent in obeying orders. Nothing of this sort happens in
      communist society. Under communism people receive a many-sided culture,
      and find themselves at home in various branches of production: today I
      work in an administrative capacity, 1 reckon up how many felt boots or how
      many French rolls must be produced in the following month; tomorrow I
      shall be working in a soapfactory, next month perhaps in a steam-laundry,
      and the month after in an electric power station. This will be possible
      when all the members of society have been suitably educated.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="020"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 20 Distribution in the communist system</H4>
    
    <P>The communist method of production presupposes in addition that
      production is not for the market, but for use. Under com munism, it is no
      longer the individual manufacturer or the individual peasant who produces;
      the work of production is effected by the gigantic cooperative as a whole.
      In consequence of this change, we no longer have <I>commodities</I>, but
      only <I>products</I>. These products are not exchanged one for another;
      they are neither bought nor sold. They are simply stored in the com munal
      warehouses, and are subsequently delivered to those who need them. In such
      conditions, money will no longer be re quired. 'How can that be?' some of
      you will ask. 'In that case one person will get too much and another too
      little. What sense is there in such a method of distribution?' The answer
      is as follows. At first, doubtless, and perhaps for twenty or thirty
      years, it will be necessary to have various regulations. Maybe certain
      products will only be supplied to those persons who have a special entry
      in their work-book or on their work-card. Subsequently, when communist
      society has been consolidated and fully developed, no such regulations
      will be needed. There will be an ample quantity of all products, our
      present wounds will long since have been healed, and everyone will be able
      to get just as much as he needs. 'But will not people find it to their
      interest to take more than they need?' Certainly not. Today, for example,
      no one thinks it worth while when he wants one seat in a tram, to take
      three tickets and keep two places empty. It will be just the same in the
      case of all products. A person will take from the communal storehouse
      precisely as much as he needs, no more. No one will have any interest in
      taking more than he wants in order to sell the surplus to others, since
      all these others can satisfy their needs whenever they please. Money will
      then have no value. Our meaning is that at the outset, in the first days
      of communist society, products will probably be distributed in accordance
      with the amount of work done by the applicant; at a later stage, however,
      they will simply be supplied according to the needs of the comrades.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It has often been contended that in the future society
      everyone will have the right to the full product of his labour. 'What you
      have made by your labour, that you will receive.' This is false. It would
      never be possible to realize it fully. Why not? For this reason, that if
      everyone were to receive the full product of his labour, there would never
      be any possibility of developing, expanding, and improving production.
      Part of the work done must always be devoted to the development and
      improvement of production. If we had to consume and to use up everything
      we have produced, then we could never produce machines, for these cannot
      be eaten or worn. But it is obvious that the bettering of life will go
      hand in hand with the extension and improvement of machinery. It is plain
      that more and more machines must continually be produced. Now this implies
      that part of the labour which has been incorporated in the machines will
      not be returned to the person who has done the work. It implies that no
      one can ever receive the full product of his labour. But nothing of the
      kind is necessary. With the aid of good machinery, production will be so
      arranged that all needs will be satisfied.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">To sum up, at the outset products will be distributed
      <I>in proportion to the work done </I> (which does not mean that the
      worker will receive 'the full product of his labour'); subsequently,
      products will be distributed <I>according to need</I>, for there will be
      an abundance of everything.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><A NAME="021"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 21 Administration in the communist system</H4>
    
    <P>In a communist society there will be no classes. But if there will be no
      classes, this implies that <I>in communist society there will likewise be
      no State</I>.</P>
    
    <P>We have previously seen that the State is a class organization of the
      rulers. The State is always directed by one class against the other. A
      bourgeois State is directed against the proletariat, whereas a proletarian
      State is directed against the bourgeoisie. In the communist social order
      there are neither landlords, nor capitalists, nor wage workers; there are
      simply people - comrades. If there are no classes, then there is no class
      war, and there are no class organizations. Consequently the State has
      ceased to exist. Since there is no class war, the State has become
      superfluous. There is no one to be held in restraint, and there is no one
      to impose restraint.</P>
    
    <P>But how, they will ask us, can this vast organization be set in motion
      without any administration? Who is going to work out the plans for social
      production? Who will distribute labour power? Who is going to keep account
      of social income and expenditure? In a word, who is going to supervise the
      whole affair?</P>
    
    <P>It is not difficult to answer these questions. The main direction will
      be entrusted to various kinds of book-keeping offices or statistical
      bureaux. There, from day to day, account will be kept of production and
      all its needs; there also it will be decided whither workers must be sent,
      whence they must be taken, and how much work there is to be done. And
      inasmuch as, from childhood onwards, all will have been accustomed to
      social labour, and since all will understand that this work is necessary
      and that life goes easier when everything is done according to a
      prearranged plan and when the social order is like a well-oiled machine,
      all will work in accordance with the indications of these statistical
      bureaux. There will be no need for special ministers of State, for police
      and prisons, for laws and decrees - nothing of the sort. Just as in an
      orchestra all the performers watch the conductor's baton and act
      accordingly, so here all will consult the statistical reports and will
      direct their work accordingly.</P>
    
    <P>The State, therefore, has ceased to exist. There are no groups and there
      is no class standing above all other classes. Moreover, in these
      statistical bureaux one person will work today, another tomorrow. The
      bureaucracy, the permanent officialdom, will disappear. The State will die
      out.</P>
    
    <P>Manifestly this will only happen in the fully developed and strongly
      established communist system, after the complete and definitive victory of
      the proletariat; nor will it follow immediately upon that victory. For a
      long time yet, the working class will have to fight against, all its
      enemies, and in especial against the relics of the past, such as sloth,
      slackness, criminality, pride. All these will have to be stamped out. Two
      or three generations of persons will have to grow up under the new
      conditions before the need will pass for laws and punishments and for the
      use of repressive measures by the workers' State. Not until then will all
      the vestiges of the capitalist past disappear. Though in the intervening
      period the existence of the workers' State is indispensable, subsequently,
      in the fully developed communist system, when the vestiges of capitalism
      are extinct, the proletarian State authority will also pass away. The
      proletariat itself will become mingled with all the other strata of the
      population, for everyone will by degrees come to participate in the common
      labour. Within a few decades there will be quite a new world, with new
      people and new customs.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="022"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 22 The development of productive forces in the communit system
    (the advantages of communism)</H4>
    
    <P>As soon as victory has been achieved and as soon as all our wounds have
      been healed, the communist system will rapidly develop the forces of
      production. This more rapid development of the forces of production will
      be due to the following causes.</P>
    
    <P>In the first place, there will have ensued the liberation of the vast
      quantity of human energy which is now absorbed in the class struggle. Just
      think how great is the waste of nervous energy, strength, and labour -
      upon the political struggle, upon strikes, revolts and their suppression,
      trials in the lawcourts, police activities, the State authority, upon the
      daily effort of the two hostile classes. The class war now swallows up
      vast quantities of energy and material means. In the new system this
      energy will be liberated; people will no longer struggle one with another.
      The liberated energy will be devoted to the work of production.</P>
    
    <P>Secondly, the energy and the material means which now are destroyed or
      wasted in competition, crises, and wars, will all be saved. If we consider
      how much is squandered upon wars alone, we shall realize that this amounts
      to an enormous quantity. How much, again, is lost to society through the
      struggle of sellers one with another, of buyers one with another, and of
      sellers with buyers. How much futile destruction results from commercial
      crises. How much needless outlay results from the disorganization and
      confusion that prevail in production. All these energies, which now run to
      waste, will be saved in communist society.</P>
    
    <P>Thirdly, the organization of industry on a purposive plan will not
      merely save us from needless waste, in so far as largescale production is
      always more economical. In addition, it will be possible to improve
      production from the technical side, for work will be conducted in very
      large factories and with the aid of perfected machinery. Under capitalism,
      there are definite limits to the introduction of new machinery. The
      capitalist only introduces new machinery when he cannot procure a
      sufficiency of cheap labour. If he can hire an abundance of cheap labour,
      the capitalist will never instal new machinery, since he can secure ample
      profit without this trouble. The capitalist finds machinery requisite only
      when it reduces his expenses for highly paid labour. Under capitalism,
      however, labour is usually cheap. The bad conditions that prevail among
      the working class become a hindrance to the improvement of manufacturing
      technique. This causal sequence is peculiarly obvious in agriculture. Here
      labour power has always been cheap, and for that reason, the introduction
      of machinery in agricultural work has been extremely slow. In communist
      society, our concern will not be for profit but for the workers. There
      every technical advance will be immediately adopted. The chains which
      capitalism imposed will no longer exist. Technical advances will continue
      to take place under communism, for all will now enjoy a good education,
      and those who under capitalism perished from want - mentally gifted
      workers, for instance - will be able to turn their capacities to full
      account.</P>
    
    <P>In communist society parasitism will likewise disappear. There will be
      no place for the parasites who do nothing and who live at others' cost.
      That which in capitalist society is squandered by the capitalists in
      gluttony, drunkenness, and riotous living, will in communist society be
      devoted to the needs of production. The capitalists, their lackeys, and
      their hangers-on (priests, prostitutes, and the rest), will disappear, and
      all the members of society will be occupied in productive labour.</P>
    
    <P>The communist method of production will signify an enormous development
      of productive forces. As a result, no worker in communist society will
      have to do as much work as of old. The working day will grow continually
      shorter, and people will be to an increasing extent freed from the chains
      imposed on them by nature. As soon as man is enabled to spend less time
      upon feeding and clothing himself, he will be able to devote more time to
      the work of mental development. Human culture will climb to heights never
      attained before. It will no longer be a class culture, but will become a
      genuinely human culture. Concurrently with the disappearance of man's
      tyranny over man, the tyranny of nature over man will likewise vanish. Men
      and women will for the first time be able to lead a life worthy of
      thinking beings instead of a life worthy of brute beasts.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The opponents of communism have always described it as
      a process of sharing things out equally. They declared that the communists
      wanted to confiscate everything and to divide everything up; to parcel out
      the land, to divide up the other means of production, and to share out
      also all the articles of consumption. Nothing could be more absurd than
      this notion. Above all, such a general division is impossible. We could
      share out land, horses and cattle, money, but could not share out
      railways, machinery, steamboats, and various other things of the sort. So
      much for that. Furthermore, such a division, as far as practicable, would
      not merely do no good to anyone, but would be a backward step for mankind.
      It would create a vast number of petty proprietors. But we have already
      seen that out of petty proprietorship and the competition among petty
      proprietors there issues large-scale proprietorship. Thus even if it were
      possible to realize such an equal division, the same old cycle would be
      reproduced.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>Proletarian communism </I> (or proletarian
      socialism) is a huge cooperative commonwealth. It is a sequence of the
      whole development of capitalist society and of the condition of the
      proletariat in that society. It must be carefully distinguished from the
      four following things</FONT></P>
    
    <P>1. <I>Lumpenproletarian socialism</I> (<I>anarchism</I>). The
      anarchists reproach the communists on the ground that communism (so they
      contend) will maintain the State authority in the future society. As we
      have seen, the assertion is false. The essential difference consists in
      this, that the anarchists are far more concerned with dividing up than
      with the organization of production; and that they conceive the
      organization of production as taking the form, not of a huge cooperative
      commonwealth, but of a great number of 'free', small, self-governing
      communes. It need hardly be said that such a social system would fail to
      liberate mankind from nature's yoke, for in it the forces of production
      would not be developed even to the degree to which they have been
      developed under capitalism. Anarchism would not increase production, but
      would disintegrate it. It is natural that, in practice, the anarchists
      should advocate the dividing up of articles of consumption and should
      oppose the organization of large-scale production. They do not, for the
      most part, represent the interests and aspirations of the working class;
      they represent those of what is termed the lumpenproletariat, the
      loaferproletariat; they represent the interests of those who live in bad
      conditions under capitalism, but who are quite incapable of independent
      creative work. </P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">2. <I>Petty-bourgeois socialism</I>. This finds its
      main supporters, not in the proletariat, but in the decaying class of
      independent artisans, among the lower middle-class townsfolk, and in part
      among the intelligentsia (professional classes). It protests against
      large-scale capital, but it does so in the name of the 'freedom' of petty
      enterprise. For the most part the petty-bourgeois socialists advocate
      bourgeois democracy and oppose the social revolution; they hope to attain
      their ideals 'peacefully' - through the development of cooperatives, a
      unified organization of home workers, and so on. In Russia, most of the
      urban cooperatives formed by the social revolutionists exhibit this
      complexion. Under capitalism, cooperative enterprises are apt to
      degenerate into ordinary capitalistic organizations, and the cooperators
      can in this case hardly be distinguished from bourgeois.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>3. Agrarian peasant socialism. </I> This assumes
      various forms, and at times closely resembles peasant anarchism. Its most
      distinctive characteristic is the way in which it habitually fails to look
      upon socialism as a system of large-scale production, and the way in which
      it inclines towards dividing up and towards equalization. Its main
      distinction from anarchism is that it demands the creation of a strong
      central authority which shall protect it on the one hand from the
      landlords and on the other from the proletariat. In this form of socialism
      we have the 'socialization of the land' advocated by the social
      revolutionists, who desire to establish small-scale production in
      perpetuity, who dread the proletariat, and who oppose the formation of a
      great and united cooperative commonwealth. In addition, among certain
      strata of the peasantry, we find yet other varieties of socialism more or
      less akin to anarchism. Here the State authority is repudiated, but the
      advocates of these trends are distinguished by their pacifist views
      (various communistically inclined sectaries, such as the Duhobors, etc.).
      The agrarian types of socialism will not be eradicated until after the
      lapse of a good many years. They will disappear as soon as the masses of
      the peasantry come to realize the advantages of large-scale production. We
      shall return to this matter later in the book.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">4. <I>Slaveholding and large-scale capitalistic
      socialism</I> (<I>so-called</I>). In this form we cannot discern so much
      as a trace of socialism. In the three varieties previously mentioned, we
      find at least some tincture of socialism, and we find in them a protest
      against oppression; but in the fourth variety, the one we are now
      considering, the 'socialism' is a mere word, fraudulently employed by
      those who want a new shuffle of the cards. This variety was introduced by
      bourgeois intellectuals and was taken over from them by the socialist
      advocates of class collaboration (and in part by Kautsky &amp; Co.). Of
      such a character, for example, was the communism of Plato, the philosopher
      of ancient Greece. The essential characteristic of his system was that the
      slaveholders' organization would in 'comradely' fashion and 'jointly'
      exploit the mass of slaves who were to have no legal rights. As far as the
      slave-owners were concerned there would be perfect equality and all things
      would be held in common. The case of the slaves was to be very different;
      they were to become mere cattle. Obviously this has nothing whatever to do
      with socialism. A similar sort of 'socialism' has been advocated by
      certain bourgeois professors under the name of 'State socialism'. The only
      difference from Plato's variety is that contemporary proletarians have
      taken the place of the slaves, while the capitalist magnates sit in the
      seats of the mighty in place of the slaveowners. Here, likewise, there is
      no trace of socialism. We have State capitalism, based upon forced labour.
      To this matter we shall return.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Petty-bourgeois, agrarian, and lumpenproletarian
      socialism have one characteristic common to them all. Such varieties of
      non-proletarian socialism are outside the general course of evolution. The
      course of social evolution leads to the expansion of production. But in
      these nonproletarian varieties the whole trend is towards small-scale
      production. Inevitably, therefore, socialism of this kind is nothing more
      than a utopian dream. There is no likelihood of its actual realization.</FONT></P>

    <H4>§ 23 The dictatorship of the proletariat</H4>
    
    <P>For the realization of the communist system the proletariat must have
      all authority and all power in its hands. The prolet ariat cannot
      overthrow the old world unless it has power in its hands, unless for a
      time it becomes the ruling class. Manifestly the bourgeoisie will not
      abandon its position without a fight. For the bourgeoisie, communism
      signifies the loss of its former power, the loss of its 'freedom' to
      extort blood and sweat from the workers; the loss of its right to rent,
      interest, and profit. Consequently the communist revolution of the
      proletariat, the communist transformation of society, is fiercely resisted
      by the exploiters. It follows that the principal task of the workers'
      government is to crush this opposition ruthlessly. Precisely because the
      opposition will inevitably be so embittered, it is necessary that the
      workers' authority, the proletarian rule, shall take the form of a
      dictatorship. Now 'dictatorship' signifies very strict methods of
      government and a resolute crushing of enemies. It is obvious that in such
      a state of affairs there can be no talk of 'freedom' for everyone. The
      dictatorship of the proletariat is incompatible with freedom for the
      bourgeoisie. This is the very reason why the dictatorship of the
      proletariat is needed: to deprive the bourgeoisie of freedom; to bind it
      hand and foot; to make it impossible for it to carry on a struggle against
      the revolutionary proletariat. The more vigorous the resistance of the
      bourgeoisie, the more desperate the mobilization of its forces, the more
      threatening its attitude, the sterner and harsher must be the proletarian
      dictatorship. In extreme cases the workers' government must not hesitate
      to use the method of the terror. Only when the suppression of the
      exploiters is complete, when they have ceased to resist, when it is no
      longer in their power to injure the working class, will the proletarian
      dictatorship grow progressively milder. Meanwhile the bourgeoisie, little
      by little, will fuse with the proletariat; the workers' State will
      gradually die out; society as a whole will be transformed into a communist
      society in which there will be no classes.</P>
    
    <P>Under the dictatorship of the proletariat (a temporary institution) the
      means of production will from the nature of the case belong, not to
      society as a whole, but only to the proletariat, to its State
      organization. For the time being, the working class, that is the majority
      of the population, monopolizes the means of production. Consequently there
      does not yet exist communist production in all its completeness. There
      still exists the division of society into classes; there is still a
      governing class (the proletariat); all the means of production are
      monopolized by this new governing class; there is still a State authority
      (the proletarian authority) which crushes its enemies. But as the
      resistance of the sometime capitalists, landlords, bankers, generals, and
      bishops, is crushed, in like measure the system of proletarian
      dictatorship will without any revolution undergo transformation into
      communism.</P>
    
    <P>The dictatorship of the proletariat is not only an instrument for the
      crushing of enemies; it is likewise a lever for effecting economic
      transformation. Private ownership of the means of production must be
      replaced by social ownership; the bourgeoisie must be deprived of the
      means of production and exchange, must be 'expropriated'. Who will and can
      do this? Obviously no isolated individual could do it, even if he should
      be of proletarian origin. If it were to be done by an isolated individual
      or even by isolated groups of individuals, at the best it would be nothing
      more than a dividing up, and at the worst it would be a mere act of
      robbery. We understand, therefore, why the expropriation of the
      bourgeoisie must be effected by the organized power of the proletariat.
      Now this organized power takes the form of the dictatorial workers' State.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Objections to the dictatorship of the proletariat arise
      from various quarters. First of all come the <I>anarchists</I>. They say
      that they are in revolt against all authority and against every kind of
      State, whereas the communist bolsheviks are the sustainers of the Soviet
      Government. Every kind of government, they continue, involves the abuse of
      power and the limitation of freedom. For this reason it is necessary to
      overthrow the bolsheviks, the Soviet Government, the dictatorship of the
      proletariat. No dictatorship is necessary, no State is necessary. Such are
      the arguments of the anarchists. Only in appearance is their criticism
      revolutionary. In actual fact the anarchists do not stand more to the
      left, but more to the right than the bolsheviks. Why, indeed, do we need
      the dictatorship? We need it for the <I>organized</I> destruction of the
      bourgeois régime; we need it that we may crush the enemies of the
      proletariat <I>by force</I>. Quite openly we say, by force. The
      dictatorship is the axe in the hands of the proletariat. Anyone who is
      opposed to the dictatorship of the proletariat is one who is afraid of
      decisive action, is afraid of hurting the bourgeoisie, is no
      revolutionist. When we have completely vanquished the bourgeoisie, the
      need for the dictatorship of the proletariat will no longer exist. But as
      long as the life-and-death struggle continues it is absolutely incumbent
      upon the working class to crush its enemies utterly. AN EPOCH OF
      PROLETARIAN DICTATORSHIP MUST INEVITABLY INTERVENE BETWEEN A CAPITALIST
      AND A COMMUNIST SOCIETY.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Next, as objectors to the dictatorship, come the social
      democrats, and in especial the mensheviks. These worthies have completely
      forgotten what they wrote about the matter in former days. In our old
      programme, drawn up by ourselves and the mensheviks together, it is
      expressly stated: 'An essential condition of the social revolution is the
      dictatorship of the proletariat, that is to say the conquest of political
      power by the proletariat, which will enable the workers to crush all
      resistance on the part of the exploiters.' The mensheviks signed this
      statement. But when the time came for action, they raised a clamour
      against the crushing of the freedom of the bourgeoisie, against the
      suppression of bourgeois newspapers, against the bolshevist 'reign of
      terror', and so on. Even Plekhanoff, at one time, thoroughly approved of
      the most ruthless measures against the bourgeoisie, saying that we could
      deprive the bourgeois of their electoral rights, and so on. Nowadays the
      mensheviks have forgotten all this; they have taken refuge in the camp of
      the bourgeoisie.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Finally, a number of moral considerations are brought
      into the argument against us. We are told that we form our judgements like
      the savage Hottentots. The Hottentot says: 'When I steal my neighbour's
      wife, it is good; when he steals my wife, it is bad.' The bolsheviks, it
      is contended, resemble these savages, for they say: 'When the bourgeoisie
      uses force to crush the proletariat, it is bad; but when the proletariat
      uses force to crush the bourgeoisie, it is good.' Those who argue thus, do
      not know what they are talking about. In the case of the Hottentots we are
      concerned with two equal individuals who are stealing one another's wives
      for identical reasons. But the proletariat and the bourgeoisie are not on
      equal terms. Proletarians comprise an enormous class, bourgeois form a
      comparatively small group. The proletariat is fighting for the liberation
      of all mankind; but the bourgeoisie is fighting for the maintenance of
      oppression, wars, exploitation. The proletariat is fighting for communism,
      the bourgeoisie for the preservation of capitalism. If capitalism and
      communism were one and the same thing, then the bourgeoisie and the
      proletariat could be compared to the two Hottentots. The proletariat is
      fighting solely on behalf of the new social order. Whatever helps in the
      struggle is good; whatever hinders, is bad.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><A NAME="024"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 24 The conquest of political power</H4>
    
    <P>The proletariat makes its dictatorship actual through the conquest of
      the State power. But what do we mean by the conquest of power? Many
      persons imagine that it is quite an easy matter to wrest power from the
      bourgeoisie, as easy as to transfer a ball from one pocket to another.
      First, power is in the hands of the bourgeoisie; then the proletariat will
      drive the bourgeoisie from power and will take the reins into its own
      hands. According to this view, the problem is not the creation of a new
      power, but the seizure of a power that already exists.</P>
    
    <P>Such a notion is utterly false, and a very little reflection will show
      us where the error lies.</P>
    
    <P>The State power is an organization. The bourgeois State power is a
      bourgeois organization, and in that organization people are assigned their
      roles in a distinctive manner. At the head of the army are generals,
      members of the wealthy class; at the head of the administration are
      ministers, members of the wealthy class; and so on. When the proletariat
      is fighting for power, against whom and what is it fighting? In the first
      place, against this bourgeois organization. Now when it is fighting this
      organization, its task is to deliver blows that will destroy the
      organization. But since the main strength of the government resides in the
      army, if we wish to gain the victory over the bourgeoisie, the first
      essential is to disorganize and destroy the bourgeois army. The German
      communists could not overthrow the régime of Scheidemann and Noske
      unless they could destroy the army of White Guards. If the opposing army
      remain intact, the victory of the revolution will be impossible; if the
      revolution be victorious, the army of the bourgeoisie will disintegrate
      and crumble. This, for example, is why the victory over tsarism signified
      no more than a partial destruction of the tsarist State and a partial
      decomposition of the army; but the victory of the November revolution
      denoted the final overthrow of the State organization of the Provisional
      Government and the total dissolution of the Kerenskyite army.</P>
    
    <P>Thus the revolution destroys the old power and creates a new one, a
      different power from that which existed before. Of course the new power
      takes over some of the constituent parts of the old, but it uses them in a
      different way.</P>
    
    <P>It follows that the conquest of State power is not the conquest of the
      pre-existent organization, but the creation of a new organization, an
      organization brought into being by the class which has been victorious in
      the struggle.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The practical importance of this question is enormous.
      The German bolsheviks, for example, have been reproached (as the Russian
      bolsheviks were formerly reproached) on the ground that they have led to
      disintegration in the army and have promoted indiscipline, have encouraged
      disobedience to officers. This used to be considered; and by many is still
      considered, a terrible charge. But there is nothing terrible about it. We
      must promote disintegration in an army which is ranged against the workers
      and is at the orders of the bourgeoisie, even though the latter consists
      of our fellow-countrymen. Failing this, the revolution will succumb.
      Consequently, there is nothing to be afraid of in working for the
      disintegration of such a bourgeois army; a revolutionist who destroys the
      State apparatus of the bourgeoisie may consider that he is doing excellent
      service. Where bourgeois discipline remains intact, the bourgeoisie is
      invincible. Those who wish to overthrow the bourgeoisie must not shrink
      from hurting it.</FONT></P>

    <H4>§ 25 The communist party and the classes of capitalist society</H4>
    
    <P>In order that the proletariat may gain the victory in any country, it is
      essential that it should be compact and well organized; it is essential
      that it should have its own Communist Party which has clearly recognized
      the trend of capitalist development, which has understood the actual
      situation and the true interests of the working class, which has
      adequately interpreted that situation, which is competent to marshal the
      ranks and to conduct the battle. Nowhere and at no time has any part been
      able to enrol all the members of the class which it represents; never has
      any class attained the requisite degree of consciousness. Generally
      speaking, those who organize themselves into a party are the most advanced
      members of a class; those who best understand their class interests; those
      who are most daring, most energetic, and most stubborn in the fight. For
      this reason, the number of adherents of the party is always considerably
      less than the number of those composing the class whose interests the
      party represents. Since, however, a party definitely represents the
      rightly interpreted interests of the class, parties usually play a leading
      role. The party leads the whole class, and the struggle between <I>classes</I>
      for power finds expression in the struggle between <I>political parties</I>
      for power. He who wishes to understand the nature of political parties
      must study the relationships of the various classes in capitalist society.
      Out of these relationships definite class interests arise. As we have
      already learned, the defence of class interests is the essential purpose
      of political parties.</P>
    
    <P><I>Landowners</I>. During the first period of capitalist development,
      agrarian economy was based upon the semi-slave labour of the peasants. The
      landowners leased lands to the peasants, receiving as rent payment either
      in money or in kind. One method of payment in kind was for the worker to
      spend half his time tilling the landowner's estate. The landowners as a
      class found it to their interest to prevent the peasants from going to the
      towns; they therefore resisted all innovation; they desired to maintain
      the old semi-slave conditions in the villages; they opposed the
      development of manufacturing industry. Such landowners possessed ancient
      patrimonial seigneurial domains; very few of them did any work on their
      own estates, and they lived for the most part like parasites on the backs
      of the peasants. As a result of this state of affairs, the parties
      representing the landowners have always been and still are the main props
      of reaction. These are the political parties that everywhere desire a
      return to the old order; they want to go back to the rule of the
      landlords, to restore the landlord-tsar (the monarch), to ensure the
      predominance of the 'blue-blooded gentry', to effect the complete
      enslavement of the peasants and the workers. They form what are known as
      the conservative parties; it would be more accurate to term them the
      reactionary parties. Since from time immemorial the officers of the army
      and the navy have been drawn from the ranks of the landed gentry, it is
      perfectly natural that landowners' parties should always be on the best of
      terms with generals and admirals. This is what we find in every country
      throughout the world.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">As an example may be mentioned the members of the
      Prussian junker caste (in Germany, the great landowners are known as
      'junkets') who send some of their sons into the officers' corps. Similarly
      in Russia we have our landed gentry, the so-called backwoodsmen, 'the
      aurochses', like some of the deputies to the duma - Markov the Second,
      Krupensky, and others. The tsarist council of state was largely composed
      of members of this landlord class. Most of the wealthy landowners
      belonging to. old families bear such titles as prince, count, etc.; they
      are the true descendants of ancestors who owned thousands of bondslaves.
      The landlords' parties in Russia were: the League of the Russian People;
      the Nationalist Party, led by Krupensky; the right Octobrists; etc.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><I>The capitalist bourgeoisie</I>. The interest of this class is to
      secure the greatest possible profits out of the developing 'national
      industry', that is to say out of surplus value extracted from the working
      class. Manifestly this interest does not fully coincide with that of the
      landowners. When capital makes its influence felt in village life, the old
      conditions are disturbed. The peasants are attracted into the towns;
      capital creates a vast proletariat, and it arouses new needs in the
      villages; the peasants, hitherto docile and quiet, grow 'unruly'. The
      landowners, the backwoodsmen, find these innovations unpleasing. On the
      other hand, the capitalist bourgeoisie regards them as full of promise.
      The more the workers are lured from the villages to the towns, the more
      wage labour, consequently, is available for the service of the capitalist,
      and the cheaper can the capitalist hire it. The more completely village
      life is ruined and the greater the extent to which the petty producers
      cease to produce various articles for themselves, the more essential do
      they find it to buy these products from the large-scale manufacturers. The
      more rapid, therefore, the disappearance of the old conditions in which
      the village produced everything for itself, the greater will be the
      expansion of the market for the sale of factory-produced commodities, and
      the higher will be the profits of the capitalist class.</P>
    
    <P>For this reason the capitalist class rails at landlords of the old
      school. (There are, in addition, capitalist landlords; these run their
      estates with the help of wage labour and with the aid of machinery; their
      interests are closely akin to those of the bourgeoisie, and they usually
      adhere to the parties of the wealthier capitalists.) But of course the
      chief struggle of the capitalists is with the working class. When the
      working class is fighting mainly against the landlords and very little
      against the bourgeoisie, the latter eyes approvingly the struggle of the
      working class. This was the case in the year 1904, and in 1905 until
      October. But when the workers begin to realize their communist interests
      and to march against the bourgeoisie, then the bourgeoisie joins forces
      with the landlords against the workers. Everywhere, today, the parties of
      the capitalist bourgeoisie (the so-called liberal parties) are carrying on
      a fierce struggle against the revolutionary proletariat, and it is they
      who form the political general staff of the counter-revolution.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Among such parties in Russia, two may be mentioned.
      First of all we have the Party of Popular Freedom, also known as the Party
      of Constitutional Democrats; from the initials of its name (CD) its
      members are generally spoken of as the 'Cadets'. Secondly there are the
      Octobrists, who have now almost disappeared. Members of the industrial
      bourgeoisie, capitalist landlords, bankers, and the champions of all these
      (the major intelligentsia - university professors, successful lawyers and
      authors, factory managers, etc.) form the nuclei of these parties. In the
      year 1905 the Cadets were murmuring against the autocracy, but they were
      already afraid of the workers and the peasants; after the revolution of
      March 1917, they became the leaders of all the forces that were marshalled
      against the party of the working class, against the communist bolsheviks.
      In the years 1918 and 1919 the Cadets took the lead in all the plots
      against the Soviet Government, and they participated in the
      administrations of General Denikin and Admiral Kolchak. In a word, they
      led the bloody reaction, and finally they even formed a coalition with the
      landowners' parties. For under the pressure of the working class movement
      all groups of wealthy proprietors unite in a single camp of reactionaries,
      led by the most energetic section among them.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><I>The urban petty bourgeoisie</I>. To this group belong the
      independent artisans, the small shopkeepers, the minor intelligentsia
      comprising the salariat, and the lesser officialdom. In reality they do
      not constitute a class, but a motley crowd. All these elements are
      exploited more or less by capital, and they are often overworked. Many of
      them are ruined in the course of capitalist development. The conditions of
      their work, however, are such that for the most part they fail to realize
      how hopeless is their situation under capitalism. Let us consider, for
      instance, the independent artisan. He is an industrious as an ant. Capital
      exploits him in various ways: the usurer exploits him; the shop for which
      he works, exploits him; and so on. The artisan feels himself to be a
      'master'; he works with his own tools, and in appearance he is
      'independent', although in reality he is completely entangled in the web
      of the capitalist spider. He lives in the perennial hope of bettering
      himself, thinking always, ' I shall soon be able to extend my business,
      then I shall buy for myself'; he is careful not to mix with the workers,
      and in his manners he avoids imitating them, affecting the manners of the
      gentry, for he always hopes to become a 'gentleman' himself. Consequently,
      although he is as poor as a church mouse, he usually feels more akin to
      the man who exploits him than he does to the workers. The petty-bourgeois
      parties commonly assemble under the standard of the 'radicals' or the
      'republicans', but sometimes under that of the 'socialists' (refer to the
      small-type paragraphs of <A HREF="#022">§22)</A>. It is extremely
      difficult to shake such people out of this wrong attitude of mind, which
      is their misfortune not their fault.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In Russia, more commonly than elsewhere, the
      petty-bourgeois parties have been apt to wear a socialist mask. This was
      done by the populist socialists, the social revolutionaries, and in part
      by the mensheviks. It is necessary to point out that the social
      revolutionaries tended to rely mainly upon the middle peasants and the
      rich peasants for support.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><I>The peasantry</I>. In the rural districts, the peasantry occupies a
      position closely akin to that occupied by the petty bourgeoisie in the
      towns. It too, properly speaking, does not constitute a single class, for
      under capitalism it is continually splitting up into classes. In every
      village and hamlet we find that some of the peasants go to look for work
      in the towns, and thus in time become completely transformed into
      proletarians; others develop into wealthy and usurious peasants. The
      'middle' peasants form an unstable stratum. Many of them are ruined in
      course of time; they become 'horseless men', and eventually seek work as
      agricultural labourers or as factory hands; others are more successful,
      'get on in the world', gather wealth, become 'master peasants', hire
      agricultural labourers, make use of machinery - in a word, they are
      transformed into capitalist entrepreneurs. That is why we are entitled to
      say that the peasantry does not properly speaking form a single class.
      Among the peasants we must distinguish at least three groups. First we
      have the rich peasants, the master peasants, who constitute a rural
      bourgeoisie, for they are exploiters of wage labour. Next come the middle
      peasants, who work their own little farms and do not exploit wage labour.
      Thirdly and lastly, we have the poor peasants forming the rural
      semi-proletariat and proletariat.</P>
    
    <P>It is easy to understand that the members of these respective groups,
      owing to the difference in their positions, will take different views of
      the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The rich
      peasants are as a rule allied with the bourgeoisie, and very often with
      the great landlords as well. In Germany, for example, those who are termed
      'great peasants' are united in a single organization with the priests and
      the landlords. We find the same thing in Switzerland and in Austria, and
      to some extent also in France. In Russia, during the year 1918, the rich
      peasants supported all the counter-revolutionary plots. Those belonging to
      the semi-proletarian and proletarian strata naturally back the workers in
      their struggle with the bourgeoisie and the rich peasants. As far as the
      middle peasants are concerned, the matter is much more complicated.</P>
    
    <P>If the middle peasants would only realize that for the majority among
      them there is no way out under capitalism, that only a few of them can
      ever hope to become rich peasants, whereas most of them are fated to live
      in penury, then they would be ready to give unstinted support to the
      workers. But their misfortune lies in this, that the same thing happens to
      them as happens in the towns to the independent artisans and the members
      of the petty bourgeoisie. Every one of them, at the bottom of his heart,
      cherishes the hope of getting on, of growing rich. But, on the other hand,
      the middle peasant is oppressed by the capitalist, the money-lender, the
      landlord, and the rich peasant. The result is, as a rule, that the middle
      peasant seesaws between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. He is unable
      wholeheartedly to adopt the working class platform, but at the same time
      he is terribly afraid of the landowner.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This wobbling has been peculiarly plain in Russia. The
      middle peasants supported the workers against the landlords and the rich
      peasants. Then, growing afraid lest they should not be so well off in the
      'commune', they listened to the advice of the rich peasants and opposed
      the workers. Still later, when danger threatened from the side of the
      landowning class (Denikin, Kolchak), they were once more inclined to
      espouse the cause of the workers.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The same vacillation has been displayed in the party
      struggle. At one time the middle peasants would adhere to the party of the
      workers, the party of the communist bolsheviks; at another time they would
      adhere to the party of the rich peasants, the party of the essers (social
      revolutionaries).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><I>The working class </I>(<I>the proletariat</I>). This class consists
      of those who 'have nothing to lose but their chains'. Not only are they
      exploited by the capitalists; but in addition, as we have already learned,
      the very course of capitalist development leads to their solidarization
      into a homogeneous power, consisting of persons accustomed to work
      together and to fight together. For this reason, the working class is the
      most progressive class in capitalist society. For this reason, likewise,
      the party of the working class is the most progressive, the most
      revolutionary party that can possibly exist.</P>
    
    <P>It is natural, moreover, that the aim of this party should be to bring
      about the communist revolution. To this end, the proletarian party must be
      absolutely uncompromising. Its function is not to chaffer with the
      bourgeoisie, but to hurl the bourgeoisie from power and to crush the
      resistance of the capitalists. This party must 'reveal the absolute
      conflict of interests as between exploiters and exploited' (the words were
      used in our old programme, which was signed by the mensheviks; but, alas,
      the mensheviks have quite forgotten them, and are now hand in glove with
      the bourgeoisie).</P>
    
    <P>What, however, should be the attitude of our party towards the petty
      bourgeoisie, towards the non-proletarian poorer strata of our large towns,
      and towards the middle peasants?</P>
    
    <P>This is clear from what has been said above. We must never weary in our
      proofs and explanations, in order to convince them that their hopes for a
      better life under capitalism are the outcome of fraud by others or are due
      to their own self-deception. We must patiently and clearly demonstrate to
      the middle peasants that they ought unhesitatingly to enter the
      proletarian camp, and despite all difficulties fight shoulder to shoulder
      with the workers; it is our duty to show them that the only peasants to
      gain by the victory of the bourgeoisie will be the rich peasants, who will
      in that case become transformed into a new landlord class. In a word, we
      must bring all those who work, to make common cause with the proletariat;
      must enable all those who work, to see things from the working class point
      of view. Those who belong to the petty bourgeoisie and to the stratum of
      the middle peasants, are full of prejudices arising out of the conditions
      of their lives. It is our duty to reveal the true posture of affairs. We
      must show that the position of the artisan and of the working peasant
      under capitalism is quite hopeless, and that they had better give up
      trying to amuse themselves with fancy pictures. We must tell the middle
      peasant that as long as capitalism lasts there will always be a landlord
      riding on his back: either one of the gentry, the old type of landlord; or
      else a rich peasant, the landlord of the new type. In no other way than
      through the victory and the strengthening of the proletariat is there any
      possibility of rebuilding life on new foundations. But, since the victory
      of the proletariat can only be secured through the organization of the
      workers and through the existence of a strong, solid, and resolute party,
      we must draw into our ranks all those who labour, all those to whom the
      new life is dear, all those who have learned to think and to fight like
      proletarians.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">How important the existence of a solid and militant
      communist party is, can be learned from the examples of Germany and
      Russia. In Germany, where the proletariat is highly developed, there was
      nevertheless prior to the war no such militant party of the working class
      as that of the communist bolsheviks in Russia. Only during the war did
      comrades Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, and others begin to found a
      distinctively communist party. This is why, during the years 1918 and
      1919, notwithstanding a number of risings, the German workers proved
      unable to overthrow the bourgeoisie. In Russia, however, there existed our
      uncompromisingly communist party. Thanks to this the Russian proletariat
      was well led. Hence, despite all difficulties, the Russian proletariat was
      the first to secure a solid and speedy victory. In this respect our party
      may and does serve as an example to other communist parties. Its solidity
      and discipline are universally recognized. It is, in fact, the most
      militant party of the proletarian revolution, and as such it occupies the
      leading place.</FONT></P>
