    <H3>Chapter 8: The Programme of the Communists in relation to Army
    Organization</H3>
    
    <H4><A NAME="061"></A>§ 61. Our old programme, and the question of war
    in a socialist state</H4>
    
    <P>In <A HREF="01.htm#012">§12</A> we explained how the standing army
      of the bourgeois State is constructed and for what purposes it is used.
      The socialists of all countries, including the Russian social democrats,
      used to demand the abolition of standing armies. Instead of a standing
      army, the socialists wanted the general arming of the people (a citizen
      army); they demanded the abolition of the officers' caste, and the
      election of officers by the rank and file.</P>
    
    <P>Let us consider what should be the communists' attitude towards these
      demands.</P>
    
    <P>The first question that arises in this connexion is, on behalf of what
      form of social order the before-mentioned demands were made. Were they
      made for a bourgeois society, or for a socialist society, or for a society
      in the throes of the struggle between bourgeoisdom and socialism?</P>
    
    <P>The socialist parties adhering to the Second International had no clear
      ideas concerning the nature of the society in relation to which their
      programme was drawn up. For the most part, indeed, their programme related
      to a bourgeois society. What the socialists usually had in their minds as
      model was the Swiss Republic, where there is no standing army but a
      national militia.</P>
    
    <P>It is obvious that the army programme of the socialists was unrealizable
      in bourgeois society, above all during an epoch in which the class
      struggle was continually growing more acute. To abolish barracks signifies
      the abolition of the places where the workers and the peasants are trained
      to become the executioners of their own class brothers. It signifies the
      abolition of the only places in which it is possible to transform the
      workers into an army which will be ready to use its weapons against other
      nations at any moment which may suit the capitalists. To abolish the
      officers' caste signifies the abolition of the beast tamers who are alone
      competent to maintain an iron discipline, and who are alone able to
      subject the armed people to the will of the bourgeois class. The election
      of officers would enable the armed workers and peasants to choose officers
      from among themselves, officers who would not be bourgeois. For the
      bourgeoisie to agree to such proposals would mean that it was consenting
      to the formation of an army which was intended to subvert its own régime.</P>
    
    <P>The whole history of capitalism in Europe has demonstrated and continues
      to demonstrate the impossibility of carrying out the old army programme of
      the socialist party within the framework of bourgeois society, of carrying
      it out while society is divided into classes and in days when the class
      struggle is growing more acute. In proportion as the class struggle is
      intensified do we find that the bourgeois rulers are disinclined to arm
      the whole nation and are determined to put arms in the hands of their
      trusted White Guards only. The army programme of the socialists, in so far
      as they hoped to realize it in the bourgeois régime, was,
      therefore, nothing but petty-bourgeois utopism.</P>
    
    <P>Is it not possible, however, that the programme was formulated with the
      definite aim of overthrowing the bourgeois régime? This was not the
      case. The bourgeoisie wishes to defend itself against the working class,
      which hopes to seize power. It will therefore never entertain the idea of
      arming the workers. The bourgeoisie has introduced universal military
      service and has entrusted the worker-soldier with a rifle only for so long
      as it can hope that the soldiers drawn from the people will continue to
      obey the orders of their capitalist rulers. But directly the people thinks
      of fighting for its own land, the people must be disarmed! All shrewd
      bourgeois politicians are well aware of this. Conversely, it would be
      quite unreasonable for the workers and peasants to think of arming the
      whole nation, when what they wish is to arm themselves that they may
      overthrow the bourgeoisie and seize power. It follows, therefore, that for
      the transitional period in which the proletariat is struggling for power,
      the old army programme of the socialists is futile. Such a programme is
      only applicable for the very brief period during which the pre-existing
      bourgeois standing army is being broken up. It is only applicable during
      the period when the officers' caste is being abolished and when the
      question of the election of officers by the rank and file arises. In the
      year 1917, the bolsheviks actually carried out this idea, which was part
      of their old programme. By suppressing the officers' caste in what had
      been the tsarist army and in the Kerenskyite army, the bolsheviks deprived
      that army of its sting, so that it was no longer subject to the
      bourgeois-landlord class.</P>
    
    <P>On the other hand, for a society in which socialism has been victorious,
      the old army programme is fully applicable. When the proletariat has
      overthrown the bourgeoisie and has abolished class in quite a number of
      countries, it will be possible to carry out a general arming of the
      people. Then the working population alone will be armed, for in a
      socialist society all will be workers. It will be possible to do away with
      barrack life completely. It will also be possible to introduce the
      election of officers, a method which during the period of accentuated
      civil war is, except in rare and fortunate cases, unsuitable for the
      proletarian army.</P>
    
    <P>A very natural question now arises. What need can there be for the
      general arming of the people in lands where a socialist régime
      prevails? In certain countries, let us suppose, the bourgeoisie has been
      conquered; those who were bourgeois have become workers; there can be no
      question of war between socialist States. But it is necessary to remember
      that socialism cannot gain the victory simultaneously in all the countries
      of the world. Some countries will, of course, lag behind the others in the
      matter of abolishing class and of realizing socialism. In such
      circumstances, the, countries in which the bourgeoisie has been overthrown
      and where all the bourgeois have become workers, may have to fight or to
      be prepared to fight against the bourgeoisies of those States in which the
      dictatorship of the proletariat has not yet been established; or they may
      have to give armed assistance to the proletariat of those lands in which
      the dictatorship of the working class has been inaugurated but in which
      the struggle with the bourgeoisie has not yet been carried to a successful
      issue.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="062"></A>§ 62. The need for the Red Army; its class
    composition</H4>
    
    <P>Most of the socialists who adhere to the Second International consider
      that socialism can be realized by securing a parliamentary majority. Since
      the socialists of this calibre were cradled in such ideas, since they were
      nurtured in the peaceful atmosphere of petty-bourgeois villadom, it was
      natural that they should give no heed to the possibility of or the need
      for organizing a proletarian army in the period of the fight for
      socialism. Other socialists, though they recognized the inevitability of a
      forcible transformation effected by the armed workers, failed nevertheless
      to foresee that this armed struggle would be long drawn out, that Europe
      would have to pass through a phase, not only of socialist revolutions, but
      also of socialist wars. Consequently not one of the socialist programmes
      voiced the need for the organization of the Red Army, that is to say, of
      an army consisting of the armed workers and peasants. First in all the
      world,<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP> the Russian
      working class was able to create such an army. We mean that, first in all
      the world, the Russian workers were able to get a firm grip of the State
      authority, and were able to defend what they had gained against the
      attacks of the Russian bourgeoisie and against the onslaughts of
      international capitalism. It is perfectly clear that without the Red Army
      the Russian workers and peasants would have found it impossible to
      maintain a single one of the achievements of their revolution. Without the
      Red Army they would have been crushed by the forces of reaction at home
      and abroad. A Red Army cannot be established upon the foundation of
      universal military service. While the struggle is still in progress, the
      proletariat, even though success is in sight, cannot venture to entrust
      rifles to members of the urban bourgeoisie or to the rich peasants. The
      proletarian army must be exclusively composed of persons belonging to the
      working class, of persons who do not exploit labour and who are directly
      interested in the victory of the workers' revolution. Only the industrial
      workers of the towns and the poor peasants from the villages should form
      the nucleus and the foundation of the Red Army, which will be converted
      into an army of all the working population by the adhesion of the middle
      peasants. As far as the members of the bourgeoisie and of the rich stratum
      of the peasantry are concerned, they must fulfil their military
      obligations to the proletarian State by militia duties at a distance from
      the fighting front. Of course this must not be considered to imply that a
      sufficiently powerful proletarian authority will refrain, in its turn,
      from compelling the exploiters to shoot at their White friends in the
      opposing trenches, just as the bourgeoisie, with the aid of its standing
      army, forced the proletarians to shoot their class brothers.</P>
    
    <P>The standing army of the bourgeoisie, although it is established upon
      the basis of universal military service, and although in appearance it is
      an army of the whole people, is in reality a class army. But the
      proletariat need not hide the class character of its army, any more than
      it hides the class character of its dictatorship. The Red Army is one of
      the organs of the Soviet State, and is, generally speaking, constructed
      upon the same type as the other State organs of the proletarian
      dictatorship. Just as in the Soviet elections the soviet constitution
      gives no vote to persons whose whole economic and political position that
      constitution aims at undermining, so in the Red Army there is no place for
      those for whose destruction in the civil war the Red Army exists.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="063"></A>§ 63. Universal military training of the workers</H4>
    
    <P>One of the primary aims of the system of military training for the
      workers which the Russian Soviet Republic has set out to realize, must be
      to reduce barrack life to a minimum. As far as possible, the workers and
      peasants must not be withdrawn from the work of production while they are
      being trained for military service. This will greatly diminish expenditure
      upon the army and will obviate the slackening down and disorganization of
      production. Workers and peasants who are trained to arms in their spare
      time, fit themselves to be soldiers of the revolution without ceasing to
      be producers of value.</P>
    
    <P>The second great need in connexion with the universal military training
      of the workers is to create in every town, and in every rural district,
      proletarian and peasant reserves able to take the field at a moment's
      notice on the approach of the enemy. The experience of the civil war in
      Russia has shown how important such reserves are for the success of the
      socialist campaign. It suffices to remember how the regiments of the
      workers' reserves successfully defended Petrograd from the White Guards;
      or to think of the workers of the Ural region and the Donetz basin; or of
      the workers and peasants in the town and province of Orenburg, in the town
      of Uralsk, etc.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="064"></A>§ 64. Self-imposed discipline versus discipline
    imposed from above</H4>
    
    <P>Self-imposed discipline is impossible in an imperialist army. The very
      nature of such an army forbids the idea. An imperialist army consists of
      various social groups. The workers and peasants have been forcibly herded
      into the barracks of the bourgeois army. Should they begin to realize
      their own interests, far from consciously submitting to the discipline
      imposed by their epauletted superiors, they would consciously resist this
      discipline. For this reason, the discipline of bourgeois armies must be
      maintained by force; for this reason, flogging, tortures of every kind,
      and mass shootings, are not simply occasional incidents, but the
      foundations of order, discipline, 'military education'.</P>
    
    <P>On the other hand, in the Red Army, which is formed by the workers and
      the peasants and which defends their interests, coercive discipline must
      to an ever greater extent be replaced by the workers' voluntary acceptance
      of the discipline of the civil war. As the Red Army grows more clearly
      aware of its own nature, the Red soldiers come to realize that in the last
      resort they are commanded by the whole working class, through the
      instrumentality of the workers' State and its military staff. Thus the
      discipline of the Red Army is the submission of the minority (the
      soldiers) to the interests of the majority of the workers. Every
      reasonable order is backed, not by the commanding officer and his
      arbitrary will, not by the bourgeois minority and its predatory interests,
      but by the whole Workers' and Peasants' Republic. In the Red Army,
      therefore, propaganda and agitation, the political education of the rank
      and file, assume peculiar importance.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="065"></A>§ 65. The political commissars and the communist
    groups</H4>
    
    <P>In the Russian Soviet Republic, in which all workers can express their
      will through the soviets, the workers and peasants have for the last two
      years been electing communists to the various executive organs. The
      Communist Party - we put the matter in bourgeois phraseology - has become
      by the will of the masses the ruling party of the republic, for no other
      party was capable of conducting the victorious workers' and peasants'
      revolution to a successful issue. As a result of this, our party has
      become as it were a huge executive committee of the proletarian
      dictatorship. This is why the communists fill the leading role in the Red
      Army. The political commissars are the representatives of the class willof
      the proletariat inthe army; they are mandated by the party and the
      military centres. Thereby are determined the mutual relationships of the
      commissar alike with the military staff and with the communist groups of
      the division to which he is assigned. The communist group is a section of
      the ruling party; the commissar is a plenipotentiary of the party as a
      whole. Thence derives his leading role, both in the army division, and in
      the communist groups of that division. Thence, likewise, his right to
      supervise the military staff. He is a political leader who acts as
      overseer to watch the technical experts performing their duties.</P>
    
    <P>The task of the communist groups is to give to the soldiers of the Red
      Army clear ideas concerning the civil war, and concerning the need that
      they should subordinate their interests to the interests of all the
      workers. A further duty of the members of the communist groups in the army
      is, by personal example, to display their devotion to the revolution, and
      to arouse in their fellow-soldiers a desire to emulate this example. The
      members of the communist groups are further entitled to watch how their
      own commissar and other commissars perform their communist duties, and
      they can endeavour (by appealing to the supreme party organizations or to
      responsible commissars) to secure that necessary measures shall be carried
      into effect. Thus only can the Communist Party - without any infringement
      of general military discipline on the part of Red soldiers who are
      communists - secure complete control over all its members and prevent any
      misuse of power on their side.</P>
    
    <P>Apart from the communist groups in the army and apart from the political
      commissars, the political education of the Red Army is supervised by a
      whole network of political sections in the divisions and in the armies at
      the various fronts, and it is also supervised by the propaganda sections
      of the Commissariat for War. In its various departments, the proletarian
      State of Russia has created a mighty instrument for the enlightenment and
      organization of its army, and it endeavours to secure the maximum of
      result with the minimum of effort. Thanks to the existence of this
      apparatus, the work of agitation and enlightenment in our army is not
      carried on fortuitously, but has a systematized character. The newspaper,
      the spoken word at meetings, and scholastic instruction, are ensured for
      every soldier of the Red Army.</P>
    
    <P>Unfortunately, however, the above-described organizations have not
      escaped the common lot of all the organizations of the Soviet Power. They
      have succumbed to bureaucracy; they have tended towards a detachment from
      the masses, on the one hand, and from the party, on the other; and in
      practice they have often shown themselves to be harbours of refuge for
      idlers and incapables who belong to the party war-office officialdom. A
      vigorous campaign against such abuses would seem to be of far more urgent
      importance to the Communist Party than the campaign against bureaucracy
      and slackness in the general soviet mechanism, for upon the success of the
      former campaign our speedy victory in the civil war must be said in a
      sense to depend.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="066"></A>§ 66. Structure of the Red Army</H4>
    
    <P>In our system of universal military training, barrack life must be
      reduced to a minimum, so that ultimately the Red barracks may completely
      disappear. The structure of the Red Army must be gradually approximated to
      the structure of the productive units of the workers, whereby the
      artificial character of military unification will be overcome. We may
      express the matter more clearly by saying that the typical standing army
      of tsarist days, the standing army in the State of the bourgeoisie and the
      landed gentry, was composed of persons belonging to the most diverse
      classes. Those who were called up for service were forcibly dragged from
      their natural surroundings: the worker, from the factory; the peasant,
      from the plough; the clerk, from the desk; the shopman, from the counter.
      The recruits were then artificially assembled in barracks, and distributed
      in the various army divisions. It was advantageous to the bourgeois State
      to break off all connexion between the proletarian recruit and his factory
      and between the peasant recruit and his village, so as to make of worker
      and peasant alike blind tools for the oppression of the labouring masses,
      and so that it might be easy to employ the workers and peasants of one
      province to shoot down those of another.</P>
    
    <P>In the upbuilding of the Red Army, the Communist Party works in the
      opposite way. Although the conditions of the civil war have frequently
      compelled the party to make the best of the old methods of organization,
      the essential aspiration is towards something utterly different. Our aim
      has been to ensure that the army subdivisions in the course of their
      construction (the company, the battalion, the regiment, the brigade, etc.)
      shall harmonize as far as may be with the factory, the workshop, the
      village, the hamlet, and so on. In other words, our aim is to remodel the
      artificial military unity - a unity which existed only for its own sake -
      into a natural, productive unity of the workers, and thus to reduce the
      artificiality of army life. The proletarian divisions built up in this
      manner are more compact; they are disciplined by the very method of
      production; and there is, therefore, the less need for a discipline
      imposed from above.</P>
    
    <P>The formation of a sturdy, class-conscious proletarian nucleus is of
      primary importance to the Red Army. In such a country as Russia, in which
      peasants constitute the enormous majority of the population, the
      dictatorship of the proletariat necessarily means that the proletarian
      minority shall lead and organize the peasant majority (the middle
      peasantry); and that the peasant majority shall follow the lead of the
      organizing proletariat, and shall have complete confidence in the
      political wisdom and constructive capacity of the urban workers. This
      statement is fully applicable to the Red Army, which is strong and
      disciplined precisely in proportion as its skeletal framework is
      proletarian and communist. To assemble this skeletal material, to
      distribute it properly, and to clothe the framework with a sufficient
      quantity of the disintegrated but far more abundant peasant material-this
      constitutes the fundamental organizatory task of the Communist Party in
      the upbuilding of the Red Army.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="067"></A>§ 67. The officers of the Red Army</H4>
    
    <P>The upbuilding of the Red Army was begun upon the ruins of the old
      tsarist army. The proletariat, when it gained the victory in the November
      revolution, had not a Red officers' corps of its own. There were only
      three ways in which the workers could make effective use of the
      experiences of the world war, could apply them to the civil war, could
      apply to the military training of its own army the technical military
      experiences that has been accumulated in the fallen régime. The
      first possibility was to create entirely new staffs out of the Reds, and
      to use members of the old officers' caste only as instructors. A second
      way would have been to hand over the command of the new army to the
      officers of the old army under the supervision of commissars. A third
      possible course was a combination of these two methods. Time pressed; the
      civil war had begun; the new army must be quickly created, and must be
      sent to the fight without delay. The proletarian authorities, therefore,
      had to adopt the third method. They began to organize schools for Red
      officers, who in general were only fitted for the lower grades. In
      addition, quite a number of the officers of the old army were invited to
      participate in the upbuilding of the Red Army and to share in its command.</P>
    
    <P>The utilization of the officers of the old army involved difficulties
      which were numerous and grave, and which have not yet been overcome. These
      officers could be divided into three groups, two small and one large. Some
      were more or less strongly sympathetic towards the Soviet Power. Others
      were definitely opposed to the new régime; they sided with the
      class enemies of the proletariat, and have continued to give these enemies
      active assistance. The third group, larger than both the others put
      together, consisted of the average officers who inclined to the winning
      side, and who were willing to serve the Soviet Government just as the wage
      worker serves the capitalist who buys labour power. Now the Communist
      Party had obviously to make all possible use of the services of the
      sympathetic minority. As regards the other minority, every means of
      repression had to be employed to render these reactionaries harmless.
      Finally, as far as the average officers were concerned, those whose
      political attitude in the civil war was neutral, the proletariat had to
      retain them in its service, and to ensure that they did their work
      conscientiously whether at the front or at the rear.</P>
    
    <P>The utilization of the old officers gave valuable results in the
      upbuilding of the Red Army. In this matter we were able to turn to useful
      account the technical experience in military affairs that had been
      acquired by the bourgeois and landlord régime. Their utilization,
      however, entailed terrible dangers, for it occasionally involved
      widespread treachery on the part of the officers, and enormous sacrifices
      of the Red soldiers, who were betrayed and handed over in masses to the
      enemy.</P>
    
    <P>The principal task of the Communist Party in this connexion is, in the
      first place, the effective training of our own commanders for the Red Army
      - the training of Red officers, of communists who shall befitted for work
      on the general staff by a course of training at the Red Academy which has
      been established by the Soviet Power. Secondly we have to ensure a closer
      association between the communist commissars and all the other members of
      the party in the fighting forces, for the effective supervision and
      control of all the non-communist officers.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="068"></A>§ 68. Should army officers be elected, or should
    they be appointed from above?</H4>
    
    <P>The army of the capitalist State, based upon universal military service,
      is mainly composed of peasants and workers, under the command of officers
      drawn from the nobility and the bourgeoisie. When in our old programme we
      demanded the election of officers, our aim was to ensure that the army
      command should be taken out of the hands of the exploiting classes. We
      were assuming that the army might be democratized while political power
      still remained in the hands of the bourgeoisie. Of course the idea was
      utterly unrealizable, for no bourgeoisie in the world could ever be
      expected to hand over without resistance the military apparatus of
      oppression. But in the struggle against militarism, in the campaign
      against the privileges of the officers' caste, our demand for the election
      of officers proved of enormous importance, and it was no less important
      owing to the way in which it contributed to the general disintegration of
      the imperialist armies.</P>
    
    <P>The Red Army, on the other hand, is under proletarian control. The
      workers administer it through the central soviet organs, which they
      themselves elect. In all grades of army life, the proletariat is in
      control through the instrumentality of the communist commissars, who both
      at the front and at the rear are mainly drawn from among the workers. In
      these circumstances, the question of electing officers becomes a question
      of purely technical significance. The matter of real importance is that we
      should know what will make the army, in its present condition, the most
      efficient fighting force. From this point of view, will it be best to
      elect the officers, or to appoint them from above? When we take into
      consideration that our Red Army is mainly recruited from among the
      peasantry, when we recall the hardships to which it is exposed, its
      exhaustion by two wars, and the low level of class consciousness among the
      peasants who have joined the army - it will become obvious to us that the
      practice of electing officers cannot fail to exercise a disintegrating
      influence in our forces. Of course this does not exclude the possibility
      that in different circumstances the election of officers might do no harm;
      for instance, in volunteer units, firmly compacted out of men who all
      possess strong, revolutionary sentiments. Here, election would throw up
      practically the same officers as those who would have been appointed from
      above. As a general rule, however, the election of officers, although it
      may be regarded as an ideal method, would for practical reasons prove
      dangerous and harmful at the present juncture. But by the time the working
      masses who are now enrolled in the Red Army have risen to a level at which
      the election of officers will be useful and necessary, it is probable that
      there will be no further need for armies in the world.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="069"></A>§ 69. The Red Army is provisional</H4>
    
    <P>The bourgeoisie looks upon the capitalist system as the 'natural'
      ordering of human society; it regards its own régime as ever
      lasting, and it therefore constructs the instrument of its power - the
      army - solidly, builds it to last for years and years if not for ever. The
      proletariat regards its own Red Army in quite another light. The Red Army
      has been created by the workers for the struggle with the White Army of
      capital. The Red Army issued out of the civil war; it will disappear when
      a complete victory has been gained in that war, when class has been
      abolished, when the dictatorship of the proletariat has spontaneously
      lapsed. The bourgeois army is born of bourgeois society, and the
      bourgeoisie wishes this child to live for ever because it reflects the
      imperishability of the bourgeois régime. The Red Army, on the other
      hand, is the child of the working class, and the workers desire for their
      child a natural and glorious death. The day when the Red Army can be
      permanently disbanded will be the day on which will be signalized the
      final victory of the communist system.</P>
    
    <P>The Communist Party must make it clear to the soldiers of the Red Army
      that if that army should gain the victory over the White Guards of capital
      the victors would be the soldiers of the last army in the world. But the
      party must also make it perfectly clear to all who participate in the
      upbuilding of the Red Army, it must convince all the proletarian and
      peasant troops, that the workers have only become soldiers for a brief
      space and owing to a temporary need, that the field of <I>production</I>
      is the natural field for their activities, that work in the Red Army must
      on no account lead to the formation of any caste permanently withdrawn
      from industry and agriculture.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">When the formation of the Red Army was first begun, the
      formation of the army which sprang from the proletarian Red Guards, the
      mensheviks and the social revolutionaries fiercely attacked the
      communists, declaring that the latter were false to the watchword of the
      general arming of the people, and accusing them of creating a standing
      army consisting of only one class. But the fact that civil war cannot last
      for ever, makes it obvious that the Red Army cannot be a standing army.
      The real reason why our army is a class army is because the class struggle
      has reached the last extremity of bitterness. No one but a pettybourgeois
      utopist, no one who is not hopelessly stupid, can object to the existence
      of a class army while recognizing the class war. It is characteristic that
      the bourgeoisie, in this epoch which has ensued upon the settlement of the
      world war, no longer thinks it necessary, or even possible, to conceal the
      class character of its army. Most instructive, in this connexion, has been
      the fate of the standing army in Germany, Britain, and France. The German
      National Assembly was elected by universal suffrage. Its main support was
      Noske's force of volunteer counter-revolutionary troops. At the stage of
      the embitterment of the class struggle and at the stage of the decay of
      bourgeois society which Germany has now reached, it is impossible that an
      army based on universal military service can be used for the maintenance
      of bourgeois institutions. Similarly in France and Britain, during the
      year 1919 the government was mainly dependent upon the support, not of the
      army which had been raised by universal service and had gained the victory
      in the great war, but upon a voluntary force of counter-revolutionary
      soldiers and police. Thus, not merely in Russia from the close of 1917,
      but likewise all over Europe from the close of 1918, a characteristic
      phenomenon was the abandonment of universal military service and the
      adoption of a system of class armies. In Russia, the traitors to socialism
      - the mensheviks and the social revolutionaries - were strongly opposed to
      the formation of the Red Army of the proletariat, at the very time when in
      Central Europe their friends Noske and Scheidermann were organizing the
      White Army of the bourgeoisie. Thus the struggle against the creation of
      the class army of the proletariat (a struggle conducted in the name of
      universal military service and in the name of 'democracy') showed itself
      in practice to be a struggle to found the class army of the bourgeoisie.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Passing now to consider the question of a national
      militia, we find that the example of Switzerland, the example of the most
      democratic of all the bourgeois republics, has shown the part which such a
      militia plays in the hour when the class struggle is accentuated. The
      national militia, the 'people's militia', of Switzerland under a bourgeois
      régime proves to be precisely the same weapon for keeping the
      proletariat down as any standing army in less democratic lands. The arming
      of the whole nation will inevitably lead to this result whenever and
      wherever it is effected under the political and economic régime of
      capitalism.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>THE COMMUNIST PARTY DOES NOT ADVOCATE THE UNIVERSAL ARMING OF THE
      PEOPLE, BUT THE UNIVERSAL ARMING OF THE WORKERS. ONLY IN A SOCIETY
      CONSISTING OF NONE BUT WORKERS, ONLY IN A CLASSLESS SOCIETY, WILL IT BE
      POSSIBLE TO ARM THE WHOLE PEOPLE.</P>

      We are speaking in the text of an army in the full sense of the term. If
      we are asked where the first beginnings of such a Red Army are to be
      found, we can point to the army of the Paris Commune as the precursor of
      our Red Army - to the army which the workers of Paris created in the year
      1871.</P>
