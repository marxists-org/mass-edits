    <H3>Chapter 11: Communism and Religion</H3>
    
    <H4><A NAME="089"></A>§ 89. Why religion and communism are
    incompatible</H4>
    
    <P>'Religion is the opium of the people,' said Karl Marx. It is the task of
      the Communist Party to make this truth comprehensible to the widest
      possible circles of the labouring masses. It is the task of the party to
      impress firmly upon the minds of the workers, even upon the most backward,
      that religion has been in the past and still is today one of the most
      powerful means at the disposal of the oppressors for the maintenance of
      inequality, exploitation, and slavish obedience on the part of the
      toilers.</P>
    
    <P>Many weak-kneed communists reason as follows: 'Religion does not prevent
      my being a communist. I believe both in God and in communism. My faith in
      God does not hinder me from fighting for the cause of the proletarian
      revolution.'</P>
    
    <P>This train of thought is radically false. Religion and communism are
      incompatible, both theoretically and practically.</P>
    
    <P>Every communist must regard social phenomena (the relationships between
      human beings, revolutions, wars, etc.) as processes which occur in
      accordance with definite laws. The laws of social development have been
      fully established by scientific communism on the basis of the theory of
      historical materialism which we owe to our great teachers Karl Marx and
      Friedrich Engels. This theory explains that social development is not
      brought about by any kind of supernatural forces. Nay more. The same
      theory has demonstrated that the very idea of God and of supernatural
      powers arises at a definite stage in human history, and at another
      definite stage begins to disappear as a childish notion which finds no
      confirmation in practical life and in the struggle between man and nature.
      But it is profitable to the predatory class to maintain the ignorance of
      the people and to maintain the people's childish belief in miracles (the
      key to the riddle really lies in the exploiters' pockets), and this is why
      religious prejudices are so tenacious, and why they confuse the minds even
      of persons who are in other respects able.</P>
    
    <P>The general happenings throughout nature are, moreover, in no wise
      dependent upon supernatural causes. Man has been extremely successful in
      the struggle with nature. He influences nature in his own interests, and
      controls natural forces, achieving these conquests, not thanks to his
      faith in God and in divine assistance, but in spite of this faith. He
      achieves his conquests thanks to the fact that in practical life and in
      all serious matters he invariably conducts himself as an atheist.
      Scientific communism, in its judgements concerning natural phenomena, is
      guided by the data of the natural sciences, which are in irreconcilable
      conflict with all religious imaginings.</P>
    
    <P>In practice, no less than in theory, communism is incompatible with
      religious faith. The tactic of the Communist Party prescribes for the
      members of the party definite lines of conduct. The moral code of every
      religion in like manner prescribes for the faithful some definite line of
      conduct. For example, the Christian code runs: 'Whosoever shall smite thee
      on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.' In most cases there is an
      irreconcilable conflict between the principles of communist tactics and
      the commandments of religion. A communist who rejects the commandments of
      religion and acts in accordance with the directions of the party, ceases
      to be one of the faithful. On the other hand, one who, while calling
      himself a communist, continues to cling to his religious faith, one who in
      the name of religious commandments infringes the prescriptions of the
      party, ceases thereby to be a communist.</P>
    
    <P>The struggle with religion has two sides, and every communist must
      distinguish clearly between them. On the one hand we have the struggle
      with the church, as a special organization existing for religious
      propaganda, materially interested in the maintenance of popular ignorance
      and religious enslavement. On the other hand we have the struggle with the
      widely diffused and deeply ingrained prejudices of the majority of the
      working population.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="090"></A>§ 90. Separation of the church from the state</H4>
    
    <P>The Christian catechism teaches that the church is a society of the
      faithful who are united by a common creed, by the sacraments, etc. For the
      communist, the church is a society of persons who are united by definite
      sources of income at the cost of the faithful, at the cost of their
      ignorance and lack of true culture. It is a society united with the
      society of other exploiters such as the landlords and the capitalists,
      united with their State, assisting that State in the oppression of the
      workers, and reciprocally receiving from the State help in the business of
      oppression. The union between church and State is of great antiquity. The
      association between the church and the feudalist State of the landowners
      was exceedingly intimate. This becomes clear when we remember that the
      autocratic-aristocratic State was sustained by the landed interest. The
      church was itself a landlord on the grand scale, owning millions upon
      millions of acres. These two powers were inevitably compelled to join
      forces against the labouring masses, and their alliance served to
      strengthen their dominion over the workers. During the period in which the
      urban bourgeoisie was in conflict with the feudal nobility, the
      bourgeoisie fiercely attacked the church, because the church owned
      territories which the bourgeoisie wanted for itself. The church, as
      landowner, was in receipt of revenues extracted from the workers -
      revenues which the bourgeoisie coveted. In some countries (France for
      instance), the struggle was extremely embittered; in other countries
      (England, Germany, and Russia), it was less fierce. But this conflict
      explains why the demand for the separation of church and State was made by
      the liberal bourgeoisie and the bourgeois democracy. The real basis of the
      demand was a desire for the transfer to the bourgeoisie of the revenues
      allotted by the State to the church. But the demand for the separation of
      the church from the State was nowhere fully realized by the bourgeoisie.
      The reason is that everywhere the struggle carried on by the working class
      against the capitalists was growing more intense, and it seemed
      inexpedient to the bourgeoisie to break up the alliance between State and
      church. The capitalists thought it would be more advantageous to come to
      terms with the church, to buy its prayers on behalf of the struggle with
      socialism, to utilize its influence over the uncultured masses in order to
      keep alive in their minds the sentiment of slavish submissiveness to the
      exploiting State. ('All power comes from God.')</P>
    
    <P>The work which the bourgeoisie in its struggle with the church had left
      unfinished was carried to an end by the proletarian State. One of the
      first decrees of the Soviet Power in Russia was the decree concerning the
      separation of the church from the State. All its landed estates were taken
      away from the church and handed over to the working population. All the
      capital of the church became the property of the workers. The endowments
      which had been assigned to the church under the tsarist régime were
      confiscated, although these endowments had been cheerfully continued under
      the administration of the 'socialist' Kerensky. Religion has become the
      private affair of every citizen. The Soviet Power rejects all thoughts of
      using the church in any way whatever as a means for strengthening the
      proletarian State.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="091"></A>§ 91. Separation of the school from the church</H4>
    
    <P>The association of religious propaganda with scholastic instruction is
      the second powerful weapon employed by the clergy for the strengthening of
      the ecclesiastical régime and for increasing the influence of the
      church over the masses. The future of the human race, its youth, is
      entrusted to the priests. Under the tsars, the maintenance of religious
      fanaticism, the maintenance of stupidity and ignorance, was regarded as a
      matter of great importance to the State. Religion was the leading subject
      of instruction in the schools. In the schools, moreover, the autocracy
      supported the church, and the church supported the autocracy. In addition
      to compulsory religious teaching in the schools and compulsory attendance
      at religious services, the church had other weapons. It began to take
      charge of the whole of popular education, and for this purpose Russia was
      covered with a network of church schools.</P>
    
    <P>Thanks to the union of school and church, our young people were from
      their earliest years thralls to religious superstition, this making it
      practically impossible to convey to their minds any integral outlook upon
      the universe. To one and the same question (for instance concerning the
      origin of the world) religion and science give conflicting answers, so
      that the impressionable mind of the pupil becomes a battle ground between
      exact knowledge and the gross errors of obscurantists.</P>
    
    <P>In many countries, young people are trained, not only in a spirit of
      submissiveness towards the dominant régime, but also in a spirit of
      submissiveness towards the overthrown autocratic, ecclesiastico-feudal
      order. This happens in France. Even from the outlook of the bourgeois
      State, propaganda of such a kind is reactionary.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The programme of bourgeois liberalism used to contain a
      demand for the separation of the school from the church. The liberals
      fought for the replacement of religious instruction in the schools by
      instruction in bourgeois morality; and they demanded the closing of
      schools organized by religious associations and by monasteries. Nowhere,
      however, was this struggle carried through to an end. In France, for
      instance, where for two decades all the bourgeois ministries had solemnly
      pledged themselves to dissolve the religious orders, to confiscate their
      property, and to forbid their educational activities, there has been one
      compromise after another with the Catholic clergy. An excellent example of
      such a compromise between State and church was the recent action of
      Clemenceau. This minister in his day had been fiercely opposed to the
      church. In the end, however, he forgot his hostility, and personally
      distributed orders of distinction among the Catholic clergy as a reward
      for their patriotic services. In the struggle for the exploitation of
      other lands (the war with Germany), and in the domestic struggle with the
      working class, the bourgeois State and the church have entered into an
      alliance, and give one another mutual support.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This reconciliation of the bourgeoisie with the church
      finds expression, not merely in the abandonment by the bourgeoisie of its
      old anti-religious watchwords and of its campaign against religion, but in
      something more significant. To an increasing extent, the bourgeoisie is
      now becoming a 'believing class'. The forerunners of the contemporary
      European bourgeoisie were atheists, were freethinkers, were fiercely
      antagonistic to priests and priestdom. Their successors have taken a step
      back- wards. A generation ago, the bourgeois, though they were them-
      selves still atheistically inclined, though they did not believe in
      religious fairy tales, and though they laughed covertly at religion,
      nevertheless considered that the fables must be treated with respect in
      public, since religion was a useful restraint for the common people.
      Today, the scions of the bourgeoisie are not content with looking upon
      religion as providing useful fetters for the people, but they have
      themselves begun to wear the chains. Under our very eyes, after the
      November revolution, the liberal bourgeois and the members of the
      professional classes crowded into the churches and prayed fervently to
      that which in happier days they had regarded with contempt. Such is the
      fate of all dying classes, whose last resource it is to seek 'consolation'
      in religion.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Among the bourgeoisies of Central and Western Europe,
      which still hold the reins of power, a similar movement in favour of
      religion is observable. But if the bourgeois class begins to believe in
      God and the heavenly life, this merely means it has realized that its life
      here below is drawing to a close!</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The separation of the school from the church aroused and continues to
      arouse protest from the backward elements among the workers and peasants.
      Many of the older generation persist in demanding that religion should
      still be taught in the schools as an optional subject. The Communist Party
      fights resolutely against all such attempts to turn back. The teaching of
      ecclesias- tical obscurantism in the schools, even though the instruction
      should be merely optional, would imply the giving of State aid to the
      maintenance of religious prejudices. In that case the church would be
      provided with a ready-made audience of children - of children who are
      assembled in school for purposes which are the very opposite of those
      contemplated by religion. The church would have at its disposal
      schoolrooms belonging to the State, and would thereby be enabled to
      diffuse religious poison among our young people almost as freely as it
      could before the separation of the school from the church.</P>
    
    <P>The decree whereby the school is separated from the church must be
      rigidly enforced, and the proletarian State must not make the slightest
      concession to medievalism. What has already been done to throw off the
      yoke of religion is all too little, for it still remains within the power
      of ignorant parents to cripple the minds of their children by teaching
      them religious fables. Under the Soviet Power there is freedom of
      conscience for adults. But this freedom of conscience for parents is
      tantamount to a freedom for them to poison the minds of their children
      with the opium which when they were young was poured into their own minds
      by the church. The parents force upon the children their own dullness,
      their own ignorance; they proclaim as truth all sorts of nonsense; and
      they thus greatly increase the difficulties which the unified labour
      school has to encounter. One of the most important tasks of the
      proletarian State is to liberate children from the reactionary influence
      exercised by their parents. The really radical way of doing this is the
      social education of the children, carried to its logical conclusion. As
      far as the immediate future is concerned, we must not rest content with
      the expulsion of religious propaganda from the school. We must see to it
      that the school assumes the offensive against religious propaganda in the
      home, so that from the very outset the children's minds shall be rendered
      immune to all those religious fairy tales which many grown-ups continue to
      regard as truth.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="092"></A>§ 92. Struggle with the religious prejudice of
    the masses</H4>
    
    <P>It has been comparatively easy for the proletarian authority to effect
      the separation of the church from the State and of the school from the
      church, and these changes have been almost painlessly achieved. It is
      enormously more difficult to fight the religious prejudices which are
      already deeply rooted in the consciousness of the masses, and which cling
      so stubbornly to life. The struggle will be a long one, demanding much
      steadfastness and great patience. Upon this matter we read in our
      programme: 'The Russian Communist Party is guided by the conviction that
      nothing but the realization of purposiveness and full awareness in all the
      social and economic activities of the masses can lead to the complete
      disappearance of religious prejudices.' What do these words signify?</P>
    
    <P>Religious propaganda, belief in God and in all kinds of supernatural
      powers, find their most grateful soil where the institutions of social
      life are such as to incline the consciousness of the masses towards
      supernatural explanations of the phenomena of nature and society. The
      environment created by capitalist methods of production has a strong
      tendency in this direction. In capitalist society, production, and the
      exchange of products, are not effected with full consciousness and in
      accordance with a preconceived plan; they proceed as if they were the
      outcome of elemental forces. The market controls the producer. No one
      knows whether commodities are being produced in excess or in deficiency.
      The producer does not fully understand how the great and complicated
      mechanism of capitalist production works; why crises occur and
      unemployment suddenly becomes rife; why prices rise at one time and fall
      at another; and so on. The ordinary worker, knowing nothing of the real
      causes of the social happenings amid which his life takes place, readily
      inclines to accept the 'will of God' as a universal explanation.</P>
    
    <P>In organized communist society, on the other hand, the realms of
      production and distribution will no longer contain any mysteries for the
      worker. Every worker will not merely perform his allotted portion of
      social work. He will in addition participate in the elaboration of the
      general plan of production, and will at least have clear ideas upon the
      matter. Throughout the entire mechanism of social production there will no
      longer be anything mysterious, incomprehensible, or unexpected, and there
      will therefore be no further place for mystical explanations or for
      superstition. Just as the joiner who has made a table knows perfectly well
      how the table came to exist and that he need not lift his eyes towards
      heaven in order to find its creator, so in communist society all the
      workers will clearly understand what they have produced with their
      collective energies and how they have produced it.</P>
    
    <P>For this reason, the mere fact of the organization and strengthening of
      the socialist system, will deal religion an irrecoverable blow. THE
      TRANSITION FROM SOCIALISM TO COMMUNISM, THE TRANSITION FROM THE SOCIETY
      WHICH MAKES AN END OF CAPITALISM TO THE SOCIETY WHICH IS COMPLETELY FREED
      FROM ALL TRACES OF CLASS DIVISION AND CLASS STRUGGLE, WILL BRING ABOUT THE
      NATURAL DEATH OF ALL RELIGION AND ALL SUPERSTITION.</P>
    
    <P>But this must by no means be taken to imply that we can sit down at our
      ease, satisfied with having prophesied the decay of religion at some
      future date.</P>
    
    <P>It is essential at the present time to wage with the utmost vigour the
      war against religious prejudices, for the church has now definitely become
      a counter-revolutionary organization, and endeavours to use its religious
      influence over the masses in order to marshal them for the political
      struggle against the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Orthodox faith
      which is defended by the priests aims at an alliance with the monarchy.
      This is why the Soviet Power finds it necessary to engage at this juncture
      in widespread anti-religious propaganda. Our aims can be secured by the
      delivery of special lectures, by the holding of debates, and by the
      publication of suitable literature; also by the general diffusion of
      scientific knowledge, which slowly but surely undermines the authority of
      religion. An excellent weapon in the fight with the church was used
      recently in many parts of the republic when the shrines were opened to
      show the 'incorruptible' relics. This served to prove to the wide masses
      of the people, and precisely to those in whom religious faith was
      strongest, the base trickery upon which religion in general, and the creed
      of the Russian Orthodox church in particular, are grounded.</P>
    
    <P>But the campaign against the backwardness of the masses in this matter
      of religion, must be conducted with patience and considerateness, as well
      as with energy and perseverance. The credulous crowd is extremely
      sensitive to anything which hurts its feelings. To thrust atheism upon the
      masses, and in conjunction therewith to interfere forcibly with religious
      practices and to make mock of the objects of popular reverence, would not
      assist but would hinder the campaign against religion. If the church were
      to be persecuted, it would win sympathy among the masses, for persecution
      would remind them of the almost forgotten days when there was an
      association between religion and the defence of national freedom; it would
      strengthen the antisemitic movement; and in general it would mobilize all
      the vestiges of an ideology which is already beginning to die out.</P>
    
    <P>We propose to append a few figures, showing how the tsarist régime
      paid over the people's money to the church; how the church was directly
      supported by the common people, who drained their slender purses to this
      end; and how wealth accumulated in the hands of the servants of Christ.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Through the synods and in other ways the tsarist
      government annually supplied the church with the average amount of
      50,000,000 roubles (at a time when the rouble was worth one hundred times
      as much as today). The synods had 70,000,000 roubles to their credit in
      the banks. The churches and the monasteries owned vast areas of land. In
      the year 7905 the churches owned 1,872,000 desyatinas, and the monasteries
      owned 740,000 desyatinas. Six of the largest monasteries owned 782,000
      desyatinas. The Solovyetsky monastery owned 66,000 desyatinas; the
      Sarovskaya, 26,000; the Alexandro-Nevskaya, 25,000; and so on. In 7903,
      the churches and monasteries of Petrograd owned 266 rent-producing
      properties in the form of houses, shops, building sites, etc. In Moscow,
      they owned 1,054 rent-paying houses, not to mention 32 hotels. In Kiev,
      the churches owned 114 houses. Here are the stipends of the metropolitans
      and the archbishops. The metropolitan of Petrograd received 300,000
      roubles per annum; the metropolitans of Moscow and of Kiev were paid
      100,000 roubles per annum each; the stipend of the archbishop of Novgorod
      was 370,000 roubles.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">There were about 30,000 church schools, and these were
      attended by 1,000,000 pupils. More than 20,000 teachers of religion were
      'at work' in the elementary schools of the Ministry for Education.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Everyone knows that the autocracy supported the
      Orthodox church as the dominant and only true church. Many millions of
      roubles were raised by taxing Musulmans (Tartars and Bashkirs), Catholics
      (Poles), and Jews. This money was used by the Orthodox clergy to
      demonstrate that all other faiths were false. Under the tsarist régime,
      religious persecution attained unprecedented proportions. In the
      population of Russia, for every hundred inhabitants there were (besides
      the 70 Orthodox), 9 Catholics, 11 Mohammedans, 9 Protestants, 4 Jews, and
      7 of various creeds. As for the number of the Orthodox clergy, the
      following were the figures for the year 1909:</FONT></P>

    <P>The figures relate exclusively to the Orthodox church. A similar
      parasitic caste is found in every nation, though of course, professing
      some other religion. These masses of people, instead of extracting vast
      sums of money from the population in order to promote popular ignorance,
      would have been able, had they been engaged in manual work, to produce
      immense quantities of values. The socialist State, when its economic
      apparatus has been perfected, will introduce labour service for the clergy
      as for all unproductive classes, so that they will have to become workers
      or peasants. Of the State revenues paid to the church under the tsarist régime,
      more than 12,000,000 roubles went every year to the urban and rural
      clergy. It is plain enough why the reverend fathers were opposed to the
      separation of the church from the State, since this implied the separation
      of a dozen million roubles from their pockets. This sum, however, was but
      a fraction of the clerical incomes, which for the most part were derived
      from professional fees, land rents, and interest upon the capital of the
      church. No one has been able to ascertain the precise amount of the
      revenues of the Russian church. Approximately the sum may be considered to
      have been 150,000,000 roubles - at a time (we repeat) when the rouble was
      worth one hundred of our present roubles. A considerable proportion of
      this income is still paid by the people to the clergy.</P>
