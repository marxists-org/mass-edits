    <H3>Chapter 10: Communism and Education</H3>
    
    <H4><A NAME="076"></A>§ 76. The school under the bourgeois regime</H4>
    
    <P>In bourgeois society the school has three principal tasks to fulfil.
      First, it inspires the coming generation of workers with devotion and
      respect for the capitalist régime. Secondly, it creates from the
      young of the ruling classes 'cultured' controllers of the working
      population. Thirdly, it assists capitalist production in the application
      of sciences to technique, thus increasing capitalist profits.</P>
    
    <P>As regards the first of these tasks, just as in the bourgeois army the
      'right spirit' is inculcated by the officers, so in the schools under the
      capitalist régime the necessary influence is mainly exercised by
      the caste of 'officers of popular enlightenment'. The teachers in the
      public elementary schools receive a special course of training by which
      they are prepared for their role of beast tamers. Only persons who have
      thoroughly acquired the bourgeois outlook have the entry into the schools
      as teachers. The ministries of education in the capitalist régime
      are ever on the watch, and they ruthlessly purge the teaching profession
      of all dangerous (by which they mean socialist) elements. The German
      public elementary schools served prior to the revolution as supplements to
      the barracks of William II, and were shining examples of the way in which
      the landed gentry and the bourgeoisie can make use of the school for the
      manufacture of faithful and blind slaves of capital. In the elementary
      schools of the capitalist régime, instruction is given in
      accordance with a definite programme perfectly adapted for the breaking-in
      of the pupils to the capitalist system. All the text-books are written in
      an appropriate spirit. The whole of bourgeois literature subserves the
      same end, for it is written by persons who look upon the bourgeois social
      order as natural, perdurable, and the best of all possible régimes.
      In this way the scholars are imperceptibly stuffed with bourgeois
      ideology; they are infected with enthusiasm for all bourgeois virtues;
      they are inspired with esteem for wealth, renown, titles and order; they
      aspire to get on in the world, they long for personal comfort, and so on.
      The work of bourgeois educationists is completed by the servants of the
      church with their religious instruction. Thanks to the intimate
      associations between capital and the church, the law of God invariably
      proves to be the law of the possessing classes.
	  <SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P>In capitalist society the second leading aim of bourgeois education is
      secured by carefully withholding secondary education and higher education
      from the working masses. Instruction in the middle schools, and still more
      in the high schools, is extremely costly, so that it is quite beyond the
      financial resources of the workers. The course of instruction, in middle
      and higher education, lasts for ten years or more. For this reason it is
      inaccessible to the worker and the peasant who, in order to feed their
      families, are compelled to send their children at a very early age to
      factory work or field work, or else must make the youngsters work at home.
      In actual practice, the middle and higher schools are the preserves of
      bourgeois youth. In them, the younger members of the governing classes are
      trained to succeed their fathers in careers of exploitation, or to fill
      the official and technical posts of the capitalist State. In these
      schools, likewise, instruction has a definitely class character. In the
      domains of mathematics, the technique of industry, and the natural
      sciences, this may be less striking; but the class character of the
      teaching is conspicuous in the case of the social sciences, whereby the
      pupils' outlook on the world is in reality formed. Bourgeois political
      economy is inculcated with all the most perfected methods for the
      'annihilation of Marx'. Sociology and history are likewise taught from a
      purely capitalist outlook. The history of jurisprudence concludes with the
      treatment of bourgeois jurisprudence as the natural right of 'the man and
      the citizen', etc., etc. To sum up, the higher and middle schools teach
      the children of the capitalists all the data that are requisite for the
      maintenance of bourgeois society and the whole system of capitalist
      exploitation. If any of the children of the workers, happening to be
      exceptionally gifted, should find their way into the higher schools, in
      the great majority of instances the bourgeois scholastic apparatus will
      serve as a means of detaching them from their own class kin, and will
      inoculate them with bourgeois ideology, so that in the long run the genius
      of these scions of the working class will be turned to account for the
      oppression of the workers.</P>
    
    <P>Turning, finally, to the third task of capitalist education, we find
      that the school fulfils it as follows. In a class society where capitalism
      is dominant, science is divorced from labour. Not only does it become the
      property of the possessing classes. More than this, it becomes the
      profession of a small and comparatively narrow circle of individuals.
      Scientific instruction and scientific research are divorced from the
      labour process. In order that it may avail itself of the data of science
      and may turn them to account in production, bourgeois society has to
      create a number of institutions serving for the application of scientific
      discoveries to manufacturing technique; and it has to create a number of
      technical schools which will facilitate the maintenance of production at
      the level rendered possible by the advance of 'pure' science - by which is
      meant science divorced from labour. Furthermore, the polytechnic schools
      of capitalist society do not merely serve to supply capitalist society
      with technical experts; they supply in addition those who will act as
      managers, those who will function as 'captains of industry'. In addition,
      to provide the personnel which will supervise the circulation of
      commodities, there have been founded numerous commercial schools and
      academies.</P>
    
    <P>In all these organizations, whatever is linked up with production will
      endure. But everything which is concerned merely with <I>capitalist</I>
      production, will die out. There will persist everything which promotes the
      advancement of science; there will perish that which promotes the
      severance of science from labour. There will be preserved the methods of
      technical instruction - but instruction in technical methods altogether
      apart from the performance of physical labour will be abolished. There
      will be preserved and extended the utilization of science to further
      production. On the other hand, any hindrances to such utilization of
      science, in so far as capital tends to make use of science only to the
      degree in which at any given moment science tends to raise profits, will
      be swept out of the way.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="077"></A>§ 77. The destructive tasks of communism</H4>
    
    <P>In the matter of education, as in all other matters, the Communist Party
      is not merely faced by constructive tasks, for in the opening phases of
      its activity it is likewise faced by destructive tasks. In the educational
      system bequeathed to it by capitalist society, it must hasten to destroy
      everything which has made of the school an instrument of capitalist class
      rule.</P>
    
    <P>In capitalist society, the higher stages of school life were the
      exclusive property of the exploiting classes. Such schools, in their
      unending series of higher classical schools, higher modern schools,
      institutes, cadet corps, etc., have to be destroyed.</P>
    
    <P>The teaching staff of the bourgeois schools served the purposes of
      bourgeois culture and of fraud. We must ruthlessly expel from the
      proletarian school all those teachers of the old schools who either cannot
      or will not become instruments for the communist enlightenment of the
      masses.</P>
    
    <P>In the schools of the old régime, teachers were engaged who had
      been indoctrinated with the bourgeois spirit; in these schools methods of
      instruction were practised which served the class interests of the
      bourgeoisie. In our new schools, we must make a clean sweep of all such
      things.</P>
    
    <P>The old school was intimately associated with religion - by compulsory
      religious teaching, compulsory attendance at prayers, and compulsory
      church-going. The new school forcibly expels religion from within its
      walls, under whatever guise it seeks entry and in whatever diluted form
      reactionary groups of parents may desire to drag it back again.</P>
    
    <P>The old university created a close corporation of professors, a
      teachers' guild, which prevented the introduction of fresh teaching
      strength into the university. The close corporation of bourgeois
      professors must be dissolved, and the professorial chairs must be thrown
      open to all competent instructors.</P>
    
    <P>Under the tsar, Russian was the only permissible language in the State
      service and in the school; the non-Russian subjects of the tsar were not
      allowed to receive instruction in their native tongue. In the new schools,
      all trace of national oppression disappears from the realm of instruction,
      for those of every nationality are entitled to receive education in their
      respective tongues.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="078"></A>§ 78. The school as an instrument of communist
    education and enlightenment</H4>
    
    <P>The bourgeoisie comprises a very small minority of the population. This,
      however, does not prevent it from supplementing the other instruments of
      class oppression by the use of the school to educate and break in the
      millions of workers, to inoculate them with bourgeois ideology. In this
      way the majority of the population is constrained to accept the outlook
      and the morality of a numerically insignificant fraction.</P>
    
    <P>In capitalist countries, the proletariat and the semi-proletariat
      comprise the majority of the population. In Russia, the urban workers,
      though a minority, have in political matters become the leaders and the
      organizers of the struggle on behalf of all the toilers. It is natural,
      therefore, that the urban proletariat, having seized power, should use it
      primarily to this end, that it may raise all the backward strata of the
      working population to the requisite level of communist consciousness. The
      bourgeoisie used the school for the enslavement of all who live by labour.
      The proletariat will use the school to enfranchise them, to sweep away the
      last traces of spiritual slavery from the consciousness of the workers.
      Thanks to the schools, the bourgeoisie was able to impose upon proletarian
      children a bourgeois mentality. The task of the new communist schools is
      to impose upon bourgeois and petty-bourgeois children a proletarian
      mentality. In the realm of the mind, in the psychological sphere, the
      communist school must effect the same revolutionary overthrow of bourgeois
      society, must effect the same expropriation, that the Soviet Power has
      effected in the economic sphere by the nationalization of the means of
      production. The minds of men must be made ready for the new social
      relationships. If the masses find it difficult to construct a communist
      society, this is because in many departments of mental life they still
      have both feet firmly planted upon the soil of bourgeois society, because
      they have not yet freed themselves from bourgeois prejudices. In part,
      therefore, it is the task of the new school to adapt the mentality of
      adults to the changed social conditions. Still more, however, it is the
      task of the new school to train up a younger generation whose whole
      ideology shall be deeply rooted in the soil of the new communist society.</P>
    
    <P>The attainment of this end must be promoted by all our educational
      reforms, some of which have already been inaugurated, whilst others still
      await realization.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="079"></A>§ 79. Preparation for school life</H4>
    
    <P>In bourgeois society, the child is regarded as the property of its
      parents - if not wholly, at least to a major degree. When parents say, 'My
      daughter', 'My son', the words do not simply imply the existence of a
      parental relationship, they also give expression to the parents' view that
      they have a right to educate their own children. From the socialist
      outlook, no such right exists. The individual human being does not belong
      to himself, but to society, to the human race. The individual can only
      live and thrive owing to the existence of society. The child, therefore,
      belongs to the society in which it lives, and thanks to which it came into
      being - and this society is something wider than the 'society' of its own
      parents. To society, likewise, belongs the primary and basic right of
      educating children. From this point of view, the parents' claim to bring
      up their own children and thereby to impress upon the children's
      psychology their own limitations, must not merely be rejected, but must be
      absolutely laughed out of court. Society may entrust the education of
      children to the parents; but it may refuse to do anything of the kind; and
      there is all the more reason why society should refuse to entrust
      education to the parents, seeing that the faculty of educating children is
      far more rarely encountered than the faculty of begetting them. Of one
      hundred mothers, we shall perhaps find one or two who are competent
      educators. The future belongs to social education. Social education will
      make it possible for socialist society to train the coming generation most
      successfully, at lowest cost, and with the least expenditure of energy.</P>
    
    <P>The social education of children, therefore, must be realized for other
      reasons besides those of pedagogy. It has enormous economic advantages.
      Hundreds of thousands, millions of mothers will thereby be freed for
      productive work and for selfculture. They will be freed from the
      soul-destroying routine of housework, and from the endless round of petty
      duties which are involved in the education of children in their own homes.</P>
    
    <P>That is why the Soviet Power is striving to create a number of
      institutions for the improvement of social education, which are intended
      by degrees to universalize it. To this class of institutions belong the
      kindergartens, to which manual workers, clerks, etc., can send their
      children, thus entrusting them to experts who will prepare the children
      for school life. To this category, too, belong the homes or residential
      kindergartens. There are also children's colonies, where the children
      either live permanently, or for a considerable period, away from their
      parents. There are in addition the crèches, institutions for the
      reception of children under four years of age; in these the little ones
      are cared for while their parents are at work.</P>
    
    <P>The Communist Party, therefore, must, on the one hand, ensure, through
      the working of soviet institutions, that there shall be a more rapid
      development of the places where children are prepared for school life, and
      it must ensure that there shall be a steady improvement in the training
      given at such places. On the other hand, by intensified propaganda among
      parents, the party must overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois prejudices
      concerning the necessity and superiority of home education. Here
      theoretical propaganda must be reinforced by the example of the best
      conducted educational institutions of the Soviet Power. Only too often,
      the unsatisfactory condition of the homes; crèches, kindergartens,
      etc., deters parents from entrusting their children to these. It must be
      the task of the Communist Party, and especially of the women's sections,
      to induce parents to strive for the improvement of social education, not
      by holding aloof from it, but by sending their children to the appropriate
      institutions, and by exercising the widest possible control over them
      through parents' organizations.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="080"></A>§ 80. The unified labour school</H4>
    
    <P>The preparatory institutions are for children up to the age of seven.
      After that age, education and instruction must be effected in the school-
      not in the home. Education must be compulsory, which marks a great advance
      upon tsarist times. It must be gratuitous, and this also marks a great
      advance, for even in the most progressive bourgeois lands only elementary
      education is gratuitous. Education is naturally open to all, for the
      educational and cultural privileges of special groups of the population
      have now been abolished. Universal, equal, and compulsory education is
      made available for all children from the ages of seven to seventeen.</P>
    
    <P>The school must be unified. This means, first of all, that the
      segregation of the sexes in the school must be done away with, that boys
      and girls must be educated together, that there must be co-education.
      Unification further signifies the abolition of the classification of
      schools as elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools, having no
      connexion one with another, and working in accordance with programmes
      which are quite independent of one another. It implies that there must no
      longer be a division of the elementary, middle, and high schools into
      general schools on the one hand and specialist or technical schools on the
      other, or into common schools and schools for special classes of the
      population. The unified school provides a single gradated system, through
      which every learner in the socialist republic can and must pass. Boys and
      girls will begin with kindergarten, and will work their way together
      through all stages to the top. This will conclude general compulsory
      education and also such technical education as is compulsory for every
      pupil.</P>
    
    <P>It will be obvious to our readers that the unified school is not merely
      the ideal of every advanced educationist, but is the only possible type of
      school in a socialist society, that is to say, in a classless society or
      in one that is striving to abolish class. Socialism alone can realize this
      ideal of the unified school, although certain bourgeois educationists have
      entertained aspirations towards it.</P>
    
    <P>The school of the socialist republic must be a labour school. This means
      that instruction and education must be united with labour and must be
      based upon labour. The matter is important for many reasons. It is
      important, first of all because of its bearing upon successful
      instruction. A child learns more easily, more willingly, and more
      thoroughly that which it learns, not from books or from the words of the
      teacher, but from the personal experience of what it is doing with its own
      hands. We can more easily understand our natural surroundings when we get
      to work upon nature in our attempts to modify it. This unification of
      instruction with labour has already begun in the most progressive
      bourgeois schools. It is impossible, however, to carry it out thoroughly
      in the bourgeois system, in which parasitic elements are deliberately
      cultivated, and in which physical work is separated from mental work by an
      impassable gulf.</P>
    
    <P>Labour is necessary, not only for the healthy physical development of
      the children, but also for the proper development of all their faculties.
      Experience shows that the time they spend at school in practical work, far
      from retarding their progress in all kinds of theoretical knowledge,
      contributes greatly to their advance in the theoretical field.</P>
    
    <P>Finally, for communist society, the labour school is absolutely
      indispensable. Every citizen in such a society must be acquainted with the
      elements, at least, of all crafts. In communist society there will be no
      closed corporations, no stereotyped guilds, no petrified specialist
      groups. The most brilliant man of science must also be skilled in manual
      labour. To the pupil who is about to leave the unified labour school,
      communist society says: 'You may or may not become a professor; but in any
      case you must produce values.' A child's first activities take the form of
      play; play should gradually pass into work by an imperceptible transition,
      so that the child learns from the very outset to look upon labour, not as
      a disagreeable necessity or as a punishment, but as a natural and
      spontaneous expression of faculty. Labour should be a need, like the
      desire for food and drink; this need must be instilled, and developed in
      the communist school.</P>
    
    <P>In communist society, with its vigorous technical progress, there will
      inevitably be vast and rapid transferences of labour power from one
      department to another. For example, a discovery in the weaving or the
      spinning industry may reduce the need for weavers and spinners, and may
      increase the number of workers required for cotton growing. In such cases,
      a redistribution of energies and occupations will be essential, and it can
      only be carried out with success if every worker in communist society is a
      master of several crafts. Bourgeois society meets these difficulties by
      the expedient of the industrial reserve army, which means that there is
      always a greater or smaller residue of unemployed. In communist society
      there will be no army of unemployed. The reserve of workers requisite for
      any branch of production in which a deficiency of labour power makes
      itself apparent, will be constituted by the competence of workers in other
      branches of production to fill the vacant places. The unified labour
      school, and nothing else, can provide for the training of workers who will
      be able to perform the most diverse functions of communist society.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="081"></A>§ 81. Specialist education</H4>
    
    <P>Up to the age of seventeen, all the young people in the republic must
      attend the unified labour school, acquiring there the sum of theoretical
      and practical knowledge indispensable to every citizen of communist
      society. But instruction must not end there. Specialist knowledge is
      requisite in addition to general knowledge. The totality of the most
      indispensable sciences is so vast, that no individual can grasp it in its
      entirety. The unification of education in the unified labour school is by
      no means intended to exclude specialist training. Our aim merely is to
      defer specialist training till the last stage is reached. Already during
      the later stages of work in the unified labour school, in the case of
      pupils between the ages of fourteen and seventeen, inclination towards one
      occupation or another will invariably become manifest. It is not merely
      possible, but it is also necessary, to give an outlet to the natural
      desire for a more intimate acquaintance with certain of the sciences. But
      of course this must not be done to the detriment of the general
      educational programme of the labour school.</P>
    
    <P>Real specialist training should not, however, begin until after the age
      of seventeen. The age limit is selected for various reasons. Until
      seventeen, the pupils at the labour school are scholars rather than
      workers. The fundamental aim of the labour processes in the school is not
      that of creating values and of contributing to the State budget, but that
      of conveying instruction. After the age of seventeen, the pupil becomes a
      worker. He must perform his quota of labour, must play his due part in
      producing goods for the human community. He can receive specialist
      instruction only in so far as he has first fulfilled his fundamental duty
      towards society. For this reason, as is right, specialist instruction for
      young people after the age of seventeen can only be given out of working
      hours. With the advance of manufacturing technique we may expect the
      working day to become less than eight hours, and in this way there will be
      provided for every member of communist society plenty of time for
      specialist education. In certain cases, and where persons of unusual
      talent are concerned, it may prove desirable to make exceptions in the
      form of exemption from labour for a certain number of years, in order to
      provide opportunity for study or for research work. If complete exemption
      from labour should seem undesirable in the social interest, there may be a
      special reduction of the working hours for such individuals.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="082"></A>§ 82. The university</H4>
    
    <P>At the present time it is still impossible to foresee precisely what
      character the higher schools for specialist training will assume under
      communism. They will probably be of various types. There will be places
      where brief courses will be given. There will be polytechnics and
      laboratory schools, at which instruction will be furnished while at the
      same time experimental research is being carried on; in these, all
      distinction between professors and students will have disappeared. But
      even today we can be perfectly sure that the universities in their present
      form, with their present professorial staffs, have ceased to be
      serviceable institutions. They carry a stage farther the same sort of
      instruction which was provided in the bourgeois middle schools of the old
      type. For the time being these universities may be reformed by leavening
      the professorial staffs through the addition of persons who may not
      perhaps attain the standard of the 'learned specialists of bourgeois
      society', but who will be fully competent to effect the necessary
      revolution in the teaching of the social sciences, and will be able to
      expel bourgeois culture from its last refuge. Furthermore, the composition
      of the audiences will be changed, for most of the students will be
      workers, and of course in this way technical science will pass into the
      possession of the working class. But the attendance of the workers at the
      universities will necessarily involve their maintenance at the cost of the
      State throughout the period of instruction. All this is considered in the
      educational section of the party programme.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="083"></A>§ 83. Soviet schools and party schools</H4>
    
    <P>During the Kerensky régime the tsarist school apparatus was left
      practically intact. The Communist Party, having attained to power, made it
      its business to destroy this apparatus entirely. Upon the ruins of the old
      class school the communists have begun the construction of the unified
      labour school, as the embryo of the normal labour school of communist
      society. They are endeavouring to eradicate from the bourgeois university
      everything which used to promote the maintenance of the capitalist
      dominion. The knowledge that has been accumulated during the ages when the
      possessing classes were in power, is being made accessible to all the
      workers. Thus is being begun the construction of the normal type of
      university for communist society.</P>
    
    <P>But among all the sciences known to bourgeois culture, there was not one
      which gave any information as to how the proletarian revolution was to be
      achieved. Among all the schools which the bourgeoisie has founded and
      which communist society has begun to reconstruct, there was not one to
      teach how the proletarian State is to be upbuilded. The transitional
      period between capitalism and communism has given birth to a special type
      of school, which is intended to be serviceable to the revolution now in
      progress and to assist in the construction of the soviet apparatus. Such
      were the aims of the party and soviet schools which have grown up under
      our own eyes, in order to give brief and occasional courses of
      instruction, and which are being transformed into permanent institutions
      for the training of those who work in the party and in the soviets. The
      transformation was inevitable. The upbuilding of a soviet State is an
      entirely new undertaking. There is no historical precedent for anything of
      the kind. The work of the soviet institutions develops and improves day by
      day; it is essential to success that every worker in the soviets should be
      able to avail himself of all the experience of his predecessors.
      Self-education in administrative work, such as can be effected by the
      participation of all the workers in the soviets, would seem to be
      insufficient. This experience must be collected, systematized, elaborated,
      and made available to all the workers who are engaged in the upbuilding of
      the soviet system, so that each relay of workers which comes to
      participate in the administration can be saved from committing the faults
      of its predecessors; so that the new arrivals can learn, not from their
      own mistakes, but from the mistakes which have been made by others, and
      for which the State has once already had to pay. Now the schools for
      soviet work must also serve this end, and we already have in the Soviet
      Republic a central school of soviet work in the All-Russian Central
      Executive Committee, which is a permanent school. Soon, doubtless, similar
      schools of soviet work will be established in the capitals of all the
      provinces.</P>
    
    <P>Passing now to consider the party schools, we find that they have
      undergone a radical change in character during the period of actual
      transition to communism. At first they were the schools of a definite
      party, supported by the proletariat, and in this stage they had a purely
      political character. Now they have become places where instruction is
      given in the communist transformation of society, and they are therefore
      State schools. At the same time they are military academies for the
      purposes of the civil war. It has only been thanks to these schools that
      the proletariat has been able to form an idea of the objective
      significance of the transformation which it is undergoing half
      unwittingly, almost instinctively narrower concrete aims, and - for as yet
      it only realizes the is incompetent to grasp the nature of the
      revolutionary process as a whole. The party schools are not only able to
      provide the proletariat with a scientific explanation of the nature and
      goal of the revolution, but they can also teach the workers how to achieve
      the aims of the revolution by the shortest route and with the least
      expenditure of effort.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="084"></A>§ 84. Extra-scholastic instruction</H4>
    
    <P>Under the tsarist régime the vast majority of the working
      population was deliberately kept in a permanent state of ignorance and
      illiteracy. An enormous percentage of illiterates was handed down by the
      autocracy to the Soviet Power, which has naturally been compelled to adopt
      heroic measures in order to deliver itself from the legacy. The
      departments of public instruction have opened schools for adults unable to
      read and write, and have taken a number of additional steps to put an end
      to illiteracy. But apart from the utilization of the scholastic apparatus
      of the Commissariat for Education, the Communist Party must do its utmost
      to ensure that the masses shall avail themselves of the opportunities that
      offer for the instruction of illiterates. Here the soviets for popular
      culture, elected from among all the workers and peasants who are
      interested in educational matters, must play their part. A further means
      has been the mobilization of all who can read and write for the
      instruction of all the illiterates. Such a mobilization is beginning in
      various parts of the republic, and it is the business of the party to
      ensure that the movement shall everywhere be conducted in accordance with
      a definite plan.</P>
    
    <P>In addition to carrying on the struggle against illiteracy, the Soviet
      Power must devote much energy and much material means to the assistance of
      the self-cultural endeavours of the population, and especially of adults.
      Numerous libraries have been inaugurated to satisfy the demands of the
      working population. Wherever possible, people's houses and clubs have been
      established and people's universities have been created. The cinema, which
      has hitherto served as a means for demoralizing the masses and for
      enriching the owners, is gradually, though very slowly, becoming one of
      the most potent instruments for the enlightenment of the masses and for
      their education in the spirit of socialism. Lecture courses of various
      kinds, gratuitous and accessible to all, can now, thanks to the shorter
      working day, become a general possession of the workers. In the future, of
      great significance in the matter of enlightenment will be the careful
      organization of holiday excursions, which will enable the workers to
      become acquainted with their own land and with the foreign world. There
      can be no doubt that in days to come such excursions will have immense
      importance for the workers of all countries.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="085"></A>§ 85. New workers on behalf of enlightenment</H4>
    
    <P>The educational reforms of the Soviet Power have been more successful
      than the reforms and innovations effected in any other department. There
      is an additional reason for this besides the fact that the Soviet State
      devotes to popular education an enormously greater proportion of its
      revenues than is devoted to this purpose by any bourgeois State. Over and
      above, we have to remember that the way for the realization of the idea of
      the unified labour school had already to a notable extent been prepared by
      the most advanced educationists of bourgeois society. The leading Russian
      educationists have been able under the soviet régime to realize in
      practice, to a notable extent, that which from a purely pedagogical
      outlook they had already come to regard as socially necessary. Among the
      educational workers who have rallied from the side of the bourgeoisie and
      the landed interest to the side of the Soviet Power, we find quite a
      number of individuals who were and still are opposed to the proletarian
      revolution in general, but who are heartily in favour of the revolution
      that has been achieved by the proletariat in the educational field.</P>
    
    <P>These favourable conditions, however, by no means suffice to overcome
      the difficulties of the proletarian State as far as concerns the provision
      of genuinely communist educational workers. The number of communists among
      the teachers, as among specialists in general, is but an insignificant
      minority. Most teachers are opposed to communism. The majority of them,
      however, are persons with an official type of mind, who are ready to serve
      any government and to work to any schedule, but who have a special
      fondness for a programme which was familiar to their fathers and their
      grandfathers. As concerns this matter, therefore, the communists have a
      twofold task. In the first place, they must mobilize all the best elements
      of the teaching profession, and by intensified activity must create among
      them nuclei of communist endeavour. In the second place, the Communist
      Party has to create out of the younger generation an entirely new school
      of educationists, consisting of persons who have from the very first been
      trained in the spirit of communism, and above all in the spirit of the
      communist educational programme.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="086"></A>§ 86. The treasures of art and science made
    available to the workers</H4>
    
    <P>Under capitalism, talent is looked upon as the private property of its
      immediate possessor, and is regarded as a means of enrichment. In
      capitalist society, the product of talented activity is a commodity which
      can be sold for one price or another, and thus becomes the possession of
      the person with the longest purse. A work of genius, a thing with infinite
      social significance, and one whose essential nature is that of a
      collective creation, can be purchased by a Russian named Kolupayev or by
      an American named Morgan, and the buyer is then entitled to change it or
      to destroy it as fancy dictates. If Tretyakov, the famous Moscow merchant,
      had one fine day made up his mind to burn down his picture gallery instead
      of presenting it to the town of Moscow, there was no law in capitalist
      society by which he could have been called to account. As a result of the
      private purchase and sale of works of art, rare books, manuscripts, etc.,
      many of them are rendered inaccessible to the broad masses of the people,
      and these rarities become the exclusive possessions of members of the
      exploiting class. The Soviet Republic has declared all works of art,
      collections, etc., to be social property, and it removes every obstacle to
      their social utilization. The same purpose is served by the decrees aiming
      at the withdrawal from private ownership of great libraries, so that these
      also have become social property.</P>
    
    <P>The Communist Party must see to it that the State authority continues to
      advance along such lines. In view of the present lack of books and of the
      impossibility of speedily issuing large editions and reprints, it is
      necessary that there should be a further restriction of private ownership,
      and that books should be assembled in public libraries, in schools, etc.</P>
    
    <P>Furthermore, in the interests of enlightenment, and in order to secure
      for the widest possible number of persons the opportunity of visiting the
      theatre, all the theatres have been nationalized, and thus in an indirect
      way there has been achieved the socialization of dramatic, musical, and
      vocal art.</P>
    
    <P>By degrees, therefore, all the works of science and art - which were
      created in the first instance by the exploitation of the toiling masses,
      were a burden upon their backs, were produced at their cost - have now
      been restored to the real owners.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="087"></A>§ 87. The state propaganda of communism</H4>
    
    <P>Now that the capitalist system has been overthrown, and now that upon
      its ruins the new communist society is being built up, the propaganda of
      communist ideas cannot be left solely to the Communist Party and cannot be
      conducted with its modest means alone. Communist propaganda has become a
      necessity for the whole society now undergoing regeneration. It must
      accelerate the inevitable process of transformation. To the innovators,
      who often work without being fully aware of what they are doing, communist
      propaganda must reveal the significance of their energies and their
      labours. It is therefore necessary that not merely the proletarian school
      but in addition the whole mechanism of the proletarian State should
      contribute to the work of communist propaganda. This propaganda must be
      carried on in the army; it must be carried on in and by all the
      instruments of the Soviet Power.</P>
    
    <P>The most powerful method of State communist propaganda is the State
      publishing activity. The nationalization of all the reserves of paper and
      of all the printing establishments, makes it possible for the proletarian
      State, despite the great scarcity of paper, to publish by the million any
      literature which is peculiarly important for the masses at a given moment.
      Everything issued from the State presses is made available to the
      generality of the people by publication at a very low price, and by
      degrees it is becoming possible to issue books, pamphlets, newspapers, and
      posters, gratuitously. The State propaganda of communism becomes in the
      long run a means for the eradication of the last traces of bourgeois
      propaganda dating from the old régime; and it is a powerful
      instrument for the creation of a new ideology, of new modes of thought, of
      a new outlook on the world.</P>

    <P>We see that the transference of power to the proletariat was immediately
      followed by nearly a tenfold increase in the expenditure upon popular
      education.</P>
    
    <P>In the year 1917 there were on 1 September, 38,387 elementary schools
      (in 26 provinces).</P>
    
    <P>In the school year 1917-18 there were 52,274 elementary schools, with
      4,138,982 pupils.</P>
    
    <P>In the school year 1918-19 there were approximately 62,238 elementary
      schools.</P>
    
    <P>As regards middle schools, in the school year 1917-18 there were 1,830,
      and in the school year 1918-19 there were 3,783.</P>
    
    <P>Preparatory schools and similar institutions were quite unknown under
      the tsarist régime. In this matter the Soviet Power had to make an
      entirely new start. Notwithstanding the unfavourable circumstances, by 1
      October 1919, in 31 provinces, the kindergartens, play schools, and homes
      numbered 2,615, and cared for 155&gt;443 children. At this date, about 2.5
      per cent of all the children from three to five years of age were
      attending such institutions. In the towns, the percentage of children
      cared for in this way is now low, and the proportion continually rises.</P>

      In tsarist Russia the method by which the masses of the people were kept
      in subjection to the aristocratic State was not, on the whole, that of a
      bourgeois-priestly-tsarist enlightenment, but simply that of withholding
      enlightenment of any sort. In this connexion we may refer to the notorious
      'theory' of the celebrated obscurantist Pobedonostsev, who considered
      popular ignorance to be the main prop of the autocracy.</P>
