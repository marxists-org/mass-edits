    <H3>Chapter 9: Proletarian Justice</H3>
    
    <H4><A NAME="070"></A>§ 70. The administration of justice in bourgeois
    society</H4>
    
    <P>Among the various institutions of bourgeois society which serve to
      oppress and deceive the working masses, must be mentioned bourgeois
      justice. This estimable institution is carried on under the guidance of
      laws passed in the interests of the exploiting class. Whatever the
      composition of the court, its decisions are restricted in accordance with
      the volumes of statutes in which are incorporated all the privileges of
      capital and all the lack of privileges of the toiling masses.</P>
    
    <P>As far as the organization of bourgeois justice is concerned, this is in
      perfect harmony with the characteristics of the bourgeois State. Where the
      bourgeois State is comparatively frank in its methods, where it is free
      from hypocrisy in its determination that the decision of the courts shall
      be favourable to the ruling class, there the judges are appointed from
      above; but even when they are elected, only the members of the privileged
      stratum are entitled to vote. When the masses have been sufficiently
      brought to heel by capital, so that they are duly submissive and regard
      the laws of the bourgeois State as their own laws, the workers are
      permitted to a certain extent to be their own judges, just as they are
      allowed to vote exploiters and their henchmen into parliament. Thus
      originated trial by jury, thanks to which legal decisions made in the
      interests of capital can masquerade as decisions made by the 'whole
      people'.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="071"></A>§ 71. The election of the judiciary by the
    workers</H4>
    
    <P>The programme of the Socialists adhering to the Second International
      contained a demand for the popular election of the judiciary. In the epoch
      of the proletarian dictatorship, this demand assumes a no less
      impracticable and reactionary complexion than the demand for universal
      suffrage or the demand for the general arming of the people. When the
      proletariat is in power, it cannot permit the enemies of its class to
      become judges. The workers could hardly accept the representatives of
      capital or of the landed interest as administrators of the new laws which
      are intended to overthrow the capitalist régime! In fine, in the
      long succession of civil and criminal affairs, the proceedings of the
      courts must be conducted in the spirit of the new socialist society which
      is in course of construction.</P>
    
    <P>For these reasons the Soviet Power did not merely destroy all the old
      machinery of justice which, while serving capital, hypocritically
      proclaimed itself to be the voice of the people. It went farther, and
      constituted new courts, making no attempt to conceal their class
      character. In the old law-courts, the class minority of exploiters passed
      judgement upon the working majority. The law-courts of the proletarian
      dictatorship are places where the working majority passes judgement upon
      the exploiting minority. They are specially constructed for this purpose.
      The judges are elected by the workers alone. The judges are elected solely
      from among the workers. For the exploiters the only right that remains is
      the right of being judged.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="072"></A>§ 72. Unified popular law-courts</H4>
    
    <P>In bourgeois society the administration of justice is an exceed ingly
      cumbrous affair. Bourgeois jurists proudly declare that, thanks to the
      gradation of lower courts, higher courts, courts of appeal, and so on,
      absolute justice is ensured, and the number of miscarriages of justice
      reduced to a minimum. In actual fact, in the past and today, the working
      of this graded series of law courts has been and is to the unfailing
      advantage of the possessing classes. Well-to-do persons, being able to
      command the services of highly paid lawyers, can carry a case from court
      to court until they secure a favourable decision; whereas a plaintiff who
      is poor often finds it necessary to abandon his suit on grounds of
      expense. The right of appeal secures an 'equitable' decision only in this
      sense, that it secures a judgement in the interest of exploiting groups.</P>
    
    <P>The unified popular law-court of the proletarian State reduces to a
      minimum the time which elapses from the moment when the case is brought
      before the court to the moment when it is finally decided. The law's delay
      is greatly diminished, and if proceedings are still sluggish, this is only
      because all soviet institutions are imperfect during the first months and
      years of the proletarian dictatorship. But the general upshot is that the
      courts have been made accessible to the poorest and most unenlightened
      strata of the population; and they will become still more accessible as
      soon as the epoch of intensified civil war is over, and as soon as all the
      mutual relationships of the citizens of the republic have assumed a more
      stable character. <I>Inter arma leges silent</I> [in war time, the laws
      are in abeyance] the Romans used to say. But during the time of civil war
      the laws are not in abeyance as far as the workers are concerned. The
      popular law-courts continue to do their work, but it is impossible as yet
      for the whole population to realize the nature of the new courts of
      justice and rightly to appreciate their advantages.</P>
    
    <P>During this era when the old society is being destroyed and the new
      society is being upbuilded, the popular courts have a gigantic task to
      perform. The process of change has been so rapid that soviet legislation
      has not been able to keep pace with it. The laws of the bourgeois landlord
      system have been annulled; but the laws of the proletarian State have as
      yet merely been outlined, and will never be committed to paper in their,
      entirety. The workers do not intend to perpetuate their dominion, and they
      therefore have no need for endless tomes of written laws. When they have
      expressed their will in one of the fundamental decrees, they can leave the
      interpretation and application of these decrees, as far as practical
      details are concerned, to the popular courts in which the judges are
      elected by the workers. The only important matter is that the decisions of
      these courts shall bear witness to the complete breach with the customs
      and the ideology of the bourgeois system; that the people's judges shall
      decide the cases which come before them in accordance with the dictates of
      proletarian ideology, and not in accordance with those of bourgeois
      ideology. Dealing with the unending series of disputes which arise during
      the break-up of the old relationships, and during the realization of the
      rights of the proletariat, the people's judges can carry to its proper
      issue the transformation which began with the November revolution of the
      year 1917, and which must inevitably involve all the mutual relationships
      of the citizens of the Soviet Republic. On the other hand, in dealing with
      the vast number of cases which occur independently of the peculiar
      conditions of the revolutionary era - minor criminal cases of a petty-
      bourgeois character - the popular courts must give expression to the
      entirely new attitude towards such offences which has been adopted by the
      revolutionary proletariat, thus effecting a revolution in the whole
      character of penal measures.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="073"></A>§ 73. Revolutionary tribunals</H4>
    
    <P>These popular courts - to which the judges are elected, from which the
      judges can be recalled, and in which every worker must fulfil his judicial
      duty when his turn comes - are looked upon by the Communist Party as the
      normal law-courts of the proletarian State. But in the epoch of the
      extremest intensifica tion of the civil war, it has been found necessary
      to supplement the popular courts by the appointment of revolutionary tri
      bunals. The function of the revolutionary tribunals is to deal speedily
      and mercilessly with the enemies of the proletarian revolution. Such
      courts are among the weapons for the crushing of the exploiters, and from
      this point of view they are just as much the instruments of proletarian
      offence and defence as the Red Guard, the Red Army, and the Extraordinary
      Commissions. Consequently, the revolutionary tribunals are organized on
      less democratic lines than the popular courts. They are appointed by the
      soviets, and are not directly elected by the workers.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="074"></A>§ 74. Proletarian penal methods</H4>
    
    <P>In the sanguinary struggle with capitalism, the working class cannot
      refrain from inflicting the last extremity of punishment upon its declared
      enemies. While the civil war continues, the abolition of the death penalty
      is impossible. But a dispassionate comparison of proletarian justice with
      the justice of the bourgeois counter-revolution shows the marvellous
      leniency of the workers' courts in comparison with the executioners of
      bourgeois justice. The workers pass death sentences in extreme cases only.
      This was especially characteristic of the legal proceedings during the
      first months of the proletarian dictatorship. It suffices to recall that
      in Petrograd the notorious Purishkevich was condemned to only two weeks'
      imprisonment by the revolutionary tribunal. We find that the progressive
      classes, the inheritors of the future, have dealt very gently with their
      enemies, whereas the classes that are dying have displayed almost
      incredible ferocity.</P>
    
    <P>When we come to consider the punishments inflicted by proletarian courts
      of justice for criminal offences which have no counter- revolutionary
      bearing, we find them to be radically different from those inflicted for
      similar offences by bourgeois courts. This is what we should expect. The
      great majority of crimes committed in bourgeois society are either direct
      infringements of property rights or are indirectly connected with
      property. It is natural that the bourgeois State should take vengeance
      upon criminals, and that the punishments inflicted by bourgeois society
      should be various expressions of the vengeful sentiments of the infuriated
      owner. Just as absurd have been and are the punishments inflicted for
      casual offences, or for offences which arise out of the fundamentally
      imperfect character of personal relationships in bourgeois society
      (offences connected with the family relationships of society; those
      resulting from romanticist inclinations; those due to alcoholism or to
      mental degeneration; those due to ignorance, or to a suppression of social
      instinct, etc.). The proletarian law-court has to deal with offences for
      which the ground has been prepared by bourgeois society, by the society
      whose vestiges are still operative. A large number of professional
      criminals, trained to become such in the old order, survive to give work
      for the proletarian courts. But these courts are entirely free from the
      spirit of revenge. They cannot take vengeance upon people simply because
      these happen to have lived in bourgeois society. This is why our courts
      manifest a revolutionary change in the character of their decisions. More
      and more frequently do we find that conditional sentences are imposed,
      punishments that do not involve any punishment, 'their chief aim being to
      prevent a repetition of the offence. Another method is that of social
      censure, a method that can only be effective in a classless society, one
      in which a social consciousness and a social sense of responsibility have
      greatly increased. Imprisonment without any occupation, enforced
      parasitism, the penal method so frequently employed under the tsarist régime,
      is replaced by the enforcement of social labour. The aim of the
      proletarian courts is to ensure that the damage done to society by the
      criminal shall be made good by him through the performance of an increased
      amount of social labour. Finally, when the court has to deal with a
      habitual criminal (one whose liberation after his sentence has been
      performed will entail danger to the lives of other citizens), isolation of
      the criminal from society is enforced, but in such away as to give the
      offender full opportunities for moral regeneration.</P>
    
    <P>Most of the measures above described, involving a complete
      transformation of the customary penal methods, have already been
      recommended by the best bourgeois criminologists. But in bourgeois society
      they remain a dream. Nothing but the victory of the proletariat can ensure
      their realization.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="075"></A>§ 75. Proletarian justice in the future</H4>
    
    <P>As far as the revolutionary tribunals are concerned, this form of
      proletarian justice has no significance for future days, any more than the
      Red Army will have any significance for the future after it has conquered
      the White Guards, or any more than the Extraordinary Commissions have any
      significance for the future. In a word, all the instruments created by the
      proletariat for the critical period of the civil war are transient. When
      the counter-revolution has been successfully crushed, these instruments
      will no longer be needed, and they will disappear.</P>
    
    <P>On the other hand, proletarian justice in the form of the elective
      popular courts will unquestionably survive the end of the civil war, and
      will for a long period have to continue the use of measures to deal with
      the vestiges of bourgeois society in its manifold manifestations. The
      abolition of classes will not result in the immediate abolition of class
      ideology, which is more long-lived than are the social conditions which
      have produced it, more enduring than the class instincts and class customs
      which have brought it into being. Besides, the abolition of class may
      prove a lengthy process. The transformation of the bourgeoisie into
      working folk and that of the peasants into the workers of a socialist
      society will be a tardy affair. The change in peasant ideology is likely
      to be very slow, and will give plenty of work to the law-courts. Moreover,
      during the period which must precede the full development of communist
      distribution, the period during which the articles of consumption are
      still privately owned, there will be ample occasion for delinquencies and
      crimes. Finally, anti-social offences arising out of personal egoism, and
      all sorts of offences against the common weal, will long continue to
      provide work for the courts. It is true that these courts will gradually
      change in character. As the State dies out, they will tend to become
      simply organs for the expression of public opinion. They will assume the
      character of courts of arbitration. Their decisions will no longer be
      enforced by physical means and will have a purely moral significance.</P>
