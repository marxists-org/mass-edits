<H3>Chapter Introduction: The Conditions of Communist Activity in Russia</H3>

<H4><A NAME="041"></a>§ 41 The international situation of Russia</H4><br>


<P>As we have previously noted, the necessity for the communist
revolution arises above all from the circumstance that Russia
has become intimately connected with the system of world
economy. Our country is now merely a part of the world
economy. If the question arises, in what way Russia can advance
to the communist system in spite of the backward condition of
the country, the answer will mainly be given by pointing to the
international significance of the revolution. The proletarian
revolution must today be a world revolution. On world lines
only can it develop. Central and Western Europe will inevitably
pass under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and in this way to
communism. How, then, could Russia remain a capitalist
country if Germany, France, and England were to pass under
the proletarian dictatorship? It is plain that Russia must
become involved in the movement to socialism. Her backward
ness, the comparatively undeveloped state of her industry, and
so on, would all be overcome if Russia were to form part of
an international, or even merely a European, soviet republic,
and thus to be associated with more advanced lands. It is
true that Europe will be terribly exhausted and weakened after
the devastation of the war and after the revolution. But a
vigorous and highly developed proletariat will be able in the
course of a few years to re-establish the industrial system on a
firm footing, and even backward Russia will be able to do the
same. Russia possesses great natural resources in the form of timber, coal, 
mineral oil, iron, etc.; she has
vast corn lands; with proper organization and under peace conditions, all 
could be turned to proper
account. For our part, we could help our western comrades with Russian raw 
materials. Provided that
the whole of Europe were to be under the authority of the proletariat, 
there would be such a
development of production as would provide amply for all needs. Since, 
however, the proletariat will
inevitably rise to power everywhere, it is obvious that the mission of the 
Russian working class is to do
its utmost on behalf of the transformation to communism. It is for this 
reason, as we have learned in Part
One, that our party has made the prompt establishment of communism its 
definite aim.</P>
<H4><A NAME="042"></a>§ 42 Large-scale industry in Russia</H4>


<P>Russian manufacturing industry, however, though a small
affair in comparison with Russian agriculture, had been organ
ized in accordance with the methods of large-scale capitalist
production. In Part One we pointed out that in the most
important branches of capitalist production in Russia there
were enterprises employing ten thousand workers and upwards.
From 1907 onwards, the centralization of Russian industry
made rapid progress, and production passed under the control of
a network of syndicates and trusts. When the war began, the
bourgeoisie started the organization of State capitalism. This
confirms our view that Russian industry can be organized and
administered as a unified whole, even though the process may
offer difficulties. It is interesting to note that the right social
revolutionaries and the mensheviks, who are never weary of
proclaiming that socialism is absolutely impossible in Russia,
have always advocated the State regulation and control of
industry. But they only believed in the necessity for this when
all authority was in the hands of the bourgeoisie, when the
'regulating' and 'controlling' power was to be that of the
capitalist State. In other words, the mensheviks and the essers,
despite their protestations of patriotism, were in favour of
State capitalism on the Prussian model. But it is perfectly plain that we 
cannot believe State capitalism
to be possible unless we also believe in the possibility of the socialist 
organization of economic life. The
only difference between the two systems lies in this, that in one case 
industry is organized by the
bourgeois State, and that in the other case it is organized by the 
proletarian State. If industrial
production in Russia were so backward that there could be no possibility of 
its being organized by the
proletarian State, then there could be no possibility of organizing it upon 
State capitalist foundations
either. In a country where large-scale industry does not exist, and where 
production is carried on by
quantities of small masters, it will be impossible to organize industry 
even upon State capitalist lines.
We know perfectly well that the centralization of industry only becomes 
possible when the
centralization of capital has advanced to a certain stage. Now Russian 
capitalism had already reached
this stage of centralization. Even the opponents of communism recognized 
this by the very fact that
they considered it possible for the bourgeois State to 'regulate industry'. 
The backwardness of Russian
economic life did not consist in the absence of great factories, for there 
were plenty; it consisted in the
fact that manufacturing industry taken as a whole was of small extent when 
compared with agriculture.
The logical inference is that, despite all difficulties, the Russian 
proletariat must organize industry in a
proletarian fashion, and must maintain its grip of industry until help 
comes from the west. As far as
Russian agriculture is concerned, we must establish a number of focal 
points where comrades carry on
cooperative production. When, however, Russian manufacturing industry is 
able to join forces with the
productive industry of the west, then the joint organization of production 
will speedily enable us to
draw the petty producers and the peasants into a general and immense 
cooperative organization. If, for
instance, there existed one great European system of production organized 
by the working class, then
vast quantities of the products of urban industry could be supplied to the 
rural districts. But town
industry will have to furnish these products to the countryside in an 
organized manner. No longer, as of
old, would a hundred thousand
petty traders, middlemen, and speculators, cater for the needs of the rural 
districts. These needs would
be satisfied from State warehouses. Manifestly, the peasants, too, would 
have in return to hand over
their grain in an organized manner. By degrees the country districts would 
become accustomed to
social production. A stage farther on, and rural life would be that of a 
great cooperative family. A
vigorous and well-organized industrial system would ultimately lead to a 
communal life in the villages
as well. With the aid of such a system, it would be possible to come to the 
help of the peasant, who
would realize that life on the new plan was a great deal better.</P>

<P>But to reach this goal is difficult. Many years must pass before the 
necessary changes can be effected
and before life can run smoothly along the new lines. Why it is difficult 
will be explained below.</P>



<H4><A NAME="043"></a>§ 43 The disastrous legacy of imperialist war</H4>


<P>Until the world revolution is victorious, Russia must act alone. Now the 
Russian working class
received a disastrous heritage when it conquered power in the year 1917. 
The whole country was
disorganized and impoverished.</P>

<P>The war had sapped all the country's strength. More than half the factories 
had been compelled to
devote themselves to war work, and had squandered materials in the work of 
destruction. In the year
1915, out of the eleven and a half milliards of the 'national income', six 
milliards were spent upon the
war. At the very beginning of the revolution, the terrible consequences of 
the war became apparent.
The output of engineering works had fallen by 40 per cent, and that of 
textile works by 20 per cent; a
great reduction was quickly apparent in the supply of coal, iron, and 
steel. Between I March and 1
August (old style), 1917, 568 enterprises were closed down, and more than 
100,000 proletarians were
thrown out of work. The national debt reached unprecedented figures. Month 
by month, day by day,
the condition of the country became more desperate.</P>
<P>
It is plain that the proletariat, when it rose to power in
November 1917, was faced by a task of unexampled difficulty, by the task of 
constructing a socialist
economy in an utterly disorganized land. The disastrous heritage grew yet 
more disastrous at the close
of the old imperialist war. The mere demobilization of our army involved 
enormous expenditure. The
transport system had already been shattered and disrupted by the war; 
demobilization was the
finishing stroke, and the railway system broke down almost completely. Thus 
transport came
practically to an end as well as production.</P>

<P>This is absolutely no argument against the workers' revolution. Had the 
bourgeoisie remained in power,
it would have continued to wage the great imperialist war, would have 
continued to pay vast sums as
interest to the French and to the British, and would have thrown all the 
burden - this is the chief thing
to remember - upon the shoulders of the workers and peasants. Our poverty 
and exhaustion would
more than ever have incited the proletariat to undertake the rebuilding of 
the old world upon new
foundations; with even more economy and with a yet more careful system of 
organization would it
have been necessary to utilize our old resources; and it would have been 
necessary to transfer as much
of the cost as possible to the bourgeoisie, would have been necessary to 
protect the working class with
whatever powers and by whatever means were at the disposal of the 
proletarian authority. But this
necessary work was thrust upon the revolutionary proletariat under 
conditions of almost incredible
difficulty. The workers had to clear up the mess which the imperialist 
lords had made.</P>



<H4><A NAME="044"></a>§ 44 The civil war and the struggle with international imperialism</H4>


<P>The bourgeoisie continued to do everything in its power to
hinder the working class from organizing production, and to
prevent the upbuilding of a workers' society. Immediately
after the victory of the proletariat, the bourgeoisie instituted a
widespread policy of sabotage. All those who had been high
officials, all the managing engineers, teachers, and bank clerks,
all those who had been masters, did everything they could to hinder work. 
Plot followed upon plot; one
counter-revolutionary rising succeeded another. The Russian bourgeoisie 
entered into alliances with the
Czechoslovaks, the Entente, the Germans, the Poles, etc.; an attempt was 
made to crush the Russian
proletariat by never-ending fights. The proletariat had to create a huge 
army, one able to repel the
onslaughts of the armies sent by the landlords and capitalists of all 
lands. The imperialists of the whole
world hurled their forces against the Russian proletariat.</P>

<P>This war is for the proletariat a holy war, a war of deliverance, but none 
the less it involves terrible costs.
The remnants of productive industry had to be devoted to the service of the 
Red Army; thousands of the
best organizers among the workers were called to the front. Furthermore, 
almost at the very outset, the
bourgeoisie was able to secure a strong grip of certain regions peculiarly 
important to the economic life of
the country. The military leaders of the Don Cossacks succeeded in 
depriving the working class of the
Donetz coal basin. The British seized the Baku oil-fields. The corn lands 
of Ukraine, Siberia, and part of
Transvolgia, were in the hands of the counterrevolution. The working class, 
therefore, had not merely to
stand to arms and to meet the onslaught of innumerable foes; it was 
compelled in addition to carry on its
proletarian economy in default of some of the most important means of 
production - in default of fuel and
raw materials.</P>

<P>These considerations show us what a martyr's road the workers had to tread. 
Their first task was to
overthrow their enemies. Not until this had been done could they begin to 
upbuild the new life properly.</P>

<P>In its struggle with the working class, the bourgeoisie likewise availed 
itself of all the means that could
effect the economic overthrow of the Russian proletariat. The capitalists 
encircled Russia on all sides; the
land was rigidly blockaded for years; in their retreats the Whites burned 
and destroyed everything. For
example, Admiral Kolchak burned ten million pounds of grain, destroyed a 
good half of the Volga fleet, and
so on. The resistance of the bourgeoisie, its frantic struggles, the aid 
given to it by world-wide imperialism - these constituted the second great 
obstacle in the path of the working
class.</P>



<H4><A NAME="045"></a>§ 45 The petty-bourgeois character of Russia, the lack of extensive organizatory experience on the part of the proletariat, etc.</H4>


<P>We have already seen that production in Russia was sufficiently centralized 
for the question to arise
whether it could be nationalized under proletarian control, whether it 
could be transferred to the ownership
of the workers' State, and whether its organization on new foundations 
could be undertaken. But in
comparison with the whole economic life of the country, manufacturing 
industry was still very weak. By
far the greater part of the population of Russia is not urban but rural. At 
the census of 1897, the town
population comprised 76,000,000 and the country population comprised 
101,000,000 (this includes Siberia,
etc., but excludes Finland). In 7973, according to Oganovsky's estimate, 
the urban population of Russia was,
in round figures, 30,000,000 and the rural population 140,000,000. At that 
date, therefore, the urban
population was a little less than 78 per cent of the whole. Moreover, of 
the town dwellers, by no means all
belong to the proletariat. The urban population includes the commercial 
class, the manufacturers, the petty
bourgeoisie, and the professional classes. In all, these strata number 
millions. It is true, of course, that in the
country districts we find exworkmen, semi-proletarians, and the poor 
peasants. These elements support
the workers. But they are less class-conscious than the urban workers, and 
are not so well organized.</P>

<P>The enormous majority of the population of Russia consists of petty owners. 
Although they groan under
the yoke of the capitalists and the landlords, they are so much accustomed 
to their system of separate,
proprietary, individual economy, that it is very difficult to win them over 
to the idea of the common cause,
to induce them to participate in the upbuilding of a cooperative 
commonwealth. Ingrained in the mind of
every petty proprietor is the notion of grasping something that shall be
entirely his own and shall have been taken away from another, the notion of 
working only for his
own account. This is why there will be great difficulties in installing 
communism in Russia, even
if the other difficulties be left out of account.</P>

<P>Our weakness is also reflected in the working class. Generally 
speaking, the Russian workers are
revolutionary minded; they have a fighting spirit. But we find among them 
backward elements,
persons unaccustomed to organization. Not all the workers axe like those of 
Petrograd. Many of
them are backward and ignorant; such persons are quite unused to work in a 
team. There are a
great many workers who are newcomers into the town. Most of these have the 
peasant
mentality, and solidarize themselves with the peasantry.</P>

<P>These deficiencies of the working class disappear in proportion as the 
workers are compelled to
struggle for their own cause. It is, however, obvious that the backwardness 
of a certain
proportion is a hindrance to the realization of our task. But, of course, 
it does not render
realization impossible.</P>
