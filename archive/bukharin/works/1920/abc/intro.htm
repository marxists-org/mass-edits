<H3>Introduction - Our Programme</H3>

<a name="001"></a><h4>§1. What is a programme?</h4>
<P>Every party pursues definite aims, whether it be a party of
landowners or capitalists, on the one hand, or a party of workers
or peasants, on the other. Every party must have definite aims,
for otherwise it is not a party. If it be a party representing the
interests of landowners, it will pursue the aims of landowners; it
will endeavour to tighten the grasp of the owners upon the
soil; to hold the peasants in bondage; to secure a high price for
the produce of the landowners' estates; to hire labour cheaply;
to rackrent the farms. If it be a party of capitalists and factory
owners, it will likewise have its own aims: to procure cheap
labour, to keep the workers well in hand, to find customers to
to toil harder - but, above all, so to arrange matters that the
workers will have no tendency to allow their thoughts to turn
towards ideas of a new social order; let the workers think that
there always have been masters and always will be masters.
Such are the aims of the factory owners. It is self-evident that
the workers and peasants will have utterly different aims from
these, seeing that their interests are utterly different from those
of the capitalists and landowners. People used to say: `What is
wholesome for a Russian is death to a German.' It would, in
fact, be more accurate to say: `What is wholesome for a worker
is death to a landowner or capitalist.' That is to say, the worker
has certain things to do, the capitalist other things, and the
landowner yet others. Not every landowner, however, thinks out
logically what is the best way of getting the last farthing out of
the peasants; many landowners are drunk most of the time, and do not
even trouble to consider their bailiff's reports. The same thing happens
in the case of the peasants and of the workers. There are some who say :
'Oh, well, we shall get along somehow; why bother? We shall go on
living as our fathers have always lived.' Such persons never achieve
anything, and do not even understand their own interests. On the other
hand, those who realize how they can best defend their own interests,
organize themselves into a party. Of course the class as a whole does
not enter the party, which is composed of the best and most energetic
members of the class; thus those who enter the party lead the rest. To
the Workers' Party (the Party of Communist Bolsheviks) adhere the
best of the workers and poorer peasants; to the Party of Landowners
and Capitalists (Cadets, the Party of Popular Freedom) adhere the most
energetic among the landowners, the capitalists, and their hangers-on
lawyers, professors, military officers, etc. Consequently, every party is
composed of the most intelligent elements in the class to which it
corresponds. For. this reason a landowner or capitalist who is a member
of an organized party will combat the peasants and workers far more
successfully than if he were not in such an organization. In like manner
an organized worker will be better able than an unorganized worker to
strive against the capitalists and landowners; for the organized worker
has well pondered the aims and interests of the working class, knows
how these interests are to be pursued, and has learned the shortest road.</P>

<P>ALL THE AIMS WHICH A PARTY REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF ITS CLASS
VIGOROUSLY PURSUES, CONSTITUTE THE PARTY PROGRAMME. Thus in the
programme is specified that for which any particular class has to strive.
In the programme of the Communist Party is specified that for which
the workers and the poorer peasants have to strive. The programme is
for every party a matter of supreme importance. From the programme
we can always learn what interests the party represents.</P>

<a name="002"></a><h4>§2. What was our previous programme?</h4>
<P>Our present programme was adopted by the Eighth Party Congress at
the end of March 1919. Prior to this we had not a precise programme,
written on paper. We had nothing but the old programme elaborated at
the Second Party Congress in the year 1903. When this old programme
was compiled, the bolsheviks and the mensheviks constituted a single
party, and they had a common programme. At that date the organization
of the working class was only just beginning. There were very few
factories and workshops. Disputes were actually still going on as to
whether a working class would ever come into existence in Russia. The
'narodniks' (the fathers of the present social revolutionaries) considered
that the working class was not destined to develop in Russia, that in our
country there would be no extensive growth of factories and workshops.
The Marxists - the social democrats, subsequently to divide into
bolsheviks and mensheviks - supposed, on the other hand, that in
Russia, as elsewhere, the working class would continue to grow and
would constitute the main strength of the revolution. Time proved that
the views of the narodniks were wrong and that those of the social
democrats were right. But at the date when the programme of the social
democrats was elaborated by the Second Party Congress (both Lenin
and Plekhanov participating in the work), the strength of the Russian
working class was extremely small. That is why no one then imagined
that it would be possible to undertake the direct overthrow of the
bourgeoisie. At that time the best policy seemed: to break the neck of
tsardom; to win freedom of association for the workers and peasants in
conjunction with all others; to establish the eight-hour day; and to
reduce the power of the landowners. No one then dreamed that it would
be possible to realize the rule of the workers once and for all, or
immediately to dispossess the bourgeoisie of its factories and
workshops. Such was our old programme of the year 1903.</P>

<a name="003"></a><h4>§3. Why was it necessary to draw up a new programme?</h4>
<P>A considerable period intervened between 1903 and the revolution Of
1917, and during this time circumstances altered profoundly. In Russia,
large-scale industry advanced with giant strides, and concomitantly there
occurred a great increase in the numbers of the working class. As early as
the revolution of 1905, the workers showed their strength. By the time of
the second revolution (1917) it had become plain that the victory of the
revolution could only be achieved through the victory of the working
class. But in 1917 the working class could not be satisfied with that
which might have contented it in 1905. The workers had now so fully
matured that it was inevitable they should demand the seizure of the
factories and workshops, the overthrow of the capitalists, and the
establishment of workingclass rule. That is to say, since the formulation
of the first programme there had occurred in Russia a fundamental change
in internal conditions. Yet more important is it that in like manner there
had taken place a change in external conditions. In the year 1905, 'peace
and quiet' prevailed throughout Europe. In the year 1917, no intelligent
person could fail to see that the world war was leading up to the world
revolution. In 1905, the Russian revolution was followed by nothing
more than a slight movement among the Austrian workers, and by
revolutions in the more backward countries of the east - Persia, Turkey,
and China. The Russian revolution of 1917 is being followed by
revolutions in the west as well as in the east, by revolutions in which the
working class raises its banner on behalf of the overthrow of capitalism.
Both at home and abroad, therefore, conditions are very different from
those of the year 1903. It would be absurd for the party of the working
class to have one and the same programme in 1903 and in 1917-19, seeing
that now the circumstances are utterly different. When the mensheviks
find fault with us on the ground that we have 'repudiated' our old
programme, and that in so doing we have repudiated the teaching of
Marx, we reply that the essence of Marx's teaching is to construct
programmes, not out of the inner
consciousness, but out of life itself. If life had undergone grea changes, the
programme cannot be left as it was. In winter we have to wear thick
overcoats. In the heat of summer only a madman wears a thick overcoat.
It is just the same in politics. Marx himself taught us that we should
always study the existing conditions of life and act accordingly. This does
not mean that we should change our convictions as a fine lady changes her
gloves. The primary aim of the working class is the realization of the
communist order. This aim is a permanent aim. It is, however, selfevident that, according as the working class stands far from or close to its
goal, it will put forward different demands. Under tsarist rule workingclass organizations were driven underground and the workers' party was
persecuted as if its members had been criminals. Now, the working class
is in power, and its party is the ruling party. Obviously no intelligent
person could advocate exactly the same programme for the year 1903 and
for the present time.</P>

<P>Thus, the changes in the internal conditions of Russian life and the
changes in international circumstances have necessitated changes in our
programme.</P>

<a name="004"></a><h4>§4. The meaning of our programme?</h4>
<P>Our new (Moscow) programme is the first programme drawn
up by the party of the working class since it attained to power
some time ago. It is therefore necessary for our party to turn
to account all the experience which the working class has
gained in administering and upbuilding the new life. This is
important, not only for ourselves, not only for the Russian
workers and poorer peasants, but also for our foreign comrades.
For from our successes and failures, from our mistakes and
oversights, experience will be gained, not by ourselves alone, but
by the whole international proletariat. This is why our programme contains, not merely what our party wishes to accomplish, but also that which it has to some extent accomplished.
Every member of our party must be familiar with the programme
in all its details. It constitutes the most important guide to the
activities of every group and of every individual member of the
party. For no one can be a member of the party unless he has accepted
the programme, unless he regards the programme as sound. And no one
can regard it as sound without knowing it. There are of course many
persons who have never glanced at the programme, but who thrust
themselves into the communist ranks and swear by communism, simply
in the hope of snatching up some unconsidered trifle or of feathering
their nest. We have no use for such members, who can do us nothing but
harm. Without knowledge of the programme no one can be a genuine
communist bolshevik. Every intelligent Russian worker and poor
peasant ought to become acquainted with the programme of our party.
Every non-Russian proletarian ought to study it, that he may profit by
the experience of the Russian revolution.</P>

<a name="005"></a><h4>§5. The scientific character of our programme programme</h4>
<P>We have already said that it is wrong to manufacture a programme out
of our own heads, and that our programme should be taken from life.
Before the time of Marx, those who represented working-class interests
were apt to draw fancy pictures of a future paradise, without troubling
to ask themselves whether this paradise could ever be reached, and
without seeing the right road for the workers and peasants to follow.
Marx taught us another way. He examined the evil, unjust, barbaric
social order which still prevails throughout the world, and studied its
structure. Precisely after the manner in which we might study a
machine, or, let us say, a clock, did Marx study the structure of
capitalist society, in which factory owners and landowners rule, while
workers and peasants are oppressed. Let us suppose we have noticed
that two of the wheels of our clock are badly fitted, and that at each
revolution they interfere more and more with one another's movements.
Then we can foresee that the clock will break down and stop. What
Marx studied was not a clock, but capitalist society; he examined it
thoroughly, examined life under the dominion of capital. As the outcome
of his researches, Marx recognized very clearly that capitalism is digging
its own grave, that the machine will break down, and
that the cause of the break-down will be the inevitable uprising of the
workers, who will refashion the whole world to suit themselves.</P>

<P>Marx's chief instruction to all his followers was that they should study
life as it actually is. Thus only can a practical programme be drawn up.
It is self-evident, therefore, why our programme begins with a
description of the capitalist régime.</P>

<P>The capitalist régime has now been overthrown in Russia. What Marx
prophesied is being fulfilled under our very eyes. The old order is
collapsing. The crowns are falling from the heads of kings and emperors.
Everywhere the workers are advancing towards revolution, and towards
the establishment of soviet rule: In order fully to understand how all this
has come about, it is necessary to be thoroughly well acquainted with
the nature of the capitalist system. Then we shall realize that its
breakdown was inevitable. Once we grasp that there will be no return of
the old system and that the victory of the workers is assured, we shall
have full strength and confidence as we carry on the struggle on behalf of
the new social order of the workers.</P>
