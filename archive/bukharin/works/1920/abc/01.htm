    <H4>§ 6 Commodity economy</H4>
    
    <P>If we study how economic life is carried on under the capitalist régime,
      we see that its primary characteristic is the production of <I>commodities
      </I>. 'Well, what is there remarkable about that?' the reader may ask. The
      remarkable point is that a commodity is not simply a product, but
      something produced for the <I>market</I>.</P>
    
    <P>A product made for the producer himself, made for his own use, is not a
      commodity. When a peasant sows rye, gathers in the harvest, threshes it,
      mills the grain, and bakes bread for himself, this bread is certainly not
      a commodity; it is simply bread. It only becomes a commodity when it is
      bought and sold; when, that is to say, it is produced for a buyer, for the
      market. Whoever buys it, owns it.</P>
    
    <P>Under the capitalist system, all products are produced for the market,
      they all become commodities. Every factory or workshop produces in
      ordinary circumstances one particular product only, and it is easy to
      understand that the producer is not producing for his own use. When an
      undertaker, in his workshop, has coffins made, it is perfectly clear that
      he does not produce these coffins for himself and his family, but for the
      market. Again, in the case of a castor oil manufacturer, it is equally
      clear that even if the man continually suffers from digestive disorder it
      will be impossible for him to use for his own purposes more than an
      infinitesimal proportion of all the castor oil which his factory turns
      out. The same considerations apply, under capitalism, to any products you
      like to consider.</P>
    
    <P>In a button factory, buttons are made; but these millions of buttons are
      not produced in order that they may be sewn on to the manufacturer's
      waistcoat; they are for sale. Everything produced under the capitalist
      system is produced for the market. To this market come gloves and
      sausages; books and blacking; machines and whisky; bread, boots, and
      small-arms - in a word, everything that is made.</P>
    
    <P>A commodity economy necessarily implies <I>private ownership</I>. The
      independent artisan who produces commodities owns his workshop and his
      tools; the factory owner or workshop owner owns the factory or the
      workshop, with all the buildings, machinery, etc. Now, wherever private
      ownership and commodity production exist, there is a struggle for buyers,
      or competition among sellers. Even in the days before there were factory
      owners, workshop owners, and great capitalists, when there were only
      independent artisans, these artisans struggled one with another for
      buyers. The strongest and most acquisitive among them, the one who had the
      best tools and was the cleverest, especially the one who put by money, was
      always the one who came to the top, attracted custom, and ruined his
      rivals. Thus the system of petty ownership and the commodity economy that
      was based upon it, contained the germs of large-scale ownership and
      implied the ruin of many.</P>
    
    <P>WE SEE, THEREFORE, THAT THE PRIMARY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CAPITALIST
      SYSTEM IS A COMMODITY ECONOMY; THAT IS, AN ECONOMY WHICH PRODUCES FOR THE
      MARKET.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="007"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 7 Monopolization of the means of production by the capitalist
    class</H4>
    
    <P>The mere existence of a commodity economy does not alone suffice to
      constitute capitalism. A commodity economy can exist although there are no
      capitalists; for instance, the economy in which the only producers are
      independent artisans. They produce for the market, they sell their
      products; thus these products are undoubtedly commodities, and the whole
      production is commodity production. Nevertheless, this is not capitalist
      production; it is nothing more than <I>simple commodity production</I>.
      In order that a simple commodity economy can be transformed into
      capitalist production, it is necessary, on the one hand, that the means of
      production (tools, machinery, buildings, land, etc.) should become the
      private property of a comparatively limited class of wealthy capitalists;
      and, on the other, that there should ensue the ruin of most of the
      independent artisans and peasants and their conversion into wage workers.</P>
    
    <P>We have already seen that a simple commodity economy contains within
      itself the germs that will lead to the impoverishment of some and the
      enrichment of others. This is what has actually occurred. In all countries
      alike, most of the independent artisans and small masters have been
      ruined. The poorest were forced in the end to sell their tools; from
      'masters' they became 'men' whose sole possession was a pair of hands.
      Those on the other hand who were richer, grew more wealthy still; they
      rebuilt their workshops on a more extensive scale, installed new
      machinery, began to employ more workpeople, became factory owners.</P>
    
    <P>Little by little there passed into the hands of these wealthy persons
      all that was necessary for production: factory buildings, machinery, raw
      materials, warehouses and shops, dwelling houses, workshops, mines,
      railways, steamships, the land - in a word, all the means of production.
      All these means of production became the exclusive property of the
      capitalist class; they became, as the phrase runs, a 'monopoly' of the
      capitalist class.</P>
    
    <P>THE SMALL GROUP OF THE WEALTHY OWNS EVERYTHING; THE HUGE MASSES OF THE
      POOR OWN NOTHING BUT THE HANDS WITH WHICH THEY WORK. THIS MONOPOLY OF THE
      MEANS OF PRODUCTION BY THE CAPITALIST CLASS IS THE SECOND LEADING
      CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="008"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 8 Wage Labour</H4>
    
    <P>The vast numbers who were left without any property were transformed
      into the wage labourers of capital. What indeed was left for the
      impoverished peasant or artisan to do? Either take service as agricultural
      labourer under the capitalist landowner, or else go to the town and there
      seek employment in factory or workshop. There was no other way out. Such
      was the origin of wage labour, the third characteristic of the capitalist
      system.</P>
    
    <P>What is wage labour? In earlier days, when there were serfs or slaves,
      every serf or slave could be bought and sold. Persons with skin, hair,
      arms, and legs were the private property of their lord. The lord would
      flog one of his serfs to death in the stable as lightly as, in a drunken
      fit, he would break a stool or a chair. The serf or slave was merely a
      chattel. Among the ancient Romans, a master's property, all that was
      necessary for production, was classified as '<I>dumb </I>tools' (things),
      '<I>half-speaking </I>tools' (beasts of burden, sheep, cows, oxen, etc. -
      in a word, inarticulate animals), and '<I>speaking </I>tools' (slaves,
      human beings). A spade, an ox, a slave, were for the master all alike <I>tools
      </I>or <I>utensils</I>, which he could buy, sell, misuse, or destroy, at
      pleasure.</P>
    
    <P>The wage labourer can be neither bought nor sold. What can be bought and
      sold is his <I>labour power</I>; not the man or woman, but the capacity
      for labour. The wage labourer is personally free; the factory owner cannot
      flog him in the stable, or sell him to a neighbour, or exchange him for a
      wolf-hound puppy, though all these things could be done when serfdom
      prevailed. The wage worker can merely be hired. To all appearance the
      capitalist and the wage worker are equals. 'Don't work if you don't want
      to; there is no compulsion,' says the factory owner. The employer actually
      declares that he feeds the worker, gives work to the employee.</P>
    
    <P>As a matter of fact, however, the conditions are far from being the same
      for wage earner and capitalist. The workers are enchained by hunger.
      Hunger compels them to hire themselves out, that is, to sell their labour
      power. There is no other solution for the worker; he has no choice. With
      his hands alone he cannot produce 'his' product. Just try without tools
      and machinery to found steel, to weave, to build railway carriages. Under
      capitalism, the very land is all in private hands; there remains no spot
      unowned where an enterprise can be carried on. The freedom of the worker
      to sell his labour power, the freedom of the capitalist to buy it, the
      'equality' of the capitalist and the wage earner - all these are but
      hunger's chain which compels the labourer to work for the capitalist.</P>
    
    <P>In this manner, the essence of wage labour consists in the sale of
      labour power, or in the transformation of labour power into a commodity.
      In the simple commodity economy which was described in <A HREF="#006">§6</A>,
      there were to be found in the market: milk, bread, cloth, boots, etc.; but
      not labour power. Labour power was not for sale. Its possessor, the
      independent artisan, had in addition his own little dwelling and his
      tools. He worked for himself, conducted his own enterprise, applied his
      own labour power to the carrying of it on.</P>
    
    <P>Very different is it under capitalism. The worker no longer owns the
      means of production; he cannot make use of his labour power for the
      conduct of his own enterprise; if he would save himself from starvation,
      he must sell his labour power to the capitalist. Side by side with the
      markets where cotton, cheese, and machines are sold, there also comes into
      existence the <I>labour market </I>where proletarians, that is to say
      wage workers, sell their labour power.</P>
    
    <P>WE SEE, THEN, THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CAPITALIST ECONOMY AND THE
      SIMPLE COMMODITY ECONOMY CONSISTS IN THIS, THAT IN THE CAPITALIST ECONOMY
      LABOUR POWER ITSELF BECOMES A COMMODITY. THUS, THE THIRD CHARACTERISTIC OF
      THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM IS THE EXISTENCE OF WAGE LABOUR.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="009"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 9 Contradictions of production under capitalism</H4>
    
    <P>There are, therefore, three characteristics of the capitalist system,
      namely: production for the market (commodity production); the
      monopolization of the means of production by the capitalist class; wage
      labour, that is, labour founded upon the sale of labour power.</P>
    
    <P>All these characteristics are associated with the question, What are the
      mutual relationships between the individuals engaged in production and
      distribution? When we say 'commodity production' or 'production for the
      market', what does the phrase mean? It means that individuals work for one
      another, but that each produces for the market in his own enterprise, not
      knowing beforehand who will buy his wares. Let us suppose that there are
      an artisan named John and a peasant named George. John the artisan, a
      bootmaker, takes boots to the market and sells them to George, and with
      the money which George pays for them he buys bread from George. When John
      went to the market he did not know that he would meet George there, nor
      did George know that he would meet John; both men simply went to the
      market. When John bought the bread and George bought the boots, the result
      was that George had been working for John and John had been working for
      George, although the fact was not immediately obvious. The turmoil of the
      market place conceals from people that in actual fact they work for one
      another and cannot live without one another. In a commodity economy,
      people work for one another, but they do so in an unorganized manner and
      independently of each other, not knowing how necessary they are to one
      another. Consequently, in commodity production, individuals stand in
      definite relationships one to another, and what we are here concerned with
      is these mutual relationships.</P>
    
    <P>In like manner, when we speak of 'the monopolization of the means of
      production' or of 'wage labour', we are really talking about the
      relationships between individuals. What, in fact, does 'monopolization'
      signify? It signifies that persons work under such conditions that those
      who labour do so with means of production belonging to others; it
      signifies that the workers are subordinated to the owners of these means
      of production, namely to the capitalists. In a word, here also we are
      concerned with the question, What are the mutual relationships between
      individuals when they produce goods? The mutual relationships between
      individuals during the process of production are termed <I>the
      relationships of production</I>.</P>
    
    <P>It is easy to see that the relationships of production have not always
      been the same. Very long ago, when people lived in small communities, they
      worked together in comradely fashion (hunting, fishing, gathering fruit
      and roots), and they divided everything among themselves. Here we have one
      kind of relationships of production. In the days of slavery, the
      relationships of production were of another kind. Under capitalism there
      is a third kind of relationship. There are, therefore, various kinds of
      relationships of production. We speak of these kinds of relationships of
      production as the <I>economic systems </I>(types) of society or as the
      <I>methods of production</I>.</P>
    
    <P>'CAPITALIST RELATIONSHIPS OF PRODUCTION', OR IN OTHERS WORDS 'A
      CAPITALIST TYPE OF SOCIETY', OR 'THE CAPITALIST METHOD OF PRODUCTION'THESE
      TERMS EXPRESS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS IN A COMMODITY ECONOMY
      CHARACTERIZED BY THE MONOPOLY OWNERSHIP OF THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION ON THE
      PART OF A SMALL GROUP OF CAPITALISTS, AND CHARACTERIZED BY WAGE LABOUR ON
      THE PART OF THE WORKING CLASS.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="010"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 10 The exploitation of labour power</H4>
    
    <P>The question now arises, for what reason does the capitalist class hire
      workers? Everyone knows that the reason is by no means because the factory
      owners wish to feed the hungry workers, but because they wish <I>to
      extract profit from them</I>. For the sake of profit, the factory owner
      builds his factory; for the sake of profit, he engages workers; for the
      sake of profit, he is always nosing out where higher prices are paid.
      Profit is the motive of all his calculations. Herein, moreover, we discern
      a very interesting characteristic of capitalist society. For society does
      not itself produce the things which are necessary and useful to it;
      instead of this, the capitalist class compels the workers to produce those
      things for which more will be paid, those things from which the
      capitalists derive the largest profit. Whisky, for example, is a very
      harmful substance, and alcoholic liquors in general ought to be produced
      ;only for technical purposes and for their use in medicine. But throughout
      the world the capitalists produce alcohol with all their might. Why?
      Because to ply the people with drink is extremely profitable. </P>
    
    <P>We must now make it perfectly clear, how profit is made. For this
      purpose we must examine the question in detail. The capitalist receives
      profit in the form of money when he sells commodities that have been
      produced in his factory. How much money does he get for his wares? That
      depends upon the price. The next question is, How is the price determined,
      or why does one commodity fetch a high price and another a low price? It
      is easy to understand that if, in any branch of production, new machinery
      is introduced and labour is advantageously applied (or, as the phrase
      goes, is very productive), then the price of the commodity falls. If, on
      the other hand, production is difficult, if the quantity of goods produced
      is small, if labour is unsuccessfully applied or is comparatively
      unproductive, then the price of the commodity rises.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P>If society must expend on the average much labour in order to produce
      any article, the price of that article is high; if on the average little
      labour is required, the price of the article is low. Assuming average
      efficiency of manufacture (that is to say, when the machinery and tools
      employed are neither the very best nor the very worst), <I>the amount of
      social labour requisite for the production of a commodity is termed the
      value of that commodity</I>. We see that price depends upon value. In
      actual fact, price is sometimes higher than value and sometimes lower, but
      for simplicity we may here assume that they are one and the same.</P>
    
    <P>We must now recall what we said concerning the hiring of wage workers.
      The hiring of a worker is the sale of a peculiar commodity, the name of
      which is 'labour power'. As soon as labour power has become a commodity,
      what applies to other commodities applies to labour power. When the
      capitalist hires the worker, the former pays the latter the price of his
      labour power (or, to speak simply, the value of his labour power). By what
      is this value determined? We have seen that the value of all commodities
      is determined by the quantity of labour expended in producing them. The
      same thing applies to labour power.</P>
    
    <P>What, however, do we mean by the production of labour power? Labour
      power is not indeed produced in a factory, like cloth, blacking, or
      machinery. How then are we to explain it? We have merely to look at
      contemporary life under capitalism in order to understand with what we are
      concerned. Let us suppose that the workers have just finished their day's
      work. They are tired out, all their vital energy has been used up, they
      cannot work any more. Their labour power is practically exhausted. What is
      needed to restore it? Food, rest, sleep, recuperation, and therewith
      strength will be restored. Then will reappear the capacity for work; then,
      once more, they will have labour power. This means that food, clothing,
      and shelter - in a word, the necessaries that the worker consumes - affect
      the production of his labour power. Additional elements have to be
      considered, such as expenditure upon training when skilled workers are
      needed, and so on.</P>
    
    <P>Everything that the working class consumes in order to restore its
      labour power, has value. For this reason, the value of articles of
      consumption and also of expenditure upon training constitute the value of
      labour power. Different commodities possess different values. In like
      manner, each kind of labour power has its peculiarvalue. The labour power
      of the compositor has one value, the labour power of the unskilled
      labourer has another.</P>
    
    <P>Let us now return to the factory. The capitalist buys raw materials,
      fuel, machinery, lubricants, and other necessaries; then he buys labour
      power, 'engages hands'. He pays cash for everything. The work of
      production begins. The workers work, the wheels turn, the fuel is burned,
      the lubricant is used, the factory buildings suffer wear and tear, the
      labour power is expended. As a result, there issues from the factory a new
      commodity. The commodity, like all commodities, has value. What is this
      value? First of all, the commodity has absorbed into itself the value of
      the means of production that have been used up; that which has passed into
      it - raw materials, fuel consumed, the worn parts of the machinery, and so
      on. All this has now been transformed into the value of the commodity. In
      the second place, there has passed into the commodity the labour of the
      workers. If the workers were 30 in number, and if in the production of the
      commodity each worked for 30 hours, then there will have been expended in
      all goo working hours. The full value of the product will therefore
      consist of the value of the utilized materials (let us assume that the
      value of these is equivalent to Goo hours), together with the new value
      which the workers have added by their labour, namely goo hours. The total
      is therefore 600+900=1500 working hours.</P>
    
    <P>But how much did the commodity cost the capitalist? For the raw
      materials he paid in full; that is to say, he paid a sum of money
      corresponding to the value of boo working hours. But what did he pay for
      labour power? Did he pay for the whole goo hours? Here lies the key to the
      riddle. By our hypothesis, he has paid the full value of the labour power
      for the working days. If 30 workers have worked 30 hours, three days for
      10 hours a day, the factory owner will have paid them whatever sum was
      necessary for the recuperation of their labour power during these days.
      How much will this sum have been? The answer is plain; it will have been
      considerably less than goo. Why? Because the quantity of labour which is
      necessary to recuperate my labour power is one thing, whereas the quantity
      of labour which I am able to expend is another thing. I can work 10 hours
      a day. To provide a sufficiency of food, clothing, etc., my daily needs
      are a quantity of articles the total value of which is equal to 5 hours.
      That is to say, I can do more work than the work which is requisite to
      recuperate my labour power. In our example, the workers consume, let us
      say, in the form of food, clothing, etc., during the three days, articles
      to the value of 4.50 working hours; but they supply goo hours of labour.
      There remain for the capitalist 450 hours; these form the source of his
      profit. In fact, the commodity has cost the capitalist, as we have seen,
      600+450=1050 hours; but he sells it for the value of 600+900=1500 hours;
      450 hours are <I>surplus value </I>created by labour power. It results
      that for half their working time (namely for 5 hours in a ten-hour working
      day) the workers are working to redintegrate what they have used up for
      themselves; but during the other half of the day they are working entirely
      for the capitalist.</P>
    
    <P>Let us now consider society as a whole. What the individual factory
      owner or the individual worker does is of very little interest to us. What
      interests us is the structure of the huge machine which goes by the name
      of capitalist society. The capitalist class hires the working class, the
      latter being numerically of enormous size. In millions of factories, in
      mines and quarries, in forest and field, hundreds of millions of workers
      labour like ants. Capital pays them their wages, the value of their labour
      power, with which they unceasingly renew this labour power for the service
      of capital. By its labour, the working class does not merely pay its own
      wages, but it creates in addition the income of the upper classes, creates
      surplus value. Through a thousand runnels, this surplus value flows into
      the pockets of the master class. Part goes to the capitalist himself, in
      the form of entrepreneur's profit; part goes to the landowner; in the form
      of taxes, part enters the coffers of the capitalist State; other portions
      accrue to merchants, traders, and shopkeepers, are spent upon churches and
      in brothels, support actors, artists, bourgeois scribblers, and so on.
      Upon surplus value live all the parasites who are bred by the capitalist
      system.</P>
    
    <P>Part of the surplus value is, however, used over again by the
      capitalists. They add it to their capital, and the capital grows. They
      extend their enterprises. They engage more workers. They instal better
      machinery. The increased number of workers produces for them a still
      greater quality of surplus value. The capitalist enterprises grow ever
      larger. Thus at each revolution of time, capital moves forward, heaping up
      surplus value. Squeezing surplus value out of the working class, <I>exploiting
      </I>the workers, capital continually increases in size.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="011"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 11 Capital</H4>
    
    <P>We now see clearly what capital is. Before all else, it is a definite
      value: it may be in the form of money; it may be in the form of machinery,
      raw materials, or factory buildings; it may be in the form of finished
      commodities. But it is value of such a kind as serves for the production
      of new value, for the production of surplus value. WHICH PRODUCES SURPLUS
      VALUE. CAPITALIST PRODUCTION IS THE PRODUCTION OF SURPLUS VALUE.</P>
    
    <P>In capitalist society, machinery and factory buildings take the form of
      capital. But do machinery and buildings always take the form of capital?
      Certainly not. If the whole of society were a cooperative commonwealth
      producing everything for itself, then neither machinery nor raw materials
      would be capital, seeing that they would not be means for the creation of
      profit for a small group of rich persons. That is to say, machinery, for
      example, only becomes capital when it is the private property of the
      capitalist class, when it serves the purpose .of exploiting wage labour,
      when it serves to produce surplus value. The <I>form </I>of the value is
      here unimportant. The value may be in the form of gold coins or paper
      money, with which the capitalist buys the means of production and labour
      power. It may be in the form of the machines with which the workers work;
      or of the raw materials out of which they make commodities; or of the
      finished articles which will subsequently be sold. If, however, this value
      serves for the production of surplus value, it is capital.</P>
    
    <P>As a rule capital is continually assuming new aspects. Let us study how
      these transformations take place.</P>
    
    <P>I. The capitalist has not yet bought labour power or the means of
      production. He is, however, eager to engage workers, to procure machinery,
      to obtain raw materials of the best quality, to get a sufficient supply of
      coal, and so on. As yet, he has nothing except money. Here we have capital
      in its <I>monetary form</I>.</P>
    
    <P>II. With this supply of money the capitalist makes his way to the market
      - not of course in his own person, since he has the telephone, the
      telegraph, and a hundred servants. Here takes place the purchase of the
      means of production and of labour power. The capitalist returns to the
      factory without money, but with workers, machinery, raw materials, and
      fuel. These things are now no longer commodities. They have ceased to be
      commodities; they are not for sale. The money has been transformed into
      means of production and into labour power. The monetary wrapping has been
      cast aside; the capital has assumed <I>the form of industrial capital</I>.</P>
    
    <P>Now the work begins. The machinery is set in motion, the wheels turn,
      the levers move to and fro, the workers drip with sweat, the machinery
      undergoes wear and tear, the raw materials are used up, the labour power
      is tired out.</P>
    
    <P>III. Thereupon, all the raw material, the wear and tear of the machines,
      the labour power, undergo a gradual transformation into masses of
      commodities. Thus the capital assumes a new guise; its factory embodiment
      vanishes, and it takes the form of quantities of commodities. We have
      capital in its <I>commodity form</I>. But now, when production is
      completed, the capital has not merely changed its wrapping. It has
      increased in value, for in the course of production there has been added
      to it surplus value.</P>
    
    <P>IV. In production, the aim of the capitalist is not to provide goods for
      his own use, but to produce commodities for the market, for sale. That
      which was stored up in his warehouse, must be sold. At first the
      capitalist went to market as a buyer. Now he has to go there as a seller.
      At first he had money in his hands, and he wanted to buy commodities (the
      means of production). Now he has commodities in his hands, and he wants to
      get money. When these commodities are sold, capital jumps back from its
      commodity form into its monetary form. But the quantity of money which the
      capitalist receives differs from the quantity which he originally paid
      out, <I>inasmuch as it is greater by the whole amount of the surplus
      value</I>.</P>
    
    <P>This, however, does not end the movement of capital. The enlarged
      capital is set in motion once again, and acquires a still larger quantity
      of surplus value. This surplus value is in part added to capital, and
      begins a new cycle. Capital rolls on like a snowball, and at each
      revolution there adheres to it a larger quantity of surplus value. The
      result of this is that capitalist production continually expands.</P>
    
    <P>Thus capital sucks surplus value out of the working class and everywhere
      extends its dominion. Its peculiarities account for its rapid growth. The
      exploitation of one class by another took place in earlier days. Let us
      consider, for example, a landowner when serfdom prevailed, or a
      slave-owner in classical antiquity. They lived on the backs of their serfs
      and slaves. But all which the workers produced, the landowners and
      slaveowners ate, drank, and wore - either themselves, or else their
      servants and their numerous hangers-on. At that time there was very little
      commodity production. There was no market. If the landowner or slaveowner
      had compelled his serfs or slaves to produce vast quantities of bread,
      meat, fish, etc., all this would simply have rotted. Production was
      restricted to the gratification of the animal needs of the landowner and
      his household. It is very different under capitalism. Here production
      takes place, not for the gratification of immediate needs, but for profit.
      Under capitalism, the commodity is produced for sale, for the sake of
      gain, in order that profits may be heaped up. The larger the profit, the
      better. Hence the mad hunt for profit on the part of the capitalist class.
      This greed knows no limits. It is the pivot, the prime motive, of
      capitalist production.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="012"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 12 The capitalist state</H4>
    
    <P>As we have seen, capitalist society is based upon the exploitation of
      labour. A small minority owns everything; the working masses own nothing.
      The capitalists command. The workers obey. The capitalists exploit. The
      workers are exploited. The very essence of capitalist society is found in
      this merciless and ever-increasing exploitation.</P>
    
    <P>Capitalist production is a practical instrument for the extraction of
      surplus value.</P>
    
    <P>Why has this instrument been able to continue in operation so long? For
      what reason do the workers tolerate such a state of affairs?</P>
    
    <P>This question is by no means easy to answer at first sight. Speaking
      generally there are two reasons for it: in the first place, because the
      capitalist class is well organized and powerful; secondly, because the
      bourgeoisie frequently controls the brains of the working class.</P>
    
    <P>The most trustworthy means at the disposal of the bourgeoisie for this
      purpose is its organization as the State. In all capitalist countries the
      State is merely a union of the master class. Let us consider any country
      you like: Britain, the United States, France, or Japan. Everywhere we find
      that the ministers, high officials, members of parliament, are either
      capitalists, landowners, factory owners, and financial magnates, or else
      the faithful and well-paid servants of these-lawyers, bank managers,
      professors, army officers, archbishops, and bishops, who serve the
      capitalists, not from fear but from conviction.</P>
    
    <P>The union of all these individuals belonging to the bourgeoisie, a union
      which embraces the entire country and holds everything in its grasp, is
      known as the State. This organization of the bourgeoisie has two leading
      aims. The first and most important of these is to suppress disorders and
      insurrections on the part of the workers, to ensure the undisturbed
      extraction of surplus value from the working class, to increase the
      strength of the capitalist means of production. The second aim is to
      strive against other organizations of the same kind (that is to say,
      against other bourgeois States), to compete with them for a larger share
      in surplus value. Thus the capitalist State is a union of the master
      class, formed to safeguard exploitation. The interests of capital and
      nothing but the interests of capital - here we have the guiding star
      towards which are directed all the activities of this robber band.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Against such a view of the bourgeois State, the
      following considerations might be adduced.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">You say that the State is exclusively run in the
      interests of capital. Consider this point, however. In all capitalist
      countries there is factory legislation forbidding or restricting child
      labour, limiting the working day, and so on. In Germany, for example, in
      the days of William II, there prevailed a fairly good system of State
      insurance for the workers. In England, the typically bourgeois minister
      Lloyd George introduced the Insurance Act and the Old-Age Pensions Act. In
      all bourgeois lands, there are hospitals, dispensaries, and sanatoriums
      for the workers; railways are constructed, and by these all can travel,
      rich and poor alike; waterworks are instituted for the supply of the
      towns, and so on. Such things are for the public service. This implies,
      many will say, that even in those countries where capital rules, the State
      is not run solely in the interests of capital, but is concerned likewise
      with the interests of the workers. The State actually punishes factory
      owners who infringe factory legislation.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">These arguments are fallacious, for the following
      reasons. It is perfectly true that the bourgeois authority occasionally
      passes laws and regulations useful to the working class. They are,
      however, passed in the interest of the bourgeoisie. Let us take as an
      example the railways. The workers travel by them, and for this reason they
      are useful to the workers. But they are not built for the sake of the
      workers. Merchants and factory owners need railways for the carriage of
      their wares, for the transport of troops, for the conveyance of workers,
      etc. Capital needs railways, and builds them in its own interest. They are
      useful to the workers too, but that is not why the capitalist State
      constructs them. Again, let us take the cleaning of the towns, or urban
      sanitation as it is called, and let us consider the hospitals. In these
      cases the bourgeoisie is concerned about the working-class districts as
      well as about the others. It is true that, in comparison with the
      bourgeois quarters in the centre of the town, we find, in the
      working-class suburbs, dirt, the abomination of desolation, disease, etc.
      Nevertheless, the bourgeoisie does do something. Why? Because illness and
      epidemics sometimes spread all through the town, and if such a thing
      should happen the bourgeoisie, too, would suffer. In this matter,
      therefore, the bourgeois State and its urban instruments are simply
      pursuing bourgeois interests.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Here is another example. During the nineteenth century,
      the French workers learned from the bourgeoisie the practice of birth
      control. By artificial means they arranged either to have no children at
      all or no more than two children. The povertyof theworkers was so great
      that to rear a larger family was difficult or almost impossible. As a
      result of this practice, the population of France remained nearly
      stationary. The French bourgeoisie began to be short of soldiers. A
      clamour was raised: 'The nation is perishing! The Germans are increasing
      more rapidly than we are! They will have more soldiers!' It may be
      remarked in passing that year by year those who were called up for
      military service proved less and less fit; they were shorter, had a
      smaller chest measurement, were more weakly. And now, behold, the
      bourgeoisie grew 'freehanded'; it began to insist upon improved conditions
      for the working class, in order that the workers might rear more children.
      Undoubtedly, if you kill the hen, you will not get any more eggs.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In all these cases, the bourgeoisie has certainly taken
      steps useful to the workers; but it has done so solely in its own
      interests. In many instances, however, measures useful to the workers have
      been inaugurated by the bourgeois State owing to the pressure of the
      working class. Nearly all the factory laws were secured in such a manner,
      in consequence of threats on the part of the workers. In England, the
      first legal limitation of the working day (to 10 hours) was brought about
      by working-class pressure. In Russia, the tsarist government passed the
      first factory laws owing to its alarm on account of disorders and strikes
      among the workers. In these matters the State, which consists of the
      enemies of the working class, the State, which is an <I>economic
      organization</I>, reckons up its own interests, saying: 'It is better to
      yield a certain amount today than to yield twice as much tomorrow; and it
      is better to yield than to risk one's skin.' The factory owner who yields
      to the demands of his workers on strike and concedes them an extra
      halfpenny, does not cease to be a factory owner; nor does the bourgeois
      State in any way lose its bourgeois characteristics when it makes some
      small concession owing to working-class pressure.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The capitalist State is not only the largest and most powerful among
      bourgeois organizations; it is at the same time the most complex of these
      organizations, for it has a very large number of subdivisions, and
      tentacles issue from these in every direction. The primary aim of all this
      is to protect, to consolidate, and to expand the exploitation of the
      working class. Against the working class, the State can employ measures of
      two different kinds, brute force and spiritual subjugation. These
      constitute the most important instruments of the capitalist State.</P>
    
    <P>Among the organs of <I>brute force</I>, must first be enumerated the
      army and the police, the prisons and the law-courts. Next must be
      mentioned accessory organs, such as spies, provocative agents, organized
      strikebreakers, hired assassins, etc.</P>
    
    <P>The <I>army </I>of the capitalist State is organized in a peculiar
      fashion. At the head is the officers' corps, the group of 'epaulet
      wearers'. They are drawn from the ranks of the landed gentry, from those
      of the wealthier bourgeoisie, and in part from those of the intelligentsia
      (professional classes). These are the bitterest enemies of the
      proletariat. From childhood they have been brought up in special schools
      (in Russia in cadet corps and in junker schools) where they have been
      taught how to knock the men about, and how ' to maintain the honour of the
      uniform', this meaning to keep the rankers in absolute subjection and to
      make mere pawns of them. The most distinguished members of the nobility
      and the wealthier bourgeoisie, if they enter the military or naval
      profession, become generals or admirals, persons of high rank, wearing
      orders and ribbons.</P>
    
    <P>Nor are the officers ever drawn from among the poor. They have the mass
      of common soldiers entirely in their hands. These latter are so completely
      under the influence of their environment that they never ask what they are
      fighting for, but simply keep their ears cocked for orders. Such an army
      is primarily intended to hold the workers in check.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In <I>Russia</I>, the tsarist army was repeatedly used
      to keep down the workers and peasants. During the reign of Alexander II,
      before the liberation of the serfs, there were numerous risings of the
      peasantry, and these were all suppressed by the army. In the year 1905,
      the army shot down the workers during the Moscow rising; it carried out
      punitive expeditions in the Baltic provinces, in the Caucasus, and in
      Siberia; in the years 1906-8, it suppressed peasant risings and protected
      the property of the landowners. During the war, the army shot down the
      workers at Ivanovo-Voznesensk, at Kostroma, and elsewhere. The officers
      were especially ruthless. Foreign armies behave in just the same way. In
      <I>Germany</I>, the army of the capitalist State has likewise been used
      to keep the workers down. The first naval rising was suppressed by the
      army. Risings of the workers in Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, all over Germany,
      were crushed by the army. In <I>France</I>, the army has frequently shot
      down strikers; quite recently it has shot the workers, and also a number
      of Russian revolutionary soldiers. In the <I>British Empire</I>, in quite
      recent days, the army has frequently crushed risings of the Irish workers,
      risings of the Egyptian fellahin, risings in India; in England itself, the
      soldiers have attacked great meetings of the workers. In <I>Switzerland</I>,
      during every strike, the machine-gun corps is mobilized and the socalled
      militia (the Swiss army) is summoned to the colours; so far, however, the
      militia has not fired on the proletarians. In the <I>United States</I>,
      the army has frequently burned working-class settlements and has razed
      houses to the ground (for instance, during the strike in Colorado). The
      armies of the capitalist States are today combining to strangle the
      workers' revolutions in Russia, Hungary, the Balkans, and Germany; they
      are crushing revolts all over the world.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The <I>police </I>and the <I>gendarmerie</I>. In addition to the
      regular army, the capitalist State has an army of picked ruffians, and of
      specially trained troops, peculiarly adapted for the struggle with the
      workers. These institutions (the police, for instance) have, indeed, the
      function of combating theft and of 'protecting the persons and property of
      citizens'; but at the same time the police are maintained for the arrest,
      prosecution, and punishment, of discontented workers. In Russia, the
      police have been the most trustworthy protectors of the landlords and the
      tsar. Especially brutal, in all capitalist countries, have been the
      members of the secret police and of the corps of gendarmes - in Russia the
      secret police force or 'political police' was known as the <I>ohrana </I>(protection).
      Large numbers of detectives, provocative agents, spies, strikebreakers,
      etc., work in cooperation with the official police.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Interesting, in this connexion, are the methods of the
      American secret police. They are in league with a vast number of private
      and semi-official 'detective bureaux'. The notorious adventures of Nat
      Pinkerton were really a campaign against the workers. The detectives
      palmed off bombs on the workers' leaders, incited them to kill the
      capitalists, and so forth. Such 'detectives' likewise recruit vast numbers
      of strikebreakers (known in the United States as 'scabs'), and troops of
      armed ruffians who murder strikers when opportunity arises. There is no
      villainy too black for these assassins, who are employed by the
      'democratic' State of the American capitalists!</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The <I>administration of justice </I>in the bourgeois State is a means
      of self-defence for the bourgeois class. Above all, it is employed to
      settle with those who infringe the rights of capitalist property or
      interfere with the capitalist system. Bourgeois justice sent Liebknecht to
      prison, but acquitted Liebknecht's murderer. The <I>State prison service
      </I>settles accounts quite as effectively as does the executioner of the
      bourgeois State. Its shafts are directed, not against the rich, but
      against the poor.</P>
    
    <P>Such are the institutions of the capitalist State, institutions which
      effect the direct and brutal oppression of the working class.</P>
    
    <P>Among the means of <I>spiritual subjugation </I>at the disposal of the
      capitalist State, three deserve especial mention: the State school; the
      State church; and the State, or State-supported, press.</P>
    
    <P>The bourgeoisie is well aware that it cannot control the working masses
      by the use of force alone. It is necessary that the workers' brains should
      be completely enmeshed as if in a spider's web. The bourgeois State looks
      upon the workers as working cattle; these beasts must labour, but they
      must not bite. Consequently, they must not merely be whipped or shot when
      they attempt to bite, but they must be trained and tamed, just as wild
      beasts in a menagerie are trained by beast-tamers. Similarly, the
      capitalist State maintains specialists to stupefy and subdue the
      proletariat; it maintains bourgeois teachers and professors, the clergy,
      bourgeois authors and journalists. In the State schools these specialists
      teach children from their earliest years to obey capital and to despise
      and hate 'rebels'. The children's heads are stuffed with fables about the
      revolution and the revolutionary movement. Emperors, kings, and industrial
      magnates are glorified. In the churches, the priests, who are salaried by
      the State, preach that all authority comes from God. Day after day, the
      bourgeois newspapers trumpet these lies, whilst workingclass papers are in
      most cases suppressed by the capitalist State. Under such conditions, is
      'it easy for the workers to extract themselves from the quagmire? A German
      imperialist bandit wrote: ' We do not only need the soldiers' legs, but
      also their brains and their hearts.' The bourgeois State, in like manner,
      aims at educating the workers so that they may resemble domestic animals
      who will work like horses, and eat humble pie.</P>
    
    <P>In this manner the capitalist system ensures its own development. The
      machine of exploitation does its work. Surplus value is continually
      extracted from the working class. The capitalist State stands on guard,
      and takes good care that there shall be no uprising of the wage slaves.</P>

    <H4>§ 13 Fundamental contraictions of the capitalist system</H4>
    
    <P>We must now examine whether capitalist or bourgeois society is well or
      ill constructed. Anything is sound and good when the mutual adaptation of
      its parts is entirely satisfactory. Let us consider the mechanism of a
      clock. It works accurately and freely if all the cog-wheels are properly
      adjusted one to another.</P>
    
    <P>Let us now look at capitalist society. We can perceive without
      difficulty that capitalist society is far less soundly constructed than it
      appears to be at the first glance. On the contrary, it exhibits grave
      contradictions and disastrous flaws. In the first place, under capitalism
      the production and distribution of goods is quite unorganized; 'anarchy of
      production' prevails. What does this mean? It means that all the
      capitalist entrepreneurs (or capitalist companies) produce commodities
      independently of one another. Instead of society undertaking to reckon up
      what it needs and how much of each article, the factory owners simply
      produce upon the calculation of what will bring them most profit and will
      best enable them to defeat their rivals in the market. The consequence
      often is that commodities are produced in excessive quantities - we are
      talking, of course, of pre-war days. There is then no sale for them. The
      workers cannot buy them, for they have not enough money. Thereupon a
      crisis ensues. The factories are shut down, and the workers are turned out
      into the street. Furthermore, the anarchy of production entails a struggle
      for the market; each producer wants to entice away the others' customers,
      to corner the market. This struggle assumes various forms: it begins with
      the competition between two factory owners; it ends in the world war,
      wherein the capitalist States wrestle with one another for the world
      market. This signifies, not merely that the parts of capitalist society
      interfere with one another's working, but that there is a direct conflict
      between the constituent parts.</P>
    
    <P>THE FIRST REASON, THEREFORE, FOR THE DISHARMONY OF CAPITALIST SOCIETY IS
      THE ANARCHY OF PRODUCTION, WHICH LEADS TO CRISES, INTERNECINE COMPETITION,
      AND WARS.</P>
    
    <P>THE SECOND REASON FOR THE DISHARMONY OF CAPITALIST SOCIETY IS TO BE
      FOUND IN THE CLASS STRUCTURE OF THAT SOCIETY. Considered in its essence,
      capitalist society is not one society but two societies; it consists of
      capitalists, on the one hand, and of workers and poor peasants, on the
      other. Between these two classes there is continuous and irreconcilable
      enmity; this is what we speak of as the <I>class war</I>. Here, also, we
      see that the various parts of capitalist society are not merely
      ill-adapted to one another, but are actually in unceasing conflict.</P>
    
    <P>Is capitalism going to collapse, or is it not? The answer to the
      question depends upon the following considerations. If we study the
      evolution of capitalism, if we examine the changes it has undergone in the
      course of time, and if we perceive that its disharmonies are diminishing,
      then we can confidently wish it a long life. If, on the other hand, we
      discover that in the course of time the various parts of the capitalist
      machine have come to clash with one another more and more violently, if we
      discern that the flaws in the structure are becoming positive chasms, then
      it is time to say, 'Rest in peace'.</P>
    
    <P>We have now, therefore, to study the evolution of capitalism.</P>

      We are now speaking of a change of price without reference to money,
      without reference to the question whether there be much money or little,
      or whether the currency be gold or paper: Changes in price due to changes
      in the standard of value may be very large, but such changes affect all
      commodities simultaneously, and this does not explain the differences in
      price as between one commodity and another. For example, the great
      extension of paper currency has enormously inflated prices in all
      countries. But this universal dearness does not explain why one commodity
      should be dearer than another.</P>
