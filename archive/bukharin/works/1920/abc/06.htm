    <H3>Chapter 6: The Soviet Power</H3>
    
    <H4><A NAME="046"></A>§ 46 The Soviet Power as a form of proletarian
    dictatorship</H4>
    
    <P>Our party was the first to formulate and the first to realize the demand
      for Soviet Power. The great revolution of November 1917, was carried
      through under the watchword, 'All power to the soviets!' Until our party
      took the phrase as its device, the slogan had never been heard of. Not
      that the notion simply sprang out of our heads! Far from this being the
      case, the idea was engendered at the very core of life. As early as the
      revolution of 1905-6, class organizations of the workers, known as soviets
      of workers' delegates, came into existence. In the revolution of 1917,
      these organizations appeared in far greater abundance; almost everywhere
      there sprouted like mushrooms workers' soviets, soldiers' soviets, and
      subsequently peasants' soviets. It became clear that these soviets, which
      had originated as instruments for use in the struggle for power, must
      inevitably be transformed into the instruments for the wielding of power.</P>
    
    <P>Prior to the Russian revolution of 1917, much had been said and written
      concerning the dictatorship of the proletariat, but no one clearly
      understood in what form this dictatorship would be realized. Now, in the
      Russian revolution, the form of the dictatorship has become manifest as
      the Soviet Power. THE SOVIET POWER IS THE REALIZATION OF THE DICTATORSHIP
      OF THE PROLETARIAT, ORGANIZED IN ITS SOVIETS AS THE RULING CLASS, AND,
      WITH THE AID OF THE PEASANTS, CRUSHING THE RESISTANCE OF THE BOURGEOISIE
      AND THE LANDLORDS.</P>
    
    <P>At one time most people believed that the dictatorship of the
      proletariat would be possible in the form of a so-called democratic
      republic, which would have to be established by the Constituent Assembly,
      and which would be administered by a parliament representing all classes
      of the population. Even now, the opportunists and the social solidarians
      continue to hold the same opinion, declaring that only the Constituent
      Assembly and a democratic republic can save the country from the disasters
      of civil war. Actual experience tells a very different tale. In Germany,
      for instance, such a republic was set up after the revolution of November,
      1918. Nevertheless, during the close of 1918 and during 1919 there were
      sanguinary struggles. Continually the working class was demanding the
      establishment of a soviet régime. The demand for a soviet régime
      has in fact become the international watchword of the proletariat. In all
      countries the workers sound this war-cry, in conjunction with the demand
      for the dictatorship of the proletariat. Life has confirmed the accuracy
      of our slogan, 'All power to the soviets', not in Russia alone, but in
      every country where there is a proletariat.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="047"></A>§ 47 Proletarian democracy and bourgeois
    democracy</H4>
    
    <P>A bourgeois democratic republic is based upon universal suffrage and
      upon the so-called 'will of the people', the 'will of the whole nation',
      the 'united will of all classes'. The advocates of a bourgeois democratic
      republic, of a Constituent Assembly, etc., tell us that we are doing
      violence to the united will of the nation. Let us consider this matter
      first.</P>
    
    <P>In Part One we learned that contemporary society consists of classes
      with conflicting interests. For example, long working hours may be
      profitable to the bourgeoisie, but they are disadvantageous to the working
      class. Peace between the classes is as impossible as peace between wolves
      and sheep. Wolves want to eat sheep, so sheep must defend themselves
      against wolves. But if this be so (and unquestionably it is so), then we
      have to ask whether it is possible for wolves and sheep to have a common
      will. Every intelligent person knows that it is absurd to talk of anything
      of the kind. There simply cannot be a will common to sheep and wolves. We
      must have one thing or the other: either a wolves' will, that of those who
      enslave the cheated and oppressed sheep; or else a sheep's will, that of
      those who wish to deliver the sheep from the wolves and to drive out the
      plunderers. There can be no middle course in this matter. Now, it is as
      clear as daylight that the same thing applies to the two main classes of
      human society. In contemporary society, class is arrayed against class,
      the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, the proletariat against the
      bourgeoisie. Between them there is a war to the knife. How can they
      possibly have a common will, a bourgeois-proletarian will? Obviously there
      is no more possibility of bourgeois- proletarian desires and aspirations
      than of wolf-sheep desires and aspirations. We can either have the will of
      the bourgeoisie, of the class which imposes its will in various ways upon
      the oppressed majority of the people; or else we can have the will of the
      proletariat, of the class which imposes its will upon the bourgeoisie. It
      is particularly stupid to speak of a will common to all classes, of
      interests common to the whole nation, in an epoch of civil war, in a
      period of revolution, when the old world is crumbling to pieces. The
      proletariat wants to transform the world; the bourgeoisie wants to
      strengthen the old slavery.</P>
    
    <P>How can there be a 'common' will for bourgeoisie and proletariat? It is
      manifest that the very phrase about a will common to the whole nation is
      humbug if the words are intended to apply to all classes. No such common
      will has been realized or can be realized.</P>
    
    <P>But this fraud is necessary to the bourgeoisie, necessary for the
      maintenance of capitalist rule. The capitalists are in the minority. They
      cannot venture to say openly that this small minority rules. This is why
      the bourgeoisie has to cheat, declaring that it rules in the name of 'the
      whole people', 'all classes', 'the entire nation', and so on.</P>
    
    <P>How is the fraud carried out in a 'democratic republic'? The chief
      reason why the proletariat is enslaved today is because it is <I>economically</I>
      enslaved. Even in a democratic republic, the factories and workshops
      belong to the capitalists, and the land belongs to the capitalists and the
      landlords. The worker has nothing but his labour power; the poor peasant
      has nothing beyond a tiny scrap of land. They are eternally compelled to
      labour under terrible conditions, for they are under the heel of the
      master. On paper, they can do a great deal; in actual fact, they can do
      nothing. They can do nothing because all the wealth, all the power of
      capital, is in the hands of their enemies. This is what is termed <I>bourgeois
      democracy</I>.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Bourgeois republics exist in the United States, in
      Switzerland, and in France. But all these countries are ruled by
      unscrupulous imperialists, by the trust kings and the bank barons,
      malignant enemies of the working class. The most democratic republic which
      existed in the year 1919 was the German Republic with its National
      Assembly. Yet this was the republic to which the murderers of Karl
      Liebknecht belonged.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The Soviet Power realizes a new, a much more perfect type of democracy -
      <I>proletarian democracy</I>. The essence of this proletarian democracy
      consists in this, that it <I>is based upon the transference of the means
      of production into the hands of the workers</I>, thus depriving the
      bourgeoisie of all power. In proletarian democracy, those who formerly
      constituted the oppressed masses, and their organizations, have become the
      instruments of rule. In the capitalist system of society, and therefore in
      bourgeois democratic republics, there existed organizations of workers and
      peasants. They were, however, overwhelmed by the organizations of the
      rich. Under proletarian democracy, on the other hand, the rich have been
      deprived of their wealth. The mass organizations of the workers, the
      semi-proletarian peasants, etc. (soviets, trade unions, factory
      committees, etc.), have become the actual foundations of the proletarian
      State authority. In the constitution of the Soviet Republic we find at the
      outset the statement: 'Russia declares itself to be a republic of
      workers', soldiers', and peasants' delegates. All power, both central and
      local, is vested in these soviets.'</P>
    
    <P>Soviet democracy does not merely not exclude the workers' organizations
      from government, but it actually makes of them the instruments of
      government. But since the soviets and the other organizations of the
      working class and the peasantry number their members by the million, the
      Soviet Power entrusts with new functions innumerable masses of persons who
      were formerly oppressed and degraded. To an ever greater extent the masses
      of the people, the workers and the poor peasants, come to participate in
      the joint labours of the soviets, the trade unions, and the factory
      committees. This is going on everywhere. In the country towns and in the
      villages, people who never did anything of the kind before are now
      actively participating in the work of administration and in the upbuilding
      of a new life. In this way the Soviet Power secures the widest
      self-government for the various localities, and at the same time summons
      the broad masses of the people to participate in the work of government.</P>
    
    <P>It is evident that our party must devote itself to promoting the
      world-wide development of this new proletarian democracy. We must do our
      utmost to secure that the widest strata of the proletarians and the poor
      peasants shall participate to the utmost of their power in the work of the
      soviets. In one of his pamphlets, published before the November
      revolution, Comrade Lenin wrote very truly that our task was to see that
      every cook should be taught to take her share in governmental
      administration. Of course this is by no means an easy job, and there are
      many hindrances to its realization. First among such obstacles comes the
      low cultural level of the masses. The workers' vanguard is but a small
      body. In this vanguard, the metal workers, for instance, are conspicuous.
      But a large proportion of the workers are backward, and this is especially
      true of the country districts. They lack initiative, they lack creative
      faculty; they stand aside and let others take the first steps. The task of
      our party consists in the systematic and gradual attraction of these
      backward strata to participate in the general work of administration. Of
      course the only way of bringing new strata to participate in the work is
      to raise their cultural level and their capacity for organization. This,
      likewise, is the task of our party.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="048"></A>§ 48 The class character and the transitoryness
    of the proletarian</H4>
    
    <P>The bourgeoisie has everywhere concealed its class rule behind the mask
      of 'the cause of the whole people'. How could the bourgeoisie, a
      comparatively small group of parasites, openly acknowledge that it imposes
      its class will upon all? How could the bourgeoisie venture to declare that
      the State is but a league of robbers? Of course it could do nothing of the
      kind. Even when the bourgeoisie hoists the bloodstained standard of a
      militarist dictatorship, it continues to talk of 'the cause of the whole
      people'. But the capitalist class is peculiarly adroit in the way in which
      it cheats the people in the so-called democratic republics. In these, the
      bourgeoisie rules, and is able to maintain its dictatorship through
      keeping up certain appearances. The workers are given the right of
      exercising the parliamentary vote every three or four years, but they are
      carefully excluded from all power in the administration. Yet because
      universal suffrage exists, the capitalist class loudly declares that the
      'whole people' rules.</P>
    
    <P>The Soviet Power openly proclaims its class character. It makes no
      attempt to conceal that it is a class power, that the Soviet State is the
      dictatorship of the poor. The point is emphasized in its very name; the
      Soviet Government is called the Workers' and Peasants' Government. The
      constitution, that is to say the fundamental laws of our Soviet Republic,
      the constitution adopted by the third All-Russian Soviet Congress,
      expressly declares: 'The third All- Russian Soviet Congress of workers',
      soldiers', and peasants' delegates, declares that now in the hour of the
      decisive struggle between the proletariat and the exploiters, there can be
      no place for the exploiters in any of the instruments of power.' The
      Soviet Power, therefore, not only proclaims its class character, but does
      not hesitate to deprive of electoral rights and to exclude from the
      instruments of power the representatives of those classes which are
      hostile to the proletariat and to the peasantry. For what reason can and
      must the Soviet Power act thus openly? Because the Soviet Power really is
      the power of the working masses, the power of the majority of the
      population. It has no occasion to conceal that it was born in working
      class quarters. Far from it, for the more conspicuously the Soviet Power
      insists upon its origin and its meaning, the closer will be the ties
      between itself and the masses, and the more outstanding will be its 
      success in the struggle against the exploiters.</P>
    
    <P>Of course this state of affairs will not last for ever. The essence of
      the matter lies herein, that it is necessary to crush the resistance of
      the exploiters. But as soon as the exploiters have been repressed,
      bridled, and tamed, as soon as they have been trained to work and have
      become workers like everyone else, the pressure upon them will be relaxed
      and the dictatorship of the proletariat will gradually disappear.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This is expressly stipulated in our constitution (Part
      II, Chapter 5) : 'The fundamental task of the constitution of the Russian
      Socialist Federative Soviet Republic - a constitution adapted to the needs
      of the present period of transition consists in the establishment of the
      dictatorship of the urban and rural workers and of the poor peasants in
      the form of a strong All-Russian Soviet Power, whose purpose it will be to
      effect the complete crushing of the bourgeoisie, to put an end to the
      exploitation of one human being by another, and to realize socialism, in
      which there will be neither division into classes nor any State
      authority.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P>From this we may deduce the tasks of our party. The party must
      systematically expose the bourgeois fraud, which is worked as follows.
      Certain rights are conceded to the worker, but he is left in material
      dependence upon a master. Consequently the task of our party is to crush
      the exploiters by all the means at the disposal of the proletariat.
      Furthermore, it will be incumbent upon our party, in proportion as it is
      able to crush the exploiters and their hangers- on, in proportion as it is
      able to refashion them, by degrees to mitigate and to revoke the measures
      which it was at first necessary to enforce. Let us suppose, for example,
      that the professional classes have drawn nearer to the working class, that
      they are no longer hostile to the workers, that in all they do they are
      wholly on the side of the Soviet Power, that they are on the best of terms
      with the proletariat. When this happens (and it is only a question of
      time), it will be incumbent upon us to give the professional classes full
      civil rights, and to accept them into our family. Today, when the whole
      world is in arms against the Workers' Republic, it would be premature to
      speak of such an extension of rights. But we must never cease to make it
      perfectly clear that the extension of rights will ultimately be given, and
      will be given all the sooner, in proportion as there comes a speedier end
      to the attempts made by the exploiters to overthrow communism. In this
      manner the proletarian State will gradually die out, and will undergo
      transformation into a Stateless communist society, wherein the division
      into classes will have completely disappeared.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="049"></A>§ 49 Rights of the workers under bourgeois
    democracy and under the Soviet Power</H4>
    
    <P>One of the chief frauds of bourgeois democracy consists in this, that it
      gives only the appearance of rights. On paper we read that the workers can
      elect to parliament in perfect freedom; that they have the same rights as
      the masters (they are said to be 'equal before the law'); that they have
      the right of combination and of public meeting; that they can publish any
      newspaper and books they please; and so on. These things are called the
      'essence of democracy'; we are assured that democracy is for everyone, for
      the whole people, for all the citizens, so that conditions are quite
      different from those in the Soviet Republic.</P>
    
    <P>First of all we must point out that no such bourgeois democracy really
      exists. It existed a hundred years ago, but Mr Bourgeois has done away
      with it long since.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The United States will serve as the best example of
      this. Here, during the war, the following laws were promulgated: It was
      for bidden to speak slightingly of the president; it was forbidden to say
      anything to the discredit of the Allies; it was forbidden to declare that
      the entry of the US and of the Entente into the war was the outcome of
      sordid, material motives; it was forbidden to advocate a premature peace;
      it was forbidden to utter any public condemnation of the policy of the US
      government; it was forbidden to say anything to the credit of Germany; it
      was forbidden to advocate the overthrow of the existing order, the
      abolition of private property, the class war, etc. The penalty for
      breaking any of these laws ranged from 3 to 20 years' imprisonment. In the
      course of a single year, about 1,500 workers were arrested for such
      offences. The working class organization known as the IWW (Industrial
      Workers of the World) was savagely attacked, and some of its leaders were
      lynched. As an example of the 'right to strike', we may mention the strike
      at the Arizona copper mines in the year 1917, when many of the workers
      were shot, others flogged, and others tarred and feathered; when whole
      families were hunted from their homes and reduced to beggary. Again,
      during the strike at Rockefeller's coal mines, at Ludlow in the State of
      Colorado, Rockefeller's gunmen shot and burned several hundred workmen and
       workwomen. Although Congress is elected by universal suffrage, it merely
      carries out the orders of the trust kings, for nearly all the congressmen
      are in the pay of the trusts. The uncrowned kings are the real dictators
      of America. Among them we may name: Rockefeller, the head of the Standard
      Oil Trust, which controls, in addition to the oil wells, a vast number of
      banks; Morgan, the railway king, also in control of numerous banks;
      Schwab, the steel king; Swift, the head of the meat trust; Dupont, the
      powder king, who amassed incredible wealth during the war. Suffice it to
      say that Rockefeller's income is $10,000 per <I>hour</I>! Who can
      withstand such strength? This gang of Schwabs and Rockefellers holds
      everything in its hands in the name of 'democracy'.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Even if what is termed bourgeois democracy did really exist, in
      comparison with the Soviet Power it would not be worth a cracked farthing.
      Paper laws are of no use to the working class unless the possibility of
      their realization exists. But such a possibility of realization does not
      exist under the capitalist régime, cannot exist under the system in
      which the capitalists own all the wealth. Even if the workers enjoy on
      paper the right of meeting, they often find it quite impossible to
      exercise such a right. For instance, the innkeepers, incited by the big
      sharks of capital, or moved by their own hostility to the workers, will
      frequently refuse to let rooms for meetings - and the workers have nowhere
      else to go. Here is another example. The workers wish to publish a
      newspaper, and they have the legal right to do so. But to exercise this
      right they need money, paper, offices, a printing press, etc. All these
      things are in the hands of the capitalists. The capitalists won't relax
      their grip. Nothing doing! Out of the workers' paltry wage it is
      impossible to accumulate adequate funds. The result is that the
      bourgeoisie has masses of newspapers and can cheat the workers to its
      heart's content day after day; whereas the workers, notwithstanding their
      legal 'rights', have practically no press of their own.</P>
    
    <P>Such is the real character of the workers' 'freedom' under bourgeois
      democracy. The freedom exists solely on paper. The workers have what is
      termed 'formal' freedom. In substance, however, they have no freedom,
      because their formal freedom cannot be translated into the realm of fact.
      It is the same here as in all other departments of life. According to
      bourgeois theory, master and man are equals in capitalist society, since
      'free contract' exists: the employer offers work; the worker is free to
      accept or refuse. Thus it is upon paper! In actual fact, the master is
      rich and well fed; the worker is poor and hungry. He must work or starve.
      Is this equality? There can be no equality between rich and poor, whatever
      the written word declares. This is why, in the capitalist régime,
      'freedom' has a bourgeois complexion.</P>
    
    <P>In the Soviet Republic, on the other hand, freedom really exists for the
      working class. It exists because it is a freedom which can be translated
      into the realm of fact. Let us quote from the constitution of the Russian
      Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (Part II, Chapter 5).</P>
    
    <P>'14. In order to secure for the workers actual freedom of expression of
      opinion, the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic abolishes the
      dependence of the press upon capital, and puts into the hands of the
      working class and the poor peasantry all the technical and material means
      for the publication of newspapers, pamphlets, books, and all other
      products of the printing press, and provides for their free distribution
      throughout the country.</P>
    
    <P>'15. In order to secure for the workers the actual right of assembly,
      the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic gives to all citizens of
      the Soviet Republic the unrestricted right to hold meetings and
      congresses, to march in processions, etc., and puts into the hands of the
      working class and the poor peasants all the buildings suitable for the
      purpose of holding public meetings, together with the provision of light,
      heating, etc.</P>
    
    <P>'16. In order to secure for the workers actual freedom of combination,
      the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, having overthrown the
      economic and political power of the possessing classes, and having removed
      all the hindrances which hitherto in bourgeois society have prevented the
      workers and peasants from effectively realizing the freedom of
      organization and activity, furnishes to the workers and poor peasants
      every kind of assistance, material and moral, requisite for their
      combination and organization.</P>
    
    <P>'17. In order to secure for the workers effective access to knowledge,
      the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic makes it its duty to
      provide the workers and poor peasants with a complete, many-sided, and
      gratuitous education.'</P>
    
    <P>Herein we see the enormous difference between the spurious freedoms of
      bourgeois democracy and the effective freedoms of proletarian democracy.</P>
    
    <P>The Soviet Power and our party have already done much in this direction.
      The mansions of the nobles, the theatres, the printing presses, paper,
      etc. - all these now belong to the working class organizations and to the
      workers' State. Our further task is to help by all possible means towards
      the full realization of these rights by the backward strata of the
      proletariat and the peasantry. This will be achieved in two ways. First of
      all, we must continually advance along the road we have marked out, and
      must do everything in our power to broaden the material foundations of the
      workers' freedom. We must, therefore, do our utmost to design and build
      new houses, set up new printing presses, instal workers' palaces, etc.
      Secondly, the backward strata of the population must be made intimately
      acquainted with those possibilities of freedom which already exist, but
      which they have not hitherto been able to profit by, owing to ignorance,
      mental darkness, and lack of culture.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="050"></A>§ 50 The equality of the workers, irrespective
    of sex, creed and race</H4>
    
    <P>Bourgeois democracy proclaims in words a whole series of freedoms, but
      from the oppressed these freedoms are safeguarded by five locks and seven
      seals. Among other things, bourgeois democracy has often declared that
      people are equal irrespective of sex, creed, race, and nationality.
      Proudly has the pledge been given that under the bourgeois democratic
      system all are equals: women and men; whites, yellows, and blacks;
      Europeans and Asiatics; Buddhists, Christians, and Jews. In reality, the
      bourgeoisie has failed to carry out these pledges. During the imperialist
      epoch, there has been all over the world a terrible increase in racial and
      national oppression. (For details see the next chapter.) But even as
      concerns women, bourgeois democracy is far from having realized equality.
      Woman has remained a being without rights, a domestic animal, part of the
      furniture of the marital couch.</P>
    
    <P>The working woman in capitalist society is peculiarly oppressed,
      peculiarly deprived of rights. In all matters she has even less than the
      beggarly rights which the bourgeoisie grants to the working man. The right
      to the parliamentary vote has been conceded in a few countries only. As
      regards the right of inheritance, woman everywhere receives the beggar's
      portion. In family life she is always subject to her husband, and
      everything that goes wrong is considered to be her fault. In a word,
      bourgeois democracy everywhere exhibits as regards women laws and customs
      which strongly remind us of the customs of savages, who exchange, buy,
      punish, or steal women just as if they were chattels, dolls, or beasts of
      burden. Our Russian proverb runs, 'A hen is not a bird, and a woman is not
      a person'; here we have the valuation of a slave society. This state of
      affairs is extremely disadvantageous to the proletariat. There are more
      women than men amongst the workers. It is obvious that the struggle of the
      proletariat must be greatly hindered by the lack of equality between the
      two halves of which it is composed. Without the aid of the women of the
      proletariat, it is idle to dream of a general victory, it is idle to dream
      of the 'freeing of labour'. For this reason, it is greatly to the interest
      of the working class that there should be complete fighting comradeship
      between the female and the male portions of the proletariat, and that this
      comradeship should be strengthened by equality. The Soviet Power is the
      first to have realized such equality in all departments of life: in
      marriage, in the family, in political affairs, etc. In all things,
      throughout Soviet Russia, women are the equals of men.</P>
    
    <P>It is incumbent upon our party to effect the realization of this
      equality in actual life. Before all, we must make it clear to the broad
      masses of the workers that the subjection of women is extremely harmful to
      them. Hitherto among the workers it has been customary to look upon women
      as inferiors; as for the peasants, they smile when a 'mere woman' begins
      to take an interest in social affairs. In the Soviet Republic the working
      woman has exactly the same rights as the working man; she can elect to the
      soviets and be elected to them.; she can hold any commissar's office; can
      do any kind of work in the army, in economic life, and in the State
      administration.</P>
    
    <P>But in Russia, working women are far more backward than working men.
      Many people look down upon them. In this matter persevering efforts are
      needed: among men, that they may cease blocking women's road; among women,
      that they may learn to make a full use of their rights, may cease to be
      timid or diffident.</P>
    
    <P>We must not forget that 'every cook has to be taught to take her share
      in governmental administration'. We have learned above that the really
      important matter is not the right that is written on paper, but the
      possibility of realizing a right in practice. How can a working woman
      effectively realize her rights when she has to devote so much time to
      housekeeping, must go to the market and wait her turn there, must do the
      family washing, must look after her children, must bear the heavy burden
      of all this domestic drudgery?</P>
    
    <P>The aim of the Soviet Republic and of our party must be, to deliver
      working women from such slavery, to free the working woman from these
      obsolete and antediluvian conditions. The organization of house communes
      (not places in which people will wrangle, but places in which they will
      live like human beings) with central wash-houses; the organization of
      communal kitchens; the organization of communal nurseries, kindergartens,
      playgrounds, summer colonies for children, schools with communal dining
      rooms, etc. - such are the things which will enfranchise woman, and will
      make it possible for her to interest herself in all those matters which
      now interest the proletarian man.</P>
    
    <P>In an era of devastation and famine, it is, of course, difficult to do
      all these things as they ought to be done. Nevertheless, our party must in
      this manner do its utmost to attract the working woman to play her part in
      the common task.</P>
    
    <P><FONT>National equality, racial equality, etc., will be considered in
      the next chapter. Here we shall merely quote the paragraphs in the
      constitution which touch on this topic (Part II, Chapter 5).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">'20. In view of the solidarity of the workers of all
      lands, the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic grants the
      political rights of Russian citizens to foreigners living in the
      territories of the Russian Republic, provided they live by their own
      labour and either belong to the working class or are peasants who do not
      employ others' labour ; it recognizes the right of the local soviets to
      grant Russian citizenship to such foreigners without any tedious
      formalities.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">'21. The Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic

      recognizing the equal rights of all citizens irrespective of their racial
      or national origin, declares the institution or maintenance of any
      privilege or preferential advantage upon the ground of such origin to be
      contrary to the fundamental law of the republic; no less contrary to the
      fundamental law is any sort of oppression of national minorities or any
      limitation of their equal rights.'</FONT></P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="051"></A>§ 51 Parliamentarism and the Soviet system</H4>
    
    <P>In bourgeois democratic States, at the head of everything stands what is
      known as parliament. This is a representative institution, the electoral
      franchise varying in different countries. In some, only the rich have the
      vote; in some, a part of the poor are admitted to the franchise; in a
      third group, all the men of a certain age can vote; in a fourth country,
      all the women as well.</P>
    
    <P>But even where parliament is elected by universal suffrage, the majority
      of the seats are invariably occupied by representatives of the
      bourgeoisie. Why does this always happen? The reason is obvious in view of
      what we have already learned. Let us suppose that the workers, who form
      the majority in the country, have the right to vote. But let us further
      suppose that all the wealth is in the hands of the capitalists, that they
      own all the newspapers and all the places where public meetings can be
      held, and that artists, printing presses, and millions of leaflets are at
      their service; that from all the pulpits the clergy advocate their cause;
      let us suppose, moreover, that the poor workers are engaged day after day
      in exhausting toil, that they have no meeting-places, that clever fellows
      circulate among them (agents of the bourgeoisie, lawyers, journalists, and
      other glib talkers) advocating what seem to be excellent watchwords, and
      thus confusing the workers' minds; let us remember the enormous financial
      resources of the trust magnates, which enable them to corrupt the workers'
      representatives - however honest these may have been at the outset - by
      offering comfortable jobs, by flattery in the daily press, and so on. Then
      we can understand why it is that even in such parliaments the majority
      always consists of the secret or declared agents of the bourgeoisie, of
      financial capital, of the bank kings.</P>
    
    <P>It is, therefore, extraordinarily difficult for the working masses to
      elect any of their own folk as representatives.</P>
    
    <P>Once a representative finds his way to parliament, the matter is
      finished; he can defy the electors; for three or four years his seat is
      secure. He is independent of them. He sells himself right and left. He
      cannot be recalled by the electors; the law makes no provision for
      anything of the kind.</P>
    
    <P>Such is the state of affairs in a bourgeois democratic republic under
      parliamentarism. It is very different in the Soviet Republic. Here the
      parasites -the traders and the factory owners, the prelates and the
      landlords, the military officers and the rich peasants - have no right to
      the vote. They can neither elect nor be elected. On the other hand, the
      exercise of the franchise by the workers and the poor peasants is simple
      and easy. Moreover, every delegate to the soviet can be recalled by the
      electors, who can send another in his place. If the delegate fulfils his
      duties badly, if he turns his coat, etc., he can be recalled. This right
      of recall has nowhere been so extensively adopted as in the Soviet
      Republic.</P>
    
    <P>In a bourgeois republic, parliament is a 'talking shop'; the members do
      nothing but discuss and make speeches. The real work is done by officials,
      ministers of State, etc. Parliament passes laws; it 'controls' the
      ministers by asking them various questions; it votes what the
      administration decides. In parliament is concentrated what is termed the
      legislative authority. But the executive authority is in the hands of the
      cabinet. Parliament, therefore, does nothing; parliament merely talks. In
      the soviet system, affairs are arranged quite differently. The highest and
      most important instrument of government is the Congress of Soviets. The
      constitution states: 'The All-Russian Congress of Soviets is the supreme
      authority of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.' It must
      meet at least twice a year. Having reviewed the general situation, it
      makes suitable decisions, which become laws. The members of the congress
      are not professional talkers, but real workers, with something definite to
      do. In the intervals between the congresses the supreme authority is
      vested in the Central Executive Committee, elected by the congress. The
      Central Executive Committee exercises at one and the same time legislative
      and executive functions; that is to say, it not only passes laws, but
      conducts public affairs. Its departments are known as the People's
      Commissariats, and its members work in these commissariats. Thus the
      Central Executive Committee is a real <I>working </I>committee.</P>
    
    <P>Like the Central Executive Committee, the other soviet institutions are
      closely unified, and are based upon a whole series of organizations of the
      working masses. The soviet institutions are based on the Communist Party,
      the trade unions, the factory committees, and the cooperatives. These
      organizations comprise many millions of workers, who all combine to
      support the Soviet Power. Through the instrumentality of these
      organizations, the toiling masses take an active part in the State
      administration. The Communist Party and the trade unions appoint their
      most trusted members to fill all the posts and to carry out all the
      functions. In this way the best among the workers are delegated, not
      merely to talk, but actually to administer. In the so-called democratic
      republic, nothing of this kind happens. There the working class elector
      drops his ballot paper into the box, and then his part in the affair ends.
      The burgeoisie assures him that he has fulfilled his 'duties as a
      citizen'; he need trouble himself no longer about affairs of State.</P>
    
    <P>These arrangements conceal one of the fundamental frauds of the
      bourgeois system of government. The fraud is of the same nature as those
      previously explained. On paper it seems as if the workers were '
      participating' in some way. In actual fact they are altogether outside the
      current of affairs. Everything is administered and all the work is done by
      a special caste of bourgeois officials, quite distinct from the masses,
      and constituting what is known as the bureaucracy. The administrative
      apparatus is out of reach of the masses; the masses have no contact with
      it whatever.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Down to the sixteenth or seventeenth century the State
      officials were drawn only from the nobility. During the change to the
      capitalist system, a professional officialdom came into existence. Of late
      years, this professional officialdom has been -mainly recruited from the
      ranks of the so-called intelligentsia or professional classes, but the
      higher posts have been filled by members of the wealthier bourgeoisie.
      Even the lesser officials, however, are trained in a spirit of devotion
      towards the robber State; the more talented among, them look forward to a
      rise in rank, to orders and titles, to an 'official career'. The result is
      that most of these gentlemen are full of profound disdain for the 'common
      people'. The dimensions and growth of this officialdom may be learned from
      the following figures, which are taken from Olshevsky's book <I>Bureaucracy</I>.
      In <I>Austria</I>, in the year 1874, they numbered in round figures
      27,000; in 1891, they numbered 16,000; in 1900 they numbered 169,000. In
      <I>France</I>, the number of officials in the year 1891 was 1,500,000,
      this being approximately 4 per cent of the population. In <I>Britain</I>,
      in the same year, there were about 1,000,000 officials [civil servants],
      this being approximately 2-6 per cent of the population. In the <I>United
      States</I>, in the year 1890, there were 750,000 officials. Olshevsky,
      himself a bourgeois, tells us that the bureaucracy is characterized by the
      following traits: routinism, red- tapism, overbearing manners, pettiness.
      In all capitalist countries, administrative work is actually in the hands
      of an officialdom of this character. We must repeat that the highest
      officials are mainly recruited from the wealthier bourgeoisie, and from
      the circles of the nobility and the great landowners. This is inevitable
      in capitalist society, where the bourgeoisie rules.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>In the Soviet Republic, the masses do not merely elect (electing not
      venal lawyers but their own folk), but they participate in the work of
      administration, for the soviets and the other organizations of the working
      masses are actually engaged in administrative work.</P>
    
    <P>As far as the soviets are concerned, the elections are of such a
      character as will retain close contact between these bodies and the
      masses. For the elections to the soviets are not territorial in the
      residential sense, but are based upon the places where people work
      (factories, workshops, etc.); they are based, as the phrase runs, upon
      'productive units'. Those who are united in their working life elect from
      among their number, as their delegates, the persons in whom they have the
      greatest confidence.</P>
    
    <P>Thus the Soviet Power realizes an enormously higher form, a far more
      genuinely popular form, of democracy - proletarian democracy.</P>
    
    <P>What, then, is the further task of our party? Our common course is
      clear. Our party has to realize proletarian democracy to a greater and
      ever greater extent; to bring about an increasingly close contact between
      delegates or elected persons (those deputed to perform various tasks) and
      the masses; to induce the workers to participate more and more effectively
      in the work of administration; finally, to ensure that millions of eyes
      shall watch the delegates and control their work. Everything possible must
      be done to see to it that all persons entrusted with authority shall be
      held responsible and shall frequently be called to account.</P>
    
    <P>The carrying out of these tasks is a great undertaking. There are many
      obstacles to be overcome. The obstacles must be surmounted. We must
      achieve a full and inseparable union of three elements: the State
      apparatus; the active masses of the proletariat, the builders of
      communism; and the poor peasants.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="052"></A>§ 52 The army and the Soviet Power</H4>
    
    <P>Proletarian democracy, like every other State authority, has its armed
      forces - its army and its navy. In the bourgeois democratic State, the
      army is used to keep down the workers and to defend the capitalists'
      money-bags. The proletarian army, the Red Army of the Soviet Republic, is
      used for the class purposes of the proletariat and for the struggle
      against the bourgeoisie. Consequently, in respect of the conditions of
      service and in respect of political rights, there is a vast difference
      between a bourgeois army and a proletarian army. The bourgeoisie finds it
      expedient to pretend that its army is 'above politics'. In reality, it
      uses the army as a means for promoting its predatory and
      counter-revolutionary policy under the flag of the defence of 'national
      interests'. It does everything in its power to sow division between the
      army and the people. By a thousand subterfuges, it deprives soldiers of
      the possibility of utilizing their political rights. Things are very
      different in the Soviet Republic. In the first place, the proletariat
      frankly declares that the Red Army is an instrument for use in the
      political class struggle against the bourgeoisie. In the second place; the
      Soviet Power uses all possible means to bring about an intimate union
      between the army and the people. The workers are solidarized in the
      soviets with the soldiers of the Red Army; these soviets are known as
      'Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Delegates'. The workers and the
      soldiers study in the same schools, and attend the same courses of
      lectures, they mingle at public meetings; they rub shoulders in
      demonstrations. Again and again, the workers have entrusted the fighting
      flag to the soldiers of the Red Army; and again and again the soldiers
      have entrusted the colours to the workers. In the Soviet State, which is
      nothing else than a great republic of workers, success can only be
      achieved in the fight against our enemies when there is an indestructible
      unity between the Red Army and the revolutionary working class.</P>
    
    <P>The more intimate the solidarity of the working class with the army and
      of the army with the working class, the more durable will be our fighting
      revolutionary strength. Obviously, then, our party must sustain, develop,
      and strengthen this unity. Experience has shown that intimate association
      with proletarian organizations exercises a remarkable influence upon the
      army. We need only recall the resistance to Kolchak in the summer of 1919
      and to Denikin in the autumn of the same year. These victories could not
      have been achieved had not the army been assisted by workers from the
      party, from the trade unions, etc., who flocked to the colours. For this
      reason the Red Army of the proletariat is in actual fact, and not merely
      in words, the first people's army, the first army created by the will of
      the workers, organized by the workers, solidarized with them, indissolubly
      united with them, and, by means of its representatives in the soviets, 
      participating in the administration of the country. The Red Army is not
      something distinct from the people; it consists of the working class and
      the poor peasants; and it marches under the leadership of the working
      class. The army lives in the most intimate association with the workers at
      the rear. It is the absolute duty of our party to be indefatigable in its
      endeavours to consolidate this unity.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="053"></A>§ 53 The leading role of the proletariat</H4>
    
    <P>In our revolution, which is a communist revolution, the princi pal role,
      the role of leader, has been assigned to the proletariat. The proletariat
      is the most united and the best organized class. The proletariat is the
      only class whose conditions of life in capitalist society have been such
      as to lead to the acquirement of sound communist views; to it alone have
      these conditions disclosed the true goal and the right way of attaining
      it. Naturally, therefore, the proletariat has led the van in this
      revolution. The peasants (the middle peasants and even some of the poor
      peasants) were far from steadfast. They were only successful when they
      joined forces with the proletariat. Conversely, whenever the peasants took
      a different line from the proletarians, they were inevitably enslaved by
      Denikin, Kolchak, or some other representative of the landlords, the
      capitalists, or the military caste.</P>
    
    <P>This leading role, this dominant mission of the proletariat, finds
      expression in the soviet constitution. Our laws grant the proletariat
      certain preferential political rights. For example, the electoral
      arrangements of the Congresses of Soviets are of such a nature, that,
      proportionally to their numbers, the urban workers have more delegates
      than the peasants.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Here are the relevant paragraphs of the constitution.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">'The All-Russian Congress of Soviets consists of
      representatives of the Town Soviets, which are entitled to send one
      delegate for every 25,000 electors, and of representatives of the
      Provincial Soviets, which are entitled to send one delegate for every
      125,000 inhabitants.' (Part III, Chapter 5, Par. 25.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">' Congresses of Soviets consist of: (a) Regional
      Congresses, composed of representatives from the Town Soviets and from the
      County Congresses of Soviets, in the proportion of one delegate to 25,000
      inhabitants, and from the Towns in the proportion of one delegate to 5,000
      electors, with the proviso that there shall not be more than 500 delegates
      for the whole Region - or composed of the representatives to the
      Provincial Congresses of Soviets, elected on the same basis when the
      Provincial Congress meets immediately before the Regional Congress of
      Soviets. (b) Provincial Congresses composed of representatives of the Town
      Soviets and of the Rural District Congresses of Soviets, in the proportion
      of one delegate to 10,000 inhabitants, and from the Towns in the
      proportion of one delegate to 2,000 electors, with the proviso that there
      shall not be more than 300 delegates for the whole Province - but when a
      County Congress of Soviets takes place immediately before the Provincial
      Congress of Soviets, the elections shall be held after the manner of
      those, not to the Rural District Congress of Soviets, but to the County
      Congress of Soviets.' (Part III, Chapter 10, Par. 53.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the towns, it will be seen, the delegates are
      elected proportionally to the number of electors, but in the villages,
      proportionally to the number of inhabitants (these comprising, not only
      the workers in the strict sense of the term, but also the rich peasants,
      the clergy, the rural bourgeoisie, etc., as well as the children, who have
      no electoral rights). It follows from this that the preference given to
      the urban workers as against the peasants is less extensive than might
      appear at first sight. But the preferential treatment is indubitable.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>These constitutionally specified privileges merely give expression to
      what actually exists, namely that the solidly organized urban proletariat
      leads the disorganized rural masses.</P>
    
    <P>It is the first duty of the Communist Party to do everything it can to
      make plain that these privileges are temporary. In proportion as the
      backward strata of the country dwellers grow more enlightened, when
      experience has convinced them that the measures adopted by the workers are
      right and profitable, when they realize that they must not walk with the
      bourgeoisie but only with the proletariat, obviously the abovedescribed
      temporary inequality will cease to exist.</P>
    
    <P>The Communist Party must utilize the privileges of the proletariat in
      order to influence the rural districts, in order to solidarize the more
      advanced workers with the peasants. Thus only will the revolutionary
      enlightenment of the poorer peasants be successfully achieved. The
      privileged position of the workers has not been given them that they may
      be exclusive or may separate themselves from the dwellers in the rural
      districts, but in order that they may make a good use of it, in order
      that, by their greater influence in the soviets and the administration,
      they may bring the working class into closer contact with village life,
      that they may inaugurate and sustain a comradely union of the proletariat
      with the middle peasants and the poor peasants. Thus the workers will be
      able to free the peasants from the influence of the rich peasants, the
      clergy, the sometime landlords, etc.</P>
    
    <H4><A NAME="054"></A>§ 54 Bureaucracy and the Soviet Power</H4>
    
    <P>The Soviet Power has been organized, as the power of a new class, the
      proletariat, upon the ruins of the old bourgeois power. Before the
      proletariat could organize its own power, it had to break the power of its
      adversaries. With the aid of the Soviet Power, the proletariat seized and
      destroyed the vestiges of the old State. It broke up the old police force,
      abolished the remnants of the secret service, abolished the gendarmerie
      and the tsarist bourgeois law courts with their public prosecutors and
      salaried defenders; it swept away many of the old government departments,
      annihilated the bourgeois ministries of State with their armies of
      officials, etc. What was the aim of all this? And what is now the general
      task of our party? We have referred to the matter already in Part One of
      the present work. The task is this, to replace the old officialdom by the
      masses themselves, to bring it to pass that the whole working population
      shall put its hand to the job of administration (working in some
      occupations by turns for brief spells, and in other occupations by turns
      for long spells). But we have had serious difficulties to encounter. The
      chief obstacles have been the following.</P>
    
    <P>First of all came the imperfect development, the lack of enlightenment,
      the timidity, of the backward strata of the urban population and still
      more of the rural population. The vanguard, which consists of the bold
      spirits, of those who are active in body and in mind, of those who are
      well informed, constitutes a comparatively thin stratum. The others are
      very slow to move. A great many are still afraid to put their hands to the
      plough; a great many are still ignorant of their own rights, and have not
      yet realized that they are the masters of the country. This is not
      difficult to understand. The masses have been oppressed and enslaved for
      centuries; it is impossible that from their half-savage condition they
      should in a moment rise to a level at which they can govern the country.
      Those who first come to the front are those who belong to the most highly
      developed stratum; the workers of Petrograd, for instance. These we
      encounter everywhere. We find them as army commissars, as organizers of
      production, as executive committee delegates in the rural districts, as
      propagandists, as members of the highest soviet institutions, as teachers.
      By degrees even the backward masses are leavened; they cast the old things
      aside; they assimilate the new; little by little they teach themselves. It
      is, however, obvious that the low level of general culture must be a great
      hindrance to progress.</P>
    
    <P>Secondly we had the lack of experience in the work of administration.
      This is manifest even in the best of the comrades. The working class has
      for the first time taken power into its hands. It has never done any
      administrative work, and no one has ever taught it how to do anything of
      the kind. On the contrary, for decades during the tsarist régime,
      and also during the brief Guchkov-Kerensky administration, everything that
      was possible was done to prevent the proletariat from getting any such
      experience. Both the bourgeois and the feudalist State were organizations
      for keeping the workers down, not organizations for educating them.
      Naturally, therefore, the workers, having risen to power, will, while
      learning by experience, make a great many mistakes. By these mistakes they
      learn, but inevitably they make them.</P>
    
    <P>Thirdly we had trouble with bourgeois specialists of the old school. The
      proletariat was forced to retain many of them in its service. It made them
      submit, set them to work, got the better of their sabotage. In the end, it
      has turned them to successful account. But these bourgeois experts are apt
      to cling to their old customs. They look down upon the masses with
      contempt, and will not mix with them on equal terms; they often cling to
      the old and evil office routine; they dilly-dally; and their bad example
      tends to corrupt our own people.</P>
    
    <P>Fourthly we had the withdrawal of the best energies to the army. During
      the most critical periods of the civil war, when the army was in urgent
      need of the most trusty and valiant fighters, it was often necessary to
      dispatch the very best of our own people to the front. In consequence of
      this, there remained at the rear only a comparatively small number of the
      most advanced among the workers.</P>
    
    <P>All these circumstances make our work extremely difficult, and tend to a
      certain degree to promote the reintroduction of bureaucracy into the
      Soviet system. This is a grave danger for the proletariat. The workers did
      not destroy the old officialridden State with the intention of allowing it
      to grow up again from new roots. Our party, therefore, must do its utmost
      to avert this danger. It can only be averted by attracting the masses to
      take part in the work. The fundamental matter, of course, is to raise the
      general cultural level of the workers and peasants, to make an end of
      illiteracy, to diffuse enlightenment. In addition, however, a whole series
      of other measures is essential. Among these, our party advocates the
      following.</P>
    
    <P>It is absolutely indispensable that every member of a soviet should play
      some definite part in the work of State administration. It is incumbent
      upon every member of a soviet, not merely to pass opinions upon the
      matters that come up for discussion, but himself to take part in the
      common task, in his own person to fill some social office.</P>
    
    <P>The next essential is that there should be a continuous rotation in
      these functions. This implies that every comrade must, after a definite
      time, change over from one occupation to another, so that by degrees he
      shall become experienced in all the important branches of administrative
      work. The comrade must not stick for years to one and the same job, for if
      he does this he will become a routinist official of the old type. As soon
      as he has learned the routine of one office, he must remove to another.</P>
    
    <P>Finally, our party recommends, as far as concerns the general
      arrangement of the work, that by degrees the entire working population
      shall be induced to participate in the State administration. Here, in
      fact, is the true foundation of our political system. Certain steps in
      this direction have already been taken. For example, ten thousand
      proletarians participated in the house-to-house visitations of the
      Petrograd bourgeoisie. Again, nearly the whole of the working population
      of Petrograd took part in safeguarding the city. Yet again, to relieve the
      men for other duties, working women entered the militia service. In the
      soviets it is possible to train non-members as assistants. By looking on,
      at first, they can learn the work of the executive committee and the sub-
      committees. The same thing can be done in the factory committees and in
      the trade unions, where all the members can take office by turns. In a
      word, in one way or another (practical experience will teach us the best
      methods), we must follow in the footsteps of the Paris Commune, must
      simplify the work of administration, attract the masses to participate in
      it, completely put an end to bureaucracy. The more extensive this
      participation of the masses is, the sooner will the dictatorship of the
      proletariat die out. As soon as all the healthy adult members of the
      population, all without exception, have come to participate in
      administration, the last vestiges of bureaucracy will disappear.
      Concurrently with the disappearance of our bourgeois antagonists, we shall
      be able to celebrate the obsequies of the State. The government of men
      will be replaced by the administration of things - the administration of
      machinery, buildings, locomotives, and other apparatus. The communist
      order of society will be fully installed.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The dying out of the State will proceed far more
      rapidly when a complete victory has been gained over the imperialists.
      Today, when a fierce civil war is still raging, all our organizations have
      to be on a war footing. The instruments of the Soviet Power have had to be
      constructed on militarist lines Often enough there is no time to summon
      the soviets, and as a rule, therefore, the executive committees have to
      decide everything.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This state of affairs is due to the military situation
      of the Soviet Republic. What exists today in Russia is not simply the
      dictatorship of the proletariat; it is a militarist- proletarian
      dictatorship The republic is an armed camp. Obviously, the above-described
      conditions will not pass away while the need persists for the
      militarization of all our organizations.</FONT></P>
