    <H4>§ 26 Financial capital</H4>
    
    <P>We have previously seen that among the entrepreneurs there is a
      continuous and fierce struggle for buyers, and that the unfailing result
      of this struggle is the victory of the great entrepreneurs. Hence the
      lesser capitalists are ruined, so that capital and production as a whole
      accumulate in the hands of the great capitalists (the concentration and
      centralization of capital). By the beginning of the eighties in the
      nineteenth century, the centralization of capital was already far
      advanced. In place of the individual owners of enterprises there now
      appeared large numbers of joint-stock enterprises, cooperative concerns;
      but it must be carefully noted that these 'cooperatives' were companies of
      capitalist shareholders. What was the significance of this development?
      Why did joint-stock companies come into existence? It is easy to answer
      the question. The time had arrived when every new undertaking required the
      command of a considerable quantity of capital. If an enterprise scantily
      furnished with capital was founded, its chance of life was poor; on all
      sides it was surrounded by its more vigorous competitors, by enterprises
      which were manufacturing on a larger scale. If, therefore, a new
      enterprise was not to perish in its infancy, if the undertaking was to
      live and thrive, it had to be built up on strong foundations. But strong
      foundations could only be provided by those who had plenty of capital. The
      joint-stock company was the outcome of this need. The essence of the
      matter is that a few great capitalists make use of the capital of lesser
      capitalists, and make use also of the savings that have accumulated in the
      hands of non-capitalistic groups (employees, peasants, civil servants,
      etc.). Matters are arranged in the following way. Everyone contributes his
      portion; everyone takes a 'share' or a number of 'shares'. In return for
      his money he receives a 'share certificate' which gives him the right to
      receive a definite portion of the income. In this way the accumulation of
      small sums promptly gives rise to a large quantity of 'jointstock
      capital'.</P>
    
    <P>When joint-stock companies first came into existence, certain bourgeois
      theorists, and in addition certain socialist advocates of class
      collaboration, began to assure the world that a new era was beginning.
      Capitalism, they declared, was not destined to result in the dominion of a
      small group of capitalists. Far from this; out of his savings every worker
      would be able to buy shares, and in this way every worker would become a
      capitalist. Capital, they said, was to an increasing extent being
      'democratized'; in course of time, the difference between the capitalists
      and the workers would disappear without any revolution.</P>
    
    <P>Of course this was utter nonsense. Things worked out very differently.
      The great capitalists simply made use of the lesser capitalists for their
      own purposes. The centralization of capital went on more rapidly than
      ever, now that competition had taken the form of a struggle between huge
      shareholding concerns.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is easy to understand how the great capitalist
      shareholders have been able to make the small shareholders their hodmen.
      The small shareholder often lives in another town from that in which the
      enterprise is centred, and cannot travel a hundred miles or more to attend
      a shareholders' meeting. Even when some of the ordinary shareholders turn
      up at the meeting, they are unorganized, and merely jostle one another
      like blind puppies. But the big shareholders are organized. They have a
      common plan; they can do what they please. Experience has shown that it
      suffices the great capitalist to own one-third of all the shares, for this
      gives him absolute control of the whole undertaking.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>But the development of the concentration and centralization of capital
      was to advance still further. During the last few decades the place of
      individual enterprises and individual shareholding companies has largely
      been taken by great capitalist combines known as <I>syndicates</I>, <I>cartels</I>,
      and <I>trusts</I>. Why have these been formed? What is their
      significance?</P>
    
    <P>Let us suppose that in a certain branch of production, textiles or
      engineering, for instance, the lesser capitalists have already
      disappeared. There remain only five or six huge firms, shareholding
      companies, producing nearly all the commodities in these particular
      branches of enterprise. They are carrying on a cut-throat competition;
      they lower prices, and consequently make smaller profits. Let us now
      suppose that two of these concerns are larger and stronger than the 
      others. Then these two will continue the struggle until their rivals have
      been ruined. Let us further suppose that the strength of the two remaining
      competitors is practically identical; they work on a similar scale, they
      have the same sort of machinery, and they both employ about the same
      number of workers; there is no notable difference between them as regards
      the net cost of production. What will happen then? Neither can gain the
      victory; both are being exhausted by the struggle; neither of them is
      making any profit. The capitalist groups draw the same conclusion. Why,
      they ask themselves, should we go on cutting prices against one another?
      Would it not be better for us to unite, to join forces in order to fleece
      the public? If we combine, there will be no more competition; we shall
      control the market, and we can force up prices to any figure we please.</P>
    
    <P>Thus arises the combine, the league of capitalists, known as the
      syndicate or trust. The syndicate is distinguished from the trust in this
      way. When a <I>syndicate </I>is organized, the participating concerns
      agree that they will not sell their wares below a specified price; or they
      agree to share out the orders; or they agree to a territorial division of
      the market (you confine your sales to one district, and I will confine
      mine to another); and so on. In this arrangement, however, the management
      of the syndicate is not entitled to close down any of the undertakings;
      these are all members of a league in which each retains a certain measure
      of independence. In the <I>trust</I>, on the other hand, there is so
      intimate a union that each individual undertaking completely loses its
      independence; the management of the trust can close it down, reconstruct
      it, transfer it to another place, do whatever seems likely to be
      advantageous to the trust as a whole. The owner of the individual
      undertaking of course continues to receive his profits regularly, and
      these profits may even be larger than before; but the entire management is
      vested in the solidly constructed capitalist combine, the trust.</P>
    
    <P>Syndicates and trusts exercise an almost complete control over the
      market. They no longer fear competition, for they have crushed
      competition. Its place has been taken by capitalist <I>monopoly</I>, that
      is to say, by <I>the dominion of a single trust</I>.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P>In this way the concentration and centralization of capital gradually
      lead to the suppression of competition. Competition has devoured itself.
      The more frantic the development of capitalism, the quicker did
      centralization proceed, because the ruin of the weaker capitalists was
      more speedily effected. In the end the centralization of capital, arising
      out of competition, proved fatal to competition. 'FREE COMPETITION' HAS
      BEEN REPLACED BY THE DOMINION OF CAPITALIST COMBINES, BY THE RULE OF
      SYNDICATES AND TRUSTS.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">A few examples may be given, to show the enormous power
      wielded by trusts and syndicates. In the <I>United States </I>as long ago
      as 1900, that is to say in the very beginning of the twentieth century,
      the proportion of production in the hands of syndicates and trusts was as
      follows: Textiles, more than 50 per cent; glass, 54 per cent; paper, 60
      per cent; metals (excluding iron and steel), 84 per cent; iron and steel
      84 per cent; chemicals, 81 per cent; etc. It need hardly be said that
      during the last two decades the power of the combines has enormously
      increased. In actual fact, the whole industrial production of the US is
      today controlled by two trusts, the Standard Oil Trust and the Steel
      Trust; all the other trusts are dependents of these. In <I>Germany</I>,
      in the year 1913, 92.6 per cent of the coal mined in the
      Rhenish-Westphalian region was in the hands of a single syndicate; of all
      the steel produced within the German empire, nearly half was manufactured
      by the Steel Syndicate; the Sugar Trust supplied 70 per cent of the home
      demand and 80 per cent of the export demand.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Even in <I>Russia</I> quite a number of branches of
      industry had already passed completely under the sway of the syndicates.
      'Produgol' produced 60 per cent of the Donetz coal; 'Prodameta' [metal
      syndicate] controlled 88 to 93 per cent of the production; 'Krovlya'
      supplied 60 per cent of all the iron used for roofing; 'Prodwagon' was a
      syndicate of about 15 concerns building railway carriages; the Copper
      Syndicate controlled 90 per cent of the output of copper; the Sugar
      Syndicate controlled the entire production of sugar; and so on. According
      to the calculations of a Swiss expert, <I>at the beginning of the
      twentieth century half the capital of the world was already in the hands
      of trusts or syndicates</I>.</FONT>.</P>
    
    <P>Syndicates and trusts do not only centralize homogeneous enterprises.
      With increasing frequency there arise trusts that simultaneously embrace
      several branches of production. How does this take place?</P>
    
    <P>The various branches of production are connected one with another
      principally by means of buying and selling. Let us consider the production
      of iron ore and of coal. Here we have to do with products which serve as
      raw material for iron foundries and engineering workshops; in their turn
      these workshops turn out, let us suppose, machines; the machines serve as
      means of production in a series of other branches; and so on. Now let us
      imagine that we have an iron foundry. It buys iron ore and coal. Of course
      the interest of the smelting works is to buy the ore and the coal as
      cheaply as possible. But what if the ore and the coal are in the hands of
      another syndicate? There then begins a struggle between the two
      syndicates, which ends either in the victory of one of them or else in a
      fusion of the two. In either event there arises a new syndicate, uniting
      both branches of production. It is obvious that such a union can be
      effected in the case, not merely of two, but of three or of ten branches
      of production. Such enterprises are termed ' compound' (or 'combined')
      enterprises.</P>
    
    <P>In this manner syndicates and trusts do more than organize individual
      branches of production; they consolidate into a single organization
      various kinds of production, uniting one branch with a second, a third, a
      fourth, etc. Formerly, in all branches, the entrepreneurs were independent
      of one another, and the whole work of production was dispersed in a
      hundred thousand petty factories. By the beginning of the twentieth
      century, production was already concentrated in the hands of huge trusts,
      each organizing many branches of production.</P>
    
    <P>Unions of individual branches of production came about in another way
      besides that of the formation of 'combined' enterprises. The reader must
      now consider a phenomenon which is of even greater importance than
      'combined' enterprises. We refer to the dominion of the banks.</P>
    
    <P>First of all it is necessary to say a few words about banks.</P>
    
    <P>It has already been pointed out that when the concentration and
      centralization of capital had advanced to a considerable degree, there
      arose a need for capital which could be employed for the immediate
      establishment of large-scale enterprises. This need was one of the causes
      of the development of jointstock companies. The organization of new
      enterprises required larger and ever larger quantities of capital.</P>
    
    <P>Now let us consider what the capitalist does with the profit he
      receives. We know that he spends part of it upon his own immediate needs,
      in the way of food, clothing, and so on; the remainder, he ' saves'. The
      question arises, How does he do this? Is it possible for him at any moment
      to expand his business, to devote the 'saved' part of his profits to this
      purpose? No, he cannot do so, for this reason. Money flows in continually,
      but only in driblets. The commodities he produces are sold from time to
      time, and from time to time money is received for them. Evidently, that he
      may use these receipts for the expansion of his enterprise, the
      accumulation of a considerable sum is requisite. He will therefore have to
      wait until he has secured as much money as he needs - let us suppose that
      it is for the purchase of new machinery. And until then, what is he to do?
      Till then he cannot use the money. It lies idle. This does not happen to
      one or to two capitalists merely; at one time or another it happens to
      all. <I>Free capital</I> is constantly available. We have, however,
      pointed out before that there is a demand for capital. On the one hand
      there are superfluous sums lying idle; on the other hand there is a need
      for these sums. The more rapid the centralization of capital, the more
      vigorous is the demand for large sums of capital, but the greater likewise
      is the quantity of free capital. It is this state of affairs which gives
      the banks their importance. The capitalist, not wishing his money to lie
      idle, puts it in the bank, and the bank lends it to those who need it for
      the development of old enterprises or for the starting of new
      undertakings. Certain manufacturers deposit money in the bank, and the
      bank lends the money to other manufacturers. These latter, with the aid of
      the borrowed capital, extract surplus value. Part of their receipts is
      paid to the bank as interest. The bank then pays a portion of this last
      sum to its depositors, and keeps the rest as banking profits. Thus the
      machine grinds on. We can now understand why, during the latest phase of
      the capitalist régime, the role of the banks, their importance, and
      their activity, have expanded to a marvellous degree. The sums of capital
      sucked up by the banks are continually increasing. And to an increasing
      extent the banks invest capital in industry. Banking capital is ever ' at
      work' in industry; it undergoes conversion into industrial capital.
      Industry grows dependent on the banks, which support it and nourish it
      with capital. Banking capital coalesces with industrial capital. Here we
      have the form of capital which is known as <I>financial capital</I>. To
      summarize, FINANCIAL CAPITAL IS BANKING CAPITAL WHICH HAS BEEN GRAFTED ON
      INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL.</P>
    
    <P>Through the instrumentality of the banks, financial capital effects a
      yet more intimate union of all branches of industry than was effected by
      the direct combination of enterprises. Why is this?</P>
    
    <P>Let us suppose that we have before us a great bank. This great bank
      supplies with capital (or, as the phrase runs, 'finances') not merely one,
      but a large number of enterprises, or quite a number of syndicates. It is
      naturally to the bank's interest that,these financial dependents should
      not clash one with another. The bank unites them all. Its persistent
      policy is to bring about an actual union of the undertakings into a whole
      which shall be under its own administration. The bank begins to hold the
      reins in quite a series of branches of industry. Its confidential agents
      are appointed directors of trusts, syndicates, and individual
      undertakings.</P>
    
    <P>Thus in the end we arrive at the following picture. THE INDUSTRY OF THE
      WHOLE COUNTRY IS UNITED INTO SYNDICATES, TRUSTS, AND COMBINED ENTERPRISES.
      ALL THESE ARE UNITED BY BANKS. AT THE HEAD OF THE WHOLE ECONOMIC LIFE
      THERE IS A SMALL GROUP OF GREAT BANKERS WHO ADMINISTER INDUSTRY IN ITS
      ENTIRETY. THE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY SIMPLY FULFILS THE WILL OF THESE
      BANKERS AND TRUST MAGNATES.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This is very well shown in the <I>United States</I>.
      Here the 'democratic' administration of President Wilson is nothing more
      than a servant of the trusts. Congress merely carries out what has
      previously been decided at secret conclaves of trust magnates and bankers.
      The trusts spend vast sums in buying congressmen, in financing electoral
      campaigns, and the like. Myers, an American writer, reports that in the
      year 1904, the great life insurance companies spent the following sums in
      bribes: the Mutual, $364,254; the Equitable, $172,698; the New York,
      $204,019. The minister for finance, McAdoo, Wilson's sonin-law, is one of
      the leading bank and trust magnates. Senators, ministers of State,
      congressmen, are merely the henchmen of the great trusts, unless they
      themselves hold large interests in these bodies. The State authority, the
      governmental machinery of the 'free republic', is nothing more than a
      workshop for the fleecing of the public.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>We can therefore say that A CAPITALIST COUNTRY UNDER THE DOMINION OF
      FINANCIAL CAPITAL IS AS A WHOLE TRANSFORMED INTO AN IMMENSE COMBINED
      TRUST. AT THE HEAD OF THIS TRUST ARE THE BANKS. THE BOURGEOIS GOVERNMENT
      FORMS ITS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. The United States, Great Britain, France,
      Germany, etc., are nothing but State capitalist trusts, powerful
      organizations of trust magnates and bankers, exploiting and ruling
      hundreds of millions of wage slaves.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="027"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 27 Imperialism</H4>
    
    <P>In individual countries the effect of the sway of financial capital is,
      in a certain measure, to put an end to the anarchy of capitalist
      production. The various producers, who have hitherto been fighting one
      another, now join forces in a State capitalist trust.</P>
    
    <P>But what happens in this case to one of the fundamental contradictions
      of capitalism? We have said more than once that capitalism will inevitably
      break down because of its lack of organization and because it is affected
      by the class struggle. Now if one or these two contradictions (see
      <A HREF="01.htm#013">§13</A>) is invalid, may it not be that the
      prediction concerning the collapse of capitalism has no foundation?</P>
    
    <P>The point we chiefly have to consider is this. In actual fact the
      anarchy of production and competition has not ceased. Or perhaps it would
      be better to say that it ceases in one place to break out worse than ever
      in another. Let us endeavour to explain the matter in detail.</P>
    
    <P>Contemporary capitalism is world capitalism. All the countries are
      interconnected; they buy one from another. We cannot now find any country
      which is not under the heel of capitalism; we cannot find any country
      which produces for itself absolutely everything it needs.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">There are numerous articles which can only be produced
      in certain places. Oranges do not grow in a cold country; whereas iron ore
      cannot be obtained from a country which has no deposits of it beneath the
      soil. Coffee, cocoa, and rubber are grown only in warm climates. Cotton is
      grown in the United States, India, Egypt, Turkestan, etc.; from these
      lands it is exported to all parts of the world. Coal is found in Britain,
      Germany, the United States, Austria, and Russia; but there is no coal in
      Italy, and Italy is entirely dependent upon supplies of British and German
      coal. Wheat is exported to all other countries from the United States,
      India, Russia, and Rumania.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">On the other hand, certain countries are far advanced
      in their development, whilst others are backward. As a result of this,
      various products of urban industry in the more advanced lands are marketed
      in the backward countries. England, the United States, and Germany, in
      particular, send iron goods to all parts of the world. Germany is the
      chief exporter of chemical products.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Thus each country is dependent on the others; each
      sells to the others or buys from the others. How far this dependence can
      go, we may learn from the example of Britain. From three-fourths to
      four-fifths of the wheat needed by that country and half of the meat are
      imported, and in return for this the greater part of the goods produced in
      British factories has to be exported.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Let us now ask ourselves whether financial capital puts an end to
      competition in the world market. Does it create a worldwide organization
      in virtue of the fact that it unites the capitalists in individual
      countries? Obviously this is not the case. The anarchy of production and
      of competition within each specific country ceases more or less completely
      because the individual entrepreneurs unite to form a State capitalist
      trust. All the fiercer grows the struggle between the various State
      capitalist trusts. This is what always happens when capital is
      centralized. When the small fry are ruined, then of course the number of
      competitors diminishes, for only the big fish are left. Among these
      latter, the struggle is now conducted upon a larger scale; instead of a
      fight between individual manufacturers, there ensues a fight between the
      trusts. Of course the number of the trusts is less than the number of the
      individual manufacturers. The struggle, therefore, has become fiercer and
      more destructive. When the capitalists in any particular country have
      defeated their lesser opponents and have organized themselves into a State
      capitalist trust, the number of competitors is still further reduced. For
      the competitors are now these titanic capitalist powers. Such competition
      involves expenditure and waste upon an unprecedented scale. The fight
      between the State capitalist trusts expresses itself during 'peace' time
      in the rivalry of armaments. Ultimately it leads to a devastating war.</P>
    
    <P>Thus, WHEREAS FINANCIAL CAPITAL PUTS AN END TO COMPETITION WITHIN THE
      INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES, in due course and when the time is ripe, IT GIVES
      RISE TO A FIERCE AND EMBITTERED COMPETITION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS STATES.</P>
    
    <P>How does this come about? Why, moreover, does competition between
      capitalist countries lead in the end to an annexationist policy and to
      war? Why cannot the competition be peaceful? When two manufacturers
      compete with one another, they do not attack one another with knives, but
      attempt to steal one another's custom by peaceful methods. Why, then,
      should competition in the world market assume so savage a form? Why should
      the competitors have recourse to arms? To these questions we must give a
      detailed answer.</P>
    
    <P>First of all we must consider why it was necessary that the policy of
      the bourgeoisie should undergo a change concurrently with the transition
      from the old capitalism in which free competition prevailed, to the new
      capitalism in which financial capital holds sway.</P>
    
    <P>Let us begin with the so-called tariff policy. In the international
      struggle, the bourgeois governmental authorities, each aiming at the
      protection of its own capitalists, have long since adopted the use of
      customs tariffs as a means of struggle. When, for example, the Russian
      textile manufacturers were afraid that their British or German competitors
      would introduce British or German textiles into Russia and would cut
      prices, the Russian government was accommodating enough to impose an
      import duty upon British and German textiles. Of course this hindered the
      import of foreign products into Russia. Manufacturers usually declare that
      tariffs are necessary for the encouragement of home industry. If, however,
      we study the tariff policies of the various countries, we can see that the
      real aim was very different. During the last few decades, the countries in
      which the capitalists have raised the greatest clamour for high import
      tariffs, the countries in which such tariffs have been imposed, are the
      greatest and strongest countries in the world. The United States has led
      in this movement. Could foreign competition possibly injure these
      countries? 'What are you making such a row about, John? Who is hurting
      you? You are the aggressor!'</P>
    
    <P>What is the real meaning of all this? Let us suppose that in a certain
      country the textile industry has been monopolized by syndicates or trusts.
      What happens if an import duty is imposed? The syndicated capitalists kill
      two birds with one stone. In the first place they free themselves from
      foreign competition. Secondly, to the buyers of their own land, they are
      able to raise prices by an amount nearly equal to that of the tariff.
      Suppose the import duty on textiles to be two shillings per yard. In that
      case the textile magnates need have no hesitation in adding two shillings,
      or at least is 9d, per yard to the price of their goods. If the industry
      were not syndicated, the internal competition between the capitalists of
      the country we are considering would immediately lead to price cutting.
      But if there is a syndicate in control, it has no difficulty in raising
      prices, for the foreigner is kept out of the market by the customs
      barrier, and owing to the syndication of the industry there is no
      competition in the homeland. In so far as there are any imports, the State
      revenue benefits, while the syndicated manufacterers secure additional
      surplus value in consequence of the enhanced price. This can only take
      place where there is a syndicate or trust. But that is not the end of the
      affair. Thanks to these surplus profits, the syndicated manufacturers are
      able to introduce their goods into other countries and to sell them there
      below cost price simply in order to supplant all competitors in those
      countries. This is what they have actually done. It is a matter of common
      knowledge that the Russian Sugar Syndicate kept the price of sugar in
      Russia comparatively high, while selling sugar in England at a
      ridiculously low price in the hope of destroying competitors in that
      country. The saying became current that in England pigs were fed on
      Russian sugar. Thus the syndicated manufacturers, aided by the tariffs,
      are able at one and the same time to fleece their own countrymen and to
      bring foreign customers under their sway.</P>
    
    <P>The consequences are of great importance. It is obvious that the surplus
      profits of the syndicate will increase proportionally with the increase in
      the number of sheep to be shorn, with the increase in the number of those
      who are penned within the tariff barriers. If the customs area be a small
      one, the opportunity for profit-making will also be small. If, on the
      other hand, the customs area be large and populous, the opportunities for
      profit-making will be correspondingly extensive. In that case the surplus
      profits will be very large, so that it will be possible to act boldly in
      the world market, and to act there with the hope of a 'substantial
      success. Now, the customs area usually coincides with the area
      administered by the State. How can this latter be enlarged? By grabbing
      some foreign territory, by annexing it, by including it within one's own
      frontiers, within one's own governmental area. But this means war. It
      means that the dominion of syndicates is inevitably associated with wars
      of conquest. Every robber capitalist State endeavours to extend its
      frontiers; the extension is demanded by the interests of the trust
      magnates, by the interests of financial capital. Now, he who talks of
      extending frontiers really talks of waging war.</P>
    
    <P>In this manner, the tariff policy of the syndicate and trust magnates,
      in conjunction with their policy in the world market, leads to violent
      collisions. But here there are at work, tending towards war, additional
      causes.</P>
    
    <P>We have seen that the development of production results in the
      continuous accumulation of surplus value. In every land of advanced
      capitalist development there is therefore continually expanding a mass of
      <I>superfluous capital</I> which returns less profit than in
      comparatively backward countries. The larger the accumulation of
      superfluous capital in any country, the more vigorous are the endeavours
      to export capital, to invest it abroad. This aim is preeminently favoured
      by tariff policy. In fact, import duties greatly hinder the import of
      goods, When, for instance, the Russian manufacturers imposed high duties
      upon German goods, it became difficult for the German manufacturers to
      introduce their products into Russia. (We are speaking, of course, of
      things that happened when the manufacturers were in power, before the days
      of the Soviet Government.)</P>
    
    <P>But when they found it difficult to export their goods to Russia,
      another way was opened to the German capitalists. They began to introduce
      their <I>capital</I> into Russia. They built factories there; they bought
      shares in Russian undertakings, or they started new enterprises, supplying
      these with capital. Did the duties offer any hindrance? Nothing of the
      kind. Far from being a hindrance, they were a help; they positively
      promoted the influx of capital. For this reason. When the German
      capitalist has a factory in Russia, and when he too becomes a member of
      the 'Russian' syndicate, of course the Russian tariff helps him to earn
      surplus profit. The import duties are just as useful to him in fleecing
      the Russian public as they are to his Russian colleagues.</P>
    
    <P>Capital moves from one country into another not only in order to found
      new enterprises in the latter or to support those which already exist. In
      many cases the introduction of capital takes the form of a <I>loan to the
      government</I> of the country into which the capital is introduced, a loan
      at a fixed rate of interest. This means that the borrowing government
      increases its <I>national debt</I>, becomes indebted to the lending
      government. In such cases the debtor government usually undertakes to
      float all loans (and especially war loans) among the industrials of the
      creditor State. Thus vast quantities of capital pass from one State to
      another, partly incorporated in buildings and manufacturing enterprises,
      and partly taking the forms of State loans. Under the dominion of
      financial capital, the export of capital attains gigantic proportions.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">We will give certain figures which can still teach us a
      great deal, although they are a trifle out of date. In the year 1902, <I>France</I>
      had in twenty-six foreign States investments to the approximate amount of
      thirty-five milliards of francs: about half of the sum was in the form of
      State loans. The lion's share had gone to <I>Russia</I> (ten milliards).
      Parenthetically we may remark that this is why the French bourgeoisie is
      so furious because we Russians have cancelled the tsarist debts and have
      refused to pay the French usurers. By the year 1905 the sum of foreign
      capital imported into Russia had already exceeded forty milliards. In the
      year 1911 the foreign investments of <I>Britain</I> amounted to about
      sixteen hundred million pounds sterling; but if we include loans to the
      British colonies the sum invested overseas by the British amounted to
      three thousand million pounds sterling. <I>Germany</I>, prior to the war,
      had foreign investments amounting to something like thirty-five milliards
      of marks. - In a word, every capitalist government exports vast quantities
      of capital, in order, with the aid of this capital, to plunder foreign
      countries.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Moreover, the export of capital entails important consequences. The
      various powerful States begin to compete for the possession of those
      territorial areas or lesser States to which they wish to export capital.
      But here is another point to which we must draw attention. When
      capitalists export capital to a 'foreign' land, the risk involved is not
      that of certain quantities of commodities, but that of immense sums of
      money running into millions and milliards. Evidently, therefore, there
      will arise a strong desire to take completely into their hands the lesser
      countries in which they have invested capital, and to send <I>armies</I>
      to protect this capital. In the exporting States there thus arises the
      aspiration to subject these territories to their own governmental
      authorities, to do so at all hazards, simply to conquer them, to annex
      them by force. There ensues on the part of various strong, plundering
      States a competitive invasion of the weak territories, and it is clear
      that in the long run the marauders must come into mutual collision. Such
      clashes have actually taken place. In consequence, the export of capital
      has led to <I>war</I>. </P>
    
    <P>We have now some additional points to consider. With the growth of
      syndicates and the introduction of tariffs, the struggle for markets
      becomes greatly intensified. Already by the close of the nineteenth
      century there was no longer to be found any territory which remained quite
      free for the export of goods, or any region on which the capitalist had
      not yet set his foot. A great rise in the price of raw materials was
      beginning; metals, wool, timber, coal, and cotton were all growing dearer.
      During the years immediately preceding the war, there had been a fierce
      scramble for markets and <I>a struggle for new sources of raw materials</I>.
      The capitalists were nosing all over the world in quest of new coal mines,
      and new deposits of ore; they were hunting for new markets to which they
      could export the produce of their metal works, their weaving mills, and
      other factories; they wanted a new, a 'fresh' public to plunder. In former
      days, often enough, the competitors in any country consisted of firms
      whose competition was 'peaceful'; they remained on tolerably good terms.
      Under the sway of the banks and the trusts, a great change has taken
      place. Let us suppose that new deposits of copper have been discovered.
      They are immediately seized by a bank or a trust, which gets them wholly
      into its power, monopolizes them. The capitalists of other countries are
      left to console themselves with the adage: ' It's no use crying over spilt
      milk'. The same considerations apply to the struggle for markets. Let us
      suppose that capital from afar finds its way to a remote colony. The sale
      of goods is thereupon organized on the grand scale. The business usually
      falls into the hands of one gigantic firm. Opening branches in the place,
      it exercises pressure upon the local authorities, endeavouring in this
      way, and by a thousand wiles and stratagems, to corner the market, to
      secure a <I>monopoly</I>, to exclude all competitors. It is obvious that
      monopolist capital and the magnates of trusts and syndicates must act
      after their kind. We are not living in the ' good old times', but in an
      age of war between monopolist thieves and plunderers.</P>
    
    <P>Inevitably, therefore, CONCURRENTLY WITH THE GROWTH OF FINANCIAL CAPITAL
      THERE MUST OCCUR A GREAT INTENSIFICATION OF THE STRUGGLE FOR MARKETS AND
      RAW MATERIALS, AND THIS CANNOT FAIL TO LEAD TO VIOLENT COLLISIONS.</P>
    
    <P>During the last quarter of the nineteenth century the great robber
      States ruthlessly seized numerous regions belonging to lesser nations.
      Between 1876 and 1914 the so-called Great Powers annexed approximately ten
      million square miles of territory. In other words, they grabbed territory
      the total area of which is twice as large as that of Europe. The whole
      world had been partitioned among the big robbers; all other countries have
      become their colonies, their tributaries, or their slaves.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Here are some examples. <I>Great Britain </I>since
      1870 has annexed in Asia: Beluchistan, Burma, Wei-hai-wei, and the
      mainland adjacent to Hong-Kong; she has enlarged the Straits Settlements;
      she has acquired Cyprus and British North Borneo. In Australasia and
      Oceania she has annexed a number of islands, has occupied the eastern part
      of New Guinea, has annexed a great part of the Solomon Islands, the island
      of Tonga, etc. Her new possessions in Africa are: Egypt, the northern
      Soudan, Uganda, Eastern Equatorial Africa, British Somaliland, Zanzibar
      and Pemba. She has swallowed up the two Boer republics, has occupied
      Rhodesia and British Central Africa, has annexed Nigeria, and so on, and
      so on.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>France</I>, since 1870, has acquired Annam;
      conquered Tonkin; annexed Laos, Tunis, Madagascar, large portions of
      Sahara, Soudan, and the Guinea coast; has acquired areas on the Ivory
      Coast, in Dahomey, in Somaliland, etc. As a result, at the opening of the
      twentieth century the French colonies had an area which was nearly twenty
      times that of the mother country. (The British colonies at this date were
      more than one hundred times the size of the mother country.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>Germany </I>began to participate in the game of
      grab somewhat later, towards 1884; but within a brief time she was able to
      secure a considerable share of the spoil.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>Tsarist Russia </I> has likewise pursued a robber
      policy on a large scale. Of late years this was principally directed
      towards Asia, and here a collision with Japan ensued, for Japan was trying
      to plunder Asia from the other side.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The <I>United States </I> annexed numerous islands in
      the Caribbean Sea, and subsequently practised an annexationist policy on
      the American continent. Her attitude towards Mexico has been extremely
      threatening.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the year 1914 the homeland territories of the six
      Great Powers amounted in all to about six million square miles. The total
      area of their colonial possessions at the same date was approximately
      thirty million square miles.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>It need hardly be said that in the first instance such robberies were
      effected at the expense of the lesser countries, of those that were
      unprotected and weak. They were the first to be ruined. Just as in the
      struggle between the manufacturers and the independent artisans the latter
      were the first to succumb, so here. The great State trusts, the great
      capitalists organized for robbery, began by smashing the lesser
      governments and seizing their possessions. In the world economy, the
      centralization of capital advanced along the familar lines; the lesser
      States were ruined while the large robber States grew richer, larger, and
      more powerful.</P>
    
    <P>As soon as they had annexed the whole world, they began to struggle more
      fiercely among themselves. It was inevitable that the brigands should now
      quarrel over the loot, should fight for a redistribution of the world.
      Giant robber States remained, and a life-anddeath combat was to ensue
      among these survivors.</P>
    
    <P>THE POLICY OF CONQUEST WHICH FINANCIAL CAPITAL PURSUES IN THE STRUGGLE
      FOR MARKETS, FOR THE SOURCES OF RAW MATERIAL, AND FOR PLACES IN WHICH
      CAPITAL CAN BE INVESTED, IS KNOWN AS IMPERIALISM. Imperialism is born of
      financial capital. Just as a tiger cannot live upon grass, so financial
      capital cannot exist without a policy of conquest, spoliation, violence,
      and war. The essential desire of every one of the financial capitalist
      State trusts is to dominate the world; to establish a world empire,
      wherein the small group of capitalists belonging to the victorious nations
      shall hold undivided sway. The British imperialist, for example, dreams of
      a 'Greater Britain' which shall rule the whole world a world in which
      British trust magnates shall command the labour of Negroes and Russians,
      Germans and Chinese, Hindus and Armenians, slaves of all colours, black,
      white, yellow, and red. Britain is not far from the attainment of this
      ideal. But the more she grabs, the more she wants. The same thing happens
      with the imperialists of other nations. Russian imperialists dream of a
      'Greater Russia'; German imperialists dream of a 'Greater Germany'; and so
      on. By these 'great' ones, there is of course practised a shameless
      spoliation of all the rest.</P>
    
    <P>In this manner, therefore, the reign of financial capital must
      inevitably hurl all mankind into the bloody abyss of a war for the benefit
      of bankers and trust magnates; a war which is not fought for a people's
      own land but for the plunder of other lands; a war that is waged in order
      that the world may be subjugated by the financial capital of the
      conquering country. Such was the nature of the first great world war,
      during the years 1914 to 1918.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="028"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 28 Militarism</H4>
    
    <P>The rule of financial capital, of the bank barons and the trust
      magnates, finds expression in another phenomenon of the utmost importance,
      namely, in the unprecedented growth of expenditure on armaments - upon
      army, navy, and air force. The reason for this is obvious. In earlier days
      no brigand ever dreamed of world dominion. Now, however, the thoughts of
      the imperialists are seriously turned in this direction. Never before was
      there a contest between such monstrously strong State trusts. It is as an
      outcome of this new situation that the States have armed to the teeth. The
      Great Powers, professional robbers, kept their eyes on one another, for
      each dreaded lest his neighbour should attack him in W e rear. Every Great
      Power finds it necessary to maintain an army, not only for colonial
      service, not only for the repression of the workers, but in addition for
      the fight with fellow brigands. If any of the Powers introduces some new
      system of armaments, the other Powers eagerly endeavour to outdo the
      advance, for they fear to be left behind in the race. Thus ensues a mad
      rivalry in armaments, each State trying to outdo the rest. Gigantic
      enterprises are formed, the trusts of the cannon kings - Putilov, Krupp,
      Armstrong, Vickers, etc. The armament trusts make enormous profits; they
      are in league with the general staffs of the armies; they endeavour to
      throw fuel on the flames, to promote opportunities for conflict, seeing
      that the size of their profits depends upon war.</P>
    
    <P>Such was the crazy picture presented by capitalist society just before
      the great war. The State trusts were bristling with bayonets; on land, at
      sea, and in the air, everything had been made ready for the world
      struggle; in the various national budgets, the military and naval
      estimates assumed an ever larger place. In Britain, for example, in 1875
      the expenditure for war purposes comprised 386 per cent of the annual
      estimates for all purposes, this being not much more than one-third; by
      1907-8, the proportion had risen to 486 per cent, nearly half. In the USA,
      the proportion of national expenditure upon war purposes for the year 1908
      was 569 per cent, this being considerably more than half. It was the same
      in other lands. ' Prussian militarism' flourished in all the great State
      trusts. The armament kings were filling their treasuries. The whole world
      was hastening at an accelerating pace towards the bloodiest of all wars,
      towards the world war of imperialism.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Of exceptional interest was the armament rivalry
      between the British and the German bourgeoisies. In the year 1912 England
      decided to lay down three superdreadnoughts for every two laid down by
      Germany. In 1913, according to the naval estimates, the German North Sea
      fleet was to contain 17 dreadnoughts as against 21 British dreadnoughts;
      in 1916 the number was to be 26 German and 36 British; and so on.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the course of 20 years the expenditure had been
      doubled; in the case of Japan it had been multiplied by 13. The armament
      dance became even more lively shortly before the war. <I>France</I>
      expended for war purposes £450,000,000 in 1910, and £74,000,000
      in 1914. <I>Germany</I> spent £47,800,000 in 1906, and £94,300,000
      in 1914; that is to say, the expenditure was doubled in eight years. Even
      more extraordinary was the <I>British</I> expenditure. In 1900 this
      amounted to £49,900,000 ; in 1910 it was already £69,400,000 ;
      in 1914, the figures were £80,000,000. In the year 1913 the naval
      expenditure of Britain alone amounted to a larger sum than the total of
      what all the Powers had spent upon their fleets in 1886. As regards
      tsarist <I>Russia</I>, in the year 1892 the country spent upon armaments
      £29,300,000; in 1902, £42,100,000; in 1906, £52,900,000.

    <H4>§ 29 The imperialist war of 1914 to 1918</H4>
    
    <P>It was inevitable that the imperialist policy of the 'Great Powers'
      should sooner or later bring them into collison. Indisputably, the game of
      grab played by <I>all</I> the 'Great Powers' was the real cause of the
      war. Only an idiot can continue to believe that the war took place because
      the Serbs killed the Austrian crown prince or because the Germans invaded
      Belgium. At the outset, there was much dispute as to who was responsible
      for the catastrophe. The German capitalists maintained that Russia was the
      aggressor, whereas the Russians proclaimed everywhere that Germany began
      it. In Britain the word went round that the British had entered the
      struggle on behalf of 'gallant little Belgium'. In France, everyone was
      writing, screaming, and singing to prove how gloriously France was
      behaving in defence of the heroic Belgian nation. Simultaneously in
      Austria and Germany it was being trumpeted that these two countries were
      repelling a Cossack invasion and were waging a purely defensive war.</P>
    
    <P>From first to last, this was all nonsense; it was a fraud upon the
      workers. The fraud was necessary to enable the bourgeoisie to force their
      soldiers into battle. It was not the first time that the bourgeoisie had
      used such methods. We have previously seen that the trust magnates
      introduced high tariffs in order that, while plundering their
      fellowcountrymen, they could more readily conquer the foreign market. For
      them, therefore, the customs duties were a means of <I>attack</I>. But
      the bourgeoisie insisted that the duties were imposed in order to <I>protect</I>
      home industry. The same thing happened in the case of the war. The essence
      of the imperialist war which was to subject the world to the yoke of
      financial capital lay in this, that in it all were aggressors. Today this
      is as clear as clear can be. The lackeys of tsardom declared that they
      were defending themselves. But when the November revolution opened the
      ministerial archives and when the secret treaties were published,
      documentary evidence was furnished that both the tsar and Kerensky, in
      concert with the British and the French, were carrying on the war for the
      sake of the spoils, that they wanted to seize Constantinople, to plunder
      Turkey and Persia, and to steal Galicia from Austria. These things are now
      as plain as that two and two make four.</P>
    
    <P>The German imperialists were also in the end unmasked. Think of the
      Brest-Litovsk treaty; think of the plunderings in Poland, Lithuania,
      Ukraine, and Finland. The German revolution has likewise led to many
      disclosures. We have learned from documentary evidence that Germany was
      ready to attack for the sake of loot, and that she had designed to seize
      vast quantities of foreign territories and colonies. What about the
      'noble' Allies? They, too, have been fully unmasked. No one can believe in
      their nobility after the Versailles treaty. They have stripped Germany
      bare; they have demanded a war indemnity of twelve and a half milliards;
      they have taken the whole German fleet and all the German colonies; they
      have seized most of the locomotives and the milch cows as earnest for the
      indemnity. They have ravaged Russia in the north and in the south. They,
      too, have been fighting for plunder.</P>
    
    <P>The communist bolsheviks said all this at the very outset of the war.
      But at that time few believed them. Today, everyone outside a lunatic
      asylum can see that it is true. Financial capital is a greedy and
      bloodthirsty robber, no matter what the nationality of the capitalists may
      be. It is all the same whether they are Russians, Germans, Frenchmen,
      Englishmen, Japanese, or Americans.</P>
    
    <P>We see, then, that when we are talking of the imperialist war it is
      absurd to say that one imperialist is guilty and that another is
      blameless, to say that some imperialists were the aggressors and that
      others were on the defensive. All such assertions are made only in order
      to fool the workers. In actual fact, the Powers had all begun with
      aggressions upon the lesser peoples in whose lands they established their
      colonies; they all entertained designs of world-wide plunder; in every
      land alike the capitalists hoped to subject the whole world to the
      financial capital of their own country.</P>
    
    <P>Once it had started, the war could not fail to be a world war. The
      reason is plain. Almost all the world had been partitioned among the
      'Great Powers', and the Powers were intimately connected by the ties of a
      world-wide economic system. It is not surprising, therefore, that the war
      should involve all countries, should affect both hemispheres.</P>
    
    <P>Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Russia, Germany, AustriaHungary,
      Serbia, Bulgaria, Rumania, Montenegro, Japan, the United States, China,
      and a dozen petty States, were drawn into the bloody vortex. The total
      population of the world is somewhere near fifteen hundred millions. The
      whole of this vast population suffered directly or indirectly from the
      miseries of the war, which was imposed upon them by a small group of
      capitalist criminals. Never before had the world seen such immense armies
      as were now marshalled, never before has it known such monstrous
      instruments of death and destruction. Nor had the world ever witnessed
      such an irresistible mass of capital. Britain and France forced into the
      service of their money-bags, not only those who were British and French by
      birth, but to addition the thousands upon thousands of blackskinned and
      yellow-skinned colonial slaves. The civilized robbers did not hesitate to
      enrol cannibals among their soldiery, when cannibals were forthcoming. All
      this was done in the name of the most exalted ideals.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The war of 1914 had its prototypes in the colonial
      wars. Of this character were the following: the campaigns of the
      'civilized' Powers against China; the Spanish-American war; the
      RussoJapanese war in the year 1904 (on account of Korea, Port Arthur,
      Manchuria, etc.); the Tripolitan campaign of Italy in 1912; the Boer war
      at the turn of the century, when 'democratic' England brutally crushed the
      two South African republics. There were several occasions when a gigantic 
      international conflagration threatened. The partition of Africa nearly led
      to war between Britain and France (the Fashoda incident). Germany and
      France were embroiled over Morocco. Tsarist Russia at one time almost went
      to war with Britain in connexion with the partition of Central Asia.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">At the beginning of the world war, the conflict of
      interests between England and Germany concerning territorial predominance
      in Africa, Asia Minor, and the Balkans, came to the front. Events worked
      out in this way, that the allies of Britain were, first of all France,
      which hoped to wrest Alsace-Lorraine from Germany, and secondly Russia, in
      search of profiteering opportunities in the Balkans and Galicia. The
      robber imperialism of Germany secured its chief ally in Austria-Hungary.
      American imperialism entered the conflict comparatively late, after
      watching for a time how the European Powers were exhausting themselves by
      their struggles.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In addition to militarism, one of the most abominable
      methods employed in the rivalry between the imperialist Powers is <I>secret
      diplomacy</I>, which avails itself of secret treaties and plots, and which
      does not shrink from the use of the assassin's knife and the dynamiter's
      bomb. The real aims of the imperialist war were embodied in the secret
      treaties between Britain, France, and Russia, on the one hand, and between
      Germany, AustriaHungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria, on the other. It is
      manifest that secret agents of the Entente were privy to the assassination
      of the Austrian crown prince, which occurred five weeks before the war. On
      the other hand, German diplomacy was by no means disconcerted by the
      murder. For example, Rohrbach, the German imperialist, wrote: 'We may deem
      ourselves fortunate that the great anti-German conspiracy declared itself
      before the appointed time through the assassination of the archduke Franz
      Ferdinand. Two years later, the war would have been far more difficult.'
      The German provocative agents would have been perfectly willing to murder
      the German crown prince in order to bring about the war; nor would
      British, French, or Russian secret agents have shrunk from the
      assassination of this same prince.</FONT></P>

    <H4>§ 30 State capitalism and the classes</H4>
    
    <P>The conduct of the imperialist war was differentiated from that of all
      previous wars, not only by the dimensions of the conflict and by its
      devastating effects, but in addition by the fact that in every country
      actively engaged in the imperialist war the whole of economic life had to
      be subordinated to war purposes. In former conflicts the bourgeoisie could
      carry them on merely by providing funds. The world war, however, attained
      such huge proportions and affected such highly developed countries that
      money alone did not suffice. It became essential in this war that the
      steel foundries should devote themselves entirely to the making of heavy
      guns, whose calibre was continually being enlarged; that coal should be
      mined for war purposes alone; that metals, textiles, hides, everything,
      should be employed in war service. Naturally, therefore, the greatest hope
      of victory was for whichever of the State capitalist trusts could best
      harness production and transport to the chariot of war.</P>
    
    <P>How was this to be achieved? Manifestly, the only way in which it could
      be achieved was by the complete centralization of production. It would be
      necessary to arrange things in such a way that production would go on
      smoothly; that it would be well organized; that it would be entirely under
      the control of the fighters, that is to say of the general staff; that all
      the orders of those wearing epaulets and stars would be punctually carried
      out.</P>
    
    <P>How could the bourgeoisie do this? The matter was quite simple. To that
      end it was necessary that' the bourgeoisie should place private
      production, privately owned trusts and syndicates, at the disposal of the
      capitalist robber State. This is what they did for the duration of the
      war. Industry was ' mobilized' and 'militarized', that is to say it was
      placed under the orders of the State and of the military authorities. 'But
      how?' some of our readers will ask. ' In that way the bourgeoisie would
      surely forfeit its income? That would be nationalization! When everything
      has been handed over to the State, where will the bourgeoisie come in, and
      how will the capitalists reconcile themselves to such a condition 'of
      affairs?' It is an actual fact that the bourgeoisie agreed to the
      arrangement. But there is nothing very remarkable in that, for the
      privately owned syndicates and trusts were not handed over to the workers'
      State, but to the imperialist State, the State which belonged to the
      bourgeoisie. Was there anything to alarm the bourgeoisie in such a
      prospect? The capitalists simply transferred their possessions from one
      pocket to another; the possessions remained as large as ever.</P>
    
    <P>We must never forget the class character of the State. The State must
      not be conceived as constituting a 'third power' standing above the
      classes; from head to foot it is a class organization. Under the
      dictatorship of the workers it is a working-class organization. Under the
      dominion of the bourgeoisie it is just as definitely an <I>economic </I>organization
      as is a trust or a syndicate.</P>
    
    <P>We see, then, that when the bourgeoisie handed over the privately owned
      syndicates and trusts to the State, it handed them over to its own State,
      to the robber capitalist State and not to the proletarian State;
      consequently it had nothing to lose by the change. Is it not precisely the
      same thing to a manufacturer, whom we may call Schulz or Smith, whether he
      receives his profits from the counting-house of a syndicate or from a
      State-bank? Far from losing by the change, the bourgeoisie actually
      gained. There was a gain because, through the State centralization of
      industry, the war machine was enabled to work to better effect, and there
      was a greater chance of winning the war of rapine.</P>
    
    <P>It is not surprising, therefore, that in nearly all capitalist countries
      there took place during the war a development of State <I>capitalism </I>in
      the place of the capitalism of private syndicates or trusts. Germany, for
      example, gained many successes and was able for a lengthy period to resist
      attack from enemies of a greatly superior strength, simply because the
      German bourgeoisie was so successful in the organization of its State
      capitalism.</P>
    
    <P>The change to State capitalism was effected in various ways. In most
      cases a State monopoly of production and trade was instituted. This
      implied that production and trade were placed wholly in the hands of the
      bourgeois State. Sometimes the transformation was not effected all at
      once, but by instalments. This took place when the State merely bought
      some of the shares of the syndicate or trust.</P>
    
    <P>An enterprise in which this had taken place was half private and half a
      State affair, but the bourgeois State held the leading strings.
      Furthermore, even when certain enterprises remained in private hands, they
      were often subjected to governmental control. Some enterprises were by
      special legislation forced to buy their raw materials from certain others,
      while the latter had to sell to the former in specified quantities and at
      fixed prices. The State prescribed working methods, specified what
      materials were to be used, and rationed these materials. Thus, in place of
      private capitalism, State capitalism came into being.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Under State capitalism, instead of the separate
      organizations of the bourgeoisie there now flourishes a united
      organization, the State organization. Down to the time of the war there
      existed in any capitalist country the State organization of the
      bourgeoisie, and there also existed separately from the State large
      numbers of bourgeois organizations, such as syndicates, trusts, societies
      of entrepreneurs, landowners' organizations, political parties,
      journalists' unions, learned societies, artists' clubs, the church,
      societies for the clergy, Boy Scouts and cadet corps (White Guard
      organizations of youth), private detective bureaux, etc. Under State
      capitalism all these separate organizations fuse with the bourgeois State;
      they become, as it were, State departments, and they work in accordance
      with a general plan, subject to the 'high command'; in the mines and
      factories they do whatever is ordered by the general staff; they write in 
      the newspapers under the orders of the general staff; they preach in the
      churches whatever will be useful to the robbers of the general staff;
      their pictures, their books, and their poems, are produced under the
      orders of the general staff; they invent machinery, weapons, poison gas,
      etc., to meet the needs of the general staff. In this manner the whole of
      life is militarized in order to secure for the bourgeoisie the continued
      receipt of its filthy lucre.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>State capitalism signifies an enormous accession of strength to the
      great bourgeoisie. Just as under the working-class dictatorship, in the
      workers' State, the working class is more powerful in proportion as the
      soviet authority, the trade unions, the Communist Party, etc., work more
      harmoniously together, so under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie the
      capitalist class is strong in proportion to the success with which all the
      bourgeois organizations pull together. State capitalism, centralizing all
      these organizations, converting them all into the instruments of a single,
      united organization, contributes immensely to the power of capital.
      Bourgeois dictatorship attains its climax in State capitalism.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">State capitalism flourished during the war in all the
      large capitalist countries. In tsarist Russia, too, it began to make its
      way (in the form of war industry committees, monopolies, etc.).
      Subsequently, however, the Russian bourgeoisie, alarmed by the revolution
      of March, 1917, became afraid lest productive industry should pass into
      the hands of the proletariat together with the State authority. For this
      reason, after the March revolution, the bourgeoisie did not merely refrain
      from attempts to organize production, but positively sabotaged industry.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">We see that State capitalism, far from putting an end
      to exploitation, actually increases the power of the bourgeoisie.
      Nevertheless the Scheidemannites in Germany, and social solidarians in
      other lands, have contended that this forced labour is socialism. As soon,
      they say, as everything is in the hands of the State, socialism will be
      realized. They fail to see that in such a system the State is not a
      proletarian State, since it is in the hands of those who are the malicious
      and deadly enemies of the proletariat.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>State capitalism uniting and organizing the bourgeoisie, increasing the
      power of capitalism, has, of course, greatly weakened the working class.
      Under State capitalism the workers became the white slaves of the
      capitalist State. They were deprived of the right to strike; they were
      mobilized and militarized; everyone who raised his voice against the war
      was hauled before the courts and sentenced as a traitor. In many countries
      the workers were deprived of all freedom of movement, being forbidden to
      transfer from one enterprise to another. ' Free' wage workers were reduced
      to serfdom; they were doomed to perish on the battlefields, not on behalf
      of their own cause but on behalf of that of their enemies. They were
      doomed to work themselves to death, not for their own sake or for that of
      their comrades or their children, but for the sake of their oppressors.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="031"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 31 The collapse of capitalism, and the classes</H4>
    
    <P>In this manner, at the outset, the war contributed to the centralization
      and organization of the capitalist economy. That which the syndicates, the
      banks, the trusts, and the combined undertakings, had not yet fully
      achieved, was speedily finished by State capitalism. It created a network
      out of all the organs regulating production and distribution. Thus it
      prepared the ground even more fully than before for the time when the
      proletariat would be able to take the now centralized large-scale
      production into its own hands.</P>
    
    <P>It was inevitable that the war, whose burden pressed so heavily on the
      working class, should in due course lead to a rising of the proletarian
      masses. The leading characteristic of the war was that it was murderous to
      an unparalleled degree. The levying of troops advanced with giant strides.
      The proletariat was positively decimated on the battlefields. The reports
      show that down to March, 1917, the number of dead, wounded, and missing
      totalled 25 millions; by 1 January, 1918, the number of the killed had
      been approximately 8 millions. If we assume the average weight of a
      soldier to 750 lb., this means that between 1 August 1914, and 1 January
      1918, the capitalists had brought to market twelve hundred million pounds
      of putrid human flesh. To estimate the real loss on human beings, we must
      add a few millions permanently invalided. Considering syphilis alone, this
      disease has been diffused by the war to an almost incredible extent, so
      that infection is now nearly universal. In consequence of the war people
      have become far less fit physically; the most healthy, the most effective
      elements, those which formed the flower of the nations, have been
      destroyed. It need hardly be said that the brunt of the losses was borne
      by the workers and the peasants.</P>
    
    <P>In the great centres of the warring States we can find whole communities
      of those who have been crippled and monstrously mutilated; men whose faces
      have been shot away, wearing masks, sit in misery as living tokens to the
      delights of bourgeois civilization.</P>
    
    <P>The proletariat, however, was not simply massacred at the front. In
      addition, intolerable burdens were laid upon the shoulders of those who
      remained alive. The war necessitated a frenzied expenditure. At the very
      time when the factory owners were piling up immense profits which became
      distinctively known as ' war profits', the workers were being subjected to
      heavy taxation for war purposes. The cost of the war continued to increase
      beyond measure. In the autumn of 1979, at the peace conference, the French
      minister for finance declared that the war had cost the belligerents more
      than a trillion francs. The significance of such figures is far from easy
      to grasp. In former days the number of miles between one star and another
      was stated in similar terms. Now they are used to figure out the cost of
      these years of criminal slaughter. A trillion is a million millions. Such
      has been the upshot of the war devised by the capitalists. According to 
      another estimate, the cost of the war was as follows</P>

    <P>Subsequently, the costs of the war increased even more, attaining
      figures astounding in their magnitude. Vast sums have to be raised in
      order to meet these costs. Naturally, therefore, the capitalist States
      have already begun to impose heavy burdens on the working class: either by
      direct taxation; or by taxes on articles of consumption; or, finally, in
      order to make the bourgeoisie too contribute by a deliberate advance in
      the price of goods from patriotic motives. Prices have continued to rise.
      But the manufacturers, and especially those who have been manufacturing
      things wanted for the war, have pocketed unheard-of gains.</P>

      more than double the previous dividends, and in certain undertakings the
      profits were positively fabulous. Here are some of the figures: the
      naphtha firm of the Mirosyev Brothers paid 40 per cent; Danshevsky Ltd, 30
      per cent; the Kalfa tobacco factory, 30 per cent; and so on. In <I>Germany</I>,
      during the years 1913 and 1914, the net profits in four branches of
      industry, namely chemical works, explosives, metal works, and motor car
      works, amounted to 133 millions; during the years 1915 and 1916 the total
      profits in the same branches amounted to 259 millions, practically double.
      In the <I>United States </I> the profits of the Steel Trust during the
      first half of 1916 were three times as great as the profits during the
      first half of 1915. The total profits of the Trust in 1915 were 98 million
      dollars; in the year 1917 they were 478 million dollars. Dividends of 200
      per cent were several times declared. Many more examples could be given.
      There was a similar huge increase in banking profits. During the war, the
      small fry among the manufacturers were ruined, whilst the big sharks were
      incredibly enriched. As for the proletariat, this fell under the yoke of
      taxes and rising prices.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The chief articles produced during the war were shrapnel, shells, high
      explosives, heavy guns, tanks, aeroplanes, poison gas, gunpowder, etc. An
      incredible quantity of these requisites was manufactured. In the United
      States, new towns grew up like mushrooms round the powder factories. The
      owners of the new powder factories, in their eagerness for profits,
      conducted work so carelessly that explosions were common. Of course the
      manufacturers of munitions made huge profits, so that their businesses
      flourished amazingly. But as far as the common people were concerned,
      matters grew continually worse. Things of real value, such as can be
      eaten, worn, etc., were produced in ever-diminishing quantities. With
      powder and shot people can shoot and can destroy, but powder and shot are
      of no use for food or clothing. The whole strength of the belligerents
      was, however, devoted to the production of powder and other instruments of
      death. The production of ordinary utilities was increasingly reduced. The
      workers were drafted into the armies, and productive industry was entirely
      turned to the purposes of war. There was continually a greater dearth of
      useful goods. Hence arose shortage of food and exorbitant prices. LACK OF
      BREAD, LACK OF COAL, LACK OF ALL USEFUL GOODS, AND MOREOVER A WORLDWIDE
      LACK IN CONJUNCTION WITH WORLD-WIDE EXHAUSTION, SUCH WERE THE MAIN
      CONSEQUENCES OF THE CRIMINAL IMPERIALIST WAR.</P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Owing to the lack of coal, the condition of industry
      throughout the world was desperate. In Central and Western Europe the main
      provider of coal was Britain. In Britain by the middle of 1918 the
      production of coal was reduced by 13 per cent. Already in 1917 the
      principal industries were practically without supplies of coal. Electrical
      works were receiving only one-sixth of the coal they needed, while textile
      undertakings were receiving only oneeleventh of the pre-war supply. At the
      time of the 'peace' conference at Versailles nearly all the countries in
      the world were affected by a terrible coal crisis. Factories were closed
      down for lack of fuel and the railway services were reduced. An extensive
      disorganization of industry and transport ensued.</FONT></P>

      = 1 ton]. Kerensky's administration promised to supply 6,000,000 poods,

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Thus in the course of the war, even in Britain, prices
      were more than doubled, and the increase in wages was very far from
      keeping pace with the increase in the cost of living. In other countries,
      conditions were very much worse. They were especially bad in Russia, where
      the war proved positively ruinous, and where the country was reduced to
      the position of a tattered beggar dependent upon the favour of the lords
      of capital.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the <I>United States</I>, which was even less
      affected by the war than Britain, between 1913 and 19 18 the prices of
      fifteen leading products increased by 160 per cent, while during the same
      period the rise in wages was only 80 per cent.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>At length, even production for war purposes began to languish for lack
      of coal, steel, and other essentials. In every land, the United States
      alone excepted, poverty was rife; hunger, cold, and ruin, were advancing
      all over the globe. It need hardly be said that the chief sufferers from
      all these evils were the members of the working class, who thereupon
      attempted to protest. Upon them, now, war was declared, a war waged with
      the whole strength of the bourgeois robber States. In every land, in
      republican countries just as much as in monarchial, the working class was
      subjected to unexampled persecutions. The workers were not only deprived
      of the right to strike, but the slightest movement of protest was
      ruthlessly suppressed. In this way the dominion of capitalism led to <I>civil
      war between the classes</I>.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The resolution of the Third International concerning
      the White Terror gives a striking picture of the persecution of the
      workers during the war. It runs as follows: 'At the very outset of the
      war, the ruling classes who on the battlefields have slaughtered more than
      ten million men and have crippled and mutilated a vast number in addition
      - instituted in internal affairs a régime of bloody dictatorship (a
      bourgeois dictatorship). In Russia, the tsarist government shot and hanged
      the workers, organized antiJewish pogroms, and stifled every protest. The
      Austrian government savagely suppressed the risings of the peasants and
      the workers in Ukraine and Bohemia. The British bourgeoisie . butchered
      some of the finest representatives of the Irish people. The German
      imperialists breathed threatenings and slaughter, and the insurgent
      bluejackets were the first victims of their brutal wrath. In France, the
      authorities shot down the Russian soldiers who refused to defend the
      financial interests of the French bankers. In the United States, the
      bourgeoisie lynched the internationalists, sentenced many of the best
      proletarians to twenty years' imprisonment and shot down workers on
      strike.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The capitalist system was breaking down. The anarchy of
      production had led to the war, and this had induced an enormous
      accentuation of the class conflict. Thus the war led to the revolution.
      Capitalism was beginning to disintegrate in two fundamental ways. (Refer
      to <A HREF="01.htm#013">§13</A>). The era of the collapse of
      capitalism had set in. Let us examine this collapse more closely.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Capitalist society was constructed upon one model
      throughout. A factory was organized just like a government office or like
      a division of the imperial army. At the top were the rich who commanded;
      at the bottom were the poor, the workers and the salariat, who obeyed; in
      between were the superintending engineers, the ' non-commissioned
      officers' the foremen, the higher grade employees, etc. It follows,
      therefore, that capitalist society can maintain itself in being so long
      only as the private soldier (drawn from the ranks of the workers) obeys
      the orders of the officer (drawn from the aristocracy, the landed gentry,
      or the wealthier bourgeoisie); so long only as in the government offices
      the subordinates obey the orders of their wealthy chiefs; and so long only
      as in the factories the workers continue to obey the highly paid managers
      or the factory owners who live upon surplus value. But as soon as the
      working masses realize that they are nothing but pawns in the hands of
      their enemies, the ties are broken that bind the private soldier to the
      service of the officer and that bind the worker to the service of the
      factory owner. The workers cease to attend to the orders of the factory
      owner; the private soldiers cease to attend to the orders of their
      officers; the civil servants cease to attend to the orders of their
      chiefs. Then begins the period in which the <I>old </I>discipline is
      relaxed, that discipline which enabled the rich to rule the poor, which
      enabled the bourgeoisie to fleece the workers. This period will inevitably
      continue until the new class (the proletariat) has subjugated the
      bourgeoisie, has forced the bourgeoisie to serve the workers, has
      established a <I>new</I> discipline.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Such a condition of affairs, in which the old order has
      been destroyed and the new order has not yet been created, can be ended in
      no other way than by the complete victory of the proletariat in the civil
      war.</FONT></P>

    <H4>§ 32 The civil war</H4>
    
    <P>Civil war is an extremely intensified class war, and it occurs when the
      class war has led to revolution. The imperialist world war between the two
      groups of bourgeois States, the war waged for the repartition of the
      world, was carried on by the slaves of capital. It imposed such heavy
      burdens upon the workers that the class war was transformed into a civil
      war fought by the oppressed against their oppressors, the war which Marx
      had declared to be the only just war.</P>
    
    <P>It was perfectly natural that capitalism should culminate in civil war,
      that the imperialist war between the bourgeois States should lead to a war
      between the classes. Our party foretold this development at the very
      outset of the war, in the year 1914, when no one dreamed of revolution.
      Nevertheless it was manifest that the intolerable burdens which the war
      imposed upon the working class must lead to an insurrection of the
      proletariat. It was, moreover, perfectly clear that the bourgeoisie could
      not possibly ensure a lasting peace, for the conflict of interests between
      the various groups of plunderers was too vital.</P>
    
    <P>Our predictions have been entirely fulfilled. After the terrible years
      of war, brutality, and devastation, a civil war against the oppressors
      began. This civil war was opened by the Russian revolutions of March and
      November, 1917; it was continued by the Finnish revolution, the Hungarian
      revolution, the Austrian revolution, and the German revolution;
      revolutions in other countries have begun. The bourgeoisies cannot bring
      about a lasting peace. The Allies overcame Germany in November 1918; the
      robbers' peace of Versailles was signed many months later; but no one
      knows when the final settlement will be effected. It is plain to all that
      the peace of Versailles is not lasting. Quarrels have already broken out
      between the Jugoslavs and the Italians, between the Poles and the
      Czechoslovaks, between the Poles and the Lithuanians, between the Latvians
      and the Germans. In addition, all the bourgeois States have combined to
      attack the republic of the victorious Russian workers. Thus the
      imperialist war is ending in a civil war, of which the inevitable outcome
      will be the victory of the proletariat.</P>
    
    <P>The civil war is not the result of any party's caprice; its coming has
      been no chance matter. The civil war is a manifestation of the revolution,
      and the revolution was absolutely inevitable because the robber war of the
      imperialists had opened the eyes of the broad masses of the workers.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">To think that the revolution can take place without
      civil war is equivalent to thinking that there can be a 'peaceful'
      revolution. Anyone who believes this (as the mensheviks who utter laments
      concerning the hurtfulness of civil war believe it) is turning away from
      Marx to those antediluvian socialists who imagine that the factory owners
      can be talked over. We might just as well hope by petting a tiger to
      persuade the animal to live upon grass and to leave cattle alone ! Marx
      was an advocate of the civil war, that is to say the fight of the armed
      proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Writing with reference to the Paris
      Commune (the rising of the Parisian workers in the year 1871), Marx
      declares that the communards had not been sufficiently resolute. He uses
      reproachful terms in the manifesto of the First International. [The Civil
      War in France.] We read: 'Even the sergents-de-ville, instead of being
      disarmed and locked up, as ought to have been done, found the gates of
      Paris flung wide open, for their safe retreat to Versailles. The men of
      the &quot;party of order&quot; ' [this was the name then given to the
      counterrevolutionaries] 'were not only left unharmed; they were allowed to
      rally and quietly to seize more than one stronghold in the very heart of
      Paris....In its reluctance to continue the civil war opened by Thiers'
      [the French counterpart of Denikin] '...the Central Committee made a grave
      mistake. It was urgently necessary to attack Versailles....to put an end,
      once for all, to the plots of Thiers and the Rurals. Instead of this, the
      &quot;party of order&quot; was again allowed to test its strength at the
      ballot-box, in the communal elections of March 26th.' Here Marx clearly
      advocates the armed suppression of the counterrevolution; he advocates
      civil war. Engels, too, wrote as follows: 'Would the Commune of Paris have
      held its ground for a single day unless it had put its trust in the
      authority of the armed people against the bourgeoisie? Have we not,
      rather, the right to blame the Commune for having made so little use of 
      its powers of compulsion?' And this is how Engels defines the term
      revolution 'A revolution is an act in which one part of the population
      imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets, and
      artillery.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">We see that the leaders of socialism took a very
      serious view of revolution. They understood that the proletariat cannot
      peacefully persuade the bourgeoisie; they understood that the workers must
      impose their will by means of victory in a civil war fought with 'rifles,
      bayonets, and artillery'.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Civil war ranges one against another, with arms in their hands, the two
      classes of capitalist society, the two classes whose interests are
      diametrically opposed. The fact that capitalist society is split up into
      two parts, that it essentially consists of at least two distinct societies
      this fact is obscured at ordinary times. For what reason? Because the
      slaves passively obey their masters. But in time of civil war this passive
      obedience comes to an end, and the oppressed portion of society rises
      against the oppressors. It is obvious that in such circumstances the
      classes cannot possibly ' live harmoniously side by side'. The army splits
      up into White Guards consisting of the aristocracy, the bourgeoisie, the
      richer members of the professional classes, and so on, and Red Guards
      consisting of workers and peasants. It is now impossible that there should
      be a parliament of any sort in which factory owners and workers sit
      together. How can they meet 'peacefully' in parliament when they are
      shooting one another in the streets? In time of civil war, class takes up
      arms against class. This is why the struggle can only end through a
      victory of one of the two classes. It cannot end in an agreement, or in
      any sort of compromise. Such a view has been fully confirmed by the
      experience of civil war in Russia and elsewhere (Germany and Hungary).
      There must speedily ensue a dictatorship, either of the proletariat or of
      the bourgeoisie. Government by the middle classes and their parties (the
      Social Revolutionary Party, the Menshevik Party, etc.) is merely a bridge
      by which we pass to one side or the other. When the Soviet Government of
      Hungary was overthrown with the aid of the mensheviks, its place was taken
      for a brief space by a ' coalition', but then an absolutist reactionary
      government was established. From time to time the Constitutional Social
      Revolutionary Party would come to the top in Ufa, Transvolgia, or Siberia,
      but within twenty-four hours it was always overthrown by Admiral Kolchak,
      who was supported by the great capitalists and the landlords. This meant
      the establishment of a landlordcapitalist dictatorship instead of a
      worker-peasant dictatorship. A DECISIVE VICTORY OVER THE ENEMY AND THE
      REALIZATION OF THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT - SUCH WILL BE THE
      INEVITABLE OUTCOME OF THE WORLD-WIDE CIVIL WAR.</P>

    <H4>§ 33 The forms of civil war and its costs</H4>
    
    <P>The epoch of civil wars was ushered in by the Russian revolution, itself
      no more than the herald, the beginning, of a revolution that will be
      general and world-wide. The revolution began earlier in Russia than
      elsewhere because in Russia the de composition of capitalism set in
      earlier. The Russian bourgeoisie and the Russian landowning class hoped
      for the conquest of Constantinople and Galicia. In conjunction with their
      allies they participated in the cooking of the hell's broth of 1914
      Through their weakness and lack of organization, they were the first to
      collapse, so that chaos and famine appeared in Russia earlier than
      elsewhere. For that reason it was especially easy for the Russian
      proletariat to deal with its class enemies. This is why the Russian
      workers were the first to gain a decisive victory, the first to establish
      their dictatorship.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">We must not infer that the Russian communist revolution
      is the most thoroughgoing revolution in the world; nor must we infer that
      the less developed capitalism is in any country, the more 'revolutionary'
      will be that country and the nearer to communism. The logical consequence
      of such a view would be that the complete realization of socialism would
      first occur in China, Persia, Turkey, and other countries where
      practically no proletariat has as yet come into existence. Were this the
      case, the teaching of Marx would be completely falsified.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Anyone who reasons thus, is confusing two things: on
      the one hand, the beginning of the revolution; on the other hand, its
      character, its degree of thoroughness. The revolution began earlier in
      Russia owing to the immaturity and weakness of capitalist development in
      that country. But precisely because of that immaturity and weakness,
      precisely because Russia is a backward country where the proletariat is in
      a minority, where there is a large number of petty traders, and so on, it
      is difficult for us to organize an integral communist economy. In England
      the revolution will come later. But there the proletariat, after its
      victory, will organize communism more swiftly. In Britain the proletariat
      constitutes a very large majority of the population; the workers are
      accustomed to collective labour; production is highly centralized. That is
      why the revolution will come later in England, but why, when it comes, it
      will be more highly developed, more far-reaching than ours.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Many persons have supposed that the ferocious character of our civil war
      is due to the backwardness of our country, or to some peculiar' Asiatic'
      traits. The opponents of revolution in western Europe are in the habit of
      saying that 'Asiatic socialism' flourishes in Russia, and that in
      'civilized' lands a revolutionary change will be effected without
      atrocities. Obviously this is all nonsense. Where capitalist development
      is far advanced, the resistance of the bourgeoisie will be more stubborn.
      The intelligentsia (the professional classes, the technicians, the
      managing engineers, the army officers, etc.) are more strongly solidarized
      with capital, and are for that reason far more hostile to communism. In
      such countries, therefore, the civil war will inevitably assume a more
      savage form than in Russia. The course of the German revolution has
      actually proved that the war assumes harsher forms in countries where
      capitalist development is farther advanced.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Those who complain of the bolshevist Terror forget that
      the bourgeoisie sticks at nothing for the protection of its money-bags.
      With reference to this matter, the resolution passed by the first congress
      of the Third International runs as follows:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">'When the imperialist war was beginning to be
      transformed into civil war, and when for the governing class (the greatest
      criminals known to history) the danger was imminent that its merciless régime
      would collapse, its brutality grew greater than ever....</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">'Russian generals, living embodiments of the tsarist
      system, organized the shooting down of the workers on a large scale, and
      continue to do this with the direct or indirect connivance of the traitors
      to socialism. When the Social Revolutionary Party and the Menshevik Party
      were in power, the prisons were filled with thousands of workers and
      peasants, and the generals had entire regiments shot for disobedience.
      Krasnov and Denikin, with the kind cooperation of the allied governments,
      have slaughtered the workers by tens of thousands, hanging them, or
      shooting every tenth man. As a deterrent, they often leave whole rows of
      gibbeted corpses hanging for three days. In Ural and Transvolgia the bands
      of Czecho-Slovak White Guards have cut off prisoners' hands and feet, have
      drowned prisoners in the Volga, have buried them alive. In Siberia the
      generals have slaughtered communists by the thousand and have butchered
      innumerable workers and peasants.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">'The German and Austrian bourgeois made an open display
      of their bestial tendencies in Ukraine, where they hanged on portable iron
      gallows the workers and peasants whom they had robbed, and hanged
      communists who were their own fellow-countrymen, our Austrian and German
      comrades. In Finland, one of the homes of bourgeois democracy, they helped
      the Finnish bourgeois to shoot from 13,000 to 14,000 proletarians and to
      torture more than 15,000 to death in the prisons. In Helsingfors, wishing
      to protect themselves from machine-gun fire, they drove women and children
      in front of their ranks. Thanks to their aid, the Finnish White Guards and
      their Swedish assistants were able to enjoy this orgy of blood when they
      had conquered the Finnish proletariat. In Tammerfors, they compelled women
      and children to dig their own graves before being slaughtered. In Viborg,
      they killed thousands of Russians, men, women and children.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">'Within their own frontiers the German bourgeois and
      the German Social Democrats, manifested an even greater degree of
      reactionary violence. Risings of the communist workers were drowned in
      blood; Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were brutally murdered; the
      Spartacist workers were massacred. The flag under which the bourgeoisie
      marches is the flag of the White Terror - the mass Terror and the
      individual Terror.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">'We see the same picture in other lands. In democratic
      Switzerland everything is ready for the punishment of the workers should
      they dare to infringe capitalist law. In America it would seem that the
      prison, lynch law, and the electric chair, are the chosen symbols of
      democracy and freedom. In Hungary and Britain, in Czecho-Slovakia and
      Poland - everywhere it is the same. The bourgeois assassins do not shrink
      from the most atrocious actions. In the hope of strengthening their régime
      they encourage jingoism, and they organize abominable anti-Jewish pogroms,
      even worse than those which used to be organized by the tsarist
      police....When the Polish reactionaries and the &quot;socialist&quot;
      rabble murdered the representatives of the Russian Red Cross, this was but
      an additional drop in the ocean of crimes and atrocities perpetrated by
      bourgeois cannibalism in its death agony.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P>As the civil war develops, it assumes new forms. When in any country the
      proletariat is oppressed beyond measure, it leads this war by a revolt
      against the State authority of the bourgeoisie. Now let us suppose that in
      one country or another the proletariat has been victorious and has taken
      the State authority into its own hands. What happens in this case? The
      proletariat has the organized State power at its service, it has the
      proletarian army, it has the entire apparatus of power. Then the
      proletariat has to fight with the bourgeoisie of its own land, which
      organizes plots and risings against the proletarian authority.
      Furthermore, the proletariat organized as the State has to fight with
      bourgeois States. Here the civil war assumes a new form, for the class war
      becomes war in the ordinary sense when the proletarian State is fighting
      against bourgeois States; the workers are now not simply fighting against
      the bourgeoisie, but the workers' State is engaged in formal warfare
      against the imperialist States of capital. This war is carried on, not for
      the seizure of others' goods, but for the victory of communism, for the
      dictatorship of the working class.</P>
    
    <P>This is what has actually occurred. After the Russian revolution of
      November, 1917, the Soviet Government was attacked upon all sides by the
      capitalists; by the British, the Germans, and the French, by the Americans
      and the Japanese, and so on. The more the workers of other lands became
      infected by the example of the Russian revolution, the more firmly did
      international capitalism close its ranks against the revolution, the more
      vigorously did it attempt to establish a robber alliance of capitalists
      against the proletariat.</P>
    
    <P>Upon the initiative of the trickster Wilson, the leader of American
      capitalism, an attempt to form such an alliance was made at the so-called
      peace conference of Versailles. The robber alliance was christened the
      League of Nations, this being intended to signify that it was a 'league of
      peoples'. In reality it is not a league of peoples, but a league of the
      capitalists of various countries and of their State authorities.</P>
    
    <P>This league is in the nature of an attempt to form a worldwide trust of
      monstrous proportions which shall embrace the whole surface of the globe
      in a grasp of universal exploitation, and which, on the other hand, shall
      crush with the utmost ferocity the working class movement of revolt and
      revolution. It is pure fable to say that the League of Nations has been
      founded to promote the cause of peace. In actual fact it has a twofold
      aim: the ruthless exploitation of the proletariat throughout the world, of
      all colonies and of the colonial slaves; and the crushing of the incipient
      world revolution.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the League of Nations, the USA, which became
      inordinately rich during the war, plays the first fiddle. All the
      bourgeois States of Europe are now heavily indebted to America. The United
      States is very powerful for the additional reason that she has vast
      quantities of raw materials and fuel, and is a great wheat-producing
      country. She wishes to use these advantages in such a way as to make all
      her fellow robbers dependent on her. Infallibly she will become the leader
       of the League of Nations.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Very interesting is the way in which the United States
      veils its preeminently predatory policy behind a cloud of fine phrases.
      When, in pursuit of plunder, she entered the war, her watchwords were '
      the salvation of mankind' ' the rescue of the enslaved peoples', and so
      on. It suited the United States that Europe should be disintegrated,
      should consist of dozens of petty lands, formally 'independent' but
      substantially dependent upon America. This predatory interest was masked
      by an exalted phrase concerning ' the right of the nations to
      selfdetermination'. The capitalist gendarmerie, the White Guards, and the
      White Police, which, according to Wilson's plan, were to be ready
      everywhere to crush the revolution, would exist to ensure punishment for
      'breaches of the peace'. In the year 1919 all the imperialists suddenly
      became pacifically minded, and raised a clamour to the effect that the
      bolsheviks were the real imperialists, the true enemies of peace. Plans
      for the stifling of the revolution masqueraded as zeal for peace and
      democracy.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The League of Nations has already shown itself to be an
      international policeman and executioner. Its executive officers overthrew
      the Soviet Republics in Hungary and Bavaria. They have continually
      endeavoured to crush the Russian proletariat; in the north and in the
      south, in the west and in the east of Russia, the British, the American,
      the Japanese, the French, and other armies have made common cause with the
      Russian enemies of the working class. The League of Nations used black
      troops against the Russian and Hungarian workers (in Odessa and in
      Budapest). The depth of baseness to which the League of Nations can
      descend is shown by the fact that these 'civilized' brigands entered into
      a Butchers' League in partnership with General Yudenich, who was chief of
      the socalled North-Western Administration. The League of Nations incites
      Finland, Poland, etc., to attack Soviet Russia; with the aid of the
      consuls of the foreign Powers it organizes conspiracies; its agents blow
      up bridges, throw bombs at the communists, and so on. There is no atrocity
      of which the League of Nations is not capable.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The more vigorous the proletarian onslaught, the more firmly do the
      capitalists close their ranks. In the Communist Manifesto, penned in the
      year 1847, Marx and Engels wrote: 'A spectre haunts Europe, the spectre of
      communism. All the powers of old Europe have united in a holy alliance to
      lay this spectre - the pope and the tsar, Metternich and Guizot, the
      French radicals and the German police.' Many years have passed since then.
      The spectre of communism has begun to clothe itself in flesh and blood. In
      the campaign against it are arrayed, not only `old Europe', but the entire
      capitalist world. Nevertheless the League of Nations will be unable to
      fulfil its two aims, which are the organization of the world economy into
      a single trust and the universal suppression of the revolution. There is
      not sufficient unity even among the Great Powers. The United States is
      hostile to Japan, and both these Powers are arming for the fight. It is
      hardly credible that there can be much friendly feeling between defeated
      Germany and the `disinterested' robber Entente. Here is certainly a rift
      in the lute. The lesser States are fighting one with another. Still more
      important is the occurrence of a number of colonial risings and wars - in
      India, Egypt, Ireland, etc. Enslaved countries are beginning to fight
      against their `civilized' European slave- drivers. To the civil war, the
      class war waged by the proletariat against the imperialist bourgeoisie,
      there are superadded colonial risings which help to undermine and destroy
      the dominion of world-wide imperialism. Thus the imperialist system is
      being broken up by two different groups of influences. On the one hand, we
      have the upward movement of the proletariat, the wars waged by the
      proletarian republics, and the revolts and the wars carried on by the
      nations enslaved to the imperialists. On the other hand, we have the
      oppositions and disharmonies among the great capitalist Powers. Instead of
      `lasting peace', there is complete chaos; instead of universal repression
      of the proletariat, there is fierce civil war. In this civil war the
      strength of the proletariat waxes while the strength of the bourgeoisie
      wanes. The inevitable issue of the struggle will be the victory of the
      proletariat.</P>
    
    <P>Certainly the victory of the proletarian dictatorship will not be
      achieved on easy terms. The civil war, like any other war, demands the
      sacrifice of persons and the sacrifice of material values. Every
      revolution involves such costs. A natural consequence is that in the
      opening phases of this civil war the devastation due to the imperialist
      war is in various places considerably increased. It is obvious that when
      the best workmen, instead of working or organizing production, go to the
      front rifle in hand to defend themselves against the landlords and the
      military caste, the life of the factories must suffer. Plainly, the
      disorganization that results from the civil war is harmful. Manifestly,
      the loss of comrades that ensues is a costly sacrifice. But this is
      inevitable in every revolution. During the bourgeois revolution in France,
      in the years 1789-93, when the bourgeoisie was breaking the yoke of the
      landlords, the civil war brought much disorganization in its train. When,
      however, the caste of landlords and aristocrats had been conquered, the
      development of France was rapid and extensive.</P>
    
    <P>No one can fail to understand that in so gigantic a revolution as the
      universal revolution of the proletariat, which effects the overthrow of a
      system of oppression that required centuries to upbuild, the cost must be
      exceedingly great. We have seen that the civil war is now conducted upon a
      world-wide scale. In part it takes the form of a war waged by bourgeois
      States against proletarian States. The proletarian States which are
      defending themselves against the imperialist robbers, are waging the class
      war, which is in actual fact a holy war. But this war demands the
      sacrifice of blood. The wider the extent of the war, the larger will be
      the number of victims, and the more extensive will be the disorganization.</P>
    
    <P>But because revolution is costly, we must not for that reason set our
      faces against revolution. The capitalist system, the growth of centuries,
      culminated in the monstrous imperialist war, in which rivers of blood were
      shed. What civil war can compare in its destructive effects with the
      brutal disorganization and devastation, with the loss of the accumulated
      wealth of mankind, that resulted from the imperialist war? MANIFESTLY IT
      IS ESSENTIAL THAT HUMANITY SHALL MAKE AN END OF CAPITALISM ONCE AND FOR
      ALL. WITH THIS GOAL IN VIEW, WE CAN ENDURE THE PERIOD OF CIVIL WARS, AND
      CAN PAVE THE WAY FOR COMMUNISM, WHICH WILL HEAL ALL OUR WOUNDS, AND WILL
      QUICKLY LEAD TO THE FULL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRODUCTIVE FORCES OF HUMAN
      SOCIETY.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="034"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 34 Chaos or communism</H4>
    
    <P>The revolution as it develops becomes a world revolution for the same
      reason that the imperialist war became a world war. All important
      countries are interconnected, they are all parts of the world economy,
      nearly all of them were involved in the war, and were united by the war in
      a common understanding. In all countries alike, the war produced terrible
      devastation, led to famine, and to the enslavement of the proletariat.
      Everywhere it promoted the gradual decomposition and decay of capitalism,
      and ultimately caused a revolt against the savage discipline in the army,
      the factory, and the workshop. With the like inevitability it led to the
      communist revolution of the proletariat.</P>
    
    <P>Once they had begun, the disintegration of capitalism and the growth of
      the communist revolution could no longer be stayed. The ruin of capitalism
      was imminent. Every attempt to establish a truly human society upon the
      old capitalist foundations is foredoomed to absolute failure. The class
      consciousness of the proletarian masses is now so fully developed, that
      they neither can nor will work for capital. They refuse to slay one
      another in the interests of capital, of colonial policy, etc. The army of
      William I I cannot possibly be re-established in Germany today. And just
      as it is impossible to re-establish an imperialist discipline in the army,
      just as it has become impossible to compel proletarian soldiers to subject
      themselves to the yoke of junker generals, so is it impossible to
      re-establish the capitalist discipline of labour, and to compel the
      workers to toil for a master or the peasants to toil for a landlord. The
      new army can only be created by the proletariat; the new labour discipline
      can only be created by the working class.</P>
    
    <P>We are thus confronted by two alternatives, and two only. There must
      either be complete disintegration, hell broth, further brutalization and
      disorder, <I>absolute chaos</I>, <I>or else communism</I>. All attempts
      that have been made to re-establish capitalism in a country where for a
      time the masses have had power in their own hands, confirm this statement
      of alternatives. Neither the Finnish bourgeoisie nor the Hungarian
      bourgeoisie, neither Kolchak nor Denikin nor Skoropadsky, was in a
      position to restore economic life. They were unable to establish even
      their own bloody system upon a firm footing.</P>
    
    <P>THE ONLY ISSUE FOR HUMANITY IS COMMUNISM. AND SINCE COMMUNISM CAN BE
      REALIZED ONLY BY THE PROLETARIAT, THE PROLETARIAT IS TODAY THE TRUE
      SAVIOUR OF MANKIND FROM THE HORRORS OF CAPITALISM, FROM THE BARBARITIES OF
      EXPLOITATION, FROM COLONIAL POLICY, INCESSANT WARS, FAMINE, A LAPSE .INTO
      SAVAGERY AND BRUTALIZATION, FROM ALL THE ABOMINATIONS THAT ARE ENTAILED BY
      FINANCIAL CAPITAL AND IMPERIALISM. HEREIN LIES THE SPLENDID HISTORIC
      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROLETARIAT. THE WORKERS MAY SUFFER DEFEAT IN
      INDIVIDUAL BATTLES, AND EVEN IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES. BUT THE VICTORY OF
      THE PROLETARIAT IS NO LESS CERTAIN THAN THE RUIN OF THE BOURGEOISIE IS
      INEVITABLE.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">From the foregoing it is plain that all groups,
      classes, and parties which believe the re-establishment of capitalism to
      be possible, which imagine that the time is not yet ripe for the coming of
      socialism, are in fact, whether they wish it or not and whether they know
      it or not, playing the part of counter-revolutionaries and reactionaries.
      Of this character are all the parties that preach class collaboration. We
      shall return to the matter in the next chapter.</FONT></P>

      The word 'monopoly' is derived from two Greek words, <I>monos </I>(alone,
      sole, single) and <I>polein</I> (to sell). In Russia at one time, the use
      of the term 'monopoly' was almost restricted to denoting the governmental
      monopoly in spirituous liquors. But there can exist a monopoly in any
      commodity; and a monopoly may be held by a manufacturer or a group of
      manufacturers just as well as by the State.</P>
