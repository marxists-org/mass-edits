    <H4>§ 35 Internationalsm of the workers' movement essential to the
    victory of the communist revolution</H4>
    
    <P>The communist revolution can be victorious only as a world revolution.
      If a state of affairs arose in which one country was ruled by the working
      class, while in other countries the working class, not from fear but from
      conviction, remained submissive to capital, in the end the great robber
      States would crush the workers' State of the first country. During the
      years 1917-18-19 all the Powers were trying to crush Soviet Russia; in
      1919 they crushed Soviet Hungary. They were, however, unable to crush
      Soviet Russia, for the internal conditions in their own countries were
      critical, and the governments were all afraid of being overthrown by their
      own workers, who demanded the withdrawal of the invading armies from
      Russia. The significance of this is, in the first place, that the
      realization of proletarian dictatorship in one country is gravely
      imperilled unless active assistance is given by the workers of other
      lands. It signifies, in the second place, that, under such conditions,
      when the workers have gained the victory in only one country, the
      organization of economic life in that country is a very difficult matter.
      Such a country receives little or nothing from abroad; it is blockaded on
      all sides.</P>
    
    <P>If, however, for the victory of communism, it is essential that there
      should be a world revolution and that the workers in various lands should
      render mutual aid one to another, this implies that the international
      solidarity of the working class is an essential preliminary to victory.
      The conditions for the general struggle of the workers are like the
      conditions for the working class struggle in each individual country. In
      any one country the workers cannot win strikes when these are isolated
      affairs; they can only win strikes when the workers in separate factories
      combine for mutual support, when they found a joint organization, and when
      they conduct a united campaign against all the factory owners. It is just
      the same for the workers living in the various bourgeois States. They can
      only gain the victory when they march shoulder to shoulder, when they do
      not quarrel among themselves, when the proletarians of all lands unite,
      feeling themselves to be a single class with interests common to them all.
      Complete mutual trust, a brotherly alliance, united revolutionary action
      against world capitalism - these alone can bring victory to the working
      class. THE WORKERS' COMMUNIST MOVEMENT CAN CONQUER ONLY AS AN
      INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST MOVEMENT.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The need for an international struggle on the part of
      the proletariat has long been recognized. In the forties of the last
      century, on the eve of the revolution of 1848, there already existed an
      international secret organization known as the Communist Federation. Marx
      and Engels were its leaders. At the London conference of the organization
      they were instructed to write a manifesto in its name. Such was the origin
      of the Manifesto of the Communist Party, in which the great champions of
      the proletariat gave the first exposition of communist teaching.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In 1864 there was constituted under Marx's leadership
      the International Working Men's Association, now commonly spoken of as the
      <I>First International</I>. In the First International there were
      associated a number of working class leaders from various countries, but
      unity was lacking. Moreover, the organization was not yet based upon the
      broad masses of the workers, but rather took the form of an international
      society of revolutionary pro- pagandists. In 1871 the members of the
      International took part in the rising of the Parisian workers (the Commune
      of Paris). There ensued everywhere a persecution of the branches of the
      International. It collapsed in 18'74, having been greatly weakened by
      internal dissensions, by the struggles between the adherents of Marx and
      those of the anarchist, Bakunin. After the break-up of the First
      International, the growth of socialist parties began in various countries.
      The more rapid the development of industry, the more rapid was the growth
      of these parties. The need for mutual support was felt so strongly, that
      in 1889 there was held an international socialist congress attended by
      delegates of the socialist parties of numerous countries. Thus the <I>Second
      International</I> came into being. The Second International remained in
      existence till 1914, when the war gave it its death blow. The causes of
      its failure will be discussed in the next section.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the Communist Manifesto, Marx already sounded the
      war cry: 'Proletarians of all lands, unite!' Here are the concluding lines
      of the manifesto: 'The communists disdain to conceal their views and aims.
      They openly declare that their ends can only be attained by the forcible
      overthrow of the existing social order. Let the ruling classes tremble at
      a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their
      chains. They have a world to win. Proletarians of all lands, unite!'</FONT></P>
    
    <P>It thus appears that the international solidarity of the proletariat is
      not a toy or a fine phrase, but a vital necessity, without which the
      working class movement would be foredoomed to failure.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="036"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 36 The collapse of the Second International and its causes</H4>
    
    <P>When the great world war began in August, 1914, the socialist and
      social-democratic parties of the various belligerent lands (with the
      exception of Russia, Serbia, and at a later date Italy), instead of
      declaring war upon the war and instead of inciting the workers to revolt,
      rallied to the side of their respective governments, and gave their
      assistance to the campaign for plunder. On one and the same day, the
      socialist deputies in France and Germany voted the war credits in
      parliament, thus solidarizing themselves with the robber governments.
      Instead of joining forces in a rising against the criminal bourgeoisie,
      the socialist parties took up separate stands, each under the banner of
      its 'own' bourgeois government. The war began with the direct support of
      the socialist parties; the leaders of these parties turned their coats and
      betrayed the cause of socialism. The Second International died an
      ignominious death.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is interesting to note that, only a few days before
      the betrayal, the socialist press and the leaders of the socialist parties
      were holding forth against the war. Gustave Hervé, for example, the
      traitor to French socialism, wrote as follows in his newspaper 'La Guerre
      Sociale' [The Class War, subsequently rechristened Victory]: ' We are to
      fight in order to save the tsar's prestige!...How delightful to die in so
      glorious a cause!' Three days before the outbreak of war, the French
      Socialist Party issued a manifesto against it, and the French syndicalists
      wrote in their journal, 'Workers! If you are not cowards, protest!' The
      German social democrats held numerous great meetings of protest. The
      memory of the resolution passed at the Basle international congress was
      still fresh, a resolution to the effect that in case of war all possible
      means must be employed 'to incite the people to revolt and to hasten the
      collapse of capitalism'. But within a day or two these same parties and
      these same leaders were insisting upon the need for 'the defence of the
      fatherland' (this meaning the defence of the robber State of their 'own'
      bourgeoisie). In Austria the 'Arbeiter Zeitung' [Worker's Gazette]
      actually declared that the workers must rally to the defence of 'German
      humanity'</FONT></P>
    
    <P>In order to understand the inglorious collapse of the Second
      International, we must study the development of the working class movement
      prior to the war. Before this conflict, capitalism in Europe and the USA
      had largely owed its development to the frantic plunder of the colonies.
      The loathsome and sanguinary aspects of capitalism were here displayed
      with exceptional clearness. By brutal exploitation, by robbery, fraud, and
      force, values were extracted from the colonial nations, and were
      transmuted into profit for the sharks of European and American financial
      capital. The stronger the position of any State capitalist trust in the
      world market, the larger were the profits it could derive from the
      exploitation of the colonies. Out of these surplus profits the trust could
      afford to pay its wage slaves a trifle more than the ordinary wages of
      labour. Not of course to all the wage workers, but only to those who are
      usually spoken of as skilled workers. These strata of the working class
      are thereby won over to the side of capital. Their reasoning runs as
      follows: 'If &quot;our&quot; industry finds a market in the African
      colonies, so much the better; it will flourish all the more; the boss will
      make larger' profits, and we shall have a finger in the pie.' Thus capital
      fetters its wage slaves to its own State, buying one section of them, who
      are attracted by a share in the colonial plunder.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The founders of scientific communism had already taken
      note of this phenomenon. Engels, for example in a letter to Kautsky, wrote
      in the year 1882: You ask me what the British workers think about colonial
      policy. Very much the same as what they think about politics in general.
      Here there does not yet exist a labour party; there are only conservatives
      and liberal radicals; while the workers gladly participate in those
      advantages which accrue to the British in virtue of their monopoly on the
      world market and in the colonies.' Upon this soil has flourished a
      peculiar form of servility, an attachment of the workers to the
      bourgeoisie of their own country, an abasement before them. Engels wrote
      in 1889: 'The most repulsive phenomenon here in England is the bourgeois
      respectability which soaks into the very marrow of the workers . . . . So
      deeply rooted is this inborn respect for &quot;betters&quot; and &quot;superiors&quot;
      that Mr Bourgeois finds it an easy matter to catch the workers in his
      nets. I really believe that, at the bottom of his heart, John Burns is
      more flattered by his popularity with Cardinal Manning and other notables,
      with the bourgeoisie generally, than by his popularity with his own
      class.'</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The working masses were not accustomed to carry on a great fight upon
      the international scale. Indeed, they had no opportunity for anything of
      the sort. For the most part the activity of their organizations was
      confined within the limits of the State administered by their own
      bourgeoisie. 'Their own' bourgeoisie managed to interest in colonial
      policy a section of the working class, and chiefly the stratum of skilled
      workers. The same bait was swallowed by the leaders of the working class
      organizations, by the working class bureaucracy, and by the parliamentary
      representatives of the workers, these being all persons who had secured
      cosy corners, and were inclined to advocate 'peaceful', 'quiet', and
      'law-abiding' methods. We have already pointed out that the bloodthirsty
      aspects of capitalism were especially displayed in the colonies. In Europe
      and the United States, industry was highly developed, and in these regions
      the struggle of the working class had assumed comparatively peaceful
      forms. Since 1871 there had been no great revolutions anywhere except in
      Russia, and in most countries there had been none since 1848. People were
      universally accustomed to the idea that the future development of
      capitalism would be peaceful, and even those who spoke of coming wars
      hardly believed their own words. A section of the workers, including the
      working class leaders, was more and more inclined to accept the idea that
      the working class was interested in colonial policy and that the workers
      ought to join forces with their own bourgeoisie in order to promote, in
      this matter, 'the common national welfare'. Consequently, large numbers of
      the lower middle class flocked into the socialist parties. In Germany, for
      example, among the members of the social-democratic parliamentary group,
      there was quite a number of publicans and keepers of working class
      restaurants. In 1892, out of 35 socialist MPs, there were 4 following
      these occupations; in 1905, there were 6 out of 81; in 1912, there were 12
      out of 110.</P>
    
    <P>It is not surprising that in critical moments their devotion to the
      imperialist robber State outweighed their devotion to international
      solidarity.</P>
    
    <P>WE SEE, THEN, THAT THE CHIEF CAUSE OF THE BREAK-UP OF THE SECOND
      INTERNATIONAL WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE FACT THAT THE COLONIAL POLICY AND THE
      MONOPOLIST POSITION OF THE GREAT STATE CAPITALIST TRUSTS, HAD ATTACHED THE
      WORKERS AND ESPECIALLY THE ' UPPER STRATA' OF THE WORKING CLASS - TO THE
      IMPERIALIST BOURGEOIS STATE.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the history of the working class movement it has
      often happened that the workers have made common cause with their
      oppressors. For example, in the very early stages of development, the
      worker who sat at the same table with his master, looked upon his master's
      workshop almost as if it had been his own, and regarded his master not as
      an enemy but as a 'giver of work'. Only in course of time did the workers
      in various factories come to unite one with another against all the
      masters. When the great countries had themselves been converted into
      'State capitalist trusts', the workers continued to display towards these
      State capitalist trusts the same sort of devotion that in earlier days
      they had displayed towards individual masters.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Only the war has taught them that they must not take
      the side of their respective bourgeois States, but must join forces for
      the overthrow of these bourgeois States and for the realization of the
      dictatorship of the proletariat.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><A NAME="037"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 37 The watchwords &quot;National Defence&quot; and &quot;Pacifism&quot;</H4>
    
    <P>The leaders of the socialist parties and of the Second International
      justified their treason to the cause of the workers and to the common
      struggle of the working class by saying that it was essential to defend
      the fatherland.</P>
    
    <P>We have seen that as far as the imperialist war was concerned this was
      pure nonsense. In that war not one of the Great Powers was on the
      defensive; all were aggressors. The slogan 'defence of the fatherland'
      (the defence of the bourgeois State) was humbug, and was shouted by the
      leaders in order to hide their treason.</P>
    
    <P>Here it is necessary to consider the question in somewhat greater
      detail.</P>
    
    <P>First of all, what is our fatherland? What is the real meaning of this
      word? Does it mean, people who all speak the same language; is it the same
      as 'nation'? No, it is not. Let us consider, for example, tsarist Russia.
      When the Russian bourgeoisie clamoured for the defence of the fatherland,
      it was not thinking of the area in which people of one nationality were
      living, of the area, say, inhabited by the White Russians; it was
      referring to the peoples of various nationalities who are settled in
      Russia. What, in fact, did the bourgeoisie mean? Nothing else than the
      State authority of the Russian bourgeoisie and the landlords. This is what
      the capitalists wanted the Russian workers to defend. Really, of course,
      they were not thinking simply of defending it, but of extending its
      frontiers to include Constantinople and Cracow. When the German
      bourgeoisie sang the defence of the fatherland, what was the meaning in
      that case? Here the reference was to the authority of the German
      bourgeoisie, to an extension of the boundaries of the robber State ruled
      by William II. </P>
    
    <P>We have then to inquire whether, under capitalism, the working class has
      any fatherland at all. Marx, in The Manifesto of the Communist Party,
      replied to this question by saying: 'The workers have no country.' What he
      said was true. Why? The answer is very simple. Because under capitalism
      the workers have no power; because under capitalism everything is in the
      hands of the bourgeoisie; because under capitalism the State is merely an
      instrument for the suppression and oppression of the working class. We
      have already seen that the task of the proletariat is to destroy the
      bourgeois State, not to defend it. Then only will the proletariat have a
      country, when it has seized the State authority and has become master of
      the country. Then, and only then, will it be the duty of the proletariat
      to defend its fatherland; for then it will be defending its own authority
      and its own cause; it will not be defending the authority of its enemies,
      and will not be defending the robber policy of its oppressors.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The bourgeoisie is well aware of all this. Here is
      evidence of the fact. When the proletariat had effected the conquest of
      power in Russia, the Russian bourgeoisie began to fight against Russia,
      forming an alliance with anyone who was willing - with the Germans, the
      Japanese, the British, the Americans, with all the world and his wife.
      Why? Because, having lost power in Russia, it had also lost the power of
      robbing and plundering, the power of bourgeois exploitation. The Russian
      capitalists were ready at any moment to destroy <I>proletarian</I>
      Russia, to destroy, that is the Soviet Power. Let us take Hungary for
      another example. When the bourgeois had the power in their own hands they
      issued appeals for the defence of the fatherland; but in order to destroy
      proletarian Hungary they were prompt to enter into an alliance with the
      Rumanians, the Czecho-Slovaks, the Austrians, and the Entente. We see,
      then, that the bourgeoisie knows perfectly well what it is about. Under
      the plea of the defence of the fatherland, it appeals to all citizens to
      defend its own bourgeois power, and it sentences for high treason all who
      refuse to assist. On the other hand, when it is a question of destroying
      the proletarian fatherland, it assembles all its forces and sticks at
      nothing.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The proletariat must take a leaf out of the bourgeois
      book; it must destroy the <I>bourgeois</I> fatherland and must do nothing
      for its defence or enlargement; but the proletariat must defend its own
      fatherland with all its might and to the last drop of its blood.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>To these considerations the objector may reply as follows. Do you not
      know, he will say, that colonial policy and imperialism have helped the
      industrial development of the Great Powers, and that, thanks to this,
      crumbs from the masters' table fall to the working class? Surely this
      means that the worker should defend his master, should help his master
      against competitors?</P>
    
    <P>It means nothing of the kind. Let us suppose that there are two
      manufacturers whom we will call Schultz and Petrov. They are rivals in the
      market. Schultz says to his men: 'Friends, stand by me with all your
      strength. Do all the harm you can to the Petrov factory, to Petrov
      himself, to his workmen. Then my factory will flourish, for I shall have
      downed Petrov and my business will boom. I shall be able to give all you
      fellows a rise.' Petrov says just the same to his men. Now let us suppose
      that Schultz has the best of it. It is quite likely that in the flush of
      victory he will give his workers a rise. But after a time he will cut down
      wages to the old level. If now the workers in the Schultz factory go on
      strike, and would like those who had formerly worked in the Petrov factory
      to help them, the latter would say: 'Mighty fine! You did us all the harm
      you could, and now you come crawling to us for help! Clear out!' It would
      be impossible to arrange for a general strike. When the workers are
      disunited, the capitalist is strong. Now that he has overthrown his
      competitor, he is able to get the better of his disunited workers. For a
      brief space the workers in Schultz's factory enjoyed higher wages, but
      their gains were soon lost. Just the same thing happens in the
      international struggle. The bourgeois State is a masters' league. When one
      such league grows fat at the expense of the others, it is able to bribe
      the workers. The collapse of the Second International and the betrayal of
      socialism by the leaders of the working class movement occurred because
      these leaders determined to 'defend' the crumbs that fell from the
      masters' table and hoped for an increase in the amount of these crumbs.
      During the war, when, owing to the aforesaid treason, the workers were
      disunited, capital in all countries imposed terrible burdens upon them.
      The workers came to realize their miscalculation; they came to understand
      that their leaders had sold them for the merest trifle. Thus began the
      rebirth of socialism. We can readily understand that the first protests
      came from the badly paid, unskilled workers. The 'aristocracy of labour'
      (the printers, for instance) and the old leaders, continued to play a
      traitor's game.</P>
    
    <P>Not content with using the slogan of the defence of the (bourgeois)
      fatherland, the bourgeoisie has another means with which to cheat and
      befool the working masses. We refer to the so-called <I>pacifism</I>.
      This name is given to the view that within the framework of capitalism -
      without any revolution, without any revolt of the workers - a reign of
      universal peace can be established. It would suffice, we are told, to set
      up courts of arbitration between the various Powers, to abolish secret
      diplomacy, to agree upon disarmament (at first, perhaps, only to a limited
      extent). With this and a few similar measures, all would be well.</P>
    
    <P>The basic error of pacifism is that the bourgeoisie simply will not
      carry out any of these fine things like disarmament. It is absolutely
      absurd to preach disarmament in an era of imperialism and civil war. The
      bourgeoisie will take care to be well armed; and if the workers were to
      disarm or were to fail to arm themselves, they would be inviting
      destruction. We can thus realize how the pacifist watchwords cannot fail
      to lead the proletariat astray. PACIFISM TENDS TO PREVENT THE WORKERS FROM
      CONCENTRATING THEIR ATTENTION UPON THE ARMED STRUGGLE FOR COMMUNISM.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The best example of the fraudulent character of
      pacifism is furnished by the policy of Wilson, and by his fourteen points.
      Here, under a garnish of fine words, and in the name of the League of
      Nations, world-wide plunder and a civil war against the proletariat are
      promulgated. The following examples will show to what depths of baseness
      the pacifists can descend. Taft, sometime president of the USA, was one of
      the founders of the American Peace Society, and at the same time a rabid
      imperialist. Ford, the famous American motor-car manufacturer, financed
      entire expeditions to Europe in order to trumpet his pacifist views; but
      at the very same time he was netting millions of dollars from the work his
      factories were doing for the war. Fried, in his Handbook of the Peace
      Movement (<I>Handbuch der Friedensbewegung</I>, vol. ii, pp. 149-50)
      assures his readers that the joint expedition of the imperialists against
      China in 1900 proved the 'brotherhood of the nations'. He writes as
      follows: 'The expedition to China furnished another proof of the
      ascendancy of the idea of peace in contemporary affairs. An <I>international
      association of armies</I> was displayed . . . . The armies marched, as a
      pacific force, under the command of a European generalissimo. We, the
      friends of peace, regard this world generalissimo' [he was writing about
      Count Waldersee, who was appointed generalissimo by William II] 'as merely
      the forerunner of that world statesman who will be in a position to
      realize our ideal of peaceful methods.' Here we see open and universal
      robbery designated 'the brotherhood of the nations'. In like manner, the
      robber League of Capitalists is dished up with the League of Nations'
      sauce.</FONT></P>

    <H4>§ 38 Jingo socialists</H4>
    
    <P>The false watchwords with which, day after day, the bourgeoisie deafened
      the masses, with which the newspapers were filled, and which clamoured
      from every hoarding, were also adopted as slogans by the traitors to
      socialism.</P>
    
    <P>In nearly all countries, the old socialist parties were split up. Three
      trends were manifest. First of all, there were open and brazen-faced
      traitors, the jingo socialists. Secondly, there were secret and
      vacillating traitors, constituting the so-called centre. Thirdly, there
      were those who remained faithful to socialism. Out of the members of this
      third group, the communist parties were subsequently organized.</P>
    
    <P>In nearly every country the leaders of the old socialist parties proved
      to be jingo socialists. Under the banner of socialism, they preached
      international hatred; under the lying watchword of the defence of the
      fatherland, they preached the support of the robber bourgeois States.
      Among the jingo socialists in Germany were Scheidemann, Noske, Ebert,
      David, Heine, and others; in England, Henderson; in the U S A, Russell,
      Gompers; in France, Renaudel, Albert-Thomas, Guesde, Jouhaux; in Russia,
      Plekhanov, Potresov, the right essers (Breshko-Breshkovskaya, Kerensky,
      Chernov), and the right mensheviks (Liber, Rosanov); in Austria, Renner,
      Seitz, Victor Adler; in Hungary, Garami, Buchinger, etc.</P>
    
    <P>One and all they were for the 'defence' of the bourgeois fatherland.
      Many of them openly declared themselves in favour of the robber policy of
      annexations and indemnities, and advocated the seizure of the colonial
      possessions of other nations. These were usually spoken of as the
      imperialist socialists. Throughout the war, they supported it, not only by
      voting the war credits, but by propaganda. In Russia, Plekhanov's
      manifesto was widely posted on the hoardings by Hvostov, the tsarist
      minister of State. General Kornilov made Plekhanov a member of his
      administration. Kerensky (the social revolutionary) and Tseretelli (the
      menshevik), concealed the tsar's secret treaties from the people; in the
      July days, they bludgeoned the Petrograd proletariat; the social
      revolutionaries and the right mensheviks were members of Kolchak's
      administration; Rosanov was one of Yudenich's spies. In a word, like all
      the bourgeoisie, they stood for the support of the robber bourgeois
      fatherland, and for the destruction of the proletarian soviet fatherland.
      The French jingo socialists, Guesde and AlbertThomas, entered the robber
      government; they supported all the predatory plans of the Entente; they
      stood for the suppression of the Russian revolution and for the sending of
      troops against the Russian workers. The German jingo socialists entered
      the ministry while William I I was still on the throne (Scheidemann); they
      supported the emperor when he suppressed the Finnish revolution and when
      he ravaged Ukraine and Great Russia; members of the Social-Democratic
      Party (for instance, Winnig in Riga) conducted campaigns against the
      Russian and the Latvian workers; subsequently, the German jingo socialists
      murdered Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, and drowned in blood the
      risings of the communist workers of Berlin, Leipzig, Hamburg, Munich, etc.
      The Hungarian jingo socialists gave their support to the monarchical
      government as long as that was in power; afterwards they betrayed the
      Soviet Republic. IN A WORD, IN ALL COUNTRIES ALIKE, THE JINGO SOCIALISTS
      ASSUMED THE ROLE OF EXECUTIONERS AGAINST THE WORKING CLASS.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">When Plekhanov was still a revolutionist, writing in
      the Russian newspaper 'Iskra' (published in Switzerland) he declared that
      in the twentieth century, which was destined to witness the realization of
      socialism, there would in all probability be a great split in the
      socialist ranks, and that a fierce struggle would ensue between the two
      factions. Just as, in the days of the French revolution 1789-93), the
      extremist revolutionary party (nicknamed the Mountain) carried on a civil
      war against the moderates who were later organized as a
      counter-revolutionary party (spoken of as the Gironde) so- said Plekhanov
      - in the twentieth century, those who had at one time been brothers in
      opinion would probably be split into two warring sections, for some of
      them would have taken sides with the bourgeoisie.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Plekhanov's prophecy was fulfilled. But when he wrote
      he did not foresee that he himself would be among the traitors.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>In this way the jingo socialists (sometimes spoken of as opportunists)
      are transformed into the open class enemies of the proletariat. During the
      great world revolution they fight in the ranks of the Whites against the
      Reds; they march shoulder to shoulder with the military caste, with the
      great bourgeoisie and with the landlords. It is perfectly clear that we
      must wage as relentless a war against them as against the bourgeoisie,
      whose agents they are.</P>
    
    <P>The remnants of the Second International, which the members of these
      parties have endeavoured to revive, form merely a branch office of the
      League of Nations. THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL IS NOW ONE OF THE WEAPONS USED
      BY THE BOURGEOISIE IN ITS FIGHT WITH THE PROLETARIAT.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="039"></A></P>
    
    <H4>§ 39 The Centre</H4>
    
    <P>Another group of parties composed of those who were once socialists
      constitutes the so-called 'Centre'. Persons of this trend are said to form
      the 'Centre' because they waver between the communists on one side and the
      jingo socialists on the other. Of this complexion are: in Russia, the left
      mensheviks under the leadership of Martov ; in Germany, the '
      independents' (the Independent Social Democratic Party), under the
      leadership of Kautsky and Haase; in France, the group led by Jean Longuet;
      in the USA, the Socialist Party of America, under the leadership of
      Hilquit; in Great Britain, part of the British Socialist Party, the
      Independent Labour Party; and so on.</P>
    
    <P>At the outset of the war the centrists advocated the defence of the
      fatherland (making common cause in this matter with the traitors to
      socialism), and they opposed the idea of revolution. Kautsky wrote that
      the 'enemy invasion' was the most terrible thing in the world, and that
      the class struggle must be postponed until everything was over. In
      Kautsky's opinion, as long as the war lasted, there was nothing whatever
      for the International to do. After the conclusion of 'peace', Kautsky
      began to write that everything was now in a state of such great confusion
      that it was no use dreaming about socialism. The reasoning amounts to
      this. While the war was on, we must drop the class struggle, for it would
      be useless, and we must wait until after the war; when peace has come,
      there is no use thinking about the class war, for the imperialist war has
      entailed general exhaustion. It is plain that Kautsky's theory is an
      avowal of absolute impotence, that it is calculated to lead the
      proletariat utterly astray, and that it is closely akin to rank treason.
      Worse still, when we were in the very throes of revolution, Kautsky could
      find nothing better to do than to raise the hunt against the bolsheviks.
      Forgetting Marx's teaching, he persisted in a campaign against the
      proletarian dictatorship, the Terror, etc., ignoring the fact that in this
      way he was himself assisting the White Terror of the bourgeoisie. His own
      hopes would appear to be now those of the ordinary pacifist; he wants
      courts of arbitration, and things of that sort. Thus he has come to
      resemble any bourgeois pacifist you care to name.</P>
    
    <P>Although Kautsky's position is to the right of the Centre, we choose him
      as an example rather than another because his theory is typical of the
      centrist outlook.</P>
    
    <P>The chief characteristic of centrist policy is the way in which it
      wobbles between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The Centre is
      unsteady on its legs; wants to reconcile irreconcilables; and at the
      critical moment betrays the proletariat. During the Russian November
      Revolution, the Russian Centre (Martov &amp; Co.) vociferated against the
      use of force by the bolsheviks; it endeavoured to 'reconcile' everybody,
      thus actually helping the White Guards, and reducing the energy of the
      proletariat in the hour of struggle. The mensheviks did not even exclude
      from their party those who had acted as spies and plotters for the
      military caste. In the crisis of the proletarian struggle, the Centre
      advocated a strike in the name of the Constituent Assembly against the
      dictatorship of the proletariat. During Kolchak's onslaught, some of these
      mensheviks, solidarizing themselves with the bourgeois plotters, raised
      the slogan, 'Stop the civil war' (the menshevik Pleskov). In Germany the
      'independents' played a treacherous part at the time of the rising of the
      Berlin workers, for they practised their policy of 'concilation' while the
      fight was actually in progress, and thus contributed to the defeat. Among
      the independents there are many advocates of collaboration with the
      Seheidemannites. But the gravest charge against them is that they refrain
      from the advocacy of a mass rising against the bourgeoisie, and that they
      wish to drug the proletariat with pacifist hopes. In France and Britain,
      the Centre 'condemns' the counter-revolution; it 'protests' in words
      against the crushing of the revolution; but it displays utter incapacity
      for mass action.</P>
    
    <P>At the present time the centrist group does quite as much harm as do the
      jingo socialists. The centrists, sometimes spoken of as the Kautskyites,
      are attempting, like the jingo socialists, to reanimate the corpse of the
      Second International and to 'reconcile' it with the communists.
      Unquestionably, a victory over the counter- revolution is impossible
      without a definite breach, and without a decisive struggle against them.</P>
    
    <P>The attempts to revive the Second International took place under the
      benevolent patronage of the robber League of Nations. For, in fact, the
      jingo socialists are faithful supporters of the decaying capitalist order,
      and are its very last props. The imperialist war could never have
      continued to rage for five years but for the treachery of the socialist
      parties. Directly the period of revolution began, the bourgeoisie looked
      to the socialist traitors for help in crushing the proletarian movement.
      The sometime socialist parties were the chief obstacle in the way of the
      struggle of the working class for the overthrow of capitalism. Throughout
      the war, every one of the traitor socialist parties echoed all that the
      bourgeoisie said. After the peace of Versailles, when the League of
      Nations was founded, the remnants of the Second International (the Centre
      as well as the jingo socialists) began to re-echo all the slogans uttered
      by the League of Nations. The League accused the bolsheviks of terrorism,
      of violating democracy, of Red imperialism. The Second International
      repeated the accusations. Instead of engaging in a decisive struggle
      against the imperialists, it voiced the imperialist war-cries. Just as the
      various parties of socialist traitors had supported the respective
      bourgeois administrations, so did the Second International support the
      League of Nations.</P>

    <H4>§ 40 The Third International</H4>
    
    <P>The jingo socialists and the Centre adopted as their watchword during
      the war, the defence of the (bourgeois) fatherland, this meaning the
      defence of the State organization of the enemies of the proletariat. A
      logical sequel was the watchword of the 'party truce', which signified
      universal submission to the bourgeois State. The matter is perfectly
      clear. When Plekhanov or Scheide mann considered it necessary to 'defend'
      the tsarist or kaiserist fatherland, they had, of course, to insist that
      the workers must do absolutely nothing to interfere with the defence of
      the robber State. Consequently, there must be no strikes, and still less
      must there be any talk of rising against the bourgeoisie. The socialist
      traitors reasoned as follows. First of all, they said, we must settle
      accounts with the 'foreign' enemy, and then we shall see. For example,
      Plekhanov declared in his manifesto that there must be no strikes now that
      Russia was in danger. The workers of all the belligerent lands were
      enslaved by the bourgeoisie in like manner. But from the first days of the
      war there were groups of trusty socialists who realized that the 'defence
      of the fatherland' and the 'truce of parties' tied the proletariat hand
      and foot, and that to utter these slogans was treason to the workers. The
      bolsheviks saw this from the outset. As early as 1914 they declared that
      there must be no truce with the bourgeoisie, but unceasing struggle
      against the capitalists revolution. The first duty of the proletariat in
      any country is to overthrow its own bourgeoisie - such was the opinion
      voiced by our party in the early days of the war. In Germany, too, there
      was formed a group of comrades led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg.
      This group took the name of International, declaring that the
      international solidarity of the proletariat was the first of all duties.
      Soon Karl Liebknecht openly proclaimed the need for civil war, and incited
      the workers to armed insurrection against the bourgeoisie. Such was the
      origin of the party of the German bolsheviks - the Spartacist group. In
      the other countries, too, there was a split in the old parties. In Sweden
      there were bolsheviks, who formed what was known as the Left Socialist
      Party; while in Norway the 'lefts' gained entire control of the party. The
      Italian socialists took a firm stand throughout. In a word, there
      gradually came into existence the parties which stood for the revolution.
      An attempt to secure unified action was now made in Switzerland. In two
      conferences, at Zimmerwald and Kienthal respectively, were laid the
      foundations of the Third International. Soon, however, it became apparent
      that certain dubious elements from the Centre were adhering to the
      movement, and were in fact hindering it. Within the international union of
      Zimmerwald there was formed the so-called ' Zimmerwald Left' under the
      leadership of Comrade Lenin. The Zimmerwald Left was in favour of decisive
      action. It fiercely criticized the Zimmerwald Centre led by Kautsky.</P>
    
    <P>After the November revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Power
      in Russia, that country came to occupy the most important place in the
      international movement. In order to distinguish itself from the party of
      the traitors to socialism, and in order to return to the fine old fighting
      name, our party now called itself the Communist Party. Under the impulsion
      of the Russian revolution, communist parties were formed in other lands.
      The Spartacus League changed its name to the Communist Party of Germany. A
      communist party was formed in Hungary, headed by Bela Kun, who had at one
      time been a prisoner of war in Russia. Parties were also formed in
      Austria, Czecho-Slovakia, Finland, etc., and subsequently in France. In
      the United States, the centre expelled the left wing from the party, and
      the lefts thereupon organized themselves into a fighting communist party.
      In Britain, negotiations for the formation of a united communist party
      were begun in the autumn of 1919. To sum up, after the split between the
      Centre and the Left, the formation and active development of real
      revolutionary workers' parties began everywhere. The development of these
      parties led to the formation of a new International, the <I>Communist
      International</I>. In March, 1919, at the Kremlin in Moscow, was held the
      first international communist congress, at which the Third, or Communist,
      International was formally constituted. The congress was attended by
      delegates from the German, Russian, Austrian, Hungarian, Swedish,
      Norwegian, and Finnish communists; communists from France, the USA,
      Britain, etc., were also present.</P>
    
    <P>The platform put forward by the German and Russian communists was
      adopted by the congress with complete unanimity, this showing that the
      proletariat had planted its feet solidly under the banner of the
      dictatorship of the proletariat, soviet power, and communism.</P>
    
    <P>The Third International took the name of Communist International in
      conformity with that of the Communist Federation which had been headed by
      Karl Marx. In all its works the Third International shows that it is
      following in the footsteps of Marx, that it is on the revolutionary road
      towards the forcible overthrow of the capitalist system. It is not
      surprising that all who are live, trusty, and revolutionary minded members
      of the international proletariat are turning more and more eagerly towards
      the new International, and are joining forces to form the workers'
      vanguard.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The very name Communist International suffices to show
      that the organization has absolutely nothing in common with the traitors
      to socialism.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Marx and Engels consider the name 'social democrat'
      unsuitable for the party of the revolutionary proletariat. 'Democrat'
      signifies one who advocates a particular form of rule. But, as we have
      previously seen, in the society of the future there will be no 'State' of
      any kind. During the transitional period there will have to be a
      dictatorship of the workers. Those who have betrayed the working class
      look no farther than a bourgeois republic. We are out for communism.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the preface to the 1888 edition of the Communist
      Manifesto, Engels wrote that the name socialist had in 1847, when the
      manifesto was penned, signified 'men outside the working class movement,
      and looking rather to the &quot;educated&quot; classes for support'; but
      communism in 1847 was a working class movement. We see the same thing
      today. The communists look for support to the rank and file of the
      workers; the social democrats look for support to the aristocracy of the
      workers, to the professional classes, to the small shopkeepers, and to the
      petty bourgeoisie in general.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL HAS THUS REALIZED MARX'S DOCTRINES IN ACTUAL
      FACT, FOR IT HAS FREED THEM FROM THE ACCRETIONS WHICH HAD FORMED UPON THEM
      DURING THE 'PEACEFUL' PERIOD OF CAPITALIST DEVELOPMENT. THAT WHICH THE
      GREAT TEACHER OF COMMUNISM WAS PREACHING SEVENTY YEARS AGO, IS BEING
      FULFILLED TODAY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL.</P>
