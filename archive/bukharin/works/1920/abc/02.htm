    <H4>§ 14 The struggle between small-scale and large-scale production
    (between Working Ownership and Capitalistic Non-working Ownership)</H4>
    
    <P><I>The struggle between small-scale and large-scale capital in
      manufacturing industry</I>. Huge factories, sometimes employing more than
      ten thousand workers, and having enormous machines, did not always exist.
      They appeared by degrees, growing up upon the remnants of artisan
      production and small-scale industry when these were undergoing ruin. In
      order to understand why this came about, we must first of all take into
      account the circumstance that, under private property and commodity
      production, a struggle for buyers, <I>competition</I>, is inevitable. Who
      is the winner in this struggle? He is the winner who knows how to attract
      buyers to himself and to wrest them from his competitors. Now the chief
      means for the attraction of buyers is to offer commodities for sale at a
      lower price.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP> Who
      can sell at a very low price? This is the first question we have to
      answer. It is obvious that the large-scale producer can sell more cheaply
      than the small-scale producer or the independent artisan, for the
      large-scale producer can buy more cheaply. Large-scale production has in
      this respect many advantages. Above all, large-scale production has this
      advantage, that the entrepreneur who commands much capital can install
      better machinery, and can procure better tools and apparatus generally.
      The independent artisan or the, small master finds it very difficult to
      get along; he cannot usually command a power plant; he dares not think of
      installing better and larger machines; he has not the wherewithal to buy
      them. Nor is the small capitalist able to procure the, newest machines.
      Consequently, THE LARGER THE UNDERTAKING, THE MORE PERFECT IS THE
      TECHNIQUE, THE MORE ECONOMICAL IS THE LABOUR, AND THE LOWER IS THE COST OF
      PRODUCTION.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the large factories of the United States and Germany
      there are actually scientific laboratories where new and improved methods
      are continually being discovered. Thus science is wedded to industry. The
      discoveries made in such a laboratory remain secrets of the enterprise to
      which it is attached, and bring profit to that enterprise alone. In
      small-scale production and hand production, one and the same worker
      conducts nearly all the stages of production. In machine production, on
      the other hand, where numerous workers are employed, one worker is
      responsible for one stage only, a second worker for a second stage, a
      third for a third, and so on. In this way, under the system known as the
      <I>division of labour</I>, the work goes much quicker. How great is the
      advantage of this system was made manifest by some American researches
      instituted in the year 1898. Here are the results. <I>The manufacture of
      10 ploughs</I>. By hand labour: 2 workers, performing 11 distinct
      operations, worked in all 1,180 hours, and received $54. By machine
      labour: 52 workers, performing 97 operations (the more numerous the
      workers, the more varied the operations), worked in all 37 hours and 28
      minutes, and received $7.90. (We see that the time was enormously less and
      that the cost of labour was very much lower.) <I>The manufacture of 100
      sets of clock wheels</I>. By hand labour: 14 workers, 453 operations,
      341,866 hours, $80.82. By machine labour: 10 workers, 1,088 operations,
      8343 hours, $1.80. <I>The manufacture of </I>500 <I>yards of cloth</I>.
      Hand labour: 3 workers, 19 operations, 7,534 hours, $135.6. Machine
      labour: 252 workers, 43 operations, 84 hours, $6.81. Many similar examples
      might be given. Furthermore, small manufacturers and hand workers are
      quite unable to undertake those branches of production for which a highly
      developed mechanical technique is essential. For instance, the manufacture
      of locomotive engines and ironclads ; coal mining; and so on.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Large-scale production effects economies in every direction: in
      buildings, machinery, raw materials, lighting and heating, cost of labour,
      utilization of waste products, etc. In fact, let us suppose that there are
      one thousand small workshops, and that there is one large factory which
      produces the same quantity of commodities as all the little workshops put
      together. It is much easier to build one large factory than a thousand
      small workshops; the raw materials for the workshops will be used far more
      wastefully; lighting and heating will be much easier in the case of the
      large factory; the factory will have the advantage in the matter of
      general supervision, cleaning up, repairs, etc. In a word, there will
      unquestionably be in all respects an economy, a saving, in running the
      large factory.</P>
    
    <P>In the purchase of raw materials and of all that is necessary for
      production, large-scale capital is likewise at an advantage. The wholesale
      buyer buys more cheaply, and the goods are of better quality; furthermore,
      the great factory owner is better acquainted with the market, knows better
      where to buy cheaply. In like manner, the small enterprise is always at a
      disadvantage when entering the market as seller. Not only does the
      largescale producer know better where to buy cheaply (for this purpose, he
      has travellers; he conducts his business in the exchange, where news
      concerning various commodities is always coming in; he has commercial ties
      extending almost all over the world): in addition, he can afford to <I>wait</I>.
      If, for instance, the price of his product is too low, he can retain it in
      his warehouses, pending a rise in prices. The small producer cannot do
      this. He lives from hand to mouth. As soon as he has sold his product, he
      begins to use for immediate expenses the money he has received; he has no
      margin. For this reason he is forced to sell willy-nilly, for otherwise he
      will starve to death. It is obvious that this is a great disadvantage to
      him.</P>
    
    <P>It need hardly be said that large-scale production enjoys an additional
      advantage, in the matter of <I>credit</I>. If a great entrepreneur has
      urgent need of money, he can get it. Banks will always lend money to a
      solid' firm at a comparatively low rate of interest. But hardly anyone
      will give credit to the small producer. If he can borrow at all,
      exorbitant interest will be demanded. Thus the small producer easily falls
      into the hands of the usurer.</P>
    
    <P>All these advantages attaching to large-scale enterprise explain why
      smallscale production must invariably succumb in capitalist society.
      Largescale capital crushes the small producer, takes away his customers,
      and ruins him, so that he drops into the ranks of the proletariat or
      becomes a tramp. In many cases, of course, the small master continues to
      cling to life. He fights desperately, puts his own hand to the work,
      forces his workers and his family to labour with all their strength; but
      in the end he is compelled to give up his place to the great capitalist.
      In many instances, one who seems to be an independent master is in truth
      entirely dependent on large-scale capital, works for it, and cannot take a
      single step without its permission. The small producer is frequently in
      the toils of the moneylender. Ostensibly independent, he really works for
      this spider. Or he is a dependent of the purchaser of his commodities. In
      other cases he is a dependent of the shop for which he works. In the last
      instance, though apparently independent, he has really become a wage
      worker in the service of the capitalist who owns the large shop. It may
      happen that the capitalist provides him with raw materials, and sometimes
      with tools as well; in Russia many of those engaged in home industry are
      in this position. In such cases it is perfectly clear that the home worker
      has become a satellite of capital. Another form of subordination to
      capital is that in which small repairing workshops are grouped around a
      large undertaking, so that they are, as it were, mere screws in the wall
      of the big building. Their independence is only apparent. We sometimes see
      that small masters, independent artisans, home workers, traders, or petty
      capitalists, when they have been driven out of one branch of manufacture
      or commerce, enter some other branch in which large-scale capital is less
      powerful. In many cases, persons who have been ruined in this way become
      small traders, pedlars, and the like. Thus largescale capital tends, step
      by step, to replace small production everywhere. Huge enterprises come
      into existence, each employing thousands or tens of thousands of workers.
      Large-scale capital is becoming the ruler of the world. The working owner
      is disappearing. His place is being taken by large-scale capital.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">As examples of the decline of small-scale production in
      <I>Russia</I>, let us consider the home workers. Some of these, such as
      furriers and basketweavers, worked with their own raw materials and sold
      to anyone who would buy. In course of time the home worker began to work
      for one particular capitalist; this is what happened in the case of the
      Moscow hatmakers, toymakers, brushmakers, etc. In the next stage, home
      workers procure the raw materials from their own employer, and thus pass
      into bondage to him (e.g. the locksmiths of Pavlovsk and of Burmakino).
      Finally, the home worker is paid by his employer at piecework rates (the
      nailmakers of Tver, the bootmakers of Kimry, the matmakers of Makarieff,
      the knifeforgers of Pavlovo). The hand-loom weavers have been similarly
      enslaved. In <I>England</I>, the expiring system of small-scale
      production was nick-named the sweating system', owing to the abominable
      conditions that prevailed. In <I>Germany</I>, during the period 1882 to
      1895, the number of small enterprises diminished by 8.6 per cent; the
      number of middle-sized enterprises (those employing from 6 to 50 workers)
      increased by 64.1 per cent; and the number of great enterprises increased
      by 90 per cent. Since 1895 a notable number of middle-sized enterprises
      have also been crushed out. In <I>Russia</I>, the victory of the factory
      system over home industry has been fairly rapid. The textile industry
      (weaving) is one of the most important branches of manufacture in Russia.
      If we consider the changes that have taken place in the cotton industry,
      if we compare the number of factory workers with the number of home
      workers, we are able to judge how rapidly the factory system is displacing
      home industry. Here are the figures:</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the year 1866, for every hundred workers engaged as
      weavers in cotton factories, there were 70 weavers working at home; in the
      years 1894-5, for every hundred factory workers there were only 8 home
      workers. In Russia the growth of large-scale production was
      extraordinarily rapid because foreign capital undertook its direct
      organization. By the year 1902, large enterprises were already employing
      nearly half (40 per cent) of all the Russian industrial workers.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In 1903, in European Russia, the factories employing
      more than 100 workers numbered 17 per cent of all factories and workshops;
      and of the total number of workers engaged in factories and workshops 76.7
      per cent worked in these large factories.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The victory of large-scale production all over the
      world entails much suffering for small producers. Sometimes whole
      occupations perish and entire districts are depopulated (e.g. the Silesian
      weavers in Germany, the Indian weavers, etc.).</FONT></P>
    
    <P>(B) <I>The struggle between small-scale and large-scale capital in
      agriculture</I>. The same struggle between small-scale and largescale
      production which is carried on in industry, occurs also under capitalism
      in agriculture. The landlord, who administers his estate just as the
      capitalist administers his factory; the rich peasant, grasping and
      usurious; the middle peasant; the poor peasant, who often accepts a job
      from the landlord or the rich peasant; and the agricultural labourer - we
      may compare this agricultural series with the industrial series of great
      capitalist, small capitalist, independent artisan, home worker, wage
      worker. In the country, as in the town, extensive possessions give an
      advantage when compared with small.</P>
    
    <P>On a large farm, it is comparatively easy to introduce up-to-date
      methods. Agricultural machinery (electric or steam ploughs, harvesters,
      cutters and binders, drillers, threshers, steam threshers, etc.) is almost
      beyond the reach of the small farmer. The independent artisan cannot think
      of installing expensive machinery in his little workshop; he has no money
      to pay for it, nor could he turn such machinery to good account even if he
      could buy it. In like manner, the peasant cannot buy a steam plough, for,
      if he had the money, a steam plough would be of no use to him. A great
      machine like this, for its profitable utilization, needs a large area of
      land; it is valueless on a patch where there is hardly room for a
      fowl-run.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The efficient utilization of machinery and tools
      depends on the area of land under cultivation. For the full utilization of
      a horse plough we need 30 hectares of land; for that of a set comprising
      driller, harvester, and thresher, about 70 hectares; for a steam thresher,
      about 250 hectares; for a steam plough, about 1,000 hectares. Recently,
      machines driven by electric power have been used in agriculture; for
      these, also, large-scale farming; is indispensable.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>As a rule, only for farming on the large scale is it practicable to
      undertake irrigation, to drain swamps, to provide field drainage (the
      laying of earthenware pipes in the fields to carry off superfluous water),
      to build light railways, and so on. In agriculture, just as in
      manufacturing industry, where work is done on a large scale we save upon
      tools and machinery, materials, labour power, fuel, lighting, etc.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In large-scale farming, there will be per desyatina
      less waste space between the fields, fewer hedges, ditches, and fences;
      less seed will be lost in these waste areas.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Furthermore, the owner of a large farm finds it worth while to engage
      expert agriculturists, and he can work his land by thoroughly scientific
      methods.</P>
    
    <P>In matters of trade and credit, what applies to industry, applies also
      to agriculture. The large-scale farmer is better acquainted with the
      market, he can await favourable opportunities, he can buy all he needs
      more cheaply, can sell at a better price. Only one thing remains for the
      small competitor; he struggles with all his might. Small-scale agriculture
      is able to continue in existence only through strenuous labour, in
      conjunction with the restriction of needs, with semi-starvation. Thus
      alone can it maintain itself under the capitalist régime. It
      suffers still more severely owing to heavy taxation. The capitalist State
      lays crushing burdens upon the smallholder. It suffices to remember what
      tsarist taxation signified to the peasant Sell all you have, so long as
      you pay your taxes.'</P>
    
    <P>In general it may be said that small-scale production is far more
      tenacious of life in agriculture than in manufacturing industry. In the
      towns, the independent artisans and other small-scale producers are for
      the most part rapidly undergoing ruin, but in the rural districts of all
      countries peasant farming still leads a tolerably sturdy existence.
      Nevertheless, in the country, too, the impoverishment of the majority
      proceeds apace, only here the results are less obvious than in the towns:
      Sometimes it seems, as far as the amount of land is concerned, that an
      agricultural enterprise is very small, when in reality it is quite an
      extensive affair, because much capital has been put into it, and because
      it employs a considerable number of workers; this applies, for instance,
      to market gardens in the neighbourhood of large towns. Sometimes, on the
      other hand, those who seem to be independent smallholders are really for
      the most part wage workers; sometimes they are employed on neighbouring
      farms, sometimes they engage in seasonal occupations elsewhere, and
      sometimes they work in the towns. What is happening to the independent
      artisans and to the home workers, is in like manner happening to the
      peasants of all lands. A few of them become 'kulaks' (liquor sellers,
      usurers, rich peasants who by degrees round off their possessions). Some
      of them manage to struggle on as they are. The remainder are ultimately
      ruined, they sell their cow and their nag, becoming 'horseless men';
      finally, the plot of land goes the way of the rest, the man will either
      settle in the town or make his living as an agricultural labourer. The
      'horseless man' becomes a wage worker, whereas the kulak, the rich peasant
      who hires workers, becomes a landlord or a capitalist.</P>
    
    <P>Thus in agriculture a vast quantity of land, tools, machines, cattle,
      horses, etc., passes into the hands of a small group of capitalist
      landlords, for whom millions of workers labour, and upon whom millions of
      peasants are dependent.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the <I>United States</I>, where the capitalist
      system has developed more fully than elsewhere, there are great estates
      which are worked like factories. And just as, in factories, only one
      product is turned out, so it happens on these farms. There may be huge
      fields where nothing but strawberries are grown, or gigantic orchards;
      enormous poultry farms; colossal wheat fields, worked by machinery. Many
      branches of agricultural production are concentrated in a few hands. In
      this way, for example, there comes to exist a chicken king' (a capitalist
      into whose hands is concentrated, more or less completely, the rearing of
      chickens), an egg king', and so on.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><A NAME="015"></A> </P>
    
    <H4>§ 15 The dependent position of the proletariat; the reserve army
    of labour; women's labour and child labour</H4>
    
    <P>Under capitalism, the masses of the population are to an increasing
      extent transformed into wage workers. Ruined artisans, home workers,
      peasants, traders, minor capitalists - in a word, all who have been thrown
      overboard, who have been driven down by large-scale capital, fall into the
      ranks of the proletariat. The more that wealth undergoes concentration and
      passes into the hands of a small group of capitalists, the more do the
      masses of the people become the wage slaves of these capitalists.</P>
    
    <P>Owing to the continuous decay of the middle strata and classes, the
      number of the workers always exceeds the requirements of capital. For this
      reason, the workers are bound hand and foot by capitalism. The worker must
      work for the capitalist. If he refuses, the employer can find a hundred
      others to take his place.</P>
    
    <P>But this dependence upon capital has another cause besides the ruin of
      new and ever-new strata of the population. The dominion of capital over
      the workers is further strengthened by the way in which the capitalist is
      continually turning superfluous workers into the street and making of them
      a reserve of labour power. How does this come about? As follows. We have
      already seen that every factory owner endeavours to reduce the cost of
      production. This is why he is continually installing new machinery. But
      the machine commonly replaces labour, renders part of the workers
      superfluous. The introduction of new machinery signifies that some of the
      workers will be discharged. Among those hitherto employed in the factory,
      a certain number will be thrown out of work. Since, however, new machinery
      is perpetually being introduced in one branch of production or another, it
      is clear that <I>unemployment must always exist under capitalism. </I>For
      the capitalist is not concerned to provide work for all, or to supply
      goods to everyone; his aim is to secure increasing profit. Obviously,
      therefore, he will discharge any workers who are unable to produce for him
      as much profit as before.</P>
    
    <P>In actual fact, we see in all capitalist countries a huge number of
      unemployed workers in every large city. Among the ranks of these
      unemployed we find Chinese and Japanese workers, ruined peasants who have
      come from the ends of the earth in search of work; we find lads fresh from
      the country, ex-shopkeepers, and ex-artisans. We find also metal workers,
      printers, textile workers, and the like, men who have worked in factories
      for years, and have then been thrown out of employment owing to the
      introduction of new machinery. They all combine to form a reserve supply
      of labour power for capital, to form what Marx termed the <I>reserve army
      of labour</I>. Owing to the existence of this reserve army of labour,
      owing to perennial unemployment, the dependence and subjection of the
      working class continually increase. With the aid of new machinery, capital
      is able to extract more gold from some of the workers, while the others,
      the superfluous workers, are thrown into the street. But those who have
      been thrown into the street constitute a scourge in the hands of the
      capitalist, a whip which he uses to keep in order those who remain in
      employment.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The industrial reserve army gives examples of complete
      brutalization, destitution, starvation, death, and even crime. Those who
      are out of work for years, gradually take to drink, become loafers,
      tramps, beggars, etc. In great cities - London, New York, Hamburg, Berlin,
      Paris - there are whole quarters inhabited by these out-of-works. As far
      as Moscow is concerned, Hitrof Market furnishes a similar example. Here,
      we no longer find the proletariat, but a new stratum, consisting of those
      who have forgotten how to work. This product of capitalist society is
      known as the <I>lumpenproletariat </I> (loafer-proletariat).</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The introduction of machinery also led to the employment of <I>women's
      labour </I>and child <I>labour</I>, which are cheaper, and are therefore
      more profitable to the capitalist. In earlier days, before the
      introduction of machinery, special skill was requisite for the work of
      production, and sometimes a long term of apprenticeship was indispensable.
      Some machines can be managed by children; all that is necessary is to move
      the arm or the leg until fatigue becomes overpowering. This is why, after
      the invention of machinery, the labour of women and children came to be
      more widely used. Women and children offer less resistance than male
      workers to capitalist oppression. They are more submissive, more easily
      intimidated; they are more ready to believe the priest and to accept
      everything they are told by persons in authority. Hence the factory owner
      often replaces male workers by females, and compels little children to
      transmute their blood for him into the golden coins of profit.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the year 1913, the number of women workers of all
      kinds (i.e. not manual workers alone) was as follows: France, 6,800,000;
      Germany,9,400,000; Austria-Hungary, 8,200,000; Italy, 5,700,000; Belgium,
      930,000; USA, 8,000,000; England and Wales, 6,000,000. In Russia, the
      number of women workers continually increased. In 1900, the women workers
      numbered 25 per cent of all factory workers; in 1908, they numbered 31 per
      cent; in 1912, 45 per cent. In some branches of production, the women
      outnumbered the men. For example, in the textile industry, out of 870,000
      workers in the year 1912, 453000 were women - more than half, over 52 per
      cent. During the war, the number of women workers increased enormously.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">As regards child labour, this flourishes in many
      places, despite prohibitions. In countries of advanced capitalist
      development, as for instance in the USA, child labour is met with at every
      turn.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>This leads to the break-up of the working-class family. If the mothers,
      and very often the children as well, go to the factory, what becomes of
      family life?</P>
    
    <P>When a woman enters the factory, when she becomes a wage worker, she is
      from time to time exposed, just like a man, to all the hardships of
      unemployment. She, likewise, is shown the door by the capitalist; she,
      likewise, joins the ranks of the industrial reserve army; she, just like a
      man, is liable to undergo moral degradation. Associated with this we have
      <I>prostitution</I>, when a woman sells herself to the first comer in the
      street. Nothing to eat, no work, hunted from everywhere; and even if she
      has work, the wages are so low that she may be compelled to supplement her
      earnings by the sale.of her body. After a time, the new trade becomes
      habitual. Thus arises the caste of professional prostitutes.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In big towns, prostitutes are found in very large
      numbers. In such cities as Hamburg and London, these unfortunates are
      reckoned by tens of thousands. Capital uses them as a source of profit and
      enrichment, organizing vast brothels on capitalistic lines. There is an
      extensive international commerce in white slaves. The towns of Argentina
      used to be the centres of this traffic. Especially repulsive is child
      prostitution, which flourishes in all European and American towns.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>In capitalist society, as better and better machinery is invented, as
      larger and larger factories are built, and as the quantity of commodities
      increases, there is a concomitant increase in capitalist oppression, the
      industrial reserve army becomes more degraded and impoverished, and the
      working class grows more dependent upon its exploiters.</P>
    
    <P>If private ownership did not exist, if everything were co-operatively
      owned, a very different state of affairs would prevail. Then people would
      shorten the working day, would husband their strength, economize toil,
      enjoy ample leisure. When the capitalist introduces machinery, his concern
      is for profit; he does not think of reducing the working day, for he would
      only lose by this. The capitalist does not use machinery to emancipate
      people, but to enslave them. As capitalism develops, an ever-increasing
      proportion of capital is devoted to machinery, enormous buildings, huge
      furnaces, and so on. On the other hand, the proportion of capital expended
      upon the wages of labour grows continually smaller. In earlier days, when
      hand labour still prevailed, the expenditure upon looms and other gear was
      trifling; nearly all the expenditure of capital was upon the wages of
      labour. Now, conversely, much the larger portion is devoted to buildings 
      and machinery. The result is that the demand for working hands does not
      keep pace with the increase in the number of proletarians, does not
      suffice to absorb the influx of those who are ruined by capitalism. The
      more vigorous the advance of technique under capitalism, the more cruelly
      does capital oppress the working class; for it grows ever harder to find
      work, more and more difficult to live.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="016"></A> </P>
    
    <H4>§ 16 The anarchy of production; competition; crises</H4>
    
    <P>The miseries of the working class continually increase concomitantly
      with the progress of manufacturing technique. Under capitalism this
      progress, instead of bringing advantages to all, brings increased profit
      to capital, but unemployment and ruin to many workers. There are, however,
      additional causes for the increasing misery.</P>
    
    <P>We have already learned that capitalist society is very badly
      constructed. Private ownership holds sway, and there is no definite plan
      whatever. Every factory owner conducts his business independently of the
      others. He struggles with his rivals for buyers, competes' with them.</P>
    
    <P>The question now arises whether this struggle becomes enfeebled or
      intensified as capitalism develops.</P>
    
    <P>At first sight it might seem that the struggle is enfeebled. In actual
      fact, the number of capitalists grows continually smaller; the great fish
      eat up the small fry. Whereas in earlier days ten thousand entrepreneurs
      were fighting one with another and competition was embittered, since now
      there are fewer competitors it might be imagined that the rivalry would be
      less acute. But this is not so in reality. The very opposite is the case.
      It is true that there are fewer competitors. But each one of these has
      become enormously stronger than were the rivals of an earlier stage. The
      struggle between them is greater, not less; more violent, not more gentle.
      If in the whole world there should rule only a few capitalists, then these
      capitalist governments would fight with one another. This is what it has
      come to at long last. At the present time the struggle goes on between
      immense combinations of capitalists, between their respective States. 
      Moreover, they fight with one another, not solely by means of competitive
      prices, but also by means of armed force. Thus it is only in respect of
      the number of competitors that competition can be said to diminish as
      capitalism develops; in other respects it grows continually fiercer and
      more destructive.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#2" NAME="2b">2)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P>One more phenomenon must now be considered, the occurrence of what are
      termed crises. What are these crises? What is their real nature? The
      matter may be stated as follows. One fine day it appears that various
      commodities have been produced in excessive quantities. Prices fall, but
      the stock of goods cannot be cleared. The warehouses are filled with all
      kinds of products, for which there is no sale; buyers are lacking.
      Needless to say, there are plenty of hungry workers, but they receive no
      more than a pittance, and cannot buy anything in excess of their usual
      purchases. Then calamity ensues. In some particular branch of industry the
      small and middle-sized undertakings collapse first, and are closed down;
      next comes the failure of the larger enterprises. But the branch of
      production thus affected bought commodities from another branch of
      production this latter bought from a third. For instance, tailors buy
      cloth from the cloth makers; these buy wool from the yarn spinners; and so
      on. The tailors come to grief, and in consequence there are no customers
      for the cloth makers. Now the cloth makers fail, and their failure reacts
      upon the firms that supply them with woollen yarn. Factories and workshops
      everywhere close their doors, tens of thousands of workers are thrown on
      the streets, unemployment grows to unprecedented proportions, the workers'
      life becomes even worse. Yet there are plenty of commodities. The
      warehouses are bursting with them. This was continually happening before
      the war. Industry flourishes; the manufacturers' businesses work at high
      pressure. Suddenly there is a crash, followed by misery and unemployment,
      and business is at a standstill. After a time, recovery sets in; there
      comes a renewed period of excessive activity, to be followed in turn by a
      new collapse. The cycle is repeated over and over again.</P>
    
    <P>How can we explain this absurd state of affairs, wherein people become
      paupers in the midst of wealth?</P>
    
    <P>The question is not easy to answer. But we must answer it.</P>
    
    <P>We have already learned that in capitalist society there prevails a
      disorder, or so to say an anarchy, of production. Every factory owner,
      every entrepreneur, produces for himself, on his own responsibility, and
      at his own risk. The natural result in these circumstances is that sooner
      or later too many commodities are produced - there is overproduction. When
      there was production of goods but not of commodities, when, that is to
      say, production was not effected for the market, then there was no danger
      of overproduction. It is quite otherwise in the case of commodity
      production. Every manufacturer, in order that he may buy what he requires
      for further production, must first of all sell his own products. If in any
      particular place there is a stoppage of machinery on account of the
      anarchy of production, the trouble quickly spreads from one branch of
      production to another, so that a universal crisis ensues.</P>
    
    <P>These crises have a devastating influence. Large quantities of goods
      perish. The remnants of small-scale production are swept away as if by an
      iron broom. Even the big firms often fail.</P>
    
    <P>Most of the burden of these crises is of course borne by the working
      class.</P>
    
    <P>Some factories close down altogether; others reduce production, working
      only half-time; others are temporarily closed. The number of unemployed
      increases. The industrial reserve army grows larger. Simultaneously there
      is an increase in the poverty and oppression of the working class. During
      these crises, the condition of the working class, bad at the best of
      times, grows even worse.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Let us consider, for example, the data of the crisis of
      1907-10, affecting both Europe and America, in fact the whole capitalist
      world. In the <I>United States</I>, the number of unemployed trade
      unionists increased as follows: June, 1907, 8.1 per cent; October, 18.5
      per cent; November, 22 per cent; December, 32.7 per cent (in the building
      trades, 42 per cent; in the dressmaking trade, 43.6 per cent; among
      tobacco workers, 55 per cent). It goes without saying that the total
      number of unemployed, taking into account the unorganized workers as well,
      was still larger. In <I>England</I>, the percentage of unemployed in the
      summer of 1907 was 3.4 to 4 per cent; in November, it rose to 5 per cent;
      in December, to 6.1 per cent; in June,1908, it reached 8.2 per cent. In
      <I>Germany</I>, during January, 1908, the percentage of unemployed was
      twice as great as during the same month of the previous year. Like
      conditions were observable in other countries.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">As regards the falling-off in production, it may be
      mentioned that in the United States the production of cast-iron, which had
      been 26,000,000 tons in 1907, was only 16,000,000 tons in 1908.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In times of crisis, the price of commodities falls. The
      capitalist magnates, eager to continue profit making, do not hesitate to
      impair the quality of production. The coffee-growers of Brazil dumped
      innumerable sacks of coffee into the sea in order to keep up prices. At
      the present time the whole world is suffering from hunger and from the
      nonproduction of goods, the result of the capitalist war. For these things
      are the offspring of capitalism, which decreed the disastrous war. In
      times of peace, capitalism was overwhelmed by a glut of products, which,
      however, did not advantage the workers. Their pockets were empty. The glut
      brought nothing to the workers except unemployment, with all its attendant
      evils.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><A NAME="017"></A> </P>
    
    <H4>§ 17 The development of capitalism and of class. The
    intensification of the class struggle</H4>
    
    <P>We have seen that capitalist society is affected by two fundamental
      contradictions, two fundamental ills. In the first place, it is
      'anarchistic'; it lacks organization. In the second place, it is in fact
      composed of two mutually hostile societies (classes). We have also seen
      that, as capitalism develops, the anarchy of production, finding
      expression in competition, leads to everincreasing strife, disorder, and
      ruin. The disintegration of society, far from diminishing, is actually
      increasing. Now all this arises from the splitting-up of society into two
      portions, into classes. As capitalism develops, this severance, this
      cleavage between classes, likewise continues to increase. On one side,
      that of the capitalists, all the riches of the world are heaped up; on the
      other side, that of the oppressed classes, is an accumulation of misery,
      bitterness, and tears. The industrial reserve army gives birth to a
      stratum of debased and brutalized individuals, crushed to the earth by
      extreme poverty. But even those who remain at work are sharply
      distinguished from the capitalists by their manner of life. The
      differentiation of the proletariat from the bourgeoisie continually
      increases. Formerly there was quite a number of lesser capitalists, many
      of whom had close relationships with the workers and lived little better
      than these. Things are very different today. The lords of capital live in
      a manner of which no one dreamed in earlier days. It is true that the
      workers' standard of life has improved in the course of capitalist
      development. Down to the beginning of the twentieth century, there
      occurred a general rise in wages. But during this same period, capitalist
      profits increased still more rapidly. Today there is a great gulf fixed
      between the toiling masses and the capitalist class. The capitalist now
      leads an entirely different sort of life; he himself produces nothing. The
      more capitalism develops, the more exalted becomes the position of the
      small group of extremely wealthy capitalists, and the wider grows the
      chasm between these uncrowned kings and the millions upon millions of
      enslaved proletarians.</P>
    
    <P>We have said that the wages of the workers have risen on the whole, but
      that profit has increased still more rapidly, and that for this reason the
      chasm between the two classes has widened. Since the beginning of the
      twentieth century, however, wages have not risen but fallen; whereas
      during the same period profits have increased as never before. Hence there
      has during recent years been an exceptionally rapid increase in social
      inequality.</P>
    
    <P>It is perfectly clear that this social inequality, in its continued
      growth, must sooner or later lead to a clash between the workers and the
      capitalists. If the contrast between the two classes were diminishing, if
      the life conditions of the workers were becoming approximated to those of
      the capitalists, then, of course, we might look for a 'time of peace on
      earth and goodwill towards men'. What actually occurs, however, is that in
      capitalist society the worker is day by day farther removed from the
      capitalist instead of drawing nearer to him. The inevitable result of this
      is a continuous accentuation of the class war between the proletariat and
      the bourgeoisie.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Bourgeois theorists put forward many objections to such
      a view. They would like to show that in capitalist society the condition
      of the working class undergoes continuous improvement. The socialists of
      the right wing sing the same tune. Writers of both these schools contend
      that the workers grow gradually richer, and can look forward to becoming
      petty capitalists themselves. Such expectations have been falsified. In
      actual fact the condition of the workers as compared with' that of the
      capitalists has persistently grown worse. Here is an example drawn from
      the United States, the land of most advanced capitalist development. If we
      consider the purchasing power of labour (that is to say, the quantity of
      necessaries which the workers can buy), taking the years from 1890-99 as a
      standard at 100, the purchasing power in various years was as follows:
      1890, 98.6; 1895, 100.6; 1900, 103.0; 1905, 101.4; 1907, 101.5. This means
      that the workers' standard of life has undergone practically no
      improvement. The quantities of food, clothing, etc., bought by the average
      worker in 1890 was increased by no more than 3 per cent in subsequent
      years; this was the utmost rise in the purchasing power of his wages. But
      during the same period the American millionaires, the industrial magnates,
      were making enormous profits, and the quantity of surplus value they were
      receiving was increasing to an immeasurable extent. As far as the
      capitalist standard of life, capitalist luxuries, and capitalist incomes,
      are concerned, it is obvious that these were increased many times over.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The class war arises out of the conflict of interests between the
      bourgeoisie and the proletariat. These interests are as essentially
      irreconcilable as are the respective interests of wolves and sheep.</P>
    
    <P>It is plain that the capitalist will find it advantageous to make the
      workers work as long as possible and to pay them as little as possible; on
      the other hand, the workers will find it advantageous to work for the
      minimum hours and for the maximum wages. Obviously, therefore, since the
      time when the working class first began to exist, there must have been a
      struggle for higher wages and shorter hours.</P>
    
    <P>This struggle has never been interrupted, and has never been stilled. It
      has not, however, been restricted to a struggle for a trifling advance in
      wages. Wherever the capitalist system has developed, the toiling masses
      have become convinced that they must make an end of capitalism itself. The
      workers began to consider how this detested system could be replaced by a
      just and comradely system based upon work. Such was the origin of the
      communist movement of the working class.</P>
    
    <P>In their struggle, the workers have experienced numerous defeats. But
      the capitalist system bears within its womb the final victory of the
      proletariat. Why? For this reason, because the development of capitalism
      entails the proletarianization of the broad masses of the people. The
      victory of large-scale capital effects the ruin of independent artisans,
      small traders, and peasants; it swells the ranks of the wage workers. At
      each step in capitalist development, the proletariat grows more numerous.
      It is like the Hydra, the many-headed monster of fable; if you cut off one
      of its heads, ten new ones grow. When the bourgeoisie suppressed a working
      class rising, it thereby strengthened the capitalist system. But the
      development of this capitalist system ruined petty proprietors and
      peasants by the million, throwing them under the feet of the capitalists.
      By this very process it increased the number of proletarians, the enemies
      of the capitalist class. But the increase in strength of the working class
      was not numerical merely. In addition, the working class became more
      strongly integrated. Why did this happen? Because, as capitalism
      developed, there was an increase in the number of great factories. Each
      great factory assembles within its walls a thousand workers, sometimes as
      many as ten thousand. These workers labour shoulder to shoulder. They
      recognize how their capitalist employer is exploiting them. They perceive
      that to each worker his fellow-workers are friends and comrades. In the
      course of their work the proletarians, united in the factory, learn how to
      unite forces. They more readily come to an agreement one with another.
      That is why, as capitalism develops, there is not merely an increase in
      the number of the workers, but an increase in <I>working class solidarity</I>.</P>
    
    <P>The more rapidly huge factories extend, the more rapidly does capitalism
      develop, and the more speedy is the ruin of independent artisans, home
      workers, and peasants. The faster, likewise is the growth of gigantic
      cities with millions of inhabitants. Finally, in large towns, there is
      gathered together upon a comparatively restricted area an immense mass of
      persons, and the great majority of them belong to the factory proletariat.
      These masses are housed in foul and smoky quarters of the town, whilst the
      small group of the master class, the owners of all things, lives in
      luxurious mansions. The numbers of those constituting this small group are
      continually diminishing. The workers incessantly increase in numbers and
      their solidarity grows ever greater.</P>
    
    <P>Under such conditions, the inevitable increase in the intensity of the
      struggle cannot fail in the long run to lead to the victory of the working
      class. Sooner or later, notwithstanding all the wiles of the bourgeoisie,
      the workers will come into violent collision with the master class, will
      dethrone it, will destroy its robber government, and will create for
      themselves a new order, a communist order based on labour. In this manner,
      capitalism, by its own development, inevitably leads to the communist
      revolution of the proletariat.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The class struggle of the proletariat against the
      bourgeoisie has assumed various forms. Three leading types of working
      class organization have arisen in the course of this struggle. First of
      all we have the <I>trade unions</I>, grouping the workers according to
      occupation. Next come the <I>cooperatives</I>, which are mainly concerned
      with distribution, for it is their aim to free the workers from the grip
      of middlemen and traders. Last of all we have the <I>political parties</I>
      of the working class (socialist, socialdemocrat, and communist) whose
      programme it is to guide the working class in its struggle for political
      power. The fiercer the struggle between the two classes became, the more
      essential was it that all sections of the working class movement should
      concentrate upon a single aim - the overthrow of the bourgeois State.
      Those leaders of the working class movement who have most perfectly
      realized the situation have always insisted upon the necessity for a close
      collaboration between all working class organizations. They pointed out,
      for example, the essential need for unity of action between the trade
      unions and the political parties of the proletariat; and they declared
      that the trade unions could not remain neutral' (that is to say,
      indifferent in political matters). The unions, they said, must march
      shoulder to shoulder with the political parties of the working class.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Quite recently, the workers' movement has assumed yet
      newer forms. The most important of these is the constitution of <I>councils
      of workers' delegates</I> (soviets). We shall have to speak of these again
      and again in the course of the book.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Thus from our study of the development of the capitalist system we can
      confidently deduce the following conclusions: THE NUMBER OF THE
      CAPITALISTS GROWS SMALLER, BUT THESE FEW CAPITALISTS GROW RICHER AND
      STRONGER; THE NUMBER OF THE WORKERS CONTINUALLY INCREASES, AND WORKING
      CLASS SOLIDARITY LIKEWISE INCREASES, THOUGH NOT TO THE SAME EXTENT; THE
      CONTRAST BETWEEN THE WORKERS AND THE CAPITALISTS GROWS EVER GREATER.
      INEVITABLY, THEREFORE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPITALISM LEADS TO A CLASH
      BETWEEN THE TWO CLASSES, THAT IS, IT LEADS TO THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTION.</P>

    <H4>§ 18 The concentration and centralization of capital as causal
    factors of communism</H4>
    
    <P>Capitalism, as we have seen, digs its own grave. For it creates its own
      grave-diggers, the proletarians. The more it develops, the more does it
      multiply those who are its mortal enemies, and the more does it unite them
      against itself. But it does not merely breed its enemies. It likewise
      prepares the ground for a new organization of social production, for a new
      economic order which will be comradely and communistic. How does it do
      this? We shall speedily give the answer.</P>
    
    <P>We have previously seen (glance at or reread <A HREF="01.htm#011">§11</A>
      'Capital') that capital is continually increasing in amount. The
      capitalist adds to his capital, part of the surplus value which he
      extracts from the working class. By such means, capital grows larger. But
      if capital increases in amount, this implies that production must extend.
      The increase in capital, the growth of the amount held by one pair of
      hands, is termed the <I>accumulation </I>or <I>concentration of capital</I>.</P>
    
    <P>We have likewise seen (refer to <A HREF="#014">§14</A>. The
      struggle between large-scale and small-scale production') that the
      development of capitalism involves the decay of small-scale and
      mediumscale production; that the small and medium producers and traders
      are ruined, not to speak of the independent artisans; we have seen that
      the great capitalist gobbles them all up. The capital which was previously
      owned by the small and medium capitalists slips from their grasp, and by
      various routes finds its way into the maw of the big sharks. The capital
      owned by the great capitalists is consequently increased by the amount
      which they have wrested from the lesser capitalists. There is now an
      accumulation of capital in the hands of one individual, an accumulation of
      what had previously been distributed among various hands. Now, after the
      ruin of the lesser capitalists, their capital has become the spoil of the
      victors. This accumulation of capital which had previously been dispersed
      is spoken of as the <I>centralization of capital</I>.</P>
    
    <P>The concentration and centralization of <I>capital</I>, the
      accumulation of capital in a few hands, does not as yet imply the
      concentration and centralization of <I>production</I>. Let us suppose
      that a capitalist has used the accumulation of surplus value to buy a
      small factory from a neighbour, and that he keeps this factory running on
      the old lines. Here accumulation has taken place, but there is no change
      in production. Usually, however, things take a different course. In actual
      fact it much more frequently happens that the capitalist (because it is
      profitable to him) remodels and extends production, that he enlarges his
      factories. This results, not merely in the expansion of capital, but in
      the expansion of production itself. Production is conducted on an enormous
      scale, utilizing vast quantities of machinery, and assembling many
      thousands of workers. It may happen that a dozen or so of huge factories
      will supply the demand of a whole country for a particular commodity.
      Essentially what happens is that the workers are producing for the whole
      of society, that labour, as the phrase goes, has been <I>socialized</I>.
      But control and profit are still in the hands of the capitalist.</P>
    
    <P>Such a centralization and concentrationof production actually paves the
      way for cooperative production after the proletarian revolution.</P>
    
    <P>Had this concentration of production not taken place, if the proletariat
      were to seize power at a time when the work of production was carried on
      in a hundred thousand tiny workshops each employing no more than two or
      three workers, it would be impossible to organize these workshops
      satisfactorily, to inaugurate social production. The further capitalism
      has developed and the more highly centralized production has become, the
      easier will it be for the proletariat to manage production after the
      victory.</P>
    
    <P>THUS CAPITALISM DOES NOT MERELY CREATE ITS OWN ENEMIES AND DOES NOT ONLY
      LEAD TO THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTION, BUT IT BRINGS INTO BEING THE ECONOMIC
      BASIS FOR THE REALIZATION OF THE COMMUNIST SOCIAL ORDER.</P>
