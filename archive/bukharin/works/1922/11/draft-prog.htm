<h4>Contradictions in the Development of the Capitalist System</h4>

<p class="sm1">&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">The hunt for profits forced the bourgeoisie to develop its productive powers continuously and increasingly, and to extend the sphere of operations of capitalist production. But the fundamental defects of the capitalist system revealed themselves at the same time with ever growing distinctness; these defects inevitably lead to the complete breakdown of the capitalist system.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="sm1">a) Anarchy of Production, Competition, Crises.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">The rule of private property imparts an anarchic character to production, and leads to blind production regulated by no conscious power. This is shown on the one hand in the severe conflicts between various competing concerns and groups of concerns, causing an enormous waste of energy; on the other hand the unregulated production causes periodically recurring crises, accompanied by destruction of productive forces and mass unemployment among the proletariat.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="sm1">b) The Class War.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">To the anarchy of production must be added the class conflicts. Capitalist society, built up on the exploitation of an overwhelming majority of the population by an inconsiderable minority, is torn in two, and its whole history is one of conflicts between the classes.</p>
</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="sm1">c) The Struggle of Capitalism far Domination; Wars.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">The struggle of the capitalist system for world domination leads to a special form of competition among the capitalist states, finally expressed in wars which are equally inevitable accompaniments of capitalism, as are crises and unemployment.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="sm1">d) The Process of Centralization of Capital reflects the Contradictions of Capitalism.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">The extension of capitalist production, involving the development of productive forces, is accompanied by the decay of pre-capitalist economic forms in the competitive struggles, by the decay of a part of the peasantry, by the disappearance of handicraft, by the economic defeat of small and medium capital, and by the open plundering and merciless exploitation of the colonial countries. This process leads on the one hand to an accumulation of capital, to its concentration (centralization) in the hands of a few multi-millionaires, and is, on the other hand, accompanied by a tremendous increase in the numbers of the proletariat which, having passed through the severe school of the capitalist system, becomes the deadly enemy of the bourgeoisie and its system of society.</p>

<p class="sm1">The process of the centralization of capital, and of the extension of the capitalist system, constantly reproduces the fundamental defects of capitalism on an ever-increasing scale. The competition among small capitalists ceases, only to be replaced by one among big capitalists; where competition among big capitalists conies to a standstill, it widens its radius and becomes a competition between the gigantic associations of the millionaires and their states; the crises change from those of local and national character io crises extending over a number of countries, and finally to world crises; the local wars are replaced by alliances and world wars; the class war develops from isolated actions of single groups of workers, first to a national struggle, and then to an international struggle of the world proletariat against the world bourgeoisie</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="sm1">e) Organization of Antagonistic Social Forces.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">The inevitable sharpening of the class antagonisms is accompanied by a simultaneous consolidation of the antagonistic class forces. On the one side the capitalist bourgeoisie forms its associations, secures its state power, and organizes its armed forces; on the other side the working class, brought into one camp and united by the mechanism of capitalist production itself, creates its own powerful organizations, which are sooner or later transformed into weapons of the proletariat in the war against the bourgeoisie and its main support, &ndash; state power.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="sm1">f) Inevitableness of the Breakdown of the Capitalist System.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">The natural course of capitalist evolution thus inevitably sharpens the contradictions of the capitalist system, and finally renders the existence of the system itself impossible. The living force which overthrows the capitalist system is the proletariat, which revolts against its bondage, annihilates the regime of capital, and organizes the systematic economics of Socialism, the premises of which are created by capitalism itself.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="sm1">g) The Pre-requisite of Socialism.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">These premises of the new form of society which has to replace capitalism, are: the concentration of the means of production, a powerful capitalist technique, the science created by capitalist evolution, the workers&rsquo; organizations, which will be able to furnish the first organizers of the new order of society.</p>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="sm1">b) The Monopolist Character of Modern Capitalism.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">The numerous private undertakings competing with one another and destroying each other in this competition, have been replaced by mighty associations of industrial magnates (syndicates and trusts), consolidated by the banks. This new form of capital, in which banking capital amalgamates with industrial capital, in which the possessions of the large landowners also become a part of the general organization through the agency of the banks, where there are cliques of enormously rich financial oligarchies almost possessing the character of hereditary dynasties, bears a sharply accentuated monopolist character. The free competition which has taken the place of the feudal monopolist economics now changes into a monopoly of finance capital.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="sm1">c) New Forms of the Competitive Struggle and its growing Acuteness.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">This organization of capital, essentially monopolist in nature, and frequently causing separate groups of the bourgeoisie of different branches of industry to unite, also gives rise to substantial changes in the type of competitive struggle. Instead of competing by means of low prices, there is a growing tendency to use force openly: boycotts and other forms of pressure within the country itself; high protective duties, tariff wars, the employment of armed force backed by state power &ndash; in international relations. This increasing acuteness of competition is in international economic relations largely due to two facts: first to the general division of the colonies among the greatest capitalist states; secondly, to the extraordinary increase in the export of capital, accompanied by the increased endeavour to fully occupy the territories to which the exported capital flows.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="sm1">d) The State Power of Finance Capital. Militarism. Imperialism</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">Under such conditions state power and its armed forces assume a special significance for the bourgeoisie. The policy of finance capital is directed to rapacious activity of the utmost intensity (Imperialism), requiring enormous reinforcements for armies, air fleets, and every description of means of annihilation. The gigantic development of militarism becomes one of the causes of international competition, increasing the acuteness of the competitive struggle and leading to disastrous wars.</p>
</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="sm1">e) The Central Points of Capitalist Oppression. State Economic Associations. Colonies.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">The process of the centralization of capital on a world scale has thus led to the creation of mighty state capitalist trusts, great powers of finance capital, which have become the central points of the capitalist pressure extending throughout the world, of the capitalist predatory raids, and of the exploitation and enslavement of enormous numbers of proletarian, semi-proletarian, and peasant elements. The weaker bourgeois states exist in direct or indirect dependence on these mighty powers, and live at their mercy. A direct object for enslavement and exploitation is finally formed by the colonies, which number hundreds of millions of working and exploited inhabitants.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="sm1">f) The Anti-capitalist Forces (the Working Class, the Colonies). Hindering tendencies (Labor Aristocracy, Social Democracy etc.).</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">There are two main forces organizing against the mighty organized forces of finance capital: on one side the workers of the capitalist states, on the other the oppressed peoples of the colonies. This basic revolutionary tendency is however temporarily paralyzed by the corruption of a considerable section of the European and American proletariat by the imperialist bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie of the most powerful imperialist states, which have reaped enormous profits by plundering colonies and semi-colonies, have raised the wages of continental workers out of the booty of their plunder, thereby interesting these workers in allegiance to the imperialist &ldquo;Fatherland&rdquo; and in its plunderings. This systematic bribery has taken special effect among the labor aristocracy and among the leading bureaucratic elements of the working class, Social Democrats, and trade unions, which have been perfect tools in the hands of the bourgeoisie.</p>

<p class="sm1">g) Sharpening Contradictions and the War of 1914, &ndash; the Beginning of the Collapse of Capitalism.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">The keen competition among the most powerful of the great powers for the possession of the colonies led to the world war of 1914. This war shook the foundations of capitalist economics to such an extent, rendered the position of the working class so much worse, destroyed so many imperialistic illusions among the proletariat, that it brought on a new historic phase in the disintegration of capitalist production.</p>

<p class="sm1">The war of 1914&ndash;1918 brought about a destruction of productive forces never before experienced in history; it led to the immediate annihilation of gigantic means of production and of the best living working forces of humanity; it caused an unheard of waste of energy as a result of productive power being used for unproductive purposes. The attempt made by the national state capitalist trusts to compensate for this wastage by the perfection of the forms of organization (the subjection of private capitalist enterprises to the state, the so-called State Capitalism) only served to render the struggle between the separate states the more acute.</p>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<p class="sm1">c) The Significance of Soviet Russia.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">It is just for the above reasons that the mere fact of the existence of Soviet Russia is of such significance as an organizing centre of the proletarian world movement. By the mere fact of its existence Soviet Russia drives a wedge into the capitalist system, for it comprises one sixth of the globe, and its structure is in principle opposed to the capitalist regime. Besides this, it represents the most powerful vanguard of the proletarian movement, for here the working class has all the means and auxiliaries of state power at its disposal.</p>

<p class="sm1">d) The Counter-revolutionary Forces (Social Democracy).</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">In the course of development of international revolution, the Social Democracy and the trade unions under its leadership became an extraordinarily powerful counter-revolutionary force. Not only did these abandon the interests of the workers during the war, in that they supported their &quot;own&quot; imperialist governments, but they also supported the rapacious treaties of peace (Brest-Litovsk, Versailles); they stood by the side of the generals (Noske), as an active force, when proletarian uprisings were being drowned in blood: they led an armed resistance against the first proletarian republic (Russia); they treacherously betrayed a proletariat almost in possession of power (Hungary); they became members of the rapacious League of Nations (Thomas); they openly took sides with the employers against the colonial slaves (the English &ldquo;Labor&rdquo; Party). International Social Democracy thus forms the last reserve and strongest support of bourgeois society.</p>

<p class="sm1">The abandonment of imperialist illusions within the working class has freed the proletariat from the influence of the Social Democracy, and forms the soil for the development of the Communist parties, which are uniting in the course of the struggle to form a mighty revolutionary association of revolutionary workers: The Communist International. From out of the chaos and the misery, out of the falling debris of shattered capitalism, out of the mad and monstrous new wars in which the bourgeoisie may destroy the last remnants of its own culture &ndash; out of all this, the Communist International will lead humanity on a new path, and only those who do not follow this path will fall victims to death and decay.</p>

This has been demonstrated by the experiences of the Russian and Hungarian Revolution, which greatly widened the experience gained by the Paris Commune of 1871.

The mass organizations of the workers, which are at best merely tolerated under bourgeois dictatorship, form in the Proletarian Democracy the main supports and organs of the proletarian state every where.</p>

<p class="sm1">The Soviet State differs from Bourgeois Democracy in that it openly reveals its class character, and openly sets itself the task of suppressing the exploiters in the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population.</p>

<p class="sm1">While the Bourgeois Democracy does not touch the monopoly of the capitalist class with respect to the means of production, and to all material values of decisive importance, and thus reduces the formal rights of the workers to mere fiction, the Soviet State first creates the premises for these rights by actually securing the liberty of the workers' press, by rendering the functions of the workers&rsquo; organizations possible, etc.</p>

<p class="sm1">For the first time in history the Proletarian Democracy realizes the equality of all citizens without difference of sex, race, religion, and nationality, &ndash; an equality which has never been realized in a capitalist state.</p>

<p class="sm1">The Proletarian Democracy and its organs which realize the broadest democracy amongst the workers, are in incomparably closer relations with the masses, and enable them to take part in the administrative process. The right to elect new delegates, the right to recall them, the combination of executive and legislative power, the arrangement of electoral districts not according to territorial, but according to economic principles, (according to factories, undertakings, etc.) &ndash; all this draws an abrupt line between the Bourgeois Parliamentary Republic and the Soviet Dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>

<p class="sm1">The proletariat, as leader and vanguard of all other workers, and above all of the masses of the peasantry, secures its leading role by legal privileges, which are unavoidable in the first stages of development. These privileges must gradually die out in proportion to the progress of the education received by the rest of the working masses, and later by the rest of the citizens of the state, on the basis of the new relations.</p>

<h4>C. Expropriatlon of the Expropriators and Abolition of the Bourgeois Monopoly of the Means of Production</h4>

<p class="sm1">&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="sm1">The victorious proletariat utilizes the power which it has seized, first, to break the resistance of the enemy and to guard the continued rule of the working class against the attacks of the bourgeoisie, and secondly, it utilizes this concentrated power for the expropriation of the expropriators, that is, for the revolutionary transformation of the economic, and consequently of all other social relations. As a rule this expropriation will assume the form of confiscation, that is, by the expropriation of the means of production without compensation, and the delivery of these means into the hands of the Proletarian State.</p>

<p class="sm1">In this regard the CI. proposes the following fundamental measures:</p>

<ol>
<li class="sm1">The expropriation of the large industrial undertakings, of the means of transport and traffic (telegraph, telephone), electric works, etc.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li class="sm1">The proletarian nationalization of large landed estates, which are to be given over to the administration of the organs of the proletarian dictatorship; one part of the landed estates, especially that part being worked by the peasantry under lease, to be handed over to the peasantry. The extent of the ground area to be delivered up to the peasantry is determined by economic expediency, and by the necessity of neutralizing the peasantry, that is, by the social-political importance of the peasantry.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li class="sm1">Proletarian neutralization of the banks. Delivery of all gold reserves, securities, etc., into the hands of the Proletarian State. Security of the interests of small depositors, centralization of the banks, subordination of all large banking concerns to the Central Stale Bank of the republic.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li class="sm1">Nationalization and municipalization (communalization) of wholesale trade.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li class="sm1">Annulment (cancelation) of state debts.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li class="sm1">Monopoly of foreign trade.</li>

<li class="sm1">Monopolization of the most important printing establishments and newspapers.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li class="sm1">In the execution of these measures, the following principles are to be observed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Nationalization should as a rule not be extended to small and medium properties. The first reason for this is that the proletariat which has seized power has not the required number of organizing forces at its disposal, especially during the first days of the dictatorship, to enable it not only to destroy the old order, but to bring about a union of the small and medium units of production. The second reason is that the proletariat should not provoke the intermediate groups against it. The victorious proletariat must find the right course of action to be adopted towards those spheres of production which can be subjected to centralized and systematic management, and those which would only be cumbersome ballast.<br />
The latter must be left to private initiative.</p>

<p class="quote">The transition from Capitalism to Socialism cannot be carried out at one stroke. For this reason externally capitalistic forms and methods of administration and organization, as individual stimulation to work, piece work, bonus systems, calculation in money, capitalist forms of accounting and book-keeping, etc., are thus not only permissible during the preliminary period, but unavoidably necessary. The proletariat must devote particularly careful attention and the utmost precaution with regard to reciprocal relations between city and country, and set up no barriers to the individualistic working motives of the peasantry.</p>
