<p class="fst">In a certain Utopian romance by A. Bogdanov, called the &#8220;Red Star&#8221;&#8212;a book that was at one time eagerly devoured by party workers there is a chapter entitled: &#8220;The Era of Great Works.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The scene takes place on Mars, where a Russian Bolshevik, a child of the Russian revolution, happens to have fallen.
</p>
<p>
A great agricultural crisis has called forth the necessity of unprecedented work in the digging of canals. &#8220;The Era of Works&#8221; sets in. Hundreds of thousands of men are sent to work. And, when it is accomplished, it becomes the technical foundation of the new society.
</p>
<p>
I recalled all this whilst listening to comrade Krijanovsky&#8217;s report at the Congress of Soviets in December. The surroundings were unusual. The vast hall of the Grand Theatre was packed with workers and peasants&#8212;a great assembly of the toiling masses. On the platform stood, not a political leader, not an engineer; and although an old and worthy party comrade, he is not a politician.
</p>
<p>
Behind the platform is a great map of Soviet Russia, dotted over with many-coloured lamps, which light up one after another as the engineer enumerates the new electric stations that we are hoping to build.
</p>
<p>
The speech, too, is unusual for our congress. Not a single word about politics; but there is, instead, the appeal of labour, the appeal of the &#8220;Great works.&#8221; Poor, starving, and sheep-skinned Russia&#8212;Russia of primitive lighting and a crust of black bread&#8212;is going to be covered by a network of electric stations. The electric current will mysteriously set our factories and mills in motion; they will move freight and passengers by railway and waterway; they will drive the tractors and the ploughs along earth that but yesterday was worked by the primitive horse plough; they will illuminate our buildings; they will transform Russia into an economic whole, and the dismembered nation into an intelligent and organised section of humanity. The horizon is endless and beautiful.
</p>
<p>
And all this is not taking place on Mars; nor is it a Utopian romance. It has all been calculated and verified dozens of times. We <em>can</em> do it.
</p>
<p>
The thousands of comrades listen with strained attention to catch the whole of the report&#8212;a report which lasts over two hours. One feels the first movements of the new spirit&#8212;the spirit of the &#8220;Great Works&#8221;&#8212;in the hall, quivering on invisible wings.
</p>
<p>
When a &#8220;group of usurpers&#8221; declared, through Lenin, at the beginning of the war, that the civil war was coming, they were considered irresponsible babblers.
</p>
<p>
When that &#8220;group,&#8221; carried forward by the wave of revolution, took the helm of government into its hands, its ruin was every day foretold.
</p>
<p>
Today that &#8220;group,&#8221; now a tremendous force, affirms there is coming an order such as mankind has not yet seen. We shall build this order; and in its name we are beginning the &#8220;Era of Great Works&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
You millions of builders of the future fraternal society, do you not feel the warm blood of that future coursing already through your veins?
