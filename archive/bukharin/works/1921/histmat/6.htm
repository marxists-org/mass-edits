    <H4>a. Connection between the Various Social Phenomena; Formulation of the
    Question</H4>
    
    <P>In our discussion of the equilibrium between society and nature, we
      found that this equilibrium is being constantly disturbed and constantly
      reestablished, that there it is subject to contradictions which are
      constantly overcome and then set up anew, and then again overcome, and
      that this constitutes the fundamental course of social evolution or social
      decline. W e must therefore give some attention to this &quot;internal
      life&quot; of society.</P>
    
    <P>In discussions as to the relative standard of social evolution, we often
      hear such judgments as: &quot;the degree of social evolution is determined
      by the quantity of soap used&quot;; others measure the stage of this
      advance by the extent of the ability to read and write; still others, by
      the number of newspapers; a fourth group, by the state of technical
      progress; a fifth group, by the stage of development of the sciences, etc.
      A German professor (Schulze-Gaevernitz; see his book <I>Volkswirtschaftliche
      Studien aus Russland</I>) has advanced the proposition that the
      stage of civilization is best indicated by the manner of constructing
      toilet conveniences. We find that beginning with the latter and rising to
      the most sublime products of the human mind, everything has been used as a
      standard by which to measure the stage of social development.</P>
    
    <P>Where is the truth? Whose yardstick is the true yardstick? Why have
      there been so many different answers to this single question?</P>
    
    <P>A consideration of all the above answers will show that each of them is
      more or less correct. Does not the use of soap increase with the growth of
      &quot;culture and civilization&quot;? It does; so does the number of
      newspapers, or the social technology, or science. At any given time, the
      social phenomena of the period are always related with each other; just
      what this relation is, is another question, which we shall discuss very
      soon. But that there is such a relation no one can doubt; that is why all
      of the above answers are right. Just as the age of a man may be
      approximately determined on the basis of the structure and hardness of his
      bones, or on the appearance of his face (his color, wrinkles, growth of
      hair, etc.), or his mode of thought, or his mode of linguistic expression,
      so we may also judge the stage of growth of society on the basis of a
      number of indications, for all these indications are connected with other
      indications, and with still others, etc. If we stand face to face with
      beautiful products of art, or complicated systems of science, we rightly
      declare that these things could not be produced except in a highly
      developed society. We should make the same remark in the presence of a
      rich and complicated technology, and our remark would be just as correct.
      The fact that the most varied social phenomena are connected, are mutually
      conditioned, is almost self-evident. A series of simple questions will
      convince the reader immediately. Was futurist poetry possible, for
      example, a century ago? No, it was not. Could Eskimos living on the ice
      have invented wireless telegraphy? Is it possible for present-day science
      to predict man's fate from the stars? Could Marxism have originated in the
      Middle Ages? It is obvious that all these things are impossible. Futurism
      could not have appeared one hundred years ago, because life was then
      calmer and quieter; futurism grew up in pavemented cities, with their
      noise and racket, their nervous exhaustion, in the militaristic turmoil of
      a dissolving bourgeois civilization. This poetry of the brazen blare could
      no more have grown up one hundred years ago than ivy could grow on a
      recently tarred roof. Eskimos living on the ice could not have invented
      the wireless telegraph, for they cannot even handle an ordinary telegraph
      instrument. Present-day science does not occupy itself with such
      idiosyncrasies as reading the stars, because science at its present level
      despises these things. Marxism could not have begun in the Middle Ages,
      because the proletariat was not yet in existence, and therefore there was
      no soil in which the Marxist theory could grow. Now we have a highly
      developed technology, a proletariat, a great number of newspapers,
      advertising on a tremendous scale, trusts, futurism, aeroplanes, the
      electron theory, Mr. Rockefeller's dividends, strikes of coal-miners; the
      Communist Party, the League of Nations, the Third International,
      electrification projects, armies consisting of millions, Lloyd George,
      Lenin, etc.; and all these things are manifestations o£ the same
      period, the same epoch, just as we may also regard as manifestations of
      another epoch (the Middle Ages) all of the following: the power of the
      Popes at Rome, a comparatively low level of technology, compulsory labor
      of peasant serfs, science in the hands of priests (scholastic philosophy),
      the search for the philosopher's stone (which would turn base metals into
      gold, etc.), the inquisition, poor roads, illiteracy even among kings,
      village-commons, witches, trade guilds, dog Latin (spoken and written by
      scholars), robber knights, etc. Lenin, Lloyd George, Krupp, these have no
      place in the Middle Ages. And, on the other hand, we do not expect to find
      on the Red Square in Moscow, a medieval tournament with knights doing each
      other to death for the favor of a lady's smile. &quot;Other times, other
      songbirds; other songbirds, other songs.&quot; There is no doubt of the
      general connection between social phenomena, of the &quot;adaptation&quot;
      of certain social phenomena to others, in other words, of the existence of
      a certain equilibrium within society between its elements, its component
      parts, between the various forms of social phenomena.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Auguste Comte already stated that the various phases of
      social life are always adapted to each other at any period (the so called
      <I>consensus). </I>Müller-Lyer (<I>Phasen der Kultur, </I>München,
      p.344) states this even more clearly: &quot;Any sociological function, any
      cultural phenomenon, for instance, art, science, manners, economy, state
      organization, freedom of the individual, philosophy; the social position
      of woman, etc., down to the use of soap, and the like, may be taken as the
      measure of the cultural level. And, if all the cultural phenomena should
      develop parallel to each other and at the same rate, it would not matter
      which of these criteria should be applied.&quot; One of the latest writers
      of the hard-pressed German bourgeoisie, Oswald Spengler (<I>Der Untergang
      des Abendlandes, </I>München, 1920, vol. i, p.8), writes: &quot;How
      many people know that there is a profound relation in form between the
      differential calculus and the dynastic state principle of the epoch of
      Louis XIV, between the ancient state form of the polis (in Greece) and
      Euclidean Geometry, between the perspective drawing of western painting
      and the conquest of space by railroads, telephones, and long-range guns,
      between contrapuntal instrumentation in music and the economic credit
      system?&quot; Spengler's formulation may be disputed, but there is no
      doubt of the correctness of his thought: that the most varied social
      phenomena are interrelated.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><A NAME="b"></A></P>
    
    <H4>b. Things, Persons, Ideas</H4>
    
    <P>We defined society above as an aggregation of persons. In the broader
      sense, however, society also includes things. Present-day society, for
      instance, with its vast stone cities, its giant structures, its railroads,
      harbors, machines, houses, etc.; all these things are material technical &quot;organs&quot;
      of society. Any specific machine will at once Lose its significance as a
      machine outside of human society; it becomes merely a portion of external
      nature, a combination of pieces of steel, wood, etc. When a great liner
      sinks to the bottom, this living monster with its powerful engines that
      cause the whole marvelous structure of steel to vibrate, with its
      thousands of appliances of every possible kind, from dish-rags to wireless
      station, now lies at the bottom of the sea and the whole mechanism loses
      its social significance. Barnacles will attach themselves to its body, its
      wood constructions will rot in the water, crabs and other animals will
      live in the cabins, but the steamer ceases to be a steamer; having lost
      its <I>social </I>existence, it is excluded from society, has ceased to
      be a portion of society, to perform its social service, and is now merely
      an object - no longer a <I>social </I>object - like any other part of
      external nature which does not come in direct contact with human society.
      Technical devices are not merely pieces of external nature: they are
      extensions of society's organs; we may therefore take a broader view of
      society than we have thus far done; we may make it include also things,
      i.e., society's technical apparatus, its system of working devices.
      Strictly speaking, not all things are included among the means of
      production; some may even have a very remote relation with this
      production, aside from the fact that they themselves constitute products
      of material production: for example, books, maps, diagrams, museums,
      picture galleries, libraries, astronomical observatories, meteorological
      stations (we always speak of their &quot;physical equipment&quot;),
      laboratories, measuring instruments, telescopes and microscopes of every
      kind, test-tubes, retorts, etc. All these things are not directly
      connected with the process of material production and consequently are not
      a part of social technology, may not be considered among the material
      productive forces; nevertheless, everyone knows their function; they are
      not merely sections of external nature; they also have their &quot;social
      existence&quot;; they also must be included under our concept of society
      in its broader application.</P>
    
    <P>We have seen in chapter iv that society constitutes a system of <I>persons
      </I>considered together; now we see that <I>things</I> must also be so
      considered. But, in the narrower sense of the word, we understand by &quot;society&quot;
      not merely the aggregate of persons involved, but the connected system. We
      first regarded these persons as material bodies at work. Society
      therefore, as we have explained, is above all a working organization, a
      <I>human </I>working apparatus. But we know very well that human beings
      are not merely physical bodies, they think, feel, wish, pursue goals and
      are constantly changing in their thoughts and desires. The relations
      between persons are not only material working relations, but also
      psychical relations, &quot;mental&quot; relations; society produces not
      only material objects: it also produces the so called &quot;cultural
      values&quot;: art, science, etc.; in other words, it produces <I>ideas
      </I>in addition to things. These ideas, once they have been produced, may
      be developed into large <I>systems of ideas</I>.</P>
    
    <P>The trinity of elements in society therefore includes: things, persons,
      ideas. We must by no means assume that these are independent elements: it
      is, of course, clear that if there were no people there would be no ideas,
      that ideas exist only in people and do not swim about in space like oil on
      the surface of water. But this does not prevent us from distinguishing
      these three elements; it is likewise clear that there must be a certain
      equilibrium between the three elements. Roughly speaking: society could
      not exist, unless the system of things, the system of persons, and the
      system of ideas were adapted each to the other. We shall have to go into
      this more in detail; we shall then understand the relation between
      phenomena that is so manifest on the surface, and concerning which we
      spoke in the preceding paragraph.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="c"></A></P>
    
    <H4>c. Social Technology and the Economic Structure of Society</H4>
    
    <P>We have already pointed out that in a consideration of social phenomena
      it is necessary to begin with the social, material productive forces, with
      the social technology, the system of tools of labor. We may now supplement
      these remarks. In speaking of the social technology, we of course meant
      not a certain tool, or the aggregate of different tools, but the whole
      <I>system </I>of these tools in society. We must imagine that in a given
      society, in various places, but in a <I>certain order</I>, there are
      distributed looms and motors, instruments and apparatus, simple and
      complicated tools. In some places they are crowded close together (for
      instance, in the great industrial centers), in other places, <I>other
      </I>tools are <I>scattered. </I>But at any given moment, if people are
      connected by a labor relation, if we have a society, all these instruments
      of production-tools and machines, large and small, simple and complicated,
      manual or power-driven-are united into a single system. (Of course, a
      certain <I>type </I>of tool is always predominant: at the present time
      this is the type of machines and mechanisms, while formerly it was that of
      hand tools; the significance of apparatus and self-acting machinery is
      increasing more and more.) In other words, we may consider the social
      technology as a whole, in which each of the parts at a given moment is
      socially necessary (inevitable). Why may it be so considered? Wherein lies
      the unity of all the parts of the technical system of society?</P>
    
    <P>In order to grasp this matter fully, let us suppose that on a certain
      day - let us say, in modern Germany, all the machines serving the purposes
      of coal mining should miraculously ascend to heaven. The result would be a
      cessation of practically the entire industrial life. It would be
      impossible to obtain fuel for factories and shops; all the machines and
      instruments in these factories would stop working, <I>i.e., </I>would be
      eliminated from the process of production. The technology of one branch
      would thus influence practically all the other branches. As a matter of
      fact, the various branches of production constitute a whole, not only in
      our thoughts, but objectively, in reality; they make up a single social
      technology. The social technology, we reiterate, is not therefore a mere
      aggregate of the various instruments of labor, but is their connecting
      system. On any individual part of this system depends all the rest of the
      system. At any given moment, also, the various parts of this technology
      are related in a certain proportion, a certain quantitative relation. If,
      in a certain factory, we must have a certain number of spindles and a
      certain number of workers to provide material for a certain number of
      looms, the more or less normal progress of social production throughout
      society will also involve the presence of a certain definite relation 
      between the number of blast furnaces and the number of machines and
      mechanical tools in metallurgy, as well as in the textile industry, the
      chemical industry, or any other industry. To he sure, this relation may
      not be precisely <I>fixed, </I>as in a single factory; but between the &quot;technological
      systems&quot; of the various branches of production there does exist a
      certain necessary relation, which may in unorganized society be the result
      of a blind natural process, while in organized society it is the result of
      a conscious process; but it exists in all society. It is inconceivable,
      for instance, that a factory should have ten times as many spindles as it
      needs; it is likewise inconceivable that ten times as much coal should be
      mined as is needed, and that the machines and appliances used in mining
      coal should be ten times as numerous as is required in order to supply the
      other branches of production. Thus, as there is a definite relation and a
      definite proportion between the various branches of production; there is
      also in social technology a certain definite relation between its parts as
      well as a definite prevailing proportion. This circumstance changes the
      mere aggregate of tools, machines, instruments, etc., into a system of
      social technology.</P>
    
    <P>This being the case, it is also clear that each given system of social
      technology also determines the system of labor relations between persons.</P>
    
    <P>Is it conceivable, for instance, that the technological system of
      society, the structure of its tools, should be along certain lines, while
      the structure of human relations should be along entirely different lines?
      More concretely: is it possible that the technological system of society
      should be based on machines, while the productive relation, the actual
      labor relation, should be based on petty industry working with hand tools?
      Of course, this is an impossibility; wherever a society exists, there must
      be a certain equilibrium between its technology and its economy, <I>i.e.,
      </I>between the totality of its instruments of labor and its working
      organization, between its material productive devices and its material
      human labor system.</P>
    
    <P>Let us explain by means of an example, namely, by means of a comparison
      between so called &quot;ancient society&quot; and present-day capitalist
      society; let us begin with technology. Albert Neuburger,<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP>
      who is inclined more to exaggerate than belittle the accomplishments of
      ancient technology, says: &quot;Aristotle in his <I>Problems of Mechanics
      </I>enumerates for us the auxiliary mechanical devices made use of in
      ancient times. They include only the following: the draw-well (lever with
      counter-weight), the equal-armed balance, the unequal-armed, or Roman
      balance (steelyard), the tongs, the wedge, the axe, the windlass, the
      cylindrical roller, the wagon-wheel, the shaft, the pulley, the sling, the
      rudder, the potter's wheel, as well as revolving wheels of copper or iron
      with different directions of revolution, which very probably are
      equivalent to our toothed wheels (gear-wheels).&quot;</P>
    
    <P>These are the most rudimentary technical appliances, otherwise known as &quot;simple
      machines&quot; (lever, inclined plane, tongs, rollers). It is obvious that
      not much advance was possible with such devices, which were used chiefly
      in the working of metals. It is clear that only the metallic skeleton of
      the productive forces constitutes the first permanent basis for their
      development. Yet, of the metals worked, gold was the most important; the
      greater quantity of metal was used for the manufacture of objects intended
      for non-productive consumption. The sole exception is blacksmith work, by
      means of which rather primitive tools were produced with the aid of
      hammer, anvil, tongs, file, vise, and other comparatively simple
      instruments (producing principally axes, hammers, hoes, horseshoes, nails,
      chains, pitchforks, shovels, spoons, etc.); the casting of metals stood
      chiefly in the service of turning out statues and other non-productive
      objects. It is therefore not surprising to learn that Vitruvius defines a
      &quot;machine&quot; as a &quot;device made of wood&quot;.</P>
    
    <P>&quot;For whole centuries technology stood still,&quot; says Salvioli,<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#2" NAME="2b">2)</A></SUP>
      of course not meaning an absolute stagnation, but an extremely slow
      development of ancient technology.</P>
    
    <P>These technical devices naturally also determined the <I>type of
      worker, </I>the degree of his skill, and also the working relations, the
      productive conditions.</P>
    
    <P>There could only be one type of worker under such a technology: a hand
      worker, a petty artisan. Blacksmiths, carpenters, masons, weavers,
      goldsmiths, miners, wagon-builders, saddlers, harness-makers,
      lathe-workers, silversmiths, potters, dyers, tanners, glassmakers,
      locksmiths, etc., etc., such are the types of productive workers.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#3" NAME="3b">3)</A></SUP>
      Thus, the social technology conditioned the character of the living
      working machinery, i.e., the type of worker, his labor &quot;skill&quot;.
      But this technology also conditioned the relation between the persons at
      work. As a matter of fact, because we see here enumerated a number of
      types of workers, it is plain that we are dealing with a division of
      production into a number of branches, each one of which produces only a
      single type of worker. This is called the <I>division of labor</I>.</P>
    
    <P>The cause of this division of labor was the existence of corresponding
      labor tools. But this division of labor was of a peculiar kind: &quot;The
      division of labor could not here lead to the results which it has had in
      modern societies, for in ancient times this division was not a function of
      the machine process. It was not an outgrowth of a system of great
      factories (<I>de grandes usines</I>), but of petty and medium-sized
      industry.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#4" NAME="4b">4)</A></SUP> &quot;Large-scale
      production was foreign to the ancient world, which never advanced beyond
      the stage of petty artisanry.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#5" NAME="5b">5)</A></SUP>
      Here is a different form of productive labor conditions, also based, as we
      have seen, on the system of technology. Even when we learn of great
      structures being raised, we must remember that they were often
      accomplished by means of petty labor. Thus, in the case of the
      construction of one of the great aqueducts at Rome, the government signed
      a contract with three thousand master masons; these worked together with
      their slaves. And in cases where production was on a comparatively large
      scale, it could, under the prevailing system of technology, exist only by
      making use of forces lying outside the economic system: for instance,
      slave labor, whole armies of slaves being imported after the conclusion of
      victorious wars, who were sold and distributed to the great estates and
      the slave-operated factories (<I>ergastula</I>). Under a different system
      of technology, slave labor would have been impossible: the slaves spoil
      delicate machinery, and slave labor does not pay. Thus, even such a
      phenomenon as the labor of imported slaves can be explained, under the
      given historical conditions, by the tools with which social labor works.
      Or, to take another example: we know that, in spite of the rather high
      development of commercial-capitalist conditions in ancient times, the
      economy of that period was on .the whole a natural economy (payments in
      commodities, in <I>kind, </I>rather than in money). People were not in
      close economic relations; the exchange of commodities was much less
      developed than in our day; great quantities of products were turned out in
      the great estates (<I>latifundia</I>) and in jail-like shops, for their
      own consumption. This is also a definite stage of labor, a form of
      productive relation, and again the explanation is evident: it can be
      explained on the basis of the low development of the productive forces,
      the weakness of technology. Under such a technical system, it was
      difficult to attain a great excess production. In a word, it is evident
      that the relations between people in the labor process are determined by
      the stage of advance in the evolution of technology; the ancient economy
      was, as it were, <I>adapted to </I>the ancient technology.</P>
    
    <P>Let us compare this condition with that under capitalist society. Taking
      up, in the first place, the matter of technology, it is sufficient to cast
      a glance over a list of some of the branches of production. Let us
      consider only two of the groups of capitalist industry: the construction
      of machinery, instruments and apparatus, as one branch, and the
      electro-technical industry, as another branch. Here is the picture that
      presents itself:</P>

    <P>It is sufficient to compare this list with the &quot;machines&quot;
      spoken of by Aristotle or Vitruvius, to understand the tremendous
      difference between the technology of ancient society and that of modern
      capitalist society. Just as the ancient technology determined the ancient
      form of economy, so capitalist technology determines the present-day
      capitalist economy. If we could enumerate the entire population, let us
      say, of ancient Rome and of present-day Berlin or London, and divide these
      populations into trades, by their actual occupations, the profound gulf
      that separates us from ancient times would become apparent. We now have
      (as a result of our machine technology) types of workers that never
      existed in ancient times. Instead of the petty artisans (for instance, the
      <I>fabri ferrarii</I>),<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#7" NAME="7b">7)</A></SUP>
      we now- find, in our society, electricians, machinists, machine
      constructors, boiler-makers, engine-lathe workers, frazers, optical
      instrument makers, compositors, lithographers, railroad workers,
      locomotive engineers, firemen, steam-hammer attendants, harvesting
      machinery workers, mowing machinery workers, sheaf-binding machinery
      workers, tractor repairers, electrical engineers, chemists, specialists on
      steam-boilers, linotypers, etc., etc. These types of workers did not exist
      even in name, for no corresponding branch of production, and consequently
      no appropriate tools of labor, existed in this field in ancient times. But
      even if we take up those species of workers whose names are still the same
      and who existed in earlier days, we shall find that there is again a great
      difference. For instance, what is there in common between the present-day
      weaver who works in a great textile factory and the artisan or slave
      weaver in ancient Greece or Rome? The latter would feel as much out of
      place in a modern factory as would Julius Caesar in a New York subway
      train. We have <I>different </I>labor forces, of <I>different </I>labor
      skill. Our labor forces are the product of a different technology, and
      they have become adapted to that technology.</P>
    
    <P>The existence of a great number of industrial branches which were not
      present in earlier times results chiefly in the fact that the division of
      labor today is entirely different. But the division of labor constitutes
      one of the fundamental conditions of production. The modern division of
      labor is determined by the modern instruments of labor, by the character,
      description, and combination of machines and tools, <I>i.e., </I>by the
      technical apparatus of capitalist society. The typical form of a modern
      industrial establishment is that of the large factory. We no longer have
      the small production unit, the artisan industry, nor even the domestic
      industry of the <I>latifundium </I>owner; we have instead a gigantic
      organization embracing thousands of persons, distributed to their various
      posts in a definite order, and performing their allotted tasks. If, as an
      example of a capitalist enterprise, we take Mr. Ford's automobile factory
      in Detroit; its emphatically modern character is the first trait to strike
      the eye: a precise division of labor, much machinery, operating
      automatically under the supervision of the workers, the strict adherence
      to a correct succession of operations, etc. Parts of the product are
      carried along by slowly moving belts or platforms, and the various types
      of workers at their machines execute their specific tasks on the partly
      finished articles as they go by. The entire labor process has been
      calculated down to the second. Each displacement of the worker, each
      motion of hand or foot, each inclination of the body, all have been
      foreseen. The &quot;staff&quot; supervises the general course of the work;
      everything goes by the clock, or rather, the chronometer. Such is the
      division of labor and its &quot;scientific efficiency&quot; according to
      the Taylor system. Such a factory, if we consider its human structure,
      i.e., the relations between the individuals composing it, also constitutes
      a productive relation, in which the distribution of persons and their
      relation with each other are determined by the system of machinery, the
      combinations of machines, the technology, the organization of the factory
      inventory.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>&quot;The present development of technology must be
      considered as the dominating factor in the organization of labor </I>&quot;.
      The machine does not stand alone in the factory; all the machines are
      arranged in groups; they are related to each other or connected in their
      operations. The transfer of a job from one machine to another . . in the
      eyes of the technical supervisor, is a calculable quantity. The labor
      plan, the distribution of location in labor, transportation, are likewise
      precisely regulated, made automatic, standardized . . . and gradually
      changed into a precisely calculated mechanism of operative administration.
      . . In the general system of this <I>movement of things, </I>the <I>movement
      of man turned out </I>(also his <I>influence </I>on others) . . often to
      be a determining oasis . . . there arose a system of scientific movement&quot;
      (A. Gastev: <I>Our Tasks - Labor Organization, </I>in the <I>Annual of
      the Labor Institute, No. </I>t, Moscow, 1921, pp.12, 13, in Russian). An
      idea of the many branches of work in the great metal factories will be
      given by the branches found in Russian factories: mechanical, electrical,
      blacksmith, boiler, molding, casting steel, iron foundry, iron rolling,
      heating metals, Martin blast furnaces, Siemens ovens, crucibles,
      carriages, chemical treatment of wood, construction work, auxiliary
      operations. The following categories of workers were found in the Putilov
      Works in 1914-1916: locksmiths, lathe-workers, milling machine workers,
      planers, chiselers, borers, welders, stampers, ussemblers, blacksmiths,
      hammerers, pressers, pointers, stokers, furnace foremen, rollers,
      machinists, cutters, potters, molders, smelting furnace workers, paperers,
      joiners, carpenters, painters, tinsmiths, plumbers, cable workers,
      unskilled workers, men and women (c<I>f. Metal Workers' Gazette, </I>St.
      Petersburg, 1917, p.13, in Russian). Many of the names of these
      occupations show that they are bound to a specific instrument, tool, or
      machine. <I>In a certain combination of these working onstrumerits, in
      their distribution in the plant, a certain distribution. of men is also
      involved, the latter being determined by the former</I>.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Precisely as the production relations in ancient Greece or Rome were an
      outgrowth of the system of technology characteristic of petty and medium
      production, so the conditions of large-scale production in modern times
      are a result of the modern technology. Here again, there is a relative
      equilibrium between the social technology and the social economy.</P>
    
    <P>We have above observed that the poor technology of ancient times
      resulted in a poor exchange process, and that the economy remained for the
      most part economy <I>in kind</I>: the relation between the economies was
      very loose; such were the definite production relations of antiquity. But
      modern capitalist technology permits the sending forth of huge quantities
      of products. The division of labor also has its influence in causing the
      entire production to be made for the market. For the manufacturer does not
      himself wear the millions of pairs of suspenders turned out by his
      factory. Therefore, the production conditions of the commodities economy
      are also a consequence of the technology of our day.</P>
    
    <P>We have approached the question from four different angles: first, the
      nature of the labor forces; second, the distribution of labor between
      them; third, the extent of production, i.e., of the organization of
      individuals in the various economies; fourth, the relations between these
      various economies; and in every case we have seen from the example of the
      two different societies chosen (the ancient and the modern) that the <I>combinations
      of the instruments of labor (the social technology) are the deciding
      factor in the combinations and relations of men, </I>i.e<I>. in social
      economy</I>. But there is another phase of the production relations,
      namely, the question of the social classes, which is to be discussed later
      in detail; let us consider this question now from the standpoint of the
      production relations.</P>
    
    <P>In considering the relations of men in the production process, we
      observe everywhere (except in the so called primitive communism) that the
      groupings of men are not accomplished in such manner as to cause the
      various groups to lie in a horizontal line, but rather in a vertical line.
      For example, in the conditions of medieval serfdom, we find at the top the
      owners of the estates, under them the administrators, mayors, supervisors,
      and at the bottom the peasants. In capitalist production relations we find
      that men are not only distributed among molders, machinists, railroad
      workers, tobacco workers, etc., all of whom - in spite of the great
      differences between their tasks - are working along the same
      lines-occupying the same relative station in production; but we find that
      here too a number of persons stand above the others in the labor process:
      above the workers are the &quot;salaried employees&quot; (the medium-grade
      technical staff: master mechanics, engineers, specialists, agricultural
      experts, etc.); above these &quot;salaried men&quot; stand the higher
      officials (superintendents, directors); above them are the so called
      owners of enterprises, capitalists, the commanders-in-chief and
      controllers of the destinies of the production process. Let us also
      consider the <I>latifundium</I> of a rich Roman landlord. Here again we
      find a regular gradation of persons; on the lowest rung of the ladder are
      the slaves (&quot;the speaking instruments&quot;, <I>instrumenta vocalia</I>,
      as the Romans termed them, as distinguished from the &quot;semi-speaking
      instruments&quot;, <I>instrumenta semi-vocalia</I>, namely, bleating
      cattle, and the &quot;mute instruments&quot;, <I>instrumenta muta</I>,
      inanimate objects); above the slaves stand the slave drivers, overseers,
      etc.; then come the superintendents; finally we have the owner of the <I>latifundium</I>
      himself, with his honored family (his wife usually had charge of certain
      domestic operations). A blind man can see that we are dealing with
      differently constituted relations between persons at work. All the persons
      enumerated participate in one way or another in the labor process and
      therefore have certain definite relations to each other. In classifying
      them, we may divide them according to their trades and callings; but we
      may also divide them according to their classes. If our division is on the
      basis of occupations or callings, we shall have blacksmiths, locksmiths,
      lathe-workers, etc. In the higher class, chemists, mechanics,
      boiler-engineers, textile experts, locomotive specialists, etc. It is
      obvious that the locksmiths, lathe-workers, machine-workers, stevedores,
      are in one class, while the engineer, the specialist, etc., are in another
      class; the capitalist, who has control of all, is again in another class.
      These persons cannot all be thrown into the same pot. In spite of the
      division between the work performed by the locksmith, the turner and the
      compositor, they all stand in the same relation to each other in the
      general labor process. Quite different is the relation between locksmith
      and engineer, or between locksmith and capitalist. Furthermore, the
      locksmith, turner, linotyper, individually and as a body, are in the same
      relation to all the engineers and in the same remoter relation to all
      superintendents, &quot;captains of industry&quot;, capitalists. The
      greatest differences here are in the productive function, in the
      productive significance, in the character of the relations between men;
      the capitalist in his factory distributes and arranges his workers as he
      might things or tools; but the workers do not &quot;distribute&quot; the
      capitalists (under the capitalist system of society); they &quot;are
      distributed&quot; by these capitalists. This is a relation of &quot;master
      and servant&quot;, as Marx says, with &quot;capital in command&quot;. It
      is their different function in the production process that constitutes the
      basis for the division of men into different social classes.</P>
    
    <P>An important point to be noted here is the nature of the relation
      between the process of production and that of distribution, since we have
      seen that the latter is, so to speak, the reverse side of the social
      process of production. Concerning this subject of the process of
      distribution, Marx says the following: &quot;In the most shallow
      conception of distribution, the latter appears as a distribution of
      products and to that extent as further removed from and quasi-independent
      of production. But before distribution means distribution of products, it
      is, first a distribution of the means of production, and, second, what is
      practically another wording of the same fact, it is a distribution of the
      members of society among the various kinds of production (the subjection
      of individuals to certain conditions of production). The distribution of
      products is manifestly a result of this distribution, which is bound up
      with the process of production and determines the very organization of the
      latter. To treat of production apart from the distribution which is
      comprised in it, is plainly an idle abstraction. Conversely, we know the
      character of the distribution of products the moment we are given the
      nature of that other distribution which forms originally a factor of
      production&quot; (<I>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy,
      </I>Chicago, 1913, p.286).</P>
    
    <P>These sentences of Marx deserve more of our attention.</P>
    
    <P>We find, first of all, that the process of the production of products
      determines the process of the distribution of products. If, for example,
      production is carried on in independent establishments (by various
      capitalist enterprises, or by individual artisans), each establishment no,
      longer producing all of its requirements, but turning out some special
      product (watches, grain, iron locks, hammers, tongs, etc., as the case may
      be), it is obvious that the distribution of the product will take the form
      of exchange. Persons producing locks cannot clothe themselves in such
      locks or consume them for dinner, nor can persons producing grain lock
      their barns with grain; they must have locks and keys for this purpose.
      The manner of production which is followed also determines the manner of
      distributing the product; this distribution may not be considered as
      independent of production. On the contrary, it is determined <I>by </I>production
      and, together with it, constitutes a section of <I>material social
      reproduction</I>.</P>
    
    <P>But production itself involves two further &quot;distributions&quot;:
      first, the distribution of persons, their arrangement in the production
      process, depending on their function, as already discussed; second, the
      distribution of production tools among these persons. These &quot;distributions&quot;
      are a part of production or, in the words of Marx, are &quot;involved&quot;
      in production. We have seen, for example, in one of the systems of society
      discussed, namely, capitalist society, that its &quot;distribution of
      persons&quot; also includes a division into classes, based on the
      difference of function in the productive process. But this varying &quot;distribution
      of persons&quot;, depending on their varying assignment in production is
      also connected with a distribution of the means of labor: The capitalist,
      the owner of the <I>latifundium, </I>and the estate owner control these
      means of labor (factory and machinery, the estate and the compulsory
      shops, the soil and structures), while the worker has no instruments of
      production aside from his own labor power; the slave does not even own his
      own body, nor does the peasant serf. It is therefore obvious that the
      varying function of classes in production is based on the distribution of
      instruments of production among them. In his review of Marx's book, A <I>Contribution
      to the Critique of Political Economy, </I>Engels says: a &quot;Economy
      deals not with things but with relations between persons and in the last
      analysis between classes; but these relations always are bound up with
      <I>things </I>and appear as <I>things</I>.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#8" NAME="8b">8)</A></SUP>
      For example, the current class relations in capitalist society, namely,
      the relations between capitalists and workers, are bound up with a <I>thing:
      </I>the instruments of production in the hands of the capitalists,
      controlled by the latter, not owned by the workers. These instruments of
      production serve the capitalists as tools for the obtaining of profits, as
      means of exploiting the working class. They are not mere things, they are
      things in a special social significance, in that they here serve not only
      as means of production, but also as a means of exploiting wage laborers.
      In other words, this <I>thing </I>expresses the relation between classes,
      or, in the words of Engels, these class relations are bound up with the
      <I>thing. </I>In the last analysis, this <I>thing, </I>in our example,
      <I>is capital</I>.</P>
    
    <P>The special form of production relations, therefore, existing in the
      relations between classes, is determined by the varying function of these
      groups of persons in the production process, and the distribution of the
      means of production among them. This fully conditions the distribution of
      the products.</P>
    
    <P>The capitalist obtains profit because he owns instruments of production:
      because he is a capitalist.</P>
    
    <P>The class relations in production, <I>i.e., </I>the relations bound up
      with the varying distribution of the means of production, are particularly
      important in society. It is they which determine in the first place the
      outline of society, its system or, in the words of Marx, its economic
      structure.</P>
    
    <P>Now, the production relations are extremely numerous, and varied. If we
      recall, furthermore, that we are considering the distribution of products
      as a portion of reproduction, it also becomes clear that the relations
      between persons in the process of distribution are also included in the
      production relations. In a complicated system of society there are
      innumerable such relations, such as, between merchants, bankers, clerks,
      brokers, tradesmen of all kinds, workers, consumers, salesmen, traveling
      salesmen, messengers, manufacturers, ship-owners, sailors, engineers,
      unskilled workers, etc., etc., which all constitute production relations.
      All are interwoven in the most varied combinations, the most peculiar
      patterns, the most unusual confusions. But the fundamental scheme of all
      these patterns is important; namely, the relations between the great
      groups known as social classes. The system of society will depend on the
      classes included in society, their mutual position, their functions in the
      production process, the distribution of instruments of labor. We have a
      capitalist society if the capitalist is on top; we have a slave system if
      the estate owner is on top, and in control of everything; we have a
      dictatorship of the proletariat if the workers are on top. To be sure,
      even the absence of all classes would not mean the disappearance of
      society, but merely the disappearance of class society. There were no
      classes, for example, in the primitive communist society, nor will there
      be any in the communist society of the future.</P>
    
    <P>We observed above that the production relations change with the social
      technology; a glance at the actual historical development of any society
      will be sufficient to show that this principle also holds good in such
      production relations as are simultaneously class relations. Great shifts
      of classes have taken place, for instance, before the eyes of the present
      generation. Not many decades ago, there was still a considerable class of
      independent artisans, which subsequently declined because of the growth of
      the machine technology, and, consequently of large-scale production, of
      the factory system. Simultaneously, the proletariat increased, as did also
      the industrial upper bourgeoisie, while the small artisan disappeared. The
      class alignment necessarily changed, for with the changes in technology
      there are also associated changes in the distribution of labor in society;
      certain functions in production disappear or fall into the background; new
      functions arise, etc., simultaneously, class groups are altered; in a
      society having a low stage of the productive forces, industry will not be
      highly developed, while the social economy will still be rural and
      agricultural in character. It will not surprise us to find the rural
      classes predominating in such a society, with the class of country squires
      standing at the head. On the other hand, in a society with highly
      developed productive forces, we shall find a mighty industry, cities,
      factories, villages, etc., with the urban classes attaining great
      influence. The landed proprietor yields place to the industrial
      bourgeoisie or other sections of the bourgeoisie; the proletariat becomes
      a great power.</P>
    
    <P>A constantly progressing realignment of classes may totally change the
      form of society. This will particularly be the case if the class at the
      bottom comes out on top, a process which is to be described in the
      following chapters. For the present we shall merely state that class
      relations also - the most important part of production relations - change
      with the changes in the productive forces. &quot;These social relations
      between the producers, and the conditions under which they exchange their
      activities and share in the total act of production, will naturally vary
      according to the character of the means of production. With the discovery
      of a new instrument of warfare, the firearm, the whole internal
      organization of the army was necessarily altered, the relations within
      which individuals compose an army and can work as an army were
      transformed, and the relation of different armies to one another was
      likewise changed. We thus see that the social <I>relations within which
      individuals produce, the </I>social <I>relations of production, are
      altered, transformed, with the change and development of the material
      means of production, of the forces of production&quot; </I>(Karl Marx:
      <I>Wage-Labor and Capital, </I>New York, Labor News Company, 1917, pp.35,
      36). In other words: &quot;The organization of any specific society is
      determined by the condition of its productive forces. With an alteration
      of this condition, the social organization also will necessarily change
      sooner or later. Social organization is therefore in unstable equilibrium
      <SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#9" NAME="9b">9)</A></SUP> at all points
      where the social forces of production are growing&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#10" NAME="10b">10)</A></SUP>
      (or falling, <I>N.B</I>.).</P>
    
    <P>The totality of the production relations, therefore, is the economic
      structure of society, or its mode of<I> production. </I>This is the human
      labor apparatus of society, its &quot;<I>real basis</I>&quot;.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">A consideration of the production relations will show
      that they depend on the manner in which the persons involved are
      distributed in space. The <I>relation is </I>expressed in the fact that
      each personas already shown, has his place as a screw in the mechanism of
      a watch. It is precisely this definite situation in space, in the &quot;theater
      of labor&quot; that makes of this arrangement, this distribution, a social
      relation of labor. No doubt, every object is situated in space, moves in
      space, but here men are joined, particularly, by the <I>definiteness </I>of
      their working positions, as it were. This is a material relation like that
      of the parts in the mechanism of a watch. We must not overlook the fact
      that the critics of historical materialism are constantly confusing terms
      because the word &quot;material&quot; has a number of meanings. Thus, the
      historical process, for instance, is traced back to material &quot;needs&quot;
      or &quot;interests&quot;, whereupon the refutation of historical
      materialism is proclaimed, since it has been rightly shown that &quot;interest&quot;
      is' not a material thing in the philosophical sense of the word, but
      obviously psychical. We admit that interest is not matter; but it is too
      bad that even certain &quot;advocates&quot; of <I>historical </I>materialism
      (who usually associate Marx with some bourgeois philosopher, since they
      are opposed to <I>philosophical </I>materialism) are guilty of such a
      confusion in terms. Max Adler, for instance, who weds Marx to Kant,
      regards society as a totality of psychical interactions; for him
      everything is psychical. Here is a specimen of this nature: &quot;A <I>relation
      is, </I>however, by no means `matter' in the sense of philosophical
      materialism, which puts matter on the same level with psychic substances.
      It is always difficult to find a relation between the `economic
      structure', `the material element' of historical materialism, and the
      `matter' of the former theory, no matter how this theory be understood . .
      . and what is true of the cause is also true of the effect. Instruments of
      production are rather products of the `human mind:&quot; (Max Zetterbaum:
      <I>Zur materialistischen Geschichtsauffassung </I>in <I>Die Neue Zeit,
      </I>Vol. 21, part ii, p.403. ) Zetterbaum is confused by the fact that
      machines are not made by soulless men. But as men themselves are not
      begotten by corpses, he considers everything in society to be a product of
      spirit without body - a very virtuous spirit therefore. It follows that
      the machine is psychical, and society has no &quot;matter&quot;. But is
      obvious that sinful flesh is somewhere involved, for even a sinless spirit
      could not beget men and machines. Furthermore, a fleshless spirit would
      not even desire to occupy himself with such affairs. What remains of the &quot;relation&quot;?
      We must again point out to Herr Zetterbaum that the solar system is a
      material system; that we call it a system because its parts (sun, earth,
      other planets) are in definite <I>relations </I>to each other, occupy a
      certain position in space at any given moment. Just as the totality of
      planets, in certain relations with each other, constitutes the solar
      system, so the totality of persons in production relations constitutes the
      economic structure of society, its material basis, its personal apparatus.
      Kautsky, who sometimes confuses technology and economy most sinfully, also
      makes some very vulnerable statements. All such claims may be answered by
      the following passage from the arch-bourgeois, Werner Sombast. This
      professor, who is quite free from materialism, tells us: &quot;Figuratively
      speaking, the economic life may be considered as an organism consisting of
      a body and a soul. The external forms of the operations of the economic
      life are its body; the forms of economic and factory operation, the most
      varied organizations within which and with the aid of which the economic
      process continues.&quot; (Werner Sombart: <I>Der Bourgeois, </I>München
      and Leipzig, 1913, pp.1 &amp; 2.) Of course, the entire economic structure
      of society must be included under the head of economic form and economic
      organization, being therefore, &quot;figuratively speaking&quot;, the body
      of this society.</FONT></P>

    <H4>d. The Outlines of the Superstructure</H4>
    
    <P>Among the remaining phases of social life which we must now consider are
      such phenomena as the social and political system of society (the state,
      the organization of classes, parties, etc.); manners, customs and morals
      (the social norms of human conduct); science and philosophy; religion,
      art, and finally, language, the means of communication between men. These
      phenomena, excepting the social and political system, are frequently
      referred to as our &quot;mental&quot; or &quot;spiritual culture&quot;.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The word <I>culture </I>comes from a Latin verb
      meaning &quot;to cultivate&quot;. Culture therefore means everything that
      is the work of human hands, in the wider sense, <I>i.e., </I>everything
      produced by social man in one form or another. &quot;Mental culture&quot;
      is also a product of the social life, is included in the general
      life-process of society. It cannot be understood unless it be interpreted
      as a portion of this general life-process. Yet, certain bourgeois scholars
      would isolate this &quot;mental culture&quot; absolutely from the
      life-process of society, <I>i.e., </I>they would deify it, make it an
      entity independent of the body, a disembodied spirit. Thus, Alfred Weber
      <I>(Der soziologische Kulturbegriff</I>, in<I> Verhandlungen des zweiten
      deutschen Soziologentages, </I>Tübmgen, 1913), who considers the
      expansion of social life, its intricacy and wealth, as a process of
      external civilization, writes: &quot;But we feel today that culture is
      superior to all these things; that culture means something different to us
      &quot;. Only when &quot; life, rising above its necessities and utilities,
      has assumed a higher level than these things, only <I>then have we a
      culture</I>&quot; (pp.10, 11; Weber's italics). In other words, culture is
      a portion of life, but is not determined by the necessities and utilities
      of life, <I>i.e., </I>it transcends the bounds of society, is not
      conditioned by this society. It is obvious that such a point of view would
      lead to a renunciation of science and an acceptance of faith. Note that
      Weber's chief proof is the fact that &quot;we feel&quot;.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>A useful transition to a consideration of this &quot;mental culture&quot;
      is a study, in broad outline, of the <I>social and political structure of
      </I>society, which is directly determined, as we shall see, by its
      economic structure.</P>
    
    <P>The most obvious expression of the social and political structure of
      society is the state power, which will be understood if we understand the
      necessary condition for the existence of a society of classes. For in such
      a society the various classes must have different interests. Some possess
      all; others, practically nothing; some are in command, and appropriate to
      themselves the products of the work of others; others obey, carry out the
      commands of strangers, and yield up what they have produced with their own
      hands. The position of the classes in production and distribution, i.e.,
      the condition of their existence is their function in society, &quot;their
      social being&quot;, results also in the growth of a specific
      consciousness. As everything in the universe is the result of the
      conditions that bring it about, the various situations of the classes must
      result in a difference in their interests, aspirations, struggles, even in
      their death struggles. It is interesting to observe the nature of the
      equilibrium existing in the <I>structure </I>of a society of classes. The
      fact that such a society, in which, in the words of an English statesman,
      there are in reality two &quot;nations&quot; (classes), can exist at all,
      without danger of disintegrating at any moment, is of itself very
      striking.</P>
    
    <P>Yet there is no doubt of the existence of class societies. In some way
      or other, a unifying bond has been attained in such societies, a sort of
      hoop holding together the staves of the barrel; this hoop is the state, an
      organization of all society, with its threads, retaining them all in the
      system of its tentacles. If we should ask how the state originates, we
      should not be satisfied with any answer attributing a supernatural origin
      to the state, nor with any declaration that the state stands beyond all
      classes; for the simple reason that classless persons do not exist in a
      class society. There would therefore be no material with which to
      construct an organization standing outside of all classes or above all
      classes, no matter how often this may be asserted by bourgeois scholars.
      The organization of the state is altogether an organization of the &quot;ruling
      class&quot;.</P>
    
    <P>It now becomes of interest to determine which is the ruling class, for
      we shall then understand which class is represented by the state power,
      which subjugates all the other classes by means of its strength, its
      force, its mental system, its widely ramified apparatus. The question is
      not difficult to answer. In capitalist society, we find the capitalist
      class dominant in production; it would be absurd to expect to find the
      proletariat permanently dominant in the state, for one of the fundamental
      conditions of equilibrium would now be lacking; either the proletariat
      would also seize control of production, or the bourgeoisie would seize the
      state power. The existence of a society with a specific economic structure
      also involves the adaptation of its state organization; in other words,
      the economic structure of society also determines its state and political
      structure. The state, furthermore, is a huge organization embracing an
      entire nation and ruling many millions of men. This organization needs a
      whole army of employees, officials, soldiers, officers, legislators,
      jurists, ministers, judges, generals, etc., etc., and embraces great
      layers of human beings, one superimposed on the other. This structure is a
      precise reflection of the conditions in production. In capitalist.
      society, for example, the bourgeoisie is in control of production, and
      therefore also of the state. Following upon the manufacturer comes the
      factory superintendent himself, often a capitalist; the same is true of
      the ministers of a capitalist state, its politicians in high places. From
      these circles are recruited the generals for the army; the intermediate
      positions in production are filled by the technical specialist, the
      engineer, the technical mental worker; these mental workers occupy the
      posts of intermediate officials in the state apparatus; they often furnish
      the army officers. The lower employees, as well as the soldiers, are
      furnished by the working class. Of course, there are many fluctuations,
      but the structure of the state authority corresponds closely, on the
      whole, to the structure of society.</P>
    
    <P>If we should assume, for a moment, that by a miracle the lower employees
      had raised themselves above the higher employees, our assumption would
      involve a loss of equilibrium in the whole of society, i.e., a revolution.
      But such a revolution also cannot take place unless corresponding
      alterations have already been accomplished in production. Here also it is
      apparent that the structure of the state apparatus itself reflects the
      economic structure, i.e., the same classes occupy relatively the same
      positions.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Let us give a few examples from various times and
      places. In ancient Egypt, the administration of production was practically
      identical with that of the state, the great landlords heading both. An
      important fraction of production was that turned out by the landlord
      state. The role of the social groups in production coincided with their
      caste, with whether they were higher, middle, or lower officials of the
      state, or slaves (Otto Neurath: <I>Antike Wirtschaftsgeschichte, </I>Leipzig,
      1909, p.8). &quot;The families of the `great' are of course landholding
      families, but they are also, above all, a <I>bureaucratic </I>nobility.&quot;
      (Max Weber: <I>Agrarverhältnisse im Altertum, </I>in <I>Handbuch
      der Staatswissenschaften</I>, vol. i.) Sometimes the combination of state
      authority and leadership in production was emphatically formulated. In the
      Fifteenth Century, the banking house of the Medici ruled the Italian
      trade-capitalist Republic of Florence: &quot;The Bank of the Medici and
      the Florentine State Treasury were identical. The bankruptcy of this
      commercial firm occurred at the same moment as the collapse of the
      Florentine Republic&quot; (M. Pokrovsky: <I>Economic Ma</I>terialism,
      Moscow, 1906, p.27, in Russian). In the second half of the Eighteenth
      Century, the landlords were dominant in Russian production, ruling over
      the peasant serfs. These landlords therefore also controlled the state,
      being specially organized as a privileged nobility. When the peasants rose
      under Pugachov, the landlord-empress Catherine II served as an incarnation
      of the existing state power, when she aided - as &quot;landholder of Kazan&quot;
      - in forming a cavalry regiment for putting down this &quot;rabble&quot;,
      wherewith she aroused a veritable storm of imperial fidelity among the
      Kazan landlords. Her frequent association with French free-thinking
      philosophers did not prevent Catherine from introducing serfdom into
      Ukraine, a contrast which has been well stated by A. Tolstoi:</FONT></P>
    
    <P CLASS="fst"><FONT SIZE="-1">&quot;The great population<BR>
       In your lands<BR>
       Longs for Freedom<BR>
       From your hands.<BR>
       Then spake she full of noble zeal:<BR>
       Messieurs, vows me comblez,<BR>
       Whereupon she extended serfdom<BR>
       To cover Ukraine also.&quot;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the United States, financial capital, a clique of
      bankers and trust magnates, is dominant in production; they also control
      the state power to such an extent that congressional decisions are not
      made before they have been most thoroughly discussed behind the scenes by
      combined capital.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>But the social and political structure of society is not limited to the
      state authority. The ruling class, as well as the oppressed classes,
      present the most varied organizations and forms of common action. Each
      class usually has its vanguard, consisting of its most &quot;class-conscious&quot;
      members, and constituting the political parties competing for domination
      in society. Usually, the ruling class, the oppressed classes, and the &quot;middle
      classes&quot;, each have their specific party. Since there are various
      groups existing within each class, it is obvious that a class may have a
      number of parties, though the most permanent and fundamental of its
      interests can be expressed only in one party. Besides the regularly
      organized bodies, there may be a number of other bodies: the present-day
      American capitalists, for example, have not only organizations to combat
      the workers, but also special organizations for election manipulations
      (Tammany Hall, for example) and organizations for recruiting
      strike-breakers, organizations of industrial spies (the Pinkerton and
      other detective agencies), the secret groups of the most influential
      capitalist firms and the most powerful politicians, following strictly
      conspirative methods; the official state organs always carry out the will
      of these bodies. In Russia, there was an auxiliary organization of the
      state of the landed proprietors, namely, the semi-criminal band of the &quot;Black
      Hundred&quot; which had affiliations with the reigning Romanov dynasty.
      This role was played in Italy, in 1921, by the Fascisti, and in Germany by
      the Orgesch.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#11" NAME="11b">11)</A></SUP>
      The oppressed classes also have a number of economic organizations in
      addition to their parties (for instance, the trade unions), not to mention
      fighting organizations and clubs, in which we may include such bodies as
      the &quot;bands&quot; of Stenka Razin or Pugachov.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#12" NAME="12b">12)</A></SUP>
      In short, all organizations waging the class war, from the <I>jeunesse
      dorée </I>of the German student fraternities up to the state power
      itself, on the one hand-from the party to the club, on the other hand; all
      these are a portion of the social and political structure of society.
      Their basis is as clear as day; their existence is a reflection and an
      expression of <I>classes; </I>here also economy conditions <I>politics</I>.</P>
    
    <P>In our consideration of this &quot;political superstructure&quot;, we
      cannot afford to lose sight of the fact that - as the above examples alone
      would show - this political superstructure is not merely a personal
      apparatus. It consists, for all society, of a combination of things,
      persons, and ideas. For instance, in the state apparatus, we have a
      specific apparatus of things, a specific hierarchy, a certain specific
      system of ideas (procedure, laws, ordinances, etc.), etc. In the case of
      the army, which is a portion of the state, we have a special &quot;technology&quot;
      (cannons, rifles, machine-guns, commissary supplies), its specific
      arrangement of men, &quot;distributed&quot; in a certain way, and its own &quot;ideas&quot;,
      which have been insinuated into the minds of all the members of the army
      by means of a complicated military drill and a special educational
      apparatus (spirit of subordination, discipline, etc.). Viewed from this
      angle, the picture of the army will suggest the following inferences. The
      technology of the army is determined by the general technology of
      productive labor in the given society; cannons cannot be manufactured
      before the casting of steel has been learnt, <I>i.e., </I>before the
      necessary means of production have been obtained. The distribution of
      persons, the structure of the army, depends on the military science and
      also the class alignment of society. On the existence of weapons, and on
      the nature of these weapons, depends the division of the army into
      artillery, infantry, engineers, cavalry, sappers, etc.; on this will
      depend what types of soldiers, superiors, persons with special functions
      (for example, telephone operators) are present in the army. On the other
      hand, the class alignment of society will determine from what social layer
      the staff of officers is recruited; by the representatives of what class
      the actions of the army are controlled, etc.; finally, the specific mental
      attitudes with which the army is imbued are conditioned, on the one hand,
      by the army structure (memorizing regulations, <I>cadavre </I>obedience,
      etc.), and on the other hand by the class structure of society. In the
      Tsar's army the slogan was &quot;Obey the Tsar&quot;, &quot;For God,
      Emperor and Fatherland&quot;; in the Red Army the slogan is &quot;Preserve
      discipline in order to protect the workers against the imperialists.&quot;
      These examples are sufficient to show that the social and political
      superstructure is a complicated thing, consisting of different elements,
      which are interrelated. On the whole, this structure is determined by the
      class outline of society, a structure which in turn depends on the
      productive forces, <I>i.e., </I>on the social technology. Certain of
      these elements are directly dependent on technology (&quot;the art of war&quot;);
      others depend on the class character of society (its. economy), as well as
      on the technology of the superstructure itself (&quot;army management&quot;).
      All the elements of the superstructure are therefore directly or
      indirectly based on the stage that has been reached by the social
      productive forces.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">A special place among human organizations is held by
      the organization of the family, i.e., the living together of men, women,
      and children. This clan organization, which was constantly changing, was
      based on certain economic conditions. &quot;The family, also, is not only
      a social, but preeminently an economic formation, based on the division of
      labor between man and woman, on `sexual differentiation' &quot; Primitive
      marriage is nothing else than the expression of this economic union.&quot;
      (Müller-Lyer, ibid., p.150; <I>cf. </I>Marx: <I>Capital</I>, vol.
      i, Chicago, 1915, p.386: &quot;Within a single family &quot; there arises
      a primitive distribution of labor based on differences of sex and age . .
      . .&quot;) The family thus arises as a firm unit by reason of the
      alterations in the economic order of the clan, which was a primitive state
      of communism (the original form of relation between the sexes was
      promiscuity, i.e., unregulated sexual relations between men and women). M.
      N. Pokrovsky characterizes the primitive Slavic family as follows: &quot;The
      members of this family, workers in the same economy, soldiers of the same
      detachment, and finally, worshipers of the same god, participants in the
      same rite&quot; (<I>History of Russia</I>, Moscow, 1920, pp.17, 18, in
      Russian). But the economic basis of such a family is further clarified by
      the following fact. &quot;It would be erroneous,&quot; &quot;to assign a
      dominant importance to these says M. N. Pokrovsky, blood ties: they are
      customary, but not inevitable. Such collective establishments were
      conducted in the North (of Russia) by persons who were strangers to each
      other, on the basis of contracts; they founded such communities, not for
      all time, but for a definite period, for instance, for ten years &quot;
      Here also, the economic connection antedates the ties of blood, the
      `relation' in our sense of the term&quot; (ibid., p.16). The changed forms
      of family relations, in accordance with the economic conditions, may be
      traced even in modern times: we need only to compare the peasant family,
      the workers' family, and the modern bourgeois family. The peasant family
      is a firm unit, for it is based directly on production. &quot;There must
      be a woman in the house,&quot; for who else would milk the cows, feed the
      pigs, cook the food, tidy the rooms, wash, take care of the children,
      etc.? The economic significance of the family is so great that marriages
      are dictated by specific economic calculation: &quot;there is no woman in
      the house&quot;. Economically considered, the members of the family are &quot;workers&quot;
      and &quot;eaters&quot;. Built up on this comparatively rigid basis, the
      peasant family is itself characterized by patriarchal rigidity, when
      untouched by the &quot;corrupting&quot; influence of the city. The
      workers' family is different. The worker has no economy of his own. His &quot;household&quot;
      is a consumption economy only; it consumes its wages. Simultaneously, the
      city, with its saloons, restaurants, laundries, etc., makes the household
      largely superfluous. Finally, large-scale industry disintegrates the
      family, forcing the proletarian woman to work in a factory. More mobile,
      less stable forms of family relations arise from these circumstances. In
      the upper middle class, private property requires the preservation of the
      family. But the increasing parasitism of the bourgeoisie, and the growth
      of entire strata who live by cutting coupons, transform the wife into a
      thing, into a bedizened but very stupid plaything, a boudoir appurtenance.
      The various forms of marriage (monogamy, polygamy, polyandry, etc.) are
      likewise dependent on the conditions of economic evolution. Furthermore,
      it must not be forgotten that sexual intercourse has practically never
      been limited to the family. The forms of prostitution, and their
      distribution, are again connected with the economy of society; we need
      only to point out the rô1e of prostitution in the capitalist system.
      It seems reasonable to assume that communist society, which will
      definitely abolish private property and the enslavement of women, will
      witness the disappearance both of prostitution and the family.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The other phases of the &quot;superstructure&quot; are a result of man's
      living in society, or in individual sections of society, in a condition
      either of outright conflict or of incomplete harmony. The expression of
      this condition is the social necessity of social norms, including customs,
      morals, law, and a great number of other standards (&quot;rules of decent
      behavior&quot;, &quot;etiquette&quot;, ceremonial, etc.; also the
      constitutions of the various societies, organizations, brotherhoods,
      etc.), all of which are produced by the accumulation of contradictions in
      a mature and complicated society. The most striking of these
      contradictions <I>is </I>the class contradiction, which therefore &quot;demands&quot;
      a mighty regulator for the purpose of suppressing this contradiction at
      certain times; the state power with its legal decisions, its standards of
      law, constitutes such a regulator. There are also subsidiary
      contradictions between the classes, within the classes, also within
      trades, groups, organizations, and in all human categories in general.
      Regardless of his class position, each individual comes in contact with
      all kinds of people, is subject to various influences which interact at
      many points; he finds himself placed in swiftly changing circumstances,
      which may disappear and later again assert themselves. Contradictions are
      here found at every step, and yet society and certain groups within it
      continue their relatively permanent existence. The capitalists, owners of
      enterprises, traders, merchants, compete in the market; yet they rarely
      resort to armed conflict with each other within the same state, and their
      class does not collapse because of the competitive struggle between its
      members. While buyers and sellers have distinctly opposed interests, they
      do not belabor each other physically. There are unemployed persons among
      the workers, whom the capitalists attempt to win over during a strike; but
      not every such person can be utilized; the class bond among the workers is
      too strong. This condition is a result of a great variety of standards
      existing by the side of the legal standards. These supplementary norms
      impress themselves on the minds of men, apparently from some inner source,
      and appear sacred to them, being voluntarily adhered o. Of such nature,
      for example, are the rules of morality, which are represented in a
      commercial society as eternal and immutably sacred laws, radiating their
      own light and binding on all decent eople; similar is the case with
      customs, &quot;duties to the great departed&quot;, &quot;rules of decency&quot;,
      &quot;courtesy&quot;, etc.</P>
    
    <P>In spite of the alleged &quot;supernatural&quot; character of these
      laws, their earthly roots may easily be traced, regardless of the pious
      awe of all their submissive adherents. A closer observation forces us to
      recognize two fundamental conditions: first, that these laws are subject
      to change; second, that they are connected with class, group, occupation,
      etc. It is also obvious that &quot;in the last analysis&quot; they are
      likewise conditioned by the level attained by the productive forces. In
      general, these rules indicate the line of conduct conducive to a
      preservation of the society, class, or group in question, and requiring a
      subordination of the individual to the interests of the group. These norms
      are therefore <I>conditions of equilibrium </I>for holding together the
      internal contradictions of human social systems, whence it results that
      they must more or less coincide with the economic structure of society. It
      is impossible, for instance, in any society, for the system of its <I>dominant
      </I>manners and customs to be in permanent contradiction with its
      fundamental economic structure. Such an opposition would mean the complete
      absence of the fundamental condition for social equilibrium. It is on the
      basis of the economic conditions that law, customs and morals are evolved
      in any society; they change and disappear with the economic system. Thus,
      in capitalist society, the capitalist controls things (instruments of
      production), a condition which is reflected in the laws of the capitalist
      state, in the so called right to private property, which is protected by
      the entire apparatus of the state power. The production conditions of
      capitalist society are juridically termed <I>property relations</I>;
      these relations are supported by many laws. A condition under which the
      laws of capitalist society would not protect the property relations of
      this society, but destroy them, is inconceivable. Similarly, the &quot;moral
      consciousness&quot; of capitalist society reflects and expresses its
      material being. Thus, in the field of private property, morality teaches
      that theft is to be condemned; honesty and the inviolability of the
      property of others are inculcated. And quite naturally, for without this
      moral law which has imbedded itself in the minds of men, capitalist
      society would at once disintegrate.</P>
    
    <P>Apparent contradictions to the above can be easily disposed of. While
      communists do not believe in the sacredness of private property, they do
      not approve of stealing. It may be urged that this indicates the presence
      of something that is sacred for all men, that cannot be explained by
      earthly causes. The facts of the case are quite different: it is true that
      communists by no means recognize the inviolability of private property;
      the nationalization of factories is an expropriation of the bourgeoisie;
      the working class appropriates &quot;the property of others&quot;,
      transgresses the right of private property, undertakes a &quot;despotic
      intervention in the right of property&quot; (Karl Marx: <I>The Communist
      Manifesto</I>). But communists condemn stealing, for the reason that
      individual thefts by each worker from the capitalists, for his own
      advantage, would not result in a common struggle, but would make the
      worker a petty bourgeois. Horse-thieves and swindlers will not fight in
      the class struggle, even though they may be offspring of the proletariat.
      If many members of the proletariat should become thieves, the class would
      break down and be condemned to impotence; therefore, communists condemn
      stealing, not in order to protect private property, but in order to
      maintain the integrity of their class, to protect it from &quot;demoralization&quot;
      and &quot;disintegration&quot;, without which protection the proletariat
      can never be transformed into the next following stage. We are therefore
      dealing with a <I>class standard </I>in the conduct of the proletariat.
      It is obvious that the rules we have considered are determined by the
      economic conditions of society.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The proletarian standards, of course, are in
      contradiction with the economic conditions of capitalist society. But we
      have been speaking of <I>dominant standards</I>; as soon as the
      proletarian standards become dominant, capitalism will be a thing of the
      past (see next chapter).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">A number of examples will be given to explain the above
      statements. In the sexual field, at a certain stage of development, when
      the clan was still based on bland relationship and members of other clans
      were considered enemies, marriages between close relations were not
      objectionable; particularly sacred was a marriage with one's mother or
      daughter (in the ancient Iranian religion).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">When the productive forces were at a low level, and the
      social economy could not afford any superfluous ballast, manners and
      morals required the <I>slaying of old men</I>, as is reported by the
      ancient historians Herodotus, Strabo, etc. This was the cause for the
      voluntary self-poisonings (reported by Strabo) of old men. On the other
      hand, where these old men had a function in production or administration,
      morality required that they be honored (<I>cf. </I>Eduard Meyer: <I>Elemente
      der Anthropologie</I>, pp.31-33, <I>et seq</I>.). The close-knit
      nature of the clan, its solidarity when combating enemies, assumed the
      form of blood revenge, in which women also participated. Thus, we read in
      the Nibelungenlied:</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Eduard Meyer correctly says: &quot;In content, the laws
      of morality, of customs, and of justice, depend on the social order and
      the communal views of the community, prevailing at the time &quot; They
      may therefore be diametrically opposed in content, if they represent
      different societies and different periods&quot; (<I>ibid</I>., p.44). In
      ancient China, a peculiarly constructed feudal state authority with a
      great stratum of officials of various degree, was of great importance. The
      rule of this feudal-bureaucratic stratum was ideologically based on the
      teaching of Confucius, a system of rules of conduct. One of the most
      important points in this moral teaching was the doctrine of respect and
      submission to those in authority (<I>Hiao</I>); &quot;Calumnies must
      be borne, even though they drive us into death, if the honor of the master
      require it; one can (and should) always make good <I>all </I>the master's
      errors by <I>faithful </I>service; such was <I>Hiao&quot; </I>(Max
      Weber: <I>Gesammelte Aufsätze zur Religionsphilosophie, </I>Tübingen,
      1920, vol. i, p.419). Violation of <I>Hiao </I>was the only sin. One who
      did not understand this, who therefore had no grasp of &quot;propriety&quot;
      (a fundamental conception in the Confucian doctrine) was a barbarian. &quot;Respect
      (<I>Hiao</I>) toward one's feudal lord was enumerated together with that
      toward parents, teachers, superiors in the official hierarchy, and
      officeholders in general&quot; (<I>ibid., </I>p.446). Discipline, like
      respect, is a worthy virtue. &quot;Insubordination is worse than baseness&quot;
      (p.447). The case may be generally stated: &quot;Better be a dog in peace,
      than a man living in anarchy,&quot; as Cheng Ki Tong says (p.457). &quot;Like
      any code for officials, the Confucian code of course also condemned any
      participation by officials in business, directly or indirectly, as
      ethically objectionable and not in accord with their rank&quot; (p.447).
      Friends must be chosen only from one's own rank, for they can fulfil all
      the ceremonies; the population consists of &quot;stupid men&quot; (<I>yun
      min</I>), as contrasted with the man of princely station.
      Characteristically enough, this entire system of standards supporting the
      feudal noble regime was called the &quot;great plan&quot;, <I>hung fan</I>,
      (p. 454). It is obvious that this teaching is closely related with the
      system of society. The numerous &quot;Chinese ceremonies&quot; were in
      reality based on the dominant currents of thought, and served as a
      complicated silken tissue enmeshing the social structure and guarding the
      existing order.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Or, let us consider the medieval knights of Northern
      France, in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries, who sang of their fair
      ladies and fought tournaments &quot;for them&quot;; their &quot;ideal&quot;
      views of &quot;honor and love&quot; bore all the earmarks of a <I>caste
      </I>honor (<I>cf. </I>H. Helmolt, <I>Weltgeschichte, </I>Leipzig and
      Vienna, vol. v). The chief role played by knighthood in society was that
      of war and strategy. The &quot;standards&quot; therefore had to serve the
      purpose of training a military type of man, segregated in a special class.
      &quot;A knight, who &quot; had shown himself to be a coward, was cast out,
      publicly outlawed by the herald, cursed by the Church; his escutcheon and
      arms were destroyed by the hangman, his shield tied to the tail of a horse
      and smashed by the animal in his swift course &quot;&quot; &quot;For <I>training
      in the profession of </I>arms, there were <I>tournaments, </I>in addition
      to military campaigns and feuds&quot; (p.496).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">&quot;As the capitalist relations grow, the dominant
      customs, morals, etc., change. Generous wastefulness is replaced by a
      desire for accumulation and the corresponding virtues.&quot; &quot;A
      decent man is not honored by his lordly manner, but by his keeping order
      in his establishment&quot; (W. Sombart, <I>Der Bourgeois</I>, p.140). &quot;One
      must refrain from revelry, must appear only in decent company; must not be
      addicted to drinking, gambling, women; one must be a good `citizen' even
      in one's external conduct, for reasons of business interest. For, such a
      moral conduct of life <I>raises one's credit&quot; </I>(<I>ibid</I>.,
      pp.162, 163). Of course, this pious Protestant morality was succeeded by a
      different morality when the situation of the bourgeoisie changed, the
      business of the firm no longer depending on the conduct of its owner.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is an even easier matter to show how law changes
      with the economic structure, for here the class character of law is
      manifest everywhere. But even such intangible standards as those of <I>fashion
      </I>depend - as may be easily proved - on social conditions. For a
      bourgeois it is &quot;indecent&quot; not to dress in accordance with his
      standing; for this class trait of clothing indicates &quot;persons of
      quality&quot;. Even revolutionists are subject to the caprices of fashion;
      a party fashion in the revolution of 1905 was the wearing of black blouses
      by the Social-Democrats (a sign of the proletariat), while the
      Social-Revolutionists preferred red ones (revolutionary peasantry); you
      could hardly find a dozen intellectuals in any big city, who had
      participated in the revolution and yet ignored these passively accepted
      party fashions.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In addition to a class morality, we also have
      subdivisions of this morality, for example, professional ethics, the
      vocational morals of physicians, lawyers, etc. There is also a thief
      morality (&quot;there is honor among thieves&quot;), which is rather
      strictly complied with. All the standards above mentioned constitute firm
      bonds emphasizing the unity of a society, a class, a vocational group,
      etc.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><I>Science and Philosophy </I>are also a category of social phenomena.
      We shall see that the latter is based on all the accomplishments of the
      former. Any fairly advanced science is a very complicated thing,, not
      limited to systems of ideas alone. The sciences have their technique,
      their physical apparatus, instruments, appliances, charts, books,
      laboratories, museums, etc.; any laboratory or any scientific expedition,
      to the North Pole or to Central Africa, will serve as an illustration;
      they also have their personal apparatus, sometimes highly organized (for
      example, scientific congresses, conferences, academies and other
      organizations, with their periodical and other publications); and finally,
      there is the system of ideas, of thoughts in orderly arrangement,
      constituting the science in the proper sense of the word.</P>
    
    <P>The following principle is of fundamental importance: every science is
      born from practice, from the conditions and needs of the struggle for life
      on the part of social man with nature, and of the various social groups,
      with the elemental forces of society or with other social groups. &quot;The
      savage has had the most varied experiences; he can distinguish venomous
      and edible plants, pursue the traces of game and protect himself from
      beasts of prey and venomous serpents. He can make use of fire and water,
      select stones and wood for his weapons, smelt and work metals. He can
      count and calculate with his fingers, make measurements with his hands and
      feet like a child, he sees the firmament, observes its motions and the
      changed positions of sun and planets. All or most of his observations are
      made casually or for the purpose of a useful application. These primitive
      observations are the germ of the various sciences. The latter can only
      exist when freedom from material cares has resulted in a sufficient
      quantity of comfort and leisure, and when the intellect has been
      sufficiently strengthened by frequent use, to make <I>observations per se
      </I>. . , a matter of interest.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#13" NAME="13b">13)</A></SUP>
      Science therefore can begin only when the growth <I>of </I>the productive
      forces has left free time for scientific observation. Also, the original
      material of science is material taken from the field of production. It
      should therefore not surprise us that the immediate maintenance of life by
      production, i.e., the interests <I>of </I>production, gave the first
      impulse to the growth of science. Prac<I>tice </I>created theory and
      impelled it onward.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Astronomy arose from the need of finding one's bearings
      by the stars in desert plains, from the significance of the seasons in
      agriculture, the need of a precise division of time (astronomical control
      of clocks, for instance), etc. Physics was intimately connected with the
      technique of material production and warfare. Chemistry arose on the basis
      of an expanding industrial production, particularly mining; the beginnings
      of chemistry are already found in Egypt and China, in the manufacture of
      glass, dyeing, enameling, the production of paints, metallurgy, etc.; the
      word <I>chemistry is </I>derived from <I>chemi, </I>&quot;black&quot;,
      thus suggesting its Egyptian origin. Alchemy is found among the ancient
      Egyptians, the outgrowth of the desire to find the law of transmutation of
      metals into gold; in the Fifteenth Century, chemistry was much aided by
      medicine. Mineralogy arises from the use of metals in production, and
      their study for purposes of production. Botany originally consisted of a
      knowledge of healing plants, later of useful plants, still later, of
      plants in general. Zoology developed from the necessity of understanding
      the useful and harmful qualities of animals. Anatomy, physiology,
      pathology, started from practical medicine (the first &quot;specialists&quot;
      in this field were Egyptian, East Indian, Greek and Roman physicians, such
      as the Greek Hippocrates, the Roman Claudius Galenus, etc.). Geography and
      ethnography were developed by trade and colonial warfare. The ablest
      commercial peoples of antiquity (for instance, the Phwnicians,
      Carthaginians, etc.), were also the best geographers. Geography was
      neglected in the Middle Ages, a great renewal of interest in the subject
      coming in modern times, beginning with the Fifteenth Century, in the era
      of the colonial wars waged by the trade-capitalist nations, and the
      half-commercial, half-predatory, half-scientific voyages connected with
      these wars. The voyages and discoveries were performed chiefly by the
      predatory commercial nations: Portugal, Spain, England, Holland. Ethnology
      was also encouraged by colonial policy, the practical question being the
      learning of a method of utilizing savages for labor for the advantage of
      the &quot;civilized&quot; bourgeoisie. Mathematics, the science that is
      apparently most remote from practice, was nevertheless of practical
      origin; its original tools were those first used in material production:
      the fingers, hands, feet (counting on one's fingers), the quinary,
      decimal, vicenary systems; the original designations for the angles, etc.,
      after the bend in the knee; units of length: the ell, foot, etc. (cf.
      Cantor: <I>Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Mathematik</I>,
      Leipzig, 1907, vol. i). The material basis of mathematics was the needs of
      production: surveying (&quot;geometry&quot; means &quot;earth-measurement&quot;),
      the erection of buildings, measuring the content of vessels, shipbuilding;
      still earlier, the number of cattle; in the commercial period, commercial
      arithmetic, inventory, balance-sheet, etc. The Egyptian and Greek
      geometers, the Roman <I>agrimensores, </I>the Alexandrian engineers ( for
      instance, Hero of Alexandria, who invented a sort of steam-engine) were
      simultaneously the first mathematicians (Rudolf Eisler: <I>Geschichte der
      Wissenschaften, </I>Leipzig, 1906). The case of the social sciences (as
      already discussed in our Introduction) is in no way different. History
      arose from the need of knowing the &quot;destinies of nations&quot;, for
      purposes of practical politics. Legal science began with the collection
      and codification of the most important laws, again for practical purposes.
      Political economy arose with capitalism, originally as a science of
      merchants, serving the needs of their class policy. The philological
      sciences arose in the form of &quot;grammars&quot; of the various
      languages, as a result of commercial relations and the requirements of
      intercourse. Statistics began with merchants' &quot;tables&quot;, each
      dealing with a specific country (likewise, the first beginnings of
      political economy; one of the earliest economists, William Petty, calls
      one of his works: <I>&quot;Political Arithmetic&quot;), </I>etc., etc.
      New sciences are arising from production before our very eyes, for
      instance, the technical experiences acquired in the application of the
      Taylor system give rise to so called <I>psycho-technxcs, </I>the
      psychophysiology of labor, the theory of the organization of production,
      etc.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>With the gradual extension, division, and specialization of the
      sciences, their direct or indirect dependence on the stage of the
      productive forces nevertheless continues in evidence. As the natural human
      organs, in the direct process of material production in society, are &quot;extended,&quot;
      and by this extension, &quot;contrary to the Bible&quot;, are enabled to
      embrace and manipulate a much greater material, so the &quot;extended&quot;
      consciousness of human society is <I>science, </I>increasing its mental
      compass and enabling it to grasp and consequently better to control, a
      greater mass of phenomena.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is interesting to note that many bourgeois scholars,
      when speaking concretely of science, involuntarily assume this materialist
      standpoint. But they dare not pursue it to the end. Thus a well-known
      Russian scholar, Professor Chuprov (junior) speaks of the &quot;significance
      of science&quot; as follows: &quot;While life remains uncomplicated, men
      in their daily affairs content themselves with the `experiences of life',
      an accidental method of accumulating incoherent bits of knowledge and
      habit, passed on from father to son as a tradition. But as the sphere of
      interest widens, these formless bits of knowledge cease to fulfil
      requirements; there arises a need for systematic work; consciously and
      planfully devoted to an understanding of the surrounding universe, <I>i.e.,
      </I>science. As soon as men have learned that <I>scientia et ptentia
      humana in idem coincident </I>(science and human knowledge are identical),
      and that <I>quod in contemplatione instar causae est, id in operatione
      instar regulae est </I>(that which appears as cause in observation, is the
      rule in the effect), they grasp the thought that <I>ignoratio causae
      destituit effectum. </I>(failure to recognise the cause destroys the
      result), and learn to appreciate science as the basis of practical labor&quot;(<I>Outlines
      of the Theory of Statistics, </I>St. Petersburg, 1909, pp.21, 22, in
      Russian).</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The connection between the state of science and the productive forces of
      society is of manifold nature. This connection must be studied from a
      number of angles, for it is not as simple as may first appear. We shall
      therefore have to turn our attention, in our consideration of science, to
      its technique, its special organization of work, its content, its method
      (or alleged method), for all these components interact mutually and
      produce the level of the given science at a given time. Each of these
      elements will lead back directly or indirectly to the social technology.</P>
    
    <P>In the first place, the very existence of society is possible only after
      the productive forces have attained a certain level in their development.
      If the labor surplus is absent or limited and not increased, the growth of
      science is impossible.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">&quot;This desire for science could not be displayed
      before man had satisfied his other appetites . . . . Certain very old
      observations are handed down to us from China, India, Egypt, but it is
      interesting to note that they were but imperfectly developed in those
      countries&quot; (A. Bordeaux: <I>Histoire des sciences physiques,
      chimiques et géologiques au XIX siècle, </I>Paris and Liege,
      1920, p.11).</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The content of science is determined in the last analysis by the
      technical and economic phase of society; these are the &quot;practical
      roots&quot;, which explain why an identical scientific discovery,
      invention, or study, may be achieved simultaneously in different places,
      perhaps quite &quot;independently&quot;. The &quot;ideas&quot; are said to
      be in the air, meaning that they grow out of the existing stage of life.
      That has been produced by the level of the productive forces.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In his <I>Histoire, </I>A. Bordeaux mentions the
      following discoveries resulting, as he puts it, from the presence of ideas
      &quot;in the air&quot;, and from the conditions of life <I>(par
      l'existence des idées dans l'air et par les circonstances de
      la vie): the </I>discovery of the relation between heat and mechanical
      work, induction, the induction coil, the Gramme ring, the infinitesimal
      calculus (mentioned not only by Leibnitz and Newton, but also by their
      predecessors Fermat, Cavalieri, etc., as far back as Archimedes). Bordeaux
      concludes: &quot;As for science, . . . it shows &quot; how difficult it is
      to determine which <I>person </I>really made a certain discovery&quot; (<I>ibid</I>.,
      p.8). Let us note that the practical object of a science by no means
      presupposes that <I>each </I>scientific principle <I>directly </I>influences
      practice. Assuming the theorem A to be important for practice, and that
      this theorem cannot be proved except with the use of the theorems, B, C,
      D, and that the three latter theorems are of no <I>direct </I>practical
      value (being, as we say, of &quot;purely theoretical interest&quot;),
      these theorems nevertheless are indirectly of practical significance as
      links in a single scientific chain. There are no useless or worthless
      scientific systems, just as there are no useless mechanical tools.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>While the problems have been put chiefly by technology and economy,
      their solution in many sciences depends on alterations in the <I>scientific
      technique, </I>whose instruments are of extraordinary importance in
      widening the horizon. The microscope, for example, was invented in the
      first half of the Seventeenth Century and of course, had an immense
      influence on the evolution of science by favoring the development of
      botany, zoology, anatomy, in creating a new branch of science,
      bacteriology, etc. Equally obvious is the role of technique in astronomy
      (equipment of observatories, varieties of telescopes, devices for
      photographing stars, etc.). , In its turn, scientific technique depends on
      the material production in general (is a product of material labor). In
      scientific work, we usually find a corresponding <I>organization of this
      work</I>, also influencing the state of scientific knowledge. The division
      of scientific labor (specialization in science), the organization of great
      scientific units (e.g., laboratories), the establishment of scientific
      bodies and scientific intercourse are extremely important. All these
      phases, again, are ultimately determined by the economic and technical
      conditions; thus, modern chemical laboratories grow with the industrial
      plants to which they are attached; scientific intercourse becomes more
      frequent with the greater frequency of economic connections, etc. But
      technical and economic conditions also &quot;condition&quot; science in
      another respect. With the rapid expansion of technology, economic
      conditions and the entire standard of life are constantly changing,
      resulting not only in a swift growth of science, but in its acceptance of
      the concept of change as a guiding factor (use of the <I>dynamic </I>method,
      see chapter iii). Conversely, where technology is conservative and of slow
      growth, the economic life will also advance but slowly, and the human
      psychology infers that all things are permanent. Society then marks time
      and is governed by the principle of permanence. The <I>class
      characteristics</I> in the various branches of science also present
      themselves, reflecting either the <I>mode of thought </I>characteristic
      of the specific class, or the <I>interests of </I>the class. Mode of
      thought, interests, etc., are, in their turn, determined by the economic
      structure of society. </P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Let us give a few of these relations. In ancient times,
      technology - as we know - developed slowly, with a resulting slow advance
      in technical knowledge. &quot;This neglect of technology has several
      causes: in the first place, antiquity was &quot;entirely aristocratic in
      its attitude. Even prominent artists, such as Phidias, are classed as
      artisans; they are incapable of bursting through the stone wall &quot;
      separating the aristocratic circle &quot; from the artisans and peasants.
      . . A second cause of the slight progress of technical discovery in
      antiquity is in its slave-holding system &quot; We therefore find a lack
      of any impulse to develop the machine as a substitute for manual labor &quot;
      Science &quot; was dead and the interest in technical problems, except for
      a few curiosities, such as water-clocks and water-organs, had died out&quot;
      (Hermann Diels: <I>Wissenschaft und Technik bei den Hellenen, </I>in <I>Antike
      Technik, </I>Leipzig and Berlin, 1920, pp.31-33). Thence the character of
      the existing science: &quot;The natural sciences probably arose as a
      by-product of artisan work. But since such work, as well as any manual
      work, was despised in ancient society, and as the slaves who observed
      nature were sharply distinguished from the masters who speculated and
      worked as amateurs at their leisure, often knowing nature only by hearsay,
      it is easy to explain much of the naive, vague and mystical nature of
      ancient natural science&quot; (Ernst Mach: <I>Erkenntnis und Irrtum, </I>Leipzig,
      1905, p.95, Mach's italics). In the Middle Ages we have a feeble and
      primitive technology, with feudal relations in economic life, an entire
      system of superiors has been elaborated, culminating in the landlord and
      monarch. It should not surprise us to learn that the dominant thought was
      not very mobile, resisting all that was new (heresy was punished with
      burning and quartering), not occupying itself with the investigation of
      nature, but delving in theological problems. The important problems of
      discussion were: the bodily size of Adam, whether he had brown or red
      hair, how many angels could stand on the point of a needle, etc. This
      immobile, conservative theological (formal, &quot;scholastic&quot;)
      character of the science of the time, entirely opposed to experimental
      investigation, may be explained by the conditions of the social life, by
      the technical and economic relations, which ultimately rested on the stage
      of social evolution. The case became quite different, when capitalist
      relations began to grow. We now are no longer dealing with a rigid
      technology, but with one that is rapidly changing, with new branches of
      production constantly growing up; we now need mechanics, engineers,
      chemists, and not theologians or knights; warfare also requires scientific
      knowledge, as well as mathematics. It is natural that this shift in the
      technical and economic relations also necessarily resulted in a
      transformation of science: Scholasticism, Latin, Theology, etc., gave way
      to an experimental investigation of nature, to the natural sciences, to
      the Realist School. We have here given an example of the general
      transformation in the content of science. We might, with close study, also
      trace this transformation in the methods of investigation, the tools of
      scientific thought, and in many other phases of science.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">An example of the influence of the class psychology,
      and consequently also of the class structure of society, is afforded by
      the organic theory in sociology, already mentioned by us. Professor R. J.
      Wipper says the following on this subject: &quot;The comparison of society
      with an organism, the expression, the `organic connection of the
      individual with society', as contrasted with the connection in a
      mechanical society, all these comparisons, formulas, and antitheses were
      launched by the reactionary publicists of the Nineteenth Century. In
      setting up this organ as opposed to a mechanism, these publicists were
      attempting to distinguish their demands sharply from the didactic and
      revolutionary principles of the previous century (the Era of
      Enlightenment). `The state is a mechanism', was the old terminology: equal
      rights for all men, whose totality constitutes the sovereign people; `the
      state is an organism', was the new slogan: arrangement of men in a
      traditional social hierarchy, subjection of the individual to a `natural'
      group, .e., his subordination to the old social authority. Translated into
      concrete language, the 'organic' relations mean: serfdom, the guild
      system, subordination of workers to employers, defense of the honor and
      privileges of the nobility, etc.&quot; (Wipper: <I>A Few Observations on
      the Theory of Historical Knowledge, </I>in the collection <I>Two
      Intelligentsias, </I>Moscow, 1912, pp.47, 48, in Russian.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">We give below a few additional data on the history of
      mathematics, since it is commonly assumed that mathematics, being a purely
      contemplative science, has nothing in common with practical life. We take
      them from the very important work of M. Cantor (<I>Vorlesungen über
      die Geschichte der Mathematik, </I>Leipzig, 1907, vol. i). Mathematical
      knowledge arose among the Babylonians, developing on the basis of
      surveying, measuring the cubic contents of vessels, commercial arithmetic,
      and the need of a precise division of time (the calendar) into years,
      days, hours, etc. The original mathematical instruments were the fingers.
      Later, calculating machines: a rope with little rods (Sumerian: <I>tim)
      </I>in geometry; later, an instrument recalling the astrolabe.
      Mathematical study was closely connected with religion, the numerals at
      first indicating the gods, their celestial precedence, etc. Mathematics
      attained a high state of development among the Egyptians; the ancient
      mathematical <I>&quot;Calculation Book of Ahmes&quot; </I>(its precise
      title is: &quot;Rules for obtaining a knowledge of all obscure things &quot;
      of all secrets which are contained in objects&quot;) contains such
      headings as: &quot;Rule for Calculating a Round Granary&quot;, &quot;Rule
      for Calculating Fields&quot;, &quot;Rule for Making an Adornment&quot;,
      etc. (<I>ibid., </I>pp.58, 59). Arithmetical and occasionally algebraic
      operations are illustrated by means of problems clearly indicating the
      conditions of practice. This practice involves: distribution of grain,
      distribution of rye, calculation of receipts, etc. &quot; (p.79 <I>et
      seq.</I>). The concluding statement of this mathematical primer
      clearly shows its connection with agriculture; we read: &quot;Catch
      vermin, mice, gather fresh weeds, numerous spiders, beg (the god) Ra for
      warmth, wind, high water&quot; (p.85). The fingers were obviously the
      first calculating instruments, later a sort of board (with knotted twine,
      as in the case of the Peruvians). The basis of geometry was surveying;
      besides problems in the measurement of fields, Ahmes also has problems for
      calculating the volume of granaries and the amount of grain they may hold
      (p. 98). The Greek historian Diodorus writes of the-Egyptians: &quot;The
      priests teach their sons two kinds of writing, the so called sacred
      writing and a common writing. They diligently study geometry and
      arithmetic. For the river (the Nile) changes the country considerably each
      year, thus producing much litigation concerning boundaries between
      neighbors; such divisions cannot be adjusted without direct measurements
      made by a geometer. Arithmetic serves them in their <I>household affairs</I>&quot;
      (p.303, my italics, N. B.). The astronomical, geometrical and algebraic
      rules were first connected with religious rites; they were sacred
      mysteries in which only a select few were initiated. The so called &quot;harpedonapts&quot;
      (rope-weavers, or literally, rope-knotters) possessed the trade secret of
      setting the rope, of placing it at the proper angle with the meridian,
      etc. (In fact, in general, the angles and sides of pyramids, the
      arrangement of their parts, had a certain sacred astronomical-scientific
      meaning, which was probably imparted to the &quot;sons of the priests&quot;.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Among the Romans, geometry advanced with the needs of
      landed property, which was so holy that even the gods possessed it.
      Mathematics attained its highest development (&quot;exceptional period,&quot;
      according to Cantor). This exceptional condition of development was due to
      the presence of two practical problems: the construction of the calendar
      (the so called Julian Calendar; Julius Caesar himself wrote a book on the
      stars, <I>De astris</I>), and the great survey of the Roman Empire. The
      latter problem was solved under Augustus, the great Greek engineer and
      mathematician, Hero of Alexandria, being invited to conduct the work; for
      the first time a complete map of the entire empire was compiled. We later
      find, in Columella, a consideration of mathematics in its relations with
      agriculture; in Sextius Julius Frontinus, a treatment of mathematics as
      applied to the calculation of aqueduct tubes (the important mathematical
      symbol p, to represent the ratio between circumference and diameter of the
      circle). In the so called <I>Codex Arcerianus </I>(a legal-scientific
      reference work for administrative officials of the Roman Empire, in the
      Sixth and Seventh Centuries, A.D.), we find a number of articles on
      field-surveying for purposes of taxation (Cantor, <I>ibid</I>., p.454).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The development of arithmetic was due chiefly to the
      demands of trade. Interest calculations, according to Horace an
      accomplishment of daily use, calculations of inheritance bequests, in
      accordance with the complicated Roman legislation, merchants' calculations
      - they were the motives underlying the evolution of arithmetic.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Among the ancient East Indians, we find astronomy,
      algebra and the beginnings of trigonometry. The conditions in this country
      resemble those found among other ancient peoples. The mathematical
      chapters of a learned collected work (the <I>Aryabhattd) </I>give
      evidence, in the designations and content of the problems, of the living
      basis of Indian mathematics. A mathematical method, for instance, is
      suggested in the following verse: &quot;Multiplications become divisions,
      divisions become multiplications; what was <I>profit </I>becomes loss,
      what was loss becomes <I>profit</I>&quot; (p.17). In another passage we
      find the problem: &quot;A sixteen-year-old female slave cost thirty-two
      <I>nishkas; </I>how much will a twenty-year-old slave-girl cost?&quot;
      (p.618). Interest calculations follow (at the rate of 50 per cent. per
      month!); also problems for calculating all kinds of commercial
      transactions (p. 619), etc. The unknown quantities designated by x, y, x,
      in present-day algebra, were called by the Indians &quot;coin&quot; <I>(rupaka),
      </I>the positive quantities were &quot;assets&quot; (<I>dhana </I>or <I>sva</I>);
      the negative quantities, &quot;liabilities&quot; (<I>rina </I>or
      <I>kshaya</I>) (p.621). Architecture and its mathematical rules were here
      also enveloped in mystery, having a specific astronomic and divine
      significance. The measurement of fields, the construction of palaces and
      temples, the calculation of contents, were the moving impulse in Indian
      geometry. Among the ancient Chinese, the evolution of mathematics
      proceeded along the same general lines, with the class character of
      science, its monopoly, more sharply expressed (there were three sets of
      numerals, one for state officials, one for science, one for civilian
      merchants. In a collection of laws (<I>Tcheou ly</I>), we find the
      following mathematical offices: the hereditary dignity of court astronomer
      <I>(fong siang ski) </I>and court astrologer <I>(pao tshang shi); </I>followed
      by the head-geometer <I>(liong jin), </I>to whom was entrusted the laying
      out of the walls and palaces of cities, below him a special official for
      the measuring apparatus <I>(tu fang shi), </I>who performed measurements
      with an instrument called <I>to küei, </I>namely, a shadow
      indicator, making the necessary calculations, etc. (p.676).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is easy to conclude from the above: 1. that the
      content of science is given by the content of technology and economy; 2.
      that its development was determined among other things by the tools of
      scientific knowledge; 3. that the various social conditions now
      encouraged, now retarded progress; 4. that the method of scientific
      thought was determined by the economic structure of society (the
      religious, divinely mysterious character of ancient mathematics, in which
      even a <I>number </I>sometimes designated a divinity, is a reflection of
      the feudal-slaveholding order of society with its inaccessible ruler, its
      priestly officials, etc.); 5. that the class structure of society
      impressed its class stamp on mathematics (in part merely on the mode of
      thought, in part on the form of material interest, excluding ordinary
      mortals from the sacred mysteries). In modern times we find the same
      causal relations, but they are more complicated and, of course, different
      in form; the technology and the economic conditions have changed entirely.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><I>Religion and Philosophy. </I>Religion and philosophy are the next
      forms of the superstructure to which we shall devote our attention.</P>
    
    <P>The thoughts and observations accumulated by human society give rise to
      the need of grouping and classifying them; science has resulted from this
      need. But science began, at a very early stage, to be subdivided into
      various branches, and within these special sciences there proceeded an &quot;adaptation
      of thoughts to thoughts&quot;, <I>ie.</I>, a systematization. But, in
      addition, a need was felt for some thing that would hold together all
      these &quot;knowledges&quot; and &quot;errors&quot;, that would realize an
      equilibrium between them. Religion and general science had to provide this
      uniting principle; it is that which had to furnish the answers to the most
      abstract and general questions: as to the cause of all existence; the
      nature of the universe; whether the universe is as it seems, or otherwise;
      the nature of mind and matter; the possibility of a knowledge of the
      universe; the nature of truth; the ultimate causes of all phenomena; the
      nature of truth; ultimate causes of all phenomena; the existence of limits
      to human knowledge, the defining of these limits; and a host of similar
      questions. Of course, our answer to these questions will influence our
      conception of any specific phenomenon. If, for instance, all depends on
      the will of God, who guides the world according to his divine plan, all
      our knowledge must be arranged in teleological or theological order, and
      at certain epochs science actually assumed this form. All phenomena then
      required us to seek the so called &quot;hand of God&quot;, the divine
      purpose. But if the gods are not involved, if a causal relation is the
      only element of importance, our attitude toward the phenomena of the
      universe becomes quite different. If philosophy and religion, therefore,
      are the spectacles through which all facts are viewed at a certain stage
      in evolution, a study of the conditions <I>underlying </I>the
      construction of these &quot;spectacles&quot; is very important.</P>
    
    <P>As for religion, we already know that its &quot;essence&quot; is a &quot;faith&quot;
      in supernatural powers, in miraculous spirits; this &quot;faith&quot; may
      be in one or more such forces, may be crude, or more intangible and
      ethereal. This notion of &quot;spirit&quot;, &quot;soul&quot;, etc., was a
      reflection of the particular economic structure of society at the time
      when the &quot;eldest of the clan&quot; - and later, the patriarch - arose
      (in the patriarchate; the case is essentially the same in the
      matriarchate), in other words, when the division of labor led to the
      segregation of administrative work. The eldest of the clan, the guardian
      of its accumulated experience in production, administers, commands,
      outlines the plan of labor, represents the active &quot;creative&quot;
      principle, while the rest obey, execute commands, submit to the plan
      handed out by their superior, act in accordance with another's will. This
      mode of production became a pattern for the interpretation of all phases
      of existence, particularly man himself. Man was divided into &quot;body&quot;
      and &quot;spirit&quot;. The &quot;spirit&quot; guides the &quot;body&quot;,
      and is as much superior to the body as the organizer and administrator is
      superior to the simple executant. In one passage, Aristotle compares the
      soul with the master and the body with the slave. All the rest of the
      world began to be considered in accordance with the same scheme of things:
      behind each thing, man saw the &quot;spirit&quot; of this thing; all
      nature became animated with a &quot;spirit&quot;, a scientific conception
      which is known as &quot;animism&quot;, from the Latin <i>anima </i>(<i>&quot;soul</i>&quot;),
      or animus (<i>&quot;spirit</i>&quot;). This conception, once
      established, necessarily led to the origin of religion, beginning with the
      worship of ancestors, of the elders of the clan, of supervisors and
      organizers in general. Their &quot;spirits&quot; or &quot;souls&quot; were
      naturally considered to be the most intelligent, most experienced, most
      powerful spirits, capable of giving aid, and on whom all things depended.
      Here we already have a religion, showing in its origin that it also is a
      reflection of production relations (particularly those of master and
      servant) and the <i>political order of society </i>conditioned by them.
      The whole world was explained in accordance with the pattern used to
      explain life in society; in all its later history, religion shows
      alterations proceeding parallel with the alterations in the production
      relations and the social-political relations; in a society consisting of
      loosely connected clans, each with its own elders and princes, religion
      assumes the form of polytheism; should a centralized monarchy arise, it
      will be found paralleled in heaven, where a single God will mount the
      throne, as cruel as the ruler of the earth; the religion of a slaveholding
      commercial republic (for instance, the Athens of the Fifth Century B.C.)
      will show the Gods organized as a republic, even though the goddess of the
      victorious city, Pallas Athena, may be given unusual prominence. And,
      parallel with the hierarchy of officials found in any &quot;respectable&quot;
      state, we also find a corresponding organization of saints, angels, gods,
      etc., in heaven, arranged in accordance with their dignity, rank, and
      order.<sup class="anote"><a href="#14" name="14b">14)</a></sup>
      Furthermore, a division of labor is instituted among the gods, as among
      mundane superiors; one is made a specialist for military affairs (Mars in
      the Roman mythology, St. George or the Archangel Michael, the
      Archistrategus, in the Greek Catholic Church); another for commercial
      matters (Mercury); a third, for agriculture, etc. The parallel even
      extends to amusing details; for instance, among the Russian saints there
      are &quot;specialists&quot; (like the <i>spetses </i>in Soviet Russia)
      for horsebreeding (Frol and Lavr). Any relation of domination and
      subjection is paralleled by a religion reflecting this relation. As actual
      life presents cases of war, enslavement, and insurrection, so religion
      teaches that these also occur in the celestial spheres; devils, demons,
      princes of darkness, are merely a heavenly parallel to the hostile leaders
      seeking to destroy the state on earth; in heaven they attempt to undermine
      the Emperor, the Almighty, and subvert the entire celestial order.</p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">This theory of the origin of religion, which we accept
      absolutely, belongs, to A Bogdanov, and was first formulated in the
      Russian handbook: <i>Contributions to Social Psychology. </i>Later
      special investigations have entirely confirmed this conjecture, which is
      touched upon by H. Cunow in his book: <i>Ursprung der Religion and des
      Gottesglaubens, </i>Berlin, 1920. Cunow objects to the conception which
      would have religion emanate from the various observations of external
      nature, and rightly declares: &quot;We may indeed, since each conceptual
      image is determined by the conception at its basis (its sub-stratum),
      maintain in a certain sense that both the natural environment and the
      social life determine the religious ideology; but, aside from the fact
      that the view of nature is in turn largely dependent on the degree to
      which man has succeeded in technically utilizing the forces of nature in
      the production of his material life (Herr Cunow should have remembered
      this when he took up a discussion of the productive forces, <i>N. B</i>.),
      the natural conceptual image furnished only the <i>external adornments,
      </i>one might almost say, only the <i>local color for the religious
      system of thought</i>&quot; (p.20, my italics, <i>N. B</i>.). But Herr
      Cunow does not pursue this thought to its logical conclusion and falls a
      victim to the most incredible childishness. Thus, he states (p.24): &quot;All
      natural and semi-civilized races are naturally (!) dualists.&quot; This
      recalls Adam Smith's designation of &quot;exchange&quot; as an &quot;entirely
      natural&quot; property of man, or the explanation of the origin of science
      in man's innate &quot;tendency to causality&quot;. According to Cunow, the
      fact that man has both soul and body is &quot;fortified&quot; by
      dream-visions and the trance (fainting) condition (something apparently,
      leaves the body, later returning to it). But only that which is can be &quot;fortified&quot;.
      Perhaps <i>death </i>is a phenomenon calling forth the notion of a &quot;soul&quot;
      separate from the &quot;body&quot;. But Cunow himself gives us examples
      (pp.22, 23) of savages who do not understand the necessity of natural
      death, in fact, many tribes (John Fraser reports this of the Australians
      in New South Wales) ascribe death itself to &quot;the mysterious
      malignance of an evil spirit&quot; (p.23). In other words, this explains
      nothing at all. (We may mention in passing that M. N. Pokrovsky derives
      religion from the fear of death, from those departed, etc. But suppose
      even the conception that all men are mortal is lacking? It is obvious that
      Pokrovsky considers &quot;natural&quot; or primitive what is really a
      historical category, historical in its origin.) In Cunow's mind, religion
      evolves as follows: Beginnings of a spirit worship, then totem worship
      (totems are the birds, animals, plants, that were once the coats of arms
      of the tribes) and ancestor worship. But in almost all of the examples
      mentioned by Cunow, his &quot;most primitive&quot; spirits are the spirits
      of ancestors. In his chapter on &quot;the beginnings of spirit worship&quot;,
      Cunow writes: &quot;Only the spirits of close relations or, at any rate,
      of members of the same horde are regarded as well disposed. And not always
      even these; the spirits of the dead of strange hordes and tribes are all
      considered as hostile&quot; (pp.39, 40). The name &quot;Father&quot; is
      given to the spirit of either parent (p.40), to that of grandfather and
      great-grandfather (p.41), to any spirit at all (p.41), etc. Cunow gets
      nowhere by this method. On p.6 he accepts the formula that religious
      impressions are called forth by the &quot;impressions . . . of <i>social
      life&quot; </i>(my italics, <i>N. B.). </i>But on p.17 he has
      already ceased to speak of the social nature of the spirit, now speaking
      of &quot;its own nature, its own origin, growth and decay, <i>particularly
      death&quot; </i>(Cunow's italics). But Cunow will surely not dare term
      birth and death as specifically social phenomena! In reality, what is true
      of external nature is also true of the biological nature of man: the
      impressions of all these phenomena, (death, sleep, trance, as well as
      thunderstorms, earthquakes, will-of-the-wisps, the sun, etc.) furnish a
      partial material out of which the total is built up from the point of view
      of dualism; a dualism by no means innate, but arising from the fundamental
      conditions of <i>social life.</i></font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">We are giving so much attention to Cunow because his
      book - on the whole quite valuable, is almost the only Marxian work on the
      history of religion. Eduard Meyer (<i>ibid</i>., p.87) considers the
      fundamental cause for the origin of religion to lie in the direct presence
      of a &quot;causality instinct&quot; and an (also &quot;directly given&quot;!)
      dualism; man experiences within himself two parallel sets of phenomena in
      causal relation with each other.: on the one hand, phenomena of
      consciousness (feeling, conceiving, volition), on the other hand, bodily
      movements, arbitrary actions, resulting from the above. <i>&quot;The
      dualism of body and soul is therefore a primitive experience, and not the
      product of reflection, of however primitive a nature&quot;. </i>This
      marvelous theory &quot;on the one hand&quot; flies in the face of the
      facts and &quot;on the other hand&quot; explains nothing: it contents
      itself with a description of that which requires explanation. Professor
      Achelis comes closer to a correct understanding of the matter (<i>Soziologie,
      </i>in <i>Sammlung Göschen, </i>Leipzig, 1899, pp.85 <i>et seq</i>.);
      he considers religious conceptions to be &quot;merely a mirror of
      social-political conceptions and institutions&quot; (p.91). Even death was
      able to arouse the attention of the savage, only in <i>society </i>(p.97;
      Achelis is closer to the truth here than Cunow). All the differentiations
      in political power and standing, shown by the various concrete forms of
      organization, are here found faithfully reflected; the chieftains and
      kings among men are paralleled by the great gods among the lesser spirits,
      the imposing figure of a more or less generally recognized ruler
      predominates - quite on the earthly pattern - in the motley crowd of
      different gods&quot; (p.96). But Achelis' excellent (because it is
      Marxian) chapter on religion does not prevent him from shamefully
      distorting Marx, from never mentioning him by name, and from taking off
      his hat to religion! Here we are obviously dealing with a contradiction
      between the evolution of science and the interests of the bourgeoisie.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">We shall now furnish examples for the correctness of
      the Marxian standpoint. For the ancient Babylonians (two or three thousand
      years before Christ), &quot;heaven is a prototype of earth, everything
      earthly is created in accordance with the heavenly pattern, an
      indissoluble bond exists between the two&quot; (Professor B. A. Turayev:
      <i>History of the Ancient Orient</i>, vol. i, p.124, in Russian). The
      gods are the protectors (spirits) of individuals (&quot;God&quot;, &quot;My
      God&quot;, are equivalent to our &quot;patron saints&quot;), of streets,
      cities, regions, etc. &quot;The divinity is indissolubly connected with
      the destinies of its city . . its magnitude grew with the expansion of the
      city territory, if the inhabitants annexed other cities, the divinities of
      the subject peoples were subjected to the home divinity; on the contrary,
      the removal of a divine image from the city and the destruction of its
      temple were equivalent to the political destruction of the city&quot;
      (p.124.). By the side of the great gods (Anu, Enlil, Ea, Sin, Shamash,
      etc.), there are also a number of smaller spirits, of celestial (<i>ihihi</i>)
      and terrestrial spirits (<i>anunaki). </i>Parallel with the formation of
      the Babylonian monarchy proceeds that of the celestial monarchy: &quot;The
      rise of Babylon carried in its wake certain changes in its Pantheon. The
      god of Babylon had to take the place of honor. Such a god was Marduk,
      whose name was of Sumerian origin. He was the god of the sun in
      springtime. The dynasty of Hammurabi (a Babylonian king whose code of laws
      has been found in excavations on the site of ancient Babylon, N. B.)
      elevated him into a supreme god&quot; (p.127). The following &quot;evolution&quot;
      took place in the case of the other great gods: &quot;Enlil, king of
      heaven and earth, handed Marduk &quot; the domination over the four lands
      of the world and his name as ruler of these lands.&quot; As for Ea, Marduk
      was proclaimed his first-born son, to whom his father had graciously ceded
      his rights and his power, his role in the creation of the world (p.127).
      When the Babylonian monarchy, had struck firm root, there &quot;gradually
      arose&quot; the conception of unified power, manifesting itself in
      countless visible forms, and accordingly bearing countless different
      names. The priests began to maintain that the other great gods were merely
      manifestations of Marduk. &quot;Ninib is Marduk of Strength, Nergal is
      Marduk of Battle, Enlil is Marduk of Might and Dominion&quot; (p.129).
      Here is a fragment of a hymn of prayer to the god Sin, excellently
      characterizing the monarchic construction of the celestial power: &quot;Lord,
      ruler of the gods, sole great lord in heaven and on earth . . Thou who
      hast created the earth, founded the temples and given them names, Father,
      begetter of gods and men &quot; mighty leader, whose mysterious depth has
      been sounded by no god &quot; Father, Creator of all beings; Ruler, thou
      who desirest the destinies of heaven and earth, whose bidding is
      inexorable, who providest warmth and cold, who rulest living things, what
      god is like unto thee? Who is great in Heaven? Thou alone; and on earth
      who is great? When thy word resounds in the heavens, the ihihi fall into
      the dust, when it resounds on earth the anunaki kiss the dust . . . Ruler
      ! In thy rule on heaven and earth, none is like unto thee among the gods, 
      thy brethren&quot;, etc. (quoted from B. Turayev, <i>ibid</i>., p.144).
      Sin is here depicted almost as a celestial emperor, before whom all
      appropriate ceremonies are carried out (bending the knee, kissing the
      ground, etc.). It is self-evident that the official religion always has
      expressed chiefly the idea of the <i>ruling </i>class, as we may note
      even in little things. For instance, in the feudal period, when warlike
      virtues were esteemed highest, and the ruling class, representing
      particularly the warlike great landlords, only those feel at home in the
      hereafter who have fallen in battle, while those &quot;for whose gifts in
      the hereafter no one can have much concern&quot;, namely, the poor, fare
      but poorly.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">Max Weber furnishes us with a mass of valuable material
      concerning the religion of the ancient East Indians, in his interesting
      investigations on the economic morality of the world religions (<i>ibid</i>.,
      vol. ii,<i> Hinduismus and Buddhismus</i>). Here the economic and
      vocational stratification of society into classes directly assumes the
      form of castes, later confirmed by religion. According to the old legal
      code of Manu, the four chief castes are - the Brahmans (priests, scholars,
      noble literati), Kshatryas (noble knights, warriors), Vaiçias
      (farmers, later also usurers and merchants), and Sudras (slaves, artisans,
      etc.). A caste is thus &quot;always essentially a purely social,
      eventually a vocational subdivision of the social community&quot; (p.34).
      The Brahmans and Kshatryas control everything and everybody. The Vaiçias
      are considered only as a &quot;pure&quot; caste, worthy of handing food or
      water to the Brahmans. The Sudras are divided into &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;impure&quot;;
      a noble will accept no water from the latter; no barber may cut the nails
      of their feet, etc. Below the impure Sudras there are also other &quot;impure&quot;
      castes; some may not enter any temples; others are so &quot;impure&quot;
      that even to touch them is defiling; in some cases approaching within
      sixty feet of such a person is an &quot;impurity&quot; for a noble or
      other &quot;pure&quot; person. Food is rendered &quot;impure&quot; by the
      mere glance of the &quot;impure&quot;, etc. (p.46); even the excrement of
      a Brahman may have religious significance (p.62). Thousands of rulers and
      religious ceremonies support the existing order. Kings and rulers are
      descended from the Kshatryas; the aristocratic nature of the state extends
      also to the economic life (price-fixing, taxes in kind, national
      storehouses), with a monstrous bureaucratic mechanism (p.69). Max Weber
      considers the following as the two fundamental religious ideas growing out
      of this soil (pp.117-121): the idea of transmigration (<i>samsara</i>)
      and the doctrine of reward and punishment (<i>karma</i>). All acts
      of men are recorded; each has his account, his good and evil actions being
      balanced: after death, he will be reincarnated in the form to which the
      balance-sheet of his actions, at the moment of his death, entitles him. He
      may come to life again as a king, as a Brahman; he may be transformed into
      a worm in the entrails of a dog. The basis of the most important virtues
      is the observance of the caste order. The slaves, the impure, must know
      their place. He who is unfailing, who never forgets his &quot;impurity&quot;,
      may perhaps in the life after death become a noble; but on earth the caste
      system is not to be tampered with. &quot;Accidents of birth&quot; do not
      exist; the individual is born into the caste which is his by reason of his
      conduct in an earlier life (p.120). This doctrine expresses most
      distinctly the social order and the interests of the ruling classes, but
      we find this reflection even earlier. For instance, the gods of the Vedas
      (ancient sacred hymns) &quot;are functional and heroic gods of a type
      externally similar to those in Homer, and the heroes of the Vedic period
      are warlike kings dwelling in mountain fastnesses and fighting in
      chariots, having retinues . . . and with . . . a predominantly
      cattle-breeding peasantry&quot; (p.29). The characteristic gods are &quot;Indra,
      god of thunderstorms and therefore (like Yahveh) a warlike and heroic god
      of impetuous character . . and Varuna, the wise, all-seeing functional god
      of the eternal order, particularly the legal order&quot; . . . (p.29). It
      should be remembered that the heavens were originally destined only for
      the Brahmans and Kshatryas-(<i>cf</i>. p.119). Alongside of the official
      religion of the ruling classes, there was also a religion of the people,
      often including, among other things, sexual manipulations. The Vedas
      designate one of these cults as an &quot;evil custom of the <i>subjected
      ones</i>&quot;. We are, therefore, dealing with class religions.
      For instance, here is the description of the religious split in Southern
      India (reminding one somewhat of the schism in the Russian Church): a
      portion of the <i>lower castes </i>and the <i>royal artisans, </i>coming
      from other parts, there opposed reglementation by the Brahmans, and thus
      arose the still existing schism of the Valan-gai and the Iden-gai, the
      castes &quot;to the right&quot; and &quot;to the left&quot; (p.324). Among
      the ancient Greeks, the feudal order, and later the slave order, were
      reflected in heaven, Zeus being the chief of all the gods, Demeter the
      goddess of agriculture, Hermes, the god of trade and intercourse, Hellos
      the god of the liberal professions (arts).</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">The class struggle proceeded along these lines. In
      Athens, in the Fifth Century (period of highest culture and incipient
      decay), religion was one of the chief weapons of the ruling class of the
      commercial &quot;democracy&quot;. &quot;In the opinion of Sophocles (one
      of the &quot;orthodox&quot; poets of the time, N. B.), the entire world
      will perish if faith ceases, for all the moral and state regulations,
      according to Sophocles, depend on the will of the gods&quot; (Eduard
      Meyer: <i>Geschichte des Altertums, </i>vol. iv, p.140). The opposition
      element of the nobility and the declassed strata make use of a criticism
      of religion in order to criticize the existing order. The merchant
      democracy imposes the death penalty for expressions of doubt as to the
      existence of the gods.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">The ancient Slavs present the same picture. Ancestor
      worship, worship of tribal gods, of house-gods, of vocational gods, are
      found here also. The most important national god was that of the traders
      and noble warriors, simultaneously also god of thunder: Perim. Paradise
      was reserved for departed princes and their retinue; there was no place
      for ordinary mortals (M. N. Nikolsky: <i>Primitive Religious Faith and
      the Origin of Christianity, </i>in Pokrovsky's <i>History of Russia </i>vol.
      i, in Russian; Nikolsky himself finds the origin of religion in the fear
      of the departed, etc.). Let us now consider the modern forms of the
      Christian religion. The Russian &quot;Orthodox&quot; Church was a precise
      reflection of Byzantine-Muscovite absolutism. God is the emperor; the
      Mother of God the empress; St. Nicholas the Wonder-Worker and the other
      popular saints are his ministers of state. Under them is an entire nation
      of officials (angels, archangels, cherubim, seraphim, etc.). Due division
      of labor exists between these heavenly courtiers. Saint Michael is
      Commander-in-Chief; the Mother of God is first lady of the court; Saint
      Nicholas is principally the god of fruitfulness of the soil; Saint
      Pantelemon is a sort of medicine-man; the victorious Saint George is the
      divine warrior; etc. The more distinguished saints have finer honors:
      better halos, fairer raiment, sacrifices. etc. The class struggle
      repeatedly assumed religious forms in Russia (schisms; the sects of the
      Stundists, the Flagellants, Molokans, etc.). We cannot pursue this subject
      here, but merely point out that the Russian designations for divinity 
      distinctly indicate the true origin of these precise notions of godhood: &quot;Lord&quot;
      (<i>Gospod</i>) is practically the same as <i>gospodin </i>(&quot;master&quot;);
      &quot;God&quot; (<i>Bog</i>) has the same root as <i>bogaty </i>(&quot;rich&quot;).
      Ruler, heavenly father, judge, father, etc., such are the names of the
      feudal-noble monarch who looks upon the people as his slaves. Absolutism
      had good reason to be content with the &quot;Orthodox&quot; Church.</font></p>
    
    <p>Religion, as a super-structure, consists not only of a system <i>of
      ideas </i>that have been fitted into a pattern, but like science it also
      has a corresponding <i>personal </i>organization (ecclesiastical
      organization) and a system of special methods and rules in the worship
      <i>of </i>God (the &quot;services&quot;: &quot;liturgy&quot;, high mass,
      low mass, with many ceremonials, conjurations, magic formulas and a great
      number of unintelligible magic incantations), the god's cult.</p>
    
    <p>This phase of the religious superstructure is also indissolubly bound up
      with the course of social life. &quot;The Church has at every epoch
      reproduced and repeated contemporary society within itself, in its
      economic and cultural traits. In the period of the feudal magnates, the
      church was a feudal magnate, while democratic elements and the forms of
      financial economy were expressed by the Church in the period of the rise
      of the cities&quot;, etc.<sup class="anote"><a href="#15" name="15b">15)</a></sup>
      The original form of the professional clergyman was the sorcerer,
      mountebank, clairvoyant, prophet, soothsayer, etc., whom Eduard Meyer
      considers as the earliest social classes known to us. In general, the
      highest class of priests were a portion of the ruling class, reflecting
      its division of labor, some of the rulers becoming military leaders,
      others priests, others legislators, etc. It does not surprise us to find
      the Church &quot;reproducing and repeating contemporary society&quot;.</p>
    
    <p>The dominant church also constitutes an economic organization whose
      economic conditions are a portion of the general economic conditions of
      society as a whole. &quot;Thus, we learn from the legal code of laws of
      Hammurabi, king of Babylonia, that the Temple of the god Shamash executed
      many transactions and usually collected 20 per cent. interest, the rate
      rising to 33 per cent. and even to 40 per cent. in the case of loans
      on grain.<sup class="anote"><a href="#16" name="16b">16)</a></sup> In
      the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church was a veritable feudal kingdom
      with a tremendous economic system, imposts and taxes (the so called &quot;tithes&quot;)
      and administrative mechanism. Similarly, the monasteries and <i>lavras
      </i>(groups of monasteries) in Russia accumulated immense wealth;
      characteristically enough, the magnificent edifice of the Moscow Stock
      Exchange belonged to the Troitsa-Sergius Lavra. The Church, in addition to
      serving as a pacifier of the masses, restraining them from violations of
      the established order of things, itself was and still is a portion of the
      exploiting machinery, constructed according to the same general plan as
      the larger exploiting society.</p>
    
    <p>Society, except in its initial stage, was always <i>class</i> society;
      its production relations were those of domination and submission; its
      political system was a reflection and an expression of this condition. Its
      religion justified this condition and secured its acceptance by the
      masses, sometimes by very skilful means (as in the case of the Hindoo
      doctrine of reincarnation and compensation, discussed .above). But this
      conciliation did not always last; the oppressed classes, unable to free
      themselves entirely from the religious mode of thought, would set up their
      own religion in opposition to the orthodox religion; so called &quot;heresies&quot;
      arose in opposition to the orthodox Church doctrine; we now have an
      official Church and also special religious groups of &quot;dissenters&quot;,
      sometimes organized illegally and conspiratively, with priests and
      prophets of their own, who are also their political leaders.</p>
    
    <p>A short time ago, such a view of religion and the church would have been
      considered as downright blasphemy, but even bourgeois investigators who
      have made a special study of the subject now accept this view. One of the
      best modern students of religion, Max Weber, arrives at the following
      conclusion with regard to Asiatic religions: &quot;On the whole we observe
      everywhere the same group of cults, schools, sects, orders of all kinds,
      which is also characteristic of occidental antiquity. Of course, the
      competing tendencies were not looked upon with equal favor by the
      temporary majority in the ruling classes, or by the political powers.
      There were orthodox and heterodox persons, the former including a number
      of more or less legitimate schools, orders, and sects. Particularly
      important for us is the observation that they were distinguished from each
      other socially. In the first place, . . . according to the strata of
      society in which they existed; in the second place, however, . . . .
      according to the species of salvation ministered to the various strata of
      their adherents. We find the former case, where, for instance, an upper
      social class that rigidly condemns the entire religion of redemption is
      opposed by popular soteriologists <sup class="anote"><a href="#17" name="17b">17)</a></sup>
      among the masses, as was typical of China. But we also find the various
      social strata following different forms of soteriology.&quot;
      <sup class="anote"><a href="#18" name="18b">18)</a></sup> As an example
      of the class struggle waged under a religious flag, we may take the so
      called (Protestant) Reformation, the first onslaught of certain classes on
      feudal rule and its expression in Western Europe, the Roman Catholic
      Church. The ruling princes all sided with the Pope; the petty provincial
      nobility and the bourgeoisie with the moderates, headed by Luther; the
      artisans, semi-proletarians and a portion of the peasants joined the
      extreme sects (Anabaptists, etc., sometimes not without an element of
      communism). The religious struggle, slogans, groups of adherents, of the
      various tendencies were a precise reflection of the struggle, the
      aspirations, and the alignments in the socialpolitical field.</p>
    
    <p>The religious superstructure is thus determined by the material
      conditions of human existence; its nucleus is the reflection of the
      social-political order of society. Other ideas group themselves about this
      nucleus, but their simple axis remains the social structure as transferred
      to the invisible world, and furthermore, as viewed from a specific class
      standpoint. &quot;Soul&quot; is here also a function of social &quot;matter&quot;.</p>
    
    <p>The following objection might be raised in the case of capitalist
      society: while religion continues to exist in that society-throughout
      Europe in the form of monotheism - the capitalist social order has
      different forms of bourgeois domination in politics (monarchy, republic).,
      and while production relations are based on domination and submission,
      they are not monarchic in character; the capitalist is a monarch in his
      own factory, but in society the class of capitalists usually does not
      operate through a single person. The Marxian theory affords, however, the
      only possible explanation of the religious forms of our day; the apparent
      contradiction above mentioned is easily disposed of.</p>
    
    <p>In feudal society, the monarchs and princes and officials under them had
      control of the semi-natural economy (economy in kind) but under capitalism
      we have a powerful, new, impersonal regulator, of elemental nature: the
      market, with its incalculable caprices, exalting some and destroying the
      lives of others, playing with men as a blind, irrational inscrutable
      force. &quot;What is our life? A trifle; let the luckless dog bemoan his
      lot,&quot; says the poet; divinity now distributes the lots. The Greeks
      and Romans already had their Parcae, their Moira, their Ananke (&quot;necessity&quot;),
      a compulsory force superior even to the gods; this conception was
      associated with the growth of exchange relations and the consequent
      commercial wars which endangered the very existence of Greece. The gods
      (the individual God also) have not always been disembodied spirits; they
      were fond of eating and drinking, they cohabited with women, assuming the
      form of a dove for the purpose, in the case of the &quot;Holy Ghost&quot;.
      (In Greece, where homosexual practices were 'frequent, Zeus adopted the
      shape of an eagle in his intercourse with the boy Ganymede.) But the
      economic evolution which brought about an economy based on exchange and
      undermined the feudal political system, not only plucked from the god his
      eagle's and dove's feathers, but deprived him of his beard, his mustaches,
      and the other attributes of his previous incarnations. The pious bourgeois
      now believes in God as an unknown, unknowable, divine power on which all
      things depend, but with no external relation with man: the divinity is a
      spirit, not a crude aboriginal form. The condition may be stated as
      follows: economy is characterized, on the one hand by a relation of
      domination and submission, and on the other hand by unorganized exchanged
      relations; the preservation of religion at all is due to the former
      circumstance, while the latter explains the meagre and fleshless character
      of God today.</p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">But we must not forget that we are here considering
      only the fun<i>damental </i>ideas of religion. The subsidiary notions
      must always be explained from the peculiar conditions of development.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">In concluding our consideration of religion, we must
      not fail to point out that the proletariat - holding our view of religion
      - is faced with the necessity of <i>actively combating it. </i>Hermann
      Gorter, in his book <i>Der historische Materialismus, </i>not only
      departs from philosophical materialism, but takes a purely petty bourgeois
      and opportunistic view of the attitude which would regard religion as
      every man's private affair. His view of this attitude is that it is
      equivalent to our paying no attention to religion, which will disappear of
      itself. But nothing &quot;disappears of itself&quot; in society; as early
      as in the days of Marx, we find the latter, in a brilliant essay (<i>Critique
      of the Goths Program</i>),<sup class="anote"><a href="#19" name="19b">19)</a></sup>
      poking fun at the Gorter view of &quot;religion a private matter&quot;.
      Marx considers this slogan to mean merely that the workers must demand of
      the bourgeois state that it shall not poke its police nose into things
      that do not concern it; but it by no means signifies that the workers are
      to be &quot;tolerant&quot; of all the remnants of the wretched past, of
      all the powers of reaction. We may not regard Gorter's point of view on
      this subject as at all revolutionary or communist; it is a genuinely
      Social-Democratic point of view.</font></p>
    
    <p>We now turn our attention to <i>Philosophy, </i>which is a meditation
      on the most abstract questions, a generalization of all knowledge, a
      science of sciences. When the sciences had not yet developed or been
      differentiated from each other, philosophy and religion (from which it had
      not yet parted company) also embraced purely scientific questions,
      including that fragmentary knowledge of nature and man that was available
      at the time. But even after the various sciences began to exist
      independently, philosophy still retained a field of its own, namely, the
      common element of all the sciences and particularly the subject of man's
      knowledge and of its relation to the world, etc. Philosophy must
      coordinate science in spite of the tatter's manifold subdivision; must
      furnish a common framework for all the things that are known, serving as a
      foundation to the total view of life (<i>Weltauffassung</i>). At the
      beginning of this book, we discussed the question of causality and
      teleology, which is not specifically a question of physics, or political
      economy, or philology, or statistics, but a universal concern of all the
      sciences: a philosophical question; similar is the question of the
      relation between &quot;mind&quot; and &quot;matter&quot;, in other words, &quot;thought&quot;
      and &quot;being&quot;. The individual sciences do not give special
      attention to this question, but it concerns them all, as do also tech
      questions as: do our senses correctly reflect the outer world? does this
      world exist as such? what is truth? are there limits, or not, to our
      knowledge? etc. As each science classifies and systematizes the ideas
      connected with its domain, so philosophy continues to assemble and
      systematize our total knowledge from a single point of view, thus creating
      an orderly structure of the whole. Philosophy might therefore be said to
      occupy the highest place in the human spirit and it is more difficult to
      trace its earthly and material origin than in the case of other subjects.
      Yet here again we may ascertain the same basic law of nature: the final
      dependence of philosophy on the technical evolution of society, the level
      attained by the productive forces. Inevitably, we here encounter a
      complicated form of such dependence, for philosophy does not issue forth
      directly from technology, being separated from the latter by a number of
      links. A few examples will make this clear. We have stated that philosophy
      systematizes knowledge, the general results of the individual sciences; it
      therefore is directly conditioned by the stage at which these sciences
      stand; if for any cause the social sciences develop, philosophy will shade
      off in that direction; but if, at the given time, the natural sciences
      engage the general attention, the fundamental note of philosophy will be
      quite different. These results are produced by the social psychology, the
      general mental attitude, prevailing in the given time and place, which is
      in turn an expression of the alignment of classes, the conditions of their
      existence; these &quot;conditions of existence in general&quot; are
      governed by the situation of the classes in the social economy, and the
      latter is the result of the given level of the productive forces. We thus
      find a number of links interposed between the productive forces
      (technology) and philosophy.</p>
    
    <p>If a certain philosophic doctrine is gloomy in its nature (a pessimistic
      philosophy), or asserts the impossibility of all knowledge, or the vanity
      of all things, their frail and transitory nature, we must look for an
      explanation to the current psychology from which such a philosophy is
      born. Detailed investigation will show that such gloomy thoughts do not
      arise independently, but that they must express a defeat of some section
      or class of society, or of all classes of society; there seems to be no
      escape, the love of life has been lost; a gloomy philosophy is the product
      of this mood. Or, suppose a certain society is involved in a passionate
      struggle between the classes and their parties; this condition will be
      reflected in the philosophy of the period, for man does not lead a double
      life: it is the same man or the same class that is engaged in the
      political struggle and cogitating on the &quot;final cause&quot; of
      things. Such social struggles will place their stamp on the psychology and
      be reflected in the &quot;sublimest&quot; constructions. Or, if we assume
      a society whose tempo has become excessively slow: life creeping along
      monotonously day by day; today another yesterday, tomorrow another today,
      etc.; tradition, routine, time-honored precedent, control all things; no
      changes in technology, in social life, in science; men die, other men are
      born, with thoughts precisely like those of their predecessors, etc. Such
      a rigidity of a whole society will necessarily cause its philosophy to be 
      based in general on the notion of immutability, of permanence. The causal
      chain may be traced back as follows: a philosophy of inertia; a science of
      inertia; a social psychology of inertia; a technology of inertia. Examples
      might be multiplied, but we consider that the ultimate dependence of
      philosophy on the social economy and technology has been proved.</p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">The entire history of philosophic thought will support
      the above.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">In ancient Greece, usually considered the classic home
      of philosophy, the earliest philosophical systems arose in the Ionic
      commercial cities. These cities lay on the great maritime routes between
      Asia Minor and Europe; the meshes of economic relations with Egypt also
      centered here. More than anywhere else in the world as then known (Sixth
      and Fifth Centuries, B.C.), trade, artisan work, and slave industry -
      particularly trade - were developed here. Together with economic
      intercourse with other countries, there was an exchange of ideas,
      influence of Babylon, Egypt; &quot;cultural life&quot; flourished. We have
      the beginnings o£ the natural sciences, astronomy, geometry,
      arithmetic, medicine. On this basis, the first philosophical systems also
      grew up: so called natural philosophy, i.e., a philosophy connected with
      the natural sciences, its task being to find the natural basis of all
      being. The Ionic school (Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, and their
      disciples) sought the unity of matter now in water, now in air, now in
      infinity, etc. In addition to their observations on the &quot;essence of
      things&quot;, we find many scientific observations among these
      philosophers; Anaximander, for example, devised a geographical map that
      remained in use for some time. In the Ionic school, philosophical thought
      was not yet separated from scientific observations connected with
      practice. We then find a growth of wealth, its accumulation, an increase
      of slave labor, of parasitism in the higher classes of society;
      simultaneously, an increased contempt for labor, for the life of the
      worker, for production, for a direct engaging in trade (not through
      employees); all this retarded the development of scientific technical
      thought, transforming philosophy into a thoroughly unworldly &quot;speculation&quot;.
      But it does not follow that philosophy therefore &quot;developed out of
      itself&quot;; it continued to be shaped and conditioned by the social
      life. For instance, let us consider the philosophy of one of the greatest
      Greek philosophers, Heraclitus of Ephesus; he was born in a rich
      commercial city which had passed through many tribulations (wars, civil
      wars, etc.). &quot;In the Era of Tyrants, Ephesus was as much torn by
      internal dissension as any other Ionic city&quot; (Edward Meyer, <i>ibid.,
      </i>p.216). The commercial aristocracy had struck deep roots here and was
      politically dominant over the agrarian aristocracy. Heraclitus was of an
      old noble family, which had retained feudal-royal traditions, &quot;and he
      was, if not a partisan of the aristocrats, yet a fanatical opponent of the
      democracy, of rule by the blind mob&quot; (p.217). Being a
      counter-revolutionary, he shunned politics himself, and he even expounded
      his philosophy in a particularly obscure, semi-conspirative language. &quot;One
      is worth tens of thousands for me, if he is the best one,&quot; he wrote. &quot;What
      manner of sense and reason have they (the present rulers, <i>N. B</i>.)?
      They run after minstrels and permit the mob to teach them, since they know
      not that most men are evil and few good. Rather than all other things, the
      best choose a single thing, namely, eternal fame among mortals; but the
      mob feed themselves like cattle&quot; (p.218). It is to this principle of
      the persecuted aristocracy of birth that we must trace the philosophy of
      Heraclitus, born among turbulent transformations and dissensions. Society,
      torn by many conflicts, nevertheless exists as a whole, with all its
      contrasts and confusions. Such is the universe also. The essence of each
      thing consists in the fact that it is a whole and not a whole, concordant
      and discordant, constructive and destructive, one consisting of all and 
      all of one . . . . It is precisely in these contrasts that we have the
      unity, the &quot;essence of things&quot; (p.220). It is folly to speak of
      peace when there is no peace; one cannot have peace when the enemy
      prevails. Therefore: &quot;War is Father and King (!) of all things, he
      has made some men gods, others men, some slaves, others free men.&quot; &quot;Homer,
      who wished to see struggle (<i>eris</i>) eliminated from among gods and
      men, was not aware that he was thus renouncing all new birth&quot;
      (p.220). It is absurd to speak of peace when all is in commotion and
      change. As a matter of fact, there is nothing rigid and immutable. &quot;We
      cannot step into the same river, for ever different water flows along.&quot;
      We hear it said everywhere that. the present order is good, but truth is
      relative. &quot;The ocean is the purest and the impurest water, potable
      and beneficent for fishes, non-potable and ruinous for men&quot; (p.220).
      It matters not that merchants and democratic upstarts now rule the city;
      we must not regard only the surface of things, but must penetrate below
      the surface: &quot;The sense is deceived; even the eye, a better witness
      than the ear&quot; (p.219). Changes are constantly maturing in life; what
      exists must perish. &quot;Fire lives through the death of Earth, Air
      through the death of Fire; Water lives through the death of Air, Earth
      through the death of Water.&quot; Not only are the classes constantly
      succeeding one another, but social things also are constantly changing
      place. <i>&quot;Everything is exchanged against fire, and fire against
      everything, as commodities against gold and gold against commodities</i>&quot;
      (p.221). The essence of society is this substance of gold, which can
      purchase everything; the omnipresent and impenetrable power of gold.
      Therefore, Fire, the incarnation of this force, is the essence of things,
      the life-giving force, from which all else emanates. &quot;The life spirit
      also, the soul, is Fire and warmth.&quot; Market, competition, war, are
      elemental in nature; they are a compulsory and omnipotent fate. Therefore
      God also is not a human being with curly hair, but a fleshless, inevitable
      universal law; &quot;the predestined compulsion of fate (eimarmeun
      auaukh), imposing its eternal regulations, its `measures' on all things,
      which they may not exceed without falling forfeit to the Erynnyes, the
      hand maidens of justice.&quot; But divinity, reason, Logos, fate, ruling
      the world, will ultimately reestablish justice, which has been crushed to
      earth; the day of judgment will come when &quot;Fire will fall upon all
      things and seize and judge them.&quot; &quot;Dike (Justice) will take hold
      of the architects and witnesses of falsehood&quot; (p.222).</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">We can thus see the factors of the social life of his
      times peering through the philosophy of Heraclitus, woven in a peculiar
      pattern: the nature of the economy developing under the banner of gold,
      the class struggle, the aristocracy as an opposition party, the hope for a
      better future, words of encouragement, faith in victory, a support for
      this faith in the fact that all things are changing, the assumption of an
      impersonal destiny and a mysterious Reason ruling the world - these
      reflections of the laws of a commercial world, with competition and
      warfare, rejecting productive labor; the aristocrats by birth, hating the
      mob; the traditions of the nobility and the feudal warrior caste, etc.,
      etc, These are the social roots of Heraclitus' philosophical
      constructions. Quite characteristically, while Heraclitus, a member of the
      opposition and representing the aristocracy, and therefore not interested
      in preserving the existing order of things, was defending the principle of
      change, of contradictions, of struggle, of dynamics, the philosophers of
      the other - the ruling-school - were with equal vigor defending the
      principle of immutability and permanence. The greatest of these
      philosophers was Parmenides. Anaxagoras, a close associate of the leader
      of the Athenian commercial democracy in the Fifth Century, Pericles, and
      the official state philosopher of Athens, so to speak, made a very
      ingenious attempt to shift the center of gravity of this passionate
      philosophical dispute. &quot;The Hellenes,&quot; he taught, &quot;have no
      right to speak of rising and passing away, for existing things clearly
      show that what is present now is produced by mixture and elimination&quot;
      (Eduard Meyer, <i>ibid</i>., p.235). In other words, Aiiaxagoras
      represents the point of view of gradual evolution; which is precisely what
      we should expect from the social position of his class. Anaxagoras, by the
      way, among his other ideas, also did much to advance the atomic theory.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">We cannot dwell in detail here on Greek philosophy. It
      was manifestly incapable of finding a solution by making it up of whole
      cloth and elaborating intangible impressions of social life, which was
      meanwhile becoming more and more confused. The extremely complicated
      struggle and the very restless condition of the leading cities produced
      numerous currents, disputes, and criticisms; the social ties, standards,
      and traditional morals were falling into decay. Men &quot;were becoming
      confused&quot;. Parallel with this tendency, the whole of philosophy
      accomplished a sudden shift in the direction of a so called practical
      philosophy, <i>i.e., </i>considerations concerning the nature of man,
      morality, etc. Instead of investigating the essence of the universe,
      attention began now to be given to the essence of man, of standards of
      conduct, of duty, of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;; on the one
      hand we have the sophists, subjecting everything to their criticism, on
      the other hand Socrates. We have already mentioned, at the beginning of
      this book, the greatest philosopher of slaveholding antiquity, a man of
      outspoken &quot;Black Hundred&quot; tendencies, Plato, with his perfected
      system of philosophical idealism, incorporating, at one and the same time,
      pure reason and the Good as well as the big stick for the slaves. We may
      take another example, from the period of the decay of the Roman Empire,
      simultaneously a period of decay of the entire ancient Mediterranean
      civilization. The cities grew with tremendous rapidity; commodities were
      accumulated by plundering colonies and exploiting slaves; the ruling class
       was absolutely parasitic, as were also the great numbers of free <i>lumpenproletariat,
      </i>corrupted by state alms; the slaves were oppressed as never before;
      such, in broad outline, is the internal situation. Seneca, a philosopher
      of the Stoic school, a rich man, imparts the philosophy of life to his
      friend Lucilius: &quot;What is there that can tempt you away from death?
      You have tasted all the enjoyments that might make you hesitate; none of
      them are strange to you; you have had your fill of all. You know the taste
      of wine and of honey; is it not a matter of indifference to you whether
      one hundred or one thousand bottles of them pass down your throat? Also,
      you have tasted oysters and crabs. Thanks to your splendid living, nothing
      remains untasted for you in the years that are to come. And can you not
      separate yourself from these things? What is it you may still have to
      regret? Friends? Home? Do you really value them so highly that you would
      sacrifice yourself for them to the extent of postponing your supper-hour?
      Oh, had it been in your power, you would have extinguished the sun itself,
      for you have accomplished nothing worthy of the light. Confess it: you are
      hesitating to die, not because you will be sorry to leave the Curia, the
      Forum, or the beauties of nature. You are merely sorry to leave the
      flesh-market, and yet you have already tasted all its supplies.&quot; (<i>Seneca:
      Letter to Lucilius, </i>here quoted from N. Vassilyev: <i>The Question of
      the Decay of the Western Roman Empire, Transactions of the University of
      Kazan</i>, vol. 31, in Russian). This is a philosophy of absolute
      individualism, of persons recognizing no social ties; a pessimism, an
      advocacy of death, a fruitless criticism of all social institutions, a
      worship of abstract reason which despises all things; such is the
      philosophy of the time. Is it not a faithful reflection of the psychology
      of an over-sated, decaying, parasitic class, which has lost all taste for
      life? This psychology is an outcome of the social-economic conditions
      prevailing at the time.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">In the Middle Ages, the dominant system in Europe was
      that of feudalism, with a huge hierarchy of subjection; the Church also
      was constructed along these lines. Standards of law, manners, religion,
      all these forms of the superstructure were expressive of this system and
      served to consolidate it. It is obvious how significant a role must here
      be played by religion. For the foundation of religion is a relation of
      domination and subjection; consequently, particularly on the firm
      foundations of feudalism, a system of religious, spiritual serfdom
      necessarily and inevitably flourished. Therefore, philosophy also is
      distinctly religious in tone; it served as the maidservant of divinity (<i>ancilla
      theologiae</i>).</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">The typical orthodox philosopher of the Middle Ages,
      Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274; his principal work is the <i>Summa Theologiae,
      </i>&quot;Theological Encyclopedia&quot;) clearly reflects the feudal
      conditions in his philosophy. The world is divided into two portions: the
      everyday visible world and the &quot;forms inhabiting it&quot;. The
      highest and &quot;purest&quot; form is God. In addition to God, there are
      certain particular, specific &quot;forms&quot; (<i>formae separatae</i>),
      arranged according to certain degrees of dignity or rank: angels, the
      souls of men, etc. This entire philosophical system is based on the idea
      of constancy, of tradition, of authority. &quot;Step by step, as the
      bourgeoisie developed, there also developed an immense advance of science;
      astronomy, mechanics, physics, anatomy, physiology, again received
      attention. The bourgeoisie needed, in order to develop its industrial
      production, a science that would investigate the properties of natural
      bodies and the mode of operation of natural forces. Hitherto, however,
      science had been only the humble handmaiden of the church. . . Now science
      rebelled against the church; the bourgeoisie needed science and joined in
      the rebellion&quot; (Friedrich Engels: <i>Über historischen
      Materialismus, Die Neue Zeit</i>, 1893, vol. ii, part i, p.42). These
      needs for further growth were even reflected in cases where an agrarian
      aristocracy was at the helm. Thus, in England, the first harbinger of the
      great upheaval in the entire conception of the universe, and consequently
      in philosophy also, was Lord Francis Bacon (1561-1626). Bacon held that
      nature should be studied in order to be controlled. For this, we need
      above all &quot;the. art of invention&quot; (<i>ars inveniendi</i>); the
      old scholastic nonsense, and even Aristotle, must be thrown into the
      scrap-heap. Now, &quot;the old is done for; reason is victorious&quot; (<i>vetustas
      cessit, ratio vicit</i>). Marx considered Bacon as the founder of English
      materialism. &quot;For him, natural science was true science and the
      physics of the senses was the most distinguished part of natural science .
      . . . In his teaching, the sciences cannot deceive us; they are the source
      of all knowledge. Science means experimental science; it consists of the
      application of a rational method to that which is perceived by the senses.
      Induction, analysis, comparison, observation, experiment, are the
      principal conditions for a rational method. Among the properties inherent
      in matter, motion is the first and foremost&quot; But Marx also discovers
      many &quot;theological inconsistencies&quot; in Bacon. (Karl Marx and
      Friedrich Engels: <i>Die heilige Familie</i>, 1845, pp.201 <i>et seq.,
      </i>also quoted by Engels in <i>Über historischen Materialismus,
      </i>cited above.) In view of the period and the point of view of Bacon's
      class, we could not expect any other condition.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">French materialism in the Eighteenth Century declared
      war most emphatically on the feudal conception of the universe, in the
      field of philosophy, just as the bourgeoisie was declaring war on feudal
      society in the field of politics and economy. This materialism supported
      and energetically expounded the doctrine of the English philosopher Locke,
      according to which man has no &quot;innate ideas&quot;, all the psychical
      elements in man being merely a &quot;modification&quot; of feeling; this
      phase of the doctrine is termed <i>sensualism. </i>Feeling is declared a
      property of matter. Simultaneously, Locke believed in the omnipotence of
      human reason and of &quot;rationalism&quot;, the whole being permeated
      with an individualism that is also found expressed in the field of &quot;practical
      philosophy&quot; (the &quot;rights&quot; of the individual, the &quot;freedom&quot;
      of the individual, etc.). This philosophy, extremely revolutionary in its
      time, is an outgrowth of the revolutionary position of the bourgeoisie of
      the period, which was destroying the feudal world, its traditions, its
      Church, its religion, and its theological and conservative philosophy. The
      revolutionary attitude of the bourgeoisie may easily be explained by the
      social economy of the Eighteenth Century and by the conditions of the
      productive forces, which had encountered, in the feudal system, a great
      obstacle in their development, and which, operating through the
      bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, the artisans, and the
      semi-proletarians, were obliged to break down these barriers.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">In order to make the dependence of philosophy on the
      course of social life even clearer, we shall consider as our final example
      the philosophy of the bourgeoisie in the period of its decay, after the
      imperialist world war of i9t4-1918. The great crisis of the war, the
      crisis in economy, the social crisis which is bringing about a collapse of
      capitalism before our eyes, shattering its entire cultural structure to
      its very foundations, is producing among the ruling classes a psychology
      of despair, of profound skepticism, of pessimism, a lack of confidence in
      one's own forces, in the power of the intellect in general; this results
      in a return to mysticism, a seeking for the mysterious, an inclination
      toward occult rites and ancient religions, by the side of a reawakening of
      the modern form of parlor magic, spiritualism. In many of its traits, this
      philosophy recalls that of the ruling classes in the declining period of
      the Roman Empire. We shall close with a few specimens of this philosophy,
      characteristic of the collapse of capitalism.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">Paul Ernst (<i>Der Zusammenbruch des deutschen
      Idealismus, </i>Leipzig, 1918) is our first example. Ernst offers a
      criticism of the capitalist organization which led to war; this blind
      organization oppressed the individuality of man. &quot;Whence can a change
      come? There is but one way: humanity must bethink itself of itself; it
      must become aware of the fact that the most distinguished task imposed
      upon it by God (!) is that of setting goals for itself and its actions&quot;
      (p.400). Ideal wisdom, says Ernst, is found in China! &quot;We must attain
      clarity on the point that the foundations for the sufferings of men do not
      lie in institutions, but in the attitudes creating institutions &quot; Why
      has capitalism never succeeded in gaining a foothold in China? For the
      simple reason that the Chinese loves and honors agricultural work, and
      always succeeds in obtaining the little parcel of land (!) that he needs,
      and can produce on it what is required for his simple tastes &quot;. We
      want nor reforms or revolutions, but an introspective return to true
      morality&quot; (pp.406, 407). The ultimate source of all the goals are men
      of a higher order. &quot;The highest of our metaphysical thought we owe to
      men who lived naked in the for forests in India and nourished themselves
      on grains of rice, begged by their disciples&quot; (p.418). Therefore, we
      are to infer, according to Ernst, that the highest forms and methods of
      knowledge are those devised by men who have sucked the divine wisdom from
      their own thumbs; the highest forms of life are those of the Chinese
      peasant and his virtuous spouse. The solution offered by present-day
      philosophical thinking is: a flight from civilization, which has run into
      a blind alley.</font></p>

      Philosophen: </i>&quot;All truth (is) in the last analysis symbolical; the
      sun more correctly expresses the character of the divine . . .than does
      the best formulation of a conception. Therefore, all the worshipers of God
      are right in the eyes of God&quot; (the author is not joking; he is
      serious! N. B.). &quot;The divine reveals itself to man everywhere in the
      frame of his intimate prejudices.&quot; According to Keyserling, the Hindu
      fakirs are the ideal in faith and knowledge; for there is no cruder
      superstition than the belief in the insurmountable character of natural
      determinism. . . Man is spirit in his profoundest essence, and the more he
      recognizes this, the more firmly he believes it, the more of his fetters
      will fall away from him. It is therefore possible that, as in the Hindu
      myth, perfect knowledge may even overcome death (pp.282, 283). &quot;And
      he who is perfectly instructed, he who is of spiritual practices, utilizes
      faith according to his desire as an instrument. So far had gone the
      greatest among the Indians. . .They knew that all religious formations
      were of human origin. But they sacrificed now to this god, now to that,
      devout in their hearts, knowing well that this practice is useful to the
      soul&quot; (p.284), etc., etc.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">Oswald Spengler says in <i>Der Untergang des
      Abendlandes </i>(München, 1920): &quot;Systematic philosophy is today
      infinitely remote from us; ethical philosophy has reached its termination.
      There is still a third possibility, corresponding to Hellenic skepticism,
      within the Western mentality&quot; (p.63). This is a skeptical <i>history
      </i>of philosophy. Spengler considers the entire history of humanity and
      puts the idea of fate in the place of the idea of causality. It devolves
      upon each society, according to Spengler, to accomplish a cycle, running
      from youth to age and terminating in death; the European cultural cycle
      has exhausted its creative powers and is on the downward path. Our task is
      to predict this downward motion and adapt ourselves to the inevitable.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">The bourgeois philosophers, like the over-satisfied
      Roman higher bureaucrats, and the effeminate noble &quot;sages&quot; make
      journeys to foreign countries, in quest of men going about naked, in order
      to learn the great secret. Spengler predicts the fate of the Roman Empire
      for Europe, but he is reckoning without his host; while his glances have
      been turned to India and China, he has been blind to the proletariat at
      home. While in &quot;ancient times&quot; the lower classes were only
      capably of bringing about the &quot;philosophy&quot; of Christianity, we
      now have Marxian communism which cannot but gain strength in the ruins of
      the &quot;Abendland&quot; (occident). This communism has its <i>own</i>
      philosophy, a philosophy of action and battle, of scientific knowledge and
      revolutionary practice.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">We thus are again led to conclude that philosophy also
      is not a thing that is independent of social life, but that it is a
      quantity that changes in accordance with the changes in the various phases
      of society, i.e., in the last analysis, with the changes in economy and
      technology.</font></p>
    
    <p>We shall now take up another order of social phenomena - art. Art is as
      much a product of the social life as is science or any other outgrowth of
      material production; the expression &quot;objects of art&quot; will make
      this apparent. But art is an outgrowth of the social life in the further
      sense that it is a form of mental activity. Like science, it can develop
      only at a certain level of productive labor, in default of which it will
      wither and perish. But the subject of art is sufficiently complicated to
      justify an investigation of the manner in which it is determined by the
      course of social life; the first question requiring an answer is: what is
      art; what is its fundamental social function?</p>
    
    <p>Science classifies, arranges, clarifies, eliminates the contradictions
      in the thoughts of men; it constructs a complete raiment of scientific
      ideas and theories out of fragmentary knowledge. But social man not only
      thinks, he also feels; he suffers, enjoys, regrets, rejoices, . mourns,
      despairs, etc.; his thoughts may be of infinite complexity and delicacy;
      his psychic experiences may be tuned according to this note or that. Art
      systematizes these feelings and expresses them in artistic form, in words,
      or in tones, in gestures (for example, the dance), or by other means,
      which sometimes are quite material, as in architecture. We may formulate
      this condition in other words: we may say, for example, that art is a
      means of &quot;socializing the feelings&quot;; or, as Leo Tolstoi
      correctly says in his book, art is a means of emotionally &quot;infecting&quot;
      men. The hearers of a musical work expressive of a certain mood will be &quot;infected&quot;,
      permeated, with this mood; the feeling of the individual composer becomes
      the feeling of many persons, has been transferred to them, has &quot;influenced&quot;
      them; a psychic state has here been &quot;socialized&quot;. The same holds
      good in any other art; painting, architecture, poetry, sculpture, etc.</p>
    
    <p>The nature of art is now clear: it is a systematization of feelings in
      forms; the direct function of art in socializing, transferring,
      disseminating these feelings, in society, is now also clear.</p>
    
    <p>What conditions the development of art? What are the farms of its
      dependence on the course of social evolution? In order to answer these
      questions, we must analyze an art - we have selected <i>Music</i> for
      this purpose - into its component parts. Our investigation will show
      the following elements: 1. the element of <i>objective material things</i>,
      the musical technology: musical instruments and groups of musical
      instruments (orchestra, quartette, etc.; the combinations of instruments
      may be likened to combinations of machines and tools in factories); also,
      physical symbols and tokens: systems of notation, musical scores, <i>etc</i>.;
      2. the<i> human </i>organization; these include many forms of human
      association in musical work (distribution of persons in the orchestra, the
      chorus, in the process of musical creation; also, musical clubs and
      societies of all kinds); 3. the <i>formal </i>elements of music,
      including rhythm, harmony (corresponding to <i>symmetry </i>in the
      graphic and plastic arts), etc.; 4. the <i>methods </i>of uniting the
      various forms, principles of construction, what corresponds to style in
      some arts; in a broader sense, the type of artistic <i>form</i>; 5. the
      <i>content </i>of the art work, or, if we are dealing with an entire
      movement or tendency, the content of all the works; we are chiefly
      concerned here not with the <i>method </i>of performance, but with its
      substance, let us say with the choice of &quot;subject&quot; of
      presentation; 6. as a &quot;superstructure of the superstructure&quot;, we
      may also include, in music, <i>the theory of musical technique </i>(theory
      of counterpoint, etc.).</p>
    
    <p>Let us now consider the various causal relations between the evolution
      of music and social evolution in general, which is ultimately based on the
      economic and technical evolution of society.</p>
    
    <p><i>First. </i>We shall not again emphasize the fact that art may not
      flourish before a certain level has been attained in the productive forces
      of society.</p>
    
    <p><i>Second. </i>Only in a certain social &quot;atmosphere&quot; may art
      (and specifically, music) be singled out for development from among the
      innumerable forms of the superstructure. For example, in discussing the
      question of technology and art among the Greeks in the Fifth and Fourth
      Centuries B.C., we found that there was no growth of technical or natural
      sciences at all, but that philosophical speculation was widespread. There
      is no doubt that the &quot;superstructure&quot; in general rises at a fast
      pace if social technology is moving at a fast pace; but there is also no
      doubt that the superstructure does not move forward (or backward) <i>uniformly</i>;
      nor does <i>material </i>production advance uniformly; for instance, the
      manufacture of sausages may not keep abreast of the evolution of the
      productive forces to the same extent as the construction of locomotives or
      the production of castor oil. Certain forms of production usually develop
      much faster than others; in fact some such forms may be entirely absent,
      for certain reasons. The &quot;superstructure&quot; shows the same
      conditions: in Athens, in the Fifth Century B.C., technology fared badly,
      while speculative philosophy flourished. In America, in the Twentieth
      Century, technology is supreme and philosophy is neglected. Church hymns
      (a branch of the general field of music) were once universal, but it would
      be difficult to find many persons today - except a few :moldy old men and
      pious old women - who are fond of the conventional hymns. The mental &quot;shoots&quot;
      of society are the highest outgrowth of the superstructure, and we
      naturally expect that shoot to burgeon that happens to receive the most
      generous supply of sap. In ancient Athens it was an &quot;ignoble&quot;
      thing, worthy only of stupid artisans, to concern oneself with an
      investigation of nature by means of experiment; the disfavor in which the
      natural sciences were held is easy to understand; it was a result of the
      class alignment, of the social economy, which in its turn was conditioned
      by the social technology. Similarly, in the case of music, hymns might be
      quite important at an epoch when music still the &quot;handmaiden&quot; -
      as was also philosophy - of religion. But such hymns are as appropriate to
      a highly developed capitalist society as General Ludendorff's trousers to
      Father Sergius. The function of music in society is therefore dependent on
      the state of the latter, on society's mood, means, views, feelings, etc.
      The explanation of the latter is found in the class alignment and the
      class psychology, which are ultimately based on the social economy and the
      conditions of its growth.</p>
    
    <p><i>Third. </i>The &quot;technique&quot; of music depends in the first
      place on the technique of production. Savages cannot build pianos; this
      prevents them from playing the instrument or composing pieces for it. It
      is sufficient to compare the primitive musical instruments (aside from the
      natural instrument, the human voice), those developed from horn and pipe,
      from the needs o£ the chase,<sup class="anote"><a href="#20" name="20b">20)</a></sup>
      with the complicated construction of the modern piano, to grasp fully the
      function of these instruments. &quot;Music is not possible as an
      independent art until appropriate tools have taken shape and developed:
      the instruments and their development.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#21" name="21b">21)</a></sup>
      &quot;Music can express the gamut of emotions only within the scale of the
      available instruments.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#22" name="22b">22)</a></sup>
      The production of such things as the telescope and the piano are a portion
      of the social material production; it is obvious that musical &quot;technique&quot;
      (now meaning the instruments) depends on the technique of this material
      production.</p>
    
    <p><i>Fourth. </i>The organization of persons is also directly connected
      with the bases of the social evolution. For instance, the distribution of
      the members of an orchestra is determined precisely as in the factory, by
      the instruments and groups of instruments; in, other words, the
      arrangement and organization of these members is here conditioned by
      musical technique (in our restricted sense of the word) and, through it,
      based on the stage in social evolution, on the technique of material
      production as such. Similarly, the organization of persons in another
      musical field, let us say, a musical society, is the result of a number of
      conditions of social life, principally, a love of music (resulting from
      the social psychology, as above discussed), the opportunities afforded the
      various classes to indulge this predilection (for instance, the amount of
      unoccupied time available to the various classes, <i>i.e., </i>the class
      alignment and the degree of productivity of social labor), which elements
      govern the number of members, the extent and nature of their activity, the
      character of the membership, etc. Or, in the case of the creative process,
      we also find a number of forms for the human relations involved, the
      oldest of which is the impersonal stage (individual names are not handed
      down), the so called &quot;folk songs&quot;. Here the art work is produced
      in an elemental manner by thousands of nameless artists. Quite different
      is the case when the individual artist works &quot;on order&quot;, by the
      command of a prince, king or wealthy man. The case is again different when
      the artist works as an artisan for an unknown market, on whose caprices he
      depends. An artistic production may also result when the latter assumes
      the form of a social service, etc. These forms of human relations are
      obviously based directly on the economic structure. In the slaveholding
      system, the musicians were slaves; not so long ago, we still had serf
      musicians in Russia, performing and composing not to satisfy a market
      requirement, but at the command of a feudal magnate. Of course, these
      elements are expressed in the art work.</p>
    
    <p><i>Fifth. </i>The <i>formal elements </i>(rhythm, harmony, etc.) are
      also connected with the social life. Many of these elements are already
      present in prehistoric times, even in the animal kingdom. Karl Bucher says
      <sup class="anote"><a href="#23" name="23b">23)</a></sup> concerning
      rhythm among horses: &quot;Rhythm springs from the organic nature of man.
      Every normal use of his animal body he seems to control, as a regulating
      element of economic utilization of energy. The trotting horse and the
      laden camel move as rhythmically as the rowing fisherman and the hammering
      blacksmith. Rhythm awakens a feeling of well-being; it therefore not only
      renders work easier, but is a source of esthetic pleasure and the element
      of art to which all persons respond, regardless of their mental nature.&quot;
      Quite true; but rhythm has also developed - as Bucher points out in his
      work - under the influence of social relations and particularly under the
      direct influence of material labor (the &quot;workers' songs&quot;, like
      the Russian <i>Dubinushka</i>, arose on the same basis; rhythm here is an
      instrument of labor organization). In other words, while the formal (such
      as rhythm) may have arisen in prehistoric times, became man, they do not
      evolve from within them but under the influence of social evolution.</p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">A further circumstance is worth mentioning. At a
      certain stage of development, only the simplest rhythms are available to
      man (&quot;as monotonous as the singing of cannibals&quot;); he has <i>no
      ear </i>for the complicated rhythm perceived by a man at a <i>different
      </i>stage of development. A. V. Lunacharsky, in one of his essays on art,
      says: &quot;From all of the above (<i>i.e., </i>the determining role of
      economy, <i>N. B</i>.) it by no means follows that . . . the forms of
      creative work may not have their own immanent psycho-physiological laws;
      they have such laws and are <i>entirely </i>conditioned by them (my
      italics, <i>N. B</i>.) in their specific<i> form, </i>while the
      content is given by the social environment.&quot; We learn later on what
      is meant by this: &quot;The immanent psychological law of evolution in art
      is the law of complication. Impressions of similar energy and intricacy
      begin, after a number of repetitions, to exert less and less force on the
      mind, and to be capable of suggesting a lower intricacy. We experience a
      sense of monotony, of boredom (`it gets on my nerves'); it follows that
      every school of art will naturally seek to make more complicated and to
      enhance the effect of its works&quot; (A. V. Lunacharsky: <i>Further
      Remarks on the Theatre and Socialism</i>, in the collection <i>Verslziny</i>,
      p.196<i> et seq., </i>in Russian). We thus find the &quot;psycho-physiology&quot;
      contrasted with the &quot;economy&quot;; the &quot;content&quot; is left
      to economy, the &quot;form&quot; to psycho-physiology. This point of view
      seems to us to be at least insufficient, if not wrong. As a matter of
      fact, if we consider the evolution of those elements that we regard as
      formal, we shall find that this evolution has by no means proceeded at a
      uniform rate. The music of the savage, the number of harmonious tones
      produced by him, was very poor; yet, the social evolution itself was not
      characterized by great speed; manifestly the musical supply lasted for a 
      long time, did not produce &quot;boredom&quot; for a long time. &quot;Antiquity
      did not know our modern harmony and made use of unison arrangements; it
      took a long time for it to become accustomed to the octave. . . We have
      reason to believe that it is only recently that the fourth has been
      recognized as a harmonic interval&quot; (L. Obolensky: <i>The Scientific
      Bases of the Beautiful and of Art</i>, p.97, in Russian). Therefore, the
      formal elements become more complicated as a consequence of the <i>more
      complicated structure of life </i>for <i>an increasing intricacy of life
      alters the psycho-physiological &quot;nature&quot; of man. </i>The &quot;crude&quot;
      hearing of the savage is as much a function of social evolution as is the
      &quot;fine&quot; hearing of the inhabitants of the great capitalist cities
      with their extremely delicate nervous organization. The &quot;immanent
      laws&quot; therefore, are merely another phase of the social evolution.
      And since the social evolution is conditioned by the evolution of the
      productive forces, they constitute &quot;in the last analysis&quot; a
      function of these productive forces. For, man alters his nature <i>in
      accordance with his influence on the external universe</i>.</font></p>
    
    <p><i>Sixth. </i>The type, the <i>style</i>, is also conditioned by the
      course of social life. It embodies the current psychology and ideology; it
      expresses those feelings and thoughts, those moods and beliefs, those
      impressions, those current forms of thought, that &quot;are in the air&quot;.
      Style is not only external form, but also &quot;embodied content with its
      corresponding objective symbols&quot;; the history of the styles is an
      expression of the &quot;history of the systems of life&quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#24" name="24b">24)</a></sup>
      &quot;The style of form is a reflex of the social vitality.&quot;
      <sup class="anote"><a href="#25" name="25b">25)</a></sup> The religious
      music of the ancient Hindoo hymns (the <i>Vedas</i>) have not the same &quot;style&quot;
      or construction as - let us say - a French music-hall song or the
      battle-song of the revolution, the Marseillaise. These productions are the
      outgrowth of different environments, different social soils, and their
      form is consequently different; the religious hymn, the battle-song, the
      vaudeville song, cannot be composed or constructed in the same way; even
      their form expresses different feelings, thoughts, and views. This
      difference is a result of the difference in the situation of the societies
      or classes involved, and this difference is conditioned by the economic
      development and consequently, by the state of the productive forces.
      Furthermore, the style depends also in high degree on the material
      conditions of the specific work of art (for instance, instrumental music
      is conditioned by the nature of the instrument) as well as by the method
      of artistic creation (we have already discussed the organization of
      persons in music), etc. All these phases likewise depend on the
      fundamental causal relation in social evolution.</p>
    
    <p><i>Seventh. </i>The content (&quot;subject&quot;), almost impossible to
      isolate from the form, is obviously determined by the social environment,
      as may be readily seen from the history of the arts. It is obvious that
      artistic form will be given to what is engaging the attention of men in
      one way or another at the given moment. The creative spirit is not
      stimulated by subjects that do not hold its attention, but those things
      that constitute the central interest of society or of its various classes
      are given treatment, thus reflecting this general interest in the form of
      &quot;mental labor&quot;. &quot;There is indeed a certain moral
      temperature governing the general condition of manners and minds (<i>des
      esprits</i>).&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#26" name="26b">26)</a></sup>
      &quot;The artistic family (Taine here means a specific `school' or
      tendency in art. <i>N.B.</i>) is situated within a larger community;
      namely, the surrounding world, whose taste conforms with that of the <i>school.
      </i>For the state of morals and of mental life is the same for the public
      as for the artists; the latter are not isolated men.&quot;
      <sup class="anote"><a href="#27" name="27b">27)</a></sup> These
      statements by Taine are entirely correct, but Taine seems incapable of
      thinking them out to their ultimate conclusions, which would lead him into
      the acceptance of impious materialistic inferences. We have again and
      again discussed, in another shape, this question of the &quot;moral of the
      <i>&quot;milieu&quot;, </i>of which Taine speaks; both &quot;mental life&quot;
      in general, feelings and moods, do not develop out of themselves; we know
      that this social consciousness is the social being, <i>i.e., </i>the
      conditions of existence of society and its various parts (classes,
      groups). These conditions also give birth to the various &quot;tastes&quot;.
      As a result, the content of art is also determined, in the last analysis,
      by the fundamental natural law character of social evolution; its content
      is a function of the social economy, and therefore of the productive
      forces.</p>
    
    <p><i>Eighth. </i>Musical theory is obviously directly connected with all
      the foregoing, and therefore &quot;subject&quot; to the movement of the
      productive forces of society.</p>
    
    <p>We have outlined the fundamental chains of causality that exist in
      music; they do not at all exhaust the subject; in the first place,
      probably not all of these relations have been enumerated above, and, in
      the second place, there is in addition a mutual interaction of all these
      elements, resulting in a much more complicated and confused pattern, the
      general outlines of which, however, follow the scheme above indicated. Nor
      does it follow that the other arts will show precisely the same pattern as
      we have traced in the case of music. Each art has certain special
      earmarks: for instance, the material objects involved in singing are
      reduced to a minimum (there are notes, but the &quot;musical instrument&quot;
      remains the human voice alone); in architecture the role of the material,
      the tools, the purpose of the buildings (temple, residence, palace,
      museum, etc.), is of immense importance; the student must not neglect such
      distinctions, but we shall always find that the following holds, good:
      <i>directly or indirectly, art is ultimately determined in various' ways
      by the economic structure and the stage of the social technology.</i></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">At the early stages in its evolution, when human
      society had barely begun to turn out surplus products, art was in direct
      contact with; practical material life. The earliest forms of art are the
      dance and; music, and so much of poetry as was involved in the
      combination..; The original aim of these arts was to produce a mood of
      unity, as a preparation for a certain act (a sort of practice or
      repetition of the: act itself). Among certain &quot;savage&quot; tribes,
      the &quot;council-dances&quot;, the &quot;terrifying war-dances&quot;,
      etc., accompanied by the clapping of hands,` later also by primitive
      musical instruments, are examples of such dances. Rhythm developed
      together with work, as a principle <i>of </i>organization, as is
      excellently shown by Karl Bücher. The &quot;challenging&quot; dance
      of the New Zealanders may be taken as an example; it is accompanied by
      terrible grimaces and the utterance of threats (in order to frighten the
      opponent); also, the dances and songs representing the chase, fishing,
      etc. A particularly important part is played by the so called <i>work-song,
      </i>constructed on the rhythm of the work performed, the text being
      developed from the sound involuntarily ejaculated in the course of this
      work. The songs of the shepherds, or of the Bedouins as they direct the
      steps of the camels on their travels through the desert, etc. - these are
      <i>directly </i>connected with the daily labor of the environment. As
      society grows, and new ideologies arise, as &quot;civilization&quot;,
      etc., increases, art of course absorbs all these elements and ceases to be
      <i>directly </i>connected with the material life of production. For
      instance, as religion develops, music, the dance, etc., become a part of
      the cult. In Egypt, the ruling classes made a sort of mystery of music;
      the priests were scholars and musicians; religious music concerned them
      chiefly; the enslaved masses had their own music &quot;at home, in the
      fields&quot; (Kothe, <i>ibid</i>., p.11). We find the same
      condition among the East Indians, whose musicians formed a privileged
      caste (special families of musicians and singers): among the
      Assyro-Babylonians, whose conditions required them to wage war more
      frequently than other nations. Their music is principally military and
      military-religious in character (as suggested by, the instruments:
      cymbals, kettle-drums, etc.). The earliest musical works of the Greeks, of
      which we know, were the work-songs of shepherds, and war songs (&quot;songs
      of victory&quot;); only later, songs of social and family type (laments on
      the dead, wedding-songs, etc.): Among the Romans, there were chiefly
      shepherd and peasant songs (their instrument was the reed, <i>fistula</i>)
      and war-songs (the loud brass instruments were first introduced by the
      Romans. the trumpet, <i>tuba; </i>curved horn, <i>lituus; </i>a sort of
      trombone, <i>buccina, </i>etc.). Similarly, the other forms of art also
      have their roots in practice. Primitive painting, ornament, has its origin
      in poetry; for example: the; ornaments in many cases still suggest the
      earlier combination of pot and woven basket. Furthermore, the beginnings
      of painting simultaneously serve as the beginnings of writing. The first
      step in the development of script were drawings set down to aid the
      memory. The Bushmen, as well as the East Indians, attempt to record 
      certain visible objects on stone. The hieroglyphic inscriptions of the
      Egyptians, the Mexican symbols, are above all depictions of objects.
      Tattooing is closely connected with this practice. &quot;The practice of
      tattooing of words and syllables developed from more primitive forms. The
      earliest stage was that of pictorial representations on the human body
      (tattooings), with the purpose not only of securing religious effects
      (warding off spirits, etc.), but also of making known the tribe, the
      rank, age, etc., of those marked in this manner&quot; (R. Eisler: <i>AIlgemeine
      Kulturgeschichte, </i>3d ed., Leipzig, 1905, p.42). Markings for the
      purpose of producing terror, and adornments, must also be considered here.
      Since such adornments had the purpose of causing admiration and producing
      an impression, they were used chiefly in warfare (cf. Lippert: <i>Allgermeine
      Kulturgeschichte); </i>they include, for instance, the &quot;war-masks&quot;
      of Germanic tribes, which were used in war, according to Tacitus (here is
      the germ of sculpture). Architecture is chiefly &quot;technical&quot; in
      character, as will be readily understood; originally it amounted merely to
      the construction of (materially) useful edifices. &quot;The Greek temple
      and Gothic spire are both merely the permanent representations of useful
      wooden constructions&quot; (John Ruskin: <i>Lectures on Art, </i>New
      York: Maynard, Merrill &amp; Co., 1893, p.42). &quot;The lovely forms of
      these were first developed in civil and domestic building, and only after
      their invention, employed ecclesiastically on the grandest scale&quot; (<i>ibid</i>.,
      p.141). Of course, the <i>direct </i>influence of production relations
      made itself particularly noticeable here; in Egypt, the firm construction
      of the houses with their receding walls, was due to the overflowing of the
      Nile, as such walls were capable of offering more resistance to the rush
      of waters. Columns were used as props before the arch and vault were
      known.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">In order to show the dependence of form, and therefore
      of style, on the social environment, we shall offer a few examples in this
      field, taking our material chiefly from the interesting investigations of
      Wilhelm Hausenstein. In the primitive reproductive arts, we may discern
      two periods: a purely naturalistic period (representing things as they
      were) on the one hand, and a conventionalized ornamentation and symbolic
      drawings, with little resemblance to reality, on the other. In the former
      case, we have drawings of bisons, horses, mammoths, reindeer, scenes of
      the chase, etc., found on the walls of caves, or drawn on the bones of
      horses, the teeth of mammoths, or reindeer antlers, etc. In the second
      period, we have chiefly conventionalized idols and human and animal
      figures. Max Verworn explains this circumstance as follows: &quot;The
      palaeolithic hunter of the earlier period did not yet possess, as far as
      we know, the notion of the soul. &quot; He looked for nothing behind
      things (<i>i.e., </i>was not yet an animist, <i>N.B</i>.). He had no
      metaphysics; he concerned himself only with what he perceived, fully
      resembling the Bushman in this respect.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;all
      tribes among whom the conception of the soul and other religious
      conceptions have gained a control over life, as among negroes, American
      Indians, South Sea Islanders, we find extremely ideoplastic (&quot; <i>i.e.,
      </i>symbolic not `naturalistic', or in Verworn's words, `physioplastie',
      <i>N. B.</i>) art.&quot; (Max Verworn: <i>Zur Psychologie der primitiven
      Kunst, Naturwissenschaftliche Wochenschrift, </i>New Series, vol. vi,
      Jena, 1907; also quoted by Hausenstein, <i>ibid</i>., p.38). Hausenstein
      observes that Verworn does not pursue the thought to its conclusion;
      Hausenstein finds the nucleus of the matter in the fact that the hunter is
      more an individualist, the peasant more of a collectivist. But the fact of
      the matter is that &quot;ideoplastic art&quot;, like religion, grows with
      the growth of particular conditions of production, namely, the relation of
      domination and subjection In the feudal era, this relation attains huge
      dimensions in production and ; the gulf between the slave and the despot
      may indicate the extent of this relation. This condition determines the
      specific style of all feudal eras, has brilliantly analyzed by
      Hausenstein. The power and domination of the divine despots, of mighty
      feudal kings, of Pharaohs, their unattainable sublimity, valor, audacity,
      etc., as opposed to common mortals - this is the essential point expressed
      in the feudal styles of the Egyptians, Assyro-Babylonians, of the earliest
      Greeks, Chinese, Japanese, Mexicans, Peruvians, East Indians, as well as
      in the Romanesque and early Gothic art of Western Europe (Hausenstein:
      <i>Versuch einer Soziologie der bildenden Kunst, </i>in <i>Archiv für
      Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik, </i>May, 1913, pp.778, 779).
      Literary examples from the epochs mentioned will support this statement.
      From the legal code of the Babylonian king Hammurabi, whom we have
      mentioned before, we take the words: &quot;I am Hammurabi, the
      incomparable king. With the mighty weapon given me by Zamama and Innanna,
      with the wisdom given me by Ea, with the reason bestowed upon me by
      Marduk, I have destroyed the enemies to the North (above) and to the South
      (below), have terminated dissension, have bestowed prosperity upon the
      laid . . . .The great gods called me . . . . I am the beneficent shepherd
      . . . . I am Hammurabi, the King of Truth, upon whom Shamash bestowed the
      quality of justice. My words are good, my deeds incomparable, sublime. .
      .They are a pattern for the wise, to attain fame&quot; (quoted from
      Turayev, <i>ibid</i>., pp.114, 115). The following eulogy of a king is
      found on an Egyptian tomb: &quot;Praise the king in your bodies, bear him
      in your hearts. He is the god of universal wisdom living in hearts . . . .
      He is the radiant sun illuminating both the earths more than the disk of
      the sun; he makes more things green than the great Nile; he fills both the
      earths with power, he is breath-giving life . . . .The king is sustenance.
      Multiplication is his lips, he is the begetter of what is, he is Hnum,
      original Father of man . . . .Battle for his name,&quot; etc. (<i>ibid</i>.,
      p.325). Meanwhile, &quot;in good society&quot;, the lower stations were
      despised. An Egyptian father, giving paternal advice to his son, wants the
      latter to become a court scribe, and speaks of the lower trades as
      follows: &quot;I have never seen a smith serve as an envoy, or a jeweler
      as an ambassador; but I have seen a smith working at his forge; his
      fingers were like the hide of a crocodile; he spread an odor worse than
      rotten fish-roe. . . The peasant wears an eternal garment (<i>i.e., </i>never
      changes it, N. B.). His health may be compared with that of a man lying
      under a lion . . . . The weaver in his workshop is weaker than woman; his
      feet lie against his stomach; he has nowhere to breathe. If he does not
      complete his daily task, he is beaten like lotus on a swamp,&quot; etc. (<i>ibid</i>.,
      p.231). The Egyptian king Yakhmos says of himself: &quot;The Asians
      approach full of fear and are judged by him; his sword enters into Nubia,
      the fear of him into the land Fenekha; the fear of his splendor is like
      that of the God Min,&quot; (<i>ibid</i>., p.272). Fritz. Burger thus
      characterizes the ancient Egyptian, <i>i.e., </i>feudal, art <i>(Weltanschaasungsprobleme
      und Lebenssysteme iii der Kunst der Vergangenheit</i>, pp.43, 44): &quot;Egyptian
      art is an embodiment of the notion of immortality, not as mere symbol,
      however, but as a reality (the `eternal' pyramids, of unusual permanence,
      statues, etc., <i>N. B</i>.). . . A powerful suggestion of force emanates
      from them; they make us bend the knee; they have the awe-inspiring quality
      of a higher existence incorporated within them they bear witness to the
      disciplined strength of life in its dreadful tension, to a super-personal
      eternal power, whose pride keeps us at a distance, to the soulless
      severity of a being that is indifferent to all mere matters of detail;
      they reflect the brilliancy of their master's light, as remote as the
      stars.&quot; Therefore: &quot;Every feudal civilisation carries on a
      worship of quantity&quot; (Hausenstein: <i>Die Kunst und</i> <i>die
      Gesellschaft, </i>p.46). The huge pyramids, the gigantic monuments of the
      Pharaohs or the Assyrian-Babylonian kings, are a form of greatness and
      might; art is monumental and frontal; the &quot;interior decoration&quot;
      of the present-day bourgeoisie would not have sufficed for feudal
      conditions; the bearing of the figures of rulers is prescribed exactly:
      upright stature, not human, but half divine, as opposed to the slaves and
      ordinary mortals (the ancient Greeks designated the bearing of a slave,
      etc., by the word <i>proskynesis, i.e., </i>&quot;dog-like creeping&quot;).
      One of the best specialists on Egypt, Ehrmann, maintains that the human
      body is represented in a number of different forms in Egyptian painting,
      according to the social rank: it is natural for ordinary mortals,
      conventionalized for superiors; virile power is represented by a wide
      chest, not foreshortened as perspective would require; among the
      Egyptians, the chest is always given its full width, even if the figure
      stands in profile. The same spirit also prevailed in archaic, feudal,
      early Greek art (the heroic &quot;energetic power of early Attic art&quot;,
      &quot;the severe energy of the Dorians&quot;, the so called &quot;Doric
      style&quot;; (<i>cf</i>. B. Haendcke: <i>Entwicklungsgeschichte der
      Stilarten, </i>Bielefeld-Leipzig, 1913, p.10). Approximately the same
      condition is found among the East Indians, Peruvians, Mexicans, Chinese
      and Japanese. &quot;When the Mexican Aztec succumbed to the Conquistadors
      under Hernando Cortez, the style of this kingdom was almost identical both
      socially and aesthetically with the style of the feudal despotism,&quot;
      (Hausenstein, <i>ibid</i>., p.77). In literature we find in addition to
      the eulogies of kings, in inscriptions and elsewhere, also heroic warlike
      epics, and the heroic-knightly drama; among the Greeks, the Iliad and the
      Odyssey; among the Japanese, the knightly drama, glorifying the fidelity
      of the Samurai, who were the feudal masters; among the Incas, likewise the
      heroic drama, etc. A divine sublimity, a crude strength, both inaccessible
      to ordinary mortals, are expressed also in medieval European art,
      particularly in the architecture of the cathedrals, built in the course of
      many years by great numbers of unknown persons; later, in the bourgeois
      epoch, these gloomy and solemn structures began to be designated as &quot;citadels
      of the spirit&quot;.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">The transition from the feudal style to the bourgeois
      styles begins everywhere with the growth of trade, of commercial capital,
      or trade. capitalist relations, in the Athens of the Fifth Century, in the
      Italian commercial city republics of the Renaissance, later in the
      commercial cities of all Europe. The process was finally completed with
      the definite collapse of feudalism, <i>i.e., </i>with the victory of the
      French revolution (1789-1793). In the place of the masses, held down by
      the feudal system, by the scale of hierarchic relations, we have the bour<i>geois
      individual </i>with his commercial calculations, his thoughts of profit, &quot;a
      man and a citizen&quot;. In music the situation is as follows to the
      Sixteenth Century, the <i>community </i>principle prevailed (i.e., in the
      sense of feudal restrictions, serfdom, but after all a form of
      organization, <i>N. B</i>.); the individual was relegated entirely to the
      background. He was absorbed in the family, the community, the Church, the
      guild or brotherhood, the state. Accordingly, choral music was the
      prevalent form of the times. But now the individual also wished to make
      himself felt (<i>i.e., </i>the energetic, vigorous bourgeois individual,
      then still &quot;young&quot; eager for knowledge, capable of practical
      calculations, <i>N. B</i>.),and therefore we find individual singing and
      . . . the musical drama growing up by the side of the chorus&quot; (Kothe,
      <i>ibid</i>., p.159<i>). </i>The new musical style (<i>stile
      rappresentativo, i.e., </i>the style of theatrical performances, of opera,
      of drama), practically constituted a transition to recitative, <i>i.e.,
      </i>half singing, half conversation; melody, rhythm, etc.; all were
      subordinated to a faithful representation of the words of the text. (&quot;It
      is extremely interesting to note the concomitants of the circumstance that
      this new musical style arose simultaneously in three quarters,&quot;
      writes Kothe, <i>ibid</i>., p.161, &quot;so that it is difficult to
      determine the real `inventor'.&quot; The reader should recall, in this
      connection, Bordeaux' remark concerning the similar condition in science,
      already mentioned in our discussion of that &quot;superstructure&quot;).
      The trained merchant replaced the royal-feudal religious banner with a
      desire for the earthly, for the individual human. Leonardo da Vinci, one
      of the greatest artists of all times and peoples, and one of the most
      significant of all humans, magnificently expressed the new tendency of
      thought in many fields: as a philosopher, inventor, natural scientist,
      mathematician, an incomparable artist, and even as a poet. &quot;Leonardo
      renounces all mysticism. He reduces the fact of human life to the law of
      circulation, well known and well drawn by him. With cold cynicism, he
      analyzes the structural laws of the world of human forms, and with an
      intellectual brutality that is above all sentimentality, he graphically
      depicts the sexual act. . . He approaches the problem of light by the path
      of knowledge; the influence of light and atmosphere on form becomes the
      problem of experimental optics. The rhythm of graphic composition is for
      him a geometrical secret; the wonderful panel with Saint Anna, the
      Madonna, the Jesus child, and the Lamb, is doubtless the outcome of very
      exhaustive mathematical combinations, of painful thought concerning the
      theory of curves&quot; (Hausenstein, <i>ibid</i>., pp.100-102). Realism,
      rationalism, individualism, these are the &quot;-isms&quot; of the
      Renaissance. In poetry, the path of transition from the Medieval-Gothic
      style to the new style is successively marked by Dante, Petrarch,
      Boccaccio, etc. The &quot;content&quot; of this art is a criticism of
      feudal churchdom, a rejection of the feudal style in favor of an elegant
      style of the world; realistic, but also personal, individual. The
      connection with the social life is here clearly evident.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">Unfortunately we cannot dwell on all the art forms, for
      instance, on the Baroque, on which, by the way, we have an excellent
      Marxian work by Hausenstein, <i>Vom Geist des Barock </i>(München,
      1920). We shall proceed at once to the modern period. Just before
      the French Revolution, the so called Rococo style prevailed, the social
      basis of which was the rule of the feudal aristocracy and the financial
      oligarchy (haute finance), parvenus who bought ducal and princely titles
      and adopted aristocratic manners. Positions of tax-farmers were sold,
      manipulations and dubious financial operations were carried on on the
      Stock exchange; commercial and colonial policy, domination by the
      nobility, which needed money and sold its titles, rich burghers
      who bought these titles (also purchasing the young scions of the nobility
      '`as husbands for their daughters), etc., such was the environment &quot;up
      above&quot;. This environment determined the manners peculiar to this
      gallant &quot;period&quot;. Life was dominated by love, not as a powerful
      passion, but in the form of philandering, which had become the trade of
      elegant idlers. The ideal type was that of the specialists in deflowering
      virgins (the <i>deverginateur</i>); the frivolous doctrine of the &quot;proper
      moment&quot; for this operation constituted practically the spiritual axis
      of the age. Rococo art, with its delicate and absolutely erotic curves, is
      a perfect reflection of these traits in the social psychology (<i>cf.
      </i>Hausenstein: <i>Rokoko; Französische und deutsche Illustratoren
      des XVIII Jahrhunderts, </i>München, 1928). With the growth of the
      bourgeoisie, with their battle and victory, a new style was brought forth,
      the best representative of which is, in French painting, David. This style
      was the embodiment of the bourgeois virtues of the revolutionary
      bourgeoisie: the ancient &quot;simplicity&quot; of its forms expressed its
      &quot;content&quot;, concerning which Diderot wrote that art must have the
      purpose of glorifying great and fine deeds, of honoring unhappy
      and defamed virtue, of branding flagrant vice and of inspiring tyrants
      with fear. Diderot also advised dramatists &quot;to get close to real life&quot;;
      he himself blazed the trail in literature for the so called &quot;bourgeois
      drama&quot; (<i>Cf. </i>Fr. Muekle: <i>Das Kulturproblem der französischen
      Revolution</i>, vol. i, Jena, 1921, pp.177<i> et. seq</i>.); which
      was called <i>le genre honnête </i>(Beaumarchais' <i>Le
      Mariage de Figaro </i>may be taken as a specimen). The social roots of
      this <i>genre honnête </i>are perfectly manifest. If, after having
      viewed a painting by Watteau, of the Rococo School, we return to our room
      and open J. J. Rousseau's <i>Nouvelle Héloise, </i>we shall find
      we have entered a different sphere (George Brandes: <i>Main Currents of
      the Nineteenth Century Literature, </i>New York, vol. i, p.17). This
      changed <i>artistic </i>sphere corresponds closely with the changed <i>social</i>
      sphere; the burgher has become the hero in the place of the enervated
      parlor butterflies of the aristocracy, and he begins to create his <i>genre
      honnête.</i></font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">For purposes of contrast, it would be very interesting
      to consider the art of the dying bourgeoisie. This art has been expressed
      with `particular sharpness in Germany, where, by reason of the military
      collapse and the Peace of Versailles, on the one hand, and the constant
      menace of a proletarian uprising on the other hand, the general basic note
      in the life of the bourgeoisie has become particularly gloomy; where the
      capitalist mechanism is deteriorating most rapidly, and where, therefore,
      the process of &quot;unclassing&quot;, of transforming bourgeois
      intellectuals into human &quot;riff-raff&quot;, is rapidly proceeding,
      into individuals thrown from their course by the pressure of great events.
      This condition of hopelessness is expressed in a strengthening of
      individualism and mysticism. There is a convulsive grasping for a &quot;new
      style&quot;, for new forms of generalization, without any possibility of
      finding them; each day brings some new &quot;-ism&quot;, which does not
      hold the ground for long. Impressionism is followed by Neo-Impressionism,
      then by Expressionism, etc. A vast number of tendencies and experiments,
      an accumulation of paper theories, but no reasonably solid synthesis. This
      may be observed in painting as well as in music, poetry, sculpture, in
      short, all along the line. Bourgeois reactionaries, timidly recording the
      gradual disintegration of their culture, of their:: class, formulate this
      process in some such way as this; a faith in the mysterious is developing;
      a belief in witchcraft and miracle-workers, in spiritualism and theosophy.
      &quot;The head of a group of so called occult devotees writes book after
      book and delivers lecture after lecture &quot; Diligent spiritualists,
      Christian Scientists, or theosophists, have a lot to say, but are neither
      moved by the alleged revelations,`nor moving by their communication&quot;
      (Max Dessoir: <i>Die neue Mystik und die neue Kunst, </i>in <i>Die Kunst
      der Gegenwart, </i>Leipzig, 1920, p. 130). &quot;Our latest artists also
      maintain that what they create is the expression of the <i>contents of
      visions </i>(my italics, <i>N. B.</i>), and that each art work consists
      of `ecstatic gestures' of the soul&quot; (p.132). We are asked to consider
      this as an expression of magic idealism; &quot;in poetry, sacrificing the
      sentence to the word, or even Dadaism (the derivation of this name from
      `da-da', the earliest sound produced by infants, is illustrative of the
      childish attitude characteristic of this tendency, N. B.) ; in painting
      and sculpture, a crude childish trifling &quot; Christian Scientists,
      astrologers and their ilk, distort the admitted fact that wisdom is not
      exhausted by the logic of syllogisms, into a laudation of prenatal negro
      metaphysics&quot; (<i>ibid</i>., pp.133, 134). Little closed groups,
      cliques, leagues, are promulgated, within which the. artists surrender
      themselves to a mysterious contemplation of the hereafter and the joys of
      this wondrous creation. Together with this tendency, we find an
      inclination toward &quot;emotional communism&quot;, an indication of the
      profound fall of the bourgeoisie as a class. Mysticism is therefore
      triumphant. Jules Romains (<i>Manuel de deification, </i>quoted by
      Dessoir, <i>ibid., </i>p.137), requires &quot;a state of mystical rapture
      as a condition for the conquest of the world by art&quot;, and Dessoir,
      having become sufficiently tired of this image, expresses the single hope
      that this unhealthy mysticism may in some way be healed by a return to the
      path of faith in the God of earlier days! (p.138). An expressionist
      theorist, Theodor Daubler (<i>Der neue Standpunkt, </i>Leipzig, 1919,
      p.180), excellently expresses this essentially and profoundly
      individualist point of view of the disintegrated social atoms: &quot;The:
      center of the world is in every ego, even in the ego-justified work.&quot;
      Of course, this point of view leads to mysticism. &quot;We hear everywhere
      pronounced the cry: `Away from nature!' It is obvious what this means, as
      far as expressionist poetry and graphic art are concerned: a departure
      from what is supplied us by the senses, a transcending of the limits of
      sensuous experience, a tendency to elevate oneself to that which lies
      behind phenomena&quot; (<i>ibid</i>., p.142). In music we are led to
      super-music, to anti-music, without harmony, with. out rhythm, without
      melody, etc. (Arnold Schering: <i>Die expressionistishe Bewegung in der
      Musik, </i>in the work already quoted, <i>Einführung in die Kunst
      der Gegenwart, </i>pp.142 <i>et seq</i>.). A general social evaluation of
      all this business from the point of view of capitalist culture is given by
      Max Martersteig (<i>Das iiingste Deutschland </i>in <i>Literatur and
      Kunst, ibid</i>., p.25): &quot;The states of rapture produced by the
      suffering of monstrous things must yield place to reason. No variety of
      war psychosis or disarmament psychosis may any longer, serve as an excuse
      for fragmentary and anarchic work.&quot; The author invokes a spirit of &quot;highest
      responsibility&quot;, but his invocations will be of no avail, for it is
      impossible to find a new sublime synthesis in the decaying temple of
      capitalism; debris and ruins, an incoherent mystical babbling and the &quot;ecstasies&quot;
      of theosophical sects, will now be inevitable. Such always has been the
      case in civilizations destined to early extinction.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">We shall also say a few words on fashions, which have
      already been touched upon. In certain respects, fashions are related to
      art (in &quot;<i>style</i>&quot;:<i> e.g.</i>, the garments and costumes
      of the Rococo period corresponded perfectly with the Rococo art). In other
      traits, fashion is connected with standards of conduct, with the rules of
      decency, customs, etc. Fashions therefore also develop in accordance with
      the social psychology, the succession of its forms, the rate of change,
      depending in turn on the character of this social development. Here, for
      instance, we find the roots of the inordinately swift changes of
      fashions at the end of the capitalist period. &quot;Our inner rhythmics
      (corresponding to the headlong course of life, <i>N. B</i>.) require
      shorter and shorter periods for each new impression&quot; (Georg Simmel:
      <i>Die Mode, </i>Leipzig, 1918, p.35). Wherein lies the social
      significance of ions? What is their role in the current of social life?
      Here is Simmel's brilliant answer: &quot;They are . . . a product of the
      division along class lines, the case being similar to that of a number of
      other social formations, particularly with honor, having the double
      function of holding a group together and at the same time keeping it
      separate in other groups . . . . Thus, fashions on the one hand express
      one's connection with those of equal rank, the unity of the circle defined
      by these fashions, and simultaneously the exclusiveness of this group as
      opposed to those further down in the scale&quot; (<i>ibid</i>., pp.28,
      29).</font></p>
    
    <p><i>Language </i>and <i>thought, </i>the most abstract ideological
      categories o<i>f </i>the superstructure, are also functions of social
      evolution It has sometimes been fashionable among Marxists or
      pseudo-Marxists to declare that the origin of these phenomena has no
      relation with historical materialism. Kautsky, for example, went so far as
      to claim that the powers of human thought are almost unchanging. Such is
      not the case, however; these ideological forms, so extraordinarily
      important in the life of society, constitute no exception to the other
      ideological forms of the superstructure in their own origin and evolution.</p>
    
    <p>A preliminary question must first be disposed of: namely, the doubt that
      at once appears in a discussion of language and thought. It is customary
      to admit that language is a social relation, a tool in the intercourse
      between men, an instrument of cohesion; and that Marx is right when he
      states that it would be absurd to speak of an evolution of language if men
      did not speak to each other. But the case with thought seems different,
      for each individual thinks, has his own brain, and only a mystic could
      attempt to seek the roots of this individual human thought in society.
      This objection is based on an incomplete understanding of the close
      relation between thought and language. Thought always operates with the
      aid of words, even when the latter are not spoken; thought is speech minus
      sound. The process of thinking is a process of combining concepts, which
      are always dealt with in the form of word symbols. A person who has made
      excellent progress in a foreign language may begin to think in that
      language. In fact, it is easy to find illustrations, in the reader's own
      experience, of the fact that the process of thought, of rumination, is
      accomplished with the aid of words. This being the case, and if we admit
      that speech is associated with society in its origin as well as in its
      growth, it results logically that the same must be true of thought. And
      the facts show that the evolution of thought has coincided with that of
      language. One of the most distinguished philologists, Ludwig Noire, says:
      &quot;The social activity directed <i>toward </i>a common goal, the most
      ancient <i>labor </i>of the elders of the clan, is the source from which
      language and reasoning originated.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#28" name="28b">28)</a></sup>
      Human speech is as much an outgrowth of the sounds ejaculated during labor
      as are music and song. Philology has shown that the original basis of the
      vocabulary is the so called action roots, the earliest words being such as
      designated chiefly an action (verbs). In the later growth of language,
      objects also received their designations (nouns), insofar as these objects
      were prominent in the labor experience of man; such names were given
      chiefly to the tools used, and were developed from the verbal terms for
      the actions involved. Parallel with this evolution proceeded the
      consolidation of more definite <i>concepts </i>out of the mass of
      material which - figuratively speaking - filled man's head, echoed in his
      ears, appeared before his eyes, etc. But the <i>concept is </i>the <i>beginning
      of thought.</i></p>
    
    <p>The further evolution of thought and language proceeds along the lines
      followed by the other forms of the ideological superstructure; namely,
      they follow the evolution of the productive forces. In the course of this
      evolution, the external world ceases to be a world <i>per se, </i>becomes
      man's world; ceases to be mere matter, becomes material for human action;
      instruments of material labor, coarse at first, later more and more
      delicate, as well as instruments of scientific knowledge, together with
      the countless &quot;feelers&quot;, such as machines, telescopes, acute
      reasoning, aid society in its annexation of more and more of this external
      world to society's sphere of labor and knowledge. A vast number of new
      concepts, and consequently of new words, is the result; language his
      enriched and is made to include the totality of subjects that constitute
      the concern of human thought and speech, <i>i.e., </i>of human
      communication.</p>
    
    <p>The &quot;fullness of life&quot; results in the &quot;richness&quot; of
      language. As some shepherd tribes (&quot;pure cattle breeders&quot;) have
      no subject of conversation but their cattle, owing to the fact that the
      low level of their productive forces restricts their entire life to the
      sphere of production, and their language therefore remains directly
      connected with the process of production. If, as a result of enhanced
      productive forces, a huge and complicated ideological superstructure has
      been erected, language will of course embrace this superstructure also,
      <i>i.e., </i>the connection of language with the process of production is
      more and more indirect; the dependence of language on the technique of
      production is now an indirect dependence; the causal chain now runs <i>through
      </i>the dependence of the various superstructural forms on the process of
      production, and even the latter dependence may no longer be a direct one.
      The increased :number of words borrowed from foreign languages is a good
      example of the manner in which language grows. Such borrowings result from
      an economy of universal dimensions and the development of a number of
      practically identical things in many countries, or of events having
      universal significance <i>(telephone, aeroplane, radio, Bolshevism,
      Comintern, Soviet, </i>etc.). It would lead us too far afield to point out
      in detail that the character, the <i>style</i> of a language also changes
      with the conditions of the social life; but it is worth while to mention
      that the division of society into classes, groups, and occupations also
      impresses its mark on a language; the city-dweller has not the same
      language as the villager; the &quot;literary language&quot; is different
      from &quot;common&quot; speech. This difference may become so great as to
      prevent men from understanding each other; in many countries there are
      popular &quot;dialects&quot; that can hardly be understood by the cultured
      and wealthy classes; this is a striking example of the class cleavage in
      language. And the various occupations have their special languages;
      learned philosophers, accustomed to dwell in a world of subtle
      distinctions, write - and sometimes even speak - a language that only
      their fellows can understand. The desire to indulge in such forms of
      expression is partly due to the same cause that produces fashions in
      dress; namely, to distinguish these persons from &quot;everyday mortals&quot;.
      Thus, a Russian noble landowner would show his &quot;class&quot; by
      bringing back with him from Paris, clothes of foreign design, an expensive
      mistress, and an accentuated pronunciation of the letter <i>r</i>. Wundt
      shows that the peculiar intonation of the Puritans also had this social
      character; they not only took the names of patriarchs and prophets, but
      even imitated in their speech the chanting tones in which the Bible is
      still read aloud in the Jewish synagogues. Wundt rightly observes that the
      philologist cannot afford to consider language as a phenomenon that is
      isolated from human society; on the contrary, our conjectures as to the
      evolution of linguistic forms must accord with our view of the origin and
      evolution of man in general, the growth of the forms of social life, the
      origin of customs and law.</p>
    
    <p>Thought has not always followed the same lines. Certain respectable
      scholars find that science originates in man's mysterious and universal
      inclination toward causal explanations, but they do not consider the
      question of the cause of this extremely laudable tendency. But we may now
      consider the mutability of the types of thought to have been definitely
      established. Thus, Lévy-Brühl devotes a whole book
      <sup class="anote"><a href="#29" name="29b">29)</a></sup> We are quoting
      chiefly from Professor A. Pogodin's Russian work, <i>Border-Regions
      between the Animal and Human, </i>in <i>New Ideas in Sociology, </i>Collection
      No.4to the mode of thought of savages, which he considers entirely
      different from the present &quot;logical&quot; thought, terming it
      pre-logical. In savage thought, details and specific things are often not
      distinguished from the general or even the whole; one thing is confused
      with another. The entire world is not a system of things, but a system of
      mobile <i>forces, </i>man being one of these; individual man is not a
      personality: personality is absolutely socialized, being absorbed in
      society and not distinct from the latter. The &quot;fundamental law&quot;
      of savage thought is not the concept of causal succession, but what Lévy-Brühl
      terms the law of &quot;participation&quot; (<i>loi de la participation</i>),
      if it is possible to exert an influence on any object under conditions
      which-from our point of view-preclude such a possibility. &quot;The law of
      participation permits him to shift from the individual to the group and
      from the group to the individual without the slightest difficulty. Between
      a bison and bisons in general, between a bear and bears in general,
      between a reindeer and reindeers in general, this psychology accepts a
      mystical participation.<sup class="anote"><a href="#30" name="30b">30)</a></sup></p>
    
    <p>This psychology has no place for the species as an aggregate, or for the
      individual existence of its members, in our sense of these words.&quot; Lévy-Brühl
      himself finds a connection between this type of thought and a certain type
      of social existence, in which personality had not yet been differentiated
      from society, i.e., he connects this stage of thought with primitive
      communism.</p>
    
    <p>Causality, as found among savages, is not <i>our</i> causality, but an
      animistic causality, the result of the inclination of the savage to seek a
      spiritual, divine, or daemonic principle operative in all situations. All
      things that come to pass have been &quot;ordained&quot; by someone: <i>cause
      </i>seems identical with a <i>command </i>emanating from a superior
      spirit. The law of causal succession becomes the whim of the Supreme
      Being, the spiritual ruler (or rulers) of the universe. Therefore, while
      the tendency to seek causes seems to be present in man, savage man seeks
      causes of a specific kind, causes emanating from a certain higher power.
      Of course, this type of thought is also related with a certain social
      order. It is typical <i>for a society that already shows the presence of
      a hierarchy in production and social polity.</i></p>
    
    <p>The further course of development presents the same process; it has
      already been touched upon in our discussion of philosophy. The above
      examples suffice to show that <i>thought and the forms of thought are a
      varying quantity, and that this variability is based on the variability in
      the evolution of society, its organization of labor, and its technical
      backbone.</i></p>
    
    <p>An excellent recapitulation of this subject is the magnificent
      formulation made by Karl Marx in his <i>A Contribution to a Critique of
      Political Economy:</i></p>
    
    <p>&quot;In the social production of their lives, men enter into specific,
      necessary relations, independent of their wills, production relations,
      which correspond to a certain specific stage in the evolution of their
      material productive forces. The totality of these production relations
      constitutes the economic structure of society, the real basis, over which
      there rises a legal and political superstructure, and to which there
      correspond specific social forms of consciousness. The mode of production
      of material life conditions the social, political, and mental life-process
      in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their
      being, but, on the contrary, their social being determines their
      consciousness&quot; (<i>Zur Kritik der politischen Okonomie, </i>Stuttgart
      1915, p.IV.).</p>
    
    <p>The huge &quot;superstructure&quot; that rises over the economic basis
      of society is of rather intricate internal &quot;structure&quot;. It
      includes material things (tools, instruments, etc.), the most various
      human organizations, furthermore, strictly coordinated systems of ideas
      and forms; furthermore, vague, non-coordinated thoughts and feelings;
      finally, an ideology &quot;of the second degree&quot;, sciences of
      sciences, sciences of arts, etc. We are therefore obliged, in 8t precise
      analysis, to resort to a certain definition of terms.</p>
    
    <p>We shall interpret the word &quot;superstructure&quot; as meaning any
      type of social phenomenon erected on the economic basis: this will
      include, for instance, social psychology, the social-political order, with
      all its material parts (for example, cannons), the organization of persons
      (official hierarchy), as well as such phe. nomena as language and thought.
      The conception of the superstructure is therefore the widest possible
      conception.</p>
    
    <p>The term &quot;social ideology&quot; will mean for us the system of
      thoughts, feelings, or rules of conduct (norms), and will therefore
      include such phenomena as the content of science (not a telescope, or the
      personal staff of a chemical laboratory) and art, the totality of norms,
      customs, morals, etc,</p>
    
    <p>Social psychology will mean for us the non-systematized or but little
      systematized feelings, thoughts and moods found in the given society,
      class, group, profession, etc.</p>
    
    <p><a name="e"></a></p>
    
    <h4>e. Social Psychology and Social Ideology</h4>
    
    <p>In our treatment of science and art, law and morality, etc., we were
      dealing with certain unified <i>systems </i>of forms, thoughts, rules of
      conduct, etc. Science is a unified, coordinated system of thoughts,
      embracing any subject of knowledge in its harmony. Art is a system of
      feelings, sensations, forms. Morality is a more or less rigid coordination
      of rules of conduct giving inner satisfaction to the individual. Many
      other ideologies may be similarly defined. But social life also includes a
      great mass of incoherent, non-coordinated material, by no means presenting
      an appearance of harmony, for instance, &quot;ordinary, everyday thought&quot;
      on any subject, as distinguished from &quot;scientific thought&quot;. The
      former is based on fragments of knowledge, on disorderly, scattered
      thoughts; it is a mass of contradictions, or incompletely digested
      notions, freakish conceptions. Only when this material has been subjected
      to the sharp test of criticism, and stripped of its contradictions, do we
      begin to approach science. But, alas, we live in &quot;every-day&quot;
      life! Among the countless mutual interactions between men, out of which
      social life is built up, there are many such non-coordinated elements:
      shreds of ideas (yet expressing a certain knowledge), feelings and wishes,
      tastes, modes of thought, undigested, &quot;semi-conscious&quot;, &quot;vague
      conceptions of God&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, &quot;just&quot; and &quot;unjust&quot;,
      &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;ugly&quot;, habits and views of daily
      life; impressions and conceptions as to the course of social life;
      feelings of pleasure or pain, dissatisfaction and anger, love of conflict
      or boundless despair, many vague expectations and ideals; a sharp critical
      attitude toward the existing order of things, or a delighted acceptance of
      this &quot;best of all worlds&quot;; a sense of failure and
      disappointment, cares as to the future, a bold burning one's bridges
      behind one, illusions, hopes of the future, etc., <i>etc., ad infinitum.
      </i>These phenomena, when <i>of social </i>dimensions, are the <i>social
      </i>psychology. The difference between the social (or &quot;collective&quot;)
      psychology and ideology is merely in their degree of systematization. The
      social psychology has often been apparent in bourgeois society in the
      mysterious envelope of the so called &quot;popular spirit&quot; or
      Zeitgeist, frequently conceived as a peculiar single social soul, in the
      literal sense of the word. But, of course, a <i>folk-soul, </i>in this
      sense, does not exist, any more than there can exist a society which is an
      organism with a single center of consciousness. Society then becomes a
      huge monster lying in the midst of nature</p>
    
    <p>In the absence of such an organism, we can hardly speak of a mysterious
      folk-soul or a &quot;popular spirit&quot;, in this mystical sense. Yet we
      do speak of the <i>social </i>psychology, to distinguish it from the
      individual psychology. This apparent contradiction may be answered as
      follows: the mutual interaction between men produces a certain psychology
      in the <i>individual. </i>The &quot;social&quot; element exists not
      between men but in the brains of men; the contents of these brains are a
      product of the various conflicting influences, the various intersecting
      interactions. No mental life exists except that which is found in the
      individual &quot;socialized&quot; human being, who is subject to all such
      interactions; society is an aggregate of socialized humans and not a huge
      beast of whom the individual humans are the various organs.</p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">G. Simmel excellently describes this: &quot;When a
      crowd of people destroy a house, pronounce a judgment, utter a cry, we
      here have a summation of the actions of the individual persons,
      constituting a single event recognized as a realization of a <i>single
      </i>conception. A frequent confusion takes place here: the <i>single </i>physical
      <i>result of many, </i>subjective mental processes is interpreted as the
      result of a single <i>mental process, namely, a process in the collective
      soul&quot; </i>(G. Simmel: S<i>oziologie; Untersuchungen über
      die Formen der Vergesellschaftung, </i>Leipzig, 1908, pp.559 560). Or - to
      use another example - when some new and greater thing than their
      individual aspirations or actions arises from the mutual interaction of
      men, &quot;when examined closely &quot; we find that such cases also
      involve the conduct of <i>individuals, </i>who are influenced by the fact
      that each is surrounded by other individuals; this results in nervous,
      intellectual, suggestive, moral transformations of man's mental
      constitution as compared with its operation with regard to different
      situations, in which such influences are absent. If these influences,
      mutually interacting, produce an internal modification in all the members
      of the group, in a like direction, their total action <i>will </i>no
      doubt have a different aspect from that of each individual, if each had
      been placed in a different, isolated situation&quot; <i>(ibid</i>.,
      p.560).</font></p>
    
    <p>Yet such words as <i>Zeitgeist, popular mood</i>, etc., are not without
      meaning: they indicate the existence of two conditions that may be noted
      everywhere: they indicate the real existence, first, of a certain
      predominant current of thoughts, feelings, moods, a prevailing psychology,
      at any given time, giving color to the entire social life; second, the
      alteration of this prevailing psychology according to the &quot;character
      of the epoch&quot;, i.e., according to the conditions of social evolution.</p>
    
    <p>The prevailing social psychology involves two principal elements: first,
      <i>general psychological traits, </i>perhaps found in all classes of
      society, for the situations of the various classes may have certain common
      elements in spite of class differences; second, the psychology of the
      ruling class, which enjoys such prominence in society as to set the pace
      for the entire social life and subject the other classes to its influence.
      The former case is illustrated in the feudal eras, in which the feudal
      lord and the peasant present certain common psychological traits: love of
      traditional practices, routine, submission to authority, fear of God,
      generally backward ideas, suspicion of innovation, etc. This results from
      the fact that both classes live in a stagnant and almost inert society;
      the more mobile psychology is later developed in the cities. Another cause
      of this condition is the unlimited authority enjoyed by the feudal lord on
      his estate and by the peasant in his family. The family then was an
      organized labor unit; in fact, the labor bond remains an important element
      in the peasant family to this day. The authority of the feudal lord is
      therefore found paralleled in the patriarchal order of labor relations in
      the family, as expressed in the complete submission to the &quot;head of
      the family&quot;: &quot;the old man knows!&quot; At a certain stage of
      social evolution, the <i>Zeitgeist </i>was a conservatism of feudal
      nobility and peasant serf. In addition, of course, the prevailing social
      psychology also presents factors characteristic of the feudal lords alone,
      which were disseminated only by virtue of the dominant position of the
      feudal nobility.</p>
    
    <p>Much oftener, however, we encounter cases in which the social
      'psychology, i.e., the prevailing social psychology, is that of the ruling
      class. In the second chapter of the <i>Communist Manifesto, </i>Marx
      says: &quot;The prevailing ideas of a period have always been simply the
      ideas of the ruling class.&quot; The same might be said of the social
      psychology prevalent at a given time. Our discussion of ideologies has
      already shown a number of examples of feelings, thoughts, moods,
      predominant in society. Let us examine a specific case: the psychology of
      the Renaissance, with its highly developed pursuit of pleasure, its
      parading of Latin and Greek words, its ingenious erudition, its love of
      distinguishing one's own ego from the &quot;mob&quot;; its elegant
      contempt for medieval superstition, etc.; this psychology obviously has
      nothing in common with that of the Italian <i>peasantry </i>of the same
      epoch; but was a product of the commercial cities, and of the <i>financial
      </i>cities, of the <i>financial-commercial aristocracy </i>in those
      cities. At precisely this period, <i>the </i>city began to control the
      provinces; the cities were ruled by bankers, who married into the families
      of the prominent nobility. The psychology of this class was the ruling
      psychology; it is expressed in many monuments - literary and other
      monuments - of the epoch. The development of the productive forces among
      <i>the </i>ruling class causes mighty levers to be fashioned for molding
      <i>the </i>psychology of the other classes. &quot;The three or four
      metropolitan sheets will, in our future, determine the opinion of the
      provincial papers and therefore the <i>popular will</i>&quot;, is the
      frank statement of Oswald Spengler,<sup class="anote"><a href="#31" name="31b">31)</a></sup>
      the philosopher of the German bourgeoisie of the present day.</p>
    
    <p>Yet, it is obvious that no <i>permanent, </i>uniform, integral &quot;social
      psychology&quot; may exist in a class society; at most there are certain
      common traits, whose importance should not be exaggerated.</p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">The same applies to so called &quot;national
      characteristics&quot;, &quot;race psychology&quot;, etc. It goes without
      saying that Marxists do not &quot;in principle&quot; deny the possibility
      of certain common traits in all the classes of one and the same nation. In
      one passage, for instance, Marx even allows for a certain influence of
      race, in the following words: &quot;The same economic basis - the same in
      its principal conditions - may present infinite variations and gradations
      in their manifestation, owing to countless different empirical
      circumstances, natural conditions, racial relations, historical influences
      working from without, etc., which cannot be understood without analyzing
      these empirically given circumstances&quot; (Marx: <i>Capital, </i>vol,
      iii). In other words, if any two societies are passing through the same
      stage of civilization (feudalism, let us say), they will nevertheless
      present certain (perhaps unimportant special traits. These special traits
      are the result of certain deviations: in the conditions of evolution, as
      well as of the special conditions of evolution in the <i>past, </i>It
      would be absurd to <i>deny </i>such peculiarities, as it is impossible to
      deny certain peculiarities in the &quot;national character,&quot; &quot;temperament,&quot;
      etc. To be sure, the presence of a class <i>psychology</i> may by no
      means be taken as a proof of certain special &quot;national&quot; traits
      (Marx, for instance, spoke of the philosophy of Bentham as a &quot;specifically
      English&quot; phenomenon; Engels described the socialism <i>of </i>the
      economist Rodbertus as a &quot;Prussian junker socialism,&quot; etc.). We
      may therefore also agree with Dr. E. Hurwicz - now Cunow's
      companion-in-arms in the noble task of destroying the Bolsheviks - when he
      writes: &quot;Vocational psychology does not exclude the possibility of
      national psychology&quot;, and &quot;the psychology of caste does not
      differ in this respect from the local psychology: neither precludes the
      possibility of a national psychology&quot; (E. Hurwicz: <i>Die Seelen der
      Völker, </i>Gotha 1920, pp.14, 15). But the facts are these: Marxists
      <i>explain </i>these national traits on the basis of the actual course of
      social evolution; they do not merely point at them; in the second place,
      they <i>do</i> not overestimate these peculiarities, or remain oblivious
      of the forest because of its many trees, while the worshipers of &quot;national
      psycholy,&quot; etc., lose sight of the forest altogether; in the third
      place, they do not set down the absurd things cooked up by learned and
      unlearned babblers and philistines on the subject of the &quot;national
      soul&quot;. Everyone knows, for example, that any Russian philistine
      considers philistinism to be a permanent and immutable quality of the
      Germans; yet the German workers are now proving that such is not the case.
      We all know also how much humbug has been written about the &quot;Slavic
      spirit&quot;. When Hurwicz exclaims with rapture that Bolshevism is merely
      a topsy-turvy Tsarism, that the government methods in both cases are the
      same, etc., he reveals to us not the properties of the <i>&quot;Russian
      </i>spirit&quot;, allegedly responsible for this similarity, but the
      qualities of the spirit of an international <i>petty bourgeois, </i>now
      serving <i>as a </i>prop to the Social-Democratic parties.</font></p>
    
    <p><i>The class psychology is based on the aggregate of the conditions of
      life in the classes concerned, and these conditions are determined by the
      position of the classes in the economic and social political environment.
      </i>But the intricacy of any social psychology must not be overlooked. For
      example, similarities of <i>form</i> may be found in quite different
      class psychologies; thus, two classes engaged in a life and death struggle
      with each other of course represent an entirely different content of
      feelings, aspirations, impressions, illusions, etc., while the form of
      their psychology may quite similar: passionate zeal, furious and fanatical
      aggression, even their specific forms of heroic psychology.</p>
    
    <p>The fact that the class psychology is determined by the totality of the
      conditions of the class life, based on the general economic situation,
      should not lead us to ascribe the class psychology to selfish interest,
      which is a very frequent error. No doubt class interest is the main sinew
      of the class struggle, but class psychology includes many other elements.
      We have already observed that the philosophers of the ruling class in the
      period of the decline of the Roman Empire preached self-extermination with
      some success, because their preaching was an outgrowth of the psychology
      of this class, a psychology of repletion, satiety, of disgust with life.
      The causes for this psychology may be definitely traced; we have already
      found its roots in the parasitic rô1e of the ruling class, which did
      nothing and merely lived in order to consume, to try out, to surfeit
      itself with all things, as was natural in view of its economic situation,
      its function (or lack of function) in the general economy. The psychology
      of satiety and necromania was a class psychology. Yet we may not say that
      Seneca, when he preached suicide, was expressing the interest of his
      class.<sup class="anote"><a href="#32" name="32b">32)</a></sup> The
      hunger strikes in the Tsarist prisons, for example, were acts in the class
      struggle, a protest in order to fan the flame of conflict, a symbol of
      solidarity, a device to maintain the ranks of the fighters, and this
      struggle was dictated by class interests. At times, despair seizes the
      masses or certain groups, after a great defeat in the class struggle,
      which is of course connected with class interest, but the connection is
      somewhat peculiar: the conflict went on under the impulse of the hidden
      springs of interest, but now the fighting army has been defeated; the
      result is: disintegration, despair, a longing for miracles, a desire to
      escape mankind; thoughts turn heavenward.<sup class="anote"><a href="#33" name="33b">33)</a></sup>
      After the defeat of the great insurrections in Russia in the Seventeenth
      Century, which had taken the form of religious dissent, &quot;protest
      assumed many varied forms under the influence of defeat and despair&quot;:
      retirement to the wilderness, self-incineration. &quot;Hundreds, even
      thousands, seek their death in the flames .... ecstatic dreamers clothe
      themselves in pure funereal raiment and lie down in the coffins that have
      already been prepared, to wait for the crack of doom.&quot;
      <sup class="anote"><a href="#34" name="34b">34)</a></sup> This
      psychology also finds expression in the two contemporary poems quoted by
      Melgunov</p>
    
    <p class="fst"><font size="-1">Dear Mother Desert,<br>
       Release me from earth's sufferings,<br>
       Receive me in your arms,<br>
       Dear Mother Desert,<br>
       Kind Mother, keep me.</font></p>
    
    <p>and:</p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">Coffin of pine-wood,<br>
       There will I lie,<br>
       Waiting for the last trump.</font></p>
    
    <p>It is obvious that the phenomenon of class psychology is of very
      complicated nature, not capable of direct interpretation as <i>interest
      </i>only, but <i>always to be explained by the concrete environment in
      which the specific class has been placed.</i></p>
    
    <p>In the psychological structure of society, <i>i.e., </i>among the
      various forms of the social psychology, we must not omit to mention the
      psychologies of groups, occupations, etc. There may be several groups
      within one class; thus, the bourgeoisie includes a bourgeoisie of high
      finance, a trading bourgeoisie and an industrial bourgeoisie; the working
      class includes the aristocracy of skilled labor, together with slightly
      skilled labor and wholly unskilled labor. Each of these groups has special
      interests and special characteristics; thus, the highly skilled worker
      likes his work and is even proud of being superior, as a worker, to the
      others; on the other hand, he is ambitious, and assumes certain bourgeois
      inclinations, together with his high collar. Each occupation bears its
      mark; when we berate the bureaucrats, we mean a certain professional
      psychology of negative virtue: routine, red-tape delays, precedence of
      form over substance, etc. Vocational types of psychology arise, their 
      mental traits a direct result of the character of their activity, whence
      follows also a corresponding tinge in their ideology. Friedrich Engels
      says: &quot;Among the practical politicians and the theorists in
      jurisprudence, and among the jurists in particular, this fact is first
      completely lost sight of. Since in each single instance the economic facts
      must take the form of juristic motives so as to be sanctioned in the form
      of law, and since, therefore, a backward view must be taken over the whole
      existing system of law, it follows therefrom (in the opinion of these
      persons, N. B.) that the juristic form appears to be the whole and the
      economic content nothing at all.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#35" name="35b">35)</a></sup>
      His trade psychology will quickly betray a man; a minute's conversation
      will tell you whether you are dealing with a clerk, a butcher, a reporter,
      etc. It is a characteristic fact that all these traits are international;
      you find them everywhere. By the side of the class psychology, which is
      the plainest, most pregnant and most significant form of the social
      psychology, we find a group psychology, a vocational psychology, etc.;
      being determines consciousness. In this sense we may say that each
      grouping of men-even in an amateur chess club or chorus-imparts a
      certain-sometimes almost imperceptible -stamp on its members. <i>But
      since the existence of a certain grouping of persons is nevertheless
      always associated with the economic structure of society, being ultimately
      dependent on the latter, it follows that all the varieties of the social
      psychology are quantities to be explained by the social mode of
      production, the economic structure of society.</i></p>
    
    <p>What is the relation between the social psychology and the social
      ideology? The social psychology is a sort of supply-chamber for ideology;
      or, it may be compared with a salt solution out of which the ideology is
      crystallized. At the beginning of this section, we stated that the
      ideology is distinguished by the great <i>coordination </i>of its
      elements, <i>i.e., </i>the various feelings, thoughts, sensations, forms,
      of which it is composed. The ideology systematizes that which has hitherto
      been not systematized, <i>i.e., </i>the social psychology. The <i>ideologies
      are a coagulated social psychology</i>. For example, early in the history
      of the workers' movement, there was a certain crude discontent among the
      working class, a sense of the &quot;injustice&quot; of the capitalist
      order, a vague desire to replace this system by some other system; we
      could not call this an ideology. Later, however, this vague tendency was
      definitely formulated. Things were coordinated, a set of demands (a
      program, platform) arose, a specific &quot;ideal&quot; began to appear,
      idealism, etc.; here we have an <i>ideology. </i>Or, we may find that the
      discomforts of a situation, and the aspiration to cast it off, find
      expression in a work of art; here also we have an ideology. It is
      sometimes difficult to draw the line sharply; the actual process is a slow
      solidification, consolidation, crystallization of the social ideology out
      of the social psychology. A change in the social psychology will of course
      result in a corresponding change in the social ideology, as we have
      pointed out above. The social psychology is constantly changing,
      simultaneously with the alterations in the economic conditions from which
      they grow, for the latter bring about a constant regrouping of these
      social forces, a growth of new relations, based on the successively
      altered levels of the productive forces as has been already point out.</p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">Having given a number of examples in our discussion of
      ideology, we need not dwell upon the alterations in social
      psychology as connected with the alterations in ideology; we shall merely
      point out that the latest books are now devoting considerable attention to
      the question of the so called &quot;spirit of capitalism&quot;, ix., the
      psychology of the entrepreneurs. For instance, the works of Werner Sombart
      <i>(Der Bourgeois, </i>etc.), Max Weber, and more recently Professor Dr.
      Hermann Levy <i>(Soziologische Studien über das englische Volk</i>,
      Jena 1920). Marx wrote, in the First Volume of <i>Capital: </i>&quot;Protestanism,
      by changing almost all the traditional holidays into workdays, plays an
      important part in the genesis of capital&quot; (Chicago, 1915, p.303,
      footnote) Marx repeatedly points out that the bigoted, frugal,
      parsimonious, and at the same time energetic and persistent mentality of
      Protestanism, abhorring the pomp and luxury of Rome, is identical with the
      mentality of the rising bourgeoisie. People poked fun at this statement;
      but now prominent bourgeois scholars are developing this very theory of
      Marx, of course without giving credit to its originator. Sombart proves
      that the most varied traits (avarice for gold, untiring lust for
      adventure, inventive spirit, combined with calculation, reason, sobriety)
      gave rise to the so called capitalist spirit&quot; by reason of their
      united presence. It goes without saying that this spirit could not have
      developed out of itself, but was shaped by an alteration in the social
      relations; parallel with the growth of the capitalist &quot;body&quot;
      proceeded a growth of the capitalist &quot;spirit&quot;. All the
      fundamental traits of the economic psychology are reversed: in the
      pre-capitalist era, the basic economic notion of the nobility was that of
      a &quot;decent&quot; life, &quot;according to station&quot;. &quot;Money
      exists in order to be spent,&quot; wrote Thomas Aquinas; things were
      managed poorly, irrationally, without proper bookkeeping; tradition and
      routine predominated; the tempo of life was slow (almost every other day a
      holiday) initiative and energy were lacking. On the other hand, the
      capitalist psychology, which replaced the feudal-chivalrous psychology, is
      based on initiative, energy, briskness, rejection of routine, rational
      calculation and reflection, love of accumulating riches, etc. The complete
       upheaval in men's minds proceeded simultaneously with the complete
      upheaval in the production relations.</font></p>

    <h4>f. The Ideological Processes considered as differentiated labour</h4>
    
    <p>The question of ideologies and of the superstructure in general must
      also be considered from another standpoint. We have already seen that the
      various forms of the superstructure are a composite quantity, by the
      nature of their construction, and include things as well as persons; the
      ideologies themselves are a sort of mental product. This being the case,
      we necessarily consider the forms of the superstructure in their evolution
      (and consequently also the ideological process) as a special <i>form of
      social labor (but not of material production; </i>the two must not be
      confused) In the beginnings of &quot;human history&quot;, i.e., at the
      time when surplus labor did not exist, we find practically no ideology.
      Only later as surplus labor arises, &quot;a class which is relieved of
      directly productive labor is formed by the side of the great rnajority
      which does nothing but toil; this new class takes care of the common
      concerns of society: supervision of labor, affairs of state, justice,
      sciences, arts, etc. Therefore, we find at the basis of the division into
      classes: the law of the division of labor&quot; (Friedrich Engels: <i>Die
      Entwicklung der Sozialismus von der Utopie zur Wissenschaft, </i>Berlin,
      1920, p.49) In one passage, Marx designates priests, lawyers, the ruling
      classes, etc., as the &quot;ideological classes&quot;. In other words, the
      ideological processes may be considered as a specific form of labor within
      the general labor system. This labor is not material production, nor does
      it constitute a portion of this material production, but results from the
      latter, as our study of ideologies has shown, and sets up an independent
      domain of social activity. The increasing division of labor is an
      expression of the increasing pro ductive forces of society, wherefore the
      growth of the pro ductive forces conditions also a division of labor in
      the field of production, accompanied by an isolation of the ideological
      labor having its own division of labor. &quot;The division of labor is not
      a characteristic of the economic world; its growing influence may be
      observed in the most varied fields of society, in the increasing
      specialization of political, administrative, legal functions. The same
      thing may be observed in art and science.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#36" name="36b">36)</a></sup>
      We may now view the whole of society as a huge working mechanism, with
      many subdivisions of the divided social labor. This great labor aggregate
      may be divided into two great categories, first, material labor, &quot;production&quot;
      as such; second, the various forms of labor in the superstructure, the
      work of supervision, etc., as well as <i>ideological </i>labor as such,
      The organization of this labor goes hand in hand with the organization of
      material labor, and is along the same general lines; it includes a class
      hierarchy, those holding the means of production being at the top, and
      those without such means at the bottom. In the process of material
      production (1) those in charge have a special role in this process, which
      is (2) determined by the fact that the means of production are in their
      hands, and (3) they also have control of distribution by virtue of this
      circumstance; such also is the case in almost all the branches of &quot;superstructural&quot;
      labor. The army has already served as an illustration; the same might be
      noted in science and art. A great technical laboratory, under capitalist
      society, has an internal organization similar to that in the factory. The
      theatre, under capitalism, has its owner, its manager, its actors, its &quot;supes&quot;;
      its technical employees, its clerks, workers, just as in a factory. We
      consequently find here, (<i>i.e., </i>in a class society) various
      functions <i>socially connected </i>with <i>these persons; </i>the
      higher function involves, so to say, a possession of the &quot;means of
      mental production&quot;, constituting a class monopoly; in the
      distribution of the products of <i>material </i>production (men live, of
      course, by consuming material commodities), the possessors of these &quot;instruments
      of mental production&quot; obtain a greater share of the social product
      than their subordinates.</p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">We know how firmly the ruling classes have clung to the
      monopoly of knowledge. In antiquity, the priests who held this monopoly
      barred the &quot;temples of science&quot;, to which they admitted but a
      few chosen ones; knowledge itself was enveloped in the shroud of a
      divinely awful mystery, accessible to only a few of the wise and just. The
      store set by this monopoly by the ruling classes is apparent, for example,
      from the following words of the well-known German idealist philosopher, F.
      Paulsen: &quot;Anyone whose social conditions force him to remain a manual
      worker by trade and status, would not find it a gain to have received the
      schooling of a scholar; such training would not enhance, but darken his
      life&quot; (Friedrich Paulsen: <i>Das moderne Bildungswesen, </i>in <i>Kultur
      der Gegenwart, </i>part i, section i, p.24; we may observe in passing that
      this gigantic work, the <i>Kultur der Gegenwart - </i>a product of the
      finest brains among the German professors - is dedicated to Emperor
      William II!). Apparently the honored philosopher and idealist regards a
      man as bound down to the compulsory labor of capitalism, even in his
      mother's womb, and deprives him of education even before he has seen the
      light of the sun.</font></p>
    
    <p>The monopoly character of education was the principal reason for the
      opposition of the Russian intellectuals to the revolution of the
      proletariat; conversely, one of the principal achievements of the
      proletarian revolution was the abolition of this monopoly.</p>
    
    <p>: An inspection of material production will show that it is divided into
      a number of branches; in the first place, into manufacturing and
      agriculture, both of which are further subdivided into a great number of
      sections, from mining operations and grain-growing to the manufacture of
      pins and the raising of lettuce. Here, as in the &quot;superstructure&quot;,
      there are large subdivisions (such as those previously considered, i.e.,
      administration, the setting of standards, of science, of art, of religion,
      of philosophy, etc.); furthermore, each of these subdivisions is further
      ramified (for instance, science now consists of many branches; so does
      art). In material production, as we have seen, a certain rough proportion
      must exist - if society is to go on - between the various branches of
      production. Even in a blind, capitalist social order, with no social plan
      of production at all, but rather with anarchy in production, i.e., a
      disproportion between the various branches of production, even here we
      find a constant adjustment within this anarchy; violent disturbances of
      this proportion meet with their reaction, of course, not without much
      pain, and not for long periods, but there is a certain temporary
      equilibrium, for otherwise capitalist society would go to pieces as the
      result of a single industrial crisis. While it is possible for a society
      to exist in spite of the fact that there is no harmony between its
      material production and the other forms of its labor, the non-material
      forms, such a society will not grow but decline. For instance, where too
      much labor is allotted to the maintenance of theaters, the government
      mechanism, or the church, or art, the productive forces themselves will
      decline. It is obvious that this would be the case, for instance, in a
      community in which there was one worker and seven men supervising and
      calculating his product, with two others encouraging him by singing, and
      another man governing the whole process. Since all must eat, it is obvious
      that such a labor system would not endure for long. But it is also quite
      obvious that - in spite of all the effort the workers might put in - a
      working community would fare very badly unless its various members formed
      a coordinated system, in which their product was duly tabulated, and in
      which certain individuals took care of relations with the outside world.
      Therefore, if society as a whole is to endure, there must exist within it
      a certain condition of equilibrium (though it be unstable) between the
      material work as a whole and the superstructural work as a whole. Let us
      assume for a moment that all the scholars (mathematicians, engineers,
      chemists, physicists, etc.) in the United States of America should
      disappear overnight; the huge production of that country could not go on,
      based as it is, on scientific calculation, but would decline. Let us
      assume, on the other hand, that 99 per cent. of the present workers should
      suddenly be miraculously transformed into learned mathematicians, not
      participating in production. The resulting bankruptcy would be complete;
      society would perish. Not only is a certain proportion (even though its
      limits be indefinite) necessary in any society between the total material
      labor and the total superstructural labor, but the distribution of labor
      within the superstructure, i.e., among the various forms of the &quot;mental&quot;
      supervising and other activity, is also of importance. As there is a
      certain equilibrium between the various forms of material labor (these
      various forms tend to equilibrium, as Marx puts it), so there must be a
      certain modicum of such equilibrium between the branches of ideological
      work, in fact, of the &quot;superstructural&quot; work in general. The
      coordination of these ideological &quot;branches of production&quot; is
      ultimately determined by the economic structure of society. Why, for
      instance, was so vast a quantity of national labor in ancient Egypt
      devoted to the construction of the huge pyramids, great Pharaonic statues,
      and other monuments of feudal art? For the simple reason that Egyptian
      society could not have maintained itself without constantly impressing
      upon the slaves and peasants the sublimity and the divine power of their
      rulers. In the absence of newspapers and telegraph agencies, art served as
      the ideological bond; it was therefore a <i>sine qua non </i>for this
      society and took an enormous share of the country's labor budget.
      Similarly, &quot;ethics&quot;, the establishment of moral standards,
      assumed a very important place in Greece at the end of the Fifth Century
      B.C, because the question of the relations between men and of the
      regulation of these relations, had become particularly acute, even for the
      ruling classes, who were impelled by the great gulfs that had opened up,
      to seek to conciliate divergent tendencies. Art is but feebly developed in
      the United States of America of our day, while the same country is a 
      pioneer in the study and application of the science of organized
      production as a whole (the Taylor system, vocational psychology,
      psycho-physiology of labor, etc.), because American capitalism does not
      need to resort to art in order to mould the minds of the people; this task
      is excellently performed by a capitalist newspaper press that has been
      perfected to the point of virtuosity; the question of a national
      production, a &quot;scientific management&quot;, is of immense importance
      in the life of such a system.</p>
    
    <p>A certain proportion between the parts is therefore necessary in the
      field of &quot;superstructural&quot; (and consequently of any ideological)
      labor, so long as society is in a state of equilibrium, this proportion
      between the various branches of mental work, and their distribution, being
      determined by the economic structure of society and the requirements of
      its technology.</p>
    
    <p>An interesting application of these observations may be made to the<i>
      school, </i>which is one of the fields of ideological labor. Indeed,
      schools (universities, high schools, elementary schools) are the sphere of
      common social labor in which instruction is given, in which the labor
      forces are endowed with a certain skill, a specific &quot;training&quot;,
      simple human labor power being thus transformed into <i>specific </i>labor
      power. One person studies medicine, another <i>law, </i>military science,
      engineering, etc. The same condition of affairs is found throughout the
      field of instruction, <i>i.e., </i>all those special processes in which
      specific abilities are imparted to men, which are required for the
      performance of more or less specialized functions; essentially there is no
      difference between the trade school that turns out locksmiths, and the
      educational institution that turns out the geniuses of the pulpit,
      or the Tsarist cadet school, producing its crack officers. It follows
      that: the school system, its division into various branches (commercial
      schools, trade schools, cadet schools, schools of engineering,
      universities, <i>etc.) are an expression of society's need for various
      kinds of skilled - material and mental-labor.</i></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">A few examples will clarify our thought.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">In the Middle Ages, the school stood in the sign of the
      priesthood. Feudal society could not exist without a tremendous
      development of religion. Therefore: &quot;The monastic and cathedral
      schools and the overwhelming number of chancellor universities, the life
      in the bursae, and the instruction in the artistic faculty - all these had
      a monastic priestly tinge, everything having been devised and arranged
      according to the ecclesiastical theological spirit&quot; (Theobald
      Ziegler: <i>Geschichte der Pädagogik, </i>in <i>Handbuch der
      Erziehungs- und Unterrichtslehre für höhere Schüler, vol.
      </i>i, Miinchen 1895, P. 33). &quot;Except the few medical and legal
      professional schools, the universities as well as the lower schools were
      concerned above all with the <i>training of clerics&quot; </i>(ibid.). In
      addition, there were schools for training knights; in these, &quot;education&quot;
      no longer served to develop priestly &quot;labor power&quot;, but brightly
      &quot;labor power&quot;. The boys were instructed chiefly in seven virtues
      <i>(probitates); these </i>were &quot;the seven <i>probitates </i>of the
      knight, six of them being purely physical arts <i>(equitare, natare,
      sagittare, cestibus certare, aucupari, scacis ludere: </i>riding,
      swimming, archery, fencing, hunting, chess-playing) and the remaining one,
      <i>versificare, </i>poetry and music&quot; (<i>ibid</i>.). Obviously,
      this must have produced a different type of man, necessary for feudal
      society.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">But now we have the growth of cities, the commercial
      bourgeoisie, etc.; the result of this condition is well described by
      Professor Ziegler, whom we have already quoted: &quot;But (p.34) new
      educational needs arise in another field. In the blossoming cities, the
      <i>merchant </i>and the <i>artisan </i>(my italics. N.B.) required a
      different practical education than was given to the scholar or judge; the
      erection of schools by the city was resorted to, for the purpose of
      providing these circles with the necessary important instruction.&quot;</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">With the development of industrial capitalism and the
      increasing demand for skilled labor, the so called trade school is born in
      the field of material labor. &quot;In order to support the national
      industry, governments and private persons began to establish trade and
      artisan schools, destined to provide such vocational instruction to the
      pupils as they had formerly obtained in the master's shop&quot; (N.
      Krupskaya: <i>Popular Education and Democracy</i>, Moscow, 1921, p.94.,
      in Russian). This school undergoes certain changes with the growth of <i>large-scale
      </i>industry, and the increasing demand for masters, supervisors, foremen,
      etc. (<i>ibid</i>., p.96). Simultaneously, the intermediate schools and
      higher trade schools, giving more prominence to natural science and
      mathematics, now flourish on a very large scale, also commercial
      universities, agricultural schools, etc</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">The above cited German idealist philosopher, F.
      Paulsen, expounds the significance of capitalist education with frank
      brutality. These passages in his work are so instructive and give so
      precise a picture, that we must present them unabridged (Paulsen's
      frankness may be explained by the fact that he is contributing to a thick
      and heavy volume which will not fall into the hands of the workers; he
      therefore writes for the capitalist bandits only, and can afford to tell 
      tales out of school)</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The actual outline of the educational system is
      determined everywhere, in the main, by the outline of society and its
      stratification. . . The form of the public educational system will always
      reflect the condition of the society producing it. Society shows
      everywhere a double stratification: a grouping according to the form of
      the social performance of labor, and a grouping by property relations. The
      first grouping furnishes the division into vocational stations; the 
      difference in property gives rise to the division into social classes.
      Both have an influence on the educational system; the main outlines of the
      social performance of labor, the vocational social station, determine on
      the whole the varieties of instructional type; <i>the class membership or
      the property standing of their families to a great extent determines the
      distribution of young men to the various courses. . </i>. It (society)
      needs and has motor, executive, and mentally operating and guiding
      functions and organs. The first group includes all those whose labor
      achievement is essentially that of bodily strength and manual dexterity;
      here we should place the industrial workers and artisans of all kinds,
      rural workers and small peasants, and, lastly, those employed in trade and
      transportation as the lowest executive instruments. The second, group
      includes those whose vocational task essentially is that of controlling
      the social labor process and giving instructions and guidance to manual
      laborers; here belong the factory owners and technical specialists,
      managers of great farms, merchants and bankers, higher employees in trade
      and transportation, also subaltern officials in the service of nation and
      community. The third group, finally, includes those professions
      customarily classed as &quot;learned&quot;; their practice requires an
      independent grasping and extending of scientific knowledge: here belong
      research workers and inventors, also the incumbents of the higher places
      in the civil and military service, in church and school, physicians,
      engineers in high position, etc.&quot; (Paulsen, in <i>Kultur der
      Gegenwart, </i>part i, section i, pp.64, 65). The grading of the schools
      corresponds to these three groups. Paulsen's statements are an excellent
      indication of the school mechanism: on the one hand, it provide the
      necessary number of labor forces for each material and mental task; on the
      other hand, the higher ideological functions always remain fixed to a
      certain class, the educational monopoly, and with it the capitalist order
      of society, being thus maintained. But Paulsen is wrong in placing himself
      and his ilk <i>over </i>the manufacturers and bankers whose boots the
      learned gentlemen lick on all necessary and unnecessary, occasions.</font></p>
    
    <p>Thus the school illustrates the practical roots of all ideologies. If
      any mathematician should be indignant at our suggesting that his &quot;pure
      science&quot; has any earthly import, we shall merely ask him to inform us
      why mathematics is studied by the merchants' sons in the commercial high
      schools, the would-be agronomists in the agricultural schools, the
      would-be engineers in the engineering schools, etc. He may reply that only
      the riff-raff of the profession would consent to give them instruction; we
      should then ask him why `pure mathematicians - who really seem quite
      ignorant of practical life - should deliver lectures before persons
      preparing for the professions of engineering or agriculture. Our
      mathematician may go so far as to say that there are some scholars that
      give no instruction, deliver no lectures. But surely - as we should then
      assert - these men write books which are read by professors who give
      instruction to future engineers who make use of what knowledge they
      acquire in order to calculate problems in the construction of bridges,
      steam-boilers, electrical power stations, etc.</p>
    
    <p>Furthermore, the case of the school indicates the relative need of the
      specific society for various types of skilled labor, including the &quot;highest&quot;.</p>
    
    <p>The various sciences are therefore as much interconnected by the bond of
      labor as are the various branches of material labor. Likewise, the other
      branches of ideological labor are connected with the sciences, <i>all
      being based ultimately and constantly on</i> <i>material labor.</i></p>
    
    <p><a name="g"></a></p>
    
    <h4>g. The Significance of the Superstructure</h4>
    
    <p>We may now take up a more detailed study of the significance of all the
      varieties of the superstructure, including the ideologies, which may best
      be done in a critical examination of the objections commonly raised by the
      opponents of the theory of historical materialism.</p>
    
    <p>First, there are the objections to the practical roots of ideology, to
      the claim that the forms of the &quot;superstructure&quot;, including
      those of ideology, have any significance as services. We are told that
      scholars or artists very often are not concerned at all with the practical
      role played by their thoughts or constructions. On the contrary, the
      scholar, in his search for &quot;pure truth&quot;, is merely expressing
      his love of this goddess; his marriage to her is a love-match, based on no
      practical considerations of any kind. Similarly, we are told that the true
      artist loves art for art's sake. Art is his highest goal; art alone gives
      life meaning for him. As a. jurist may declare that he would wish to see
      the world destroyed; rather than that justice be not done (<i>fiat
      justitia, pereat mundus</i>!), so the true musician would give everything
      else in the world for a single glorious symphony. The true artist lives
      for his art, the, scholar for science, the jurist for the state (Hegel,
      for instance, considers the Prussian junker capitalist state to be the
      highest manifestation of the world-spirit in human history, and therefore
      worthy of receiving self-sacrifice), etc.</p>
    
    <p>Now, is it true that scholars and artists have this attitude, or are
      they pulling the wool over the eyes of the public? While the latter may
      sometimes occur, we have not the right to approach the subject from this
      angle. Thousands of examples prove that a true scholar, or artist, or
      theoretical jurist, loves his vocation as he loves himself, without regard
      to its practical phases. But it would be wrong to have the matter end
      there, <i>for the subject of the psychology of the ideologists is </i>not
      to be confused with their <i>objective role; </i>man's view of his labor
      is not identical with the role, the significance, of his labor for <i>society.
      </i>Let us examine the growth of an ideology. Mathematics, for instance -
      arose on the basis of practical needs - became specialized and divided off
      into a number of branches. The specialist is not aware of the practical
      needs satisfied by his science. He is interested in his &quot;own work&quot;;
      the more he loves it, the more productive will it be. Other persons,
      working in other fields, will apply his theory. Before the days of
      specialization, the practical significance of science was apparent to
      everyone; now it has been lost. Knowledge formerly served practice, even
      in men's minds; it still serves practice, but the minds of the closeted
      specialists represent knowledge as entirely divorced from practice. The
      causes are not far to seek; man's thinking is influenced by his being. To
      a man working in one ideological field only, this field must appear as the
      navel of the earth, about which all else revolves. This man lives in the
      atmosphere of his specialty, for - as Engels has excellently put it -
      ideology is simply the &quot;occupying oneself with thoughts as with
      independent entities developing independently, subject only to their own
      laws.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#37" name="37b">37)</a></sup>
      Before the days of specialization, a man might have thought: &quot;I guess
      I'll take up some geometry, in order to measure the fields down by the
      shore next year.&quot; But the mathematical specialist would probably say:
      &quot;I have got to solve this problem; it is my life-work.&quot; Somewhat
      different in expression, but identical in sense, is Ernst Mach's
      formulation of the case: &quot;For the artisan, and more still for the
      scientist, the quickest, simplest mental acquisition - with the slightest
      mental outlay - of a certain field of natural phenomena is <i>itself </i>an
      economic object, in which, <i>although it was originally a means to an
      end, there is now no longer a thought of physical need, </i>once the
      corresponding mental impulses have developed and demand exercise.&quot;
      <sup class="anote"><a href="#38" name="38b">38)</a></sup> Thus, the
      system of the superstructure, from the social-political to the
      philosophical phase inclusive, is connected with the Cmnomic basis and the
      technical system of the specific society, being a necessary link in the
      chain of social phenomena.</p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">In this connection, Engels says in a letter addressed
      to Franz Mehring, dated July 14, 1893: &quot;Ideology is a process
      accomplished, to be sure, by so called thought, but with a false
      consciousness. This mess does not know the actual motive forces behind it,
      otherwise it would not be an ideological process. Being a process of
      thought, it derives its content as well as its form from pure thought,
      either on its own part or on that of its predecessors. It works with mere
      mental material, which it assumes and accepts as the product of thought,
      and for which it does not seek any more remote process, that may be
      independent of thought, and all this is self-evident to this process, for
      it regards all action, since it works through thought, as also in the last
      instance based on thought &quot; This illusion of an independent history;
      of national constitutions, legal systems, ideological conceptions, in each
      special field of knowledge, is the element that leads most persons astray
      mentally&quot; (Mehring: <i>Geschichte der deutsehen Sozialdemokratie,
      </i>Note to Book i, Stuttgart 1919, p.386).</font></p>
    
    <p>Another frequent objection to our theory results from pretending that it
      declares economy to be the only true element in life, all other elements
      being childish folly, illusions, vague mists. This conception represents
      historical materialism as stating the existence of various factors in
      history: economy, politics, art, etc., some of which are very important,
      others unimportant, with the economic &quot;factor&quot; as the only real &quot;factor&quot;,
      all the others being a sort of fifth wheel of the wagon. This
      representation of the Marxian conception is then diligently bombarded with
      refutations; it is pointed out that many other things are important
      besides economy; but it would be erroneous to interpret our view of
      ideology in this way; the superstructure is not &quot;child's play&quot;.
      We have shown that a destruction of the capitalist state would make
      capitalist production impossible, that a destruction of modern science
      would involve also that of large-scale production and technology; that an
      elimination of the means of human intercourse, language and literature,
      would cause society to disintegrate. The theory of historical materialism
      does not deny the importance of the superstructure in general and of the
      ideologies, in particular, but explains them. As we have shown in our
      chapter on Determinism and Indeterminism this is quite a different
      attitude.</p>
    
    <p>It would be equally incorrect to consider the various &quot;factors&quot;
      from the point of view of their unequal value; to admit the importance of
      economy, but to belittle that of politics or science. Many
      misunderstandings result from such an interpretation. Why attempt to set
      up a scale of the relative importance, of these &quot;factors&quot; when
      we recall that capitalist economy could not exist without capitalist
      politics? It would be difficult to decide whether - in a rifle - the
      barrel or the trigger was the more important; or - in the human body - the
      left hand or the right foot; or - in a watch - the spring or the
      cog-wheel. Some things are more important than others; economy is more
      important than dancing; but in many cases it is absurd to make such a
      statement A system may contain sections that are of equal importance for
      the existence of the whole. The trigger is as important in a rifle as the
      barrel; a single screw in a piece of mechanism may be as important as any
      other part, for without it the mechanism might cease to be a mechanism.
      Similarly, in a consideration of the &quot;superstructural&quot; labor, as
      a portion of the total social labor, it would be equally absurd to ask
      either of the following questions: Which is more important for modern
      industry, metallurgy or mining? Which is more important, direct material
      labor, or labor in economic administration? At certain stages in
      evolution, the two may be inseparable. &quot;This theory (the theory of
      these factors, N. B.) played the same role in the evolution of social
      science. The progress of natural science has shown us the unity of these
      forces, the modern doctrine of energy. Likewise, the progress of social
      science has necessarily led to a displacement of the theory of factors -
      this product of social analysis - by a <i>synthetic conception of social
      life.&quot; </i><sup class="anote"><a href="#39" name="39b">39)</a></sup>
      We therefore reject the theory of factors. But there remains a basis for
      the distinction between material production and the superstructure, and
      for a study of their mutual relations.</p>
    
    <p>The true difference is in the different character of their functions.
      The administration of production does not play the same part as does
      production itself. The former eliminates, friction, systematizes and
      coordinates the various elements of work, or to put it differently -
      institutes a certain adjustment of work. We have also seen, for instance,
      that morality, customs, and other standards, coordinate men's actions and
      keep them within certain bounds, thus preventing society from
      disintegrating. Science likewise (let us suppose we are speaking of the
      natural sciences) ultimately serves as a guide for the process of
      production, increases its effectiveness and regulates its operation. We
      have defined the similar function of philosophy, which coordinates and
      regulates (or seeks to do so) the contradictions between the various
      sciences, due to their division of labor.</p>
    
    <p>Philosophy arises from the sciences, as the administration of production
      arises from production; neither is &quot;primary&quot;; both are &quot;secondary&quot;,
      neither &quot;original&quot;, both &quot;derivative&quot;; yet, philosophy
      controls the sciences, to a certain degree, for it imparts to them their &quot;common
      point of view&quot;, their &quot;method&quot;, etc.</p>
    
    <p>Another example that has already been treated is that of language; the
      latter grows out of production, develops under the influence of the social
      evolution, <i>i.e., </i>its evolution is determined by the natural law of
      social evolution. The function of language is to coordinate man's actions,
      for mutual understanding is the simplest form of adaptation, coordination,
      in relations, actions, even - to a certain extent - in feelings, etc. The
      fundamental import of the distinction between material production and
      ideological labor - or any other &quot;superstructural&quot; labor -
      should now be clear: Their mutual relation is in the fact that ideological
      labor is a derived quantity, also constituting a regulating principle.
      With regard to the whole of social life, the distinction lies in their
      <i>difference of functions.</i></p>
    
    <p>We have now practically answered also the question as to the reverse
      relation, &quot;the influence of the superstructure on the economic basis
      and on the productive forces of society&quot;. The superstructure, growing
      out of the economic conditions and the productive forces determining these
      conditions, in its turn, exerts an influence on the latter, favoring or
      retarding their growth. But, in either case, there is no doubt of this
      reverse process. In other words: <i>a constant process of mutual cause
      and affect is in operation between the various categories of social
      phenomena. </i>Cause and effect change place.</p>
    
    <p>But if we recognize this mutual influence, what becomes of the bases of
      Marxian theory? For most bourgeois scholars admit a mutual interaction.
      May we still say that the productive forces and the production conditions
      are the basis of our analysis? Are not our own hands destroying what they
      have built up? These doubts are quickly disposed of. However numerous
      these mutual, influences, the basic fact remains: <i>at any given moment
      the inner structure of society is determined by the mutual relation
      between this society and external nature, </i>i.e., <i>by the condition
      of the </i>ma<i>terial productive forces of society; the change in form,
      however, is determined by the movement of the productive forces. We </i>go;
      further than merely to admit the existence of a set of mutual relations,
      for we understand that all the countless processes at work within society,
      all their intersecting, colliding, accumulating forces and elements are
      operating within a common frame, provided by the mutual relation between
      society and nature. Perhaps our opponents will attempt to controvert this
      principle, already known to Goethe in its general outlines, and expressed
      by him in his poem, &quot;The Metamorphosis of Animals&quot;, a poem not
      so well known as his &quot;Metamorphosis of Plants&quot;.</p>

    <p>This thesis is irrefutable; it follows that our analysis must begin with
      the productive forces, that the countless mutual dependences between the
      various parts of society do not eliminate the basic, ultimate dependence
      of all social phenomena on the evolution of the productive forces; that
      the diversity of the causes operating in society does not contradict the
      existence of a <i>single unified causal relation in social evolution.</i></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">We cannot take up here the individual objections of the
      various bourgeois scholars; their number is legion. Essentially, they are
      all chewing the same old insipid cud. Let us take one of the latest &quot;critical&quot;
      essays as an example; Professor V. M. Khvostov expounds Marx's theory as
      follows, &quot;It consists on the whole (!) in assigning, among the
      historical factors (!), the chief place to the economic factor (!) . . .
      all other phenomena being shaped under the one-sided (1) influence of the
      economic conditions&quot; (Khvostov: <i>Theory of the Historical Process,
      </i>in Russian, p.315). After our recent remarks in large type, we need
      hardly to inform the reader whether Khvostov's conception of Marxian
      theory is a correct one. But, to do him justice, Mr. Khvostov constitutes
      no exception; on the contrary, the greater the erudition displayed in the
      refutation of Marx, the greater the 'ignorance displayed in expounding his
      doctrine.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">We shall take one more specimen of &quot;refutation&quot;
      (from the same professor): &quot;I believe(!) that man is characterized by
      the most varied aspirations. In the first place, he is concerned with
      preserving his physical existence, for which he undertakes certain
      actions. In the second place, he makes an effort to evaluate the universe
      in himself, and this is a peculiar human tendency, independent of any
      material calculations. In the third place, man also possesses such desires
      as, for example, the love of domination, the love of freedom; men also
      have religious, esthetic, needs, a need for the sympathy of their
      surroundings, etc,&quot; <i>(ibid</i>., pp. 317-320). Having served us
      this chowder of human needs, Khvostov draws the conclusion that a &quot;monistic
      explanation . . . is impossible&quot;. But Khvostov's example, quoted
      above, will serve to indicate the full absurdity of his view (quite
      current among &quot;scholars&quot; all over the world), as well as the
      necessity for a monistic explanation. In fact, is it not a parody of
      scientific thought; to consider the tendency to religion, to domination,
      etc., as eternal categories? Khvostov never even thinks of asking for an
      <i>explanation </i>of them. Religion exists; how shall we explain it?
      Well, by means of man's need of religion. Domination exists; why? Simply
      because: man has a desire for domination. Is this not similar to &quot;explaining&quot;
      sleep as due to a force that &quot;puts to sleep&quot;? Can anything be
      explained in this way? By the use of this method, everything in the world
      can be &quot;explained&quot; without turning an eyelid: the state is
      explained by the desire for the state; art, by the desire for art; the
      circus by the desire for the circus; Khvostov's explanations, by the need
      felt for Khvostov's' explanations; walking, by the desire for walking; and
      so on, <i>ad infinitum</i>. Such a &quot;theory&quot; of the historical
      process is not worth a penny. &quot;The love of liberty is an inherent
      tendency in man.&quot; Nothing could be farther from the truth! Was the &quot;love
      of liberty&quot; an inherent tendency in Nicholas II, during his reign, or
      in his class? Of course not. In spite of Khvostov, this noble impulse is
      not, therefore, present in all men. When we have understood this, we are
      faced with the next question: &quot;Why do certain men have this tendency;
      while others do not?&quot; And then - oh, horror! - we must go back to the
      conditions of their existence, etc. The same applies to all the rest of
      Khvostov's &quot;different needs&quot;. The scholars of the bourgeoisie,
      in kicking against the traces of a monistic interpretation, are in reality
      fighting against any form of explanation at all.</font></p>

    <h4>h. The Formative Principles of Social Life</h4>
    
    <p>We are now prepared to discuss the general question of the possibility
      of distinguishing a definite &quot;characteristic&quot; of each specific &quot;era&quot;.
      Shall we perhaps find that the connection existing between all the social
      phenomena will express itself in the existence of some element common to
      all? We have seen that they are all determined &quot;in the last analysis&quot;
      by the productive forces and the production relations. How may this
      connection be recapitulated in a few words? How shall this problem be
      approached? Let us consider art, one of the &quot;finest&quot;, &quot;most
      complicated&quot; phenomena of mental life. In each epoch, as we have
      seen, art has its own &quot;style&quot;, expressing itself in specific
      forms, indicative of the specific content (let us recall the example of
      the Egyptian art), which - in turn - is indicative of a specific ideology;
      the ideology is the outgrowth of a specific psychology; the psychology of
      a specific economy; the economy of a specific stage of the productive
      forces.</p>
    
    <p>Now, if we observe a certain definiteness of forms in all the fields of
      social life, may we assert that all these fields have their style? We may;
      it is as reasonable to speak of the &quot;style&quot; of science&quot;, as
      of the style of &quot;art&quot;. We may speak of a &quot;style of life&quot;,
      i.e., of typical, specific forms of life. <sup class="anote"><a href="#40" name="40b">40)</a></sup>
      We may in a certain sense speak of the style of the social economy,
      meaning precisely what Marx terms the &quot;production relations&quot;,
      the &quot;mode of production&quot;, the &quot;economic structure of
      society&quot;. As the style of a certain building is determined by the
      specific combination of its elements, so the &quot;style&quot; of social
      economy expresses itself in the peculiarities of the production relations,
      the specific manner in which the elements of the social whole are
      connected with each other. &quot;The peculiar shape and manner in which
      this union is realized distinguishes the various epochs of the social
      structure.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#41" name="41b">41)</a></sup>
      But in addition to the &quot;mode of production&quot;, there is also a &quot;mode
      of conception&quot;, as Marx puts it. Such is the &quot;style&quot; of the
      ideology of the given period in general, i.e., that special combination of
      ideas, thoughts, feelings, forms, characteristic of the specific epoch, &quot;the
      uniformity of scientific thinking, of conceptions of the world and of life&quot;,
      to use the words of Professor Marbe.<sup class="anote"><a href="#42" name="42b">42)</a></sup>
    </p>
    
    <p>Is it possible thus to distinguish the &quot;mode of production&quot;
      and the &quot;mode of conception&quot;? Is it possible to distinguish
      between the economic &quot;style&quot; of a specific society and the
      ideological &quot;style&quot;? From what has been said concerning the
      superstructures in general and the ideologies in particular, it is certain
      that we have the right to do this.</p>
    
    <p>We may show this by means of an example: feudal society; the <i>economic
      </i>style of feudal society is expressed in the principles of a fixed
      hierarchy, the idea of rank. Marx characterizes the feudal epoch as
      follows: &quot;Here, instead of the independent man, we find everyone
      dependent, serfs and lords, vassals and suzerains, laymen and clergy.
      Personal dependence here characterizes the social relations of production
      just as much as it does the other spheres of life organized on the basis
      of that production&quot;:<sup class="anote"><a href="#43" name="43b">43)</a></sup>
      This character of the economy and the other spheres of life is precisely
      the &quot;style&quot; of the epoch, the hierarchical arrangement by rank,
      in economy; the hierarchical dependence in the other spheres of life; the
      hierarchical &quot;style&quot; of the entire ideology. Indeed, the entire
      philosophy of man was then religious, and religion is a philosophy that
      explains everything in a hierarchical manner; <i>according to rank</i>.
      Science is permeated with this idea of rank; so is art; and we find this
      condition expressed in the &quot;style&quot;, In the Middle Ages, rank
      <i>is </i>the &quot;style&quot; of all of life. And the uniformity of
      this style proves the dependence of the &quot;mode of <i>con</i>ception&quot;
      on the &quot;mode of production&quot;, of the system of ideas on the
      system of persons, the latter in turn being conditioned by the system of
      objects, i.e., by the social material productive forces. Such a basic
      stratum of style as is here afforded by hierarchy or rank, may be termed
      the &quot;formative principle <i>of </i>social life&quot;, based, as we
      have seen, on the production relations.</p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">This unity in the style of life is so obvious that even
      many bourgeois scholars come very close to accepting this view. Karl
      Lamprecht, for example, sets up the doctrine of the &quot;dominant of
      personality,&quot; i.e., the prevailing type of psychology, changing with
      the conditions of the epoch, in which the old dominant is destroyed and a
      new one arises, a new &quot;style of life&quot; being created (K.
      Lamprecht: <i>Moderne Geschichts. wissenschaft, </i>Berlin 1920, pp. 77
      et seq.). In the solution of the question of formative principles, we also
      have a fairly simple solution of the question raised by Hammacher. The
      latter mobilizes the following chief objection to the theory of historical
      materialism: &quot;It remains a constant problem why only the economic
      relations could obtain admission into the historical soul&quot; (Emil
      Hammacher: <i>Das philosophisch-okonomische System des Marxismus, </i>Leipzig,
      1909, p.178). This enigma is easily solved. Men are influenced not only by
      economic stimuli, but by everything that lies within the sphere of their
      experience; the general <i>formative </i>principles are determined,
      however, by the production relations, which are therefore &quot;reflected&quot;
      also in the ideological fields. This may be best observed in the case of
      religion. No doubt sunlight, thunder, death, sleep, all found &quot;admission
      to the historical soul.&quot; But the conception of godhood, of a &quot;sublime
      power&quot;, of &quot;rank&quot; in creation, did not arise until rank had
      already been established in social life, Into this frame, all &quot;appropriate&quot;
      phenomena were jammed in, including sleep and death. Approaching the
      subject from another angle: in bloody despotisms, the god of war was
      frequently the chief of all the gods. Being the god of war, he naturally
      also became god of thunder and lightning, which were the most awful &quot;belligerent&quot;
      forces of nature. Thunderstorms made an impression on the &quot;historical
      soul&quot;, but this material was shaped by the frame of the social
      relations. We might ask why the social relations give shape to this
      material; where is the inner relation? The reason is very simple: the
      social environment has the foundations of its life in the production
      relations &quot; &quot;We know that the uniformity of psychical phenomena
      may be traced back to the uniformity in the conditions of these phenomena&quot;
      (Marbe, ibid., p.52). Many facts taken from this field are &quot;to a
      certain extent cultural products; Huber (in <i>Zeitschrift fiir
      Psychologie</i>, vol. 59, 1911, pp.241, <i>et seq.) </i>has shown that in
      experiments in psychological association, the quality of the reaction
      words depends, among other things, on the vocation and the habits of life
      of the persons experimented on&quot; (Marbe, <i>ibid</i>.). In other
      words, different answers will be given to the same question (for instance,
      a request for a certain word), depending on the &quot;habits of life&quot;
      of the persons experimented on. It is, therefore, not surprising to find
      the social psychology and ideology to be dependent on the mode of
      production of material life, and simultaneously on the productive forces.</font></p>

    <h4>i. Types of Economic Structure; Types of Various Societies</h4>
    
    <p>Any investigation of society will encounter certain historical <i>types</i>
      of society. In other words, there is no such thing as society &quot;in
      general&quot;; we are always dealing with society in a specific historical
      raiment; each society wears the uniform of its time. For we know that any
      specific society is an aggregate of human beings in constant
      interrelation with each other, these interrelations being based on the
      labor relations of men, on the system of <i>production relations</i>, if
      these mutual labor relations be visualized at any given moment. But this
      system of production relations is the aggregate of human beings arranged
      in a specific manner, namely, of beings connected not only by a labor
      bond, but by a specific type of such bond. It is therefore evident that
      society exists only on a specific labor basis, and as this specific basis,
      the specific mode of production, gives rise to a specific mode of
      conception (view of life), it follows that it will condition the type of
      society as a whole, and not only in its material productive or economic
      portion. The technology conditions the mode of production; the mode of
      production conditions the view of life; this chain uniting the material,
      human, and mental system creates a certain type of society. As we
      distinguish genera, species, and families in the animal world so we
      distinguish <i>social types</i> in sociology. This has been repeatedly
      emphasized, but we must again point out as our basic thought, that this
      difference between the social &quot;types&quot; may be traced not only in
      the economic field, but also in any other series of social phenomena. The
      type of a society may be inferred from its ideology as well as from its
      economy. Feudal art permits one to draw conclusions as to feudal
      conditions of production; feudal conditions of production enable one to
      make inferences as to feudal art, or religion, or feudal thinking in
      general, etc., etc. The deciphering of certain literary monuments
      excavated by the archaeologists enables us to form a picture of the life
      and manners of races that have disappeared. A reading of Hammurabi's Codex
      makes the economic life of Babylon live in our minds. The Iliad and the
      Odyssey permit us to form a conception of early Greek history, etc.</p>
    
    <p>The historical forms of society, the specific nature of these forms, are
      applicable not only to the economic basis, but also to the aggregate of
      social phenomena, for the economic structure also determines the political
      structure and the ideological structure. One being given, the other is
      also given. To be sure, this does not mean that a type of society must be
      so sharply distinguished from another as to leave no common traits between
      them. &quot;Epochs in the history of society are no more separated from
      each other by hard and fast lines of demarcation, than are geological
      periods.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#44" name="44b">44)</a></sup>
      On the contrary, in actual reality we find that each new social type, each
      new social structure may present very great and decisive remnants of the
      old economic formations. For example, we find in modern capitalist society
      a great number of remnants of earlier economic forms. Thus the entire
      great class of the peasantry, with its economic life, may be considered on
      the whole as a remnant of the feudal ages; the petty artisans likewise,
      etc. &quot;Pure&quot; capitalism implies a bourgeoisie and a proletariat,
      but not a peasantry, not an artisan class, etc. If such &quot;purity&quot;
      cannot be found in the <i>economic </i>structure, it is obvious that
      there will be a certain &quot;mingling of ideas&quot; in the <i>ideological
      </i>field also. Capitalist society may therefore present us with many
      remnants of feudal ideology, for instance, among the landed nobility and
      the peasantry, rural classes that are based on earlier agricultural
      relations, and which still retain certain traditional traits. The
      interweaving of economic forms will be accompanied by an interweaving of
      ideological forms, with the result that there never is an absolutely
      uniform &quot;mode of production&quot;, and of course - still less - a
      uniform &quot;mode of conception&quot; (for, the latter varies even among
      the various classes that may at the given moment be a part of the same
      economic structure). It does not follow, however, that we cannot and
      should not distinguish between the various types of production relations.
      For, in any actually existing society, a certain type of production
      relations is <i>dominant, </i>and there is also therefore a certain
      prevalent &quot;view of life&quot;. Werner Sombart is right when he says: &quot;I
      distinguish a certain epoch in the economic life by the <i>predominance
      </i>of a specific spirit in a specific period.<sup class="anote"><a href="#45" name="45b">45)</a></sup>
      Marx, speaking of capitalism, likewise terms it &quot;the form of society
      in which capitalist production is predominant&quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#46" name="46b">46)</a></sup>
      As we may distinguish between ape and man in the animal kingdom, in spite
      of their many common traits, so we may distinguish also between the
      various forms of society in spite of their common traits; in spite of the
      fact that the &quot;higher&quot; forms frequently present quite useless
      remnants of older forms (so called &quot;rudiments&quot;), which are
      incomprehensible at first sight.</p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">In chapter iii, we have already spoken of the necessity
      of distinguishing, in any treatment of society, the social form which is
      rooted in the peculiarities of the economic structure. This conception has
      been vigorously and repeatedly opposed by official bourgeois science,
      which is hostile to the notion of a radical transformation of social
      relations. Bourgeois scholars themselves now admit that the crux of the
      matter is in the above fact. Thus, Dr. Bernhard Odenbreit writes: &quot;Marx,
      as is only natural in the case of a `revolutionary', has a particularly
      sharp eye for the historical, transitory nature of all social
      institutions. This general social understanding is joined with a
      consciously critical reflection on the narrower field of political economy&quot;
      (Plenge: <i>Staatswissenschaftliche Beiträge, No. 1; B. </i>Odenbreit:
      <i>Die vergleichende Wirtschaftstheorie bei Karl Marx, </i>Essen-on-Ruhr
      1919, p.15). Precisely so! The &quot;sharp eye&quot; for that which is
      changing will be found only in the revolutionary. This is, of course, one
      of the principal reasons for the superiority of the social sciences of the
      revolutionary proletariat over the social sciences of the
      counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie.</font></p>
    
    <p>In so called primitive communism, the oldest form of society known to
      us, the type of production relations in which the economic &quot;personality&quot;
      is not yet isolated from the &quot;horde&quot;, We also find the
      corresponding forms of consciousness: absence of religion, of ideas of
      rank, even of the notion of personality, of the individual <i>per se.
      </i>Similarly, a consideration of so called feudal society shows that its &quot;essential
      traits consist on the one hand in the splitting up of the land into a
      number of independent estates, principalities, and privileged holdings,
      and on the other hand in the organization of these holdings by means of
      contractual vassal relations.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#47" name="47b">47)</a></sup>
      The style of economy is here hierarchic; likewise, the style of politics,
      of the ideology. As we have already seen, the notion of <i>rank </i>is
      everywhere prevalent. The basis is the large landed estate (<i>nulle
      terre sans seigneur, </i>&quot;no land without its master&quot;), inert
      and uneventful. The economic bonds are bonds between feudal landowners and
      serfs; these relations are stable immobile, and - from the point of view
      of the members of feudal society - immutable; everything is &quot;fixed&quot;
      in its place in the hierarchic order. Let the shoemaker stick to his last!
      The same; condition was reflected in the political superstructure that was
      expressive of these production conditions.</p>
    
    <p>&quot;The hierarchic tendency of feudal life was elevated by the learned
      jurists of the Thirteenth Century into a theory and a system &quot;
      <sup class="anote"><a href="#48" name="48b">48)</a></sup> The preachers
      have a clear vision of the horizontal distribution of society as a whole,
      even though it be divided into masters and servants. The latter are
      admonished to follow the words of the apostle commanding slaves to obey
      their masters, since God has installed kings and dukes on earth, and other
      men in order that the latter might obey the former. God so disposed things
      as to enable the weak to depend on the strong.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#49" name="49b">49)</a></sup>
      The entire conception of life is religious, <i>i.e., </i>permeated with
      the notion of rank, or, to use another term, it is authoritarian. Its
      rigidity, its fidelity to tradition, are a natural result. Science
      consists chiefly in interpreting tradition and the Sacred Scriptures; art
      is &quot;divine&quot;, magnifying in its form and content the &quot;higher&quot;
      celestial and terrestrial powers; the dominant morality and the dominant
      manners and morals are those inculcated by feudal fidelity, noble
      arrogance, pious awe of the commandments of ancestors, respect for &quot;gentle
      bearing&quot; and &quot;gentle lineage&quot;. <i>Quod licet Jovi, non
      licet bovi. </i>In other words, we are here dealing with a specific <i>social
      &quot;species&quot;, </i>a specific form of society, <i>beginning with
      </i>its <i>material basis, and rising to the &quot;highest&quot; forms of
      social consciousness.</i></p>
    
    <p>Let us now consider capitalist society, whose economic basis is an
      entirely different type of relations. &quot;The contrast between the
      power, based on the personal relations of dominion and servitude, that is
      conferred by landed property, and the impersonal power that is given by
      money, is well expressed by the two French proverbs, <i>Nulle terre sans
      seigneur, </i>and <i>L'argent n'a pas de maître</i>.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#50" name="50b">50)</a></sup>
      In this sentence, Marx has revealed one of the fundamental relations in
      capitalist society, namely, the connection between the various enterprises
      <i>through the market, </i>whence results also the impersonal power of
      this market and the impersonal, &quot;abstract&quot; power of money. But
      there is another phase also: the impersonal, social power of money turned
      to capital nevertheless finds its master, in so far as a simple
      commodities production is transformed into a capitalistic production. </p>
    
    <p>&quot;Just as every qualitative difference between commodities is
      extinguished in money, so money, on its side, like the radical leveler
      that it is, does away with all distinctions. But money itself is a
      commodity, an external object, capable of becoming the private property of
      any individual. Thus social power becomes the private power of private
      persons.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#51" name="51b">51)</a></sup>
      From this follows another trait in the economy of capitalist society,
      namely, its hierarchic character. This trait has also been brilliantly
      outlined by Marx, particularly in his chapter on cooperation
      <sup class="anote"><a href="#52" name="52b">52)</a></sup>: &quot;The
      control of the capitalist is &quot; in form &quot; despotic. As
      cooperation extends its scale, this despotism takes forms peculiar to
      itself. Just as at first the capitalist is relieved from actual labor so
      soon as his capital has reached that minimum amount with which capitalist
      production, as such, begins, so now he hands over the work of direct and
      constant supervision of individual workmen, and groups all workmen into a
      special kind of wage laborer. An industrial army of workmen, under the
      command of a capitalist, requires, like a real army, officers (managers),
      and sergeants (foremen, overlookers), who, while the work is being done,
      command in the name of the capitalist. The work of supervision becomes
      their established and exclusive function.&quot;</p>
    
    <p>The capitalist mode of production is therefore twofold in character: on
      the one hand, it is the summation of the individual private economies, &quot;enterprises&quot;,
      united by the anarchic bond of the market, through exchange, the blind
      elemental force of the market controlling each individual economy; on the
      other hand, it is a hierarchic system, with &quot;capital in command&quot;.
      Naturally, this mode of production has also produced its corresponding
      view of life. Its &quot;style&quot; must reflect its twofold nature. And
      indeed, &quot;the view of life&quot; of capitalist society is
      characterized on the one hand by what Marx terms the <i>fetishism of
      commodities, </i>and on the other hand by the principle of <i>rank, </i>which
      we have already observed in feudal society. The combination of these two &quot;formative
      principles&quot; results in the fundamental style of the &quot;view of
      life&quot; prevalent in the capitalist world.</p>
    
    <p>We must now define the <i>fetishism of commodities. </i>In a society of
      commodities capitalism, the enterprise works &quot;independently&quot; for
      an unknown market. But each labor here constitutes a section of the social
      labor, all the sections being mutually dependent; but the social relation
      between men, actually at work for each other, is concealed to the eye. If
      we were dealing with a socialist economy in which all things proceed
      according to plan, it would be perfectly clear at first glance that men
      are working for each other, that each individual type of labor is merely a
      section of the general social labor, etc. The relations between men would
      then be clear, the mists dispelled. But the case in the capitalist world
      is quite different. Here the labor relation <i>between men </i>is
      invisible, being concealed by the manipulations of the market, where
      commodities are shifted, sold and bought. The market is not rationally
      controlled by men, but, through its prices, controls men. Men observe the
      <i>movements </i>of <i>commodities </i>without understanding that they
      are working for each other, all men being related by the common labor
      bond. The latter appears to them as a specific miraculous power of
      commodities, as a &quot;value&quot; of these commodities. Relations
      between men present themselves as relations between commodities. That is
      what we mean by the <i>fetishism of commodities, </i>the ascribing to
      commodities of qualities truly inherent in human labor. This fetishism,
      which causes &quot;a definite social relation between men . . . to assume
      in their eyes the fantastic form of a relation between things&quot;,<sup class="anote"><a href="#53" name="53b">53)</a></sup>
      constitutes the peculiar earmark of the capitalist &quot;view of life&quot;.
      We have already observed that bourgeois scholars, artists, philosophers,
      etc., are irritated by discussions concerning the social roots of science,
      art, or philosophy. They are out and out fetishists, for they disregard
      the social connections, being unable to conceive of their inspired, divine
      labor as merely a portion of the total <i>social labor</i>.</p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">The fetishism of the capitalist world is very
      graphically indicated in the field of the so called moral standards, of &quot;ethics,&quot;
      a favorite topic with the learned professors. We have already ascertained
      that the ethical norms are the rules of conduct for the preservation of
      the society, or of the class, or of the vocational group, etc. They have a
      necessary, social, service significance. Yet, in fetishistic society, this
      human and social significance of standards is not recognized. On the
      contrary, these standards, i.e., the technical rules of conduct, appear as
      a &quot;duty&quot;, dwelling far above men, like any other external divine
      compulsion. This inevitable fetishism of ethics is excellently expressed
      by the bourgeois <i>philosophic genius, </i>Immanuel Kant, in his
      doctrine of the &quot;categorical imperative&quot;.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="-1">The proletariat must approach the question from a
      different angle. The proletariat must not preach a capitalistic fetishism.
      For the proletariat, the standards of its conduct are technical rules in
      precisely the sense of the rules according to which a joiner constructs an
      arm chair. The latter, wishing to construct an armchair, will plane, saw,
      glue, etc., which acts are involved in the labor process itself. He will
      not interpret the rules of woodworking as something foreign to him, of
      supernatural origin, whose victim he is. The attitude of the proletariat
      in its social struggle is precisely the same. If it would attain
      communism, it must do this and that, as the joiner at work on his
      armchair. And everything required, from this point of view, must be done.
      &quot;Ethics&quot; will ultimately, in the case of the proletariat, be
      transformed into simple and easily understood technical rules of conduct,
      such as are required for communism, and thus it will really cease to be
      ethics <i>at all. </i>For the essence of ethics is in the fact that it
      involves norms enveloped in a fetishistic raiment. Fetishism is the
      essence of ethics; where fetishism disappears, ethics also will disappear.
      For instance, no one would think of designating the constitution of a
      consumer's store or of a party as &quot;ethical&quot; or &quot;moral&quot;,
      for anyone can see the human significance of these things. Ethics, on the
      other hand, presupposes a fetishistic mist, which turns the heads of many
      persons. The proletariat needs rules of conduct, and it needs to have them
      very clear, but it has no need of &quot;ethics&quot;, i.e., a fetishistic
      sauce to flavor the meal. Of course, it is obvious that the proletariat
      will not at once succeed in liberating itself from the fetishism of the
      commodities society in which it lives; but that is another question.</font></p>
    
    <p>The fetishism of the ideology of capitalism and commodities is merged
      with the principle of &quot;rank&quot;, and these two fundamental
      formative principles constitute the nucleus of the capitalist mode of
      thought, the framework for the ideological material. Capitalist society is
      thus a special type of society, with special characteristic traits in all
      the &quot;levels&quot; of social life, up to the highest ideological
      superstructure. <i>The type of economic structure, </i>therefore, also
      determines the type of the social-political structure and of the
      ideological structure. Society has a basic &quot;style&quot; in all the
      dominant phenomena of its life.</p>
    
    <p><a name="j"></a></p>
    
    <h4>j. The Contradictory Character of Evolution; External and Internal
    Equilibrium of Society</h4>
    
    <p>We have examined above the phenomena of social equilibrium; but we must
      not lose sight of the fact that we are dealing with a mobile equilibrium,
      <i>i.e., </i>a situation in which equilibrium is being constantly
      disturbed, then reestablished on an altered basis, then again disturbed.
      We are dealing, in other words, with a process of contradictions, not of
      rest; we are not discussing a condition of absolute adjustment, but a
      struggle between opposites, a dialectic process of motion. In considering
      the structure of society, <i>ie</i>. the mutual relation between its
      parts, we may not conceive of this relation as a perfect harmony between
      these parts. Every structure involves internal contradictions; in every
      social class form, these contradictions are very sharp. Bourgeois
      sociologists, while recognizing the mutual relation of the various social
      phenomena, do not understand the internal oppositions of the social forms.
      In this respect, the entire school founded by the originator of bourgeois
      sociology, Auguste Comte, is very interesting. Comte recognizes the
      relation between all the social phenomena (the so called &quot;consensus&quot;)
      in which its &quot;order&quot; is expressed. But the contradictions within
      this &quot;order&quot;, particularly such as lead to its inevitable
      destruction, do not receive his attention. On the other hand, for the
      advocates of dialectic materialism, this phase is one of the most
      essential, perhaps <i>the </i>most essential phase. For, as we have seen,
      the contradictions in any given system are precisely the &quot;moving&quot;
      element, leading to an alteration of forms, to a characteristic
      transformation of species in the process of social evolution or social
      decline.</p>
    
    <p>In our consideration of the social structure, we have seen that its
      alterations are closely connected with the alterations in the relation
      between society and nature. The latter equilibrium we have designated as
      an <i>external </i>equilibrium, while the equilibrium between the various
      series of social phenomena has been called the <i>internal </i>equilibrium
      of society. If we now regard all of society from the point of view of a
      contradictory evolution, we are at once faced with a number of questions:
      in the first place, we shall find the existence of contradictions within
      each series of social phenomena (for example, in economy, the
      contradictions between the various labor functions; in the
      social-political structure, the contradictions between classes; in
      ideology, contradictions between the ideological systems of the classes,
      etc., not to mention many other contradictions); we shall find also,
      without difficulty, the contradictions between economy and politics (for
      instance, when legal standards have been outdistanced by the economic
      evolution, and a &quot;reform&quot; becomes mature); between economy and
      ideology; and between psychology and ideology (for instance, the need of
      something new is felt, but the new has not yet been expressed in
      ideological form); between science and philosophy, etc. These are
      contradictions <i>between the series of the various social phenomena.</i></p>
    
    <p>Both elements are a necessary part of the internal equilibrium; but
      there is a contradiction between society and nature, <i>a </i>disturbance
      of equilibrium between society and its environment, which finds its
      expression in the movement of the productive forces. This is the field of
      external equilibrium. Of course, there is another extremely important case
      of contradiction, namely, that <i>between the movement of the productive
      forces and the social-economic structure of society </i>(and all the rest
      of the social structure).</p>
    
    <p>In this case, the relation obtaining between society and nature comes in
      conflict with the relations developed within society. Obviously, this
      conflict, this contradiction, must play a very important role in the life
      of society, for it concerns the bases of the existing &quot;order&quot;,
      the &quot;pillars&quot; on which the given order rests.</p>
    
    <p>We have here sketched only the principal questions involved in the
      social contradictions, the investigation of which is to be the subject of
      the next chapter, which will deal with society in motion. Thus far, we
      have considered chiefly the <i>structure of society, of </i>the given
      social form. We shall now undertake a treatment of the transitions from
      one structure to another. Again we emphasize that the law of social
      equilibrium is a law of mobile equilibrium, that includes antagonisms,
      contradictions, incompatibilities, conflicts, struggles, and - this is
      particularly important - that it cannot dispense, under certain
      circumstances, with catastrophes and revolutions, which are absolutely
      inevitable. Our Marxian theory is the revolutionary theory.</p>
