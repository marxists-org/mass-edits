    <H3>8: The Classes and the Class</H3>
    
    <H4><a name="a"></a>a. Class, Caste, Vocation</H4>
    
    <P>WE have already seen the important function of the classes in the
      evolution of human society. Even the social structure in a class society
      depends chiefly on what classes exist in this society what is their mutual
      relation, etc. And we have seen that every great alteration in the social
      life is connected with a class struggle in one way or another. It is not
      unimportant to note that transition from one form of society to another is
      realized through a furious class struggle. This is why Marx and Engels
      opened the <I>Communist Manifesto </I>with the words: &quot;The history
      of society existing up to the present is the history of class struggles. &quot;
      We have already defined the general nature of a <I>class. </I>We now
      prepared to go into further detail.</P>
    
    <P>A social class - we have seen - is the aggregate of persons playing the
      same part in production, standing in the same relation toward other
      persons in the production process, these relations being also expressed in
      things (instruments of labor). It follows that in the process of
      distribution the common element of each class is its uniform source of
      income, for the conditions in the distribution of products are determined
      by the conditions in production. Textile workers and metal workers are not
      two separate classes; but a single class, since they bear the same
      relation to certain other <I>persons</I> (engineers, capitalists).
      Similarly, the proprietors of a mine, a brick-field, a corset-factory, are
      all of one class; for regardless of the physical differences between the
      things they manufacture, they occupy a common (&quot;commanding&quot;)
      position with regard to the persons engaged in the process of production,
      which position is also expressed in things (&quot;capital&quot;).</P>
    
    <P><I>The production relations </I>are therefore at the basis of the class
      alignment in society. Other divisions have been made, which must now be
      disposed of. A frequent conception is the division into the classes of &quot;poor&quot;
      and &quot;rich&quot;. A man having twice as much money in his pocket as
      another is considered as belonging to a different class, the basis of the
      division being in this case the amount possessed of the standard of
      living. An English sociologist (D'Ett) has gone so far as to draw a table
      of classes: the first and lowest class (paupers) have a budget of eighteen
      shillings per week; the second class, twenty-five shillings; the third,
      forty-five shillings, etc.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P>This conception is not only very simple, but also naive and erroneous.
      From this point of view, a well paid metal worker in capitalist society
      would not be counted with the proletariat, while a poor person or artisan
      would fall into the working class. The lumpenproletariat would have to be
      considered as the most revolutionary class, as the power capable of
      realizing the transition to a higher form of society. On the other hand,
      two bankers, one of whom has twice as much money as the other, would have
      to be assigned to two separate classes. Yet, everyday experience shows us
      that the various classes of workers are far more likely to fight side by
      side than are the workers and artisans, or workers and peasants, etc. The
      peasant is not much inclined to feel any solidarity with the worker. At
      the other end of the scale, two bankers feel themselves to be members of
      the same family, though one be ten times as rich as the other. Marx
      already pointed out that the size of one's purse constitutes a merely
      quantitative difference, which may, to be sure, throw two individuals of
      the same class into violent opposition to each other. In other wards, the
      difference in &quot;wealth&quot; may not be considered as sufficient basis
      for the definition of a class, even though it have an influence within the
      frame of one class.</P>
    
    <P>Another widely accepted theory is that which makes the process of
      distribution the basis of the class division o£ society, <I>i.e</I>.,
      the distribution of social <I>income. </I>Thus, in capitalist society,
      the division of income into three principal groups, profits, ground rent,
      wages, gives rise to a distinction between three classes: capitalists,
      landlords, proletarians (wage workers). The share falling to each of these
      classes may only grow - for a given quantity of social income - at the
      cost of the share falling to another class. The members of one class are
      therefore united not only by common and uniform interests, but also by the
      opposition of their interests to those of other classes.</P>
    
    <P>Unless we debase this theory to a mere consideration of who is getting
      more and who less, we at once encounter the following question: why are
      the persons who are united in a class reproduced as a class? How comes it
      that - let us say - in capitalist society certain types of income exist?
      What is the cause for the stability of these &quot;types of income&quot;?
      The mere putting of these questions shows the true statement of affairs.
      This stability depends on the relation to the <I>means of production,
      </I>which, in turn, <I>express the relation between men in the process of
      production. </I>The function of men in production, and the ownership in
      the interests of production, <I>i.e., </I>the &quot;distribution of
      persons&quot; and the &quot;distribution of means of production&quot; are
      fixed quantities within the limits of the:existing mode of production. If
      we are dealing with capitalism, we have therefore a category of men who
      command the production process, who simultaneously control all sorts of
      means of production, and there is also a category of men working at the
      command of the former, subordinating their labor power to them, and
      producing commodity values. This circumstance is responsible for the fact
      that a certain natural law process prevails in the distribution of the
      products of labor (<I>i.e., </I>in the distribution of income). We have
      therefore come to the point of considering the most important phases in
      production - the &quot;distribution of persons&quot; and the &quot;distribution
      of things&quot; - as the basis of class relations.</P>
    
    <P>Nor could it be otherwise, as we may learn if we approach question in
      the most abstract terms. Every class is obviously a certain &quot;real
      aggregate&quot;, <I>i.e., </I>it sums up all the persons related in
      uninterrupted mutual reactions, all the &quot;living persons&quot; whose
      roots are in production, and whose thoughts may reach into the skies. Each
      class is a special, definite human system within the great system known as
      human society. Our approach to the class must be similar, therefore, to
      our approach to society; in other words, the analysis of classes must
      begin with production. We must of course not be surprised to find classes
      differing from each other along various lines: in production as well as in
      distribution, in politics, in psychology, in ideology. For all these
      things are interdependent; you cannot crown a proletarian tree with
      bourgeois twigs; this would be worse than placing a saddle on a cow. But
      this connection is determined, in the last analysis, by the position of
      the classes in the process of production. Therefore, we must define the
      classes according to a <I>production criterion</I>.</P>
    
    <P>What is the difference between a social <I>class</I> and a social <I>caste</I>?
      A class, as we have seen, is a category of persons united by a common role
      in the production process, a totality in which each member has about the
      same relative position with regard to the other functions in the
      production process. A social caste, on the other hand, is a group of
      persons united by their common position in the juristic or legal order of
      society. Landlords are a class; the nobility are a caste; the great
      landlords are defined by a common production type, not so the nobility.
      The noble has certain legal rights and privileges, due to his &quot;noble
      station&quot;. Yet, economically speaking, this noble may be impoverished;
      he may barely vegetate; he may be a slum-dweller; but his station remains
      that of a noble; such is the Baron in Gorki's <I>Lower Depths. </I>Similarly,
      under the Tsarist government, workers' passports often contained the
      words: &quot;Peasant from such and such a province, such and such a
      district, such and such a parish&quot;, although this worker had never
      been a peasant, had been born in a city and worked for wages since
      childhood. Such is the difference between <I>class </I>and <I>caste.
      </I>A person whose class character is that of a worker may (from the
      standpoint of Tsarist laws) be classified as a peasant. But have we any
      right to dwell on laws without descending deeper, since we know that
      politics (including law) is &quot;the concentrated expression <I>of </I>economy&quot;?</P>
    
    <P>Of course, we must go deeper; we have ourselves pointed out that it is
      methodologically very important to approach the social alignments chiefly
      from the production angle. We find the question of <I>caste </I>excellently
      presented by Professor Solntsev, who has written the authoritative work on
      classes: &quot;Socially unequal groups in the various stations appear as
      such and do not arise on the basis of the relations of the social labor
      process, of economic relations, but chiefly on the basis of legal and
      state relations. The caste is a <I>legal-political </I>category, which
      may express itself in various forms . . . . As distinguished from <I>caste,
      </I>the class alignment arose on the basis of economic conditions&quot;
      (p.22). Solntsev denies that <I>caste is </I>synonymous with class, or
      that it is merely a legal-political raiment for class, while he admits
      that in ancient times, for instance, &quot;the division into estates
      necessarily reflected certain class differences&quot; (p.25), that &quot;the
      class struggle assumes the peculiar form of a struggle between stations
      (estates)&quot; (p.26). This somewhat vague statement obliges us to seek a
      somewhat clearer formulation. In the French Revolution the <I>tiers état</I>
      was a mixture of various classes, then but slightly differentiated from
      each other: it included the bourgeoisie, the workers and the &quot;intermediate
      classes&quot; (artisans, petty traders, etc.). All were members of the
      <I>tiers état</I> for the reason of their legal insignificance as
      compared with the privileged feudal landlords. This <I>tiers état</I>
      was the juristic expression for the class bloc opposing the dominant
      landlords. It follows that class and caste may not be taken as synonymous,
      while the shell of the caste may include on the whole a class <I>kernel
      </I>(a single estate corresponding to a number of class which remain
      classes, in spite of the vagueness in Solntsev's mind). On the other
      hand, class and caste may fail to correspond in another way, as already
      shown: one might belong to a &quot;lower class&quot; but &quot;higher
      caste&quot; (an impoverished nobleman may become a janitor or stoker), or
      the reverse: one may belong to a lower caste and higher class (a peasant
      may become a wealthy merchant) Evidently the &quot;class content under the
      economic envelope&quot; is here non-existent.</P>
    
    <P>A correct theoretical statement of the case may not be obtained by a
      consideration of individual instances, but only from the point of view of
      typical mutual reactions within the frame of a specific economic order.
      The following fundamental circumstance is worthy of attention: the &quot;estates&quot;
      are abolished by the bourgeois revolutions, by the evolution of bourgeois
      conditions. Capitalism was incompatible with the existence of &quot;estates&quot;,
      for the following reason: in pre-capitalist forms of society, all
      relations are far more conservative; the tempo of life is slower;
      alterations are less significant than under capitalism. The dominant class
      is the landed aristocracy, almost a hereditary class. This striking <I>immobility</I>
      in conditions made possible a consolidation of class privileges - as well
      as class duties - by means of a series of legal standards; this immobility
      enabled classes to be enveloped in the garment of the'. &quot;estate&quot;.
      On the whole, therefore, the &quot;estates&quot; followed the same line as
      the classes or groups of classes, in their opposition to a certain class.
      But this harmony was brusquely disturbed by the entrance of the far more
      mobile conditions of commodities capitalism; the insignificant man became
      important; the <I>nouveaux.. riches </I>arose, a very frequent phenomenon
      (some of the great landlords assumed capitalist forms, others becoming
      impoverished,: while still others maintained themselves on the previous
      level, etc.)., Thus the mobility of capitalist relations completely
      undermines the existence of the &quot;estates&quot;. The transition period
      of the disintegration of feudal relations is also expressed in the growing
      disharmony between the economic content of the classes and the legal
      envelope of the &quot;estates&quot;. There now ensued the conflict that
      led inevitably to the collapse of the entire system of &quot;estates&quot;.
      Its &quot;caste&quot; form was incompatible with the growth of capitalist
      production relations, as the class envelope of the production process is
      now becoming incompatible with the further growth of the productive
      forces. Thus, Marx wrote in his <I>Poverty of Philosophy: </I>&quot;The
      condition for the liberation of the working class is the abolition of all
      classes, as the significance of the liberation of the <I>tiers état
      </I>. . . was the abolition of all the <I>estates&quot;. </I>Engels,
      elucidating this passage, adds the following: &quot;Estates here mean the
      estates of the feudal state in the historical sense, estates with
      definite, limited privileges. The revolution of the bourgeoisie abolished
      the estates and their privileges. The bourgeois society now recognizes
      only classes. To term the proletariat the <I>fourth estate </I>was
      therefore to contradict history.'</P>
    
    <P>Therefore: in the period of the stable precapitalist systems, the
      estates were the legal expression of the classes; the increasing
      incompatibility of these quantities (the disturbance of equilibrium
      between the class content and the legal form of the estates) was called
      forth by the growth of capitalist relations and the disintegration of not
      only the higher but also the lower of the old feudal classes. Under the
      feudal system, the peasantry as a class coincided in general with the
      peasantry as an estate; but the country bourgeoisie and the city
      proletariat began to differentiate from the peasantry, retaining, however,
      the garment of their former &quot;estate&quot; (caste), which, being ill
      adapted to the new conditions, have had to be discarded.</P>
    
    <P>We must now examine the third category mentioned at the beginning of
      this chapter. Manifestly, <I>vocation </I>is connected with the process
      of production. At first glance, the difference between a vocation and
      class is based on the fact that the line between vocations is not drawn as
      a line in the relations between men, but as a line in their relations with
      <I>things, </I>depending on what <I>things, </I>with what <I>things
      </I>one works, what <I>things </I>are produced. The difference between
      metal turner and joiner and mason is not based on a different relation to
      capitalists, but simply on the fact that one works metals, the other wood,
      the third stone.</P>
    
    <P>Yet the essence o£ the matter is not in the <I>thing, </I>for
      vocation is simultaneously a social relation; in the process of
      production, which unites many workers of different types, owing to the
      standards of the production process, a definite relation naturally
      prevails. However different these relations may be, they are all
      subsidiary to the differences that prevail in the principal phase: <I>the
      differences between the work of those who command and those obey, the
      differences expressed in the property relations.</I></P>
    
    <P>The classification by vocation, as a relation between person as a
      relation based on the relation toward technical tools, methods, objects of
      labor, coincides neither with the division of labor into commanding and
      obeying elements, nor with the corresponding distribution of instruments
      of production, <I>i.e., </I>with the proper relations in these
      instruments of production.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Professor Solntsev is therefore wrong in declaring that
      vocation &quot;is a <I>natural technical </I>category (Solntsev's
      italics, N. B.), that it is peculiar to human communities even in the
      prehistoric period, as w&lt; as in the following stages that it is not an
      historical category coy nected with the social order&quot; (<I>ibid</I>.,
      p.21), in short, that it is a eternal category. Vocations become vocations
      for the reason that certain kind of labor is usually performed throughout
      the individual's life: let the shoemaker stick to his last! But this does
      not signify that things have always been thus and must always remain thus.
      The increasingly automatic nature of technology will liberate men
      from this necessity and will show to what extent this category also been
      historical rather than permanent.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>We are now prepared to take up a description of the important <I>classes.</I></P>
    
    <P>1.<I> The basic classes of a given social form </I>(classes in the
      proper sense of the word) are two in number: on the one hand, the <I>class
      </I>which commands, monopolizing the instruments of production; <I>on'
      </I>the other hand, the executing class, with no means of production,
      which works for the former. The specific form of this relation of economic
      exploitation and servitude determines the form of the, given class
      society. For example: if the relation between the commanding and executing
      class is reproduced by the purchase of labor power in the market, we have
      capitalism. If it is reproduced. by the purchase of persons, by plunder,
      or otherwise, but not by the purchase of labor power alone, and if the
      commanding class gains control of not only the labor power but also of
      body and soul of the exploited persons, we have a slaveholding system, etc</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In connection with capitalism, three classes are
      usually counted, as confirmed by Marx in the well-known passage at the end
      of volume iii of <I>Capital, </I>where the manuscript suddenly breaks off
      at the beginning of an analysis of the classes in capitalist society. &quot;The
      owners of mere labor power, the owners of capital, and the landlords,
      whose respective sources of income are wages, profit and ground-rent, in
      other words, wage laborers, capitalists and landlords, form the three
      great classes of modern society resting on the capitalist mode of
      production.&quot; <I>(Capital, </I>Chicago, 1909, vol. iii, p.1,031) But
      the circumstance that the land-owning group constitutes a <I>great </I>&quot;class&quot;
      does not imply that it is one of the essential classes. Thus, we find the
      following passage in Marx, which Professor Solntsev erroneously quotes in
      his own support: &quot;Objectified and living labor are the two factors on
      the contrast between which capitalist production is based. Capitalist and
      wage laborer are the sole functionaries and factors in production, their
      relation and opposition being a result of the very essence of the
      capitalist mode of production . . . . Production, as observed by James
      Mill, might therefore continue uninterrupted, if the landlord should
      disappear and be replaced by the state. . . This reduction in the number
      of classes directly concerned in production, to capitalists and wage
      laborers, <I>eliminating the landlord, </I>who only subsequently enters
      into the relation, as a consequence not of property relations produced
      within the limits of the capitalist mode of production, but of property
      relations <I>handed down </I>to capitalism - a reduction inherent in the
      nature of the capitalist mode of production, distinguishing it from feudal
      and ancient production - makes it an adequate theoretical expression of
      the capitalist mode of production and manifests its <I>differentia
      specifica.&quot; </I>(Marx: <I>Theorien über den Mehrwert, </I>Stuttgart,
      1915, vol. ii, part i, pp.292 <I>et seq</I>.). Marx again makes the same
      statement in his treatment of nationalization of the soil.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The basic classes may be subdivided into their various elements. In
      capitalist society, the commanding bourgeoisie was partly industrial,
      partly commercial, partly banking, ere. The working class includes skilled
      and unskilled workers.</P>
    
    <P>2. <I>Intermediate classes: </I>these include such social-economic
      groups as constitute a necessity for the society in which they live, <I>without
      being </I>a remnant of the old order. They occupy a middle position
      between the commanding and exploiting classes. Such are, for instance, the
      technical mental workers in capitalist society.</P>
    
    <P>3.<I> Transition classes: </I>these include such groups as have emerged
      from the preceding form of society, and as are now disintegrating in their
      present form, giving rise to various classes with opposite roles in
      production. Such are, for example, the artisans and peasants in capitalist
      society, who constitute a heritage from the feudal system, and from whom
      both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are recruited.</P>
    
    <P>Thus, the peasantry is constantly falling to pieces under capitalism;
      economically speaking, it is differentiated; the rich peasant grows out of
      the medium peasantry, becoming a trader and, one step further up, a true
      bourgeois. On the other hand, the proletariat is also growing out of the
      peasantry, by some such process as this: the peasant has no horse; he
      becomes a farm laborer or seasonal worker; he becomes a true proletarian.</P>
    
    <P>4.<I> Mixed class types: </I>these include such groups as belong to of
      class in one respect and to another class in another respect, for example,
      the railroad worker who runs a farm of his own, for which he hires a
      laborer; he is a worker from the standpoint of the railroad company, but
      an &quot;employer&quot; from the standpoint of the hired man.</P>
    
    <P>5. Finally there are the so call declassé groups, <I>i.e.; </I>of
      persons outside the outlines of social labor: the <I>lumpenproletariat,
      </I>beggars, vagrants, etc.</P>
    
    <P>In an analysis of the &quot;abstract type&quot; of society, <I>i.e.,
      </I>any form in its purest state, we are dealing almost exclusively with
      its basic classes; but when we take up the concrete reality, we of course
      find ourselves faced with the motley picture with all social-economic
      types and relations.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The general cause of the existence of classes is
      defined by Engels in his <I>Anti-Dühring </I>as follows &quot;&quot;
      that all previous historical contradictions between exploiting and
      exploited, ruling and oppressed classes are explained by the same
      comparatively undeveloped productivity of human labor. As long, as the
      truly working population is so completely occupied by its necessary labor
      as to leave it no time' for conducting the common affairs of society -
      division of labor, business of the state, legal matters, art, science,
      etc.- so long did we necessarily have a special class which, freed from
      actual labor, looked after these matters; in which connection, it never
      failed to place more and more work upon the shoulders of the working
      masses, for its own advantage&quot; ( Friedrich Engels: <I>Herrn Eugen Dührings
      Unwälzung der Wissenschaft, </I>Stuttgart, 1901, pp.190, 191). In
      another passage (p.190), practically the same remark is repeated, with the
      added statement that society is divided into two classes. A recapitulation
      of the whole matter is this: &quot;The law of the division of labor is
      therefore <I>the basic factor in the division into classes</I>.&quot;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Professor Solntsev criticizes G. Schmoller, who finds
      the cause of the formation of the classes to be chiefly the division of
      labor, and attacks Schmoller's reference to Engels with the following
      words: &quot;Engels actually shows the close connection between the
      process of class formation and the process of the division of labor; but &quot;
      Engels regards the division of labor as only the necessary
      natural-technical condition for the formation of social classes, not as
      their cause; the causal basis of the formation of classes was found by
      Engels, <I>not </I>in the division of labor, <I>but </I>in the relation
      between production and distribution, <I>i.e., </I>in processes of purely
      economic nature&quot; (<I>ibid., </I>p.303, my italics, <I>N. B</I>.).
      As we have observed above, when considering the question of vocation, we
      may not oppose the division of labor to the production relations, for the
      division of labor is likewise one of the varieties of the production
      relations. Schmoller's error (in his books, <I>Die Tatsachen der
      Arbeitsteilung, </I>Jahrbücher, 1889; <I>Das Wesen der
      Arbeitsteilung und Klassenbildung</I>, Jahrbücher, 1890) is in
      overlooking the difference between the stratification of vocations and the
      stratification of classes, thus reconciling class oppositions in the
      spirit of the organic school. The theory of L. Gumplowicz and F.
      Oppenheimer, which traces the origin of classes from extra-economic force,
      overlooks the difference between the abstract theory of society and the
      concrete facts of history. In actual history, the role of the
      extra-economic use of force (conquest) was very great, and had an
      influence on the process of class formation. But in a purely theoretical
      investigation, this condition may not be considered. Assuming that we are
      analyzing society <I>only</I>, &quot;abstract society&quot;, in its
      evolution, we should find classes developing here also, by reason of the
      so called &quot;internal&quot; causes of development mentioned by Engels.
      Therefore, the role of conquests, etc., is merely a (very important) <I>complicating
      </I>factor.</FONT></P>
    
    <H4><a name="b"></a>b. Class Interest</H4>
    
    <P>We have seen that classes are specific groups of persons, &quot;real
      aggregates&quot;, distinguished by their role in production, which role 1s
      expressed in the <I>property relations. </I>But these two phases in the
      production process also are accompanied by a third phase-the process of
      the distribution of products in one way or another. Production is
      paralleled by distribution.</P>
    
    <P>The forms of distribution correspond to the forms of production. The
      position of the classes in production determines their position in
      distribution. The antagonism between administrators and the administrated,
      between the class monopolizing the instruments of production and the class
      possessing no means of production, is expressed in an antagonism in
      income, in a contradiction between the shares held by each class in the
      product turned out. This different &quot;being&quot; of the classes also
      determines their &quot;consciousness&quot;. The contradictions of the &quot;being&quot;,
      of the conditions of existence, are directly reflected in the growth of
      <I>class interests. </I>The most primitive and general expression of
      class interest is the <I>effort of the classes to increase their share in
      the distribution of the total mass of products</I>.</P>
    
    <P>In the system of class society, the process of production is at the same
      time a process of the economic exploitation of those who work physically.</P>
    
    <P>They produce more than they receive, not only because a portion of the
      product turned out (of <I>values, </I>in capitalist society) goes for
      extending production (&quot;accumulation&quot;, in capitalist society),
      but also because the working class is supporting the owners of the
      instruments of production, is working for them. The most general interest
      of the dominant minority may therefore be formulated as the effort <I>to
      maintain and extend the opportunities for economic exploitation; </I>while
      the interest of the exploited majority is <I>to liberate itself from this
      exploitation. </I>The first of these two efforts has an eye only to
      society as it exists at present; the second is challenge to the existence
      of this society.</P>
    
    <P>But the economic structure of society - as we have seen - is fortified
      in its state organization and supported by countless superstructural
      forms. It is therefore not surprising to find the economic class interest
      clothed also in the garment of political, religious, scientific interests,
      etc. The class interests thus develop into an entire system, <I>embracing
      the most varied domains of social life</I>. These coordinated interests,
      maintained in place by the general interest of the class, condition the
      construction of the so called &quot;social ideal&quot;, which is always
      the quintessence of the class interests.</P>
    
    <P>A few additional points require our attention in a discussion of class
      interests</P>
    
    <P>First: <I>permanent, general interests must be distinguished from
      temporary, momentary interests. </I>The &quot;momentary&quot; interests
      may even constitute an objective contradiction to the permanent interests.
      The English workers, for instance, were acting in accordance with their
      temporary interests when they accepted a class harmony with the English
      bourgeoisie, supporting them in the imperialist war; they acted in the
      interest of their wages, which were increased at the expense of the
      colonial workers. But because they thus destroyed the solidarity of <I>all
      </I>the workers, and made a compact with their employers, they were
      opposing the general and permanent interests of their class.</P>
    
    <P><I>Second: </I>the professional <I>interests of a group </I>must not
      be confused with the general <I>interests of the class. </I>Thus, the
      dominant bourgeoisie may, in capitalist society, win over the aristocracy
      of labor (skilled labor), whose special interests then do not coincide
      with those of the entire working class; they are group interests, not
      class interests. Another example: during any war, the commercial
      bourgeoisie violates the commercial laws with all its might, although the
      bourgeois state itself established these laws, and is waging war in the
      interest of the bourgeoisie as a <I>class</I>. In other words, the group
      interests of the commercial section of the bourgeoisie is in this case at
      variance with the interests of the bourgeoisie as a <I>class</I>.</P>
    
    <P><I>Third</I>: alterations in <I>principle and tendency</I> in the
      momentary interests of the class, proceeding simultaneously with the
      alterations in principle of its social situation, must not be left out of
      account. The example of the proletariat will serve to illustrate this
      point. In capitalist society, its most permanent and general interest is
      the destruction of the capitalist system. Its partial demands always have
      this general tendency: the conquest of strategic positions, the
      undermining of bourgeois society, the improving of the proletariat's
      material position, enhance its social strength, preparing its forces for
      the attack on the entire capitalist order. Now, let us assume that the
      proletariat has discharged its historical. task. It has destroyed the old
      state machinery, built up a new machinery, produced a new social
      equilibrium; temporarily, the proletariat assumes the place of the
      commanding class. Obviously, the <I>direction </I>of its interests has
      radically changed: all its partial interests, taken from the point of view
      of the general interests, are now subordinate to the idea of <I>fortifying
      and developing </I>the new conditions, organizing them, offering
      resistance to every attempt at destruction. This dialectic transformation
      is an outgrowth of the dialectic evolution of the proletariat itself,
      onice it has become a state power.</P>
    
    <P>The common element behind both these opposed directions of interest is
      the construction of a new form of society, whose bearer is the
      proletariat, a construction which presupposes the destruction of the old
      envelope, which had become an obstacle to the evolution of the productive
      forces.</P>
    
    <P>A new class, to be capable not only of destroying the old system of
      social relations, but of building up a new one, must necessarily turn its
      interests in the direction of <I>production, i.e., </I>it must not
      approach social questions from the standpoint of division and mere
      distribution, but from that of a destruction of old forms for the purpose
      of a <I>construction </I>of forms with more perfect <I>production, </I>with
      more powerful <I>productive forces.</I></P>
    
    <H4><a name="c"></a>c. Class Psychology and Class Ideology</H4>
    
    <P>The difference in the material conditions of existence that lie at the
      basis of the class stratification of society impresses its mark on the
      entire consciousness of the classes, i.e., on the class psychology and
      ideology. We already know that the psychology of a class is not always
      identical with the material interests of that class (for instance, the
      psychology of despair, escape from the world, longing for death); but it
      always results from the life conditions of this class, being <I>constantly
      </I>determined by the latter. Let. us consider a few examples of the
      manner in which the class psychology and the class ideology are actually
      conditioned by the economic condition of the class.</P>
    
    <P>Our first example will be taken from the Russian Revolution. It is a
      matter of common knowledge that Russian Marxists and
      Social-Revolutionaries disagreed as to which class would lead society to
      socialism. The Marxists maintained it would be the working class, the
      proletariat; the Social Revolutionaries, on the other hand, claimed that
      the peasantry would take the lead in this field. The facts of life have
      supported the Marxists; the peasantry supported the proletarians in their
      struggle against the landlords and capitalists, because the proletariat
      guards the peasants' ownership of the soil and makes possible the
      development of peasant economy; yet the peasants are but little
      susceptible to communism and adhere to the old forms of tilling the soil,
      and of agriculture in general. It will be interesting to determine the
      reasons for this phenomenon, the heroic struggle of the proletariat and
      its incomparably, greater receptivity for communist reconstruction and
      communist ideology. It is not sufficient to reply that the peasants are
      not quite so poor, for then we might ask why the <I>lumpenproletariat
      </I>(beggars, declassed persons) did not furnish the chief detachments of
      fighters.</P>
    
    <P>It is important to learn what are the traits that must be preset in a
      class in order to enable it to accomplish a transformation of society, to
      shunt society from the capitalist track to the socialist track.</P>
    
    <P>1. Such a class must be one that has been <I>economically exploited and
      politically oppressed </I>under capitalist society; otherwise, the class
      will have no reason for resisting the capitalist order; it will not rebel
      under any circumstances. </P>
    
    <P>2. It follows - to put the matter crudely - that it must be a <I>poor
      class; </I>for otherwise it will have no opportunity to feel its poverty
      as compared with the wealth of other classes. </P>
    
    <P>3. It must be a <I>producing </I>class; for, if it is not, <I>i.e.,
      </I>if it has no immediate share in the production of values, it may at
      best destroy, being unable to produce, create, organize. </P>
    
    <P>4. It must be a class that is <I>not bound by private property, </I>for
      a class whose material existence is based on private property will
      naturally be inclined to increase its property, not to abolish private
      property, as is demanded by communism. </P>
    
    <P>5. This class must be one which has been <I>welded together </I>by the
      conditions of its existence and its common labor, its members working side
      by side. Otherwise, it will be incapable of desiring - not to mention
      constructing - a society that is the embodiment of the social labor of
      comrades. Furthermore, such a class could not wage an <I>organized </I>struggle
      or create a new state power. </P>
    
    <P>In the following table, the presence or absence of these characteristics
      in the various classes and groups is indicated by a + or - sign.</P>

    <P>In other words, the peasantry-for instance-lack several elements
      necessary to make them a communist class: they are bound down by <I>property,
      </I>and it will take many years to train them to a new view, which can
      only be done by having the state power in the hands of the proletariat;
      also, the peasantry are not held together in production, in <I>social
      </I>labor and common action; on the contrary, the peasant's entire joy is
      in his own bit of land; he is accustomed to <I>individual </I>management,
      not to cooperation with others. The <I>lumpenproletariat, </I>however, is
      barred chiefly by the circumstance that it performs no productive work; it
      can tear down, but has no habit of building up. Its ideology is often
      represented by the anarchists, concerning whom a wag once said that their
      whole program consists of two paragraphs. <I>Para.</I> 1. There shall be
      no order at all; <I>Para. </I>2. No one shall be obliged to
      comply with the preceding paragraph.</P>
    
    <P>We have thus seen how the conditions of material existence determine the
      psychology and ideology of classes in groups; the proletariat shows:
      hatred against capital and its state power, revolutionary spirit, the
      habit of organized action, a psychology of comradeship, a productive and
      constructive conception of things, a rejection of the traditional, a
      negative attitude on the &quot;sacredness of private property&quot;, that
      pillar of bourgeois society, etc.; in the peasantry: love of private
      property, preventing them from favoring innovation; individualism,
      exclusiveness, suspicion of everything lying outside the village; in the
      <I>luvnpenproletariat: </I>shiftlessness , lack of discipline hatred of
      the old, but impotence to construct or organize anything new, an
      individualistic declassed &quot;personality&quot;, whose actions are based
      only on foolish caprices. In each of the above classes, we find the
      ideology that corresponds to its psychology: in the proletariat,
      revolutionary communism; in the peasantry, a property ideology; in the
      <I>lumpen proletariat, </I>a vacillating and hysterical anarchism.
      Obviously, once such psychological and theological nucleus is present, it
      will set the fundamental note for the entire psychology and ideology of
      the class or group concerned.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the old discussions between Marxists and
      Social-Revolutionaries, the latter usually formulated the question from
      the point of view of philanthropy, &quot;ethics&quot;, &quot;compassion&quot;
      for the &quot;weaker brother&quot;, and similar rubbish of a ruling class
      intellectual nature. For most of these &quot;ideologists&quot;, the
      question of class was an ethical question of the intellectual, with his
      qualms of conscience, who, in his desire to overthrow absolutism, which
      was an obstacle in his path, sought support in the peasant (so long as the
      latter did not set fire to the estates of the intellectual's aunties and
      uncles), whose confidence he wished to gain, thus compensating for his own
      guilt by his noble-minded assistance. The Marxists, however, were not
      concerned with lacrimose sentiments or philanthropy, but with a precise
      study of class peculiarities, with <I>finding out </I>what class would
      lead in the impending struggle for socialism.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">A good study (although conservative and apologetic,
      supporting the Black Hundred) of the psychology of the peasant is to be
      found in the book of the evangelical pastor A. L'Houet (<I>Zur
      Psychologie des Bauerntums, </I>2nd ed., Tübingen, 1920). This
      learned Christian dominie esteems Germany's peasantry &quot;above all as
      its supply of bodily, mental, moral, and religious health, as the Reich's
      war-hoard&quot; (p.4; L'Houet means <I>cannon-fodder</I>). The pastor,
      who finds among the earmarks of the firmly rooted peasantry: its &quot;homogeneous
      mass&quot;, its exclusiveness to the outside world, its fidelity to
      tradition, etc., gives an excellent description of the class psychology of
      the peasantry but he is inspired with feelings of rapture with those of
      its qualities that we regard as the &quot;idiotism of country life&quot;
      (Marx). For instance, L'Houet praises the <I>inertia </I>of the
      peasantry, its aversion to innovation. &quot;As contrasted with this
      outspoken preference for everything that is new, the peasant unmistakably
      belongs to a world that reveres the old, that retains the ancient themes
      of life, continues to spin the old thread, to roll the old stones. With
      the disadvantage that he `remains behind the times', `does not keep
      abreast of the times but with the great advantage that all the
      achievements of his life, by reason of this one-sidedness, are
      characterized by reliability, solidity tried and true methods&quot;
      (p.16). This inertia is found everywhere in the preservation of the
      original settlement, of the old home, of the old farm-names, baptismal
      names, costumes, the old dialect, the old folk poetry, the old mechanism
      of the soul, the old faces! In all, we find the same old conservative
      sense.&quot; (p.16). Herr L'Houet is delighted with the fact that peasant
      dwellings in 1871 were practically the same as in the Stone Age. He
      rejoices in the hereditary simplicity and poverty of the psyche, in the
      fact &quot;that the number of life problems faced at any moment, in a
      religious, moral, artistic sense or whatever other sense - is not very
      large, that each generation hands down the same supply of these things to
      the next&quot; (p.29). He is pleased to find that these limitations, this &quot;idiotism&quot;
      - not the fault but the misfortune of the peasantry - is not destroyed by
      steam and electricity, for this &quot;principle of the past&quot; is the
      basis of a simple grandiose existence in the ancient sense&quot; (!!).
      <I>&quot;Solidity&quot;, </I>thrift and avarice, <I>lust for possession,
      </I>etc., are of course also highly esteemed by our dominie (as on p.6,
      for instance). These examples fully express the character of the class
      psychology and class ideology of landlords and their priests, who cherish
      and nurse precisely those qualities of the peasantry that prevent it from
      &quot;advancing with the times&quot;.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The class psychology of the <I>country nobility (i.e.,
      </I>the feudal landholders) is characterized by the same outspoken
      conservative and reactionary spirit, which no other class possesses to the
      same degree. This is not hard to understand; the feudal landholders, as we
      know, are the representatives of feudal society, which has now passed away
      in almost all countries. Fidelity to tradition, to the &quot;established
      forms of worship of the aristocratic family (its excellences, its fame,
      its worth&quot;), symbolically expressed in the &quot;ancestral tree&quot;;
      &quot;merit and service&quot; the estate, the honor appropriate to &quot;noble
      station&quot;, contempt for those of lower station, the attempt to limit
      sexual and all other intercourse to those of like station only; these are
      the characteristic traits of this once ruling class (<I>cf</I>. G.
      Simmel: <I>Soziologie</I>, p.737<I> et seq</I>.).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The psychology and ideology in the classes of bourgeois
      society, i.e., the urban classes, are far more mobile. The bourgeoisie,
      particularly when it was a rising class, not directly threatened by the
      proletarian by no means presented the conservatism of the nobility. Its
      characteristic traits were: <I>individualism, </I>a result of the
      competitive struggle, and <I>rationalism, </I>a result of economic
      calculation, these conditions being the basis of the life of this class.
      The <I>liberal </I>psychology (various &quot;liberties&quot;), and
      ideology were based on the &quot;initiative of the entrepreneur&quot;.
      Very interesting observations are made by Werner Sombart and Max Weber,
      particularly on the economic psychology of the bourgeoisie and the various
      stages in its development. Thus Sombart traces the rise of the
      entrepreneur psychology, which arose necessarily from the fusing of three
      psychological types: that of the conqueror, of the organizer, of the
      trader; from the conqueror, it takes the ability to make plans, to carry
      them out; the conqueror has &quot;toughness and persistence . . .
      elasticity, mental energy, high tension, an indomitable will&quot;; the
      organizer must be able to &quot;control men and things in such manner as
      to obtain the desired profit without any reduction&quot;; the trader, the
      merchant, is capable of trading and profiting by trade (Sombart: <I>Der
      Bourgeois, </I>München and Leipzig, 1913, p.70 <I>et seq</I>.). The
      bourgeoisie was characterized at the period of its highest development by
      a combination of these three traits. We have already discussed the
      psychology of the proletariat, as our whole book is concerned with the
      proletariat.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>It is obvious that the psychology and ideology of the classes <I>will
      change, depending on the alterations in the &quot;`social being&quot; </I>of
      the corresponding classes, as has been repeatedly stated in the preceding
      chapters. One thing should still be mentioned: <I>the psychology&quot; of
      the intermediate classes also constitutes an intermediate stage, while
      that of the mixed groups is a mixed psychology, etc. </I>This also
      explains the fact that the bourgeoisie and the peasantry, for example, are
      constantly &quot;vacillating&quot; between proletariat and bourgeoisie,
      for &quot;two souls - alas! - dwell in their breast&quot;, etc. As Marx
      puts the matter in his <I>Der Achtzehnte Brumaire des Louis Bonaparte
      </I>(Hamburg 1885, p.33): &quot;Over the various forms of property, over
      the social conditions of existence, there rises an entire superstructure
      of various peculiarly constituted feelings, illusions, modes of thought,
      and views of life. The entire class creates these out of its material
      foundations, as well as out of the corresponding social relations.&quot;</P>
    
    <H4><a name="d"></a>d. The &quot;Class in Itself&quot;, and the &quot;Class for Itself&quot;</H4>
    
    <P>Class psychology and class ideology, the consciousness of the class not
      only as to its momentary interests, but also as to permanent and universal
      interests, are a result of the position of the class in production, which
      by no means signifies that this position of the class will <I>at once
      </I>produce in it a consciousness of its general and basic interests. On
      the contrary, it may be said that this is rarely the case. For, in the
      first place, the process of production itself, in actual life, goes
      through a number of stages of evolution, and the contradictions in the
      economic structure do not become apparent until a later period of
      evolution; in the second place, a class does not descend full-grown from
      heaven, but grows in a crude elemental manner from a number of other
      social groups (transition classes, intermediate and other classes, strata,
      social combinations); in the third place, a certain time usually passes
      before a class becomes conscious of itself through experience in battle,
      of its special and peculiar interests, aspirations, social &quot;ideals&quot;
      and desires, which emphatically distinguish it from all the other classes
      in the given society; in the fourth place, we must not forget the
      systematic psychological and ideological manipulation conducted by the
      ruling class with the aid of its state machinery for the purpose of
      destroying the incipient class consciousness of the oppressed classes, and
      to imbue them with the ideology of the ruling class, or at least to
      influence them somewhat with this ideology. The result is that a class
      discharging a definite function in the process of production may
      already exist as an aggregate of persons before it exists as a
      self-conscious class; we have a class, but no class consciousness. It
      exists as a factor in production, as a specific aggregate of production
      relations; it does not yet exist as a social, independent <I>force</I>
      that knows what it wants, that feels a mission, that is <I>conscious </I>of
      its peculiar position, of the hostility of its interests to those of the
      other classes. As designations for these different stages in the process
      of class evolution, Marx makes use of two expressions: he calls class <I>&quot;an
      sich&quot; </I>(<I>in itself</I>),<I> a class </I>not yet conscious of
      itself as such; he calls <I>class &quot;für sich&quot; (for itself</I>),
      a class already conscious of its social role.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This has been splendidly explained by Marx in <I>The
      Poverty of Philosophy, </I>in the case of working class evolution:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">&quot;It is under the form of these combinations that
      the first attempts at association among themselves have always been made
      by the workers. The great industry masses together in a single place a
      crowd of people unknown to each other. Competition divides their
      interests. But the maintenance of their wages, this common interest which
      they have against their employer, unites them in the same idea of
      resistance <I>- combination. </I>(<I>Combination </I>here means workers'
      combination, <I>N.B</I>.) Thus combination has always a double end, that
      of eliminating competition among themselves while enabling them to make a
      general competition against the capitalist. If the first object of
      resistance has been merely to maintain wages, in proportion as the
      capitalists in their turn have combined with the idea of repression, the
      combinations, at first isolated, have formed in groups, and, in face of
      constantly united capital, the maintenance of the association became more
      important and necessary for them than the maintenance of wages. This is so
      true that the English economists are all astonished at seeing the workers
      sacrifice a good part of their wages on behalf of the associations which,
      in the eyes of these economists, were only established in support of
      wages. In this struggle - a veritable civil war - are united and
      established all the elements necessary for a future battle. Once arrived
      at that point, association takes on a political character.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">&quot;The economic conditions have in the first place
      transformed the mass of the people of the country into wage workers. The
      domination of capital has created for this mass of people a common
      situation with common interests. Thus this mass is already a class, as
      opposed <I>to capital, </I>but <I>not yet for itself. </I>In the
      struggle, of which we have only noted some phases, this mass unites, it is
      constituted <I>as a class for itself. </I>The interests which it defends
      are the <I>interests of its class.&quot; </I>(<I>The Poverty of

    <H4><a name="e"></a>e. Forms of a Relative Solidarity of Interests</H4>
    
    <P>From what has been said above, it is clear that under certain
      circumstances a <I>relative </I>class solidarity becomes possible; two
      principal forms may be distinguished.</P>
    
    <P>In the first place, we have the form of solidarity in which the
      permanent interest of one class coincides with the temporary interest of
      another class, while this temporary interest may contradict the general
      class interest.</P>
    
    <P>In the second place, we may have a form of solidarity in which this
      contradiction is lacking, and in which we may yet have a coincidence
      between the permanent interests of one class and the temporary interests
      of another class, or between temporary interests of both classes.</P>
    
    <P>The first form may be illustrated by an example from the imperialist war
      of 1914-1918, namely, the attitude of the working classes at the <I>beginning
      </I>of this war. It is well known that in most of the great advanced
      capitalist countries, the workers, contrary to their internationalist
      class interests, rushed to the defense of their &quot;fatherlands&quot;.
      Their &quot;fatherlands&quot; were of course only the state organizations
      of the bourgeoisie, <I>i.e., class </I>organizations of capital. We
      therefore find the working class defending the organizations of its
      employers, which had come into conflict with each other for the division
      of markets, sources of raw materials, spheres of investments for their
      funds; this was certainly a sacrifice of the workers' own class interests,
      due to a condition of <I>relative solidarity </I>between the proletariat
      and the bourgeoisie in the nations of financial capitalism. We may
      understand this condition by imagining the entire system of world economy
      to be a countless number of intersecting threads - the production
      relations - meeting at several points in big, thick knots: the great
      capitalist countries, where live the &quot;national&quot; groups of the
      bourgeoisie, organized as a state authority. They remind us of the huge
      enterprises, the gigantic trusts, operative in world economy. The more
      powerful such a state becomes, the more mercilessly will it exploit its
      economic periphery: the colonies, spheres of influence, semi-colonies,
      etc. As capitalist society develops, the condition of the working class
      should become poorer. But the predatory states of the bourgeoisie, which
      hoodwink the workers in The &quot;spheres of influence&quot;, were feeding
      &quot;their own&quot; workers and making them take an interest in the
      exploitation of the colonies. This condition brought about a relative
      material interest between the imperialist bourgeoisie and the proletariat;
      these production relations gave rise to a corresponding psychology and
      ideology, resulting in a recognition of the duty to defend one's country.
      The course of reasoning was simple: if &quot;our&quot; industry (which
      happens not to be &quot;ours&quot;, but that of our employers) develops,
      wages will increase; but industry expands by obtaining markets, and
      spheres for the investment of capital; consequently the working class has
      an interest in the colonial policy of the bourgeoisie, must defend the &quot;nation's
      industry&quot;, must fight for the nation's &quot;place in the sun&quot;.
      All the other things followed naturally: laudation of one's mighty
      fatherland, the great nation, etc., and the endless high-sounding rhetoric
      about humanity, civilization, democracy, unselfishness, etc., so prevalent
      in the first stage of the World War. This was the ideology of &quot;labor
      imperialism&quot;, leading the working class to sacrifice permanent and
      general interests for the crumbs thrown to it by the bourgeoisie as the
      latter squeezed the last drop out of the colonial laborers, semi-laborers,
      etc., etc. Ultimately, the course of the war and of the post-war period
      showed the working class that it had lost the game, that the permanent
      interests of the class are more important than its temporary interests.
      There ensued the process of a swift &quot;revolutionizing&quot; of minds.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The late Professor Tugan-Baranovsky, a &quot;pseudo-Marxist&quot;,
      for a time a White Minister, in the early stage of the Russian revolution
      (for pure &quot;ethics&quot;; he always reproved Marx for his lack of
      ethics, his permitting himself to be carried away by class hatred, which
      is, of course, quite vicious) - this Tugan-Baranovsky takes up the cudgels
      against Marx in the following terms: Marx does not see the solidarity of
      interests, denies its presence in capitalist society; yet &quot;all social
      classes are equally interested in the preservation of the political
      independence of the state, insofar as the latter has an ideal worth in
      their eyes. In the economic field, the state not only serves to establish
      class rule, but also to advance economic progress, enhancing the total
      national wealth, which is in accord with the interests of all classes of
      society. In addition, we have the cultural mission of the state, which is
      interested in the advance of education, and in raising the mental level of
      the population, if only for the reason that political and economic power
      cannot be separated from the advance of culture.&quot; (<I>Theoretische
      Grundlagen des Marxismus</I>, p.114.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Herr Cunow (<I>ibid</I>., vol. ii, pp.78, 79) quotes
      and supports this passage from Tugan, asserting, however, that Tugan here
      confuses social interests with the interests of the state. In reality,
      Cunow is confusing the revolutionary standpoint of Marx with the traitor
      standpoint of the Scheidemanns. The Tugan-Cunow reasoning is truly
      childish. We are told that the state <I>is not only </I>concerned with
      oppression, but also concerned with it; therefore, all classes have <I>an
      </I>interest in the state. By this method anything might be proved.
      Since,. the trusts are not <I>only </I>concerned with exploitation, <I>&quot;but
      </I>also&quot; (!) arer concerned with production, they are of general
      utility. Since the detective bureaus in America <I>not only </I>twist the
      arms of revolutionary proletarians, <I>&quot;but also&quot; </I>catch
      thieves, all classes have an interest to them, etc. It is with stuff of
      this kind that Herr Cunow fills the two volumes of his study on Marxian
      sociology!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Cunow, however, excels all the distorters of Marxism
      with cynical impudence:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">&quot;According to the Marxian theory of society,&quot;
      we read (vol. ii, p.77<I> et seq., </I>of Cunow's work), &quot;any such
      general will as so excellently served the purposes of the older social
      philosophy, does not exist; for society is not a unified thing with
      perfectly uniform interests (?! society!), but it is divided into classes
      (not so bad; but what is Cunow going to do with the state? Whose will is
      expressed by the state? <I>N.B</I>.). To be sure, there are also general
      social interests, for, since a living and working together in society is
      impossible without a certain order, all the members of society - with the
      exception of those who question the existence of society at all - are
      interested in maintaining this order; but, since they have different <I>ideals
      of order, </I>depending on their different positions within the social
      order, they have not the same interest in the various rules of this order,
      which they regard from various points of view, depending on the class
      angle of their vision.&quot; To put the matter in plain words; men may
      think that it is the bourgeoisie that is interested in preserving the
      capitalist order, while the proletariat is interested in overthrowing this
      order; but nothing could be further from the truth. The wise Cunow sets us
      right on this subject: since life is impossible without order, all have an
      interest in maintaining capitalism. But since the workers have a different
      &quot;ideal of order&quot;, let them &quot;criticize the various rules of
      the order&quot; - so much Cunow will permit. But don't dare go beyond
      that, for then you will be one of the persons who &quot;question the
      existence of society at all&quot;. This is Marxism as revised and
      supplemented by Cunow !</FONT></P>
    
    <P>We may also take as an example that period in the evolution of the
      working class when it lived in a so called &quot;patriarchal&quot;
      relation with the entrepreneurs in each specific industry; in view of the
      general weakness of social institutions, the workers had an interest in
      the success of the enterprise. The workers and their &quot;benefactors&quot;,
      their employers, afford an excellent illustration of a relative solidarity
      of interests at the expense of the general class interests.</P>
    
    <P>A certain analogy is afforded by the community of interests between <I>slaves
      </I>and <I>slaveholders </I>in antiquity, so long as there were still &quot;slaves
      of the slaves&quot; (the Roman <I>vicarii). </I>The slaves who held
      slaves were themselves slave-owners, their interests thus coincided, to
      this extent, with the slaveholders of the &quot;first degree&quot;. In the
      present-day agricultural cooperatives in Western Europe we often find the
      peasantry working hand in hand with the great landlords and the capitalist
      estate owners. The peasants unite with the others in order to dispose of
      their agricultural products; being <I>sellers, </I>they are opposed to
      the urban population; they desire high <I>prices </I>as much as does the
      wealthy estate-owner.</P>
    
    <P>We are now already leaving the outlines of the first form of solidarity,
      since in this case a true agricultural bourgeoisie, recruited from the
      peasantry, differs in no respect from the hereditary agricultural
      bourgeoisie.</P>
    
    <P>The best examples of the <I>second </I>form of relative class
      solidarity, namely, where this relative solidarity is not in contradiction
      with the permanent interests of the classes involved, are found in cases
      of class attacks against the common enemy, which are quite possible at a
      certain stage of evolution. For example, in the first phase of the French
      Revolution, the feudal system was opposed by <I>different </I>classes,
      both in economy as well as in politics: the bourgeoisie, the petty
      bourgeoisie, the proletariat, all these groups being interested in
      overthrowing feudalism. Of course, this general <I>bloc</I> later
      disintegrated, and the petty bourgeoisie, in spite of its struggles
      against the great bourgeoisie, which had become counter-revolutionary,
      simultaneously fought the incipient proletarian movement ruthlessly. Here
      we have a temporary class solidarity at variance with the general and
      permanent interests of the classes.</P>
    
    <H4><a name="f"></a>f. Class Struggle and Class Peace</H4>
    
    <P>Various gradations of interest give rise to various forms of struggle.
      As already shown, not every interest of a section of a main class is for
      that reason the class interest. If the interest <I>of </I>the workers of
      a single factory contradicts the interests of the remaining sections of
      the working class, we have not a class interest, but a group interest. But
      even when we are dealing with the interest of a group of workers which
      does not collide with the interests of other groups, the groups may yet
      fail to be united, class interest being absent in the consciousness of the
      classes; strictly speaking, there is yet no class struggle: the beginnings
      of a class interest, the germs of a class struggle, are present. A <I>class
      interest arises when. it places one class in opposition to another. The
      class struggle arises when it throws one class into active conflict with
      the other. </I>Class struggle, therefore, in the true sense, develops only
      at a specific stage in the evolution of class society. In other phases of
      social evolution it reveals itself as a <I>germ-form </I>(individual
      sections of the class are fighting; the struggle has not yet advanced to
      embrace the class as a principle, uniting the entire class), or as a
      concealed, &quot;latent&quot; form (open conflict does not ensue; &quot;stolid
      resistance&quot; is offered; the ruling class is forced to pay attention
      to this resistance). &quot;Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian,
      baron and serf, guild member and apprentice, in short, oppressors` and
      oppressed all were opposed in like manner to each other, waged ¢! an
      uninterrupted, now hidden, now open battle, a battle that always
      terminated in a revolutionary transformation of the whole society or with
      a common destruction of the struggling classes&quot; <I>(The Communist
      Manifesto). </I>It will be useful to consider a few more examples.</P>
    
    <P>Let us suppose, in a slaveholding society, that an insurrection is
      taking place in a latifundium belonging to a great landowner; there is
      plundering, damage to things and persons, etc. We may Fl not call this a
      class struggle in the proper sense of the word: it is the elemental fury
      of a small section of the slave class. The class as a whole is calm; a
      small band wages a bitter struggle, but remains isolated, includes but few
      in its numbers. The class <I>as such </I>does not come into action; one
      class is here not opposing another. Quite different is the case when the
      rebellious slaves, led by Spartacus, fought a real civil war for their
      liberation; here the slave <I>masses </I>were carried away: this is class
      struggle.</P>
    
    <P>Or, let us consider the example of a movement for higher wages among the
      wage workers of a factory. If all the other workers in the country remain
      calm, we have only the promise of a class struggle, for the class as yet
      is not kindled. Let us consider, however, the case of a &quot;strike wave&quot;.
      This is class struggle: one class stands opposed to the other. We are no
      longer dealing with the interests of the group impelling another group,
      but with the interests of a class impelling another class.</P>
    
    <P>The example of the peasant serf is also interesting. Among, these serfs,
      there was a vague, sullen discontent; this feeling may break out, but
      since the class as a whole continues to be held down, it does not do so;
      the slaves, in terror, do not fight, but &quot;mutter&quot;.' This is the &quot;concealed&quot;
      form of the struggle, mentioned by Marx. Class struggle therefore means a
      struggle in which <I>one class has entered into action against the other
      class. </I>From this arises the extremely important principle that <I>&quot;every
      class struggle is a</I> <I>political struggle&quot; </I>(Marx). Indeed,
      when the oppressed class rises as a class power to oppose the oppressing
      class, this signifies that the oppressed class is undermining the bases of
      the existing order. And since the organization of <I>power </I>of the
      existing order is the <I>state </I>organization of the commanding class,
      it is obvious that each action of the oppressed class is directly aimed
      against the state mechanism, even though the participants in the struggle
      of the oppressed class may not at first be fully conscious of their
      hostility to the state power. Each such action is therefore necessarily
      political in character.</P>
    
    <P>An interesting error of the I.W.W., in the United States, and of
      revolutionary syndicalists in general, may be detected by applying this
      principle. The I.W.W. reject the political struggle entirely, for they
      naively understand it to be synonymous with the parliamentary struggle.
      But if the I.W.W. should organize a general strike, or only a strike of
      railroad workers, miners and metal workers, it is obvious that this strike
      would have an immense <I>political </I>value, because it would have
      succeeded in organizing the most important armies of the proletariat, in
      terrifying the bourgeoisie as a class, in threatening to cut a breach in
      the machinery of the organized bourgeoisie; and therefore, because this
      strike would be directed, in reality, against the state power of the
      bourgeoisie.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This transformation of the individual episodes of
      conflict into the class struggle, in the case of the proletariat is
      excellently shown by Marx in the <I>Communist Manifesto. </I>&quot;Now
      and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit
      of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the expanding
      unison of the workers. This unison is helped on by the improved means of
      communication that are created by modern industry, and that place the
      workers of different localities in contact with one another. It was just
      this contact that was needed to centralize the numerous local struggles,
      of the same character, into <I>one national struggle between classes, but
      every class struggle is a political struggle:&quot; </I>(<I>Communist
      Manifesto</I>,.Chicago, 1912, pp.24, 25.) Marx defines this transformation
      of the various conflicts into a class, <I>i.e., </I>political conflict,
      as follows: <I>&quot;Nota bene ad </I>political movement: The <I>political
      movement </I>of the working class has of course, the final object of
      conquering the <I>political power </I>for that class, which requires, of
      course, a previous organization of the <I>working class </I>to a certain
      point, which organization is conditioned by its own economic struggle. On
      the other hand, any movement in which the working class is opposed as a
      class to its rulers, seeking to compel them by <I>pressure from without,
      is </I>a <I>political movement&quot; Briefe an Sorge, </I>p.240, also
      quoted by Cunow, <I>ibid</I>., vol. ii, p.59) the italicized passages are
      in English in Marx's letter; both Marx and Engels, owing to their long
      stay in England, interlarded their letters with English words. <I>Translator</I>).
      Herr Cunow, in quoting this passage, interprets it as follows: &quot;at a
      certain stage in evolution, various social classes develop out of the
      economic process as a whole, with their special economic interests, in
      accordance with their role in this process, and attempt to put through
      these interests in the political life&quot; (<I>ibid</I>., vol. ii,
      p.59). This commentary is not quite correct, for Cunow suppresses the most
      important point, the point to which Marx gives chief emphasis: the
      opposition of one class to the other in principle, when each struggle is a
      portion of the process of the general struggle for power and for
      domination in society.</FONT></P>

      Vol. 182, no. 2, p.157 <I>et seq</I>.), Professor Hans Delbrück &quot;criticizes&quot;
      the theory of the class struggle, simultaneously displaying a truly
      titanic ignorance in matters of Marxism. On p.165 he maintains that Marx
      failed to distinguish classes from castes; on p.156 he states that there
      was no &quot;destruction&quot; of the two classes in ancient Rome, while
      he admits the decline of the Roman Empire to be an undeniable fact. First
      there were civil wars, after which neither the victors nor the vanquished
      slaves were capable of leading society onward. On p.167 he says that
      feudalism never existed in England! On p.169 he &quot;refutes&quot; Marx
      with the fact that the peasants sometimes join hands with the Junkers (<I>cf.
      </I>our own remarks in large type), etc. But the gem of his &quot;objections&quot;
      is the following example. Delbrück quotes an ancient text discovered
      by the well-known Egyptologist, Ehrmann, in which we' read of the ancient
      Egyptian revolution, in which the slaves managed to seize power. This text
      is interesting in that it might have been written by Merezhkovsky or any
      other White Guard gentleman in his rage against the Bolsheviks; It depicts
      the most frightful atrocities. Herr Delbrück calls our attention to
      this horrible example of the class struggle? But this worthy and truly
      German professor falls quite unwittingly into his own trap when he adds
      the words that this condition lasted for &quot;three hundred years&quot;
      (p.171). Any fool would know that there can be no possibility of
      maintaining life for three hundred years in a state of absolute anarchy
      and without production. Things, therefore, cannot have been quite so bad,

      Struggle in History, </I>Petersburg, 1910, in Russian); his chief
      objection is the following. After quoting this passage from Engels: It was
      Marx,; himself who had first discovered the complete law of motion of
      history the law according to which all historical struggles, whether
      proceeding on the political, religious, philosophical, or any other
      ideological ground, are in fact only the more or less distinct expression
      of the struggles between social classes&quot; (Marx: <I>Der Achtzehnte
      Brumaire des Louis Bonaparte, </I>Hamburg, 1885, Engels' preface to the
      2nd ed.), Mr. Delevsky states that he agrees with Sombart's opinion that
      the principle of the class struggle must be replaced by the principle of
      the <I>struggle between nations. </I>The objection of Plekhanov, who said
      that nothing need be added here, since the class struggle is a conception
      connected with the internal processes of society and not with the
      relations between societies, is considered insufficient by Mr. Delevsky. &quot;Either
      - or&quot;, writes Mr. Delevsky, &quot;either history is based on two
      principles or on one. If on two principles - that of the class
      struggle and that of the struggle between nations - what is the law which
      is formulated in the second principle? . . But if &quot; we have only the
      principle of the class struggle, what sense is there in distinguishing the
      struggle within society from the struggle between societies? &quot; Or,
      perhaps the societies, nations, states, are likewise classes?&quot;
      (p.92), This statement is truly delightful. Let us look into the matter;
      two fundamental situations are possible: either we dealing with a society
      ( for instance, the world-wide economy of the present day) divided into
      the state organizations of the &quot;national&quot; sections of the
      bourgeoisie, or with the rather <I>loose, different </I>societies (for
      instance, if war is waged between different peoples, one of which -
      let us say - has suddenly intruded from very remote regions, as has
      happened repeatedly in the course of history: the conquest of Mexico by
      the Spaniards is an example). In this <I>first case, </I>the struggle
      between the bourgeoisies is a special form of capitalist competition. No
      one but Delevsky could even imagine that the theory of the class struggle
      would exclude, for instance, capitalist competition, which is a form of
      the antagonisms within the class, which have never succeeded in altering
      the bases of the given structure of production. While the Marxian theory
      recognizes the possibility of a relative clarity between classes, it also
      recognizes the possibility of a relative antagonism within the classes. It
      is hard to see how this refutes the theory of the class struggle. <I>Second
      case. </I>This is a methodological question. The theory of the evolution
      of society is the theory of an evolution of an <I>abstract </I>society,
      and it is quite true that this theory does not need to concern itself with
      the relations between societies; it analyzes the nature of society <I>in
      general, </I>ascertaining the laws of evolution of this &quot;society in
      general&quot;. But if we leave these questions in favor of more concrete
      questions, i.e., among others, the question of the relations between the
      various societies, we shall again obtain special laws, which in their turn
      are also not in contradiction with the Marxian theory; not for the reason
      that the different societies are different classes (this assumption of Mr.
      Delevsky is simply wrong), but because &quot;expansion&quot; itself has
      economic causes, since - let us say - conquest inevitably is transformed
      into a regrouping of class forces; because in such cases the higher mode
      of production &quot;below&quot; always carries off the victory, etc.
      Nothing in this invalidates in any way the theory of the class struggle.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>We have therefore seen that the oppressed classes do not always wage a
      class struggle in the proper sense of the word, which by no means
      signifies - as we have also seen - that such comparatively peaceful epochs
      are filled with nothing but peace and harmony. It merely signifies that
      the class struggle is proceeding in a concealed or incipient farm. It will
      <I>later </I>become a class struggle in the true sense of the word. Let
      us not forget that dialectics conceives everything as in course of <I>motion</I>,
      evolution. Even if the class struggle be absent, it is <I>evolving, </I>it
      &quot;grows&quot;. Such is the case with the oppressed classes. As for the
      ruling classes, they are waging the class struggle <I>unceasingly. </I>For
      the existence of the state organization proves that the ruling class has
      constituted itself as a class <I>for itself, </I>as a state power. This
      implies a complete consciousness of the fundamental interests of this
      class, which wages war with the classes whose interests oppose it (war
      against the immediate danger as well as against possible dangers), for
      which purpose it makes use of all the instruments of the state machinery.</P>
    
    <H4><a name="g"></a>g. The Class Struggle and the State Power</H4>
    
    <P>We have already considered the problem of the state as a superstructure
      determined by the economic basis (see first part of &quot;The
      Superstructure and its Outlines,&quot; chapter vi, <I>d, </I>of this
      work). We must now approach this question from another angle, namely, that
      of the class struggle. We must again emphatically point out that the state
      organization is <I>exclusively a class organization</I>; it is the class
      which &quot;has constituted its state power&quot;, it is the &quot;concentrated&quot;
      and organized social authority of the class (Marx). The oppressed class,
      the bearer of the new mode of production, in the course of the struggle,
      as we have seen - becomes transformed from a class in <I>itself </I>into
      a class <I>for itself; </I>in this struggle, it creates its fighting
      organizations, which to an increasing degree build up organizations that
      carry with them the entire mass of the given class. When revolution, civil
      war, etc., is at hand, these organizations break through the enemy's front
      and constitute the first cells of the new state mechanism in open or
      concealed form. For example, in the French Revolution: &quot;The
      `people's' or Jacobin groups - the former Societies of Friends of the
      Constitution, were at first bourgeois and now became democratic,
      Montagnards, Sansculottes, advocates of equality and unity . . . . They
      were founded for the purpose of popular enlightenment, for propaganda
      rather than for action; but circumstances forced them into political
      action, to participate directly in the administration (when the petty
      bourgeoisie came to the helm. <I>N.B</I>.). By the Decree of 14th
      Frimaire, the Jacobins in all of France became the electors and the
      purifiers of the officialdom.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#2" NAME="2b">2)</A></SUP>
      &quot;Taking everything into consideration . . . it was precisely the
      Jacobin clubs that now maintained unity and saved the country.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#3" NAME="3b">3)</A></SUP>
      In the English Revolution, the revolutionary &quot;Army Council&quot;
      provided the men for the State Council. During the Russlan revolution the
      fighting organizations of the workers and soldiers - the soviets - and the
      extreme revolutionary party - the communists - became the fundamental
      organizations of the new state.</P>
    
    <P>Two types of arguments are used in objecting to the class conception of
      the state authority.</P>
    
    <P>The first type is of the following kind: the peculiarity of the 6tate is
      its centralized administration; therefore, the anarchists tell us, any
      centralized administration is a state authority. Therefore, even the most
      advanced communist society, if it has a systematic economy, will also be a
      state. This reasoning is based entirely on the naive bourgeois error:
      bourgeois science, instead of perceiving special relations, perceives
      relations between <I>things, </I>or <I>technical </I>relations. But it
      is obvious that the &quot;essence&quot; of the state is not in the <I>thing
      </I>but in the social relation; not in the centralized administration as
      such, but in the class <I>envelope </I>of the centralized administration.
      As capital is not a thing (as is, for instance, a machine), but a social
      relation between workers and employers, a relation expressed by means of a
      thing, so centralization <I>per se </I>by no means necessarily signifies
      a state organization; it does not become a state organization until it
      expresses a class relation.</P>
    
    <P>The second objection to the class theory of the state has already been
      considered, in part. This objection is still more ridiculous, being based
      on the conception that the state discharges a number of generally useful
      functions (for example, the modern capitalist state builds electrical
      power stations, hospitals, railroads, etc.). This argument unites most
      pathetically in one group: the Social-Democrat Cunow, the Right
      Social-Revolutionary J. Delevsky, the conservative Delbrück, and even
      the Babylonian king Hammurabi! But this honorable company is much
      mistaken. For the existence of generally useful functions on the part of
      the state does not alter the pure class character of the state authority.
      The ruling class is obliged to resort to all kinds of &quot;generally
      useful&quot; enterprises in order to maintain its ability to exploit the
      masses, extend its field of exploitation, and secure the &quot;normal&quot;
      working of this exploitation. Capitalism can of course not develop
      properly without an extensive railroad system, without trade schools (if
      there are no skilled laborers, no scientific institutes, there will be no
      improvement in capitalist technique, etc., etc.). In all these measures,
      the state power of the capitalists is guided by its class interests. We
      have already given the trusts as an example; the trust also guides
      production, without which society. cannot exist, but it guides production
      in the direction of its class advantage. Or, to take the example of some
      ancient despotic state of great landlords, such as that of the Egyptian
      Pharaohs, whose huge constructions for regulating the course of rivers
      were of general utility. The Pharaonic state did not, however, maintain
      these constructions for the purpose of averting hardship for the starving,
      or subserving the general weal, but merely because they were a necessary
      condition for the process of production, which was simultaneously a <I>process
      of exploitation. </I>Class advantage was the basic impulse in activity;
      such measures may not be taken, therefore, as a proof of the incorrectness
      of the class point of view.</P>
    
    <P>Another group of generally useful measures is called forth by the
      oppression of the &quot;lower classes&quot;, for example, the labor
      protection legislation in capitalist countries. Many hair-splitting
      scholars (like the Russian pseudo-sociologist, Takhtarev) therefore do not
      consider the state as a pure class organization, for it is based
      ultimately on a compromise. A moment's thought will correct this view.
      Does the capitalist, for instance, cease to be &quot;pure capitalist&quot;,
      because his fear of strikes makes him see advantage <I>to himself </I>of
      making concessions? Likewise, the state may make concessions to other
      classes, as the employer, in the above example, makes concessions to the
      workers. But does not signify that the state ceases to be a pure class
      state, an organization of a class bloc, <I>i.e., </I>becoming a truly and
      generally useful organization.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Naturally, Herr Cunow does not understand this either.
      It is a pleasant sight to behold the impudent Professor Hans Delbrück,
      whom we have already mentioned, poking fun at these crack-brained
      distorters of Marxism: &quot;The difference between us social-politically
      thinking persons, and you, is only a difference of degree. You have only
      to take a few steps more on the path you have begun, gentlemen, and
      your Marxian nebula will soon be dissipated&quot; (Hans Delbrück;
      <I>op. cit</I>., p.172).</FONT></P>
    
    <H4><a name="h"></a>h. Class, Party, Leaders</H4>
    
    <P>A class is a group of persons connected by reason of their common
      situation in production, and therefore also by their common situation in
      distribution, in other words, by common interests l (class interests). But
      it would be absurd to suppose that every class is a thoroughly unified
      whole, all parts being of equal importance, with Tom, Dick, and Harry all
      on the same level. In the modern working class, for instance, there is no
      doubt much inequality in brain-power and ability. Even the &quot;being&quot;
      of the various parts of the working class is unequal. This is due to the
      fact that, first, complete uniformity of the economic units is absent, and
      second, the working class does not step down full-grown from heaven, but
      is being constantly recruited, from the peasantry, the artisan class, the
      urban petty bourgeoisie, <I>i.e., </I>from other groups of capitalist
      society.</P>
    
    <P>A worker in a huge, splendidly equipped plant is a different person from
      the worker in a small shop, the cause of the difference in this case being
      the difference in the establishments, as well as between the entire
      resulting modes of work. Proletarian &quot;age&quot; must also be
      considered as an element, for a peasant who has just taken a job in a
      factory is different from a worker who has been in a factory since
      childhood.</P>
    
    <P>The difference in &quot;being&quot; is also reflected in consciousness.
      The proletariat is <I>unequal </I>in its consciousness as it is unequal
      in its position. It is <I>more or less </I>a unit as compared with the
      other classes, but not with regard to its own various parts.</P>
    
    <P>The working class, therefore, <I>as to their class consciousness, i.e.,
      </I>their permanent, general, not their personal, not their guild or group
      interests, but as to the interests of the <I>class as a whole, is </I>
      divided into <I>a number of groups and sub-groups, as a single chain
      consists of a number of links of varying strength</I>.</P>
    
    <P>This <I>inequality of the class is </I>the reason for the existence of
      the party. If the working class were perfectly and absolutely uniform, it
      could at any moment come out in its full strength; its struggles might be
      led by persons chosen <I>in rotation; </I>a permanent organization of
      leadership would be superfluous and unnecessary. As a matter of actual
      fact, the struggle of the working class is inevitable; this struggle must
      be guided; this guidance is the more necessary, since the opponent is
      powerful and cunning, and fighting him is a serious matter. We naturally
      expect to find the entire class led by that section of it that is most
      advanced, best schooled, most united: the <I>party</I>.</P>
    
    <P>The party is not the class; in fact, it may be but a small part of the
      class, as the head is but a small part of the body. But it would be absurd
      to attempt to find an opposition between the party and the class. The
      party is simply the thing that best expresses the interests of the class.
      We may<I> distinguish </I>between class and party, as we distinguish
      between the head and the entire body, but cannot discuss <I>them as
      opposites, </I>just as we cannot cut off a man's head, unless we wish
      to shorten his life.</P>
    
    <P>On what does the result of the struggle depend under these conditions?
      It depends on a proper relation between the various parts of the working
      class, particularly on a proper mutual relation between those in the party
      and those outside of it. On the one hand guidance and leadership are
      necessary; on the other, instruction and conviction. No leadership is
      possible which does not instruct and convince. On the one hand, the party
      must be held together and organized separately as a <I>part </I>of the
      class, on the other hand, it must secure closer and closer contact with
      the non-party masses and draw a greater and greater section of these`
      masses into its organization. The mental growth of the class will
      therefore find its expression in the growth of the party of this class,
      and, conversely, the decline of the class will be reflected in the decline
      of the party, or the decline of its influence on the non-party elements.</P>
    
    <P>We have already seen that the lack of uniformity within the; class makes
      necessary the existence of the <I>party </I>of this class. But the
      capitalist conditions of &quot;being&quot; and the low cultural level not
      only of the working class, but of the other classes also, produce a
      situation in which even the <I>vanguard </I>of the proletariat, <I>i.e.,
      </I>its party, also lacks internal uniformity. The party is more or less
      uniform as compared with the <I>other </I>sections of the working class,
      but not within itself. The same observations may here be made as in the
      case of the class. Let us assume - as we did before - that the party is
      entirely uniform in class-consciousness, experience, executive ability,
      etc., which is the complete reverse of the truth. Leaders would be
      unnecessary; the functions of the &quot;leaders&quot; might be performed
      in rotation by all the members, without detriment to the cause.</P>
    
    <P>But in reality no such perfect uniformity exists even in the vanguard,
      and this makes necessary the formation of more or less stable groups of
      individual &quot;leaders&quot;. Good leaders are leaders because they best
      express the proper tendencies of the party. And as it is absurd to
      represent party and class as opposed to each other, so it is absurd to
      represent the party as opposed to its leaders. To be sure, we have done
      this, when we opposed the working class to the Social-Democratic leaders,
      or the masses of organized workers to their leaders. But we did this - and
      still do it - in order to <I>destroy </I>the Social-Democracy, to <I>destroy
      </I>the influence of the bourgeoisie, operating through these <I>social-traitor
      </I>leaders. But it would be absurd to attempt to transfer these methods
      for the destruction of a hostile organization to ourselves, and represent
      this process as an expression of our peculiar form of revolution. The same
      situation may also be found in other classes; when, in modern
      England, the bourgeoisie ruled through party of Lloyd George, Lloyd
      George's party was ruling through the persons of its leaders.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The above will show the absurdity, among other things,
      of all the criticisms raised against the dictatorship of the Bolshevik
      Party in Russia, a dictatorship which is represented by the enemies of the
      revolution as <I>opposed to </I>the dictatorship of the working class. It
      is clear from the above that the class must necessarily rule through its
      head, <I>i.e., </I>the party; it can rule in no other way. And if its
      head, <I>i.e., </I>the party, is destroyed, the class itself and the
      class <I>in itself, is </I>also destroyed, being transformed from a
      conscious and independent social force into a simple factor of production
      and nothing more.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Herr Heinrich Cunow regards the matter differently. &quot;A
      party .does not ask him who wishes to join it: Do you belong to a certain
      class? Not even the Social-Democratic party. He who accepts the party's
      principles, demands, and its platform, in all essentials, may become a
      member. This platform not only includes certain economic planks (interest
      demands), <I>but also, </I>like the platforms of other parties, certain
      <I>political and philosophical views lying outside the economic sphere of
      interests </I>(concluding italics are mine, <I>N.B</I>.). To be sure, the
      basis of most parties is a certain class grouping; but in its structure
      each party is simultaneously an ideological formation, the representative
      of <I>a specific political thought-complex, </I>and many persons join a
      party not because they have the same special class demands as the party,
      but because they are attracted by &quot; this thought-complex.&quot; (<I>Die
      Marx'sche Geschichts-, Gesellschafts- und Staatstheorie, </I>Berlin, 1921,
      vol. ii, p.68. ) These observations by the now head-theoretician of the
      Social-Democracy are extremely instructive. Herr Cunow gaily opposes the
      political and philosophical conceptions in the party platform to the <I>economic
      demands </I>of this platform. But how could you, Citizen Cunow! What has
      become of your Marxism? The platform is the highest expression of the <I>consciousness
      </I>in all the &quot;thought-complexes&quot;. The &quot;political and
      philosophical conceptions&quot; are not made of whole cloth but grow up
      from the life conditions of these classes. They are not only not opposed
      to these life conditions, but, on the contrary, are their expression, and
      insofar as we are discussing the demands of the platform, it is obvious
      that the philosophical and political portion of this platform serves as
      the envelope for its economic portion.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">We may observe this fact even in Herr Cunow's party,
      the German Social-Democracy. Absorbing more and more non-workers, receding
      further and further from the working class, by supporting chiefly the
      aristocracy of skilled labor in that class, the German Social-Democracy
      has also changed the mental-political thought-complex of its &quot;platform&quot;,
      which has become much more moderate in its demands; in its ideology, it
      therefore favors the well - groomed-pardon the word - castrated &quot;Marxism&quot;
      of Herr Cunow, chooses Herr Bernstein an old betrayer of Marxism) as
      interpreter of its program, and makes Herr Vorländer (an idealist
      Kantian) its official philosopher.</FONT></P>
    
    <H4><a name="i"></a>i. The Classes as an Instrument of Social Transformation</H4>
    
    <P>If we consider society as a certain system developing objectively, we
      find that transitions from one class system (from one &quot;social
      formation of classes&quot;) to another is accomplished through a bitter
      <I>class </I>struggle. In this objective process of social changes the
      classes constitute the basic apparatus of transmission for reshaping the
      entire body of the living conditions of society. The structure of society
      changes <I>through </I>men and not outside of men; the production
      relations are as much a product of human struggle and of human activity as
      are flax or linen (Marx). But if we seek among; the countless individual
      wills running in all directions, but ultimately yielding a certain social
      resultant, to find the basic tendency, we shall obtain certain uniform &quot;bundles
      of wills&quot;: &quot;the class wills&quot;. These are most sharply
      differentiated in revolution, <I>i.e.,</I> in an upheaval of society
      during a transition from one class form to another.</P>
    
    <P>But hidden behind the law of cause and effect in the evolution of the
      class will and the various permutations and combinations in the clash of
      the opposed class wills - differing from each other - is the profounder
      causality of the objective evolution, a causality that determines the
      phenomena of the will at every stage in evolution.</P>
    
    <P>Furthermore, the phenomena of the will are <I>limited </I>by external
      conditions, <I>i.e., </I>each alteration in these conditions, proceeding
      under the reverse influence of the human will, is limited by the preceding
      stage in these conditions. Thus, the class struggle and the class will
      constitute an active transmission apparatus in the transition from one
      social structure to another.</P>
    
    <P>The new class, in this process, serves as the organizer and bearer of
      the new social and economic order. A class which is not the bearer of a
      new mode of production cannot &quot;transform&quot; society. On the
      contrary, the class power which embodies the growing and ever advancing
      conditions of production, is also the fundamental living lever of social
      transformation. Thus, the bourgeoisie, when it was the bearer of new
      conditions of production and a new economic structure, shunted society
      from its old feudal track to that of bourgeois evolution; similarly, the
      proletariat, the bearer and organizer of the socialistic class formulation
      will shift society - no longer capable of living on the basis - from the
      bourgeois track to that of socialism.</P>
    
    <H4><a name="j"></a>j. The Classless Society of the Future</H4>
    
    <P>Here we encounter a question that has been but little discussed in
      Marxian literature. We have seen that the class rules through the party,
      the party through its leaders; each class and each party therefore having
      its staff of officers. This staff is technically necessary, for we have
      seen that it is the result of the lack of uniformity within the class and
      the inequality of the party members, Each class therefore has its
      organizers. Viewing the evolution of society from this point of view, we
      may reasonably ask the following question. Is - in general - the communist
      classless society, of which Marxists speak, a possibility?</P>
    
    <P>It is. We know that the classes themselves have risen organically as
      Engels described, from the division of labor, from the organizational
      functions that had become technically necessary for the further evolution
      of society. Obviously, in the society of the future, such organizational
      work will also be necessary. One might object that the society of the
      future will not involve private property, or the formation of such private
      property, and it is precisely this private property that constitutes this
      basis of the class.</P>
    
    <P>But this argument need not remain unanswered. Professor Robert Michels,
      in his very interesting book, <I>Zur Soziologie des Parteiwesens in der
      modernen Demokratie </I>(Leipzig 1910, p.370) says: &quot;Doubts again
      arise on this point, however, whose consistent application would lead to
      an outright denial of the possibility of a classless state (the author
      should not have said `state' but `society' - <I>N.B</I>.) Their
      administration of boundless capital (<I>i.e., </I>means of production -
      <I>N.B</I>.) assigns at least as much power to the administrators as
      would possession of their own private property. &quot; Viewed from this
      point of view, the entire evolution of society seems to be nothing more
      than a substitution of one group of leaders for another. Accordingly,
      Vilfredo Pareto speaks of a &quot;theory of the circulation of élites&quot;
      (<I>théorie de la circulation des élites</I>). If this view
      is a correct one, Michels must also be correct in his conclusion, i.e.,
      socialists may be victorious, but not socialism. An example will show
      Michels' error. When the bourgeoisie is in power, it is by reason of the
      power - as we know - not of all the members of the class, but of its
      leaders. Yet it is evident that this condition does not result in a class
      stratification <I>within </I>the bourgeoisie. The landlords in Russia
      ruled their high officials, constituting an entire staff, an entire
      stratum, but this stratum did not set itself up as a class against the
      other landlords. The reason was that these other landlords did not have a
      lower standard of living than that of the former; furthermore, their
      cultural level was about the same, on the whole, and the rulers were
      constantly recruited from this class.</P>
    
    <P>Engels was therefore right when he said that the classes up to a certain
      moment are an outgrowth of the insufficient evolution of the productive
      forces; administration is necessary, but there is not sufficient bread for
      all, so to speak. Parallel with the growth, of the socially necessary
      organizational functions, we therefore have also a growth of private
      property. But communist society' is a society with highly developed,
      increased productive forces. Consequently, it can have no economic basis
      for the creation of its peculiar ruling class. For - even assuming the
      power of the administrators to be stable, as does Michels - this power
      will be then power of specialists over machines, not over men. How could
      they, in fact, realize this power with regard to men? Michels neglects the
      fundamental decisive fact that each administratively dominant position has
      hitherto been an envelope for economic exploitation. This economic
      exploitation may not be subdivided. But there will not even exist a
      stable, close corporation, dominating the machines, for the fundamental
      basis for the formation of monopoly groups will disappear; what
      constitutes an eternal category in Michels presentation, namely, the &quot;incompetence
      of the masses&quot; will disappear, for this incompetence is by no means a
      necessary attribute of every system; it likewise is a product of the
      economic and technical conditions, expressing themselves in the general
      cultural being and in the educational conditions. We may state that in the
      society of the future there will be a colossal overproduction of
      organizers, which will nullify the <I>stability </I>of the ruling groups.</P>
    
    <P>But the question of the <I>transition period </I>from capitalism to
      socialism, i.e., the period of the proletarian dictatorship, is far more
      difficult. The working class achieves victory, although it is not and
      cannot be a unified mass. It attains victory while the productive forces
      are going down and the great masses are materially insecure. There will
      inevitably result a <I>tendency </I>to &quot;degeneration&quot;, <I>i.e</I>.,
      the excretion of a leading stratum in the form of a class-germ. This
      tendency will be retarded by two opposing tendencies; first, by the <I>growth
      of the productive forces</I>; second, by the abolition of the <I>educational
      monopoly</I>. The increasing production of technologists and of organizers
      in general, out of the working class itself, will undermine this
      possible new class alignment. The outcome of the struggle will depend on
      which tendencies turn out to be the stronger.</P>
    
    <P>The working class, having in its possession so fine an instrument as the
      Marxian theory, must be mindful of this fact: by its hands an order of
      society will be put through and ultimately established, differing in
      principle from all the preceding formations; namely, from the primitive
      communist horde by the fact that it will be a society of highly cultivated
      persons, conscious of themselves and others; and from the class forms of
      society by the fact that for he first time the conditions for a human
      existence will be realized, not only for individual groups, but for the
      entire aggregate of humanity, a mass which will have ceased to be a mass,
      and will become a single, harmoniously constructed human society.</P>
