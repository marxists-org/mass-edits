    <H4>a. The Question of Freedom or Lack of Freedom of the Individual</H4>
    
    <P>WE have seen that in social life as well as in the life of nature there
      is a certain regularity of law, yet one may have doubts on this point. As
      a matter of fact, social phenomena are created by persons. Society
      consists of persons who think, cogitate, feel, pursue purposes, act. One
      does one thing; another for example, may do the same thing; a third,
      another thing; etc. The result of all these actions is a social
      phenomenon. Without people there would be no society, there would be no
      social phenomena. If social phenomena follow a uniform law and if they are
      nevertheless the result of the actions of men, it follows that the actions
      of each individual also depend on something. It thus follows that man and
      his will are not free, but bound, being subject also to certain laws. If
      this were not the case, if each man and his will did not depend on
      anything, where would we get any regularity in social phenomena? There
      would be no such thing. This is clear to everyone. If everybody were lame,
      it follows that the whole of society would be a society of lame persons:
      there would be nothing with which to form a society of my other kind.</P>
    
    <P>But, on the other hand, what is this question of the dependence of human
      will? Does not man himself decide what he wishes to do? I decided to drink
      water, and I am drinking water; I decided then go to the meeting, and I
      made up my mind to go. On a free evening, my comrades proposed that we go
      to the Proletkult Theatre, while others wanted to go to the Comedy
      Theatre; I decided to go to the Proletkult; I myself decided it. Has not
      man therefore the freedom of <I>choice? </I>Is he not free in his
      actions, in his wishes, in his desires, his aspirations? Is he a puppet, a
      mere chessman moved by forces outside of himself? Does not every man know
      from his own experience that he may freely resolve, choose, act?</P>
    
    <P>This question is called in philosophy the question of freedom or of
      freedom of the human will. The doctrine which maintains that the human
      will is free (independent) is called <I>indeterminism </I>(the doctrine
      of the unconditioned, independent will). The doctrine which maintains that
      the human will is dependent, conditioned, unfree, is called <I>determinism
      </I>(the doctrine of the dependence or conditioning of the will). We must
      therefore decide which of these two points of view is the correct one.</P>
    
    <P>First of all let us consider to what the doctrine of indeterminism would
      lead us if we should pursue it to its logical conclusion. If the human
      will is free and depends on nothing at all, this would mean that it is
      without cause. But this being the case, what would be the result? The
      result would be the good Old Testament religious theory. As a matter of
      fact we should then have the following condition: Everything in the world
      is accomplished according to certain laws. Everything, from the
      multiplication of fleas to the motions of the solar system has its causes;
      only the human will is not subject to this rule. It constitutes the sole
      exception. Here man is already no longer a part of nature, he is a sort of
      god standing above the world. Consequently the doctrine of freedom of the
      will leads straight to religion, which explains nothing, for in religion
      there is no knowledge but only blind belief in the practices of the devil,
      in the mysterious, in the supernatural, in bugbears of all kinds.</P>
    
    <P>Of course this is unreasonable. In order to crack this little nut, we
      must dwell on this point for a bit. Often - almost always - there is a
      confusion between the <I>feeling </I>of independence, and <I>real
      objective </I>independence. Let us take an example. Let us suppose that at
      a meeting you are looking at the speaker. He takes a glass of water from
      the table and empties it thirstily. What does he feel when he reaches for
      the glass? He is fully conscious of his freedom. He <I>himself </I>has
      decided that he should drink the water and not - let us say - dance a jig.
      He <I>feels </I>his freedom. But does this mean that he is really acting
      without cause, and that his will is truly independent? By no means. Every
      sensible man will at once recognize the nature of the case. He will say: &quot;The
      speaker's throat is dry.&quot; What does this mean? Simply, that the
      exertion of speaking has brought about such changes in the speaker's
      throat as to call forth in him a desire to drink water. That is the cause.
      An alteration in his organism (physiological cause) has brought about a
      certain desire. It therefore follows that we must not confuse a sense of
      freedom of the will, the <I>feeling </I>of independence, with
      causelessness, with an independence of human desires and actions. These
      are two entirely different things. And yet, the confusion of these two
      things is very frequent in all the reasonings of the indeterminists, who
      wish at any price to rescue the special &quot;divinity&quot; of the human
      spirit.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">One of the greatest philosophers, Baruch Spinoza
      (1632-1677) wrote concerning most of these philosophers: &quot;They
      obviously think of man in nature as of a state within the state, for they
      believe that man disturbs nature more than he complies with it; and that
      he has unconditional power over his actions, being determined from within
      himself and not from elsewhere.&quot; <I>(Ethics, </I>German translation
      by Otto Baensch, Leipzig, 1919, p.98). This erroneous conception arises
      only because men are not yet conscious of the external causes of their own
      actions. &quot;Thus, a child believes it desires milk of its own volition,
      likewise, the angry boy believes he desires revenge, voluntarily, while
      the timid man believes he voluntarily desires to flee&quot; (<I>ibid</I>.,
      p.105). Leibnitz (1646-1716) likewise speaks of men as losing sight of the
      causes of their actions <I>(causas . . . fugientes), </I>which gives them
      the illusion of absolute freedom; he mentions the example of the magnetic
      needle, which, if it were able to think, would surely rejoice (<I>laetaretur</I>)
      in its constantly pointing to the north pole (G. G. Leibnitz <I>Opera
      omnia, </I>Tomus I, Genevae, 1768, p.155 ).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The thought was expressed by D. Merezhkovsky, before he
      was attacked by his apocalyptic anti-bolshevik insanity</FONT><BR>
       </P>

       For of my own free will<BR>
       Upon the thirsting fields below<BR>
       Swiftly I fall.&quot;</FONT></P>
    
    <P>At bottom, people completely contradict in their actions the theory of
      the freedom of the will. For, if the human will were entirely independent
      of everything, it would be impossible to act at all, since there would be
      no possibility of reckoning or of predicting. Let us suppose that a
      speculator is going to the market. He knows there will be trading and
      haggling there, that each seller will ask too much, and that the
      purchasers will attempt to obtain lower prices, etc. But he does not
      expect that people will be walking about on all fours in the market, like
      cats, because it is contrary their nature. What does that mean? Simply,
      that their organism is constituted in a certain way. But do not clowns go
      about on all fours? Yes, for the reason that their will is determined
      other conditions, and when the speculator goes to the circus he expects
      that people will go about on all fours, at the circus, &quot;contrary to
      nature&quot;. Why do the buyers wish to buy cheap? For the simple reason
      that they are buyers. Their position as buyers &quot;obliges&quot; them to
      secure cheap goods; their wish, their will, their action is determined in
      this direction. But suppose this man is a seller? He will then act in the
      contrary direction. He will seek to sell as high as possible. It follows,
      in consequence, that the will is not at all independent, that it is
      determined by a number of causes, and that persons could not act at all if
      this were not the case.</P>
    
    <P>Let us now approach the subject from another standpoint. Everyone knows
      that a drunken man will develop &quot;stupid&quot; desires and that he
      will perform &quot;stupid&quot; actions. His will acts in a different
      manner from that of the sober man; the reason is to be found in alcoholic
      poisoning. Simply introduce a certain quantity of alcohol into the human
      organism, and the &quot;divine will&quot; begins to indulge in pranks that
      will surprise the saints. The reason is obvious. Or, let us take another
      example; feed salt to a man; he will necessarily begin &quot;freely&quot;
      to desire to drink much more than usual; the cause is quite obvious And
      suppose we feed the man &quot;normally&quot;? He will then drink a &quot;normal&quot;
      quantity of water; he will &quot;feel like&quot; drinking as any other man
      would &quot;feel like&quot; drinking. In other words, in this case also,
      the will is precisely as dependent as in the unusual cases.</P>
    
    <P>Man will fall in love when his organism has developed to that point. Man
      in a condition of extreme exhaustion surrenders to &quot;black despair&quot;.
      In a word, man's feeling and will are dependent on the condition of his
      organism and on the circumstances in which on he finds himself. His will,
      like all the rest of nature, is conditioned by certain causes, and man
      does not constitute an exception to all the rest of the world: whether he
      desire to scratch his ear, or accomplish heroic deeds, all his actions
      have their causes. To be sure, in some cases these causes are very
      difficult to ascertain. But that is another matter. We have by no means
      succeeded in ascertaining all the causes in the domain of inanimate
      nature. But this does not mean that these things cannot be explained at
      all. We must bear in mind that, as we have seen, not only the &quot;normal&quot;
      cases are subject to the law of cause and effect. All phenomena are
      subject to this law. The mental diseases may serve as the clearest
      example. Is it possible that the incoherent, stupid, strange and peculiar
      desires and actions of the mentally deranged, the insan, can have any law
      of cause and effect, any &quot;order&quot;? Even these have their causes.
      Under the influence of certain causes the insane behave in a certain way;
      under certain other influences, they will behave in another way, under a
      third set of causes, in still another way; etc. In other words, even in
      the case of the insane, law of cause and effect remains in full force.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This is the basis of the classification of mental
      diseases, all of which play be traced back along certain lines: 1.
      Heredity (syphilis, tuberculosis, etc.); 2. Lesions (traumata); 3.
      Intoxications (poisons); 4. Various destructive influences and commotions
      (cf. &quot;Mental Diseases&quot; in Granat's Russian Encyclopedia). For
      example, the dementia of dipsomania is described as follows: &quot;The
      patients believe that evil things are planned against them, that all those
      around them are in a plot, not only neighbors, but even domestic animals
      and inanimate objects&quot; etc. (A. Bernstein, same article).
      Dipsomania is a result of alcoholic intoxication. In progressive paralysis
      (due to syphilis) we have different &quot;symptoms&quot;: <I>first stage,
      </I>mental disturbance, levity, coarse actions, credulity; <I>second
      stage, </I>hallucinations (ideas of grandeur; the patient becomes a
      millionaire, a king, etc.); <I>third stage</I>, general collapse (P.
      Rosenbach: &quot;Progressive Paralysis,&quot; in Brockhaus Russian
      Encyclopedia, vol. 49). In the case of certain lesions diseased condition
      of certain portions of the brain or nervous system), the will is
      determined in certain directions; in other lesions, in other directions,
      etc. The entire practice of medicine in nervous diseases is based on the
      dependence of the mental life on certain causes.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>We have purposely chosen examples of the most varied kind. A
      consideration of these examples has shown that under all conditions, both
      usual and unusual, both normal and abnormal, the will, the feeling, the
      actions, of the individual man always have a definite cause; they are
      always conditioned (&quot;determined&quot;), defined. The doctrine of
      freedom of the will (indeterminism) is at bottom an attenuated form of a
      semi-religious view which explains nothing at all, contradicts all the
      facts of life, and constitutes an obstacle to scientific development. The
      only correct point of view is that of determinism.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="b"></A></P>
    
    <H4>b. The Resultant of the Individual Wills in Unorganized Society</H4>
    
    <P>There is no doubt that society consists of individual persons, and that
      a social phenomenon is composed of a numerous aggregation of individual
      feelings, moods, wills, actions. A social phenomenon is, in other words,
      the result (or, as is sometimes said, the &quot;resultant&quot;, the sum
      total) of the individual phenomena. Prices are an excellent example.
      Buyers and sellers go to market. The sellers have the goods, the buyers
      have the money. Each of the sellers and buyers is aiming at a certain
      object: each of them makes a certain estimate of goods and money, ponders,
      calculates, scratches and bites. The result of all this commotion in the
      market is the market price. This price may not represent the idea of any
      individual buyer or seller; it is a social phenomenon arising as a result
      of a struggle of the various wills. The same phenomenon as in price-fixing
      is also observable in all other social relations. Let us take, for
      example, the epoch of the revolution Some persons proceed more
      energetically, others less so; some are pushing in one direction; others
      in another. From this struggle <I>between persons </I>there finally,
      after the &quot;victory of the revolution&quot;, arises a new social
      structure, a new order of things. A certain order of social relations,
      wrote Marx, &quot;is as much a product of human beings as is canvas,
      linen, etc.&quot; (Karl Marx: <I>The Poverty of Philosophy, </I>French
      edition, Giard and Brière, 1908, page 155).</P>
    
    <P>We may consider in this connection two different cases, each of which
      has peculiarities of its own. These two cases are: that of unorganized
      society, or a simple commodities or capitalistic society; and that of
      organized communist society. In the former case, let us take the extremely
      typical example mentioned above, namely the example of price fixing. What
      will be the <I>relation of the price </I>which is fixed on the market,
      <I>with the desires, </I>with the estimates and intentions which were
      present in the mind of each individual who came to market? It is obvious
      that the price will not coincide with these wishes. For many persons this
      price will be outright ruinous; namely, for those who simply cannot buy
      anything &quot;at such prices,&quot; and who leave the spot, their pennies
      in their pockets and their stomachs empty; also for those who are <I>wiped
      out </I>by the, fact that the price is too low for them. Everyone knows
      that a great number of tradesmen, petty merchants and petty peasants are
      destroyed by the fact that the great factory owners flood the market with
      their cheap wares, which ruin the petty trader, unable to maintain the
      struggle, unable to meet prices at the low points to which they may go,
      when depressed under the weight of the great mass of goods thrown on the
      market by the great capitalists.</P>
    
    <P>We mentioned above another characteristic example, the example of the
      imperialist war, in which many capitalists in the various countries
      desired to make seizures, with great resulting impoverishment; from this
      impoverishment was born the revolution against the capitalists; although,
      of course, these capitalists had not desired such a revolution at all.</P>
    
    <P>What does this mean? It means that an unorganized society, where there
      is no planful production where classes are fighting each other, where
      nothing is done according to plan, but in an elemental natural manner, the
      result obtained (social phenomenon) does not coincide with the wishes of
      many persons. Or, as Marx and Engels frequently said, social phenomena are
      independent of the consciousness, the feeling and the will of individuals.
      This &quot;independence of the will of persons&quot; consists not in the
      fact that the events of social life proceed outside of the persons
      concerned, but in the fact that in unorganized society, in chaotic,
      elemental evolution, the social product of this will (or wills) does not
      coincide with the objects that are proposed by many persons, but sometimes
      is in direct contradiction with these objects (a man wishing to make
      profit finds himself ruined).</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">A great many objections against Marxism are based on
      the misunderstanding of the phrase &quot;independence of the will&quot;,
      as used by Marx and Engels. A few lines from Engels will be in place here:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">&quot;Nothing appears without an intentional purpose,
      without an end desired . . . . That which is willed but rarely happens. In
      the majority of cases the desired ends cross and interfere with each
      other. So, the innumerable conflicts of individual wills and
      individual agents in the realm of history reach a conclusion which is on
      the whole analogous to that in the realm of nature, which is without
      definite purpose. The ends of the actions are intended, but the results
      which follow from the actions are not intended, or in so far as they
      appear to correspond with the end desired, in their final results are
      quite different from the conclusion wished&quot;<I> (Feuerbach, </I>translated
      by Austin Lewis, Chicago 1906, pp.104, 105)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">&quot;Men make their own history, in that each follows
      his own desired ends independent of results, and the results of these many
      wills acting in different directions and their manifold effects upon the
      world constitute history . . . . But ... we have seen in history that the
      results of many individual wills produce effects, for the most part quite
      other than what is wished - often, in fact, the very opposite&quot; (<I>Feuerbach,</I>
      p.105, 106).</FONT></P>
    
    <P>From the above it follows that in unorganized society, as well as in any
      other society, events are accomplished not outside of the will of the
      individuals, but through this will. In this case the individual man is
      subject to an unconscious natural process which is the product of the
      individual wills.</P>
    
    <P>Let us now turn our attention to another circumstance. Once a certain
      social result of the individual wills has been obtained, this social
      result determines the conduct of the individual. We must emphasize this
      point, for it is very important.</P>
    
    <P>Let us begin with the example that has already been mentioned twice,
      namely, that of price fixing. Let us assume that a pound of carrots costs
      so much on the market. It is obvious that both the new purchasers and the
      new sellers already have had this price in mind in advance, that they have
      already been approximately assuming this price in their reckonings. In
      other words, the social phenomenon (price) has a determining influence on
      the individual phenomena (offers and demands). The same thing takes place
      in all the other phases of life. The incipient painter bases his activity
      on all the preceding evolution of his art and on the social feelings and
      social tendencies with which he is surrounded. On what are the actions of
      the statesman based? On the circumstances under which he acts: he may
      desire either to strengthen a certain order or destroy it. This will
      depend in turn on the side on which he stands, on the environment in which
      he lives, on the social class and on the social aspirations from which he
      draws his strength. In other words, his will also is determined by social
      conditions.</P>
    
    <P>We have seen above that in unorganized society the final consequence
      very often is different - sometimes quite different - from the original
      desires of the persons involved. It may here be said that the &quot;social
      product&quot; (social phenomenon) <I>dominates </I>the persons. And this,
      not only in the sense that it determines the conducts of these persons,
      but even in the sense that it directly contradicts their desires. Thus, in
      <I>unorganized </I>society we may set up the following laws</P>
    
    <P>1<I>. Social phenomena are the resultant of the conflict of individual
      wills, feelings, actions, etc.</I></P>
    
    <P>2. <I>Social phenomena determine at any given moment the will of the
      various individuals.</I></P>
    
    <P>3.<I> Social phenomena do not express the will of individual persons,
      but frequently are a direct contradiction of this will; they prevail over
      it by force, with the result that the individual often feels the pressure
      of social forces on his actions </I>(example: the ruined merchant, the
      capitalist, who has stood for war, is disestablished by the revolution,
      etc.).</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="c"></A></P>
    
    <H4>c. The Collectively Organized Will (the Resultant of Individual Wills
    in Organized Communist Society)</H4>
    
    <P>Let us now consider the state of affairs in organized society. In such a
      society there is no anarchy in production; there are no classes, no class
      struggles, no oppositions of class interests, etc. There are not even
      contradictions between personal and social interests. We are now dealing
      with a friendly brotherhood of workers with a common plan for production.</P>
    
    <P>What now is the situation of the individual will? Of course, society
      will continue to consist of persons, and social phenomena will continue to
      be the product of the individual wills. But the <I>character</I> of this
      aggregation, the <I>method </I>by which this resultant is obtained, are
      completely different from those obtaining in unorganized society. In order
      to grasp this difference clearly, let us take a little preliminary
      example. Let us suppose that we have a little society or circle of persons
      who have organized to sing together. All propose the same goal for
      themselves, propose to solve the questions involved, to evaluate the
      difficulties with which they are faced, in short, they make resolutions in
      common and carry them out in common. Their common action, their common
      resolution - these are already a collective &quot;product&quot;. But this
      product is not an external, crude, elemental force flying in the face of
      the individual desires; on the contrary, it constitutes an enhanced
      possibility of each individual's attaining his desire. Five men resolve to
      lift a stone together. Alone, none of them could lift it; together, they
      do so without difficulty. The general resolution does not differ by a
      hair's breadth from the desire of each individual. On the contrary, it
      aids in the realization of this desire.</P>
    
    <P>The case will be the same - but on a more magnificent scale, and in more
      intricate form - in communist society (by which we mean not the period of
      proletarian dictatorship, nor the first steps of communism, but the fully
      developed communist society in which there are no remnants of classes, no
      state, and no external legal norms). In such a society, all the relations
      between men will be obvious to each, and the social volition will be the
      <I>organization </I>of all their wills. It will not be a resultant
      obtained by elemental accident, &quot;independent&quot; of the will of the
      individual, but a consciously organized social decision. We therefore
      cannot have the same result as in capitalist society. Under communism, the
      &quot;social product&quot; will, not dominate over men, but men will
      control their own decisions, for the very reason that it is they who make
      the resolve, and who make it consciously. It will be impossible to observe
      social phenomena whose effect on the majority of the population will be
      harmful and ruinous.</P>
    
    <P>But it by no means follows from the above that in a communist society
      the social will and the will of the individual will be independent of
      everything, or that there will be freedom of the will under communism,
      with man suddenly becoming a supernatural creature who is not subject in
      any way to the law of cause and effect. Under communism, man will remain a
      portion of nature, subject to the general law of cause and effect. Will
      not each individual continue to depend on the circumstances surrounding
      him? He will; he will not act as a savage in Central Africa or as a banker
      belonging to the trading firm of J. Pierpont, Morgan and Company, or as a
      hussar in the period of the imperialist war. He will act as a member of
      the <I>communist </I>society. The circumstances of life will determine
      man's will. Everyone, for example, understands that it will be necessary
      for a communist society to struggle with nature, and consequently the
      conditions of this struggle will of themselves define the conduct of men,
      etc. In a word, the deterministic theory will remain in full force in
      communist society also.</P>
    
    <P>Therefore, we may set up the following laws in the case of <I>organized
      </I>society</P>
    
    <P>1<I> Social phenomena are the resultant of the conflict of individual
      wills, feelings, actions, etc. </I>But here this process does not proceed
      with elemental confusion, but - in the decisive instances - in an
      organized manner. </P>
    
    <P>2<I> Social phenomena determine at any given moment the will of the
      various individuals.</I></P>
    
    <P>3<I> Social phenomena are an expression of the will of men and usually
      do not fly in the face of this will; men control their own decisions and
      do not feel any pressure of blind social forces upon them, since these
      forces have been replaced by a national social organization.</I></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Engels wrote that humanity, in its transition to
      communism, makes a &quot;leap&quot; from the realm of necessity into the
      realm of freedom. Some bourgeois scholars inferred that Engels meant that
      determinism would lose its validity in communist society. This view is
      based on a crude distortion of Marxism. Engels meant - and rightly that in
      the communist society evolution would assume a consciously organized
      character, as opposed to the unconscious, blind, elemental stage. Men will
      know what they are doing and how they must operate under the given

    <H4>d. Accidentalism in General</H4>
    
    <P>In order to understand fully the general interdependence of phenomena,
      we must continue to dwell here on the discussion of so called &quot;accidentalism&quot;.
      As a matter of fact, we very frequently encounter accident in every-day
      life, as well as in social life. Certain scholars have even taken up
      special investigations of the rôle of accident in history&quot;. We
      very frequently speak of accident: persons &quot;chanced&quot; to be
      walking in the street; a brick, falling from the roof, killed a man; by
      chance I purchased an extremely rare book; accidentally, in a strange
      city, I met a man I had not seen for twenty years, etc. Further examples:
      playing &quot;heads or tails&quot;, or dice. By accident, &quot;heads&quot;
      came out: I won; by accident, it was &quot;tails&quot;: I lost. How shall
      we explain this accident in terms of natural law, or, in other words,
      where does <I>causal necessity</I> enter here?</P>
    
    <P>Let us examine this question. Let us first consider the case of &quot;heads&quot;
      and &quot;tails&quot;. Why, for example, should &quot;heads&quot; come out
      on top? Is it true that there were no reasons, no causes? There must have
      been causes. Heads came out on top, because, with a coin of given shape, I
      made certain motions with my hand, with a certain force, in a certain
      direction; result: the coin fell with a certain surface down, etc. If all
      these conditions should be repeated, inevitably &quot;heads&quot; would
      again appear. And if the experiment should be made a third time, the
      result would be the same. But the fact is that in tossing the coin, it is
      simply impossible to discount all the circumstances in advance. A slight
      inclination of the hand, a flip of a finger, a change of the force with
      which the coin is tossed, all these will influence the result. The causes
      leading to the result (obverse or reverse appearing on top) cannot there
      be calculated in practice. They exist, but we cannot reckon with them,
      because we do not know them. In this case we term our ignorance &quot;accident&quot;.</P>
    
    <P>Let us now take another example: my accidental meeting with an
      acquaintance whom I had not seen for twenty years. It is not difficult to
      see that there are causes for this meeting; impelled by certain causes I
      left at a certain time and went by a certain route a certain speed;
      impelled by another set of causes, my acquaintance at a certain time began
      his journey on a certain road, with a certain speed. It is quite evident
      that the combined action of all these causes necessarily brought about our
      meeting. Why should this meeting appear accidental to me? Why should it
      seem me that no causal necessity was present? For the very simple that I
      am ignorant of the causes governing my friend's that I am ignorant even of
      the fact that he is living in the same city, and consequently am unable to
      foresee our meeting.</P>
    
    <P><I>If, of two or more causal chains (series) of intersecting actions,
      we know only one, the phenomenon obtained by their intersection will
      appear accidental to us, though in reality it is in accordance with law.
      </I>I know one of the chains (one series) of causes, those resulting in my
      own passing through the street; of the other chain (series) of causes,
      those impelling my friend, I am ignorant. For this reason, this
      intersection strikes me as an &quot;accidental&quot; phenomenon. Strictly
      speaking, therefore, there are no accidental, <I>i.e., </I>causeless
      phenomena. But phenomena may impress us as &quot;accidental&quot; when
      their causes are insufficiently clear to us.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Spinoza already knew this: he states that &quot;a thing
      is called accidental merely through lack of inner understanding      because the series of causes is concealed from us&quot; <I>(Ethics, </I>translation
      by Baensch, Leipzig, 1919, p.<I>30). </I>John Stuart Mill, in his <I>System
      of Logic, </I>Book iii., chap. <I>xvii, </I>par. 2, after making a
      correct analysis, writes as follows: &quot;It is incorrect, then, to say
      that any phenomenon is produced by chance; but we may say that two or more
      phenomena are conjoined by chance, that they coexist or succeed one
      another only <I>by chance; </I>meaning that they are in no way related
      through causation; that they are neither cause and effect, nor effects of
      the same cause, nor effects of causes between which there subsists any law
      of coexistence, <I>nor even effects of the same original collocation of
      primeval causes.&quot; </I>We have italicized the incorrect statements.
      The fact is (in the example of my meeting a friend) that I did not leave
      my house because my friend had gone away, and my friend did not set out
      because I had gone away. But if there is given a certain &quot;distribution
      of causes&quot;, <I>i.e., </I>if we assume as given that I went away at a
      certain time, on a given path, with given speed, and if we assume the same
      details to be given in the case of my friend, we are in possession of the
      causes of our meeting; there is as little of accident and independence in
      this &quot;distribution of causes&quot; as in the case of eclipses of the
      sun or moon, which are determined by a certain situation (&quot;meeting&quot;)
      of celestial bodies.</FONT></P>

    <H4>e. Historical &quot;Accident&quot;'</H4>
    
    <P>After what has been said above, the question of so called &quot;historical
      accident&quot; is a relatively simple matter.</P>
    
    <P>If at bottom all things proceed in accordance with law, and if there is
      nothing that is accidental - causeless - it is clear there can be no
      such thing as accident in history. Each historical event, however
      accidental it may appear, is absolutely and completely conditioned by
      certain causes; historical accidentalism also simply means the
      intersection of certain causal series of which only one series is known.</P>
    
    <P>Sometimes, however, the term <I>historical accident is </I>used in
      another sense. For instance, when we say that the imperialist war was a<I>
      necessary </I>result of the evolution of world capitalism, we are also in
      the habit of adding that the murder of the Austrian Archduke was an <I>accidental
      </I>phenomenon; but here &quot;accident&quot; is something different. When
      we speak of the necessity (causal necessity, inevitability) of the
      imperialist war, we infer this inevitability from the immense power of
      certain causes in the evolution of society, causes leading to war.
      Similarly, the war in its turn is also an event of immense importance, an
      event exerting a decisive influence on the further destinies of society.
      Therefore, the expression &quot;historical accident&quot; as used here,
      signifies a circumstance that does not play an important part in the chain
      of social events: even if this &quot;accident&quot; had not come to pass,
      the subsequent evolution would have been altered so little as not to be
      essentially changed in any way. In the given case: the war would have come
      if the Archduke had not been killed, for the &quot;crux of the matter&quot;
      was not in this slaying, but in the sharpening of the between the
      imperialist powers, growing fiercer day by day with the evolution of
      capitalist society.</P>
    
    <P>May we say that such &quot;accidental&quot; phenomena play no part at
      all in social life, that they have no effect on the destinies of society,
      that they are equivalent to zero? A truly correct answer could deny the
      importance even of &quot;accidental&quot; events, for each event, &quot;insignificant&quot;
      though it may be, actually has an influence on all of subsequent history.</P>
    
    <P>The important point is the magnitude of the effect of such an event on
      the evolution of the future. When we speak of phenomena that are &quot;accidental&quot;
      in the sense above indicated, their practical influence is unimportant,
      insignificant, infinitely small. This influence may be infinitesimal, but
      it is not zero. We shall understand this if we consider the <I>combined
      </I>aggregate action of such &quot;accidental&quot; facts. For example:
      let us consider the fixing of prices. The market price is fixed by the
      conflict of a great mass of guesses on the part of buyers and sellers. If
      we consider a single case, a single price-estimate, the meeting of a
      single buyer and a single seller, such an instance may be considered &quot;accidental&quot;.
      Merchant John Brown fleeces old man Smith. This act, from the point of
      view of the <I>market-price, i.e., </I>of a <I>social</I> phenomenon,
      the resultant of a multitude of meetings between various estimates,
      accidental. What does it matter what happened to John Brown in any given
      case? What we want is the final result, the social phenomenon, the <I>typical
      </I>fact in the matter. We often hear such statements, and they are quite
      reasonable. For the individual case is of negligible importance. But just
      combine a great number of such &quot;accidents&quot;, and you will at once
      see that their &quot;accidental nature&quot; begins to disappear. The
      function and significance of many actions, their combined action, is at
      once felt in the sequel. So the individual cases are by no means zero
      quantities, for zero, however frequently multiplied, will never give more
      than zero.</P>
    
    <P>We therefore observe that, strictly speaking, there is no such thing as
      an accidental phenomenon in the historical evolution of society; the fact
      that Karl Kautsky could not sleep one night because he was dreaming of the
      terrors of the Bolshevik Revolution; the fact that the Austrian Archduke
      was killed shortly before the war; the fact that England was pursuing a
      colonial policy; the fact that the world war was brought about; in a word,
      <I>all </I>events, from the most petty and insignificant to the most
      epoch-making events of our times, are <I>equally not accidental, </I>are
      equally conditioned by causes, i.e., are equally the result of causal
      necessity.</P>

    <H4>f. Historical Necessity</H4>
    
    <P>It follows from the above that the conception of &quot;accident&quot;
      must also be banished from the social sciences. Society and its evolution
      are as much subject to natural law as is everything else in the universe.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Characteristically enough, the doctrine of accident,
      when it seriously admits accidentalism as a fact, leads directly into a
      faith in the supernatural, a faith in God. This is the basis of the so
      called &quot;cosmological proof&quot; of the existence of God; if the
      cosmos is not subject to the law of cause and effect, it is evident that
      there must be a special cause for its existence and evolution. This
      alleged reasoning is also designated as a &quot;proof of the accidental
      nature of the universe&quot; (<I>e contingentia mundi</I>), and may be
      found in Aristotle, Cicero, Leibnitz, Christian Wolff, etc. In the present
      period of decline and disintegration of bourgeois society, the doctrine of
      accident is again being widely accepted (for instance, by the French
      philosophers Boutroux, Bergson, etc.).</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The conception of accidentalism is directly opposed to that of necessity
      (causal necessity).</P>
    
    <P>&quot;A thing is necessary when it follows inevitably from certain
      causes.&quot; When we say that a certain phenomenon was a historical
      necessity, we mean that it necessarily had to follow, without regard to
      whether it would be good or bad. When we speak of causal necessity, we are
      not giving the slightest indication of our opinion of the event, of its
      desirability or undesirability; we are considering only its inevitability.
      But we must not - as is often done - conuse two entirely different
      conceptions: <I>necessity </I>in the sense of &quot;great desirability&quot;,
      and <I>causal necessity</I>. No two things could farther apart. And when
      we speak of historical necessity, we not mean &quot;desirability&quot;
      from the standpoint of - let us say - progress, but <I>the inevitable
      result </I>of the course of social evolution. In this sense, we may speak
      of the historical necessity of the rapid growth of the productive forces
      at the end of the Nineteenth Century, or of the disappearance of the so
      called Cretan civilization. <I>Necessary </I>means only: <I>conditioned
      by cause.</I></P>
    
    <P>We now are brought to a rather difficult question, still connected with
      this difficult matter of necessity.</P>
    
    <P>Let us suppose that we have before us a human society which has doubled
      in population in the course of twenty years. We may rightly infer that
      production has grown in this society. If it had not grown, the society
      could not have doubled its population. If this society has increased in
      numbers, production must also have increased. This example would not seem
      to require further explanation. But what does it involve? We are here
      seeking by a special method the <I>cause </I>of social growth, the cause
      that constitutes the necessary condition of this growth. If this condition
      is not present, there will be no growth; if there is a growth, <I>as a
      consequence, </I>this condition must also be present.</P>
    
    <P>This example might lead to conflicts of the following nature. At the
      beginning of this book we mercilessly cast out teleology. Now it looks as
      if we were ourselves restoring it: &quot;Drive nature out by the door, and
      she will fly in through the window.&quot; But does our formulation of this
      question permit this inference? For the growth of society, for the
      doubling of its numbers, it was necessary that production should increase.
      The growth and increase of society is the goal, the &quot;telos&quot;. The
      increase of production is the <I>means</I> for realizing this goal. The
      natural law of growth is therefore a teleological natural law. But this
      would be equivalent to a violation of scientific method, and to falling
      into the open arms of the priests</P>
    
    <P>As a matter of fact, we are dealing with an entirely different at all
      teleological in its nature. We are here proceeding from the assumption
      that society has grown (in a concrete case, we may proceed from the <I>fact
      </I>that society has grown). But then, society may <I>not </I>grow. And
      if it should <I>not </I>grow, but - let us say - should decrease by
      one-half, and if, furthermore, the decrease should be due to insufficient
      food, it is clear that production must have been curtailed. No man can be
      prevailed upon to behold &quot;purpose&quot; in the destruction of
      society. No one can be induced, in this case, to reason as follows: the
      goal is the decrease in the numbers of society by insufficient food; the
      means for realizing this goal is a curtailment of production. Here we
      cannot see teleology at all. We are simply seeking the condition (cause)
      leading to the result (effect). The necessary condition for further
      evolution is also frequently called <I>historical necessity. </I>In this
      sense of the term &quot;historical necessity&quot;, we may speak of the &quot;necessity&quot;
      of the French Revolution, without which capitalism could not have
      continued to grow; or of the &quot;necessity&quot; of the so called &quot;Liberation
      of the Serfs&quot; in Russia in 1861, without which Russian capitalism
      could not have developed. In this sense we may also speak of the
      historical necessity of socialism, since <I>without it </I>human society
      cannot continue to develop. If society is to continue to develop,
      socialism will inevitably come. This is the sense in which Marx and Engels
      speak of &quot;social necessity&quot;.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The method of finding the <I>necessary conditions </I>from
      the given or accepted facts was very often used by Marx and Engels,
      although but little attention has been given to their use of this method.
      The whole of <I>Capital </I>is built up on it. Given: a
      commodities-producing society with all its elements; how explain its
      existence? <I>Answer: </I>it can exist only under the condition that the
      law of value exists; countless commodities are exchanged against each
      other; how may we explain this? It is possible only if we assume the
      existence of a money system (social necessity of money). Capital is
      accumulated on the basis of the laws of commodities circulation. This is
      possible only because the value of the labor power is lower than that of
      the product turned out, etc.</FONT></P>

    <H4>g. Are the Social Sciences Possible? Is Prediction Possible in this
    Field?</H4>
    
    <P>From what has been said above it follows that prediction is possible in
      the domain of the social sciences as well as in that of the natural
      sciences. Such prediction is not of the kind practiced by the charlatan or
      faker, but is of scientific nature. We know, for example, that astronomers
      are able to predict with the utmost precision the time of an eclipse of
      the sun or moon; they can predict the appearance of comets or of great
      numbers of &quot;falling stars&quot;; meteorologists can predict the
      weather - sunshine, wind, storm rain. There is nothing mysterious about
      these predictions, as we may see from the example of the astronomer, who
      knows the laws of motion of the planets; the path followed by sun, moon,
      earth; and also, the velocities with which they move, and at what points
      they will be in their paths at a certain time. There is nothing miraculous
      in the fact that under these conditions it can be precisely calculated
      when the moon will come between the earth and the sun and hide the &quot;light
      of heaven&quot; from our sight. Now, let us ask whether there is anything
      similar to this in the social sciences; the answer is in the affirmative.
      If we know the laws of social growth, the paths along which society
      necessarily travels, the direction of this evolution, it will not be
      difficult for us to define the future society. In social science we have
      had many instances of such predictions which have been fully justified by
      the outcome. On the basis of our knowledge of the laws of social
      evolution, we predicted economic crises, the devaluation of paper money,
      the world war, the social revolution as a result of the war; we predicted
      the behavior of the various groups, classes and parties in the time of the
      Russian Revolution; we predicted, for example, that the
      Social-Revolutionists would be transformed, after the proletarian coup
      <I>d'etat, </I>into a counter-revolutionary party of rich peasants, of
      Whites, of lawless bands; long before the revolution, as early as the
      nineties of the last century, Russian Marxists were predicting the
      inevitable growth of capitalism in Russia and with it the inevitable
      growth of the workers' movement. We might give hundreds of examples of
      such predictions, in none of which is there anything miraculous, once we
      know the laws of the social-historical process.</P>
    
    <P>We cannot predict the <I>time </I>of the appearance of any such
      phenomenon, for we do not yet possess sufficient information regarding the
      laws of social evolution to be able to express them in, precise figures.
      We do not know the velocity of the social processes but we are already in
      a position to ascertain their <I>direction</I>.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Bulgakov, in his <I>Capitalism and Agriculture </I>(in
      Russian, 1900, vol. pp.457-458) says: &quot;Marx considered it possible to
      measure and predict the future in accordance with past and present,
      whereas each epoch furnishes new facts and new forces of historical
      evolution - the creative power of history never runs dry. Therefore,
      any prognosis with regard to the future, which is based on the results of
      the present, must necessarily (!!!) be in error. . . The veil of the
      future is impenetrable.&quot; The same author, in his <I>Philosophy of
      Economy </I>(in Russian, Moscow, 1972, p.272): &quot;But even much
      more modest predictions may be admitted, in the case of social science,
      only with a grain of salt. The `tendencies of evolution' determined by
      science and favorable to socialism, have very little in common with the
      `laws of natural science', that Marx takes them to be. They are merely
      `empirical' . . . they have an entirely different logical nature from that
      of the laws of mechanics.&quot; These quotations from Professor Bulgakov
      will serve as a very characteristic example of the &quot;refutation&quot;
      of Marxism; needless to say, they will not hold water. Bulgakov thinks
      that the laws of capitalist evolution, for example, are &quot;empirical
      laws&quot;. &quot;Empirical&quot; is the term given to such causal
      relations as have not yet been unraveled. For instance, it has been
      observed that more boys are born than girls, but the reasons for the
      phenomenon are unknown. Such &quot;laws&quot; are truly different in their
      &quot;logical nature&quot;. But this is not the case with the laws of
      evolution of socialism, which have a causal thread. The law of the
      centralization of capital, for instance, is not an &quot;empirical law&quot;,
      but a real law of natural science. If small production units are competing
      with large ones, the victory of the latter is inevitable. We know the
      causal connections; we may predict the victory of large-scale production
      in Japan or in Central Africa.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Our first quotation from Bulgakov is merely superficial literary drivel.
      History &quot;furnishes new facts&quot;, the creative power of history
      does not run dry, etc. But the evolution of nature also furnishes &quot;new
      facts&quot;; such new facts are not unknown to the natural sciences, or to
      mathematics, with their different &quot;logical nature&quot;. Bulgakov is
      right only in his statement that we never know everything, but that is no
      reason for inferring that science is an insufficient instrument.</P>
    
    <P>It is also quite characteristic that Bulgakov, in his <I>Philosophy of
      </I>Economy, dwells frequently and very seriously on angels, the lust of
      the flesh, man's fall from grace, Saint Sophia, etc. This stuff, to be
      sure, is of a &quot;different logical nature&quot;, one that much
      resembles the charlatanry and quackery attacked by Bulgakov.</P>
    
    <P>The theory of determinism in the field of social phenomena, and of the
      possibility of scientific prediction, has called forth a number of
      replies, of which we shall consider one, from the mouth of R. Stammler.
      Stammler asks the Marxists - who maintain that socialism must come with
      the same degree of certainty as does an eclipse of the sun - why the
      Marxists should attempt to <I>bring about </I>socialism in that case. One
      of two things is true, says Stammler, either socialism will come, like an
      eclipse of the sun, in which case there is no reason for effort, for
      struggle, for a party organization of the working class, etc.; for no one
      would think of organizing a party to support an eclipse of the sun; for,
      in organizing a party, in conducting the struggle, etc., you are admitting
      that it is possible that socialism may not come; but you <I>desire </I>it,
      and consequently are struggling for it.</P>
    
    <P>But such is not the nature of the necessity of socialism. It is easy, in
      view of our foregoing exposition, to detect Stammler's error. An eclipse
      of the sun does not depend either directly or `indirectly on human
      desires; in fact, it does not depend on <I>men </I>at all. All humans
      might die, without distinction of class, sex, nationality, and age, and
      yet the sun would be eclipsed at a certain moment. The case with social
      phenomena is entirely different, for they are accomplished <I>through
      </I>the will of men. Social phenomena <I>without </I>humans, without
      society, would be something like a round square or burning ice. Socialism
      will come inevitably because it is inevitable that men, definite classes
      of men, will stand for its realization, and they will do so under
      circumstances that will make their victory certain. Marxism does not <I>deny
      the will, but explains it. </I>When Marxists organize the Communist Party
      and lead it into battle, this action is also an expression of historical
      necessity, which finds its form precisely through the will and the r
      actions of men.</P>
    
    <P><I>Social determinism, i.e., </I>the doctrine that all social phenomena
      are conditioned, have causes from which they necessarily flow, must not be
      confused with <I>fatalism, </I>which is a belief in a blind, inevitable
      destiny, a &quot;fate&quot;, weighing down upon everything, and to which
      everything is subjected. Man's will is nothing. Man is not a quantity to
      be considered among causes; he is simply a passive substance. This
      teaching denies the human will as a factor in evolution, which determinism
      does not.</P>
    
    <P>This &quot;Fate&quot; is often embodied in godlike creatures, as the
      Moira of the ancient Greeks, the Parcae of the Romans; in a number of
      Fathers of the Church (for instance, Saint Augustine), the doctrine of
      pre-destination plays the same role; the Reformer Calvin illustrates the
      same phenomenon (cf. R. Wipper: <I>Church and State in Geneva in the
      Sixteenth Century, </I>in Russian); we have a particularly striking
      expression of fatalism in Islam. But we cannot help calling attention to
      this fatalistic tendency among the Social-Democrats. Precisely in that
      section of the Social-Democracy which has allied itself with the
      bourgeoisie, Marxism has degenerated into a fatalistic notion. Cunow,
      whose whole &quot;philosophy&quot; is expressed in the thesis that &quot;history
      is always right&quot;, and that therefore no one should oppose either the
      World War or imperialism, is the best example of this fatalistic
      distortion of Marxism. This distorted view would represent any communist
      uprising of the workers as a senseless effort to violate the laws of
      historical evolution from without, and not as an outcome of historical
      necessity.</P>
