    <H4>a. Concept of Aggregates; Logical and Real Aggregates</H4>
    
    <P>We encounter not only simple bodies, which at once impress us as
      constituting units (for example, a sheet of paper, a cow, John Smith), but
      also meet with compound units, intricate quantities. When considering the
      movement of the population, we may say the number of male infants born
      within a certain interval of time has increased so much. We then regard
      this &quot;number of male infants&quot; as a total quantity, existing
      apart from the various units, and considered as a unit in itself (a &quot;statistical
      aggregate&quot;). We also speak of a forest, a class, human society, and
      at once find that we are dealing with compound quantities: we regard these
      quantities as individual quantities, but we likewise know that these
      wholes consist of elements having a certain degree of independence the
      forest consists of trees, bushes, etc.; the class, of the various persons
      constituting it, etc. Such composite quantities are called aggregates.</P>
    
    <P>From the examples given above we may learn, however, that aggregates may
      be of various kinds: when we speak of the male infants born in a certain
      year, and when we speak of the town forest, it is clear that there is a
      difference between the two. In the one case, that of the male infants, we
      know that these individuals are not found together in life, in actual
      reality: one is in one place and another in another; none has any
      influence on another; each is for himself. It is <I>we </I>who are
      combining them when we add them up. It is <I>we </I>who make the
      aggregation: this is a mental aggregate, a paper aggregate, not a living
      or real aggregate. Such artificial aggregates may be called imaginary or
      logical aggregates. But when we speak of society, or of a forest, or of a
      class, the case is quite different; here the union of the component
      elements is not only a mental (logical) union. For we have before us the
      forest, with its trees, bushes, grass, etc., which surely constitutes an
      actual living whole. The forest is not merely a summation of its various
      elements. All these elements are continually interacting one upon the
      other, in other words, they are in a state of constant mutual interaction.
      Cut down some of the trees, and perhaps the others will wither by reason
      of the subsequent decrease in moisture, or perhaps they will grow better
      because they can get more sun. We are here clearly dealing with an
      interaction of the parts making up &quot;the forest&quot;, and the
      interaction here is a perfectly real one, existing in fact, not imagined
      by us for one purpose or another. Furthermore: this interaction is of long
      duration and constant, being present as long as the whole continues to
      exist. Such aggregates are called <I>real aggregates</I>.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">All these differences are conditional. Strictly
      speaking, there are no simple units. John Smith is in reality a whole
      colony of cells, i.e., he is a highly complicated body. We have seen that
      even the atom may be subdivided. And as (in principle) there are no limits
      of divisibility, so there are ultimately no uniform units. Nevertheless,
      our distinctions may hold within certain limits: an individual human is an
      individual body and not a totality, when compared with society; but he is
      a composite body, a real aggregate, when compared with the cell, etc. If
      we wish to speak in a non-comparative way, we make use of the term system.
      <I>System</I> and <I>real aggregate</I> are identical terms. The
      conditional nature of all these distinctions may be shown in another way
      also: strictly speaking, the entire universe is an infinite real
      aggregate, all the particles of which are in process of constant and
      uninterrupted interaction. We thus have an interaction between all the
      objects and elements of the universe, but this interaction is in some
      cases more or less direct, in some cases more or less indirect. Hence our
      distinctions, as made above; they hold good - as we have said - when
      understood dialectically, i.e., within certain bounds, conditionally,
      according to circumstances.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><A NAME="b"></A></P>
    
    <H4>b. Society as a Real Aggregate or a System</H4>
    
    <P>Let us now view society from this standpoint. There is no doubt that
      society constitutes a real aggregate, for there is a constant
      uninterrupted process of mutual interaction between its various parts. Mr.
      Smith went to the market; there he traded, exerted an influence on the
      formation of the market price, which in turn influenced the world market,
      perhaps in an infinitesimal degree, but nevertheless it was an influence
      on world prices; the latter, in turn, influence the market of the country
      in which Mr. Smith lives, and the little market which he frequents; on the
      other hand, let us say he buys a herring at the market; this will have an
      influence on his budget, for it will make him spend the rest of his money
      in a certain way, etc., etc. Thousands of such little influences be
      enumerated. Mr. Smith gets married for this purpose he has bought a number
      of presents and thus has exerted economic influence on other persons.
      Being an orthodox Christian, and not a Bolshevik, he calls in the priest
      and thus strengthens the Church organization, and this act will have its
      effect in little waves on the influence of the Church, and on the entire
      system of feelings and tendencies in the given society; he has paid money
      to the priest, and thus has increased the demand for the commodities
      demanded by priests, etc. His wife bears him children, and this in turn
      produces thousands of consequences. It is easy to see that many persons
      are influenced, in however slight a degree, by the fact of John Smith's
      marriage. Mr. Smith enters the Liberal Party in order to do his &quot;duty
      as a citizen&quot;. He begins to attend meetings, together with hundreds
      like him, to experience the same feelings of hatred for the cursed rascals
      who loaf about the streets and support those children of Satan, the
      Bolsheviks. Their influence at the meetings, touches and moves, either
      directly or indirectly, a great number of persons. To be sure, this
      influence may be difficult to ascertain but, no matter how small it may
      be, it yet exists. And no matter what branch of activity our Mr. Smith
      might enter, you would always observe that he had an influence on others;
      as well as others on him. For in society, all things are united by
      millions of little threads.</P>
    
    <P>We have begun with the individual man, and shown his influence on
      others. But we might just as well begin with the manner in which society
      acts <I>on him</I>. There is a great industrial boom, and the concern for
      which Smith is working as chief bookkeeper is making more profits; Mr.
      Smith gets a little &quot;raise&quot;. War breaks out; Mr. Smith is
      enlisted, defends the fatherland of his employers (he is convinced he is
      defending civilization) and is killed in the war. Such is the power of
      social relations.</P>
    
    <P>If we picture to ourselves the immense number of mutual interactions
      existing in human society, if only in our day, we shall find a magnificent
      picture taking shape before us. Some of these relations are of crude
      elemental force; they are not regulated in any way, or by any person; the
      interactions of persons on one another are countless in their expressions.
      But there are also many more or less regulated and organized forms, from
      government authority down to the chess club and the bald-headed men's
      society. If we consider that all these countless interactions are
      constantly intersecting each other, we shall understand how truly
      tremendous is the Babylonian confusion of influences and mutual
      interactions in social life.</P>
    
    <P>Wherever there is a mutual interaction of long duration, we have a real
      aggregate, a &quot;system&quot;. But we must point out the fact that a
      real aggregate or system is by no means necessarily characterized by a<I>
      conscious organization </I>of the parts of this system, and this statement
      is true both of animate nature and of inanimate nature, both of &quot;mechanisms&quot;
      and of &quot;organisms&quot;. Some persons go so far as to deny the very
      existence of society because there are other systems existing within
      society (classes, groups, parties, circles, organizations of various
      kinds, etc., etc.). But there is no doubt of the mutual interaction of
      these systems and groups within society (struggles between classes and
      parties, moments of cooperation, etc.); furthermore, the persons
      constituting these groups may be influencing the remaining persons in <I>other
      </I>connections in an entirely different way (the capitalist and the
      worker, who purchases from the same capitalist goods for his own
      consumption). Furthermore, these groups-in the mutual interactions between
      them-are not organized; we here have an elemental social product; a &quot;social
      resultant&quot; (see our discussion of determinism, in chapter ii) is
      nevertheless obtained in this unorganized and elemental process (which
      will continue until a communist society is realized). Yet, there is such a
      social &quot;product&quot;. It exists; it is an irrefutable fact of
      reality; world prices are a definite fact; so are world literature, or
      world routes of commerce, or world war; these facts are - sufficient to
      show that human society, embodied in the systems of the various nations,
      really does exist at the present time.</P>
    
    <P>In general, whenever we have a sphere of constant mutual interaction, we
      also have a special system, a special real aggregate. <I>The broadest
      system of mutual interactions, embracing all the more permanent
      interactions between persons, is society.</I></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">We define society as a real aggregate, or as a system
      of interactions, rejecting all the attempts of the so called &quot;organic
      school&quot; to interpret society in terms of an organism.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The official object of the &quot;organic&quot; theory
      is perfectly expressed in the fable of Menenius Agrippa, a Roman patrician
      who used the following &quot;organic&quot; arguments to conciliate the
      rebellious Plebeians: the hands may not rebel against the head, for
      otherwise the entire human body would be ruined. The social interpretation
      of the organic theory is the following: the ruling class is the head; the
      workers, or slaves, are the arms and legs; as arms and legs may not in
      nature replace the head, it is well for subordinates to hold their peace!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This wise humility on the part of the organic theory
      has made it quite popular among the bourgeoisie. The &quot;founder&quot;
      of sociology, Auguste Comte, considered society as a collective organism (<I>organisme
      collectif</I>); Herbert Spencer, the most popular of bourgeois
      sociologists, considered society to be something self-organic, without
      consciousness to be sure, but possessing organs, tissues, etc. René
      Worms even endows society with consciousness, as in the case of the
      individual, and Lilienfeld declares outright that society is an organism
      as much as a crocodile or the inventor of this theory. No doubt society
      has much in common with an organism; but it also has much in common with a
      mechanism. These traits, precisely, are the traits of any true totality,
      any system. But as we have no intention to take up such childish problems
      as to what constitutes the liver or the vermiform appendix of society, or
      what social phenomena are equivalent to ulcers, we shall not dwell on this
      point at all, the more since the adherents of the organic theory seem
      themselves to be ready to fall into the arms of mysticism, and to
      reconstruct society as a huge fabulous beast.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Society thus exists as a true aggregate of the persons composing it, as
      a system of mutually interacting elements. As we have seen, the number of
      mutual interactions in this system is endless. But the very existence of
      society suggests that all these numberless forces, acting in the most
      various directions, do not constitute a mere insane whirl, but move, as it
      were, through certain channels, in obedience to an internal law. If there
      were an outright and complete chaos, there would be no possibility of even
      an unstable equilibrium in society, in other words, there would be no
      society at all. We have discussed above the question as to the law of
      human actions, from the point of view of the individual (see chapter ii).
      We now take up the question from the other side, from the point of view of
      society and the conditions of its equilibrium. The result, however, is the
      same; we are brought to recognize the <I>regularity </I>of the social
      process. It is easiest to discover this uniformity. in the social process
      by an investigation of the conditions of social equilibrium. But before
      proceeding to this subject, we must dwell more in detail on the nature of
      society itself. It is not enough to say that it is a system of mutually
      interacting persons, or that this system is in force over a long period.
      It is necessary to explain the nature of this system, how it is
      distinguished from other systems, what is its necessary condition of life,
      and its necessary condition of equilibrium.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="c"></A></P>
    
    <H4>c. The Character of the Social Relations</H4>
    
    <P>The mutual interaction between persons, which constitutes social
      phenomena, is quite various. What is the <I>condition </I>for the
      permanence of these relations? In other words, where is the basic
      condition of equilibrium for the whole system, among all these
      interactions? What is the <I>basic </I>type of social relation without
      which all other types would be inconceivable?</P>
    
    <P>The basic social relation is that of <I>labor, </I>as expressed chiefly
      in <I>social labor, i.e., </I>in the conscious or unconscious work
      performed by people for each other. This becomes clear at once from an
      assumption of the opposite. Let us assume for a moment that the labor
      relation between persons should be destroyed, that products (goods) should
      not be transmitted from one place to another, that people should cease
      working for each other, that social labor should lose its social
      character. The result would be the disappearance of society, which would
      fly into a thousand pieces. Or, to take another example: Christian
      missionaries are sent to tropical countries to preach a knowledge of God
      and the Devil. These missionaries thus establish the so called higher
      intellectual relations. Would it be possible for these relations to endure
      between the country from which these gentlemen have set forth and the &quot;savages&quot;
      to whom they are sent, if there were no frequent steamers, no <I>regular
      </I>(as opposed to <I>casual) </I>exchange, <I>i.e., </I>if no working
      relations should be established between the &quot;civilized&quot;
      countries and the home of the &quot;savages&quot;? All such relations can
      only be permanent when they are of the nature of <I>working </I>relations.
      The bond of labor is the fundamental condition for the possibility of an
      internal equilibrium in the system of human society.</P>
    
    <P>We may also approach this question from another side. No system,
      including that of human society, can exist in empty space; it is
      surrounded by an &quot;environment&quot;, on which all its conditions
      ultimately depend. If human society is not adapted to its environment, it
      is not meant for this world; all its culture will inevitably pass away;
      society itself will be reduced to dust. Thinking as hard as they can, none
      of the idealist professors can offer the slightest proof in opposition to
      our assertion that all the life of society, the very question of its life
      or death, depends on the relation between society and its environment,
      i.e., nature. We have spoken of this above, and may consider the subject
      disposed of. The social relation between men which most clearly and
      directly expresses this relation to nature is the relation of work. Work
      is the process of contact between society and nature. By work, energy is
      transferred from nature to society; and it is on this energy that society
      lives and develops (if it develops at all). Labor is also an active
      adaptation to nature. In other words, the process of production is a
      fundamental living process. of society. Consequently, the labor relation
      is a fundamental social relation. Or, in the words of Marx, &quot;we must
      seek the anatomy of society in its economy&quot;,<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP>
      <I>i.e., </I>the structure of society is its <I>labor </I>structure (&quot;its
      economic structure&quot;). Consequently, our definition of society will
      read: <I>society is the broadest system of mutually interacting persons,
      embracing all their permanent mutual interactions, and based upon their
      labor relations.</I></P>
    
    <P>We have thus arrived at a completely <I>materialist </I>view of
      society. The basis of its structure is a working relation, just as the
      basis of life is the material process of production.</P>
    
    <P>The following objection is often raised: &quot;If things are as you say,
      how are the labor relations established? Do not people speak together,
      think together, in the process of labor? Is the labor relation then not a
      psychic, a spiritual relation? Where is your materialism now? What do all
      your labor and your labor relations amount to, if not to psychological
      relations?&quot;</P>
    
    <P>This question is worth going into, in order that future
      misunderstandings may be avoided. Let us begin with a simple example, that
      of a factory at work. In the factory there are unskilled workers and
      various types of skilled workers; some are working at certain machines,
      some at others; in addition, there are foremen, engineers, etc. Marx
      describes the condition as follows in his <I>Capital</I>:
      <SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#2" NAME="2b">2)</A></SUP> &quot;The
      essential division is, into workmen who are actually employed on machines
      (among whom are included a few who look after the engine) and into mere
      attendants (almost exclusively children) of these workmen. Among the
      attendants are reckoned, more or less, `feeders' who supply the machines
      with the material to be worked. In addition to these two principal
      classes, there is a numerically unimportant class of persons, whose
      occupation it is to look after the whole machinery and repair it from time
      to time; such as engineers, mechanics, joiners, etc.&quot; Such are the
      labor relations between the people in the factory. What is the prime
      nature of these relations? In the fact that each person is occupied with &quot;his
      own job&quot;, but his job is only a part of the whole. The individual
      worker is therefore stationed at a <I>certain </I>place, goes through a
      certain motion, has a certain <I>material </I>contact with things and
      with other workers, uses up a certain quantity of <I>material </I>energy.
      All these relations are material, physical relations. Of course, they may
      have their &quot;psychological&quot; side; people think, exchange
      thoughts, converse, etc. But these activities will be determined by their
      distribution in the factory building, by the machines at which they are
      stationed, etc. In other words, they are distributed through the factory
      as distinct physical bodies; they are therefore in certain physical,
      material relations in time and in space. Such is the material, working
      organization of the workers in a factory, which Marx calls the &quot;collective
      worker&quot;; we are now dealing with a material human working system.
      When in operation, we have the process of material labor; men give out
      energy, and turn out a material product. This is also a material process,
      also having its &quot;psychological&quot; aspect.</P>
    
    <P>What we have just observed in the factory is also applicable on a more
      intricate and far vaster scale in human society as a whole. For all of
      society constitutes a peculiar human working apparatus, in which the
      overwhelming majority of persons or groups of persons occupy a certain
      place in the working process. For instance, in present-day society, which
      includes all of so called &quot;civilized mankind&quot;, and perhaps even
      more, wheat, as we have seen, is chiefly produced in certain countries;
      cacao, in certain other countries; metal products, in still another group
      of countries, etc. And within the various countries, certain factories
      produce one group of products, other factories other products. All these
      workers, peasants, colonial slaves, and even the engineers, overseers,
      foremen, organizers, etc., who are placed in the various corners of the
      earth, distributed over the various quarters of the globe, are all
      actually, although perhaps not consciously, working for each other. And
      when masses of commodities pass #rom one country to another, from factory
      to market, from market through tradesman to consumer, all this constitutes
      a material bond between all these persons. They are a part of the material
      skeleton, the working apparatus of a single social life. When we read of
      the life of the bees, we do not consider it remarkable to find the writer
      beginning with the discussion of the kinds of bees, the work they perform,
      the relations between them, both in time and in space, in a word, the
      material working apparatus of the &quot;society of the bees&quot;. No one
      would think of considering the bees as a <I>psychical</I> aggregate, a &quot;spiritual
      brotherhood&quot;, although he might speak of the instincts and the
      psychic life of the bees, of their &quot;manners and customs&quot;, etc.
      But man, with his divine nature, must not be subjected to the same
      treatment as the bees!</P>
    
    <P>It is self-evident that psychical interactions of the most varied kinds
      are inestimably more numerous in human society than even in a herd of the
      most highly developed apes. The &quot;mind&quot; of human society, i.e.,
      all its psychic interactions, are as far superior to the &quot;mind&quot;
      of the herd of apes, as the mind of the individual man is superior to the
      mind of the individual ape. But the infinitely varied, complicated,
      exceptionally rich patterns of these mental and spiritual inter-relations,
      presenting all the colors of the rainbow, and constituting the &quot;mind&quot;
      of present-day society, also have their &quot;body&quot;, without which
      they cannot exist, any more than the mind of the individual man can exist
      without his sinful earthly body. This &quot;body&quot; is the labor
      skeleton, the system of material relations between persons in the process
      of labor, or, as Marx puts it, the <I>production relations</I>.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Sentimental petty bourgeois dames may think it &quot;terrible&quot;
      to explain the divine fragrance of the narcissus as due to an excitation
      of so prosaic an organ as the nasal mucous membrane; and these ladies are
      not much different from most bourgeois scholars. Some of the latter will
      venture to deride the &quot;organic theory&quot;, as does an Italian
      professor. A. Loria, who plagiarized Marx and could not digest him: &quot;The
      German scholar Schäffle goes to grotesque lengths in his enumeration
      of social strata, organs, segments, blood vessels, motor centers, nerves,
      and ganglia; but the other sociologists of the same school are not much
      more moderate than he. They have already gone so far as to describe the
      social thigh, the social solar plexus, the social lungs. They already
      point to the vascular system of society, represented by the savings banks.
      A professor at the Sorbonne describes the clergy as a fatty nervous
      tissue. Another sociologist compares the nerve fibers with telegraph
      wires, and the human brain with a central telegraph office. One
      writer .goes so far as to distinguish male nations from female nations. In
      his opinion, the conquering states are males, who subjugate the defeated
      nations; while the defeated nations &quot;are female nations.&quot;
      (Achille Loria: <I>Die Soziologie</I>, Jena, 1901, p.39.) This is all
      very well, but even the best of the bourgeois scholars become quite timid
      when they reach the confines of materialism. Professor E. Durkheim, in his
      book &quot;On the Division of Labor&quot;, having emphasized the
      conception of &quot;moral density&quot; (by which he means the frequency
      and intensity of psychical interactions between men), goes on to say: The
      moral density cannot become greater unless the material density
      simultaneously becomes greater&quot; (la densité morale me peut
      done s'accroître sans que la densité materielle s'accroisse
      en même temps . . .). This simply means that the &quot;mental
      turnover&quot; between men is based on the &quot;material turnover&quot;,
      i.e., the density and frequency of the material, physical interactions is
      the condition for the corresponding density and frequency of their mental
      interactions. After making this correct statement, M. Durkheim is
      frightened at having expressed so materialist a thought and beats a
      retreat: &quot;But it is useless (!!) to attempt to show which of the two
      phenomena determines the other; it is sufficient to have stated that they
      are indissoluble.&quot; (E. Durkheim: <I>De la division du travail social</I>,
      Paris 1893: p.283.) Useless, I suppose, because people are afraid to
      appear in decent bourgeois society as materialists.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Most modern bourgeois sociologists consider society to
      be a certain psychical system, a psychical &quot;organism&quot;, or the
      like, which is quite in accord with the idealist view of the universe. The
      fundamental error of these theories is in their separating &quot;mind&quot;
      from &quot;matter&quot;, and then declaring this &quot;mind&quot; to be
      incapable of explanation, i.e., their deifying it. In some societies, the
      psychical interactions are different from those of other societies. For
      instance, in the reign of Nicholas I, there was a &quot;spirit&quot; of
      police violence, of subjection under the Czar's might, love of the
      traditional, while Soviet Russia presents something quite different, i.e.,
      the psychical interrelations have become altogether different.
      Psychological theories of society cannot explain this difference; here
      again the only scientific conception is that of materialism (Marx speaks
      of an &quot;organism of production&quot;; cf. <I>Capital</I>, vol. iii).</FONT></P>

    <H4>d. Society and Personality; Precedence of Society over the Individual</H4>
    
    <P>Society consists of individual persons; it could not exist without them,
      as we may assume without further discussion. But society is not merely an
      aggregate of persons, constituting their sum. Society is more than a mere
      summation of its various Jacks and Jills. We have already seen that
      society is a real aggregate, a &quot;system&quot;; we have seen that it is
      a very complicated system of mutual interactions between the various
      persons, which interactions are extremely varied in quality and quantity.
      This means that society, as a whole, is greater than the sum of its parts.
      It cannot in any way be reduced to these parts, which is also true of many
      systems of various kinds, both living organisms and dead mechanisms. For
      instance, let us take the case of any machine, a simple watch, let us say.
      Take any such machine apart and lay its component parts in a heap. This
      heap will constitute their sum; but it will not be the machine; it will
      not be the watch; for the heap lacks the definite relation, the definite
      <I>mutual interaction</I>. of the parts which transforms them into a
      mechanism. What makes these parts a <I>whole</I>? A certain arrangement
      of them. The same is true in society; society consists of people; but if
      these people, in the labor process, should not be at their posts at each
      given moment, if they were not connected by the labor bond between them,
      there would be no society.</P>
    
    <P>We must here point out another phenomenon observed in society; namely,
      society consists not only of various persons mutually interacting, either
      directly or indirectly; it also consists of mutually interacting groups of
      persons, also constituting &quot;real aggregates&quot;, standing as it
      were <I>between </I>society and the individual. For instance, present-day
      society is exceedingly large; already people in the most remote countries
      have been brought into relation, are being drawn in further and further,
      by a labor bond; there is practically a world <I>society. </I>But this
      society of almost 1,500,000,000 persons mutually interacting, united by
      the fundamental tie (of labor), as well as countless other ties, includes
      within it partial systems of persons united in some way or other; classes,
      states, church organizations, parties, etc. This subject will be discussed
      in detail later. For the present, we must observe that within society
      there are a great number of groups of men; these groups, in turn, also
      consist of individual persons; the mutual interrelations between these
      persons usually become more frequent and intimate &quot;in their own
      circle&quot; than between men in general; the German philosopher and
      sociologist, G. Simmel, rightly observes that the narrower the circle of
      mutually interacting persons, the more intimate the relations between
      them, in general; besides, all these groups come into contact among
      themselves. In other words, the various individuals constituting society
      do not always influence each other directly, but through groups, through
      partial systems within the single great system of human society. Let us
      consider, for instance, an individual worker in capitalist society. Whom
      does he meet most frequently, with whom does he talk, discuss questions,
      etc.? Most often, it is with workers; very rarely does he meet artisans,
      or peasants, or bourgeois. This is an illustration of the existence of the
      class relation. This worker most frequently comes into contact with other
      classes, not simply as an individual personality, but as a member of his
      class, sometimes even as a member of a consciously organized body, a
      party, a trade union, etc. The same case applies also to the other groups
      in society, not only to classes: scholars associate mostly with scholars;
      journalists, with journalists; priests with priests, etc.</P>
    
    <P>In the material field, we find that society is not a mere aggregate of
      persons, that it is more than their sum, that their grouping and definite
      &quot;disposition&quot; (Marx calls it their &quot;distribution&quot;) in
      the labor process amounts to something new, something greater than their &quot;sum&quot;
      or &quot;aggregate&quot;. The same holds good also in the psychological (&quot;mental&quot;)
      life, which plays a very important part. We have already several times
      made use of the example of the fixing of a market price as a result of
      various individual guesses. The price is a social phenomenon, a social &quot;resultant&quot;,
      a product of the mutual interactions of persons. The price is not an
      average of the guesses, nor does it in every case approximate the
      individual guesses, for the individual guesses are a personal matter,
      concerning one man only, existing only in his mind, while the actual price
      is something that influences all; it is an independent fact which all must
      count on; an objective fact though it be immaterial (see chapter ii of
      this book); the price, in other words, is something new, something that
      leads its own social life, is independent more or less of individual
      persons, although it is created by them. The case with the remaining
      evidences of the psychical life is the same. Languages, the political
      system, science, art, religion, philosophy, and a great number of less
      important phenomena and subdivisions, such as fashions, customs, &quot;good
      behavior&quot;, etc., etc., all are products of social life, a result of
      the mutual interaction of persons, of their constant association with each
      other.</P>
    
    <P>Just as society is not merely a sum of the persons composing it, so the
      mental life of society is not merely a sum of the ideas and feelings of
      the individual persons composing it, but is a product of the association
      with each other, is to a certain extent something apart, new, not to be
      explained as a mere arithmetical sum; it is a new element resulting from
      the mutual interactions of persons.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">We can thus explain the necessity of special social
      sciences; Wundt correctly remarks: &quot;It is rather the uniting and
      interacting of individuals which produces this community as such, and
      thereby also awakens in the individual, performances specifically
      appertaining to the common life.&quot; (W. Wundt: <I>Völkeypsychologie</I>,
      vol. i, part i, Leipzig,. 1911, p.21.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Individual men are inconceivable outside of society,
      without society. Nor can we imagine society's having been established by
      the various persons, living, as it were, in their &quot;natural state&quot;,
      coming together and uniting in order to form a society. This conception
      was at one time quite widespread, but it is entirely erroneous. If we
      trace the development of human society, we shall find that it was
      originally composed of a herd, and not at all of individual creatures of
      human shape, living in various places, who suddenly discovered, one fine
      day, that it would be a fine thing (bright savages that they were!) to
      live together; and, having talked the thing over to the general
      satisfaction in their meetings, got together for the construction of a
      society. &quot;The starting point (of science, N. B.),&quot; wrote Karl
      Marx, &quot;is the individual, producing in society, and thence comes the
      socially conditioned production of these individuals. The individual and
      isolated hunter and fisher . . . belongs to the insipid illusions of the
      Eighteenth Century &quot;Production by isolated individual sons outside
      of society . . . is as great an absurdity (<I>Unding) </I>as would be the
      growth of language without the assumption of persons living together and
      talking with each other.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#3" NAME="3b">3)</A></SUP>
      </FONT></P>
    
    <P>The doctrine of the individual man entering into contractual relations
      with others was expressed with particular crassness in J. J. Rousseau's
      work, <I>Le Contrat social </I>(1762); man is born free in a &quot;state
      of nature&quot;; to assure his liberty, he enters into relations with
      others; society, as a state form, arises on the basis of the &quot;social
      contract&quot; (Rousseau draws no distinction between state and society). &quot;The
      object of the social contract,&quot; writes Rousseau (Book ii, chap. 5), &quot;is
      to protect the signatory parties.&quot; As a matter of fact, Rousseau does
      not investigate the true origin of the society or the state, but merely
      states what must be, what is the conception of society from the standpoint
      of &quot;reason&quot;, <I>i.e., </I>how a decent society should be
      constructed. Anyone violating the &quot;contract&quot; is subject to
      punishment. It followed logically that kings abusing their power must be
      deposed. Therefore, Rousseau's doctrine, in spite of its entirely
      erroneous conceptions, played an important revolutionary role during the
      French Revolution.</P>
    
    <P>Man's social qualities could develop only in society. It is an absurdity
      to suppose that man (in the savage state) could have recognized the
      advantages of society without ever having seen a society. This would
      really be equivalent to assuming the growth of language among persons not
      in contact with each other, and distributed in various places. Man always
      was, as Aristotle puts it, &quot;a social animal&quot;, i.e., an animal
      living in society, never out of society. We cannot imagine that human
      society was &quot;established&quot; (a merchant, who has himself
      established a corporation, may imagine that human society was brought
      about in the same way). Human society has existed as long as there have
      been humans; humans have never existed outside of society. Man is a social
      animal &quot;by his nature&quot;; his &quot;nature&quot; is a social
      nature, changing with society; he lives in society &quot;by his nature&quot;,
      and not by agreement or contract with other persons.</P>
    
    <P>Man having always lived in society, i.e., having always been social man,
      it follows that the individual has always had society as his environment.
      Since society has always constituted this environment for the individual,
      it is natural to infer that this environment has also determined the
      various individuals: one society, or environment, has produced one kind of
      individual; another society, another kind of individual; &quot;a man is
      known by the company he keeps&quot;.</P>
    
    <P>An interesting question which has been a source of many disputes, is
      that of <I>the role of the individual in history</I>.</P>
    
    <P>This question is not as difficult as it may seem. Does the individual
      play a part, or is he a mere zero in the course of events? Of course,
      since society consists of individuals, the action of any individual will
      have its influence on social phenomena. The individual does play a &quot;part&quot;;
      his actions, feelings, desires enter into the social phenomenon as a
      component part; &quot;men make history&quot;. Social phenomena are
      composed of the mutual interactions of the forces of the various
      individuals, as we have seen.</P>
    
    <P>Furthermore, if the various individuals influence society, is it
      possible to determine how the actions of the various individuals are
      brought about? Yes; for we know that the will of man is not free, that it
      is determined by external circumstances. Since the external circumstances,
      in the case of the individual, are social circumstances (the conditions of
      life of the family, the group, the given occupation, the class, the
      situation of the entire society at a certain moment), his volition will be
      determined by external conditions; from them he will draw the motives of
      his activity. For instance, the soldier in the Russian army at the time of
      Kerensky observed that his peasant farm was going to pieces, that life was
      getting harder, that there was no end of the war in sight, that the
      capitalists were becoming more impudent, and were not giving the land to
      the peasants. Thence arose the motives of his action: to put a stop to the
      war, seize the land, and, for this purpose, overthrow the government.
      Social circumstances therefore determine the individual's motives.</P>
    
    <P>These circumstances set the limits for the realization of the goals
      proposed by the individual person. Milyukov, in 1917, wished to strengthen
      the influence of the bourgeoisie and to lean for support on the Allies;
      but his desire was not realized; circumstances shifted so that Milyukov
      obtained nothing of what he wished.</P>
    
    <P>Furthermore, if we examine each individual in his development, we shall
      find that at bottom he is filled with the influences of his environment,
      as the skin of a sausage is filled with sausage-meat. Man &quot;is trained&quot;
      in the family, in the street, in the school. He speaks a language which is
      the product of social evolution; he thinks thoughts that have been devised
      by a whole series of preceding generations; he is surrounded by other
      persons with all their modes of life; he has before his eyes an entire
      system of life, which influences him second by second. Like a sponge he
      constantly absorbs new impressions. And thus he is &quot;formed&quot; as
      an individual. Each individual at bottom is filled with a social content.
      The individual himself is a collection of concentrated social influences,
      united in a small unit.</P>
    
    <P>Another circumstance is worthy of attention. Often the role of the
      individual is quite large by virtue of his specific place and the specific
      work which he performs. For instance, the general staff of an army
      consists of a small number of persons only, while the army itself counts
      hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of persons. It is apparent to
      anyone that the significance of the few persons in the general staff far
      exceeds that of the great number in the army (soldiers or officers). If
      the enemy should succeed in taking the general staff, this might be
      equivalent, under certain circumstances, to a defeat of the entire army.
      The importance of these few persons is therefore very great. But what
      would the general staff amount to without its telephone system, its
      reports, its announcements, its maps, its opportunities to issue orders,
      the discipline in the army, etc.? Very little. The persons constituting
      the general staff might be no more than the rest of the army; their
      strength, their significance is the result of a special social connection,
      of the organization within which these persons are working. To be sure,
      they may be capable of discharging their duties (they may have sufficient
      training or natural aptitude, the latter developed by experience, as was
      the case with many of Napoleon's generals, or with the commanders of the
      Red Army). But apart from this special connection, they lose their
      significance entirely. The opportunity on the part of the general staff to
      exert a powerful influence on the army is conditioned by the army itself,
      by its structure, its dispositions, by the aggregate of mutual
      interactions that have here been brought together.</P>
    
    <P>In society the case is the same. The role of political leaders, for
      instance, is much larger than the role of the average man of a certain
      class or party. Of course, it is necessary to have certain aptitudes,
      mental qualities, experience, etc., in order to become a political leader.
      But it is also clear that in the absence of the necessary organizations
      (parties, unions, a proper approach to the masses, etc.) the &quot;leaders&quot;
      could not play such an important part. It is the strength of the social
      bonds that gives strength to the individual persons of prominence. Quite
      similar is the case in other relations also, let us say with regard to
      inventors, scholars, etc. They can &quot;develop&quot; only under certain
      circumstances. Suppose an inventor, talented by nature, has had no
      opportunity to &quot;push himself&quot;, has learned nothing, read
      nothing, has been obliged to take up an entirely different activity, for
      instance, selling rags. His &quot;talent&quot; would go to pot; no one
      would ever hear of him. Just as the military leader is inconceivable
      without an army, so the technical inventor is inconceivable without
      machinery, apparatus and the people that go with them. And, on the other
      hand, if our rag-dealer should succeed in &quot;making his way in the
      world&quot;, i.e., in occupying a certain place in the system of social
      relations, he might become a second Edison. We might give any number of
      such examples, but it is self-evident that in all these cases society has
      a certain influence, and that it is impossible to &quot;develop&quot;
      except on the basis of this influence within which the social (class,
      group, general) demand is felt.</P>
    
    <P>Thus, the social relations themselves impart importance to the various
      individuals.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This point of view has made very slow headway, for the
      reasons so brilliantly revealed by M. N. Pokrovsky (<I>Outlines of the
      History of Russian Culture</I>, vol. i, p.3, in Russian). The
      historian, by reason of his personal situation, is a mental worker, an
      intellectual; proceeding to a consideration of his more specific earmarks,
      he is a man who does work in writing, a literary worker. What is more
      natural for him than to consider mental work as the chief substance of
      history, and literary works, from poems and romances to philosophical
      treatises and scientific publications, as the fundamental facts of
      civilization?&quot; Furthermore, &quot;men who do mental work - quite
      naturally &quot; were seized with the pride that dictated the hymns of
      praise to the Pharaohs. They began to believe that they were making
      history.&quot; It should be added that this professional standpoint fully
      coincided with the class standpoint of the ruling classes, the minority
      that dominated the great majority. It is not difficult to see that this
      emphasis and preference for leaders, particularly kings, princes, etc.,
      and also for so called geniuses - is closely allied with the religious
      point of view; for here the <I>social </I>power is overlooked, the power
      which is conferred by society on the individual; in its stead, the
      historian visualizes the inscrutable, i.e., actually, &quot;divine&quot;
      power of the individual person. This is excellently expressed by the
      Russian philosopher, V. S. Solovyov, in his <I>Justification of the Good,
      </I>chap. iv: &quot;The providential persons who have enabled us to share
      the heights of religion and of human enlightenment were originally by no
      means the creators of these possessions. That which they gave us was taken
      by them from earlier world-historic geniuses, heroes and martyrs, all of
      whom we must bear gratefully in mind. We must attempt to restore the full
      line of our mental ancestors, the men through whom <I>Providence </I>has
      been impelling mankind forward on the path to perfection. &quot; In these
      <I>'chosen vessels,' we worship that which He (the Heavenly Father) has
      imbued them with; in these visible counterfeits of invisible divinity, the
      divinity itself is recognized and worshiped</I>.&quot; This balderdash
      speaks for itself - it requires no refutation.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>It follows from the above that the &quot;individual&quot; always acts as
      a social individual, as a component part of a group, a class, a society.
      The &quot;individual&quot; is always filled with a social content, for
      which reason it is necessary, in an effort to understand the growth of
      society, to begin with a consideration of the social conditions, and to
      proceed from them, if that be necessary, to the individual; the contrary
      process is worthless. By means of the social relations - by an
      investigation of the conditions of the entire social life, the life of a
      class, of a trade group, the family, the school, etc.- we may more or less
       explain the development of the individual; but we could never explain the
      development of society by means of the development of the &quot;individual&quot;.
      For each individual, whatever be his activity, always has in mind what has
      already taken place in society; for example, when the buyer goes to market
      to buy shoes or bread, his price estimates are based on his personal
      approximation to prices now prevalent or formerly prevalent on the market.
      When the inventor devises a new machine, he proceeds on the basis of what
      is already in existence, on the basis of existing technique or existing
      science, on the problems presented by this science, on the demands of
      practical work, etc. In a word, if we should attempt - as do certain
      bourgeois scholars - to explain social phenomena on the basis of
      individual phenomena (on the individual psychology), we should have not an
      explanation, but an absurdity; the social phenomenon (for instance, the
      price) cannot be explained by the individual phenomenon (for instance, the
      value put upon the goods by Smith, Jones, or Robinson), but their
      estimates can be explained by the price which Smith, Jones, or Robinson
      had in mind from some previous occasion. We have therefore seen that the
      individual draws his motives from the generality, the social environment;
      the conditions under which the social environment develops provide the
      limits for the individual's activity; the individual's role is determined
      by social conditions. Society takes precedence over the individual.</P>

    <H4>e. Societies in Process of Formation</H4>
    
    <P>The fact that man has always existed in society by no means signifies
      that <I>new </I>societies may not be formed or that old societies may not
      grow.</P>
    
    <P>Let us assume that at a certain time various human groups are in
      existence at various points on the earth's surface, and that these human
      organizations have no relation whatever with each other; they are divided
      by mountains, rivers and oceans, and have not yet attained a stage of &quot;cultural
      development&quot; that would enable them to overcome these obstacles. If
      they succeed in coming into contact with each other at all, it is only at
      the rarest intervals, and with no regularity; a permanent relation does
      not exist between them.</P>
    
    <P>Under these circumstances, we cannot speak of a single great society
      embracing these various groups. Instead of a universal society, we have as
      many societies as there are groups of the kind mentioned, for the basis of
      society, its most outstanding characteristic, is a permanent <I>labor
      bond, </I>a series of &quot;production relations&quot;, constituting a
      skeleton for the entire system. In the case above described there is no
      such relation between the groups, no universal society, but a number of
      petty societies, each with its own special history.</P>
    
    <P>We cannot therefore speak of a union of &quot;men&quot; in a single
      society, but may only group them as &quot;men&quot;, as opposed to other
      animals; in other words, we may consider them as united in a biological
      group (as distinct from fleas, giraffes, elephants); but not in a social
      group from the standpoint of social science, of sociology; we are dealing
      with a single type of animal, but not with a single society. From the
      standpoint of biological unity, it is sufficient that these animals should
      have the same morphology, the same organs, etc. But sociological unity
      would require that these animals should <I>work together </I>in some way
      or other, not simultaneously, not merely in parallel activities, but
      together.</P>
    
    <P>Some go so far as to deny that society exists as a unit. For example,
      Professor Wipper says:<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#4" NAME="4b">4)</A></SUP>
      &quot;A completely closed system of natural economy has perhaps never
      existed from the beginning of civilization. We have always had commercial
      relations, colonization, migrations, propaganda. Doubtless, independent
      work has been done in certain places, much has been simultaneously
      accomplished within various geographical limits and conditions by
      independent effort, but perhaps the next following stage in evolution has
      in most cases been attained by a sudden bound, as a sort of premature
      lesson, crudely and imperfectly taught, but nevertheless repeated by
      others and later learned.&quot; But while there may never have been an
      <I>absolute, </I>complete system, there is no doubt whatever that the
      exchange relations existing between various human societies were once
      extremely slight. For instance, what relations existed between the
      European peoples and America. before Columbus? Even among the European
      peoples themselves - let us say - in the Middle Ages, relations were very
      weak. It is therefore impossible in such cases to speak of a single human
      society; humanity was then a unit only from the biological standpoint.</P>
    
    <P>Let us now suppose that contacts begin between our various societies,
      first, military contacts, then commercial relations. These commercial
      relations become more and more permanent; finally a time comes when one
      society cannot exist without the other; certain societies produce chiefly
      one thing, while others produce another thing; these products are
      exchanged and thus the societies work upon each other, this work now
      having a regular and not merely accidental character, which is necessary
      far the existence of both groups of societies. We now already have a <I>single
      society </I>on a large scale, formed by the union of societies once
      distinct from each other.</P>
    
    <P>The opposite process may also take place; under certain conditions,
      society may dissolve into a number of societies (usually under conditions
      of decline).</P>
    
    <P>It follows that society is not a permanent thing, existing from time
      immemorial for we may trace, the process of its formation. For example, we
      have seen such a process going on in the second half of the Nineteenth
      Century and the beginning of the Twentieth Century. In various ways
      (through colonial wars, the increase in exchanges of goods, export and
      import of capital, movement of population from one country to another, and
      the like) closet and closer mutual relations have been built up between
      countries. All countries have been joined by permanent economic bond,
      which means, in the last analysis, labor bond. A world economic system has
      resulted, world capitalism has grown up, all of whose parts are
      interrelated with each other. Together with the international movement of
      things and people: commodities, capital, workers, merchants, engineers,
      traveling salesmen, etc., a tremendous current of ideas has also been
      moving from country to country: scientific ideas, artistic ideas,
      philosophical ideas, religious ideas, political ideas, etc., etc. The
      world trade in ma terial things has brought with it a world exchange of
      mental products. A single human society has begun to exist, having a
      single history.</P>
