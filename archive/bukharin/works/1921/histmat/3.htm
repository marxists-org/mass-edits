    <H4>a. Materialism and Idealism in Philosophy; the Problem of the Objective</H4>
    
    <P>In our consideration of the question of the human will, the question
      whether it is free, or determined by certain causes, like everything else
      in the world, we arrived at the conclusion that we must adopt the point of
      view of determinism. We found that the will of man is not divine in
      character, that it depends on external causes and on the conditions of the
      human organism. This brought us face to face with the most important
      question that has troubled the human mind for thousands of years - the
      question as to the relation between matter and mind, which in simple
      parlance is often spoken of as the relation between &quot;soul&quot; and &quot;body&quot;.
      In general, we distinguish between two kinds of phenomena. Phenomena of
      the one kind have <I>extension, </I>occupy space, are observed through
      our external senses: we may see them, hear them, feel them, taste them,
      etc.; such we call material phenomena. Others have no place in space and
      cannot be felt or seen. Such, for example, are the human mind, or will, or
      feeling. But no one can doubt their existence. The philosopher Descartes
      considered just `` this circumstance to be the proof of man's existence;
      Descartes said <I>&quot;Cogito, ergo </I>sum&quot; - I think, therefore I
      am. Yet, man's thought cannot be felt or smelt; it has no color and cannot
      be directly measured in yards or meters. Such phenomena are called <I>psychical;
      </I>in simple language, &quot;spiritual&quot;. We have now to consider the
      question of the relation between these two kinds of phenomena. Is the mind
      &quot;the beginning of all things&quot;, or is it matter? Which comes
      first; which is the basis; does matter produce mind or does mind produce
      matter? What is the relation between the two? This question involves the
      fundamental conception of philosophy, on the answer to which dePend the
      answers to many other questions in the domain of the social sciences.</P>
    
    <P>Let us try to consider it from as many standpoints as possible. First of
      all, we must bear in mind that man is a part of nature. We cannot know for
      certain whether other more highly organized creatures exist on other
      planets, although it is probable that such do exist, for the number of
      planets seems endless. But it is clearly apparent to us that the being
      called &quot;man&quot; is not a divine creature, standing outside of the
      world, projected from some other, unknown, mysterious universe, but, as we
      know from the natural sciences, he is a product and a portion of nature,
      subject to its general laws. From the example of the world as we know it,
      we find that psychic phenomena, the phenomena of the so called &quot;spirit&quot;,
      are an infinitesimal portion of the sum of all phenomena. In the second
      place, we know that man has sprung from other animals, and that, after
      all, &quot;living creatures&quot; have been in existence on earth only for
      a time. When the earth was still a flaming sphere, resembling the sun
      today, long before it had cooled, there was no life on its surface, nor
      thinking creatures of any kind. Organic nature grew out of dead nature;
      living nature produced a form capable of thought. First, we had matter,
      incapable of thought; out of which developed thinking matter, man. If this
      is the case - and we know it is, from natural science - it is plain that 
      matter is the mother of mind; mind is not the mother of matter. Children
      are never older than their parents. &quot;Mind&quot; comes later, and we
      must therefore consider it the offspring, and not the parent, as the
      immoderately partisan worshipers of everything &quot;spiritual&quot; would
      make it.</P>
    
    <P>In the third place: &quot;mind&quot; does not appear until we already
      have <I>matter organized in a certain manner</I>.</P>
    
    <P>A zero cannot think; nor can a doughnut - or the hole in it - think; nor
      can &quot;mind&quot; think without matter. Man's brain, a part of man's
      organism, thinks. And man's organism is matter organized in a highly
      intricate form.</P>
    
    <P>In the fourth place: it is quite clear from the above why matter may
      exist without mind, while &quot;mind&quot; may not exist without matter.
      Matter existed before the appearance of a thinking human; the earth
      existed long before the appearance of any kind of &quot;mind&quot; on its
      surface. In other words, matter exists objectively, independently of &quot;mind&quot;.
      But the psychic phenomena, the so called &quot;mind&quot;, never and
      nowhere existed without matter, were never independent of matter. Thought
      does not exist without a brain; desires are impossible unless there is a
      desiring organism. &quot;Mind&quot; is <I>always </I>closely connected
      with &quot;matter&quot; (only in the Bible do we find the &quot;spirit&quot;
      hovering unaided over the waters). In other words: psychic phenomena, the
      phenomena of consciousness, are simply <I>a property of matter organized
      in a certain manner, a &quot;function&quot; of such master </I>(a function
      of a certain quantity is a second quantity depending on the first). Now
      man is a very delicately organized creature. Destroy this organization,
      disorganize it, take it apart, cut it up, and the &quot;mind&quot; at once
      disappears. If men were able to put together this system again, to
      assemble the human organism, in other words, if it were possible to take a
      human body apart and put it together again just as one may do with the
      parts of a clock, consciousness would also at once return; once the clock
      has been reassembled it will operate and start to tick; put together the
      human organism, and it will start to think. Of course, we are not yet able
      to do this. But we have already seen, in our discussion of determinism,
      that the state of &quot;mind&quot; of the consciousness, depends on the
      state of the organism. Intoxicate the organism with alcohol, the
      consciousness will become confused, the mind is befuddled. Restore the
      organism to its normal state (for instance, administer antidotes for toxic
      substances) and the mind will again begin to work in the normal manner.
      The above clearly shows the dependence of consciousness on matter, or in
      other words, &quot;of thought on life&quot;.</P>
    
    <P>We have seen that psychical phenomena are a property of matter organized
      in a certain manner. We may therefore have various fluctuations, various
      forms of material organization, and also various forms of mental life.
      <I>Man, </I>with his brain, is organized in one manner - he has the most
      perfect psychical life on earth - a true consciousness; the <I>dog </I>is
      organized in a different manner and the psyche of the dog therefore
      differs from that of man; the <I>worm </I>is also organized in a special
      manner, and the &quot;mind&quot; of the worm is consequently extremely
      poor, by no means comparable with that of man; the organization of the
      <I>stone </I>places it with inanimate matter, and it therefore has no
      psychic life at all. A special and intricate organization of matter is
      required for the appearance of a psyche. An extremely intricate
      organization of matter is the necessary presupposition for the appearance
      of an intricate psychic life, which we call a consciousness. On earth,
      this consciousness appears only when matter has been organized, as in the
      case of man, with his most complicated instrument, the brain in his head.</P>
    
    <P><I>Thus, mind cannot exist without matter, while matter may very well
      exist without mind; matter existed before mind; mind is a special property
      of matter organized in a special manner.</I></P>
    
    <P>It is not difficult to discern that idealism (the doctrine based on a
      fundamental idea underlying all things, a &quot;spirit&quot;), is simply a
      diluted form of the religious conception according to which a divine
      mysterious power is placed <I>above </I>nature, the human consciousness
      being considered a little spark emanating from this divine power, and man
      himself a creature chosen by God. The idealistic point of view, if pursued
      to its conclusion, leads to a number of absurdities, which are often
      defined with a serious face by the philosophers of the ruling classes.
      Particularly, we find associated with idealism such views as deny the
      external world, i.e., the existence of things objectively, independently
      of the human consciousness, sometimes also the existence of other persons.
      The extreme and most consistent form of idealism is the so called
      solipsism (Latin solos, &quot;alone&quot;, &quot;only&quot;; <I>ipse,
      </I>&quot;self&quot;). The solipsist reasons as follows: &quot;What data
      do I possess? My consciousness, nothing more; the house in which I live is
      present only in my sensations; the man with whom I speak, also only a
      sensation. In a word, nothing exists outside of myself, there is only my
      ego, my consciousness, my mental existence; there is no external world
      apart from me; it is simply a creature of my mind. For I am aware of only
      my own internal life, from which I have no means of escaping. Everything I
      see, hear, taste, everything about which I think and reason, is a
      sensation, a conception, a thought, of mine.&quot;</P>
    
    <P>This insane philosophy, concerning which Schopenhauer wrote that genuine
      supporters of it could be found only in the insane asylum (which did not
      prevent Schopenhauer, however, from considering the world <I>als Wille
      and Vorstellung, </I>&quot;as volition and concept&quot;, in other words,
      from being an idealist of the purest water), is contradicted by human
      experience at every step. When we eat, conduct the class struggle, put on
      our shoes, pluck flowers, write books, take a wife or a husband, none of
      us ever thinks of doubting the existence of the external world, <I>i.e.,
      </I>the existence - let us say - of the food we eat, the shoes we wear,
      the women we marry. None the less, this fallacy is based on the
      fundamental position of idealism. As a matter of fact, if &quot;mind&quot;
      is the basis of all things, what was the state of the case before man
      existed? There are two possible answers: either we must assume the
      existence of a certain extra-human, divine spirit of the variety mentioned
      in the ancient Biblical stories; or, we must assume that the events of
      ages long past are also the product of my imagination. The first solution
      leads us to so called objective idealism, which recognizes the existence
      of an external world independent of &quot;my&quot; consciousness. The
      essence of this world is found in its spiritual origin, in God, or in a &quot;supreme
      mind&quot; which here takes the place of God, in a &quot;world will&quot;,
      or in some other such hocus pocus. The second solution leads us straight
      into solipsism, through subjective idealism, which recognizes the
      existence only of spiritual beings, of a number of thinking subjects. It
      is easy to recognize solipsism as the most consistent form of idealism.
      But where does idealism find its basis as a matter of fact? Why does it
      consider the mental beginning to be more primitive and fundamental? For
      the reason, in the last analysis, that it assumes &quot;my&quot; data to
      consist of my sensations only. But if this is the case, I may doubt
      equally well the existence of a post in the yard, and of any other human
      being but myself, including my own parents. Thus solipsism commits
      suicide, for it destroys not only all of idealism in philosophy, but, in
      the consistent pursuit of its idealistic views, leads to a complete
      absurdity, to complete insanity, contradicted at every step by the actual
      practice of men.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Theoretical materialism and idealism must not be
      confused with &quot;practical idealism&quot; and &quot;materialism&quot;,
      for the latter have nothing to do with the former. A man who remains
      faithful to his ideal is called an &quot;idealist&quot; in the practical
      sense; he may be an outspoken opponent of philosophical idealism, of
      theoretical idealism. A communist who sacrifices his life is an idealist
      in practice, and yet a materalist through and through. The philistine who
      sobs to his Lord may have very idealistic notions, which do not prevent
      him, however, from being a base, stupid, selfish and narrow-minded
      creature.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Plato is commonly considered the founder of
      philosophical idealism: Plato believed that only &quot;ideas&quot; exist
      objectively, i.e., in reality. Men, pears, wagons, do not exist; the idea
      of a man, of a pear, of a wagon, does exist. These ideal patterns,
      existing from the beginning of time, dwell in a special supermundane
      resort of &quot;reason&quot;. What men consider to be pears, wagons, etc.,
      are merely wretched shadows of the corresponding idea. Above all these
      ideas there hovers, like the spirit of God, the supreme idea, the &quot;idea
      of the Good&quot;. A tendency to subjective idealism is usually found in
      those Greek philosophers known as Sophists (Protagoras, Gorgias, etc.),
      who set up the principle that &quot;man is the measure of all things&quot;.
      In the Middle Ages, the Platonic &quot;ideas&quot; began to be interpreted
      as models and patterns according to which the Lord shapes visible things.
      For instance, the louse that we see is created by God according to his &quot;louse-idea&quot;,
      which dwells in a supersensual world. More recently, Bishop Berkeley
      developed the view of subjective idealism, maintaining that only the
      spirit exists, the rest being mere imagination. Fichte believed that
      without a subject (a cognizing spirit) there could be no object (external
      world), and that matter is an expression of the idea. Schelling held ideas
      to be the essences of things, based on a divine eternity. All being,
      according to Hegel, is merely an effluvium of objective reason in the
      course of its unfolding.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Schopenhauer regards the world as will and conception
      <I>(Wille and Vorstellung). </I>Kant recognizes the existence of the
      objective universe <I>(Ding an sich), </I>but it is not subject to
      cognition and is immaterial in its nature. Idealism, with its many
      subdivisions, has become very strong in modern philosophy, by reason of
      the predilection of the bourgeoisie for everything that is mystical, an
      indication of its low morale, now full of despair, eager for mental
      solace.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">We first find tendencies to materialist philosophy in
      the ancient Greek philosophers of the so called Ionic school, who
      considered matter to be the basis of all being, but likewise believed that
      all matter was capable of more or less feeling. These philosophers were
      therefore called <I>Hylozoists </I>(those who put life into matter; from
      Greek <I>hyle</I>, &#944;&lambda;&eta;, matter; and <I>zoe, </I>&#941;&omega;&#942;, life).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Of course these first steps were rather unsatisfactory
      in their result. Thus, Thales sought the basis of all being in water;
      Anaximenes, in air; Heraclitus, in fire, Anaximander, in a certain
      substance of indefinite nature and embracing all things, called by him
      <I>apeiron, </I>the &quot;infinite&quot;, &quot;unlimited&quot;. The
      Hylozoists also included the Stoics, who considered all existing things to
      be material. Materialism was further developed by the Greeks Democritus
      and Epicurus, later by the Roman Lucretius Carus. Democritus magnificently
      expounded the basis of the atomistic theory. According to his doctrine the
      world consists of moving, falling material particles, atoms, whose
      combinations constitute the invisible universe. In the Middle Ages, the
      idealistic claptrap prevailed on the whole. The brilliant and profound
      intellect of Baruch Spinoza developed the idea of the Hylozoist
      materialists. In England, the materialist standpoint was defended by
      Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679). Materialism was much encouraged in the period
      preliminary to the French revolution, which produced a number of excellent
      materialist philosophers: Diderot, Helvetius, Holbach (whose chief work,
      <I>Système de la nature, </I>appeared in 1770), Lamettrie <I>(Man
      a Machine, </I>1785).. This group of philosophers of the then
      revolutionary bourgeoisie has furnished us with excellent formulations of
      the materialistic theory (<I>cf. </I>N. Beltov: On <I>the Question of
      Evolution of the Monistic View of History, </I>and N. Lenin: <I>Materialism
      and Empirio-Criticism, </I>pp. 26 et seq.). Diderot ingeniously
      derided the idealists of the type of Berkeley: &quot;In a moment of
      madness, the sentient piano imagined it was the only piano existing in the
      world, and that the entire harmony of the universe was accomplished within
      itself&quot; (<I>Oeuvres complètes de Diderot, </I>Paris, 1875,
      vol. ii, p. 118) In Germany, in the Nineteenth Century, this cause was
      advanced by Ludwig Feuerbach, who had a great influence on Marx and
      Engels, and they, in turn, furnished the most complete theory of
      materialism, by combining it with the dialectic method (see below), and
      extended the materialistic theory to the social sciences, banishing
      idealism from its last place of refuge. Of course, the senile bourgeoisie,
      now drooling about God like a soft-brained old man, regards materialism
      with hatred. It is easy to understand that materialism necessarily will be
      the revolutionary theory of the young revolutionary class, the
      proletariat.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><A NAME="b"></A></P>
    
    <H4>b. The Materialist Attitude in the Social Sciences</H4>
    
    <P>Everyone will understand that this dispute between materialism and
      idealism cannot possibly fail to be expressed in the social sciences also.
      In fact, human society presents a number of phenomena of various kinds.
      For instance, we find &quot;exalted matters&quot; such as religion,
      philosophy and morality; we also find innumerable ideas held by men, in
      various fields; we find an exchange of goods or a distribution of
      products; we find a struggle between various classes among themselves;
      there is a production of products, wheat, rye, shoes, machinery, varying
      with the time and place. How shall we proceed to explain this society?
      From what angle shall we approach it? What shall we consider its
      fundamental element, and what its secondary, or resulting element? All
      these are obviously the same questions that have been faced by philosophy
      and that have necessarily divided the philosophers into two great
      camps-that of the materialists and that of the idealists. On the one hand,
      we may imagine persons approaching society in approximately the following
      manner: society consists of persons, who think, act, desire, are dominated
      by ideas, thoughts, &quot;opinions&quot;, from which they infer: &quot;opinion
      dominates the world&quot;; an alteration of &quot;opinion&quot;, a change
      in the views of men is the fundamental cause of everything that goes on in
      society; in other words, social science must in the first place
      investigate precisely this phase of the matter, namely, the &quot;social
      consciousness&quot;, the &quot;mind of society&quot;. Such would be the
      idealist standpoint in the social sciences. But we have seen above that
      idealism involves an admission of the independence of ideas from the
      material, and of the dependence of these ideas on divine and mysterious
      springs. It is therefore obvious that the idealist point of view involves
      a downright mysticism, or other tomfoolery, in the social sciences, and
      consequently leads to a destruction of these <I>sciences, </I>to their
      substitution by <I>faith </I>in the acts of God or in some other such
      conception. Thus, the French writer Bossuet (in his <I>Reflections on
      Universal History, </I>1682) declares that history reveals a &quot;divine
      guidance of the human race&quot;; the German idealist philosopher Lessing
      declares that history is an &quot;education of the human race by God&quot;;
      Fichte states that reason is manifest in history; Schelling, that history
      is a &quot;constant and progressively discovered revelation of the
      Absolute&quot;, in other words, of God. Hegel, the greatest philosopher of
      idealism, defined the history of the world as a &quot;rational, necessary
      evolution (<I>Gang</I>) of the world spirit&quot;. Many other
      such examples could be given, but the above will suffice to show how close
      is the connection between philosophical views and those prevailing in the
      social sciences.</P>
    
    <P>The idealist forms of the social sciences and the idealist sociologists
      therefore behold in society, first of all, &quot;the idea&quot; of this
      society; they consider society itself as something psychical, immaterial;
      society in their opinion is a great mass of human desires, feelings,
      thoughts, wills, confused in endless combinations; in other words, society
      is social psychology and the social consciousness is the &quot;mind&quot;
      of society.</P>
    
    <P>But society may also be approached from an entirely different
      standpoint. In our discussion of determinism, we found that man's will is
      not free, that it is determined by the external conditions of man's
      existence. Is not society also subject to these laws? How shall we explain
      the social consciousness? On what does it depend? The mere formulation of
      these questions brings to mind the materialist standpoint in social
      science. Human society is a product of nature. Like the human race itself,
      it depends on nature and may exist only by obtaining its necessities from
      nature. This it does by the process of production. It may not always do so
      consciously; a conscious process is possible only in an organized society,
      in which everything proceeds according to a plan. In unorganized society,
      the process goes on unconsciously: for example, under capitalism, the
      manufacturer wishes to obtain more profits and therefore increases his
      production (but not for the purpose of affording assistance to human
      society). The peasant produces, in order to provide himself with food, and
      to sell a portion of his production to pay his taxes; the tradesman, in
      order to keep himself above water and establish himself in society; the
      worker, in order not to starve. As a result, the entire society in some
      way continues to muddle along, for better or for worse. <I>Material
      production and its means </I>(&quot;the material productive forces&quot;)
      are the foundation of the existence of human society. Without it, there
      cannot be a &quot;social consciousness&quot;, &quot;mental culture&quot;,
      just as there cannot be a thought without a thinking brain. We shall take
      up this question in detail later on; for the present let us consider only
      the following; let us imagine two human societies; one, a society of
      savages; the other, a society in the final stage of capitalism. In the
      former society, all activities are devoted to the immediate securing of
      foodstuffs, hunting, fishing, the gathering of roots, primitive
      agriculture; of &quot;ideas&quot;, of &quot;mental culture&quot;, etc.,
      there is very little; we are dealing here with men that are hardly more
      than monkeys, tribal animals. In the second example, we have a sublime &quot;mental
      culture&quot;, a great Babylonian confusion of morality; justice, with its
      countless laws; highly evolved, endless sciences, philosophies, religions,
      and arts, from architecture down to fashion plates. And yet, this
      Babylonian confusion is of one type where the bourgeoisie rules; it is
      quite different where proletarians rule; different again for the peasants,
      etc. In a word, in this case, as we usually put it, the sublime &quot;mental
      culture&quot;, the &quot;mind&quot; of society, the sum of &quot;ideas&quot;,
      is extremely developed. How was it possible for this mind to develop? What
      were the conditions of its growth? The growth of <I>material production,
      </I>the increase in the power of man over nature, the increase in the <I>productivity
      of human labor. </I>For, when not all the available time is consumed in
      exhausting material labor, people are free a portion of the time, which
      affords them an opportunity to think, reason, work with a plan, create a &quot;mental
      culture&quot;. As everywhere else, so in society also, matter is the
      mother of mind and not mind the mother of matter; it is not the social &quot;mental
      culture&quot; (&quot;social consciousness&quot;) that produces the
      substance of society, <I>i.e., </I>above all, material production, the
      obtaining of all kinds of useful objects from nature by society, but it is
      the evolution of this social substance, <I>i.e., </I>the evolution of
      material production, that creates the foundation for the growth of the so
      called &quot;mental culture&quot;. In other words, the spiritual life of
      society must necessarily depend on the conditions of material production,
      on the stage that has been attained in the growth of the productive forces
      in human society. <I>The mental life of society is a function of the
      forces of production. </I>What this function is, just how the mental life
      of society grows out of the productive forces: that is a subject that will
      be discussed later. For the present we may only observe that this view of
      society naturally makes us consider it <I>not </I>as an aggregate of all
      possible kinds of opinions, particularly in the domain of the &quot;sublime
      and beautiful&quot;, the &quot;elevated and pure&quot;, but first of all
      as a <I>working organization </I>(Marx sometimes called it a &quot;productive
      organism&quot;).</P>
    
    <P>Such is the materialist point of view in the domain of sociology. This
      point of view, as we know, by no means denies that &quot;ideas&quot; have
      their effects. Marx even said distinctly, in discussing the highest stage
      of consciousness, which is scientific <I>theory</I>:<I> &quot;Every </I>theory
      becomes a force when it secures control over masses.&quot; But
      materialists cannot be satisfied with a mere reference to the fact that &quot;people
      thought so&quot;. They ask: why did people in a certain place, at a
      certain time, &quot;think&quot; so, and &quot;think&quot; otherwise under
      other conditions? In fact, why do people think such an awful lot anyway in
      &quot;civilized&quot; society, producing whole mountains of books and
      other things, while the savage does not &quot;think&quot; at all? We shall
      find the explanation in the material conditions of the life of society.
      Materialism is therefore in a position to explain the phenomena of &quot;mental
      life&quot; in society, which idealism cannot, for idealism imagines &quot;ideas&quot;
      developing out of themselves, independently of the base earth. For this
      very reason the idealists, whenever they wish to construct any real
      explanation, are forced to resorting to the divine: &quot;This Good&quot;,
      wrote, Hegel in his <I>Philosophy of History, </I>&quot;this Reason in
      its most concrete conception, is God; God rules the world ; the content of
      his government <I>Regierung), </I>the execution of his plan, is universal
      history:'<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP> To drag
      in this poor old man who constitutes perfection, according to his
      worshipers, and who is obliged to create, together with Adam, lice and
      prostitutes, murderers and lepers, hunger and poverty syphilis and vodka,
      as a punishment for sinners whom he created and who commit sins by his
      desire, and to continue playing this comedy forever in the eyes of a
      delighted universe - to drag in God is a necessary step for idealist
      theory. But from the point of view of science it means reducing this &quot;theory&quot;
      to an absurdity.</P>
    
    <P>In other words, in the social sciences also, the materialist point of
      view is the correct one.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The consistent application of the materialist point of
      view to the <I>social </I>sciences is the work of Marx and Engels. In the
      year (1859) in which Marx's book, <I>A Contribution to the Critique of
      political Economy, </I>which presents an outline of his sociological
      theory (the theory of historical materialism) appeared, there also
      appeared the principal work of Charles Darwin (<I>Origin of Species</I>),
      whose author maintained and proved that changes in the animal and
      vegetable kingdoms are influenced by the material conditions of existence.
      But it by no means follows that the Darwinian laws may be applied without
      further ado to society. We have first to prove the peculiar form in which
      the general laws of natural science are applicable in human society, a
      form characteristic of human society only. Marx bitterly derided anyone
      who failed to understand this; thus he wrote, concerning the German
      scholar F. A. Lange: &quot;Herr Lange, it seems, has made a great
      discovery : all history must be sublimated under a single great law of
      nature. This law of nature is the <I>phrase </I>(for in this use,
      Darwin's expression is a mere phrase), the `struggle for life'. Instead of
      analyzing this `struggle for life , which expresses itself historically in
      distinct and varied forms of society, all you need do is to re-christen
      any concrete struggle with the phrase struggle for life':' (Letters to
      Kugelmann, June 27, 1870<I>, Die Neue Zeit, </I>1902, vol. 20, pp. 541,

      so called Utopian socialists (Saint Simon). But before Marx, the

    <H4>c. The Dynamic point of View and the Relation Between Phenomena</H4>
    
    <P>There are two possible ways of regarding everything in nature and in
      society; in the eyes of some, everything is constantly at rest, immutable
      ; &quot;things ever were and ever will be thus&quot; ; &quot;there is
      nothing new under the sun.&quot; To others, however, it appears that there
      is nothing unchanging in nature or in society; &quot;all earthly things
      have passed away&quot;; &quot;there is no going back to the past.&quot;
      This second point of view is called the <I>dynamic </I>point of view
      (Greek <I>dynamis</I>, &quot;force&quot;, &quot;motion&quot;); the former
      point of view is called static. Which is the correct position? Is the
      world an immovable and permanent thing, or is it constantly changing,
      constantly in motion, different today from yesterday? Even a hasty glance
      at nature will at once convince us that there is nothing immutable about
      it. People formerly considered the moon and the stars to be motionless,
      like golden nails driven into the sky; likewise, the earth was motionless,
      etc. But we now know that the stars, the moon, and the earth are dashing
      through space, covering enormous distances. And we also know that the
      smallest particles of matter, the atoms, consist of still smaller
      particles, electrons, flying about and revolving within the atom, as the
      heavenly bodies of the solar system revolve around the sun. But the whole
      world consists of such particles, and how can anything be considered
      constant in a universe whose component parts gyrate with whirlwind speed?
      It was formerly also believed that plants and animals were as God created
      them: ass and asafoetida, bedbug and leprosy bacillus, plant-louse and
      elephant, cuttlefish and nettle, all were created by God, in the first
      days of creation, in their present form. We now know that such was not the
      case. The forms of animals and plants are not such as the Lord of creation
      deigned to make them. And the animals and plants now living on earth are
      quite different from those of other days; we still find skeletons or
      impressions in the rock, or remnants in the ice, of the huge beasts and
      plants of bygone ages: gigantic flying beasts covered with scales
      (pterodactyls), huge horse-tails and ferns (whole forests, later petrified
      into anthracite coal, a remnant of the primeval forests of prehistoric
      days), veritable monsters, such as ichthyosauri, brontosauri, iguanadons,
      etc. All these once existed and are now extinct. But we then had no
      fir-trees, birches, cows, or sheep, in a word, &quot;all is changing under
      our zodiac&quot;. What is more, there were no humans, for the latter
      developed from hairy semi-apes not very long ago. We no longer marvel at
      the changes that have taken place in the forms of animals and plants. But
      it should surprise us still less that we ourselves may outdo the Almighty
      in this field: any good swine-herd, by an appropriate choice of food and
      an appropriate mating of male and female can continue to produce new
      races; the Yorkshire hog, which is so fat that it cannot walk, is a
      creature of human effort, as is also the pineapple-strawberry, the black
      rose, and many a variety of domestic animals and cultivated plants. Is not
      man himself constantly changing under our very eyes? Does the Russian
      worker of the revolutionary epoch even externally resemble the Slavic
      savage and hunter of bygone days? The race and appearance of men are
      subject to change with everything else in the world.</P>
    
    <P>What is the inference? Evidently, that there is nothing immutable and
      rigid in the universe. We are not dealing with rigid things, but with a
      process. The table at which I am writing at this moment cannot be
      considered an immutable thing: it is changing from second to second. To be
      sure, these changes may be imperceptible to the human eye or ear. But the
      table, if it should continue to stand for many years would rot away and be
      transformed into dust and this would merely be a repetition of all that
      has gone before. Nor would the particles of the table be lost. They would
      assume another form, would be carried away by the wind, would become a
      portion of the soil, serving as a nourishment for plants, thus being
      transformed, for instance, into plant tissue, etc.; there is therefore a
      constant change, a constant journey, a constant succession of new forms.
      Matter in motion: such is the stuff of this world. It is therefore
      necessary for the understanding of any phenomenon to study it in its
      process of origination (how, whence, why it came to be), its evolution,
      its destruction, in a word, its motion, and not its seeming state of rest.
      This dynamic point of view is also called the <I>dialectic </I>point of
      view (other traits of dialectics will be treated below).</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The difference between the dynamic and static point of
      view is already found in the ancient Greek philosophers. The so called
      Eleatic School, headed by Parmenides, taught that everything was
      immovable. According to Parmenides, being is eternal, constant, unchanged,
      unique, uniform, indivisible, homogeneous, immutable, like a round sphere
      at rest. Zeno, an Eleatic philosopher, sought to prove, by means of very
      ingenious observations, that motion was impossible at all. Heraclitus, on
      the other hand, taught that there was nothing that did not move; he
      maintained that &quot;everything flows&quot;, nothing rests (<I>panta
      rei, pauta rei</I>); according to Heraclitus, it was impossible to descend
      twice into the same river, for the second time the river would already be
      a different river. His associate, Kratylos, was of the opinion that it was
      impossible to bathe even once in the same river, since the latter was
      constantly changing. Democritus also assumed motion to be the basis of all
      things, specifically, a straight-line motion of atoms. Among modern
      philosophers, Hegel, of whom Marx was a disciple, defended <I>motion </I>and
      <I>becoming </I>(origin, transformation from not-being into being) with
      particular persistence. But, for Hegel, the basis of the universe was the
      movement of mind, while Marx-to use the latter's own words - turned
      Hegel's dialectics upside down, replacing the movement of mind by the
      movement of matter. In the natural sciences, the view still prevailed at
      the beginning of the Nineteenth Century which was expressed by the famous
      scientist Linnaeus : &quot;There are as .many species as the Supreme Being
      has created.&quot; (Theory of the persistence of species.) The most
      important advocate of the opposite view was Lamarck and later, as already
      indicated, Charles Darwin, who finally refuted the old conceptions.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The world being in constant motion, we must consider phenomena in their
      mutual relations, and not as isolated cases. All portions of the universe
      are actually related to each other and exert an influence on each other.
      The slightest motion, the slightest alteration in one place,
      simultaneously changes everything else. The change may be great or small -
      that is another matter - at any rate, there is a change. For example: let
      us say the Volga forests have been cut down by men. The result is that
      less water is retained by the soil, with a resulting partial change in
      climate; the Volga &quot;runs dry,&quot; navigation on its waters becomes
      more difficult, making necessary the use, and therefore the production, of
      dredging machinery; more persons are employed in the manufacture of such
      machinery; on the other hand, the animals formerly living in the forests
      disappear; new animals, formerly not dwelling in these regions, put in
      their appearance; the former animals have either died out or migrated to
      forest areas, etc.; and we may go even further: with a change in climate, 
      it is clear that the condition of the entire planet has been changed, and
      therefore an alteration in the Volga climate to a certain extent changes
      the universal climate. Further, if the map of the world is changed to the
      slightest extent, this involves also a change - we must even suppose - in
      the relations between the earth and the moon or sun, etc., etc. I am now
      writing on paper with a pen. I thus impart pressures to the table; the
      table presses upon the earth, calling forth a number of further changes. I
      move my hand, vibrate as I breathe, and these motions pass on in slight
      impulses ending Lord knows where. The fact that these may be but small
      changes, does not change the essential nature of the matter. All things in
      the universe are connected with an indissoluble bond nothing exists as an
      isolated object, independent of its surroundings. Of course, we are not
      obliged at every moment to pay attention to the universal concatenation of
      phenomena: a discussion of poultry- raising need not always lead us into a
      discussion of everything else same time, the sun, the moon, for instance;
      which would be folly, for in this case the universal bond of all phenomena
      would not help us. But in a discussion of theoretical questions it is very
      often necessary for us to bear this relation in mind; even in practice it
      cannot always be ignored. We are in the habit of saying that a certain man
      cannot &quot;see further than his nose&quot;, which means that he
      considers his environment as isolated, as having no relation with what
      lies beyond it. Thus, the peasant brings his product to the market,
      thinking he will make a handsome profit, but suddenly finds prices so low
      that he hardly recovers his outlay. The market <I>binds </I>him together
      with the other producers, it transpires that so much grain has been
      produced and thrown on the market that only a low price can be obtained.
      How could our peasant make such a mistake? Simply because he did not (and
      could not from his out-of-the-way home) observe his own relations with the
      world market. The bourgeoisie, instead of becoming richer after the war,
      found itself facing a revolution of the workers, for the reason that this
      war was connected with a number of other things which the bourgeoisie did
      not understand. The Mensheviks and the Social-Revolutionaries, the Social
      patriots in all countries, declared that the Bolshevik power in Russia
      could not maintain itself for long; the root of their error was in the
      fact that they regarded Russia as an isolated case, having no relation
      with all of Western Europe or with the growth of the world revolution,
      which lends assistance to the Bolsheviks. When, in simple parlance, we
      rightly say that &quot;all the circumstances must be taken into
      consideration , what we really mean is that a given phenomenon or a given
      question must be considered with regard to its connections with other
      phenomena, indissoluble union with &quot;all the circumstances&quot;.</P>
    
    <P><I>In the first place, therefore, the dialectic method of
      interpretation demands that all phenomena be considered in their
      indissoluble relations; in the second place, that they be considered in
      their state of motion.</I></P>
    
    <P><A NAME="d"></A></P>
    
    <H4>d. The Historical Interpretation of the Social Sciences</H4>
    
    <P>Since everything in the world is in a state of change, and indissolubly
      connected with everything else, we must draw the necessary conclusions for
      the social sciences.</P>
    
    <P>Let us consider human society, which has by no means been always the
      same. A number of very different forms of human society are known to us.
      For instance, in Russia, the working class has held power since November,
      1917, supported by a portion of the peasantry, while the bourgeoisie is
      being kept within bounds, although a part of it (about 2,000,000) has
      emigrated. The workers' state controls the factories, machine shops,
      railroads. Before 1917, the bourgeoisie and the landowners were in power,
      controlling everything, and the workers and peasants labored for them. At
      a still earlier period, before the so called Liberation of the Peasants,
      in 1861, the bourgeoisie was for the greater part a trading class; there
      were few factories; the landholders ruled the peasants like cattle, and
      had the right to whip them, sell them, or exchange them. If we trace the
      course of bygone centuries, we shall find semi-savage nomadic tribes. So
      slight is the similarity between these various forms of society that if we
      should be able by a miracle to resuscitate a robust feudal landowner,
      given to whippings and greyhounds, and to bring him - let us say - into a
      meeting of a factory or works committee, or Soviet, the poor fellow would
      probably die of heart-failure at once.</P>
    
    <P>We are also acquainted with other forms of society. In ancient Greece,
      for example, when Plato and Heraclitus were constructing their
      philosophies, everything was built up on the labor of slaves, who were the
      property of the great slaveholders. In the ancient American state of the
      Incas, there was a regulated and organized society dominated by a class of
      priestly nobles, a sort of intelligentsia, which controlled and managed
      everything, and guided the national economy, a ruling class superior to
      all other classes. We might give many other examples as evidence of the
      constant flux in the social structure. Nor does this necessarily mean that
      the human race has constantly improved, <I>i.e., </I>gradually approached
      perfection. We have already pointed out that there have been many cases of
      the destruction of very highly developed human societies. Thus, for
      example, the land of the Greek sages and slaveholders passed away. But
      Greece and Rome at least had an enormous influence on the later course of
      history; they served as a fertilizer for history. But it has sometimes
      happened that entire civilizations have disappeared without a trace in
      other peoples and other times. For example, Professor Eduard Meyer writes
      concerning the evidences of an ancient civilization discovered in France
      by means of excavations: &quot;We are here dealing with a highly developed
      civilization of primitive men &#133;.. which was subsequently destroyed by
      a tremendous catastrophe and had <I>no influence </I>whatever on future
      ages. There is <I>no historical relation </I>between this Palaeolithic
      culture and the beginnings of the neolithic epoch:<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#2" NAME="2b">2)</A></SUP>
      But <I>while we may not always observe growth, there is always motion and
      alteration, though it may end in destruction or dissolution.</I></P>
    
    <P>Such motion is observed not only in the fact that the social system is
      in process of change; for social life as such is constantly changing <I>decisively
      in all its expressions. </I>The technology of society is changing: we need
      only to compare the stone hatchets and spear-heads of ancient times with
      the steam-hammer; manners and customs change: for instance, we know that
      certain races of man take pleasure in eating the captives they have taken,
      which even a French imperialist of the present day would not do himself
      (but he will have his black troops, in the process of serving
      civilization, cut the ears off dead bodies); certain tribes had the habit 
      of killing their old men or young girls, and this practice was considered
      highly moral and holy. The political system is changing: we have seen with
      our own eyes how the autocracy yielded to a democratic republic, then to a
      Soviet republic; scientific views, religion, every-day life and all the
      relations between these, change; even the things we consider essential,
      fundamental, were by no means always as they are, we have not always had
      newspapers, soap, clothing; we have not even always had a state, faith in
      God, capital, firearms. Even the conception of what is beautiful and not
      beautiful is subject to change. The forms of family life are not
      immutable: we are aware of the existence of polygamy, polyandry, monogamy,
      and &quot;promiscuous cohabitation&quot;. In other words, social life
      suffers constant change together with everything else in nature.</P>
    
    <P>Human society therefore passes through different stages, different
      forms, in its evolution or decline.</P>
    
    <P>It follows, in the first place, that <I>we must consider and
      investigate each form of society in its own peculiar terms. </I>We cannot
      throw into a single pot all epochs, periods, social forms. We cannot
      consider under a single head, and recognize no differences between, the
      feudal, the slaveholding, and the proletarian workers' systems of society.
      We cannot afford to overlook the differences between the Greek
      slaveholder, the Russian feudal landowner, the capitalist manufacturer.
      The slaveholding system is one thing; it has its special traits, its
      earmarks, its special growth. Feudalism is another type; capitalism, a
      third, etc. And communism - the communism of the future - also has its
      special structure. The transition period preceding it - the period of
      proletarian dictatorship, is also a special system. Each such system has
      peculiar traits that require special study. By this means only, can we
      grasp the process of change. For, since each form has its special traits,
      it also must have its special laws of growth, its special laws of motion.
      For instance, Marx says, in <I>Capital, </I>concerning the capitalist
      system, that the main object of his study is to discover &quot;the laws of
      motion of capitalist society&quot;. For this purpose, Marx had to explain
      all the peculiarities of capitalism, all its characteristic traits; only
      thus could he discover its &quot;law of motion&quot; and <I>predict </I>the
      inevitable absorption of petty production by largescale production, the
      growth of the proletariat, its collision with the bourgeoisie, the
      revolution of the working class, and, together with this, the transition
      to the dictatorship of the proletariat. Most bourgeois historians do not
      proceed thus. They are inclined to confuse the merchants of ancient times
      with the present-day capitalists, the parasite <I>lumpenproletariat </I>of
      Greece and Rome with the proletariat of the present day. This confusion is
      useful to the bourgeoisie in its effort to demonstrate the enduring power
      of capitalism and the futility of the slave uprisings in Rome, from which
      it augurs the futility of present-day proletarian uprisings. And yet, the
      Roman &quot;proletarians&quot; had nothing in common with the present-day
      workers, and the Roman merchants had very little similarity with the
      capitalists of our time. The whole structure of life was different. It is
      therefore easy to see that the course of change must then have been
      different. Marx says : &quot;Every historical period has laws of its own .
      . . . As soon as society has outlived a given period of development, and
      is passing over from one given stage to another, it begins to be subject
      also to other laws.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#3" NAME="3b">3)</A></SUP>
      For sociology, which is social science in its most general form, dealing
      not with the individual forms of society, but with society in general,
      this law is very important as a guide for the specific social sciences,
      for all of which sociology, as we have seen, constitutes a method.</P>
    
    <P><I>In the second place, each form must be studied in its internal
      process of change. </I>We are not dealing, first, with a single form of
      social structure, perfect and immutable, and succeeded by another equal
      immutable form. In society, it is untrue - for instance - that capitalism
      continues throughout its entire period in unchanged form, to be succeeded
      by an equal unchanging socialism. As a matter of fact, each specific form
      is constantly undergoing change throughout the period of its existence. It
      has passed through a number of stages in its development: trading
      capitalism, industrial, financial capitalism with its imperialist policy,
      state capitalism during the world war. Nor did the nature of the case
      remain uniform within each of these stages; it would then have been
      impossible for one stage to yield place to another. Indeed, each preceding
      stage was a preparation for the following stage; during the period of
      industrial capitalism, for example, the process of concentration of
      capital was going on. On this foundation financial capital with its trusts
      and banks was built up.</P>
    
    <P><I>In the third place, each form of society must be considered in its
      growth and in its necessary disappearance, </I>i.e., <I>in its relation
      with other forms. </I>No form of society descends from heaven; each is a
      necessary consequence of the preceding social state; often it is difficult
      to discern the boundaries between them, the termination of one, the
      beginning of the other; one period overlaps the other. Historical epochs
      are not rigid and immovable units, like physical objects; they are
      processes, current forms of life, subject to constant change. In order to
      trace properly any such form of society we must go back to its roots in
      the past, follow the causes of its growth, all the conditions of its
      formation, the motive forces of its development. And it is also necessary
      to study the causes of its inevitable destruction, the tendencies which
      necessarily involve the disappearance of this form and prepare the
      introduction of the next form. Each stage is thus a link in the chain; it
      is connected with a link behind it and a link ahead of it. Even though
      bourgeois scholars may admit this fact as far as the past is concerned, it
      is impossible for them to grant it with regard to the present: capitalism
      will not perish. They are willing to go so far as to trace the roots of
      capitalism, but they are afraid to think of the conditions that lead
      capitalism to its destruction. &quot;This blindness constitutes all the
      wisdom of present-day economists, who teach the permanence and harmony of
      the existing social relations.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#4" NAME="4b">4)</A></SUP>
      Capitalism evolved from medieval feudal conditions owing to the growth of
      the commodities system. Capitalism is passing into communism through the
      dictatorship of the proletariat. Only by tracing the connections of
      capitalism with the preceding system, and its necessary transformation
      into communism, can we understand this form of society. Every other form
      of society must be studied from the same point of view; this is one of the
      demands of the dialectic method, which may also be called &quot;the
      historical point of view&quot;, since it regards each form of society <I>not
      as permanent, </I>but <I>as an historical stage, </I>appearing at a
      certain moment in history, and similarly disappearing.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This historicism of Marx has nothing in common with the
      so called &quot;historical school&quot; in jurisprudence and political
      economy. This reactionary school finds its principal task in proving the
      slowness of all changes, and in defending any bit of antiquated gossip
      that is &quot;hallowed by age&quot;. Heinrich Heine already said
      concerning this school:</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">To guard the &quot;sacred traditions&quot; is an
      imperative necessity for the bourgeoisie. It is for this reason,
      particularly, that phenomena that owe their origin to a specific
      historical stage are considered to be eternal, to have been handed down by
      God, and therefore insurmountable. We shall take three examples.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">I.<I> The State. </I>We now know that the state is a
      class organization, that there cannot be a state without classes, that a
      classless state is a round square, that the state could not arise until a
      certain stage in human evolution had been reached. But listen to the
      bourgeois historians, even the best of them! Eduard Meyer says: &quot;How
      far the formation of organic groups can proceed in the case of animals, I
      often had occasion to observe, thirty years ago, in Constantinople, in the
      case of the street dogs; they were organized in sharply distinct quarters,
      into which they would admit no outside dogs, and every evening all the
      dogs of each quarter gather in an empty lot for a meeting of about half an
      hour, in which they bark loudly. We may therefore actually speak of dog
      <I>states </I>of definite outline in space.&quot; (Eduard Meyer: <I>Geschichte
      des Altertums</I>, vol. i, first half, 3d ed., p.7,) It will
      therefore not surprise us to find Meyer accepting the state as a necessary
      property of human society. If even dogs have states (and therefore, of
      course, laws, justice, etc.), how could men get along without one?</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">II.<I> Capital. </I>On this subject the bourgeois
      economists show the same idiosyncrasies. It is well known that capital has
      not always existed, nor capitalism either. Capitalists and workers are a
      phenomenon of historical growth, by no means eternal. But the bourgeois
      scholars always defined capital as if it - and also the capitalist regime
      - had existed from all time. Thus, Torrens wrote: &quot;In the first stone
      which he (the savage) flings at the wild animal he pursues, in the stick
      that he seizes to strike down the fruit which hangs beyond his reach, we
      see the appropriation of one article for the purpose of aiding in the
      acquisition of another, and thus discover the origin of capital.&quot;
      (Marx <I>Capital</I>, vol. i, Chicago, 1915, p.205, footnote.) The monkey
      beating nuts out of a tree is therefore a capitalist (but without workers
      !). Modern economists are not much better; in order to prove the eternity
      of the state power, these poor wretches are obliged to endow their dogs
      with the capacities of Lloyd George and their monkeys with those of the
      Rothschilds!</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">III.<I> Imperialism. </I>Bourgeois scholars who take
      up this question often define imperialism as the effort at expansion in
      any form of life. Of course, imperialism is the policy of financial
      capital, and financial capital itself did not arise as a dominating
      economic form until the end of the Nineteenth Century. Little the
      bourgeois scholars care about that! In order to show that &quot;things
      have ever been thus&quot;, they elevate the chicken which picks up kernels
      into an imperialist, since it &quot;annexes&quot; these kernels! The dog
      state, the capitalist ape and the imperialist chicken are an excellent
      indication of the level of modern bourgeois science.</FONT></P>

    <H4>e. The Use of Contradictions in the Historical Process</H4>
    
    <P>The basis of all things is therefore the law of change, the law of
      constant motion. Two philosophers particularly (the ancient Heraclitus and
      the modern Hegel, as we have already seen) formulated this law of change,
      but they did not stop there. They also set up the question of the manner
      in which the process operates. The answer they discovered was that changes
      are produced by constant internal contradictions, internal struggle. Thus,
      Heraclitus declared: &quot;Conflict is the mother of all happenings,&quot;
      while Hegel said: &quot;Contradiction is the power that moves things.&quot;</P>
    
    <P>There is no doubt of the correctness of this law. A moment's thought
      will convince the reader. For, if there were no conflict, no clash of
      forces, the world would be in a condition of unchanging, stable
      equilibrium, <I>i.e., </I>complete and absolute permanence, a state of
      rest precluding all motion. Such a state of rest would be conceivable only
      in a system whose component parts and forces would be so related as not to
      permit of the introduction of any conflicts, as to preclude all mutual
      interaction, all disturbances. As we already know that all things change,
      all things are &quot;in flux&quot;, it is certain that such an absolute
      state of rest cannot possibly exist. We must therefore reject a condition
      in which there is no &quot;contradiction between opposing and colliding
      forces&quot;, no disturbance of equilibrium, but only an absolute
      immutability. Let us take up this matter somewhat more in detail.</P>
    
    <P>In biology, when we speak of adaptation, we mean that process by which
      one thing assumes a relation toward another thing that enables the two to
      exist simultaneously. An animal that is &quot;adapted&quot; to its
      environment is an animal that has achieved the means of living in that
      environment. It is suited to its surroundings, its qualities are such as
      to enable it to continue to live. The mole is &quot;adapted&quot; to
      conditions prevailing under the earth's surface; the fish, to conditions
      in the water; either animal transferred to the other's environment will
      perish at once.</P>
    
    <P>A similar phenomenon may be observed also in so called &quot;inanimate&quot;
      nature: the earth does not fall into the sun, but revolves around it &quot;without
      mishap&quot;. The relation between the solar system: and the universe
      which surrounds it, enabling both to exist side by side, is a similar
      relation. In the latter case we commonly speak, not of the adaptation, but
      of the equilibrium between bodies, or systems of such bodies, etc. We may
      observe the same state of things in society. Whether we like it or not,
      society lives within nature: is therefore in one way or another in
      equilibrium with nature. And the various parts of society, if the latter
      is capable of surviving, are so adapted to each other as to enable them to
      exist side by side: capitalism, which included both capitalists and
      workers, had a very long existence!</P>
    
    <P>In all these examples it is clear that we are dealing with one
      phenomenon, that of <I>equilibrium. </I>This being the case, where do the
      contradictions come in? For there is no doubt that conflict is a <I>disturbance
      </I>of equilibrium. It must be recalled that such equilibrium as we
      observe in nature and in society is <I>not </I>an absolute, unchanging
      equilibrium, but an equilibrium in flux, which means that the equilibrium
      may be established and destroyed, may be reestablished on a new basis, and
      again disturbed.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The precise conception of equilibrium is about as
      follows: &quot;We say of a system that it is in a state of equilibrium
      when the system cannot of itself, <I>i.e., </I>without supplying energy
      to it from without, emerge from this state.&quot; If - let us say - forces
      are at work on a body, neutralizing each other, that body is in a state of
      equilibrium; an increase or decrease in one of these forces will disturb
      the equilibrium.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">If the disturbance of equilibrium is of short duration
      and the body returns to its former position, the equilibrium is termed
      <I>stable; </I>if this does not ensue, the equilibrium is <I>unstable.
      </I>In the natural sciences we have mechanical equilibrium, chemical
      equilibrium, biological equilibrium. (Cf. H. von Halban: <I>Chemisches
      Gleichgewicht, </I>in <I>Handwörterbuch der Naturwissenschaften</I>,
      vol. ii, Jena, 1912, pp.470-519, from which we take the above
      quotation.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P>In other words, the world consists of forces, acting in many ways,
      opposing each other. These forces are balanced for a moment in exceptional
      cases only. We then have a state of &quot;rest&quot;, <I>i.e., </I>their
      actual &quot;conflict&quot; is concealed. But if we change only one of
      these forces, immediately the &quot;internal contradictions&quot; will be
      revealed, equilibrium will be disturbed, and if a new equilibrium is again
      established, it will be on a new basis, <I>i.e., </I>with a new
      combination of forces, etc. It follows that the &quot;conflict&quot;, the &quot;contradiction&quot;,
      i.e., the antagonism of forces acting in various directions, determines
      the motion of the system.</P>
    
    <P>On the other hand, we have here also the form of this process: in the
      first place, the condition of equilibrium; in the second place, a
      disturbance of this, equilibrium; in the third place, the reestablishment
      of equilibrium on a <I>new </I>basis. And then the story begins all over
      again: the new equilibrium is the point of departure for a new
      disturbance, which in turn is followed by another state of equilibrium,
      etc., <I>ad infinitum. </I>Taken all together, we are dealing with a
      process of motion based on the development of internal contradictions.</P>
    
    <P>Hegel observed this characteristic of motion and expressed it in the
      following manner: he called the original condition of equilibrium the <I>thesis,
      </I>the disturbance of equilibrium the <I>antith</I>esis, the
      reestablishment of equilibrium on a new basis the synthesis (the unifying
      proposition reconciling the contradictions). The characteristic of motion
      present in all things, expressing itself <I>in </I>this tripartite
      formula (or triad) he called <I>dialectic</I>.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The word &quot;dialectics&quot; among the ancient
      Greeks meant the art of eloquence, of disputation. The course of a
      discussion is as follows: one man says one thing, another the opposite (&quot;negates&quot;
      what the first man said); finally, &quot;truth is born from the struggle&quot;,
      and includes a part of the first man's statement and a part of the second
      man's (synthesis). Similarly, in the process of thought. Since Hegel,
      being an idealist, regards everything as a self-evolution of the spirit,
      he of course did not have any disturbances of equilibrium in mind, and the
      properties of thought as a spiritual and original thing were therefore, in
      his mind, properties also of being. Marx wrote in this connection: &quot;My
      dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its
      direct opposite. To Hegel, the life-process of the human brain, i.e., the
      process of thinking, which, under the name of `the Idea', he even
      transforms into an independent subject, is the demiurgos of the real
      world, and the real world is only the external phenomenal form of `the
      Idea'. With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the
      material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of
      thought . . . . With him (Hegel) it (dialectics) is standing on its head.
      It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational
      kernel within the mystical shell&quot; (<I>Capital, </I>Chicago, 1915,
      vol. i, p.25). For Marx, dialectics means evolution by means of
      contradictions, particularly, a law of &quot;being&quot;, a law of the
      movement of matter, a law of motion in nature and society. It finds its
      expression in the process of thought. It is necessary to use the dialectic
      method, the dialectic mode of thought, because the dialectics of nature
      may thus be grasped.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is quite possible to transcribe the &quot;mystical&quot;
      (as Marx put it) language of the Hegelian dialectics into the language of
      modern mechanics. Not so long ago, almost all Marxians objected to the
      mechanical terminology, owing to the persistence of the ancient conception
      of the atom as a detached isolated particle. But now that we have the
      Electron Theory, which represents atoms as complete solar systems, we have
      no reason to shun this mechanical terminology. The most advanced
      tendencies of scientific thought in all fields accept this point of view.
      Marx already gives hints of such a formulation (the doctrine of
      equilibrium between the various branches of production, the theory of
      labor value based thereon, etc.).</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Any object, a stone, a living thing, a human society, etc., may be
      considered as a whole consisting of parts (elements) related with each
      other; in other words, this whole may be regarded as a <I>system. </I>And
      no such system exists in empty space; it is surrounded by other natural
      objects, which, with reference to it, may be called the <I>environment.
      </I>For the tree in the forest, the environment means all the other trees,
      the brook, the earth, the ferns, the grass, the bushes, together with all
      their properties. Man's environment is society, in the midst of which he
      lives; the environment of human society is external nature. There is a
      constant relation between environment and system, and the latter, in turn,
      acts upon the environment. We must first of all investigate the
      fundamental question as to the nature of the relations between the
      environment and the system; how are they to be defined; what are their
      forms; what is their significance for their system. Three chief types of
      such relations may be distinguished.</P>
    
    <P>1.<I> Stable equilibrium. </I>This is present when the mutual action of
      the environment and the system results in an unaltered condition, or in a
      disturbance of the first condition which is again reestablished in the
      original state. For example, let us consider a certain type of animals
      living in the steppes. The environment remains unchanged. The quantity of
      food available for this type of beast neither increases nor decreases; the
      number of animals preying upon them also remains the same; all the 
      diseases, all the microbes (for all must be included in the &quot;environment&quot;),
      continue to exist in the original proportions. What will be the result?
      Viewed as a whole, the number of our animals will remain the same; some of
      them will die or be destroyed by beasts of prey, others will be born, but
      the given type and the given conditions of the environment will remain the
      same as they were before. This means a condition of rest due to an
      unchanged <I>relation </I>between the system (the given type of animals)
      and the environment, which is equivalent to stable equilibrium. Stable
      equilibrium is not always a complete absence of motion; there may be
      motion, but the resulting disturbance is followed by a reestablishment of
      equilibrium on the former basis. The contradiction between the environment
      and the system is constantly being reproduced <I>in the same quantitative
      relation.</I></P>
    
    <P>We shall find the case the same in a society of the stagnant type (we
      shall go into this question more in detail later). If the relation between
      society and nature remains the same; <I>i.e., </I>if society extracts
      from nature, by the process of production, precisely as much energy as it
      consumes, the contradiction between society and nature will again be
      reproduced in the former shape; the society will mark time, and there
      results a state of stable equilibrium.</P>
    
    <P>2. <I>Unstable equilibrium with positive </I>(<I>favorable</I>) <I>indication
      </I>(<I>an expanding system</I>). In actual fact, however, stable
      equilibrium does not exist. It constitutes merely an imaginary, sometimes
      termed the &quot;ideal&quot;, case. As a matter of fact, the relation
      between environment and the system is never reproduced in precisely the
      same proportions; the disturbance of equilibrium never actually leads to
      its reestablishment on exactly the same basis as before, but a new
      equilibrium is created on a new basis. For example, in the case of the
      animals mentioned above, let us assume that the number of beasts of prey
      opposing them decreases for some reason, while the available food
      increases. There is no doubt that the number of our animals would then
      also increase; our &quot;system&quot; will then grow; a new equilibrium is
      established on a better basis; this means <I>growth. </I>In other words,
      the contradiction between the environment and the system has become
      quantitatively different.</P>
    
    <P>If we consider human society, instead of these animals, and assume that
      the relation between it and nature is altered in such manner that society
      - by means of production - extracts more energy from nature than is
      consumed by society (either the soil becomes more fruitful, or new tools
      are devised, or both), this society will <I>grow </I>and not merely mark
      time. The new equilibrium will in each case be actually new. The
      contradiction between society and nature will in each case be reproduced
      on a new and &quot;higher&quot; basis, a basis on which society will
      increase and develop. This is a case of unstable equilibrium with positive
      indication.</P>
    
    <P>3.<I> Unstable equilibrium with negative indication </I>(<I>a
      declining system</I>). Now let us consider the quite different
      case of a new equilibrium being established on a &quot;lower&quot; basis.
      Let us suppose, for example, that the quantity of food available to our
      beasts has decreased, or that the number of beasts of prey has for some
      reason increased. Our animals will die out. The equilibrium between the
      system and the environment will in each case be established on the basis
      of the extinction of a portion of this system. The contradiction will be
      reestablished on a new basis, with a negative indication. Or, in the case
      of society, let us assume that the relation between it and nature has been
      altered in such manner that society is obliged to consume more and more
      and obtain less and less (the soil is exhausted, technical methods become
      poorer, etc.). New equilibrium will here be established in each case on a
      lowered basis, by reason of the destruction of a portion of society. We
      are now dealing with a declining society, a disappearing system, in other
      words, with motion having a negative indication.</P>
    
    <P>Every conceivable case will fall under one of these three heads. At the
      basis of the motion, as we have seen, there is in fact the contradiction
      between the environment and the system, which is constantly being
      reestablished.</P>
    
    <P>But the matter has another phase also. Thus far we have spoken only of
      the contradictions between the environment and the system, <I>i.e., </I>the
      <I>external </I>contradictions. But there are also internal
      contradictions, those that are within the system. Each system consists of
      its component parts (elements), united with each other in one way or
      another. Human society consists of people; the forests, of trees and
      bushes; the pile of stones, of the various stones; the herd of animals, of
      the individual animals, etc. Between them there are a number of
      contradictions, differences, imperfect adaptations, etc. In other words,
      here also there is no absolute equilibrium. If there can be, strictly
      speaking, no absolute equilibrium between the environment and the system,
      there can also be no such equilibrium between the elements of the system
      itself.</P>
    
    <P>This may be seen best by the example of the most complicated system,
      namely, human society. Here we encounter an endless number of
      contradictions; we find the struggle between classes, which is the
      sharpest expression of &quot;social contradictions&quot;, and we know that
      &quot;the struggle between classes is the motive force of history&quot;.
      The contradictions between the classes, between groups, between ideals,
      between the quantity of labor performed by individuals and the quantity of
      goods distributed to them, the planlessness in production (the capitalist
      &quot;anarchy&quot; in production), all these constitute an endless chain
      of contradictions, all of which are within the system and grow out of its
      contradictory <I>structure </I>(&quot;structural contradictions&quot;).
      But these contradictions do not of themselves destroy society. They <I>may
      </I>destroy it (if, for example, both opposing classes in a civil war
      destroy each other), but it is also possible they may at times not destroy
      it.</P>
    
    <P>In the latter case, there will be an unstable equilibrium between the
      various elements of society. We shall later discuss the nature of this
      equilibrium; for the present we need not go into it. But we must not
      regard society stupidly, as do so many bourgeois scholars, who overlook
      its internal contradictions. On the contrary, a scientific consideration
      of society requires that we consider it from the point of view of the
      contradictions present within it. <I>Historical &quot;growth&quot; is the
      development of contradictions.</I></P>
    
    <P>We must again point out a fact with which we shall have to deal more
      than once in this book. We have said that these contradictions are of two
      kinds: between the environment and this system, and between the elements
      of the system and the system itself. Is there any relation between these
      two phenomena? A moment's thought will show us that such a relation
      exists.</P>
    
    <P>It is quite clear that the internal structure of the system (its
      internal equilibrium) must change together with the relation existing
      between the system and its environment. The latter relation is the
      decisive factor; for the entire situation of the system, the fundamental
      forms of its motion (decline, prosperity, or stagnation) are determined by
      this relation only.</P>
    
    <P>Let us consider the question in the following form: we have seen above
      that the character of the equilibrium between society and nature
      determines the fundamental course of the motion of society. Under these
      circumstances, could the internal structure continue for long to develop
      in the opposite direction? Of course not. In the case of a growing
      society, it would not be possible for the internal structure of society to
      continue <I>constantly </I>to grow worse. If, in <I>a condition of
      growth, </I>the structure of society should become poorer, <I>i.e., </I>its
      internal disorders grow worse, this would be equivalent to the appearance
      of a new contradiction: a contradiction between the external and the
      internal equilibrium, which would require the society, if it is to
      continue growing, to undertake a reconstruction, <I>i.e., </I>its
      internal structure must adapt itself to the character of the external
      equilibrium. Consequently, <I>the internal (structural) equilibrium is a
      quantity which depends on the external equilibrium </I>(<I>is a &quot;function&quot;
      of this external equilibrium</I>).</P>

    <H4>f. The Theory of Cataclysmic Changes anal the Theory of Revolutionary
    Transformations in the Social Sciences</H4>
    
    <P>We have now to consider the final phase of the dialectic method, namely,
      the theory of sudden changes. No doubt it is a widespread notion that &quot;nature
      makes no sudden jumps&quot; <I>(natura non facit saltus</I>). This wise
      saying is often applied in order to demonstrate &quot;irrefutably&quot;
      the impossibility of revolution, although revolutions have a habit of
      occurring in spite of the moderation of our friends the professors. Now,
      is nature really so moderate and considerate as they pretend?</P>
    
    <P>In his <I>Science of Logic </I>(<I>Wissenschaft der Logik</I>)<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#5" NAME="5b">5)</A></SUP>,
      Hegel says: &quot;It is said that there are no sudden changes in nature,
      and the common view has it <I>(meint) </I>that when we speak of a growth
      or a destruction <I>(Entstehen oder Vergehen), </I>we always imagine a
      <I>gradual </I>growth <I>(Hervorgehen) </I>or disappearance <I>(Verschwinden).
      </I>Yet we have seen cases in which the alteration of existence <I>(des
      Seins) </I>involves not only a transition from one proportion to other,
      but also a transition, by a sudden leap, into a <I>quantitatively</I>,
      and, on the other hand, also <I>qualitatively </I>different thing (<I>Anderswerden</I>.);
      an interruption of the gradual process <I>(ein Abbrechen des Allmählichen),
      </I>differing qualitatively from the preceding, the former, state&quot;
      (the italics are mine. - N. B.).</P>
    
    <P>Hegel speaks of a transition of quantity into quality; there is very
      simple illustration of such a transition. If we should heat w ater, we
      should find that throughout the process of heating, before a temperature
      of 100 C. is reached, the water will not boil and turn into steam.
      Portions of the water will move faster and faster, but they will not
      bubble on the surface in the form of steam. The change thus far is merely
      <I>quantitative</I>; the water moves faster, the temperature rises, but
      the water remains water, having all the properties of water. Its quantity
      is changing having its quality remains the same. But when we have heated
      it to 100 C, we have brought it to the &quot;boiling-point&quot;. At once
      it begins to boil, at once the particles that have been madly in motion
      burst apart and leap from the surface in the form of little explosions of
      <I>steam. </I>The water has ceased to be water; it becomes <I>steam,
      </I>a gas. The former quality is lost; we now have a new quality, with new
      properties. We have thus learned two important peculiarities in the
      process of change.</P>
    
    <P>In the first place, having reached a certain stage in motion, the
      quantitative changes call forth qualitative changes (or, in more
      abbreviated form, &quot;quantity becomes quality&quot;) ; in the second
      place, this transition from quantity to quality is accomplished in a
      sudden leap, which constitutes an interruption in the gradual continuous
      process. The water was not constantly changing, with gradual
      deliberateness, into a little steam at a time, with the quantity of steam
      <I>constantly </I>increasing. For a long time it did not boil at all. But
      having reached the &quot;boiling-point&quot;, it began to boil. We must
      consider this a <I>sudden </I>change.</P>
    
    <P>The transformation of quantity into quality is one of the fundamental
      laws in the motion of matter ; it may be traced literally at every step
      both in nature and society. Hang a weight at the end of a string, and
      gradually add slight additional weights, each being as small as you like;
      up to a certain limit, the string will hold&quot;. But once this limit has
      been exceeded, it will suddenly break. Force steam into a boiler; all will
      go well for a while; only the pressure indicator will show increases in
      the pressure of the steam against the walls of the boiler. But when the
      dial has exceeded a certain limit, the boiler will explode. The pressure
      of the steam exceeded perhaps by a very little the power of resistance
      offered by the walls of the boiler. Before this moment, the quantitative
      changes had not led to a &quot;cataclysm&quot;, to a <I>qualitative </I>change,
      but at that &quot;point&quot; the boiler exploded.</P>
    
    <P>Several men are unable to lift a stone. Another joins them; they are
      still unable to do it. A weak old woman joins them - and their united
      strength raises the stone. Here, but a slight additional force was needed,
      and as soon as this force was added the job was done. Let us take another
      example. Leo Tolstoi wrote a story called &quot;Three Rolls and a Cookie&quot;.
      The point of the story is the following: a man, to appease his hunger, ate
      one roll after another, for each still left him hungry; in fact, after his
      third roll, he was still hungry; then he ate a little cookie, and his
      hunger was appeased. He then cursed his folly for not having eaten the
      cookie first: for then he would not have had to eat the rolls. Of course,
      we are aware of his mistake; we are dealing here with a <I>qualitative
      </I>change, the transition from the feeling of hunger to that of
      satiation, which transition was accomplished in one bound (after eating
      the cookie). But this qualitative difference <I>ensued after the
      quantitative differences: </I>the cookie would have been of no use without
      the rolls.</P>
    
    <P>We thus find that it is foolish to deny the existence changes, and to
      admit only a deliberate gradual process. Sudden leaps are often found in
      nature, and the notion that nature permits of no such violent alterations
      is merely a reflection of the fear of such shifts in society, <I>i.e.,
      </I>of the fear of revolution.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is a characteristic fact that the earlier theories
      of the bourgeoisie, touching the question of the creation of the universe,
      were catastrophic theories, though naive and wrong ones. Such, for
      instance, was Cuvier's theory. This was displaced by the evolution theory,
      which introduced many new elements, but one-sidedly denied cataclysmic
      changes. Of such nature are the works of Lyell (<I>Principles of Geology</I>),
      in the field of geology. But at the end of the last century there again
      arose a theory which recognized the importance of sudden changes. For
      instance, the botanist De Vries (the so called <I>mutation</I> theory)
      maintained that from time to time, on the basis of previous changes,
      sudden alterations of form ensue, which later fortify themselves and
      become the starting paints of new courses of evolution. The older views,
      which were hostile to &quot;sudden changes&quot;, are now no longer
      sufficient. Such notions (Leibnitz, for instance, says: &quot;Everything
      in nature goes step by step, never by leaps and bounds&quot; - <I>tout va
      par degrés dans la nature et rien par saut</I>) evidently arose on
      a conservative social soil.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The denial of the contradictory character of evolution by bourgeois
      scholars is based on their fear of the class struggle and on their
      concealment of social contradictions. Their fear of sudden changes is
      based on their fear of revolution; all their wisdom is contained in the
      following reasoning: there are no violent changes in nature, there cannot
      be any such violent changes anywhere; therefore, you proletarians, do not
      dare make a revolution! Yet here it becomes exceptionally evident that
      bourgeois science is in contradiction with the most fundamental
      requirements of all science. Everybody knows that there have been many
      revolutions in human society. Will anyone deny that there was an English
      Revolution, or a French Revolution, or a Revolution of 1848, or the
      Revolution of 1917? If these violent changes have taken place in society,
      and are still taking place, science should not &quot;deny&quot; them,
      refusing to recognize facts, but should <I>understand </I>these sudden
      shifts, and <I>explain </I>them.</P>
    
    <P>Revolutions in society are of the same character as the violent changes
      in nature. They do not suddenly &quot;fall from the sky&quot;. They are
      prepared by the entire preceding course of development, as the boiling of
      water is prepared by the preceding process of heating or as the explosion
      of a steam-boiler is prepared by the increasing pressure of the steam
      against its walls. A revolution in society means its reconstruction, &quot;a
      structural alteration of the system&quot;. Such a revolution is an
      inevitable consequence of the contradictions between the structure of
      society and the demands for its development. We shall discuss the nature
      of this process below. For the present we need only to know the following:
      in society, as in nature, violent changes do take place; in society, as in
      nature, these sudden changes are prepared by the preceding course of
      things; in other words, in society as in nature, evolution (gradual
      development) leads to revolution (sudden change) : &quot;The violent
      changes presuppose a preceding evolution, and the gradual changes lead to
      violent changes. These are two necessary factors in a single process.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#6" NAME="6b">6)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The contradictory nature of evolution, the question of
      cataclysmic changes, is one of the most essential theoretical questions.
      Though a great number of bourgeois schools and tendencies oppose teleology
      and favor determinism, etc., they nevertheless stumble on these questions.
      The Marxian theory is not a theory of evolution but of revolution. For
      this very reason it is inacceptable to the ideologists of the bourgeoisie,
      and they are therefore ready to &quot;accept&quot; the whole theory except
      its revolutionary dialectics. Objections to Marxism usually assume the
      same form. Thus, Werner Sombart, a German professor, treats Marx with
      great respect where evolution is involved, but at once attacks him as soon
      as he scents theoretically the revolutionary elements of Marxism. Entire
      theories are even built up, showing that Marx was a scholar in his
      evolutionary point of view, but ceased to be a scholar when he became -
      even theoretically - a revolutionist; he then leaves the sphere of science
      and gives himself up to revolutionary passions. P. Struve, once a Marxian,
      author of the first manifesto of the Russian Social-Democracy, a man later
      metamorphosized into a protagonist of pogroms and a prime
      counter-revolutionary ideologist, also began by attacking Marxism in its
      theory of cataclysmic changes. Plekhanov, then a revolutionist, wrote- &quot;Mr.
      Struve wants to show us that nature makes no sudden leaps, and that the
      intellect (reason) will not bear such leaps. The fact is, Struve means his
      own intellect, which indeed <I>tolerates no leaps, </I>for the simple
      reason, as is said, that he <I>cannot bear a certain dictatorship:&quot;
      </I>(The italics are Plekhanov's; <I>Criticism of Our </I>Critics, p.99.)
      The so called &quot;organic school&quot;, the Positivists, Spencerians,
      evolutionists, etc., all oppose cataclysmic changes because they cannot
      bear a &quot;certain dictatorship&quot;</FONT>.</P>
