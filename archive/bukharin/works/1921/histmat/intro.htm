    <H4>a. The Social Sciences and the Demands of the Struggle of the Working
    Class</H4>
    
    <P>Bourgeois scholars speak of any branch of learning with mysterious awe,
      as if it were a thing produced in heaven, not on earth. But as a matter of
      fact any science, whatever it be, grows out of the demands of society or
      its classes. No one takes the trouble to count the number of flies on a
      window-pane, or the number of sparrows in the street, but one does count
      the number of horned cattle. The former figures are useful to no one; it
      is very useful to know the latter. But it is not only useful to have a
      knowledge of nature, from whose various parts we obtain all our
      substances, instruments, raw materials, etc,; it is just as necessary, in
      practice, to have information concerning society. The working class, at
      each step in its struggle, is brought face to face with the necessity of
      possessing such information. In order to be able to conduct its struggle
      with other classes properly, it is necessary for the working class to
      foresee how these classes will behave. For this it must know on what
      circumstances the conduct of the various classes, under varying
      conditions, depends. Before the working class obtains power, it is obliged
      to live under the yoke of capital and to bear in mind constantly, in its
      struggle for liberation, what will be the behavior of all the given
      classes. It must know on what this behavior depends, and by what such
      behavior is determined. This question may be answered only by social
      science. If the working class has conquered power, it is under the
      necessity of struggling against the capitalist governments of other
      countries, as well as against the remnants of counter-revolution at home;
      and 'it is also obliged to reckon with the extremely difficult tasks. of
      the organization of production and distribution. What is to be the nature
      of the economic plan; how is the intelligentsia to be utilized; how are
      the peasantry and the petty bourgeoisie to be trained to communism. how
      shall experienced administrators be raised from the ranks of the workers;
      how shall the broad masses of the working class itself, as yet only
      slightly class-conscious, be reached; etc., etc., - all these questions
      require a knowledge of society in order to answer them properly, a
      knowledge of its classes, of their peculiarities, of their behavior in
      this case or that; they require a knowledge also of political economy and
      the social currents of thought of the various groups in society. These
      questions show the need for the social sciences. The practical task of a
      reconstruction of society may be correctly solved by the application of a
      scientific policy of the working class, <I>i.e., </I>a policy based on
      scientific theory; this scientific theory, in the case of the proletarian,
      is the theory founded by Karl Marx. </P>
    
    <P><A NAME="b"></A></P>
    
    <H4>b. The Bourgeoisie and the Social Sciences </H4>
    
    <P>The bourgeoisie also has created its own social sciences, based on its
      own practical requirements.</P>
    
    <P>When the bourgeoisie is the ruling class, it must solve a great number
      of questions: how to maintain the capitalist order of things; how to
      secure the so called &quot;normal development&quot; of capitalist society,
      which means a regular influx of profits; how to organize for this purpose
      its economic institutions; how to conduct its policy with regard to other
      countries; how to maintain its rule over the working class; how to
      eliminate disagreements in its own ranks; how to train its staffs of
      officials: priests, police, scholars; how to carry on the business of
      instruction so that the working class may not become savage and destroy
      the machinery, but may continue to be obedient to its oppressors, etc.</P>
    
    <P>For this purpose the bourgeoisie needs the social sciences; these
      sciences aid it in its adaptation to the complicated social life and in
      choosing a proper course in the solution of the practical problems of
      life. It is interesting, for example, to note that the first bourgeois
      economists were great practical merchants and government leaders, while
      the greatest theoretician of the bourgeoisie, Ricardo, was a very able
      banker.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="c"></A></P>
    
    <H4>c. The Class Character of the Social Sciences</H4>
    
    <P>Bourgeois scholars always maintain that they are the representatives of
      so called &quot;pure science&quot;, that all earthly sufferings, all
      conflicting interests, all the ups and downs of life, the hunt for profit,
      and other earthly and vulgar things have no relation whatever with their
      science. Their conception of the matter is approximately the following:
      the scholar is a god, seated on a sublime eminence, observing
      dispassionately the life of society in all its varying forms; they think
      (and yet more loudly proclaim) that vile &quot;practice&quot; has no
      relation whatever with pure &quot;theory&quot;. This conception is of
      course a false one; quite the contrary is true: all learning arises from
      practice. This being the case, it is perfectly clear that the social
      sciences have a class character. Each class has its own practice, its
      special tasks, its interests and therefore its view of things. The
      bourgeoisie is concerned chiefly with safeguarding, perpetuating,
      solidifying, extending the rule of capital. The working class is concerned
      in the first place with the task of overthrowing the capitalist system and
      safeguarding the rule of the working class in order to reconstruct life.
      It is not difficult to see that bourgeois practice will demand one thing,
      and proletarian practice another; that the bourgeoisie will have one view
      of things, and the working class another; that the social science of the
      bourgeoisie will be of one type, and that of the proletariat
      unquestionably of a different type.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="d"></A></P>
    
    <H4>d. Why is Proletarian Science Superior to Bourgeois Science?</H4>
    
    <P>This is the question we have now to answer. If the social sciences have
      a class character, in what way is proletarian science superior to
      bourgeois science, for the working class also has its interests, its
      aspirations, its practice, while the bourgeoisie has a practice of its
      own. Both classes must be considered as interested parties. It is not
      sufficient to say that one class is good, highminded, concerned with the
      welfare of humanity, while the other is greedy, eager for profits, etc.
      One of these two classes has one kind of eye-glasses, red ones, the other
      class has a different kind, white ones. Why are red glasses better than
      white ones? Why is it better to look at reality through red ones? Why is
      there superior visibility through red ones?</P>
    
    <P>We must approach the answer to this question rather carefully.</P>
    
    <P>We have seen that the bourgeoisie is interested in preserving the
      capitalist system. Yet it is a well-known fact that there is nothing
      permanent under the sun. There was a slavery system; there was a feudal
      system; there was, and still is, the capitalist system; there also have
      been other forms of human society. It is evident - and
      incontrovertibly so - that we must infer the following: he who would
      understand social life on its present basis must also understand, at the
      outset, that all is changing, that one form of society follows upon
      another. Let us picture to ourselves, for example, the feudal serf-owner,
      who lived in the period before the liberation of the peasants from
      serfdom. Such a man in many cases could not even imagine that there might
      exist an order of society in which it would be impossible to sell peasants
      or exchange them for greyhounds. Could such a serf-owner really understand
      the evolution of society correctly? Of course not. Why not? For the reason
      that his eyes were covered not by glasses, but with blinders. He could not
      see further than his nose, and therefore was unable to understand even the
      things going on right under his nose.</P>
    
    <P>The bourgeoisie also wears such blinders. The bourgeoisie is interested
      in the preservation of capitalism and believes in its permanence and
      indestructibility. It is therefore blind to such phenomena and such traits
      in the evolution of capitalist society as point to its temporary nature,
      to its approaching ruin (even to the possibility of its destruction), to
      its being succeeded by any other organization of life. This is made most
      clear by the example of the World War and the revolution. Did any one of
      the more or less prominent bourgeois scholars foresee the consequences of
      the world slaughter? Not one! Did any one of them foresee the outbreak of
      revolution? Not one! They were all busily occupied in supporting their
      bourgeois governments and predicting victory for the capitalists of their
      own country. And yet, these phenomena, namely, the general destruction by
      warfare, and the unprecedented revolution of the proletariat, are deciding
       the destinies of mankind, are changing the face of the entire earth. But
      of all this, bourgeois science had not a single premonition. But the
      communists-the representatives of proletarian science-did foresee all
      this. The difference is due to the fact that the proletariat is not
      interested in the preservation of the old and is therefore more
      farsighted.</P>
    
    <P>It is not difficult to understand now why proletarian social science is
      superior to bourgeois social science. It is superior because it has a
      deeper and wider vision of the phenomena of social life, because it is
      capable of seeing further and of observing facts that lie beyond the
      vision of bourgeois social science. It is therefore clear that Marxists
      have a perfect right to regard proletarian science as true and to demand
      that it be generally recognized.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="e"></A></P>
    
    <H4>e. The Various Social Sciences and Sociology</H4>
    
    <P>Human society is a very complicated thing; in fact, all social phenomena
      are quite complicated and varied. We have for instance the economic
      phenomena, the economic structure of society and its national
      organization; and the fields of morality, religion, art, learning,
      philosophy; and the domain of family relations, etc. These are often
      interwoven into very peculiar patterns, constituting the current of social
      life. It is of course clear that for an understanding of this complicated
      social life it is necessary to approach it from various starting points,
      to divide science into a group of sciences. One will study the economic
      life of society (science of economics) or even the special universal laws
      of capitalist economy (political economy) ; another will study law and the
      state and will go into special matters of detail; a third will study - let
      us say- morality, etc.</P>
    
    <P>And each of these branches of learning, in its turn, can be divided into
      two classes: one group of these sciences will investigate the past, a
      certain time in a certain place-this is historical science. For example,
      in the field of law: it is possible to investigate, and to describe
      precisely, how law and the state have developed, and how their forms have
      changed. This will be the <I>history</I> of law. But it is also possible
      to investigate and solve certain questions: what is law; under what
      conditions does it grow, or die out; on what do its forms depend; etc.
      This will be the <I>theory </I>of law. Such branches of learning are the
      <I>theoretical </I>branches.</P>
    
    <P>Among the social sciences there are two important branches which
      consider not only a single field of social life, but the entire social
      life in all its fulness; in other words, they are concerned not with any
      single set of phenomena (such as, economic, or legal, or religious
      phenomena, etc.), but take up the entire life of society, as a whole,
      concerning themselves with all the groups of social phenomena. One of
      these sciences is history; the other is sociology. In view of what has
      been said above it will not be difficult to grasp the difference between
      them. History investigates and describes how the current of social life
      flowed at a certain time and in a certain place (for example, how economy
      and law and morality and science, and a great number of other things,
      developed in Russia, beginning in 1700 and going down to 1800 ; or, in
      China, from 2000 B.C. to 1000 A.D.; or, in Germany, after the
      Franco-Prussian War in 1871; or in any other epoch and in any other
      country or group of countries). Sociology takes up the answer to general
      questions, such as: what is society? On what does its growth or decay
      depend? What is the relation of the various groups of social phenomena
      (economic, legal, scientific, etc.), with each other; how is their
      evolution to be explained; what are the historical forms of society; how
      shall we explain the fact that one such form follows upon another; etc.,
      etc.? Sociology is the most general (abstract) of the social sciences. It
      is often referred to under other names, such as: &quot;the philosophy of
      history&quot;, &quot;the theory of the historical process&quot;, etc.</P>
    
    <P>It is evident from the above what relation exists between history and
      sociology. Since sociology explains the general laws of human evolution,
      it serves as a <I>method </I>for history. If, for example, sociology
      establishes the general doctrine that the forms of government depend on
      the forms of economy, the historian must seek and find, in any given
      epoch, precisely what are the relations, and must show what is their
      concrete, specific expression. History furnishes the material for drawing
      sociological conclusions and making sociological generalizations, for
      these conclusions are not made up of whole cloth, but are derived from the
      actual facts of history. Sociology in its turn formulates a definite point
      of view, a means of investigation, or, as we now say, a <I>method </I>for
      history.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="f"></A></P>
    
    <H4>f. The Theory of Historical Materialism as a <I>Marxian Sociology</I></H4>
    
    <P>The working class has its own proletarian sociology, known as <I>historical
      materialism. </I>In its main outlines this theory was elaborated by Marx
      and Engels. It is also called &quot;the materialist method in history&quot;,
      or simply &quot;economic materialism&quot;. This profound and brilliant
      theory is the most powerful instrument of human thought and understanding.
      With its aid, the proletariat finds its bearings in the most complicated
      questions in social life and in the class struggle. With its aid,
      communists correctly predicted the war and the revolution and the
      dictatorship of the proletariat, as well as the conduct of the various
      parties, groups, and classes in the great transformation through which
      humanity is now passing. This book is devoted to expounding and developing
      this theory.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Some persons imagine that the theory of historical
      materialism should under no circumstances be considered a Marxian
      sociology, and that it should not be expounded systematically; they
      believe that it is only a living <I>method </I>of historical knowledge,
      that its truths may only be applied in the case of concrete and historical
      events. In addition, there is the argument that the conception of
      sociology itself is rather vague, that &quot;sociology&quot; signifies
      sometimes the science of primitive culture and the origin of the primitive
      forms of the human community (for instance, the family), and at other
      times extremely vague observations on the most varied social phenomena &quot;in
      general&quot;, and at still other times, an uncritical comparison of
      society with an organism (the organic, biological school of sociology),
      etc.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">All such arguments are in error. In the first place,
      the confusion prevailing in the bourgeois camp should not induce us to
      create still more confusion in our ranks. For the theory of historical
      materialism has a definite place, it is not political economy, nor is it
      history; it is the general theory of society and the laws of its
      evolution, <I>i.e</I>., sociology. In the second place, the fact that the
      theory of historical materialism is a method of history, by no means
      destroys its significance as a sociological theory. Very often a more
      abstract science may furnish a point of view (method) for the less
      abstract sciences. This is the case here also, as the matter in large type
      has shown.</FONT></P>
