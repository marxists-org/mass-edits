    <H4>a.The Process of Social Changes and the Productive Forces</H4>
    
    <P>The process of social changes is closely connected with changes in the
      condition of the productive forces. This movement of the productive
      forces, and the movement and regrouping of all social elements, involved
      in it, is nothing more nor less than a process of constant disturbance of
      social equilibrium, followed by reestablishments of equilibrium. Indeed, a
      progressive movement of the productive forces implies above all that a
      contradiction has arisen between the social technique and the social
      economy: the system loses its equilibrium. The productive forces have
      increased to certain extent; a certain regrouping of persons must be
      undertaken, for otherwise there is no equilibrium, <I>i.e., </I>the
      system cannot permanently endure in its present form. This contradiction'.
      eliminated by means of the following regrouping of men: economy &quot;adapts
      itself&quot; to the condition of the productive forces, to the social
      technology. But the regrouping of persons in the economic apparatus also
      implies a necessary regrouping of persons in the social-political
      structure of society (a different combination parties, a different
      alignment of the forces of the parties, etc.) Furthermore, the same
      condition necessarily demands a change in legal, moral, and all other
      standards. For the contradiction can be solved only in this way, or, what 
      amounts to the same thing, the equilibrium between the system of persons
      and the system of standards cannot be reestablished in any other way. The
      same true also of the entire psychology of society, as well as of its
      ideology. G. V. Plekhanov has brilliantly stated this: &quot;The origin,
      change, and destruction of the association of ideas, under influence of
      the origin, change and destruction of certain combina nations of social
      forces, to a predominant extent explain the history of ideology.&quot;
      <SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP> The new &quot;combination&quot;,
      <I>i.e., </I>the new relation between persons, comes in conflict with the
      old combination (the old associations of ideas). This means a destruction
      of the internal equilibrium, which is reestablished on a new basis, a new
      &quot;combination&quot; of ideas originates, <I>i.e., </I>where there is
      an adaptation on the part of the social psychology and the social
      ideology, which equilibrium is again disturbed, etc., etc.</P>
    
    <P>We now encounter a problem that is of immense theoretical and practical
      significance.</P>
    
    <P>We may conceive of the restoration of social equilibrium as proceeding
      in either of two ways: that of a gradual adaptation of the various
      elements in the social whole (evolution), and that of violent upheaval
      (revolution). We have seen from history that revolutions do sometimes
      occur; they are historical facts. It will be interesting to learn under
      what circumstances the adaptation of the various elements of society
      proceeds by evolution, and under what circumstances by revolution.</P>
    
    <P>This will involve a discussion of a number of other questions concerning
      the dynamics of society. We know, for instance, that any given society is
      constantly undergoing change, experiencing internal regroupings,
      alterations of form and content, etc. We know that this process is
      connected with the evolution of the productive forces. But we sometimes
      witness changes within the limits of the identical social-economic
      structure; and, at other times, a transition from one &quot;species&quot;
      of society to another, the substitution of one &quot;mode of production&quot;
      for another &quot;mode of production&quot;. When will the one result, and
      when the other?</P>
    
    <P>A general description of the process of social evolution is given by
      Marx in his A <I>Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</I>:</P>
    
    <P>&quot;At a certain stage of their development, the material forces of
      production in society come in conflict with the existing relations
      production, or - what is but a legal expression for the same thing - with
      the property relations within which they had been at work before. From
      forms of development of the forces of production these relations turn into
      their fetters. Then comes the period of social revolution. With the change
      of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or
      less rapidly transformed. In considering such transformations, the
      distinction should always be made between the material transformation of
      the economic conditions of production which can be determined with the
      precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious,
      aesthetic or philosophic - in short, ideological forms in which men become
      conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as our opinion of an
      individual is not based on what he thinks of himself, so can we not judge
      of such a period of transformation by its own consciousness; on the
      contrary, this consciousness must rather be explained from the
      contradictions of material life, from the existing conflict between the
      social forces of production and the relations of production&quot; <I>(A
      Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, </I>New York, 1904,
      p.12).</P>
    
    <P>Marx therefore conceives of revolution as intervening when the
      equilibrium between the productive forces of society and the foundations
      of its economic structure is disturbed; such is the content of the
      conflict solved by revolution; this; of course, means the transition from
      one form to another. But so long as the economic structure still permits
      the productive forces to evolve the social changes will not take the form
      of revolution; we shall here find evolution instead.</P>
    
    <P>This question will be taken up in detail later, but we shall now
      emphasize the following point. <I>According to Marx, the cause of
      revolution is not at all to be sought in a collision between economy' and
      law, as many critics of Marxism maintain, but in a collision between the
      productive forces and economy, </I>which is quite a different matter, as
      will be shown in the sequel.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="b"></A></P>
    
    <H4>b.The Productive Forces and the Social-Economic Structure.</H4>
    
    <P>We have stated that the cause of revolution, of a violent transition
      from one type to another, must be sought in a conflict proceeding between
      the productive forces, and their growth, on the one hand, and the economic
      structure of society, <I>i.e., </I>the production relations, on the other
      hand. The following objection might be raised: since the evolution of the
      production relations is conditioned by the movement of the productive
      forces, is not the constant alteration of the production relations in
      itself a result of the conflict between the productive forces and the
      antiquated production relations? If we take the example of the growth of
      productive forces in capitalistic society, we shall find that this growth
      has involved extensive regrouping of persons in the economic process. The
      old middle class melted away, the artisan class disappeared, the
      proletariat increased, great enterprises grew up. The human network of
      production was constantly changing. Further more, did not one form of
      capitalism lead into another; for instance, was not industrial capitalism
      followed by financial capitalism, entirely without revolution? Yet, all
      these changes were the expression of a constant disturbance of equilibrium
      (a conflict) between the productive forces and the production relations.
      While the productive forces were growing, they collided with the petty
      artisan conditions; this was a disturbance of equilibrium; the economy of
      the artisan was no longer compatible with the increasing technique. The
      lost equilibrium was again and again restored, already on a new basis, for
      the new economy was also increased, corresponding to the new technique. It
      therefore obviously follows that not <I>every conflict between the
      productive forces and the production relations results in revolution, </I>that
      the case is much more complicated than that. To determine which kinds of
      conflict produce a revolutionary crisis we must take up an analysis of the
      various kinds of production relations.</P>
    
    <P>Production relations are, of course, all kinds of relations between
      persons, arising in the process of the social economic life, <I>i.e</I>.,
      in the production process, which also includes the distribution of means
      of production, as well as in the process of the distribution of products.
      Of course, these production relations are of many kinds: a broker in
      Paris, who buys shares of a New York trust, is thus assuming a certain
      production relation to the workers and owners, the superintendents and
      engineers, of the factories belonging to this trust. The banker who
      employs bookkeepers stands in a certain production relation with them.
      Likewise, the joiner has certain production relations with the
      lathe-workers in the same factory, or with the fish-wife from whom he buys
      a herring, or with the foreman above him. But the same joiner also has
      certain relations with the fisherman who catches the herring, with the
      weaver who is one of the many persons concerned in the manufacture of his
      trousers, etc., etc. In short, we have a truly endless quantity of
      different and varied production relations, distinct from each other
      according to the type of relation. Our task therefore will be to
      differentiate between the various species of these relations, and to
      determine <I>what is the species </I>of production relations in which a
      conflict would lead to revolution.</P>
    
    <P>In order to have a sound actual basis for our answer, we must learn how
      revolutions have actually operated, i.e., in what manner they have solved
      the contradiction between the evolution of the productive forces and the
      economic basis of society. To be sure, this conflict has always been waged
      by men; the class struggle has been a hard one. What has been the outcome
      of the victorious revolution? First a <I>different political power</I>.
      Second a different place of classes in the process of production, a
      different <I>distribution of instruments of production, </I>which, as we
      know, are directly connected with the situation of the classes. In other
      words, the struggle during a revolution is waged for the control of the
      most important instruments of production, which in a class society in the
      hands of a class which consolidates its rule over things, and through
      them, over persons, by the additional power of its state organization.
      This leads us to the decisive point in our search for those production
      relations that require a revolution for their destruction, in order that
      society may continue to develop its productive forces. In the Third Volume
      of <I>Capital, </I>Marx categorically states the problem of the form of
      society and points out the <I>fundamental, </I>specific element in the
      total phenomenon of the productive relations: &quot;The <I>specific </I>economic
      form, in which unpaid surplus labor is pumped out of the direct producers,
      determines the relations of rulers and ruled, as it grows immediately out
      of production itself and reacts upon it as a determining element Upon this
      is founded the entire formation of the economic community which grows up
      out of the conditions of production itself, and this also determines its
      specific political shape. <I>It is always the direct relation of the
      owners of the conditions of production to the direct producers, </I>which
      reveals the innermost secret, the hidden foundation of <I>the entire
      social construction, and with it of the political form </I>of the
      relations between sovereignty and dependence, in short, of <I>the
      corresponding form of the state.</I>&quot; <SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#2" NAME="2b">2)</A></SUP>
      The matter therefore stands as follows: among all the varied production
      relations, one type of such relations stands foremost, namely the type
      that is expressive of the relations between the classes which hold the
      principal means of production in their hands, and the other classes which
      hold either subsidiary means or no such means at all. The class that is
      dominant in economy will also be dominant in politics and <I>will
      politically fortify </I>the specific type of production relations which
      will give security to the process of exploitation operating in favor of
      this class. &quot;Politics,&quot; to use; the expression found in one of
      the resolutions of the Ninth Congress of the Russian Communist Party, &quot;is
      the concentrated expression of economy.&quot;</P>
    
    <P>The same thing may be stated in somewhat different words. We have
      observed that not all the production relations are here concerned, but
      only of the economic domination supported by a specific relation to
      things, to instruments of production. In the language of the jurists, we
      are concerned here with fundamental &quot;property relations&quot;, with
      relations of <I>class property in the instruments of production. </I>These
      property relations are identical with the fundamental production
      relations; they are merely another way of saying the same thing, legally
      this time, instead of economically. And these relations are now associated
      also with the political domination of the specific class; they are
      maintained by this domination, fortified and extended at any price.</P>
    
    <P>Within this frame, all possible variations of &quot;evolutionary nature&quot;
      may take place; but we may pass beyond the frame only with the aid of a
      revolutionary upheaval. For example: within the limits of capitalist
      property relations, artisan trades may perish, new forms of capitalist
      enterprises may originate, capitalist organizations of unheard-of
      varieties may spring into being; individual members of the bourgeois
      classes may become bankrupt; individual members of the working class may
      become petty or even large-scale industrialists; new social strata (for
      instance, the so called &quot;new middle class&quot;, <I>i.e., </I>&quot;the
      technical mental workers&quot;) may grow up. But the working class cannot
      become the owner of the means of production, nor can it (or its
      representatives) secure command of production, or dispose of the most
      important instruments of production. In other words: however much the
      production relations may shift under the influence of the increasing
      productive forces, <I>their fundamental character remains the same. </I>If
      this fundamental character should come in conflict with the productive
      forces, it will break up. This is revolution, which affords a transition
      to another form of society. &quot;To the extent that the labor process is
      a simple process between man and nature, its simple elements remain the
      same in all social forms of development. But every definite historical
      form of this process develops more and more its material foundations and
      social forms. Whenever a certain maturity is reached, one definite social
      form is discarded and displaced by a higher one. The time for the coming
      of such a crisis is announced by the depth and breadth of the
      contradictions and antagonisms which separate the conditions of
      distribution, and with them the definite historical form of the
      corresponding conditions of production, from the productive forces, the
      productivity, and development of their agencies. A conflict then arises
      between the material development of production, and its social form.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#3" NAME="3b">3)</A></SUP>
    </P>
    
    <P>Revolution therefore occurs when there is an outright conflict between
      the increased productive forces, which can no longer be housed within the
      envelope of the production relations, and which constitutes the
      fundamental web of these production relations, <I>i.e</I>. property
      relations, ownership in the instruments of production. This envelope is
      then burst asunder.</P>
    
    <P>It is easy to see why this should be the case, why precisely <I>these
      </I>production relations should constitute the most immutable, the most
      conservative form: for they are the expression of the economic monopoly
      rule of a class, as affirmed and expressed in its political domination.
      And, of course, it is only natural that such an &quot;envelope&quot; as
      would express the fundamental interests of the class would be held
      together by this class to the bitter end, while alterations <I>within the
      envelope, </I>not disturbing the essential bases of the existing society,
      may and do proceed rather painlessly. It follows, among other things, that
      there are no &quot;purely political&quot; revolutions: every revolution is
      a social (class-displacing) revolution; and every social revolution is a
      political revolution. For the production relations cannot be overturned
      without also upsetting the political congelation of these relations; on
      the other hand, if the political power is broken, this also means the
      destruction of the domination of this class in economy, for &quot;politics
      is the concentrated expression of economy&quot;. Some persons consider
      that the French Revolution differs from the Russian Revolution in the
      sense that the former was a political revolution and the latter a social
      revolution. For, in the Bolshevik Revolution, politics and political
      changes did not play a greater role than in the French Revolution, while
      the alterations in the production relations were incomparably greater.</P>
    
    <P>This &quot;objection&quot; is merely a confirmation of the statements we
      have made above. Let us consider this question of the political phase. We
      all know that during the French Revolution the power passed from the hands
      of one set of owners into the hands of another set. The bourgeoisie
      destroyed the feudal commercial state and organized the state of the
      bourgeoisie. In Russia, on the other hand, the organization of all owners
      was swept away. The political upheaval went far deeper, corresponding to
      the deeper penetration of the displacement of the production relations
      (nationalization of industry, abolition of landed estates, beginnings of
      the socialist order of society, etc.).</P>
    
    <P>Therefore: <I>the cause of revolutions is the conflict between the
      productive forces and the productive relations, </I>as <I>solidified in
      the political organization of the ruling class. These production relations
      are so emphatic a brake on the evolution of the productive forces that
      they simply must be broken up if society is to continue to develop. If
      they cannot be burst asunder, they will prevent and stifle the unfolding
      of the productive forces, and the entire society will become stagnant or
      retrogressive, </I>i.e., <I>it will enter upon a period of decay.</I></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">From the above remarks, the reader will understand why
      society was able to transform itself, for instance, from the primitive
      communist condition, by way of evolution, into a patriarchal society, and
      then into a feudal society. Under primitive communism, there was no class
      rule over the means of production and no political power for the
      protection of such a rule. On the contrary, such rule, as well as the use
      of force, grew up by evolutionary process from the primitive communist
      production relations, owing to the growth of private property, etc. The
      productive forces expanded, accompanied by an increasing differentiation,
      an increasing experience on the part of the eldest of the clan, the
      development of private property, a segregation of the ruling class thus
      formed. Formerly, there had been no ruling class, no ruling power;
      therefore, there was nothing to be destroyed; therefore, the transition
      took place without a revolution.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">H. Cunow, who in his two-volume work reduces Marx to an
      innocent liberal lamb, writes the following concerning revolution: &quot;When
      Marx, accordingly, speaks in the above sentence of social conditions and
      social revolution (in his <i>Critique of Political Economy. N. B.</i>),
      he does not mean, as is suggested by others, a political fight for
      power, but the transformation of the social conditions of life following
      upon the blossoming forth of a new and altered mode of production&quot;.
      According to Marx's view, an alteration in the mode of production,
      particularly if the state government should seek to maintain by force the
      antiquated laws corresponding to an older stage in the economic relations,
      may lead to a political revolution or eruption of the masses of the
      people; but this need not necessarily be the case. The upheaval of the
      political and social conditions of life, as well as the ideologies,
      brought about by a change in the economic structure, may be achieved
      gradually <I>without uprisings and street battles </I>(for instance, by
      parliamentary methods).&quot; (Heinrich Cunow: <I>Die Maxsche
      Geschichts-Gesellschafts- und Staatstheorie, </I>Berlin 1921, vol. ii,
      p.315). The above quotations from the honorable Social-Democratic
      professor are a horrible example of the mental confusion of a
      vulgar-liberal eclectic. In fact, in the sentence in which Marx speaks of
      revolution, he considered its cause to be, as we have seen, the conflict
      <I>between the productive forces and the production relations. </I>The
      revolutionary solution of this conflict is precisely the breakdown of the
      production relations and the state forms expressing them. But in Cunow's
      mind, the new mode of production arises ready-made, Lord knows whence and
      how, perhaps <I>later </I>(!) leading to a political revolution. This is
      so gorgeous, so &quot;brilliant,&quot; that it is hard to keep up with it.
      Cunow considers the case of socialism somewhat as follows: capitalism will
      be peacably succeeded by the socialist mode of production; the capitalists
      in the government will observe this miracle and marvel thereat; and then
      they will begin, by the use of force (or perhaps without the use of force)
      to battle against the alterations already accomplished in the mode of
      production (<I>i.e., </I>they will begin - if we may put it thus -
      to demand their profits, which everyone has been forgetting). Then, not
      until then, an indignant nation, fighting behind barricades, will drive
      them out. This is a fine cartoon for a humorous weekly, but hardly
      material for a learned work. Cunow provides us with a great accumulation
      of erroneous views. In the first place, the essence of the conflict is not
      properly formulated (Cunow is here copying from Mr. P Struve, whose
      article in Braun's <I>Archiv </I>was brilliantly annihilated by G. V.
      Plekhanov years ago); in the second place, the actual phase of the
      revolutionary process are entirely distorted; in the third place,
      revolution itself disappears altogether from revolution. What is
      revolution which does not even involve a political upheaval? The preceding
      alteration in the mode of production here does not operate
      catastrophically, but quite cautiously; it is reflected in politics by
      parliamentary manipulations; that is all. Herr Cunow here relinquishes the
      Marxian theory as thoroughly and shamelessly as he has been relinquishing
      Marxian practice in the latter years. And this, at a time when even the
      stupidest bourgeois professors seem inclined to regard revolutions as
      phenomena which constantly arise, with a sort of inner necessity, from a
      given condition of society. (<I>Cf. Schriften der deutschen Gesellschaft

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">A brief examination of the causes of revolutions will
      be illuminating The bourgeois revolutions (the English Revolution of the
      Seventeenth Century, the French Revolution at the end of the Eighteenth)
      have been excellently characterized - in a few lines - by Marx: &quot;The
      revolutions of 1648 and 1789 were not mere English or French revolutions,
      but revolutions on a European scale. They were not a victory of a specific
      class of society over the old political order; they were the announcement
      of the political order of the new European society (i.e., the new
      production relations. <I>N. B</I>.). In them the bourgeoisie was
      victorious; but the victory of the bourgeoisie then meant the victory of
      the new order of society of bourgeois property over feudal property, of
      nationality over provincialism, of competition over the guild, of division
      (of the soil. <I>N</I>. <I>B</I>.) over the right of primogeniture, of
      domination by the owner of the soil over domination of the owner by the
      soil, of industry over magnificent idling, of bourgeois justice over
      medieval privileges&quot; (Marx: <I>Aus dem literarischen Nachlass</I>,
      vol. iii, Stuttgart 1920, pp.211, 212). In the period of bourgeois
      revolution, the chief obstacles to development were the following
      production relations: first, feudal ownership of land; second, the guild
      system in the rising industry; third, trade monopoly, perpetuating the
      whole by means of countless legal standards. The private ownership of
      property by the landholders led to countless imposts; most peasants were
      obliged to pay a &quot;hunger rent,&quot; and the internal market for
      industry was extremely limited. In order that industry might develop, <I>the
      feudal ownership laws had just to be broken </I>&quot;The rents&quot; says
      Thorold Rogers (in <I>The Economic Interpretation of History, </I>London,
      1891, Fisher Unwin, p.174), speaking of English rents in the Seventeenth
      Century, &quot;began as competitive rents and are rapidly transformed into
      hunger-rents, by which I mean such rents as leave the tenant a bare

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In France, before the Revolution, &quot;the people
      languished under the burden of taxes raised by the state, of duties paid
      to the landowner, of the tithes for the clergy, and compulsory service for
      all three. In every province, you could observe hosts of five thousand,
      ten thousand, of twenty thousand persons, men, women, children, wandering
      about on the roads. In 1777 an official estimate placed the number of
      beggars at 1,100,000; famine was chronic in the villages, recurring at
      frequent intervals and devastating entire provinces. Peasants deserted
      their villages in great numbers, etc.&quot; (P. Kropotkin: <I>The Great
      French Revolution, </I>London, 1921, p.16). Taxes and tributes were of
      infinite number and variety (<I>ibid</I>., p.36 <I>et seq., </I>also

      Eve of the Revolution, and the Agrarian Reform of 1789-1793</I>, Kiev
      1912, in Russian). All of these were different manifestations and
      expressions of feudal landownership. Property in land, which reduced the
      peasants to mendicants, simultaneously prevented the growth of industry,
      gave clear evidence of its retarding effect on the productive forces in
      Russia also. (Starvation rents, impoverishment of the peasantry,
      insignificant domestic markets, etc. - this combination was also the main
      cause of the Revolution of 1905. S. Maslov: <I>Die Agrarfrage in
      Russland, </I>Stuttgart 1907; also, Lenin's essays: <I>On the Agrarian
      Question in Russia, </I>in Russian.)</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The Guild organization of industry retarded the growth
      of the productive forces at every step; for instance, in English history
      there was not only a seven-year apprenticeship, but also a rule permitting
      merchants and masters in many branches of production to employ only the
      sons of freemen, having a certain amount of land, as apprentices. A system
      of petty regulations prevailed. Naturally, in view of the general
      dispersion of production, there was no possibility of a planful economy.
      On the other hand, this type of production relations was a frightful
      hindrance to all personal initiative. Technical progress had no
      possibilities of growth. The machine was considered a menace. Trade
      monopoly was also a heavy burden, likewise the immense unproductive
      national expenditures. This system as a whole therefore constituted a
      burden which had to be eliminated under the slogan of &quot;liberty&quot;
      (particularly the economic liberty to buy, sell and exploit). Of course,
      before this system of production relations finally perished, new
      production relations, expressive of the growth of the productive forces,
      had undermined this growth, but <I>they could not expand fast enough,
      they could not maintain themselves as the dominant system of such
      relations. </I>This period was the period of the dying feudal society, its
      social expression was in &quot;unsuccessful&quot; uprisings,
      insurrections, etc.; such were, for instance, the peasant wars and
      rebellions. In England, we have Wat Tyler's Rebellion, chiefly a protest
      by the English peasantry against the feudal order in the social and
      economic sense&quot; (D. Petrushevsky: <I>Wat Tyler's Rebellion</I>,
      Moscow 1914, in Russian, Introduction). Professor Petrushevsky neatly
      characterizes this period in the following generalization: the
      disintegration of English feudalism in its final form, achieved in the
      Thirteenth Century, proceeded side by side with the disintegration of the
      economic bases from which it grew. This disintegration resulted from the
      economic evolution of English society, its gradual transition from a
      closed system of economy in kind to a money economy, a political-economy
      organization&quot; (<I>ibid</I>., p.19).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Turning now to the proletarian revolution, <I>i.e.,
      </I>the transition from the capitalist form of society to socialism
      (ultimately evolving into communism), we shall again find that the
      principal cause for this transition is the conflict between the evolution
      of the productive forces and the capitalist production relations: &quot;The
      monopoly of capital (<I>i.e</I>., the privileged position of the
      capitalist class with regard to the means of production. <I>N. B.) </I>becomes
      a fetter upon the means of production which has sprung up and flourished
      along with, and under it. Centralization of the means of production and
      socialization of labor at last reach a point where they become
      incompatible with their capitalist integument. This integument bursts
      asunder. The knell of capitalist private property sounds. The
      expropriators are expropriated.&quot; (Karl Marx: <I>Capital </I>vol. i,
      p.837). Marx's remarks mean this: the growth of the productive forces is
      above all an immense increase and centralization of technical
      tools, machines, apparatus, instruments <I>of </I>production in general.
      This growth involves also a corresponding regrouping of men. <I>In part,
      </I>this occurs in the sense that the centralization of instruments of
      production leads to a centralization of the labor forces, or, as Marx puts
      it, to a socialization of labor. But this is not sufficient to bring about
      an internal equilibrium of society. The evolution of the productive forces
      requires <I>planful </I>relations, <I>i.e. consciously regulated </I>production
      relations. But herein lies the chief obstacle in the capitalist structure:
      legally speaking, in the private! property of capitalists, or in a
      collective capitalist property, held by national capitalist groups. If the
      productive forces are to develop,., the capitalist integument must be <I>broken
      through, </I>namely, the property relations of capitalism, those basic
      production relations that are legally expressed in capitalist property and
      politically perpetuated in the state organization of capital. This
      fundamental contradiction map express itself in various ways. Thus, the
      World War was an expression of this contradiction. The productive forces
      of world economy &quot;demand&quot; a world regulation; the &quot;national-capitalist
      integument&quot; is too tight; this leads to war; war leads to a
      disturbance of the social equilibrium, etc. The trustified form of
      capitalism, the artificial restriction of production in order to boost
      profits, the monopoly of inventions (legally expressed in the patent
      laws), the restriction of the domestic market (low wages, etc.), immense
      unproductive expenditures, the obstacles placed by private property in the
      way <I>of </I>technical progress (for example, the objections of the real
      estate owner to having cables laid on his land, thus preventing a general
      system of electrification), etc.- all these are various expressions and
      functions of a single quantity: the fundamental contradiction between the
      growth of the productive forces and the integument of capitalist
      production relations.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The revolutionary upheaval accompanying the transition from one form of
      class society to another is a clash between the production forces and the
      property relations in a given society is not a sudden growth, but becomes
      perceptible long before <I>the </I>revolution <I>evolves, </I>during a
      long period, terminating in a destruction of those production
      relations that act as a hindrance to the further evolution of the
      productive forces. This &quot;boiling point&quot; is reached when the new
      production relations have already matured, concealed in the entrails of
      the old production relations (Marx: <I>A Contribution to a Critique of
      Political Economy, </I>New York, 1904, p.12 ).</P>
    
    <P>Let us take a present-day example of this &quot;hatching&quot; of new
      relations in the womb of the old production relations. The capitalist
      structure includes the totality <I>of </I>production relations in
      capitalist society, the fundamental feature of which is the totality of
      relations between workers and capitalists, relations that may be
      expressed-as we have seen-by means of things (capital). The capitalist
      structure of society is therefore determined chiefly by the combination of
      the relations between the individual capitalists, and those between the
      individual workers. The capitalist structure of society is by no means
      fully expressed in the relations within the capitalist class nor is its &quot;essence&quot;
      to be found in the relations between the workers. This essence consists in
      the combination of both forms of the production relations of capitalism,
      the bond connecting and binding two basic classes, each of which
      constitutes in itself an aggregate of production relations, as stated
      above. The following is the picture of the manner in which a new mode of
      production matures within a certain old mode of production.</P>
    
    <P>Within the production relations of capitalism, i.e., within the class
      combination, a portion of these production relations constitutes the basis
      for the new &quot;socialist&quot; order of society. We have already seen
      what Marx considers as the basis of the socialist order; namely, first,
      the centralized means of production (productive forces), second
      (particularly in production relations), &quot;socialized labor&quot;,
      i.e., principally the relations within the working class, the totality of
      the production relations within the proletariat (production bond between
      all workers). It is upon this production relation of cooperation, maturing
      in the womb of capitalist production relations in general, that the temple
      of the future will rest.</P>
    
    <P>We must also obtain clarity on another point; we have seen that the
      cause of revolution is the conflict between the productive forces and the
      basic production relations (property relations). Now this fundamental
      contradiction is expressed in a contradiction production, particularly in
      a contradiction between the <I>one </I>phase of capitalist
      production relations and the <I>other </I>phase. It is c1ear that the
      social centralized labor which is embodied in the proletariat becomes more
      and more irreconcilable with the economic (and therefore with the
      political) domination of the capitalists. This &quot;socialized labor&quot;
      demands a planful economy, and will not tolerate anarchy between classes;
      it is an expression of the organized nature of society, which cannot be
      fully realized in capitalist society, particularly not in the social
      field. For, class society is a contradictory, <I>i.e., </I>unorganized
      society. Manifestly, the capitalists' will not and cannot relinquish their
      class rule. It is consequently, necessary to eliminate the rule of the
      capitalists, in order to achieve' the possibility of organization all
      along the line. We therefore encounter a conflict between the production
      relations embodied is the proletariat and those embodied in the
      bourgeoisie.</P>
    
    <P>We are now prepared to understand the following. make history, the
      conflict between the productive forces and the production relations will
      not find its expression in an attack made:, by dead machines, <I>things,
      </I>on men, which would be a monstrous and ridiculous assumption.
      Obviously, the evolution of the productive forces places <I>men </I>in a
      position of outright opposed situations, and the conflict between the
      productive forces and the production relations will find its expression in
      a conflict <I>between men, </I>between <I>classes</I>. For, the
      relations of cooperation between workers find expression in the living
      man, in the proletariat, with its interests, aspirations, its social
      energy and power. The restrictive, dominant basis of the production
      relation of capitalism also finds u its expression in living men, in the
      capitalist class. <I>The entire conflict assumes the form of a sharp
      struggle between classes; the revolutionary struggle between classes; the
      revolutionary struggle of the proletariat against the capitalist class.</I></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The opportunistic troubadours of the Social-Democracy,
      such as H. Cunow, love to emphasize the &quot;unreadiness&quot; of present
      conditions, for which they again seek support in Marx, who said that no
      form of production is succeeded by another form until it has created a
      field for the further growth of the productive forces. These hoary sages
      proceed, therefore, to finecomb the surface of the earth in their search
      for villages - let us say in Central Africa - which are still unprovided
      with savings banks, and which still contain naked savages. We should like
      to meet such efforts with a quotation from one of our own books: &quot;The
      World War, the beginning of the revolutionary era etc, <I>is precisely an
      evidence of the objective `maturity </I>here spoken of. For here we have a
      conflict of the greatest intensity, as a consequence of an antagonism that
      had developed to enormous proportions and was constantly being reproduced,
      having grown up in the womb of the capitalist system. Its destructive
      force is a fairly precise indicator of the level attained by capitalist
      evolution, a tragic expression of the complete incompatibility of the
      further growth of the productive forces with the envelope of the
      capitalist production relations. We are here dealing with the collapse so
      frequently predicted by the creator of scientific communism&quot; (N.
      Bukharin : <I>Okonomik der Transf ormationsperiode, </I>Hamburg 1922,

    <H4>c.The Revolution and its Phases</H4>
    
    <P>We have seen that the starting point of revolution is the conflict
      between the productive forces and the production relations, which places
      the class that serves as the bearer of the new mode of production in a
      peculiar position, &quot;determining&quot; its consciousness and its will
      in a specific direction. The necessary condition for revolution is
      therefore a revolutionizing of the consciousness of the new class, an
      ideological revolution in the class that is to serve as the grave-digger
      of the old society.</P>
    
    <P>It is worth while to dwell on this point, above all, to recognize that
      this revolution has a material basis. Furthermore, it is necessary to make
      clear why we are dealing with a violent alteration in the consciousness of
      a new class, namely, with a <I>revolutionary </I>process.</P>
    
    <P>Each order of society is based, as we have again and again stated, not
      only on an economic basis, for all the ideologies prevalent under a given
      order of things serve as rivets to hold together the existing order.</P>
    
    <P>These ideologies are not playthings, but in many ways serve as girders
      to maintain the equilibrium of the entire social body. It is obvious that
      if the psychology and the ideology of the oppressed classes were
      absolutely hostile to the existing order, the latter could not maintain
      itself. Any form of society will convince us that its existence is
      rendered possible on the whole by the psychology and ideology of class
      harmony, which is particularly well illustrated by the example of
      capitalism at the beginning of the World War of 1914-1918. While the
      working class had evolved an ideology that was independent of that of the
      bourgeoisie, the working class nevertheless was strongly imbued with a
      faith in the permanence of the capitalist world order, with an attachment
      to the capitalist state; the mentality of class harmony had great power.
      No true uprising of one class against the other was possible before the
      consummation of the entire psychological and ideological revolution. Such
      a mental revolution takes place when the objective evolution places the
      oppressed class in an &quot;intolerable situation&quot;: causing it to
      feel clearly that no improvement can be obtained under the existing order.
      A class attains this realization when the conflict between the growth of
      the productive forces and the production relations has produced a collapse
      of the social equilibrium, and made it impossible to restore it on the old
      basis. If we trace the course of the proletarian revolution, we shall find
      that the working class had already developed a psychology and an ideology
      that were more or less hostile to the existing order, during the
      capitalist evolution of humanity. Marxism expressed this ideology in the
      clearest and most profound manner. But precisely for the reason that
      capitalism still could and did continue to develop, even paying higher
      wages to labor by plundering and mercilessly exploiting the colonies, the
      capitalists had by no means become &quot;intolerable&quot; in the actual
      consciousness of the masses of workers. In fact, in the working classes of
      Europe and America, a sort of &quot;common interest&quot; with the
      capitalist national state was felt Simultaneously, the <I>Marxian </I>Marxism,
      originating in the Revolution of 1848, had been replaced in the labor
      parties by a specific &quot;Second International Marxism&quot;, which
      distorted the Marxian theory both with regard to the social revolution, as
      well as with regard to the doctrine of impoverishment, of collapse, of
      proletarian dictatorship, etc. This condition resulted in the betrayal by
      the Social-Democratic parties in 1914, and in the patriotic tendencies in
      the working class. Only the war, an expression of the contradiction in
      capitalist development, and its consequences, began to make clear that &quot;things
      could not go on thus&quot;. The psychology and ideology of class harmony
      were gradually replaced by the psychology and ideology of civil war, and,
      in the purely ideological field, &quot;Second International Marxism&quot;
      began to be replaced by true Marxism, i.e., by what may be properly
      designated <I>as scientific communism.</I></P>
    
    <P>Therefore: this mental revolution consists in a collapse of the old
      psychology and ideology (they are burst asunder by the new turbulent facts
      of life) and the creation of a new truly revolutionary psychology and
      ideology.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The Social-Democrats will never understand this; in
      fact, they would prefer to believe that no proletarian revolution may grow
      from the soil of misery and starvation, wherefore no revolution growing
      from this soil can be a &quot;genuine&quot; revolution. Marx's conception
      of this matter, as stated in an editorial in the New York <I>Tribune </I>of
      February 2, 1854, affords an interesting contrast to this view: &quot;Yet,
      we must not forget that a sixth power exists in Europe, maintaining at
      certain moments its domination over all five so called `great powers', and
      causing them all to tremble. This power is revolution. After having long
      dwelt in quiet retirement, it is now again summoned to the field of battle
      by crises and starvation&quot;. There is needed only a signal, and the
      sixth and greatest European power will step forth in shining armor, sword
      in hand, like Minerva from the brow of the Olympian. The impending
      European war will give the signal&quot; (quoted by Cunow, vol. i, p.322).
      Marx therefore did not engage in idiotic statements as to the
      impossibility of a proletarian revolution after the war, that revolution
      could not be built up on starvation, etc. Marx may have been mistaken as
      to the <I>tempo </I>of evolution, but he brilliantly predicted the main
      landmarks of the course of events: crises, starvation, war, etc.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The second phase of revolution is<I> political revolution, i.e., </I>the
      seizing of power by the new class. The revolutionary psychology of the new
      class becomes action. The oppressed class, encountering the concentrated
      power of the dominant class, namely, its state apparatus, disorganizes, in
      the process of struggle, the opponent's state organization, in order to
      break down the resistance it offers. This state organization is to a
      certain extent destroyed and then rebuilt, partly from elements of the old
      system, partly from new elements. We must here point out that the seizure
      of power by the new class is not and cannot be merely a transfer of the
      same state organization from one hand to another. Even socialist circles
      have been subject to this naive error. Marx and Engels specifically speak
      of the destruction of an old power and the creation of a new power, and
      naturally so, for the state organization is the highest expression of the
      power of the ruling class, its congelation, its concentrated authority,
      its principal fighting mechanism, its principal weapon of self-defense
      against the oppressed class. How could the oppressed class break the
      resistance of its oppressors without laying hands on the principal weapon
      of oppression? How can an economy be <I>defeated without disorganizing
      its powers? </I>Either the powers of the commanding class are on the whole
      uninjured, in which case the revolution may be regarded as lost; or they
      revolution is victorious, which usually amounts to the disorganization,
      the destruction of the forces (chiefly, the state organization) of the
      commanding class. But as the material power of the state authority finds
      its most important expression in the armed forces, <I>i.e., </I>in the
      <I>army, </I>it is evident that whatever destruction has taken place has
      chiefly affected the whole army. The English Revolution in the Seventeenth
      Century showed this by destroying the state power of the feudal kings,
      their army, etc., and creating the revolutionary army of the Puritans, as
      well as Cromwell's dictatorship. The French Revolution also showed it, by
      disintegrating the royal army and creating another army on a new basis.
      The Russian Revolution beginning in 1917 has illustrated the same point in
      its destruction of the state mechanism of the feudal landowners and the
      bourgeoisie, its disorganization and destruction <I>of </I>the
      imperialist army, and its creation of a new state of an entirely new type,
      and a new revolutionary army.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Both Marx and Engels were well aware of this
      theoretically; we shall not take pains to prove this statement, as the
      reader will find the necessary material in Lenin's <I>State and
      Revolution, </I>the orthodox Marxian treatment of which is now recognized
      even by bourgeois scholars (such as Struve and particularly P. I.
      Novgorodtsev: On <I>the Social Ideal </I>Berlin 1921, in Russian). When
      forced into a corner, the Social-Democratic theoreticians now find
      themselves obliged to attack Marx openly, and to oppose the revolutionary,
      &quot;destructive&quot; phase of his doctrine. This grateful function has
      devolved upon Heinrich Cunow, (<I>ibid, vol. i</I>, p.310: &quot;Marx
      kontra Marx&quot;), who repeats Sombart's stupid fiction to the effect
      that the scholar Marx had inflicted great damage upon Marx the
      revolutionary. Cunow distinguishes two &quot;divergent forms&quot; of the
      theory of the founder of scientific communism; first, according to Cunow,
      the state is regarded by Marx, <I>sociologically, </I>as a thing arising
      from the conditions of economic evolution, an organization fulfilling
      social functions; second, Marx also conceives the state from a <I>purely
      political </I>point of view, as a class instrument of oppression,
      responsible for all evil. The first point of view is that of a scholar;
      the second, that of an &quot;optimistic revolutionary&quot; (!). It is in
      the latter view, according to Cunow, that we must seek an explanation for
      Marx's hatred of the state and his effort to overthrow the state machinery
      of the bourgeoisie.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is easy to point out the error in Cunow's view. He
      is wrong in contrasting the &quot;social functions&quot; of the state
      machine with its class-oppressing character. &quot;Politics is the
      concentrated expression of economy.&quot; Capitalist production is
      inconceivable without the capitalist state. The capitalist production, of
      course, fulfills very important functions. But the fact of the matter is
      that during a revolution, the &quot;important social functions&quot;
      discard one historical garment and put on another, which takes place by a
      shift in classes, by a <I>break-up </I>of the old relations. Cunow's
      sophistries are a repetition of Renner's sophistries. During the war,
      Renner supported the Fatherland of the Hapsburgs and of capitalist profit
      by the following reasoning: uninstructed persons imagine capital to be a
      thing; Marx has shown that it is a social relation; this relation
      necessarily possesses two phases: capitalists and workers; consequently -
      this is Renner's inference - when you speak of the capitalist; you
      necessarily imply the existence of the capitalist; consequently in
      defending the worker, you must also defend the capitalist, for neither can
      exist without the other; such are the &quot;interests&quot; of the whole.
      All such considerations of course assume in advance that the wage worker
      wishes to remain a wage worker forever. In actual fact, however,
      revolution is not concerned with the &quot;right&quot; to be a wage
      worker, but with the &quot;right&quot; to<I> cease </I>to be a wage
      worker.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The political phase of revolution therefore does not involve a mere <I>seizure
      </I>of the <I>intact old machinery </I>by a new class, but more or less
      (depending on which class follows upon the old society) a <I>destruction
      of this machinery, </I>followed by the erection of a new organization,
      <I>i.e., </I>a new combination of things and persons, a new coordination
      of the corresponding ideas.</P>
    
    <P>The third stage of revolution is the <I>economic revolution. </I>The
      new class, now in power, makes use of its power as a lever for economic
      upheaval, breaks up the production relations of the old type and begins to
      erect new relations which have been maturing in the womb of the old order,
      and <I>in contradiction </I>with that order. Marx defines this period of
      revolution as follows, in his discussion of the proletarian revolution: &quot;The
      proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all
      capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all instruments of production
      in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organized as the
      ruling class; and to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as
      possible. Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by
      means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions
      of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear
      economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the
      movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old
      social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing
      the mode of production.&quot; <SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#4" NAME="4b">4)</A></SUP>
    </P>
    
    <P>We are now obliged to consider an important and fundamental question: in
      the typical case, how does this transformation, this reorganization of
      production relations, actually proceed, and how should it proceed?</P>
    
    <P>The old Social-Democratic view on this point was quite simple. The new
      class - in the proletarian revolution, the proletariat - removes the
      commanding &quot;heads&quot;, whom it dismisses more or less gently, and
      then assumes control of the social apparatus of production, which has been
      developed to a splendid and uninjured maturity in the bowels of the
      capitalist Abraham. The proletariat installs its own &quot;heads&quot;,
      and the thing is done. Production goes; on without interruption, the
      process of production suffers no set back, the entire society sails on
      harmoniously on its course toward a full-blown socialist order. But a
      closer inspection of the revolution in the production relations will show
      us that these production relations, as viewed from the point of view of
      the labor process, are nothing more nor less than the total human labor
      mechanism, a system of interconnected persons, who, as we know, are
      related by a specific type of bond. Furthermore - an extremely important
      point - the labor functions of the various groups of persons in class
      society are connected with each other, <I>bound up with their class
      function. </I>Therefore a shifting of the class relations more or less
      destroys the old labor apparatus, causing the construction of a new one,
      precisely as in the political phase of the revolution. It is certain that
      a <I>temporary </I>decrease in the productive forces will result; every
      change in society must be paid for by discomfort. It is also evident that
      the degree to which the old apparatus is destroyed, the depth of the
      wound, depends above all on the extent of the shift in the class
      relations. In bourgeois revolutions the power of command in production
      passes from one group of owners to another; the principle of property
      remains valid; the proletariat retains its former place. Consequently, the
      destruction and disintegration of old institutions is far smaller than in
      cases in which the lowest layer of the pyramid, the proletariat, takes its
      place at the top. In such a case, an immense upheaval is inevitable. The
      old order: bourgeoisie, upper class intellectuals, middle class
      intellectuals, proletariat, is <I>destroyed. </I>The proletariat stands
      in splendid isolation; everyone's hand is raised against it. There results
      an inevitable temporary disorganization of production, which continues
      until the proletariat succeeds in rearranging the order of persons,
      uniting them with a <I>new </I>bond, i.e., until a new structural
      equilibrium of society has become effective.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This principle was enunciated by the present writer in
      his <I>Ökonomik der Transformationsperiode </I>(particularly chapter
      iii) to which those interested are referred. A few supplementary remarks
      may not be out of place. First, may this view be considered orthodox? We
      believe Marx interpreted the matter thus; at least, it is suggestive that
      Marx here uses precisely the same expression as that used in his
      discussion of the destruction of the state. He says that the envelope
      (integument) of capitalist production relations is &quot;burst asunder&quot;
      (<I>Capital, </I>Vol. 1, p.837); In other passages he speaks of a
      dissolving a &quot;rebuilding&quot;. Obviously, a ` bursting asunder&quot;
      of production relations must interrupt the &quot;regularity of the
      production process&quot;, though a different condition might be more
      pleasant. Very probably this is the thought that peers through-though in
      rudimentary form-where Mark speaks of the economic &quot;untenability&quot;,
      of a &quot;despotic inroad&quot; by the proletariat, which nevertheless,
      so to say, is profitable in the long run. Second, we have heard a number
      of objections with regard to the New Economic Policy in Russia. The
      objectors point out that in the <I>Ökonomik der
      Transfornaationsperiode </I>we are too one-sided in our defense of the
      Russian Communist Party in its blind attack on everything; for the facts
      of life now show that the mechanism should not have been destroyed; now,
      it would appear, we have become as mild and gentle as the Scheidemanns. In
      other words, the destruction of the capitalist production apparatus is
      represented as a <I>fact </I>in the Russian reality, but not as a general
      law of revolutionary transition from one form of society (capitalist) to
      the other (socialist). This &quot;objection&quot; is apparently based on a
      very careless conception of the matter. The Russian workers could not
      readmit the capitalists, etc., before they had given them a resounding
      thrashing and gained a firm foothold themselves, <I>i.e., </I>until the
      conditions of the new social equilibrium had been established in their
      main outlines, but our critics would prefer to start from the other end.
      Even in our official mechanism (for instance, in the army) we are now
      admitting great numbers of the old officers in Russia, and giving them
      commanding posts. Could we have afforded to do this at the beginning of
      the revolution? Dared we <I>refrain from </I>destroying the old Czarist
      army? The army would then not have been ruled by workers, but would have
      ruled the workers, which has of course been sufficiently proved by the
      experiences with Ministers Scheidemann and Noske in Germany, Otto Bauer
      and Renner in Austria, and Vandervelde in Belgium. Third, nine-tenths of
      the New Economic Policy of Russia is due to the peasant character of the
      country, <I>i.e., </I>to specific Russian conditions. Fourth, we are of
      course speaking of the typical course of events. Under special conditions,
      we may have a state of affairs that will not involve destruction. For
      example, after the proletariat has been victorious in the most important
      nations, the bourgeoisie may perhaps surrender with all its mechanism.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The above point o£ view by no means maintains that
      all of society disintegrates into individual persons. On the contrary, it
      maintains that the various hierarchical strata of persons are segregated
      from each other; the proletariat cuts loose from the other strata
      (technical mental workers, bourgeoisie, etc.), but within itself, as an
      aggregate of persons, it closes its ranks more tightly, at least for the
      most part. This forms the basis for the <I>new </I>production relations
      (we have already seen that &quot;socialized labor&quot;, chiefly
      represented by the proletariat, is the very element that has &quot;become
      mature&quot; within the framework of the old economic order).</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The fourth (last) phase of revolution is the <I>technical revolution.
      </I>A new social equilibrium having been attained, i.e., a new and durable
      envelope of production relations having been created, capable of serving
      as an evolutionary form of the productive forces, an accelerated evolution
      of these forces now sets on; the barriers are down, the wounds inflicted
      by the social crisis are healed, an unparalleled boom begins. New tools
      are introduced, a new technical foundation is created, a revolution in
      technique takes place.. Now a &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;organic&quot;
      period in the evolution of the new social form sets in, creating its
      corresponding psychology and ideology.</P>
    
    <P>We shall now recapitulate. The starting point for revolutionary
      development was a disturbance of the equilibrium between the productive
      forces and the production relations, as evidenced in a disturbance of the
      equilibrium between the various portions of the production relations. This
      disturbance of the equilibrium between classes is expressed chiefly in the
      destruction of the psychology of class harmony. Furthermore, there is a
      sudden disturbance of political equilibrium, which is restored on a new
      basis, then a sudden disturbance of the economic structural equilibrium,
      also restored on a new basis, followed by the erection of a new technical
      foundation. Society begins its life on a new basis; all the functions of
      its life assume a new historical raiment.</P>

    <H4>d.Cause and Effect in the Transition Period; Cause and Effect in
    Periods of Decline</H4>
    
    <P>Our discussion of the process of revolution, which is equivalent to a
      process of transition from one social form to another, led us to the
      conclusion that this process, after its initial clash between the
      productive forces and the production relations, passes through a number of
      phases, <I>beginning </I>with ideology, <I>ending </I>in technique, a
      sort of reverse order, as it were. In this connection, it will be useful
      to examine a concrete example afforded by the proletarian revolution.
      Heinrich Cunow, self-appointed critic of Marx, finds a contradiction
      between two passages in Marx (one taken from the <I>Poverty of
      Philosophy, </I>the other from the <I>Communist Manifesto</I>). In
      the first passage we read: &quot;The working class, in the course of
      evolution, will put in the place of bourgeois society an association which
      will exclude classes and their opposite, and there will no longer be any
      political authority as such, because the political authority is the
      expression of class hostility within bourgeois society.&quot; The other
      passage (C<I>omvnunist Manifesto</I>) defines the course of events as
      follows: &quot;If the proletariat in its struggle with the bourgeoisie is
      forced to unite itself as a class, to make itself to eliminate the old
      production relations by force, in destroying these production relations it
      also destroys the basic conditions for the existence of class
      contradictions; it thus abolishes classes altogether, as well as its own
      class rule.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#5" NAME="5b">5)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P>Cunow makes the following reply: &quot;This (the passage in the <I>Communist
      Manifesto. N. B</I>.) is, sociologically speaking, almost the direct
      opposite of the above sentence from Marx's <I>Poverty of Philosophy. </I>In
      the latter work, we have, first, the abolition of class stratification, in
      the course of social evolution, which is followed by its political (!)
      conquest, since the basis of the old state authority is thus destroyed.
      But in the <I>Communist Manifesto, </I>we have, first, the conquest of
      the state power, followed by the application of this power to an overthrow
      of the capitalist production relations, upon the disappearance of which
      the class contradictions and finally classes as such are abolished in the
      sequel.&quot; <SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#6" NAME="6b">6)</A></SUP>
      Cunow therefore maintains that in the <I>Poverty of Philosophy, </I>Marx
      shows himself to be a learned evolutionist, while the <I>Communist
      Manifesto </I>reveals him as a crazy revolutionist. Mr. Cunow is here
      consciously distorting the facts, for he knows that the <I>Poverty of
      Philosophy </I>calls for a &quot;bloody battle&quot; (&quot;bloody battle
      or non-existence; thus - only thus - does history put the question&quot;).
      In the first passage, Marx is speaking of the period <I>after </I>the
      conquest of power, of the dying out of the power of the proletariat; he is
      not discussing any &quot;political conquest&quot;, but he considers the
      political authority from the outset as a vanishing quantity. The same is
      the case in the <I>Communist Manifesto. </I>There is no doubt, therefore,
      that Marx considered the conquest of political power (<I>i.e., </I>the
      destruction of the old state machinery and the <I>characteristic </I>new
      machinery) as a condition for the transformation of the production
      relations, brought about by a forceful &quot;expropriation of the
      expropriators&quot;. We are therefore dealing with things in the reverse
      order. The analysis is not proceeding from economy to politics, but from
      politics to economy. In fact, since production relations are being altered
      by the lever of political authority, it follows that economy is determined
      by policy. Cunow is absolutely wrong when he says that we are here dealing
      with a sociology that precisely contradicts Marx's sociology. The proper
      word for this procedure is <I>forgery</I>.</P>
    
    <P>It is important not to lose sight of the point of departure of the
      entire process, which is the conflict between the evolution of the
      productive forces and the property relations. The entire social's
      transformation is based on this beginning, and does not cease its harsh
      course until a new structural equilibrium has ensued in society. In other
      words: a revolution begins when the property relations have become a
      hindrance to the evolution of the productive forces; revolution has done
      its work, as soon as <I>new </I>production relations have been
      established, to serve as forms favoring the evolution of the productive
      forces. Between this beginning and this ending lies the reverse order in
      <I>the influence of the super structures</I>.</P>
    
    <P>In the previous chapters we have seen that the superstructure is not
      merely a &quot;passive&quot; portion of the social process: it is a
      specific force, against which it would be absurd to argue, as even Mr.
      Cunow will admit. But just at this point we have an extended analysis, in
      time, of a reversed process of influence, which analysis results from the
      catastrophic character of the entire process, from the disturbance of all
      the customary functions. In so called &quot;normal times&quot;, any
      contradictions arising between the productive forces and economy, etc.,
      are quickly obliterated, are quickly absorbed by the superstructure, which
      passes it on to the economy and the productive forces, the cycle then
      beginning all over again, etc., etc. In this case, however, the mutual
      adaptation of the various sections of the social mechanism proceed with
      dreadful slowness, with torments, with immense sacrifice; and the
      contradictions themselves are here contradictions of immense proportions.
      It is not surprising, therefore, that the process of a reversed influence
      of the superstructure (political ideology, conquest of power, application
      of this power in reshaping the production relations) is of long duration,
      filling an entire historical period. But precisely this is the <I>peculiarity
      of the transition period, </I>which Mr. Cunow absolutely fails to
      understand.</P>
    
    <P>The following also must be understood. Every superstructural force,
      including also the concentrated authority of a class, its state authority,
      is a <I>power; </I>but this power is <I>not unlimited. No </I>force can
      transcend its own limits. The limits imposed upon the political power of a
      new class that has seized the power are inherent in the existing state of
      economic conditions and therefore of the productive forces. In other
      words: <I>the alteration in the economic conditions that may be attained
      with the aid of the political lever itself dependent on the previous state
      of the economic conditions</I>. This may be best seen from the Russian
      proletarian revolution. In November, 1917, the working class seized power,
      but it could not think of centralizing and socializing the petty bourgeois
      economy, particularly the peasant economy. In 1921 it transpired that the
      Russian economy was even stronger than had been supposed, and that the
      forces of the proletarian state machinery were merely sufficient to
      maintain a socialization of large-scale industry, and not even all of 
      that. Let us now approach another phase of the question. Let us attempt to
      understand the nature of the interruption of the productive forces,
      introduced by the revolutionary process; also, the temporary <I>reduction
      </I>in the level of these productive forces.</P>
    
    <P>Unorganized society, of which capitalist commodities society is the most
      striking expression, always develops by leaps and bounds. We are aware
      that capitalism involves wars and industrial crises. We all know that
      these wars and crises are an &quot;essential phase&quot; of the capitalist
      order of society. In other words, the continued existence of capitalism
      necessarily involves crises and capitalist wars; this is a &quot;natural
      law&quot; of capitalist evolution. What is the meaning of this law, from
      the point of view of the productive forces of society? First, what is it
      that happens during a crisis? We have a cessation of factory work, an
      increase of unemployment, a lower production; many enterprises, small ones
      particularly, disappear; in other words, there is a partial <I>destruction
      of the productive forces</I>. Parallel with this process, there is an
      enhancement of the <I>organized forms </I>of capitalism; a strengthening
      of the large-scale enterprises, the formation of trusts and other powerful
      monopoly organizations. After the crises, there is a new cycle of
      development, a new growth on a <I>new </I>basis, under <I>higher </I>organizational
      forms, affording greater opportunities for the evolution of the productive
      forces. The possibility of continued evolution is therefore bought at the
      price of a crisis and a waste of productive farces during the crisis. To a
      certain extent, the case in capitalist wars is the same. These wars are an
      expression of capitalist competition; they result in a temporary decrease
      in the productive forces. After wars, bourgeois states rounded out their
      boundaries; great powers became greater; small states were swallowed up;
      capital assumed world-wide proportions, obtained a greater field of
      exploitation, the outlines within which the productive forces could
      develop were extended, a temporary decline was followed by a swifter
      process of accumulation. It may therefore be said that the possibility of
      an <I>expanded reproduction </I>was purchased, in this case also, at the
      price of a temporary decline in the productive forces.</P>
    
    <P>The same law may be observed from the wider point of view; from which we
      regard the evolution of society. The significance, of revolution is in its
      elimination of an <I>obstacle </I>to the development of the productive
      forces. Strange as it may seem, in destroying this hindrance, revolution
      temporarily destroys a portion of its productive forces. This is as
      inevitable as the crises under capitalism.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The destructive effects of revolution (&quot;debit side
      of revolution&quot;) may be considered under the following heads:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">1. <I>Physical destruction of the elements of
      production. </I>Destruction of things and persons, in any form, during the
      civil war process, may be included here. If barricades are constructed of
      railroad cars, and men are killed (civil war and class war involve such
      sacrifices), this is equivalent to a destruction of productive forces. The
      annihilation of machines, factories, railroads, cattle, etc.; the injury
      and ruin of instruments of production by sabotage, failure to repair or
      replace -absent parts, etc., absence of workers due to war, departure of
      mental workers, etc.; these are phases of the physical destruction of the
      productive forces. </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">2.<I> Deterioration of the elements of production.
      </I>Here belongs: deterioration of machinery for lack o£ repair and
      replacement; physical exhaustion of workers, intellectuals, etc, resorting
      to inferior substitutes (poorer metal, replacement of male labor by female
      and child labor; petty bourgeois elements in the factories, etc.). </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">3. Interruption of liaison between the elements of
      production. This is the main cause of the specifically revolutionary
      disintegration; it includes the disorganization of the production
      relations spoken of in our large-type text. (Destruction of liaison
      between the proletariat, on the one hand, and the technical mental workers
      and bourgeoisie on the other hand; disintegration of capitalist
      organizations; decay of liaison between city and country, etc., etc.).
      This does not mean a physical destruction of productive forces (things and
      persons), but their <I>elimination from the process of production; </I>factories
      not working, men idle. Also, there is the waste due to the initial &quot;inability&quot;
      of the new class, its incapacity to build up its organizations, its &quot;mistakes&quot;,
      etc.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">4. Shifting the production forces for unproductive
      consumption, including the readjustment of a great portion of the
      productive forces for military purposes; manufacture of cannons, rifles
      military supplies, other war materials. <I>cf. Oekonomik der
      Transformationsperiode, </I>chap, vi). </FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This enumeration is based on the proletarian
      revolution; obviously, any revolution will present the same
      classification, but the total &quot;expense&quot; of revolution will in
      general be lower in bourgeois revolutions.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">History fully supports these theoretical principles.
      The peasant wars in Germany were followed by immense disorganization;
      French Revolution, with its financial crises, its monstrous price
      inflation, famine, etc., shows the same course. The Civil War in the
      United States put the country back at least ten years. Later, the social
      transformation having been accomplished, a boom period will ensue,
      advances proceeding much more rapidly than any advances in the
      pre-revolutionary period, since society has now found a more appropriate
      envelope for its productive forces.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Therefore: the transition from one form of society to another is
      accompanied by a temporary lowering of the productive forces, which cannot
      in any other way find an opportunity for further evolution.</P>
    
    <P>The law of decline is distinguished from the law of the transition
      period by the fact that the transition in the former case does not lead to
      a higher economic form; in this case, the decline in the productive forces
      will continue until society receives some impulse from without, or until
      its equilibrium has been found on a lower basis, whereupon we have a &quot;repetition&quot;,
      or a permanent state of stagnation, not a higher form of economic
      relations.</P>
    
    <P>An analysis of the causes of a decline will in general show that they
      are due to the impossibility of breaking down the given property
      relations; they therefore remain fetters on evolution, and react on the
      productive forces, so that the latter continue &quot;going down&quot; all
      the time. This may be the case, for example, when the</P>
    
    <P>opposing classes in a revolution are of about the same strength, making
      a victory impossible for either class; the society is doomed.</P>
    
    <P>The conflict between the productive forces and the production relations
      has determined the will of the classes in a specific manner. But
      revolution has not advanced beyond its earliest phases. The classes give
      battle; neither is victorious; production falls asleep; society dies out.
      Or, we may have the case in which the victorious class is incapable of
      disposing of the tasks imposed upon it, or, the revolution may not mature
      to the &quot;boiling point&quot;; but the evolution of the productive
      forces has been proceeding in an environment in which it has determined a
      quite specific class alignment, namely, a completely parasitic ruling
      class, and a completely demoralized oppressed class. Here there will be no
      evolution; sooner or later a simple, one might say a &quot;bloodless&quot;,
      disintegration and dissolution will take place. Or, we may have a case of
      mixed type. All these cases show that the evolution of the productive
      forces has led to an economy and to such forms of &quot;superstructure&quot;
      as have a reverse influence of such nature on the evolution of the
      productive forces as to oblige them to go down. Of course, when the
      productive forces go down, the level of the entire social life will also
      go down.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Greece and Rome may be taken as examples of social
      decay, later Spain and Portugal. The ruling classes, maintained by the
      slaves conquered in countless wars, became parasites, also a portion of
      the free burghers. Their technology permitted them to wage wars, thus
      conditioning a corresponding economy, which produced a specific state
      order; but the material condition of the classes also determined their:
      being, their social psychology (a mentality of parasitic degeneration;,
      among the rulers; of degeneration by stupefaction and oppression among the
      oppressed). Such a superstructure was too heavy for its basis, the
      productive forces, which ceased to grow, ultimately becoming a negative
      quantity. In place of this perfectly simple explanation, most scholars
      present an unspeakable confusion, of which an excellent, specimen is
      afforded by the latest book of P. Bitsilli: <I>The Fall of the Roman
      Empire. </I>Vassilyev, a professor at the University of Kazan,.who
      enumerates - in a work already quoted by us - all the theories explaining
      the fall of the ancient world, particularly emphasizes the theory
      of biological degeneration. This degeneration, in the case of ,x: the
      rulers, according to Professor Vassilyev, is a necessary consequence and
      the natural end of any civilization (with certain reservations): for,
      brawn is replaced by brain, the nervous system develops its wants, a
      biological deterioration results. Mr. Vassilyev therefore believes that
      the materialist Marxian conception of history should be replaced by the
      materialist <I>Vassilyev </I>conception, which is much &quot;profounder&quot;.
      Mr. Vassilyev points out that the progress of the social sciences has
      taken the following path: first, there was an analysis of ideology; then,
      of policy; then, of the social order; then, of economy (Marx). We are told
      that we must now penetrate still more profoundly, descending to the
      material nature of man, his physiological constitution, the changes in
      which constitute the &quot;essence&quot; of the historical process. There
      is no doubt that the material nature of man changes; but, if we proceed
      beyond the limits of social laws, we must advance from biology to physics
      and chemistry, and then we shall become fully aware of Mr. Vassilyev's
      error. The fact of the matter is that the law of cause and effect in
      social <I>science </I>must be a <I>social</I> law. If we wish to explain
      the social properties of man's material nature, we must determine what are
      the social causes whose influence has altered the physiology (and also the
      psychology) of man. We shall then find that this phase is determined above
      all by the conditions of material being, <I>i.e., </I>by the situation of
      the given groups in production. Mr. Vassilyev is therefore not digging
      deeper, but walking backwards; his theory is actually the time-honored
      theory of the inevitable aging of the human race. Besides being useless
      because it is based on a mere analogy with physical organisms, it is not
      capable of explaining the simplest phenomena. Why, for instance, has the
      infinitely more complicated European civilization not passed away, whereas
      Rome degenerated? Why did Spain &quot;fall&quot; and not England?
      Commonplaces about degeneration will explain nothing, for the simple
      reason that this degeneration is a product of social conditions. Only an
      analysis of these conditions can result in a proper view of the subject.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">An analysis of the causality of the transition period
      and the periods of decay will also throw light on the question of what
      determines the evolution of the productive forces, and what is the
      influence under which they are changing. Obviously, they are changing <I>under
      the reversed influence of the basis, and of all the superstructural forms.
      </I>Marx himself recognizes this. Thus, he informs us in <I>Capital </I>(Chicago,
      1909, Vol. iii, p.98): &quot;Such a development of the productive power is
      traceable in the last instance to the social nature of the labor engaged
      in production; to the division of labor in society; to the development of
      intellectual labor, especially of the natural sciences.&quot; Strictly
      speaking, the matter does not end here : Marx emphasizes only the most
      important factors influencing the productive forces in industry. &quot;But,&quot;
      our opponents may object, &quot;why do you begin at just this point?&quot;
      Our answer is: &quot;For the simple reason that, no matter what
      interactions may be taking place within society, the internal social
      relations at any given moment will-insofar as we are considering society
      in its condition of equilibrium-correspond with the relation existing
      between society and nature.&quot;</FONT></P>

    <H4>e.The Evolution of the Productive Forces and the Materialization of
    Social Phenomena (Accumulation of Civilization)</H4>
    
    <P>A consideration of the process of production and reproduction, where the
      productive forces are <I>growing, will </I>present us with a general law;
      namely, as the productive forces grow, more and more labor is applied in
      the production of instruments of production. With the aid of these
      constantly increasing instruments of production, which are a part of the
      social <I>technique, </I>a much smaller part of the work than formerly
      will produce a much greater quantity of useful products of all kinds. When
      manual labor was used, comparatively little time was devoted to the
      manufacture of instruments of production. Men worked in the sweat of their
      brows with their insignificant, wretched tools, and their work was not
      very productive. But in a highly evolved society a great portion of their
      labor is devoted to the production of immense labor tools - machines,
      mechanisms - in order to produce further immense instruments of
      production, such as huge factories, electrical power stations, mines,
      etc., which consume a large part of the human forces available. But the
      use of these tremendous instruments of production vastly increases the
      productivity of living labor; the investment yields more than compound
      interest.</P>
    
    <P>In capitalist society, this law is expressed in the relative increase of
      constant capital as compared with variable capital. That portion of
      capital that has been devoted to the construction of factory plants,
      machines, etc., grows more rapidly than the portion put into wages. In
      other words, in the evolution of the productive forces in capitalist
      society, the <I>constant </I>capital grows more rapidly than the <I>variable
      </I>capital. We may state this in another manner, as the productive forces
      of society grow, they are being constantly realigned, with the result that
      an increasingly greater share of these forces goes into the branches
      producing instruments of production.</P>
    
    <P>The growth of the productive forces, the accumulation of man's power
      over nature, is expressed in the higher and higher &quot;specific&quot;
      weight assigned to <I>things, </I>to dead labor, to the social technique.</P>
    
    <P>It is reasonable to inquire whether similar phenomena are presented by
      other fields of social life, for we have seen that the superstructural
      labor is also labor, differentiated labor, which has been segregated from
      material labor. And we have seen that the outline of the superstructure
      includes both material elements and personal elements, as well as
      ideological elements proper. Where is there here an accumulation, an
      aggregation of &quot;mental&quot; culture? Do we here encounter anything
      resembling the material process of production?</P>
    
    <P>Let us anticipate: Yes, there is such a similarity, expressed in the
      fact that the social ideology is crystallized or congealed in things which
      are quite material. Let us remember that we are enabled to reproduce the
      ancient &quot;mental cultures&quot; out of the so called &quot;monuments&quot;
      of earlier epochs; the remnants of old libraries, the books, inscriptions,
      clay tablets, statues, paintings, temples, old musical instruments, and
      thousands of other things. In a way, we may regard these things as a
      congealed, materialized ideology of ages long gone by, enabling us to
      judge the psychology and ideology; of their contemporaries with precision,
      as the remnants of working tools enable us to judge of the stage reached
      in the evolution of the productive forces, and even of the economy of
      these epochs. Furthermore, in the superstructural work, in ideological
      labor, instruments of <I>consumption </I>frequently serve also as
      instruments for further production. A picture gallery contains instruments
      of enjoyment; for the public which goes to view them, it consists of
      consumption products. But they are also instruments of production, not in
      the same sense - of course - as brushes and canvas, for the coming
      generations learn art, a new &quot;tendency&quot; in painting, from them.
      A new school of does not descend from heaven, but grows out of an earlier
      stage, even though it may renounce and denounce the old ideological
      system. Nothing is made of nothing. As, in the political field, the old
      state is destroyed during a revolution, while the new state will contain
      many old elements in a<I> new </I>arrangement, so, in the ideological
      field, even the greatest interruptions do not wipe out a certain
      succession and connection with the past: the new building is not
      constructed on the &quot;bare ground&quot;. Paintings, for the painter,
      are an instrument of production, an accumulated artistic experience, a
      congealed ideology, from which any further movement in this field must
      take its start.</P>
    
    <P>Perhaps the following objection might be made: &quot;All this may be
      very fine, but what has the sublime doctrine of Christianity in common
      with the material symbols that have been traced on parchment or paper, or
      with the pigskin in which the Gospels are bound? What is the connection
      between the scientific ideology as such and the masses of paper that have
      been piled up in the libraries? Surely there is a difference between the
      ideologies, the most delicate product of the collective human mind, and
      such gross material things as books, considered as <I>things!&quot; </I>But
      this argument may be due to a misunderstanding. To be sure, paper <I>per
      se, </I>or coloring matter, or pigskin, would in these cases have no
      meaning for us if they were without a social <I>being. </I>We have shown
      in chapter <I>vi </I>(<I>b. Things, Men, Ideas</I>) that a machine -
      considered outside of its social connection - is merely a piece of metal,
      wood, etc. But it has also a social being, in that men interpret it as a
      machine in the labor process. Similarly, the book, in addition to its
      physical being, as a piece of paper, also has a social being; it is
      considered as a book in the process of reading. Here, the book is a
      congealed ideology, an instrument of ideological production.</P>
    
    <P>If we approach the question of the accumulation of mental culture from
      this angle, it will be easy to admit that this accumulation takes the form
      of an accumulation of things, of crystallized, material shapes. The &quot;richer&quot;
      a field of mental culture is, the more imposing, the broader the field of
      these &quot;materialized social phenomena&quot;. Figuratively speaking
      (and not forgetting its character as an ideology), the material skeleton
      of mental culture is the &quot;fundamental capital&quot; of this culture,
      which increases with the &quot;richness&quot; of this culture, and is
      dependent &quot;in the last analysis&quot; on the stage reached in the
      material productive forces. The childish inscriptions, masks, rude images
      of idols, drawings on stones, art monuments, rolls of papyrus, other
      manuscripts, parchment books, temples and observatories, clay tablets,
      with their cuneiform writings; later, the galleries, museums, botanical
      and zoological gardens, huge libraries, independent scientific
      exhibitions, laboratories, sketches, printed books, etc., etc., are an
      accumulated crystallized experience of humanity. The new library stacks,
      with their new books, considered together with the olds stacks and books,
      are an interesting physical manifestation of collaboration of many
      generations in their uninterrupted succession.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">We have become so accustomed to many phenomena in this
      field as to lose sight of the historical boundaries. Our present-day
      psychology and ideology, for instance, finds its crystallization in the
      daily newspaper. Yet, the newspaper itself is a modern phenomenon,
      beginning approximately in the Seventeenth Century. No doubt important
      official news was already posted on walls (&quot;published&quot;) in
      ancient Rome and among the Chinese (Eighth Century A.D.), but this was
      barely a beginning (<I>cf. K. </I>Bücher: <I>Das Zeitatngswesen
      </I>in <I>Kultur der Gegenwart</I>, Berlin and Leipzig, 1906, part i,
      section i.). Books, in our sense, are also not found before the invention
      of printing, when there were only rolls of papyrus and parchment codices,
      then the most perfect method of preserving the accumulated &quot;wisdom of
      centuries&quot;, clay tablets:(Babylon) preserved in gigantic libraries.
      For example, Ashurbanipal's famous library (<I>cf</I>. Pietschmann: <I>Das
      Buch, </I>in <I>Kultur der Gegenwart). </I>Libraries (called by Leibnitz &quot;treasuries
      of all the riches of the human spirit&quot;) may therefore be found in
      very ancient times, and it is to the remnants of such libraries that we
      owe most of our information on many secrets of times long past (a short
      study on libraries is found in <I>Die Bibliotheken, </I>by Fritz Milkau,
      in <I>Kultur der Gegenwart). </I>Important examples are: the above
      mentioned library of Ashurbanipal (Seventh Century B.C.), also the
      libraries of the most ancient ecclesiastical schools (Third Century B.C.).
      Hermann Diels (<I>Die Organisation der Wissenschaft, </I>in <I>Kultur
      der Gegenwart</I>, p.639) rightly observes: &quot;Among all institutions
      of learning, libraries have ever been the most important and most
      essential means of preserving, disseminating and transmitting learning and
      of supplementing the evanescent <I>viva vox </I>of living teachers.&quot;
      Art objects, of course, play the same rôle, as preserved in
      collections, galleries, museums, cathedrals, etc.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The accumulation of mental culture is therefore not only an accumulation
      of psychological and ideological elements in the minds of men, but also an
      accumulation of things.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="f"></A></P>
    
    <H4>f. The Process of Reproduction of Social Life as a Whole</H4>
    
    <P>We are now in a position to recapitulate this subject:</P>
    
    <P>A constant &quot;metabolism&quot; is taking place between nature and
      society, a process of social reproduction, a labor process operating in
      cycles, constantly replacing what is consumed, extending its basis as the
      productive forces develop, and enabling mankind to widen the boundaries of
      its existence.</P>
    
    <P>But the process of production of material products is simultaneously a
      process of production of given economic relations. Marx says: Capitalist
      production, therefore under its aspect of a continuous connected process,
      of a process of reproduction, produces not only commodities, not only
      surplus-value, but it also produces and reproduces the capitalist
      relation; on the one hand the capitalist, on the other, the wage-laborer.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#7" NAME="7b">7)</A></SUP>
      This formula of Marx is not only applicable to capitalist production, but
      universally applicable in general. If we consider the case of the ancient
      slaveholding economy, each production cycle in it will be accompanied by
      the slaveholders' receiving his share and the slave his; in the next
      cycle, the slaveholder will also discharge his role, while the slave will
      discharge his; if reproduction should expand, the sole alteration will be
      in the fact that the share and power of the slaveholder, the number of his
      slaves, the amount of surplus labor produced by them, will become greater.
      Thus, the process of material production is simultaneously a process of
      the reproduction of those production relations, of that historical
      envelope, in which they are operative. On the other hand, the process of
      material reproduction is a process of constant reproduction of the
      corresponding labor forces. &quot;Man himself,&quot; writes Marx, &quot;viewed
      as the impersonation of labor power, is a natural object, a thing,
      although a living conscious thing, and labor is the manifestation of this
      power residing in him.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#8" NAME="8b">8)</A></SUP>
      But at various historical periods, in accordance with the social
      technique, the mode of production, etc., specific labor forces, i.e.,
      labor forces with the required skill, are available. The process of
      reproduction is constantly reproducing this skill; it therefore reproduces
      not only the things, but also the &quot;living things&quot;, i.e., workers
      possessing certain qualifications; it also reproduces relations among them
      with expanding reproduction, it makes the adjustments corresponding to the
      new level of the productive forces, in this case assigning the persons,
      who may not be the same (for new types of skill, new &quot;living machines&quot;
      are required), to posts in the labor field which may not be identical. But
      the fundamental texture of the production relations nevertheless remains
      intact (except in the case of revolutionary periods) and continues to be
      reproduced on a progressively larger and larger scale.</P>
    
    <P>If the totality of the various types of skill of the labor forces be
      designated as a social physiology, it may be said that the process of
      reproduction is constantly reproducing the economy of society and
      therefore also its physiology.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">All types of work have thus far required a specific
      physiological type, a result of specialization. We may therefore
      distinguish - even by his external appearance - a transport worker from a
      metal works clerk, butcher, stool-pigeon, etc., not to mention a musician
      or a member of the &quot;liberal professions&quot; in general. Therefore,
      not only is the psychology of men their social psychology, but their
      physiological structure is a product of social evolution. As he works upon
      nature, man alters his own nature. What we call &quot;social physiology&quot;
      may not be considered as opposed to economy, for it is a part of economy.
      The difference simply is this: in discussing economy, we analyze the
      connections and the type of these connections between men, their: material
      relation with each other, what we call social physiology is not a
      connection, but a property of these same elements.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Simultaneously with the process of reproduction, we have a similar
      motion of the entire vast machine of social life: the mutual relations
      between classes are reproduced, also the conditions of the state
      organization; also the relations within the various spheres of ideological
      labor. In this aggregate reproduction of the entire social life, the <I>social
      contradictions </I>are also constantly reproduced. The partial
      contradictions, a disturbance of equilibrium emanating from the impulses
      imparted by the evolution of the productive forces, are being constantly
      absorbed by a partial realignment of society within the frame of the given
      mode of production. But the <I>basic </I>contradictions, those arising
      from the very nature of the given economic structure, continue to be
      reproduced on a larger and larger foundation, until they attain the
      proportions that bring about a catastrophe. Then the entire old form of
      production relations will collapse, and a new form arises, if the social
      evolution continues. &quot;The historical development of the antagonisms,
      immanent in a given form of production, is the only way in which that form
      of production can be dissolved and a new form established.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#9" NAME="9b">9)</A></SUP>
      This moment is succeeded by a temporary interruption in the process of
      reproduction, a disturbance which is expressed by the destruction of a
      portion of the productive forces. The general transformation of the entire
      human labor apparatus, the reorganization of all the human relations,
      brings about a new equilibrium, whereupon society enters upon a new
      universal cycle in its evolution, by extending its technical basis and
      accumulating its experience (as congealed in objects), which serves as the
      point of departure in any new forward step.</P>
