    <H4>a. The Uniformity of Phenomena in General and of Social Phenomena in
    Particular</H4>
    
    <P>If we regard the phenomena of nature which surround us, as well as those
      of social life, we shall observe that these phenomena by no means
      constitute a confused mass in which nothing may be distinguished or
      understood or predicted. On the other hand, we may everywhere ascertain,
      by attentive observation, a certain regularity in these phenomena. Night
      is followed by day; and, just as inevitably, day is followed by night. The
      seasons regularly follow one upon the other, accompanied by a great number
      of concomitant phenomena, repeating themselves year after year; the trees
      put forth their leaves and shed them; various kinds of birds of passage
      fly into our country and out again; men sow or reap; etc. Whenever a warm
      rain falls, mushrooms grow up in profusion, and we even have a saying, &quot;to
      grow like mushrooms after a rain.&quot; A grain of rye, falling upon the
      ground, will strike root and the plant under certain circumstances will
      ultimately produce an ear of grain. But we have never observed that any
      such ear grew - let us say - out of frogs' eggs or from bits of sandstone.
      Everything in nature, therefore, from the movements of the planets down to
      the little grain or mushroom, is subject to a certain uniformity or, as it
      is generally put, to a certain <I>natural law.</I></P>
    
    <P>We observe the same condition in social life also, i.e., in the life of
      human society. However complicated and varied this society may be, we
      nevertheless observe and discover in it a certain natural law. For
      example, wherever capitalism develops (in America or in Japan, in Africa
      or in Australia), the working class also grows and expands, likewise the
      socialist movement; the theory of Marxism is spread. Together with the
      growth of production there is a growth in &quot;mental culture&quot;: in
      the number of persons able to read and write, for example. In capitalist
      society, crises arise at definite intervals of time, which follow upon
      industrial booms in as precise a succession as the succession of day and
      night. The bringing out of any great invention which revolutionizes
      technology also speedily alters the entire social life. Or, let us take
      another example; let us count the number of persons born every year in a
      certain country: we shall see that in the following year the increase in
      the population by percentage will be approximately the same. Let us
      calculate the quantity of beer consumed each year in Bavaria; we shall
      find that this quantity is more or less constant, increasing with the
      increase in population. If there were no uniformity, no natural law, it is
      of course clear that nothing could be predicted, nothing could be done.
      Day might follow upon night today, and then there might be daylight for a
      whole year. This year, snow might fall in winter, while next winter
      oranges might grow. In England, the working class might grow up by the
      side of capitalism, while in Japan the number of landowners might perhaps
      increase. Now we bake bread in an oven but then - why not? - perhaps
      loaves of bread will grow on pine trees instead of cones.</P>
    
    <P>As a matter of fact, however, no one has any such thoughts, every one
      well knows that loaves of bread will not grow on pine-trees. Every one has
      observed that in nature and society there is a <I>definite </I>regularity,
      a <I>fixed </I>natural law. The determination of this natural law is the
      first task of science.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This causality in nature and society is objective; it
      exists whether men are aware of it or not. The first step of science is to
      reveal this causality and free it from the surrounding chaos of phenomena.
      Marx considered the earmark of scientific knowledge to be its character as
      &quot;a sum of many determinations and relations&quot;, as opposed to a &quot;chaotic
      conception&quot;. (Introduction to <I>A Critique of Political Economy,
      </I>Chicago, 1913.) This character of science of &quot;systematizing&quot;,
      &quot;coordinating&quot;, &quot;organizing&quot;, etc., is recognized by
      all Thus Mach (in <I>Erkenntnis und Irrtum) </I>defines the process of
      scientific thinking as an adaptation of thoughts to facts and of thoughts
      to thoughts. Karl Pearson, an English professor, writes: &quot;Not the
      facts themselves constitute science, but the method of elaborating them.&quot;
      The original method of science is the &quot;classification&quot; of facts,
      which does not mean a mere collection of facts, but their &quot;systematic
      connection&quot;. (Karl Pearson, <I>Grammar of Science, </I>London, 1892,
      p.15 and 92.) Yet, the great majority of present-day bourgeois
      philosophers find the function of science to be not the discovery of those
      causalities that exist objectively, but the invention of such causalities
      by the human person. But it is clear that the succession of day and night,
      of the seasons, the uniform sequence of natural and social phenomena, are
      independent of whether the mind of the learned bourgeois will have it so
      or not. The causality of phenomena is an objective causality.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><A NAME="b"></A></P>
    
    <H4>b. The Nature of Causation, Formulation of the Question</H4>
    
    <P>If uniformity, as stated above, may be observed in the phenomena of
      nature and society, we may well ask what is this uniformity? When we
      examine the mechanism of a watch and note its precise operation, when we
      observe how beautifully the little wheels have been adjusted one with
      regard to the other, each tooth meshing with another, we are fully aware
      why the mechanism works as it does. Watches are made on a <I>definite
      plan</I>; this instrument has been constructed for a definite end; each
      screw has been put in its place precisely for the attainment of this end.
      Similarly, in the great universe, the planets move regularly and smoothly
      in their courses; nature wisely preserves the specially developed forms of
      life. We have only to regard the construction of the eye of any animal in
      order to observe at once how cunningly and skilfully, with what practical
      <I>planfulness </I>this eye has been constructed. And everything in
      nature seems informed with a plan: the mole, living under the surface of
      the ground, has little blind eyes, but very excellent hearing; while the
      deep-sea fish against whose body the weight of the water is pressing,
      resists this pressure by an equal pressure from within (if taken out of
      the water, the fish will burst), etc. And how is it in human society? Does
      not humanity propose a great goal for itself; namely, communism? Does not
      the entire evolution of history move toward this great goal? Therefore, if
      everything in nature and in society has an object, which may not in every
      case be known to us, but which consists in an eternal process of
      perfection, should we not consider all things from the point of view of
      these goals? In this case, the natural law condition of which we have
      spoken will appear to be a condition of <I>purposeful </I>natural law (or
      of <I>teleological </I>natural law; from the Greek <I>telos, </I>&quot;goal&quot;,
      &quot;purpose&quot;). This is one of two possibilities, one of the ways in
      which the question as to the character of natural law may be formulated.</P>
    
    <P>Another formulation of the question starts with the fact that every
      phenomenon has its <I>cause. </I>Humanity moves toward communism for the
      reason that the proletariat has grown up within capitalist society and
      this proletariat cannot be accommodated in the framework of this society:
      the mole has poor sight and excellent hearing because in the course of
      thousands of years the natural circumstances have been exerting their
      influence on these animals, and the changes called forth by these
      circumstances have been handed down to their offspring; those animals
      which were more adapted to these circumstances finding it easier to
      continue to live, to reproduce and to multiply, than those less adapted to
      the changes. Day is followed by night, and vice-versa, because the earth
      revolves about its axis and turns to the sun now one side and now the
      other. In all these cases we do not ask for the <I>purpose </I>(&quot;for
      what end?&quot;), but we ask for the <I>cause </I>(&quot;why?&quot;).
      This is the <I>causal </I>(from Latin <I>causa, </I>&quot;cause&quot;)
      formulation of the question. The natural law of phenomena is here
      represented as a law of <I>cause and effect.</I></P>
    
    <P>Such is the nature of the conflict between causality and teleology. We
      must dispose of this conflict at once.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="c"></A></P>
    
    <H4>c. Teleology and Objections to Teleology, Immanent Teleology</H4>
    
    <P>If we consider teleology as a general principle, <I>i.e., </I>if we
      closely examine this view, according to which everything in the world is
      subject to certain purposes, it will not be difficult to grasp its
      complete absurdity. After all, what is a goal? The conception of a goal
      presupposes the conception of some one who sets this goal as a <I>goal,
      i.e., </I>who sets it <I>consciously. </I>There is no such thing as a
      purpose apart from him who conceives the purpose. A stone does not set any
      goals for itself, any more than does the sun, or any of the planets, or
      the entire solar system, or the Milky Way. A purpose is an idea which can
      be associated only with conscious living creatures, having desires,
      representing these desires to them selves as goals, and aspiring to the
      realization of these desires (in other words, to &quot;approach&quot; a
      certain &quot;goal&quot;). Only a savage may ask the purpose pursued by a
      stone lying by the wayside. The savage imputes a soul to nature and to the
      stone. Therefore, &quot;teleology&quot; is dominant in his mind, and the
      stone acts in the manner of a conscious human being. The advocates of
      teleology are similar to this savage, for in their minds the entire world
      has a purpose, this purpose having been set by some unknown being. It is
      clear from the above that the <I>conception of purpose, of planfulness,
      etc., is absolutely inapplicable to the world as a whole, and that the
      natural law of phenomena is not a teleological natural law.</I></P>
    


    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is not difficult to trace the roots of the conflict
      between the adherents of teleology and those of causality. Ever since
      human society has been divided into groups, some of which (the minority)
      rule, command, control, while the others are ruled, and obey, them, men
      have been disposed to measure the entire world by this standard. As the
      earth holds kings, judges, rulers, etc., who make laws, pronounce
      judgments, impose punishments, so the universe has a celestial king, a
      celestial judge, his heavenly host, generals (arch-strategists). The
      universe has been conceived as a product of the creative will
      which-appropriately enough gives serious attention to fixing the goals it
      has in mind, its &quot;divine plan&quot;. The causality in phenomena has
      been taken to be an expression of this divine will. Aristotle went so far
      as to say: &quot;Nature is the goal&quot; (<I>&#942; &delta;&#941; &Phi;&#944;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;
&tau;&#941;&lambda;&sigma;&sigmaf; &#941;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&upsilon;
)</I>.
      Greek nomos (<I>&upsilon;&#972;&mu;&sigma;&sigmaf; &quot;law&quot;</I>)
      meant both a &quot;natural law&quot; and a &quot;moral law&quot;
      (commandment, standard of conduct), as well as order, planfulness,
      harmony.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">As the omnipotence of the emperors was extended, the
      jurisprudence of ancient Rome also was transformed into a worldly study of
      divinity. Its further development proceeded hand in hand with dogmatic
      theology. Law now simply meant a standard (rule of conduct: <I>- N.B.),
      </I>emanating from the supreme power - the celestial imperator, in
      theology; the terrestrial God, in jurisprudence - and prescribing a
      certain conduct for its creatures. (E. Spektorsky: <I>Sketches on the
      Philosophy of the Social Sciences, </I>Series I,<I> The Social Sciences
      and Theoretical Philosophy</I>, in Russian, Warsaw, 1907, p. 158.) The
      system of causalities in nature began to be regarded as a system of divine
      legislation. The famous Kepler thought the corporeal universe had its
      pandects (Emperor Justinian's codes of law were called <I>pandects</I>).
      Such conceptions are also found at later periods, for instance, the French
      physiocrats in the Eighteenth Century furnished the first masterful
      outline of capitalist society and confused the causality of natural and
      social phenomena with the laws of the state and the decrees of the divine
      powers. Thus, François Quesnay writes: &quot;The fundamental social
      laws are the laws of the natural order, which are most <I>advantageous
      </I>for the human race . . . . These laws were <I>fixed </I>by the
      creator for all time. Obedience to these . . . (i<I>.e., </I>`divine',
      `immutable'. <i>N. B.) </i>laws must be maintained by the
      tutelary authority <I>(autorité tutélaire).&quot; </I>(F.
      Quesnay: <I>Despotisme de la Chine, </I>chap. viii, par. 1, 2, <I>Oeuvres,
      </I>Francfort, 1888, p.637). Obviously, the laws of the tutelary authority
      (<I>i.e.</I>, the bourgeois policeman) are here skilfully made to depend
      on the &quot;divine creator&quot; for the support of whom they were
      created.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Numerous other examples might be adduced, all going to
      show the same thing, namely, that the teleological standpoint is based on
      religion. In its origin, this standpoint is a crude and barbarous transfer
      of the earthly relations of slavery and submission, on the one hand, and
      domination on the other, to the universe as a whole. It fundamentally
      contradicts a scientific explanation, and is based on faith alone. No
      matter what fragrant sauce may be served with it, it remains a priestly
      point of view.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>But how shall we then explain a number of phenomena in which the &quot;purpose&quot;
      is obvious to the naked eye (the &quot;planfulness&quot; of the
      construction of certain organs, social progress, the perfection of animal
      forms, of the human form, etc.)? If we assume a crudely teleological point
      of view and invoke God Almighty and his &quot;plan&quot;, the folly of
      this &quot;explanation&quot; will become at once apparent. Therefore, the
      teleological point of view assumes a more attenuated form in certain
      persons - he form of the doctrine of the so called &quot;immanent
      teleology&quot; (a purposefulness inherent in the phenomena of nature and
      society).</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Before investigating this question, it is worth while
      to devote a few words to religious explanations. An intelligent bourgeois
      economist, Böhm-Bawerk, gives the following example. Let us assume,
      he says, that I have set up a theory to explain the universe, according to
      which it consists of a countless number of little devils, whose writhings
      and contortions produce all the phenomena in nature. These little devils,
      I add, are invisible and inaudible, may not be detected by the sense of
      smell nor seized by their tails. I defy anyone to refute this &quot;theory&quot;.
      It cannot be refuted outright, for I have fortified it by assuming the
      invisibility and intangibility of these little devils; yet everyone will
      recognize that it is humbug, for the simple reason that there is no proof
      of the correctness of such a conception.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Of like nature are all the religious pseudo-explanations. They are
      intrenched behind the intangibility of mysterious powers, or the essential
      insufficiency of our reason. A father of the Church has set up the
      following principle: &quot;I believe, because it is absurd&quot; <I>(Credo
      quid absurdum). </I>According to the Christian doctrine, God is one, but
      also three, which contradicts the rudiments of the multiplication table.
      But it is declared that &quot;our weak reason cannot comprehend this
      mystery.&quot; Obviously, the most ridiculous absurdities can be covered
      by such considerations.</P>
    
    <P>This doctrine rejects the idea of a mysterious power, in the crude sense
      of the word. It speaks only of goals which are constantly being revealed
      by the course of events, of goals inherent in the very process of
      evolution. Let us clarify this conception by means of an example. Let us
      consider a certain type of animal. In the course of time, this type, by
      reason of a number of causes, alters and adapts itself to nature more and
      more. Its organs are constantly being perfected, <I>i.e., </I>they are
      progressing. Or, let us consider human society. No matter how we imagine
      the future of this society to be (whether this future will be socialism,
      or any other form of society), is it not apparent that the human type is
      growing, that man is becoming more &quot;cultivated&quot;, that he is &quot;perfecting
      himself&quot;, and that we, the lords of creation, are advancing on the
      road of civilization and progress? Precisely as the structure of the
      animal is becoming better adapted to its purpose, so also is society
      becoming more perfected in its structure, <I>i.e., </I>more adapted to
      plan. Here the goal (perfection) is revealed in the course of evolution.
      It is not designed in advance by divinity, but blows forth like the rose
      from its blossom, simultaneously the development of this blossom into the
      rose, by virtue of certain causes.</P>
    
    <P>Is this theory a correct one? No, it is not. It is merely a disguised
      and attenuated form of the teleological fallacy.</P>
    
    <P>First, we must oppose the conception of a goal that is set by no one.
      This would be equivalent to speaking of thoughts without assuming a
      thinking means, or to speaking of wind in a region in which there is no
      air, or of moisture in a place where there is no fluid. As a matter of
      fact, when people speak of purposes that are &quot;inherent&quot; in
      something, they are often simultaneously and tacitly assuming the
      existence of an extremely delicate and inscrutable internal force, to
      which the setting of the purpose must be assigned. This mysterious force
      has on the surface but little similarity with the god who is crudely
      represented as a gray-haired old man with a beard and mustaches; but at
      bottom the god is again invisibly present, completely enveloped, however,
      by the most ingenious instruments of thought. We are again dealing with
      the same teleological theory which we discussed above. Teleology (the
      doctrine of purpose) leads straight into Theology (the doctrine of God).</P>
    
    <P>But let us return now to immanent teleology in its pure form. For this
      purpose it is best to discuss the idea of a general progress (a general
      perfection), on which the advocates of immanent teleology chiefly lean for
      their support.</P>
    
    <P>Every one will recognize that it is more difficult to overthrow the
      teleological point of view in this case, for the &quot;divine&quot;
      element is here hidden in the background, as it were. However, it is not
      difficult to ascertain the facts of the case if we regard the entire
      process of evolution as a whole, i.e., if we consider not only those forms
      and types (animals, plants, peoples, inorganic portions of nature), which
      have survived, but also those which have been destroyed, and those which
      are being destroyed. Is it true that this much vaunted progress is being
      accomplished in the case of all the forms? It is not true. There were once
      mammoths, now there are none; within our own memories the buffalo has died
      out; and, in general, we may say that an endless multitude of living types
      of all kinds have perished forever. With human groups, the tale is the
      same; where are now the Incas and the Aztecs, who once lived in America?
      Where is the Assyro-Babylonian system of society? the Cretan civilization?
      the ancient Greek? Where is ancient Rome, ruler of the world? All these
      societies have perished; their existence is a thing of the past. But a few
      of the countless multitude have survived and &quot;perfected&quot;
      themselves. &quot;Progress&quot; then simply means that-let us say-against
      ten thousand combinations, which were unfavorable for development, we have
      one or two combinations that were favorable to development.</P>
    
    <P>If we bear in mind only the favorable conditions and the favorable
      results, everything will of course impress us as being highly planful and
      marvelous (&quot;How wondrously this world is made!&quot;). But our
      friends the immanent teleologists do not look on the reverse side of the
      coin; they do not consider the countless instances of destruction. The
      whole matter reduces itself to the fact that there are conditions that are
      favorable and others that are unfavorable for survival, that under
      favorable conditions we obtain also favorable results, while under
      unfavorable conditions (which is much more frequently the case) we have
      unfavorable results; the whole picture at once loses its divinely planful
      halo, and the teleological fallacy falls of its own weight.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">One of the Russian teleologists, once a Marxist, later
      an orthodox priest and preacher of pogroms under General Wrangel (Sergey
      Bulgakov) writes, in the volume of collected essays called <I>Problems of
      Idealism </I>(in Russian, Moscow, 1902, pp.8, 9): &quot;By the side of the
      conception of evolution, as a <I>colossal and directionless evolution
      </I>(our italics, N.B.), there arises the conception of progress, of
      teleological evolution, in which causality and the gradual unfolding of
      the goal of this evolution overlap to the point of complete identity,
      precisely as in metaphysical systems.&quot; This clearly shows us the
      psychological roots of the seeking after a <I>Weltanschauung </I>that
      shows purpose. The soul of the discontented bourgeois, feeling insecure,
      longs for consolation. The course of evolution actually operative
      displeases him because it is not guided by a saving reason, a goal of
      deliverance. It is so much more pleasant to take a nap after a good meal,
      and to know that there is one who watches over us.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is unnecessary to point out that the apparently
      teleological elements in the formulations of Marx and Engels are to be
      understood merely as a metaphoric, esthetic mode of expression; when Marx
      speaks of <I>value </I>as congealed muscle, nerves, etc., only malicious
      opponents of the workers, like P. Struve, will take this figure of speech
      literally, and look for real muscles.</FONT></P>

    <H4>d. Teleology in the Social Sciences</H4>
    
    <P>When we speak of the teleological point of view in its application to
      inanimate nature, or to animals aside from man, the incorrectness and
      folly of this point of view are evident. How can there be a purposeful law
      of nature, when there is no purpose! But the matter is quite different
      when we speak of society and of human beings. The stone sets no goal for
      itself; the giraffe is doubtful on this point; but man differs from the
      other portions of nature precisely by virtue of the fact that he does
      pursue definite purposes. Marx formulates this difference as follows: &quot;A
      spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts
      to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells. But what
      distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the
      architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in
      reality. At the end of every labor-process, we get a result that already
      existed in the imagination of the laborer at its commencement. He not only
      effects a change of form in the material on which he works, but he also
      realizes a purpose of his own that gives the law to his modus operandi,
      and to which he must subordinate his will. And this subordination is no
      mere momentary act. Besides the exertion of the bodily organs, the process
      demands that, during the whole operation, the workman's will be steadily
      in consonance with his purpose. This means close attention.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP>
      Marx here draws a sharp line between man and the rest of nature, and he is
      right in doing this, for the thesis that man sets himself goals. Let us no
      one can deny see what are the inferences drawn from this fact by the
      adherents of the &quot;teleological method&quot; in social science.</P>
    
    <P>For this purpose let us consider the views of our most prominent
      opponent, the German scholar Rudolf Stammler, who some time ago published
      a large book in opposition to Marxism under the title: &quot;Economics and
      Law from the Standpoint of the Materialistic Interpretation of History&quot;
      <I>(Wirtschaft and Recht nach der materiulistischen Geschichtsauffassung,
      </I>second edition).</P>
    
    <P>What, asks Stammler, is the substance of the social sciences? He
      answers: The social sciences concern themselves with social phenomena. And
      social phenomena are distinguished by certain peculiarities which are not
      present in phenomena of any other kind. For this reason special (social)
      sciences are necessary. Now, what is the special characteristic, the
      special token, of social phenomena? Stammler answers as follows: the
      earmark of the social phenomenon is in the fact that it is regulated from
      an external standpoint, or, more definitely, by the norms of law (laws,
      decrees ordinances, regulations, etc.). Where there is no such regulation,
      no practice of law, there is no society. But where there is a society,
      this means that the life of such a society is conducted within a certain
      framework, and adapts itself to this framework as molten metal adapts
      itself to the mould.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Stammler's precise words are: &quot;This (determining.
      - N. B.) factor is the regulation by men of their intercourse and their
      life together. The <I>external </I>regulation of human conduct in mutual
      relations is the necessary prerequisite of a social life as a specific
      goal. It is the <I>ultimate factor, </I>to which all <I>social </I>thought
      must formally be traced back in its peculiarities as such&quot; (p. 83).</FONT></P>
    
    <P>But if it is the distinguishing characteristic of social phenomena that
      they are subject to regulation, says Stammler, it is perfectly clear that
      the law of nature in social life is a <I>purposeful </I>law of nature. As
      a matter of fact, who &quot;regulates&quot;, and what is the meaning of &quot;regulation&quot;?
      <I>Men </I>regulate, by creating definite norms (rules of conduct) for
      the attainment of definite <I>purposes, </I>which are also consciously
      formulated by <I>men. </I>It follows, according to Stammler, that there
      is a tremendous difference between nature and society, between social
      evolution and evolution in nature (social life, according to Stammler, is
      something that is directly &quot;opposed to nature&quot;)<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#2" NAME="2b">2)</A></SUP>
      and consequently also between the natural sciences (<I>Naturwissenschaften</I>)
      and the sciences concerned with society. The social sciences are <I>sciences
      with a purpose </I>(<I>Zweckwissenschaften</I>); the natural sciences
      consider all things from the standpoint of <I>cause and effect.</I></P>
    
    <P>Is this point of view a correct one? Is it true that there are two kinds
      of sciences, some of which are as remote from the others as the heavens
      from the earth? No, it is not true. And now for the reason.</P>
    
    <P>Let us agree for a moment that the fundamental characteristic of society
      actually is the fact that men consciously regulate their relations with
      each other by means of law. Would it follow that we may never ask
      ourselves why people regulate these relations at a certain time and in a
      certain place in one way, while they order them quite differently in
      another place and at another time? For example, the bourgeois German
      Republic in 1919 and 1920 regulated social relations by shooting the
      workers; the Soviet Proletarian Republic regulates these relations by
      shooting counter-revolutionary capitalists; the legislation of bourgeois
      governments pursues the goal of strengthening, extending, perpetuating the
      rule of capital; the decrees of the proletarian state pursue the goal of
      overthrowing the rule of capital and safeguarding the rule of labor. Now,
      if we should wish to understand scientifically, <I>i.e., </I>to explain
      these phenomena, would it be sufficient simply to say that the purposes
      are different? Everyone will at once see that this would not be
      sufficient, for everyone will ask: but why, why should &quot;men&quot; in
      one case set themselves one goal, and in another case a different goal?
      This brings us face to face with the answer: because in the one case the
      proletariat is in power, in the other case the bourgeoisie; the
      bourgeoisie desires one thing, because the conditions of its life cause it
      to have one set of desires; but the conditions of the life of the workers
      cause them to have a different set of wishes, etc. In a word, as soon as
      we wish really to understand social phenomena, we immediately find
      ourselves asking the question: &quot;why?&quot; i.e., we ask concerning
      the <I>causes </I>of these phenomena, in spite of the fact that these
      phenomena may be the expressions of certain human purposes. In other
      words, even if men should regulate everything consciously, and even if
      everything should be accomplished in society just as these men desire, we
      should still need an explanation of social phenomena, not teleology, but a
      consideration of the causes of the phenomena, i.e., the determination of a
      cause and effect relation, as their law. And for this reason. there is no
      difference at all in this regard between the social sciences and the
      sciences concerned with nature.</P>
    
    <P>If we consider the matter well, it is at once apparent that it could not
      be otherwise. As a matter of fact is not man himself, is not any specific
      human society, a portion of nature? Is not the human race a portion of the
      animal world? Anyone denying this is ignorant of the very rudiments of
      present-day science. But if man and human society are portions of nature
      as a whole, it would really be very remarkable to find that this portion
      is in complete contradiction with the rest of nature. It is not difficult
      to see that the advocates of teleology here again display the thought of
      the divine nature of man, <I>i.e., </I>the naive thought already
      discussed above.</P>
    
    <P>We have thus become aware of the complete fallacy of the teleological
      standpoint, even if we should admit that the basic characteristic of
      society is its external regulation (law). Even here teleology does not &quot;hold
      water&quot;. Besides, in the last analysis, &quot;external regulation&quot;
      is not the most fundamental trait of society. Almost all the societies
      that have existed, to the present day (particularly capitalist society)
      have been distinguished precisely by the absence of any regulation, by
      their anarchy. In the great mass of social phenomena, any regulation that
      positively regulates in the manner desired by the law-givers, has never
      played a very decisive part. And how about the future (communist) society?
      In that society, there will be no &quot;external&quot; (legal) regulation
      at all. For the class-conscious population that has been trained in the
      spirit of workers' solidarity will not be in need of any external pressure
      (we shall discuss these questions in detail in the following chapter). In
      other words, even from this point of view Stammler's theory is of no
      avail, and the sole correct method for a scientific consideration of
      social phenomena remains that based on the law of cause and effect.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Stammler's theory clearly shows the ideology of the
      capitalist state official, which seeks to perpetuate essentially temporary
      conditions. State and law are in reality products of class society, whose
      parts are in constant, sometimes very bitter, struggle with each other.
      Doubtless the legal standards and the state organization of the ruling
      class were a condition for the existence of this society. But it is
      precisely in a classless society that the picture changes completely. We
      may not therefore regard a relation of historically changeable nature
      (state, law) as a permanent attribute of all society.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Furthermore, Stammler overlooks the following
      condition. Very frequently it happens that the laws and standards of the
      state power, whereby the ruling class seeks to attain certain results, in
      reality by reason of a blind evolution, and the social anarchy lead to
      entirely different results than those originally aimed at. The World War
      is an excellent example; with the aid of state measures (mobilization of
      army and navy, military actions under the leadership of the state
      authority, etc.), the bourgeoisie of the various countries imagined it
      would attain certain definite goals. But the actual outcome was the
      revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Apparently,
      Stammler's pious teleological point of view will not work here. His basic
      error is in overestimating the element of &quot;regulation&quot;, and
      under estimating the elemental course of evolution, and all his
      lucubrations are therefore devoid of any foundation.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><A NAME="e"></A></P>
    
    <H4>e. Causality and Teleology; Scientific Explanations are Causal
    Explanations</H4>
    
    <P>It follows from the above that whenever we wish to explain a certain
      phenomenon - and this includes any phenomenon of social life - we must
      inevitably seek its cause. All the efforts of the teleological
      pseudo-explanation are at bottom only expressions of religious belief and
      cannot explain anything. We may therefore answer the fundamental question
      as to whether the inherent law in the phenomena of nature and society, the
      uniformity which we observe in these fields, is teleological or causal:
      <I>Both in nature and in society there exists objectively </I>(i.e., <I>regardless
      of whether we wish it or not, whether we are conscious of it or not) a law
      of nature that is causal in character.</I></P>
    
    <P>What constitutes such a law of cause and effect? Such a law is a
      necessary, inevitable, invariable and universal relation between
      phenomena; if, for example, the temperature of a body rises, its volume
      will increase; if fluids are heated to a sufficient extent, they will be
      transformed into vapors; if immense quantities of paper money are issued,
      far exceeding normal requirements, they will become worthless; if
      capitalism exists, there will necessarily be wars from time to time; if in
      any country there is a small-scale production by the side of a large-scale
      production, the large-scale production will ultimately be the victor; if
      the proletariat launches an attack on capital, capital will defend itself
      with all its might; if the productivity of labor increases, prices will
      fall; if a certain amount of poison be introduced into the human organism,
      it will die, etc., etc. In a word it may be said that any law of cause and
      effect may be expressed by the following formula: <I>If certain phenomena
      are actually present, there must necessarily be also present certain other
      phenomena corresponding to them. </I>The explanation of any phenomenon
      means the finding of its cause, in other words, the finding of a certain
      other phenomenon on which it depends, <I>i.e., </I>the explanation of the
      <I>cause and effect relation </I>between the phenomena. As long as this
      relation is not determined, the phenomenon has not been explained. Once
      this relation has been found, once it has been discovered and verified
      that this relation is really a constant one, we are dealing with a
      scientific (causal) explanation. This mode of explanation is the sole
      explanation that is scientific, both in the phenomena of nature and in
      those of social life. This method of explanation completely rejects
      divinity; it completely rejects any use of supernatural forces, any appeal
      to the time-worn trumpery of the past, and opens up the road for man to
      obtain a true control both over the forces of nature and his own social
      forces.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Many oppose the conception of causality and law in
      nature with the argument that (as we have seen) this conception is itself
      the result of an erroneous assumption of a celestial lawgiver. No
      doubt that is the origin of the idea, but the idea has left its origin far
      behind. Language presents many cases of such evolution. When we say, for
      example, &quot;the sun has come up&quot;, &quot;the sun has gone down&quot;,
      of course we do not believe that the sun has actually &quot;come&quot;, or
      &quot;gone&quot;, as a man comes or goes, on two legs, but that was
      probably the original conception. Similarly, in the case of the word &quot;law&quot;,
      we may say that &quot;a law prevails&quot;, or &quot;applies&quot;, which
      by no means signifies that the two phenomena (cause and effect) involve
      any third invisible little god, lodged in the cause, reins in hand. The
      causal relation is merely the constantly observable connection between
      phenomena. This conception of causality is perfectly in accord with
      science.</FONT></P>
