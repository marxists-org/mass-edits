    <H4>a. Nature as the Environment of Society</H4>
    
    <P>A consideration of society as a system involves the recognition of &quot;external
      nature&quot; as its environment, i.e., chiefly the terrestrial globe with
      all its natural properties. Human society is unthinkable without its
      environment. Nature is the source of foodstuffs for human society, thus
      determining the latter's living conditions. But nothing could be more
      incorrect than to regard nature from the teleological point of view: man,
      the lord of creation, with nature created for his use, and all things
      adapted to human needs. As a matter of fact, nature often falls upon the &quot;lord
      of creation&quot; in such a savage manner that he is obliged to admit her
      superiority. It has taken man centuries of bitter struggle to place his
      iron bit in nature's mouth.</P>
    
    <P>Now man, as an animal form, as well as human society, are products of
      nature, parts of this great, endless whole. Man can never escape from
      nature, and even when he &quot;controls&quot; nature, he is merely making
      use of the laws <I>of nature </I>for his own ends. It is therefore clear
      how great must be the influence of nature on the whole development of
      human society. Before proceeding to a study of the relations existing
      between nature and man, or of the forms in which nature operates on human
      society, we must consider first of all with what phases of nature man
      comes chiefly in contact. We have only to look about us in order to
      perceive the dependence of society on nature: &quot;The soil (and this,
      economically speaking, includes water) in the virgin state in which it
      supplies man with necessaries or the means of subsistence ready to hand,
      exists independently of him, and is the universal subject of human labor.
      All those things which labor merely separates from immediate connection
      with their environment, are subjects of labor spontaneously provided by
      nature. Such are fish which we catch and take from their element water,
      timber which we fell in the virgin forest, and ores which we extract from
      their veins &quot; As the earth is his original larder, so too it is his
      original tool house. It supplies him, for instance, with stones for
      throwing, grinding, pressing, cutting, etc.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP>
      Nature is the <I>immediate </I>object of labor in the acquisitive
      industries (mining, hunting, portions of agriculture, etc.). In other
      words, nature determines what raw materials are to be manipulated. Man, as
      we have seen above, is constantly making use of the laws of nature in his
      struggle with her. &quot;He makes use of the mechanical, physical and
      chemical properties of some bodies in order to make other substances
      subservient with his aims:&quot; <SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#2" NAME="2b">2)</A></SUP>
      Man makes use of the power of steam, electricity, etc., the attraction of
      the earth for bodies (law of gravitation), etc. It is impossible,
      therefore, for the <I>state of nature </I>at a certain place and at a
      certain time not to act upon human society. Climate (quantity of moisture,
      winds, temperature, etc.), configuration of surface (hills or valleys,
      distribution of water, character of rivers, presence of metals, minerals,
      all the resources buried in the earth), the character of the shore (in the
      case of a maritime community), the distribution of land and water, the
      presence of various animals and plants, etc., such are the chief elements
      of nature that influence human society. Whales and fish may not be caught
      on land; agriculture may not be pursued on rocky mountains; deserts are a
      poor place for forestry; you cannot live in tents in cold countries during
      the winter, nor do you heat your but in hot weather ... if no metals are
      in the ground, you cannot conjure them down from heaven or suck them out
      of your finger-tips, etc.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In detail, the influence of nature is found expressed
      in the following conditions:</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>Distribution of land and water. </I>In general, man
      is a land animal; the ocean therefore has a double influence: it divides:
      and, on the other hand, furnishes a transportation route. The former
      influence is earlier than the latter. The influence of the coast-line is
      chiefly in its possessing - or not possessing - good harbors. With few
      exceptions (Cherbourg, for instance), modern seaports are established
      where the natural curves of the seacoast provide natural harbors. The
      surface of the earth, whose influence on man is felt through the animal
      and vegetable kingdoms, has also a more direct influence - varying greatly
      in accordance with the stage in evolution - by determining the nature and
      direction of transportation routes (paths, highways, railroads, tunnels,
      etc.).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>Stones and minerals. </I>Construction work depends
      on the nature of the available stone quarries. In mountainous regions, the
      hard varieties (for instance, porphyry, basalt, etc.) predominate; in
      valleys, softer varieties. The importance of minerals and metals has
      increased particularly in recent days (iron, coal). Certain minerals
      furnish the principal reason for the migration of nations, as well as
      colonization. (The presence of tin lured the Phoenicians northward; gold
      drew them to South Africa and East India; gold and silver brought the
      Spaniards to America.) The centers of modern heavy industry are determined
      by the location of deposits of iron ore and coal. The character of the
      soil, together with the climate, have their influence on the vegetable
      kingdom.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>Continental bodies of water. </I>Water is of value,
      in the first place, for drinking purposes (therefore it is so precious in
      the desert); second, we have its significance for agriculture (the soil -
      depending on the amount of water in it - must be drained or irrigated). It
      is well known how significant are the inundations of the great rivers
      (Nile, Ganges, etc.) for agriculture, and how great was the influence of
      this circumstance on the ancient Egyptians and East Indians. Water is also
      important as motive power (water-mills are among the earliest inventions;
      therefore, cities arose in close proximity to regions rich in water; more
      recently, the utilization of water power in electrification may be
      mentioned, the so called `white coal,&quot; now widely exploited in
      America, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Italy). Finally, there is the fact
      that water furnishes transportation routes, which some scholars consider
      its most important function.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>The Climate's </I>influence is chiefly through its
      effect on production. The species of plants to be cultivated depend on the
      climate, which also determines the length of the agricultural season (very
      short in Russia; lasting nearly a year in southern countries); labor
      forces are therefore liberated in northern climates, becoming available
      for industry, etc. Climate also has an influence on transportation
      (traffic by sleigh in winter; harbors frozen up or open in winter, also
      rivers, etc.). A cold climate requires a greater quantity of labor devoted
      to nourishment, clothing, housing, artificial heating, etc.; in the north,
      more time is spent indoors; in the south, more in the open air.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>The Flora </I>has a varying influence: at lower
      levels of culture, the paths depended on the nature of the forests
      (inaccessible primeval forests), the species of trees determine the
      character of construction, fuel, etc., also the chase, agriculture, even
      the specific variety of agriculture. The same is true of cattle breeding.
      The <I>fauna, </I>for primitive tribes, constitutes a powerful hostile
      element, serving chiefly for nutrition, in other words, as the object of
      the chase and of fishery; later, there came the taming of beasts, with a
      further effect on production and transportation (draught animals).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>The Ocean </I>has always been of great importance;
      travel and freight are cheaper by sea; the ocean also furnishes the
      theater for many branches of production (fisheries, whaling, sealing,
      etc.). (<I>Cf. A. </I>Hettner: <I>Die geographischen Bedingungen der
      menschlichen Wirtschaft </I>in <I>Grundriss der Nationalökonomik,
      </I>Tübingen 1914.) The influence of climatic conditions may be
      illustrated as follows: in the matter of average annual temperatures (so
      called <I>isotherms </I>on the charts), &quot;it may be observed that the
      greatest populations have congregated between the isotherms of + 16·
      C. and + 4· C. The isotherm + 10· C. coincides pretty closely
      with the central axis of this climatic and cultural zone, and on this
      isotherm lie the richest and most populous cities of the globe: Chicago,
      New York, Philadelphia, London, Vienna, Odessa, Peking; on isotherm + 16·
      we find: St. Louis, Lisbon, Rome, Constantinople, Osaka, Kioto, Tokio; on
      isotherm + 4·, we have: Quebec, Oslo, Stockholm, Leningrad, Moscow.
      Very few cities of more than 100,000 inhabitants are found south of
      isotherm + 16·: Mexico, New Orleans, Cairo, Alexandria, Teheran,
      Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Canton. The northern limit - isotherm + 4·
      - is more sharply drawn; north of it, the only important cities are
      Winnipeg (Canada) and the administrative centers of Siberia.&quot; (L. I.
      Mechnikov: <I>Civilization and the Great Historical Rivers, </I>quoted
      from the Russian edition, Petersburg, 1898, pp.38, 39.)</FONT></P>

    <H4>b. Relations between Society and Nature; the Process of Production and
    Reproduction</H4>
    
    <P>We already know that in any system the cause for alterations in the
      system must be sought in its relations with its environment; also, that
      the fundamental direction of growth (progress, rest, or destruction of the
      system), depends precisely on what the relation is between the given
      system and its environment. An alteration in this relation impels us to
      seek a cause producing a change in the system itself. Where shall we seek
      the constantly changing relations between society and nature?</P>
    
    <P>We have already seen that this changing relation is in the field of
      social labor. As a matter of fact, how does the process of adaptation of
      human society to nature express itself? What is the character of the
      unstable equilibrium between society and nature?</P>
    
    <P>Human society, ever since it began, has had to abstract material energy
      from external nature; without these loans it could not exist. Society best
      adapts itself to nature by abstracting (and appropriating to itself) more
      energy from nature; only by increasing this quantity of energy does
      society succeed in growing. Let us suppose, for example, that on a certain
      day all labor should stop-in factories, machine-shops, mines, on
      railroads, in the forests and fields, by land and sea. Society would not
      be able to maintain itself for a single week, for even in order to live on
      the existing supplies, it would have to transport, forward, and distribute
      them. &quot;Every child knows that any nation would perish of hunger if it
      should stop work, I shall not say for a year, but only for a few weeks.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#3" NAME="3b">3)</A></SUP>
      Men cultivate the ground, raise wheat, rye, maize; they breed and graze
      animals; they raise cotton, hemp and flax; they cut down trees, break
      stone in quarries, and thus satisfy their demands for food, clothing, and
      shelter. They seize coal and iron-ore in the bowels of the earth and
      create great machines of steel, with the aid of which they dig down into
      nature in various directions, changing the entire earth into a gigantic
      workshop, in which men beat with hammers, work at the benches, dig holes
      underground, see to it that the great engines run smoothly, cut tunnels
      through the mountains, cross the oceans in huge ships, bear burdens
      through the air, trace a great network of rails over the earth, lay cables
      at the bottom of the sea-and everywhere, from the noisy city centers to
      the remote country nooks on the earth's surface, they work like beavers
      for their &quot;daily bread&quot;, always by adapting themselves to nature
      and adapting nature to themselves. One part of nature, <I>external </I>nature,
      the part that we are calling the &quot;environment&quot;, is opposed to
      another part, which is human society. And the form of contact between
      these two parts of a single whole is the process of human labor. &quot;Labor
      is, in the first place, a process in which both man and nature
      participate, and in which man of his own accord, starts, regulates, and
      controls the <I>material reactions </I>between <I>himself and nature.
      </I>He opposes himself to nature as one of her own forces.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#4" NAME="4b">4)</A></SUP>
      The immediate contact between society and nature, <I>i.e., </I>the
      abstraction of energy from nature, is a <I>material </I>process. &quot;Man
      sets in motion his arms and legs, head and hands, the natural forces of
      his body, in order to appropriate nature's productions in a form adapted
      to his own wants.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#5" NAME="5b">5)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P>This material process of &quot;metabolism&quot; between society and
      nature is the fundamental relation between environment and system, between
      &quot;external conditions&quot; and human society.</P>
    
    <P>In order that society may continue to live, the process of production
      must be constantly renewed. If we assume that at any moment a certain
      amount of wheat, shoes, shirts, etc., have been produced, and that all
      these are eaten, worn, used up, in the same period, it is clear that
      production must at once repeat its cycle; in fact, it must be constantly
      repeated, each cycle following immediately upon the other. The process of
      production, viewed from the point of view of a repetition of these
      productive cycles, is called the <I>reproductive process. </I>For a
      realization of the reproductive process it is necessary that all its
      material conditions be repeated, for example: for the production of
      textile fabrics, we need looms; for looms we need steel; for steel we need
      iron ore and coal; for transporting the latter substances we need rail,
      roads, and therefore also rails, locomotives, etc., also highways,
      steamers, etc.; warehouses, factory buildings, etc.; in other words, we
      need a long series of material products of the most varied nature. Of
      course, all these material products deteriorate - some faster than others
      - in the process of production; the foodstuffs obtained by the weavers are
      eaten up; the weaving looms wear out; the warehouses become old, need
      overhauling; locomotives get out of repair, cars, the ties, must be
      replaced. In fact, a constant replacement (by new <I>production) </I>of
      worn-out, used up, consumed objects, in all their various material forms,
      is a necessary condition of the process of reproduction. At any given
      moment, human society requires for continuing the progress of reproduction
      a certain quantity of foodstuffs, buildings, mining products, finished
      industrial products, replacement parts for transportation units, etc. All
      these things must be produced if society is not to lower its standard of
      living, beginning with wheat and rye, coal and steel, and ending with
      microscopes and chalk for schools, book-bindings, and news-print paper.
      All these things are a necessary part of the material turnover of society;
      they are the material components of the social process of reproduction.</P>
    
    <P>We therefore regard the metabolism between society and nature as a <I>material
      </I>process, for it deals with material things (objects of labor,
      instruments of labor, and products obtained as a consequence-all are
      material things); on the other hand, the process of labor itself is an
      expenditure of physiological energy, nerve energy, muscular energy, whose
      material expression is in the physical motions of those engaged at work. &quot;If
      we examine the whole process from the point of view of its result, of the
      product, it is plain that both the instruments and the subject of labor,
      are means of production, and that the labor itself is productive labor&quot;.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#6" NAME="6b">6)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Even bourgeois professors, sticking to their &quot;specialty&quot;,
      reluctantly recognize the material character of the process of production.
      Thus, Professor Herkner <I>(Arbeit und Arbeitsteilung</I>, in<I>
      Grundriss der Sozialökonomie</I>, vol. ii, p.170) writes: &quot;An
      investigation of the essence of labor requires the understanding of two
      types of processes &quot; In the first place, bodily labor is expressed in
      certain external movements. The smith's left hand, for instance, seizes
      the red-hot iron with a pair of tongs, placing it on the anvil, while his
      right imparts form to it through blows with the hammer &quot;. The number,
      variety and size of the results of labor may be determined &quot; It is
      possible to describe the entire labor process, as well as the instruments
      of labor used in it,&quot; etc. Herkner calls this labor in the objective
      sense&quot;. On the other hand, the same process may be regarded from the
      point of view of the thoughts and feelings produced in the worker; this is
      labor &quot;in the subjective sense&quot;. Since we are concerned with the
      mutual relation between society and nature, and since this mutual relation
      happens to coincide with <I>objective </I>(material) labor, we may now
      ignore the subjective phase of this process. It is therefore important for
      us to examine the material production of all the material elements
      necessary for the process of reproduction.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">But the fact that instruments of precision, for
      instance, are material things, and that their production is a part of
      material production, necessary in the process of reproduction, does not
      justify the conclusion drawn by Kautsky (Die Neue Zeit, vol. 15, p.233) or
      Cunow (Die Neue Zeit, vol. 39, p. 408) namely, that mathematics and its
      study are a portion of production, merely because they are necessary for
      this production. However, if all persons should suddenly lose the faculty
      of speech, and if there should be no other means of communication aside
      from this lost faculty, it would at once transpire that production also
      would cease. Language therefore is also &quot;necessary&quot; for
      reproduction, like many other elements in any society. Yet it would be
      ridiculous to consider language as a part of production. Nor need we here
      cudgel our brains with another allegedly troublesome question: which came
      first, the chicken or the egg; society or production? This question is an
      absurd one; society is inconceivable without production; production is
      inconceivable without society. But it is important to determine whether
      the alteration in a system is conditioned by the alterations taking place
      between the system and its environment. If so, we must next ask: wherein
      is this alteration to be sought? The answer is: in <I>material </I>labor.
      This mode of formulating the question disposes of most of the &quot;profound&quot;
      objections to historical materialism, and it becomes evident that the &quot;first
      cause&quot; of social evolution is to be found precisely here. But more of
      this later.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>The metabolism between man and nature consists, as we have seen, in the
      transfer of material energy from external nature to society; the
      expenditure of human energy (production) is an extraction of energy from
      nature, energy which is to be <I>added </I>to society (distribution of
      products between the members of society) and <I>appropriated </I>by
      society (consumption) ;this appropriation is the basis for further
      expenditure, etc., the wheel of reproduction being thus constantly in
      motion. Taken as a whole, the process of reproduction therefore includes
      various phases, together constituting a unit, at the bottom of which is
      again the same productive process. It is obvious that human society comes
      most directly into contact with external nature in the process of
      production; it rubs elbows with nature at this point; therefore, within
      the process of reproduction, the productive phase determines also that of
      distribution and consumption.</P>
    
    <P>The process of social production is an adaptation of human society to
      external nature. The process is an active one. When any type of animal
      adapts itself to nature, this type is subject, at bottom, to the constant
      action of its environment. When human society adapts itself to its
      environment, it also adapts the environment to itself, not only becoming
      subject to the action of nature, as a material, but also simultaneously
      transforming nature into a material for human action. For example, when
      certain forms of insects or birds have a coloring similar to that of their
      environment (mimicry), this phenomenon is not a result of any effort on
      the part of these organisms, and certainly not a result of their action on
      external nature. This result was obtained at the price of the destruction
      of countless myriads of individual animals, in the course of many
      thousands of years, with those best adapted surviving and multiplying.
      Human society struggles with nature; man plows the ground, constructs
      roads through impassable forests, conquers the forces of nature, uses them
      for his own ends, changes the whole face of the earth; this is an active,
      not a passive, adaptation, and constitutes one of the basic differences
      between human society and the other types of animals.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This was already well understood by the French
      Physiocrats in the Eighteenth Century. Thus, we find in Nicolas Baudeau (<I>Première
      introduction de la philosophie ècononomique, ou analyse des états
      poliées</I>, 1767<I>, Collection des Economistes et des Réformateurs
      sociaux de France, </I>published by Dubois, Paris, 1910, p.2): &quot;All
      animals are daily attempting to find products produced by nature, <I>i.e.,
      </I>food furnished by the earth itself. Certain species . . . collect
      these commodities and preserve them . . . . Man only, destined (this
      thought is expressed teleologically. N.B.) to investigate the mysteries of
      nature and its fruitfulness, can obtain more useful products than he finds
      on the surface of the earth in its wild and unworked condition. This
      activity (<I>cet art</I>) is perhaps one of man's noblest traits
      on earth.&quot;</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">&quot;Man,&quot; writes the geographer L. Mechnikov
      (op. <I>cit</I>., p.44), &quot;who shares with all other organisms the
      valuable property of adaptation to his environment, dominates all by
      reason of the more precious ability - peculiar to him - of adapting the
      environment to his needs.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Strictly speaking, active adaptation (by means of
      labor) is found in elementary outline among certain types of so called
      social animals (beavers, who build dams; ants, who erect large hills;
      plant-lice, who exploit certain plants; bees, etc.); the primitive forms
      of human labor were also animal-like, instinctive forms of labor.</FONT></P>

    <H4>c. The Productive Forces; the Productive Forces as <I>an Indicator of
    the Relations between Society and Nature</I></H4>
    
    <P>Thus, the interrelation between society and nature is a process of
      social reproduction. In this process, society applies its human labor
      energy and obtains a certain quantity of energy from nature (&quot;nature's
      material&quot;, in the words of Marx). The <I>balance </I>between
      expenditure and receipts is here obviously the decisive element for the
      growth of society. If what is obtained exceeds the loss by labor,
      important consequences obviously follow for society, which vary with the
      amount of this excess.</P>
    
    <P>Let us suppose a certain society must devote all its working time to
      covering its most rudimentary needs. It is obvious that the products
      obtained will be consumed as rapidly as new products are produced. This
      society will therefore not have enough time to produce an additional
      quantity of products, to extend its requirements, to introduce new
      products; it will hardly be able to make ends meet, will live from hand to
      mouth, will eat up what it produces, consuming just enough to keep on
      working; all its time will be spent in the production of an unvarying
      quantity of products. This society will remain at the same low level of
      existence. It will be impossible for its demands to increase; it will have
      to suit its wants to its resources and both will remain unchanged.</P>
    
    <P>Now let us suppose that for some reason the same quantity of necessary
      products is obtained with an expenditure, not of all of society's time,
      but of only one-half of this time (for example, the primitive tribe has
      migrated to a place where there is twice as much game, twice as many
      beasts of all kinds, or where the earth is twice as fruitful; or, the
      tribe has improved its method of working the soil, or devised new tools,
      etc.).</P>
    
    <P>In such a case, society will be free for one-half of its former working
      time. It may devote this free time to new branches of production: to the
      manufacture of new tools; to the obtaining of new raw materials, etc., and
      also to certain forms of mental labor. Here the growth of new demands
      becomes possible, for the first time we have an opportunity for the birth
      and development o£ so called &quot;mental culture&quot;. If the free
      time now available is used only partly in perfecting the former types of
      labor, it follows that in the future the former demands may be satisfied
      by devoting to them even less than one-half the entire labor time (new
      perfections in the labor process arise); in the next cycle of
      reproduction, still less time is required, etc., and the time thus
      rendered available will be devoted in greater and greater measure to the
      manufacture of more and more improved tools, instruments, machines, on the
      one hand, and, on the other hand, to new branches of production,
      satisfying new wants; and, in the third place, to &quot;mental culture&quot;,
      beginning with those phases that are more or less connected with the
      process of production.</P>
    
    <P>Let us now suppose that the same quantity of necessary objects which
      formerly demanded the expenditure of the entire labor time, now require
      not one-half this time, but twice the time (for instance, owing to an
      exhaustion of the soil); it is clear that unless new modes of labor are
      resorted to, or new lands settled, this society will decline, a portion of
      its numbers will die out. Let us further suppose that a highly developed
      society, with a rich &quot;mental culture&quot;, with the most varied
      wants, an infinite number of different branches of production, with &quot;arts
      and sciences&quot; in full bloom, suddenly finds difficulty in satisfying
      its needs; perhaps, owing to certain reasons, the society is not able to
      manipulate its technical apparatus (for example, there may be constant
      class war, with no class gaining the upper hand, and the productive
      process, with its highly developed technique, dies out); it is then
      necessary to return to an older stage of labor, in which, for covering the
      former demands, a much greater period of time would be required, at
      present an impossibility; production will be curtailed, the standard of
      living will go down, the flourishing &quot;arts and sciences&quot; will
      wither; mental life will be impoverished; society, unless this lowering of
      its standard is the result of merely temporary causes, will be &quot;barbarianized&quot;,
      will go to sleep.</P>
    
    <P>The most noteworthy feature in all these cases is the fact that the
      growth of society is determined by the yield or <i>productivity of
      social labor; </i>the productivity of labor means the relation between
      the quantity of product obtained and the quantity of labor expended; in
      other words, the productivity of labor is the quantity of product per unit
      of working time, for example, the amount of product turned out in one day,
      or in one hour, or in one year. If this amount of product obtained per
      working hour is doubled, we say the productivity of labor has increased
      200 per cent., if it is halved, we say it has gone down 50 per cent.</P>
    
    <P>Obviously, the productivity of labor is a precise measure of the &quot;balance&quot;
      between society and nature; it is a measure of the mutual interaction
      between the environment and the system by which the position of the system
      in the environment is determined, and an alteration of which will indicate
      inevitable changes throughout the internal life of society.</P>
    
    <P>In considering the productivity of social labor, we must also consider
      among labor expenditures the amount of human labor which is devoted to the
      production of suitable instruments of labor. If, for example, a certain
      product has hitherto been manufactured by human hands only, practically
      without tools, and now begins to be made with the aid of complicated
      machinery, and if the application of this machinery makes possible the
      manufacture of twice the quantity of products in the same time as
      formerly, this will not mean that the productivity of labor of the entire
      society will be doubled. For we have not counted the expenditure of human
      labor that went into the manufacture of the machines (or, more correctly,
      we have not counted the labor that <I>is indirectly</I> involved in the
      product because it went <I>directly </I>into the machines). The total
      productivity of labor will therefore be found to have somewhat less than
      doubled.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Those who love to harp on petty things may object to
      the conception of the productivity of social labor, and its adaptation to
      society as a whole, as does P. P. Maslov (<I>Capitalism</I>, in Russian).
      For example, one may raise the objection that the conception of the
      productivity of labor is valid only as applied to single branches of
      production. In a certain year, in so many working hours, so many pairs of
      boots were turned out. In the following year, twice as many in the same
      time. But how may we compare and add together the productivity of labor in
      the fields - let us say - of pig-breeding and orange-culture? Is this not
      as silly as the comparison between music, bills of exchange, and
      sugar-beets, of which Marx spoke so scornfully? Such objections may be
      answered in two ways; in the first place, all the useful products
      appropriated by society may be measured comparatively, as useful energies;
      we already express rye, wheat sugar-beets, and potatoes, in calories; if
      we have not yet advanced so far as to be able to express these other
      things in actual practice, we must not attach too much importance to this
      inability; we must recognize that such a process will ultimately be
      possible; in the second place, we are already able to compare with each
      other, by indirect and complicated methods, quantities of quite varied
      objects. This is not the place for indicating the method pursued, but we
      shall adduce a simple case. If, for example, in a certain year, in a
      certain number of hours of labor, there were produced 1,000 pairs of boots
      plus 2,000 packages of cigarettes plus 20 machines, and in another year,
      in the same labor period: 1,000 pairs of boots plus 1,999 packages of
      cigarettes plus 21 machines plus 100 woolen sweaters, we may maintain
      without error that the productivity of labor has increased on the whole.
      Of course, we can also imagine the objection that not only products of
      consumption are produced, but also instruments of production. This would,
      of course complicate the calculation considerably, but suitable methods
      may be devised for including this circumstance.</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Thus, the relation between nature and society is expressed in the
      relation between the quantity of useful energy turned out<B>. </B>and the
      expenditure of social labor, i.e., the productivity of social labor. The
      expenditure of labor consists of two components: the labor that is
      crystallized and included in the instruments of production, and the &quot;living&quot;
      labor, <I>i.e., </I>the direct expenditure of working energy. If the
      productivity of labor as a quantity be regarded from the point of view of
      the component material factors of this quantity, we find we are dealing
      with three quantities: first, the quantity of products obtained; second,
      the quantity of instruments of production; third, the quantity of the
      productive forces, i.e., living workers. All these quantities are mutually
      dependent. For, if we know what workers are involved, we shall also know
      what they will produce in a given length of time; these two quantities
      determine the third quantity, the product turned out. Taken together,
      these two quantities constitute what we call the <I>material productive
      forces of society. </I>If, in the case of a certain society, we know what
      instruments of production it controls, how many such instruments, what
      kinds of workers and how many, we shall also know what will be the
      productivity of social labor, and what will be the degree to which this
      society has conquered nature, etc. In other 'words, the instruments of
      production and the working forces give us a precise material measure for
      the stage attained in the social evolution.</P>
    
    <P>We may also glance a little deeper; we may go so far as to say that the
      instruments of production determine even the nature of the worker. For
      example, when the linotype machine is added to the system of social labor,
      workers will be found to run the machine. The elements acting in the labor
      process are therefore not merely an aggregation of persons and things, but
      a system in which all things and all persons stand, as it were, at their
      posts, having become adapted to each other. The existence of certain means
      of production implies also the existence of workers to manipulate them.
      Furthermore, the means of production themselves may be distinguished into
      two great groups: raw materials and instruments of labor. Even the
      instrument of labor (tool) performs an active part; with it, the worker
      works the raw material. The existence in a certain society of certain
      tools necessarily implies the existence of the raw material for which
      these tools are intended (of course, in the normal course of
      reproduction). We may therefore definitely state that the system of social
      instruments of labor, i.e., the technology of a certain society, is a
      precise material indicator of the relation between the society and nature.
      The material productive forces of society and the productivity of social
      labor will find their expression in this technical system. &quot;Relics of
      bygone instruments of labor possess the same importance for the
      investigation of extinct economical forms of society (societies of various
      types, <I>N. B</I>.) as do fossil bones for the determination of extinct
      species of animals. It is not the articles made, but how they are made and
      by what instruments, that enables us to distinguish different economic
      epochs.&quot;</P>
    
    <P>The question may also be approached from another angle. The &quot;adaptation&quot;
      of animals to nature consists in an alteration of the various organs of
      these animals: their feet, jaws, fins, etc., which constitutes a passive,
      <I>biological</I> adaptation. But human society adapts itself not
      biologically, but technically, actively, to nature. &quot;An instrument of
      labor is a thing, or a complex of things, which the laborer interposes
      between himself and the subject of his labor, and which serves as the
      conductor of his activity. He makes use of the mechanical, physical, and
      chemical properties of some substances in order to make other substances
      subservient to his aims . . .thus nature becomes one of the organs of his
      activity, one that he annexes to his own bodily organs, adding stature to
      himself in spite of the Bible.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#7" NAME="7b">7)</A></SUP>
      Human society in its technology constitutes an artificial system of organs
      which also are its direct, immediate and active adaptation to nature (it
      may be stated parenthetically that this renders superfluous a direct
      bodily adaptation of man to nature; even as compared with the gorilla, man
      is a weak creature; in his struggle with nature he does not &quot;interpose&quot;
      his jaws, but a system of machines). When viewed from this point of view,
      the question leads us to the same conclusion: the technical system of
      society serves as a precise material indicator of the relation between
      society and nature.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In another passage in <I>Capital, </I>Marx says: &quot;Darwin
      has interested us in the history of Nature's Technology, <I>i.e., </I>in
      the formation of the organs of plants and animals, which organs serve as
      <I>instruments of </I>production for sustaining life. Does not the
      history of the productive organs of man, of organs that are the material
      basis of all social organization deserve equal attention? &quot;
      Technology discloses man's mode of dealing with Nature, the process of
      production by which he sustains his life, and thereby also lays bare the
      mode of formation of his social relations, and of the mental conceptions
      that flow from them&quot; (<I>Capital, </I>vol. i, Chicago, 1915, p.406,
      footnote). &quot;The use and fabrication of instruments of labor, although
      existing in the germ in certain species of animals, is specifically
      characteristic of the human labor-process, and Franklin therefore defines
      man as a tool-making animal&quot; (<I>ibid</I>., vol. i, p. 200). It is
      interesting to observe that the earliest tools were actually constructed &quot;according
      to the image&quot; of the organs of the human body. &quot;Utilizing the
      objects found `at hand' in the immediate environment, the first tools put
      in their appearance as a prolongation, expansion, or reduction of bodily
      organs&quot; (Ernst Kapp: <I>Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik,
      </I>Braunschweig, 1877, p.42). &quot;Blunt tools are anticipated in the
      human fist, while edged tools are anticipated in the finger-nails and the
      incisor teeth. The hammer, with its pene, gives rise to the various forms
      of axe and hatchet; the index finger, held rigid, with its sharp nail, is
      imitated in the borer; a single row of teeth is duplicated in file and
      saw, while the gripping hand and the closing jaw are expressed in the head
      of a pair of tongs and in the jaws of the vise. Hammer, axe, knife,
      chisel, borer, saw, tongs-all are primitive tools&quot; (<I>ibid., pp.
      </I>434q.). &quot;The finger, crooked, becomes a hook; the hollow of the
      hand, a bowl; sword, spear, rudder, shovel, rake, plow, trident, represent
      the various directions and postures of arm, hand and fingers&quot; <I>(ibid.,
      p. </I>45)~ The example of primitive tools also shows how simple
      instruments were developed into more intricate ones: &quot;The staff
      evolves into a number of different forms; it becomes a club for purposes
      of vigorous aggression; a pointed stick for turning over the ground; a
      spear for palings and for throwing at game&quot; (Friedrich von
      Gottl-Ottlilienfeld: <I>Wirtschaft and Technik </I>in <I>Grundriss der
      Nationalokonomie</I>, vol. ii, p. 228).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The close connection between technology and the so
      called &quot;cultural wealth&quot; is obvious. We need only to compare
      present-day China and Japan. In China-by virtue of a number of
      circumstances - the productivity of social labor, and the social
      technology, developed very slowly, and China may therefore be considered,
      for the moment, a stagnant civilization. The new capitalist technology
      will here exert a revolutionizing influence. In Japan, on the other hand,
      great advances in technical evolution have been made in recent decades,
      and Japan's culture  has correspondingly developed rapidly; a glance at
      the state of Japanese science will show this.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the early Middle Ages, culturally at a lower level
      than so called antiquity, &quot;technology made a great retrogression as
      compared with antiquity, and many methods and mechanical inventions of the
      ancient world were forgotten &quot; The sole exception was the technique
      of warfare and the metallurgy of iron connected with that technique&quot;
      (W. K. Agafonov: <I>Modern Technology, </I>in Russian, vol. iii, p.16 .
      Obviously, no cultural accumulation was possible on this technical
      foundation: society's living sap was too poor to make a &quot;full life&quot;
      possible. The swift growth of Europe coincides with the capitalist machine
      technology; the century 1750-1850 witnessed a revolution in technology;
      steam-engine, steam transportation, coal, machine methods in obtaining
      iron etc. There followed the application of electricity, turbine engines,
      Diesel motors, the automobile, aviation. The technical basis of society,
      and its productive forces, rose to unprecedented heights. Under these
      circumstances, of course, human society was capable of developing a very
      intricate and versatile &quot;mental life&quot;. If we examine the ancient
      civilizations, with their comparatively intricate mental life, the
      backwardness of even <I>their </I>technology as compared with the
      capitalist technology of modern Europe and America is very striking. More
      or less complicated machines were used chiefly for construction work,
      water supply systems, and mining. Even the greatest establishments came
      into being not by reason of their perfect instruments, but owing to their
      use of an immense number of living labor forces. &quot;Herodotus reports
      that 100,000 men carried stones for three months for the pyramid of Cheops
      (2800 B.C.), and ten years had to be spent in the preliminary work of
      making a road leading from the quarries down to the Nile&quot; (Agafonov:
      <I>ibid</I>., p.5). The comparative poverty of ancient technology is
      apparent from the definition of a &quot;machine&quot;, given by the
      ancient Roman engineer Vitruvius &quot;A machine is an articulated
      connection of wood, affording great advantages in lifting weights&quot; (<I>ibid</I>.,
      p.3). These wooden &quot;machines&quot; were used chiefly for &quot;raising

    <H4>d. The Equilibrium Between Nature and Society; Its Disturbances and
    Readjustments</H4>
    
    <P>Considered as a whole, we find that the process of reproduction is a
      process of constant disturbance and reestablishment of equilibrium between
      society and nature.</P>
    
    <P>Marx distinguishes between <I>simple </I>reproduction and reproduction
      <I>on an extending scale.</I></P>
    
    <P>Let us first consider the case of simple reproduction. We have seen that
      in the process of production, the means of production are used up (the raw
      material is worked over, various auxiliary substances are required, such
      as lubricating oil, rags, etc.; the machines themselves, and the buildings
      in which the work is done, as well as all kinds of instruments and their
      parts, wear out); on the other hand, labor power is also exhausted (when
      people work, they also deteriorate, their labor power is used up, and a
      certain expenditure must be incurred in order to reestablish this labor
      power). In order that the process of production may continue, it is
      necessary to reproduce in it and by means of it the substances that it
      consumes. For example, in textile production, cotton is consumed as a raw
      material, while the weaving machinery deteriorates. In order that
      production may continue, cotton must continue to be raised somewhere, and
      looms to be manufactured. At one point the cotton disappears by reason of
      its transformation into fabrics, at another point, fabrics disappear
      (workers, etc., use them) and cotton reappears. At one point, looms are
      being slowly wiped out, while at another they are being produced. In other
      words, the necessary elements of production required in one place must be
      produced somewhere else; there must be a constant replacement of
      everything needed in production; if This replacement proceeds smoothly and
      at the same rate as the disappearance, we have a case of simple
      reproduction, which corresponds to a situation in which the productive
      social labor remains uniform, with the productive forces unchanging, and
      society moving neither forward nor backward. It is clear that this is a
      case of stable equilibrium between society and nature. It involves
      constant disturbances of equilibrium (disappearance of products in
      consumption and deterioration) and a constant reestablishment of
      equilibrium (the products reappear); but this reestablishment is always on
      the old basis: just as much is produced as has been consumed; and again
      just as much is consumed as has been produced, etc., etc. The process of
      reproduction is here a dance to the same old tune.</P>
    
    <P>But where the productive forces are increasing, the case is different.
      Here, as we have seen, a portion of the social labor is liberated and
      devoted to an extension of social production (new production branches;
      extension of old branches). This involves not only a replacement of the
      formerly existing elements of production, but also the insertion of new
      elements into the new cycle of production. Production here does not
      continue on the same path, moving in the same cycle all the time, but
      increases in scope. This is <I>production on an extending scale, </I>in
      which case equilibrium is always established on a new basis;
      simultaneously with a certain consumption proceeds a larger production;
      consumption consequently also increases, while production increases still
      further. Equilibrium results in each case in a wider basis; we are now
      dealing with <I>unstable equilibrium with positive indication</I>.</P>
    
    <P>The third case, finally, is that of a decline in the productive forces.
      In this case, the process of reproduction falls asleep: smaller and
      smaller quantities are reproduced. A certain quantity is consumed, but
      reproduction involves a smaller quantity still; less is consumed; and
      still less is reproduced, etc. Here again, reproduction does not repeat
      the same old cycle in each case; its sphere grows narrower and narrower;
      society's condition of life becomes poorer and poorer. The equilibrium
      between society and nature is reestablished on a level that goes lower and
      lower each time.</P>
    
    <P>Society meanwhile is adapting itself to this continually narrowing
      standard of living, which can only be done by the partial disintegration
      of society. We are here dealing with <I>unstable equilibrium with
      negative indication. </I>The reproduction in this case may be termed <I>negatively
      </I>extended reproduction, or extended <I>insufficiency of production.</I></P>
    
    <P>Having discussed the subject from all angles, we have found the same
      result always, each case depending on the character of the equilibrium
      between society and nature. Since the productive forces serve as a precise
      expression of this equilibrium, these forces enable us to judge its
      character. Our remarks would apply just as well if we were speaking of the
      <I>technology </I>of society.</P>

    <H4>e. The Productive Forces as the Point of Departure in Sociological
    Analysis</H4>
    
    <P>From all that has been said above, the following scientific law results
      inevitably: any investigation of society, of the conditions of its growth,
      its forms, its content, etc., must begin with an analysis of the
      productive forces, or of the technical bases, of society. Let us first
      take up a few of the objections that are made - or might be made - against
      this view.</P>
    
    <P>In the first place, let us consider some objections advanced by scholars
      who in general accept the materialist point of view. One of these,
      Heinrich Cunow, says <SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#8" NAME="8b">8)</A></SUP>
      that technology &quot;is related to a very great extent with the
      conditions of nature. The presence of certain raw materials <I>(das
      Vorkommen bestimmter Rohmaterialien) </I>determines, for example, whether
      it is possible for certain forms of technology to develop at all, as well
      as the direction which they will take. For instance, where certain species
      of stone, or woods, or ores, or fibers, or shell-fish, are not present,
      the natives of these regions will of course never be able to develop of
      themselves these natural substances, or make tools and weapons from them.&quot;
      At the beginning of this chapter we have already adduced data as to the
      influence of the natural conditions. Why should we not begin with these
      conditions in nature? Why should the starting point of our methodology not
      be nature itself? There is no doubt that its influence on technology is as
      great as Cunow says, and, in addition, nature of course existed before
      society. Are we not therefore sinning against true materialism when we
      base it on an analysis of the material technical apparatus of human
      society?</P>
    
    <P>However close a examination of the question will show how erroneous are
      Cunow's conclusions. To be sure, where there are no deposits of coal, no
      coal can be dug from the ground. But, we might also add, you can't dig it
      out with your fingers either; and it will be somewhat hard to make use of
      it if you don't know its useful qualities. &quot;Raw materials&quot;, in
      fact, do not &quot;exist&quot; in nature as Cunow says. &quot;Raw
      materials&quot; according to Marx are products of labor, and they have as
      little existence in the bowels of nature as has a painting by Raphael or
      Herr Cunow's waistcoat (Cunow is here confusing &quot;raw materials&quot;

      Cunow completely forgets that a certain stage of technology must have been
      reached before wood, or, fibers, etc., may play the part of raw materials.
      Coal becomes a raw material only when technology has developed so far as
      to delve in the bowels of the earth and drag their contents into the light
      of day. The influence of nature, in the sense of providing materials,
      etc., is itself a product of the development of technology; before
      technology had conquered coal, coal had no &quot;influence&quot; at all.
      Before technology with its feelers had reached the iron-ore, this iron-ore
      was permitted to sleep its eternal slumber; its influence on man was zero.</P>
    
    <P>Human society works in nature and on nature, as the subject of its
      labor. But the elements existing as such in nature are here more or less
      constant and therefore <I>cannot explain changes. </I>It is the social
      technology which changes, which adapts itself to that which exists in
      nature (there is no possibility of adapting oneself to empty space; it .is
      the cannon, and not the hole, that is manufactured). Technology is a
      varying quantity, and precisely its variations produce the changes in the
      relations between society and nature; technology therefore must constitute
      a point of departure in an analysis of social changes.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#10" NAME="10b">10)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">L. Mechnikov expresses this idea very stupidly: &quot;Far
      be it from me to give support to the theory' of geographical fatalism,
      which is often opposed as a propagating principle of the all-determining
      influence of the environment in history. In my opinion . . . the changes
      must be sought not in the environment itself, but in the mutual relations
      arising between the environment and the natural capacities of its
      inhabitants for cooperation and <I>team work </I>of a social order (my
      italics, N. B.). It follows that the historical value of one geographical
      environment or another-even assuming that it remain physically unchanged
      under all circumstances - can and must vary with the degree of capacity of
      its inhabitants for voluntary <I>team work&quot; </I>(Mechnikov, <I>ibid</I>.,
      pp.27, 28). All of which does not prevent Mechnikov himself from
      overestimating &quot;geography&quot;. (<I>Cf. </I>Plekhanov's
      criticism in the collection <I>Criticism of Our Critics</I>.) The passive
      character of the influence of nature is now recognized by almost all
      geographers, although bourgeois scholars of this type of course know
      nothing of historical materialism. Thus, John McFarlane <I>(Economic
      Geography, </I>London) writes concerning the &quot;natural conditions of
      economic activity&quot; (chap. i): &quot;These physical factors &quot; do
      <I>not determine the economic life absolutely, </I>but they do have an
      influence upon it, which is unquestionably more noticeable in the earlier
      stage of human history, but which is just as real in the advanced
      civilizations, after man has learned to adapt himself to his environment
      and to draw, more and more, an increased benefit from it.&quot; The role
      played by coal, and the dependence of our industry upon it, are well
      known. As the technique of winning and working peat changes, the
      significance of coal may decrease, and this would involve an immense
      dislocation of the industrial centers. The progress of electrification
      assigned a more important role to aluminium, formerly of subsidiary
      importance. Water as a form of power was once of great importance (the
      millwheel, then declining, and now again rising; turbines, &quot;white
      coal&quot;). Space relations in nature remain the same; but distances are
      decreased for men by the use of transportation devices; the development of
      aviation is changing the picture still more.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is therefore obvious that the differences in the
      natural conditions will explain the different evolution of the different
      nations, but not the course followed by the evolution of one and the same
      society. The natural differences, when these nations combine into a
      society, later become a basis for the social division of labor. &quot;It
      is not the absolute fruitfulness of the soil, but its differentiation, the
      manifoldness of its natural products, which constitutes the basis of the
      social division of labor, and which spurs man on, to the multiplication of
      his own needs, abilities, instruments and modes of labor, owing to changes
      in the natural circumstances in which he dwells&quot; (Marx, <I>Capital</I>,
      vol. i).</FONT></P>
    
    <P>Another group of objections to the conception of social development that
      we have advanced above is based on the decisive and fundamental importance
      of the growth of population. For the tendency to multiplication is
      ineradicably present in human nature, where it has existed since before
      the beginnings of history. This tendency is of animal, biological nature;
      it is older than human society. Does not this process stand at the
      beginning of the entire evolution? Does not the increasing fruitfulness
      and density of the population determine the course of social evolution?</P>
    
    <P>Actually, this would be reasoning backward along a law of nature, for it
      is on the stage of development of the productive forces, or, what amounts
      to the same thing, on the stage of technical development, that the very
      possibility of a numerical growth of population depends. A more or less
      continuous increase in population is nothing more nor less than an
      extension and growth of the social system, which is possible only when the
      relation between society and nature has been altered in a favorable
      direction. It is not possible for a greater number of persons to live
      unless the bases of life are widened. On the other hand, an impoverishment
      of these bases of life will inevitably express itself in a smaller
      population. The question of how this happens is another matter whether it
      is by a lowering of the birth rate, or by its artificial regulation, or by
      a process of dying out, by an increase in the mortality from diseases, by
      a premature exhaustion of the organisms and a decrease in the average
      length of life; the fact remains that this fundamental relation between
      the bases of the life of society and the quantity of its population will
      express itself in one way or another.</P>
    
    <P>Besides, it is entirely erroneous to represent the growth of population
      as a purely biological (&quot;natural&quot;) process of multiplication.
      This process depends on any number of social conditions: on the division
      into classes, the position of these classes, and consequently, on the
      forms of the social economy. Now, the forms of society, its structure, as
      we shall show below, depend on the level reached in the evolution of its
      productive forces. It is quite clear that the relation between the growth
      of technology and the movement of population, <I>i.e., </I>alterations in
      its number, are not at all simple. Only naive persons could imagine that
      the process of multiplication proceeds as primitively and simply among
      human beings as among animals. For example, for an increase of population,
      in society, it is always necessary that the productive forces should be
      increased, otherwise, as we have already shown, the excess population will
      have nothing to eat. And, on the other hand, an increase in material
      well-being does not always and in all classes produce a more rapid
      multiplication: while the proletarian family may be artificially limiting
      the number of its children because of the hard conditions of life, a
      society lady may be renouncing motherhood in order not to spoil her
      figure, while a French peasant wishes to have no more than two children
      because he does not want his farms to be divided up. The movement of
      population is therefore a result of a number of social conditions, and is 
      dependent on the form of society and on the situation of the various
      classes and groups within society.</P>
    
    <P>We may therefore make the following statement with regard to population;
      an increase in the population indisputably presupposes an increase in the
      productive forces of society; in the second place, each epoch, each form
      of society, the varying situations of the various classes, result in
      special laws for the movement of population. &quot;An abstract law of
      population exists for plants and animals only, and only in so far as man
      has not interfered with them&quot;; &quot; &quot;every special historic
      mode of production has its own special laws of population, historically
      valid within its limits alone&quot;.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#11" NAME="11b">11)</A></SUP>
      But the historic mode of production, <I>i.e., </I>the form of society, is
      determined by the development of the productive forces, <I>i.e., </I>the
      development of technology. We thus see that the absence of natural law in
      the movement of population is a decisive factor, while the growth of the
      productive forces, and the uniformity of this growth (or decline), of
      themselves determine the movement of population.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The bourgeoisie has repeatedly attempted to replace the
      social laws by means of &quot;laws&quot; showing the necessity of the
      divinely ordained poverty of the masses, and that this condition is
      independent of the social order. It is to this effort that we must trace
      the overestimating of &quot;geography&quot;, etc., in the doctrine of
      environment, natural phenomena being dragged in by the ears in order to
      explain historical events. Thus, Ernst Miller &quot;proved&quot; the
      dependence of historical evolution on terrestrial magnetism; Jevons &quot;explained&quot;
      industrial crises by means of sun-spots, etc. Here belongs also the famous
      attempt of the English clergyman economist, Robert Malthus, to explain the
      discomforts of the working class on the basis of man's sinful desire for
      multiplication. Malthus' &quot;abstract law of population&quot; is
      formulated in the thesis that population grows more rapidly than the means
      of subsistence; the latter increase in arithmetical progression while the
      population increases in geometrical progression. Among modern scientists,
      the conceptions of bourgeois scholars are undergoing radical changes, and
      Malthus' theory is now in disfavor; this is due to the fact that (first in
      France, then in other countries also) the increase in population is so
      slow that the bourgeoisie fears a lack of able-bodied soldiers
      (cannon-fodder), and therefore attempts to encourage the working class to
      produce more children.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The Physiocrats were already aware of the dependence of
      population increases on the stage reached by the productive forces. Le
      Mercier de la Rivière (<I>L'ordre naturel et essentiel des sociétés
      politiques</I>, 1767, pp.5, 6) says: &quot;If men should nourish
      themselves with products furnished by the earth itself . . . without any
      preliminary labor, an immense extent of area would be required for the
      subsistence of even a small number of persons; but we know from experience
      that by reason of our natural constitution (<I>l'ordre physique de notre
      constitution</I>) we tend to multiply considerably. This natural property
      would be a contradiction, a discord in nature . . . if <I>the natural
      order of reproduction of the means of subsistence did not permit them to
      multiply to the same extent as we do:&quot; </I>(My italics, N. B.)
      Further on, we read: &quot;I am not at all afraid of the arguments that
      will be brought to bear against me, based on certain American tribes, in
      order to prove that the natural order of births makes cultivation
      unnecessary. I know there are some tribes that have practically no
      cultivation (<I>ne cultivent point ou presque point</I>) of the soil;
      yet, though soil and climate are equally favorable to them, they destroy
      their children, kill their old, and make use of medicaments to prevent the
      natural course of birth.&quot; Ernst Grosse <I>(Formen der Familie and
      Formen der Wirtschaft</I>, 1896, p.36) says among other things: &quot;The
      Bushmen and the Australians are accustomed, for a good cause, to wear
      `hunger-belts'. The Patagonians suffer need practically always. And in the
      tales of the Eskimos, famine plays &quot; a great role &quot;. A
      population limited to such imperfect production can of course never become
      very numerous &quot;. Therefore, primitive hunters usually see to it
      themselves that their numbers shall not exceed what can be fed with the
      available foodstuffs. Infanticide with this purpose is very common in
      Australia. A large child mortality takes care of the rest&quot; - &quot;We
      even hear, of tribes in the Polynesian Islands, that they have regulations
      permitting only a minimum of children to each family, a fine being imposed
      for violations.&quot; (P. Mombert: <I>Bevölkerungslelare </I>in <I>Grundriss
      der Sozialökonomie, </I>part ii, Tiibingen, 1914, p.62.) . Mombert
      mentions the following facts after describing the economic advance in the
      Carolingian Era (transition to the three-field system, etc.): &quot;As a
      consequence of this great expansion in the production of foodstuffs, we
      meet with an exceptionally large increase of population in Germany&quot;
      (p.64.). In the Nineteenth Century, Europe presents an immense advance in
      the field of agricultural production, &quot;accompanied by a great
      increase in the European population, far exceeding any such increase in
      the past&quot; (p.64). There ensues a period in which the increase in
      population, due to the above cause, moves faster than the increase in the
      means of subsistence. The result <I>is: </I>emigration to America. The
      same law may be observed in Russia (cf. the studies of M. N. Pokrovsky).</FONT></P>
    
    <P>We must finally point out a number of other objections to the theory of
      historical materialism, namely, those theories that are known as &quot;racial
      theories&quot;. These theories may be described as follows: society
      consists of men; these men do not appear always the same in history, but
      different; they have different skulls, different brains, different skin
      and hair, different physical structure, and consequently, different
      abilities. It is clear that at the banquet of history there will be many
      called but few chosen. Some races have shown themselves to be &quot;historical&quot;,
      for the names of these races re-echo over the world, and the professors of
      all the universities concern themselves with them; other races, the &quot;lower
      races&quot;, are by nature capable of nothing; they cannot produce
      anything of note; at bottom, they constitute a historical nonentity; these
      races are not worthy of the name &quot;historical races&quot;. They may
      serve at best as a fertilizer for history, as the peoples of colonies, as
      &quot;savages&quot; of various kinds, tilling the soil for European
      bourgeois civilization. It is this difference of race that is the true
      reason for the differing evolution of society. Race must be the point of
      departure in the discussion of evolution. Such, in broad outline, is the
      <I>race theory. </I>On the subject of this theory, G. V. Plekhanov made
      the following perfectly correct observation: &quot;In considering the
      question of the cause of a certain historical phenomenon, sensible and
      serious people often content themselves with solutions which solve nothing
      at all, being merely a repetition of the question in other forms of
      expression. Suppose you put one of the above mentioned questions to a
      `scholar'; ask him why certain races develop with such remarkable
      slowness, while others advance rapidly on the path of civilization. Your
      `scholar' will not hesitate to reply that this phenomenon is to be
      explained by racial qualities. Can you see any sense in such an answer?
      Certain races develop slowly because it is a racial quality with them to
      develop slowly; others become civilized very rapidly, because their
      principal racial characteristic is the ability to become civilized very
      rapidly.&quot;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#12" NAME="12b">12)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P>In the first place, the race theory is in contradiction with the facts.
      The &quot;lowest&quot; race, that which is said to be incapable, by
      nature, of any development, is the black race, the Negroes. Yet it has
      been shown that the ancient representatives of this black race, the so
      called Kushites, created a very high civilization in India (before the
      days of the Hindoos) and Egypt; the yellow race, which now also enjoys but
      slight favor, also created a high civilization in China, far superior in
      its day to the then existing civilizations of white men; the white men
      were then children as compared with the yellow men. We now know how much
      the ancient Greeks borrowed from the Assyro-Babylonians and the Egyptians.
      These few facts are sufficient to show that the &quot;racial&quot;
      explanation is no explanation at all. It may be replied: perhaps you were
      right, but will you go so far as to say that the average Negro stands at
      the same level, in his abilities, as the average European? There is no
      sense in answering such a question with benevolent subterfuges, as certain
      liberal professors sometimes do, to the effect that all men are of course
      equal, that according to Kant, the human personality is in itself a final
      consideration, or that Christ taught that there are no Hellenes, or Jews,
      etc.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#13" NAME="13b">13)</A></SUP> To aspire
      to equality between races is one thing; to admit the similarity of their
      qualities is another. We aspire to that which does not exist; otherwise we
      are attempting to force doors that are already open. We are now not
      concerned with the question: what must be our aim? We are considering the
      question of whether there is a difference between the level, cultural and
      otherwise, of white men and black men, on the whole. There is such a
      difference; the &quot;white&quot; men are at present on a higher level,
      but this only goes to show that at present these so called races have
      changed places.</P>
    
    <P>This is a complete refutation of the theory of race. At, bottom, this
      theory always reduces itself to the peculiarities of races, to their
      immemorial &quot;character&quot;. If such were the case, this &quot;character&quot;
      would have expressed itself in the same way in all the periods of history.
      The obvious inference is that the &quot;nature&quot; of the races is
      constantly changing with the conditions of their existence. But these
      conditions are determined by nothing more nor less than the relation
      between society and nature, <I>i.e</I>, the condition of the productive
      forces. In other words, the theory of race does not in the slightest
      manner explain the conditions of social evolution. Here also it is evident
      that the analysis must begin with the movement of the productive forces.</P>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">There is great disagreement among scholars concerning
      race and race subdivisions. Topinard (quoted by Mechnikov, <I>ibid</I>.,
      p. 54) correctly remarks that the designation &quot;race&quot; is
      being used for quite subsidiary purposes, far instance, we hear of an
      Indo-Germanic, Latin, Teutonic, Slavic, English, race, although all these
      designations mark accidental aggregates of the most varied anthropological
      elements. In Asia, the races were mixed so often and so thoroughly that
      the race which is characteristic of original Asiatic conditions is perhaps
      to be sought beyond the Pacific Ocean or at the Arctic Circle. In Africa,
      the same process was frequently repeated. In America, where a similar
      condition may be observed in historical times, we find no primitive races,
      but only the results of endless mixtures and cross-breedings. Eduard Meyer
      very convincingly observes: &quot;As for the question of race, it is of
      course possible that the human race appeared at its origin in a number of
      varieties, or was subdivided into such at an early epoch; I am incompetent
      to judge of this. But it is absolutely certain that all the human races
      are constantly mingling &quot; that a sharp line may not be drawn between
      them - the tribes of the Nile Valley are a typical example - and that so
      called pure racial types may be found only in places where certain tribes
      have been kept in a condition of artificial isolation owing to external
      circumstances, as, for example, on the islands of Borneo and Australia.
      But there is no justification for the assumption that we are dealing with
      primitive natural conditions of the human race even here; it seems far
      more probable that this homogeneity, on the contrary, is the result of
      isolation&quot; (<I>ibid</I>., pp.74., 75). Professor R. Michels
      <I>(Wirtschaft und Rasse, </I>in <I>Grundriss der Sozialökoromie,
      </I>part ii, p.98 <I>et seq.), </I>gives a number of interesting
      examples, excellently showing the mutability of so called race traits, in
      the field of labor. For example: the power of resistance of Chinese
      workers is very high, enabling them to bear heavy burdens; thence the
      widespread use of Chinese coolies. But it is quite clear that the &quot;burdens&quot;
      imposed upon the coolies are a result, in part, of a semi-colonial
      enslavement. Negroes are considered poor workers, but a French proverb
      says: &quot;I have worked like a negro&quot; (<I>j'ai travaillé
      comme un nègre</I>). Negroes rarely became employers,
      perhaps because they were boycotted by the whites, etc. The examples in
      the domain of national differences are even more interesting: &quot;When
      the first railroads were built in Germany, a German uttered the warning
      that railroads were of no value in view of the German national character,
      which - thank God! - was expressed in the splendid principle of <I>festina
      lente </I>(&quot;make haste slowly&quot;); railroads could be of use
      perhaps to a different race, a different mode of life, a different mode of
      thought. Kant rebuked the Italians for their practical-mindedness, for
      their highly developed banking system; yet today we know that other
      regions take precedence of Italy in this respect,&quot; etc. Michels draws
      the absolutely correct conclusion &quot;that the degree of economic
      utility of any people is about equivalent to the degree of technical and
      moral-intellectual `civilization' attained by it at the given moment&quot;
      (p.101).</FONT></P>
