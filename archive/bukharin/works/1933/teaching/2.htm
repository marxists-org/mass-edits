<H3>2. The Theory of Historical Materialism</H3>

<P>The laws of materialist dialectic are all-embracing, general laws of becoming. As we have seen, 
a deep and all-embracing historicism is at their basis, that is to say, a historicism which can 
embrace all
forms of movement. This Marxist dialectical method is much wider and more universal than the 
idealist dialectic of Hegel, the limitation of which does not merely lie in exalting a limited sphere of
consciousness. into the substance of the universal. The limitation of the Hegelian dialectic 
also lies in its two most important qualities. Firstly, with Hegel nature has no history.<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup> 
Secondly, history
itself settles down with the bourgeois landlord state (here Hegel's system in fact conflicts 
with his method). Both these limitations, which are of quite exceptional importance, are 
undoubtedly
connected with the idealist character of Hegelian dialectic. Hence, by the way, the 
unsurpassably wretched poverty of those &quot;thinkers&quot; (&quot;manufacturers of ideology&quot;, as Marx 
called them), who
suggest that the difference between the Marxian and Hegelian dialectic is simply a matter of a change of label and that in fact Marx remained a Hegelian to the end of his life.<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2)</a></sup> Whereas 
Marxian
dialectic as a doctrine of historical development was the first to conquer the whole sphere of
nature comprehended from the point of view of an historical process, and broke those fetters 
which Hegel
put upon the understanding of social development. This remarkable expansion of outlook proceeds 
entirely from Marx, a thing which bourgeois investigators cannot understand. Even very recently
this sort of gap between nature and society played, and still plays to this day, a very 
important part. The whole conception of the Rickert school proceeds from the historical character of society and the unhistorical character of nature. The whole laborious 
differentiation between the generalising method of the natural sciences and the individualising 
method of the
social sciences, between nomothetics (or nomology), on the one hand, and ideography on the 
other, between &quot;natural laws&quot; and &quot;reference to worth&quot; is founded in the last resort on the 
absolute
rupture between society and nature. This is, in essence, a softened and refined theology, 
converting human society into a super-natural quantity. Whereas society and nature are a unity, 
but a
contradictory unity. Society itself is a product of the,historical development of nature, but 
a product which relatively is in opposition to nature, reacts upon it and even in the process 
of historical
development transforms external nature itself into its product (the so-called cultivated 
landscape). Therefore Marx said that in fact there is one science, the science of history, 
which embraces both
the history of the inorganic world, and the history of the organic world and the history of 
society.<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">3)</a></sup> In the sphere of the natural sciences this meant a decisive break with 
mechanistic-mathematical
rationalism which in Marx is bound up with the criticism of mechanistic materialism.</P>

<P>Natural matter was conceived as being all of the same kind, as only a quantitatively defined 
quantity, as a combination of qualitatively similar parts. Diversity of quality was from this 
point of view
merely an illusion of a subjective character.</P>

<P class="quote">Matter as such is a pure creation of thought and an abstraction. In bringing under the 
conception of matter the things examined by us as bodily existing we are distracted from the 
qualitative
differences in them. Therefore matter as such, in distinction from <I>definitely existing matters</I> (our emphasis, N.B.), is not something existing sensually... It (this point of view, the &quot;onesided mathematical point of view&quot;, N.B.) is even a return to Pythagoras who already regarded number, 
quantitative definition as the essence of things.<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">4)</a></sup></P>

<P>In other words qualityless matter would bring us back to the position of so-called logical 
realism, in opposition to nominalism. It does not, hôwever, in any way follow from this that &quot;matter has
disappeared&quot;. It only follows that, objectively and independently of our consciousness, it 
exists in all the wealth of
its qualitatively different and varied forms, with an historical process of transition from one 
form to another, with specific forms of movement and, consequently, with specific laws for this 
movement.
Even in the limits of inorganic nature mechanical movement and chemical movement are distinct, although they pass into one another. The organic world grows out of the inorganic in the 
process of
historical development, but, once it has arisen, it develops its specific forms of movement. 
Society arises historically from the biological species, through the herd, but once it has 
arisen, it develops
in turn through its conditioned laws. It passes through different stages of development. It is
always historical, that is it exists really only in its historical form, with its own 
historically defined laws,
etc. In this way we here have all the wealth and all the variety of the world which in the 
historical process of thought, on the basis of the historical process of the development of 
social practice, is
ever more adequately &quot;grasped&quot; by this thought. Every new form of moving matter thus has its 
own special laws. But this enriched form and these new laws are not cut off by a Chinese wall 
from
those historically preceding them. The latter exist in these in &quot;sublated form&quot;. Herein lies 
the historical succession of processes. On the other hand, variety does not exclude unity. So 
it is no
question of a flat monism of knowledge for which variety has no meaning and to which all cats 
are grey, nor is it a matter of pluralism for which unity does not exist, but of dialectical 
and materialist
monism, which is adequate to the real unity in variety and variety in unity, with all its forms 
of contradiction, with its ruptures and catastrophes, with its transition of one form into 
another, which is
adequate to the mighty and general historical process of development.</P>

<P>The historical view of society therefore presupposed the breaking down of the 
mathematical-atomistic-individualist conception of rationalism. However, here the essence of 
the matter did not lie at all
in the fact (as the Kantians argue)<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">5)</a></sup> that society must be torn out of (absolutely) its 
natural historical environment and converted into a substance creating the world out of its 
spiritual depths and
dictating its laws to the cosmos, but in the ascertaining 
of specific social laws on the basis of an historical view of nature itself. The great 
limitation of the natural scientific theories before Marx lies in the &quot;eternity&quot; of the laws 
of nature, i.e. in the
supposition that the connections between things and processes are constant. This presupposed 
the constancy and unchangingness of things. Whereas &quot;the eternal laws of nature are more and
more becoming transformed into historical laws. That water is liquid from o° to 100° is an 
eternal law of nature, but in order that it may have any force there must be: (1) Water, (2) a given temperature
and (3) a normal pressure... All our official physics, chemistry, and biology are 
exclusively geocentric, and calculated for the earth...&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">6)</a></sup> So here there is no difference 
in principle between society
and nature. The Kantians and idealists generally have to make use of a sophism. They wish, 
starting from a correct notion of the originality of social development, to draw the conclusion 
that this
originality is principally in the sense of the supernatural character of society. Just as &quot;spirit&quot; is in no way an efflorescence of matter but the real substance of matter, so human 
society is a special
quantity insofar as it is not relatively but absolutely opposed to nature. So the laws of 
social development, if they exist at all, are supernatural laws having nothing in common with 
the laws of nature.
Their specific character here in fact becomes a supernatural character which serves in its turn 
as a bridge to God.</P>

<P>So it is obvious how Marx's peculiar terminology is explained. Marx frequently, beginning with the first volume of <I>Capital</I>, speaks of the social process as a &quot;natural historical&quot; process, 
of the laws of
social movement as &quot; natural laws like the law of gravity &quot;, etc. On the other hand, Marx 
energetically emphasises the specific nature of social relationships and the corresponding laws 
(&quot;Nature does
not create the owners of money on the one hand and the owners of nothing but their own labour 
power on the other. This relation is anything but natural-historical&quot; (<I>ibid.</I>)). But only 
stupid minds
can deduce from this an &quot;inconsistency&quot; in Marx. For it is clear where his main approach 
lies. Society is the link in the chain of the general historical development of the world, a 
link which develops
according to
law like the development of nature (in this sense the laws of society are natural-historical 
laws however &quot;critically thinking persons&quot; might wish to jump out into a world of 
supernatural being). But
this law is a special law. It is not a law of either physical, chemical or biological type. It is a specifically social law which must be &quot;theoretically grasped&quot; in precisely this specific 
character. In the one
case (against the idealists) Marx emphasises the connection with nature. In the other (against mechanistic materialism, the &quot;organology&quot; of the biological school of sociologists and 
positivists of
Comte and Spencer and their epigones) he. emphasises the specifically social character, the new 
quality. Even a very slightly thoughtful attitude towards the subject makes the full wealth of the
Marxian method absolutely clear in comparison with all other schools and tendencies. The 
overcoming of the &quot;naturalist&quot; point of view (which does not start from the unity of society 
and nature,
together with their opposition, but from their identity) is far from implying an obligatory 
(which the bourgeois ideologists reach) transition to the standpoint of idealist metaphysics. 
The idea of
historicism is far from being the private property of the idealist tendencies in thought. 
Historical &quot;laws of movement&quot; of society can in fact be discovered only by means of 
materialist dialectic.</P>

<P>So the laws of social development are specific laws. It is therefore, for example, 
fundamentally incorrect and methodologically impermissible to transfer mechanically laws of a 
biological order into
processes of social development. Society has developed historically out of the animal herd but it is itself no longer a herd. The &quot;way of life&quot; of an animal species, that is the uniformity 
of vital
behaviour of animals of one species, is still not a &quot;mode of production&quot;. The natural organs
of an animal differ fundamentally from artificial technique which is itself the product of 
active labour, that
is of active adaptation to environment. And so on and so on.<sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">7)</a></sup> The transition from the herd to productive society is, from the point of view of world history, a leap, although this in its 
turn was a
whole immense and lengthy historical period. But, insofar as society has already formed as a 
new link in the general and universal historical process, it develops its special
contradictions and discloses a special form of movement. &quot;It was necessary in this case,
therefore, just as in the realm of nature, to set aside these artificial inter-relations by the
discovery of the real, a task which finally culminated in the discovery of the universal laws of
movement which established themselves as the dominating ones in the history of human
society.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">8)</a></sup> These &quot;universal laws of movement which established themselves as the
dominating ones in the history of human society&quot; were formulated by Marx in his theory of
historical materialism, a doctrine of genius the creation of which certainly marks a new epoch
in the development of the social sciences. So the general laws of dialectic here found a
special, concrete, social form of manifestation. Society was included as a link in the universal
chain of history, in full correspondence with objective historical reality.
But it is just in this that the superiority of the bold, fearless, revolutionary and materialist
dialectic of Marx showed itself with striking power. We must once again emphasise with all
force the originality of Marxist historicism in comparison with the historicism of the &quot;historical school&quot; in all its various manifestations. It is well known how viciously Marx 
flayed
it.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">9)</a></sup> In practice taking its direction from the eternalising of the datum, in theory it simply
included any &quot;interruption in gradualness,&quot; whereas Marx's revolutionary dialectic starts
from the inevitable change of social forms, including an historically conditioned
contradictoriness of development, the sharpening of inner contradictions, the class struggle,
the catastrophic transition of one social form into another by means of revolution, etc.</P>

<P>The strict knowledge of the objective laws of social development is a long way from
presupposing in Marx, despite the numerous critics who wage a permanent guerilla warfare of
dwarfs against the giant of thought and action, any kind of &quot;destiny&quot; or &quot; fate&quot;. With Marx
history itself is a long way from hypostasising and is not transformed into a peculiar subject
standing above human beings. On the contrary, as long ago as the time of his controversy
with Bruno Bauer Marx demolished such a treatment of the problem. &quot;History&quot;, he wrote in
the <I>Holy Family</I>, &quot;is not some kind of special personality which man makes 
use of to attain his ends. History is simply the activity of man pursuing his ends.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#10" name="10b">10)</a></sup> Another
circumstance should be remarked here. Marx is often transformed into a vulgar apostle of &quot;progress&quot;. This also does not correspond to fact. &quot;In spite of the pretensions of 'progress'
cases are always to be observed of retrogression and round-about movement.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#11" name="11b">11)</a></sup> So in Marx
there is not on the one hand a trace of fatalism, nor of Panglossian teleology on the other.<sup class="anote"><a href="#12" name="12b">12)</a></sup></P>

<P>But it does not follow from the fact that &quot;men make history&quot; that human activity is outside
the control of any laws. Society
is not a sum of isolated and mechanically united individuals. It is a definite whole, divided 
and
contradictory, with a variety in its elements. So objective social laws do not correspond with
subjective aim-purposes and they cannot be deduced from individual &quot;motivisations&quot;. On
the contrary, every individual is already born &quot;socialised&quot; and his activities are determined
by the aggregate of his conditions of life.
He already finds this environment of his life ready for him, although he also reacts upon it. Sofor Marx it was important to discover the &quot;laws of movement&quot; of the special form of
combination human society, and moreover, of historical society. It is interesting to note that a
number of Marx's critics who attack him for his so-called mechanistic approach to society,
also reproach him with starting from society and not from the human unit. Whereas it is just
from the surpassing of the mechanistic, qualityless, quantitatively mathematical conception of
society that there arises the originality of the laws of the specific whole (&quot;Totalität&quot;); 
of a
whole (and not its &quot;parts&quot;) specifically social (and not generic, special, biological, 
physico-chemical).</P>

<P>But Marx does not take this whole, society, as an empty abstraction.</P>

<P>If, for example, we begin our analysis with population, then this will be an abstraction if we
leave out classes; classes are an abstraction (&quot;leeres Wort&quot;) unless we know their elements,
and so on.</P>

<P class="quote">If [says Marx] we start out therefore with population, we do so with a chaotic idea of the whole, and by close' analysis we shall 
gradually arrive at simpler ideas; thus we shall proceed from the represented concrete to less and less complex abstractions, until we get at the simplest conception. This once attained, we
might start
on our return journey until we would finally come back to population, but this time not as a 
chaotic notion of an integral whole, but as a rich aggregate of many conceptions and 
relations.<sup class="anote"><a href="#13" name="13b">13)</a></sup></P>

<P>The method of this transition, from the chaotic conception of the concrete to the simplest 
abstract and then back to the enriched concrete aggregate, is Marx's method, a method which 
cannot be
contained within the formal-logical and usual oppositions of induction and deduction, analysis and synthesis, concrete and abstract. So the concept of society with Marx is no longer an empty
abstract and extra-historical concept, but a concept which includes the whole divided variety 
of its concrete historical definitions, which are given in their development, in correspondence 
with the real
course of the real historical process. Here Marx really solves that problem of knowledge which
Rickert considered specific for human history, the problem of the &quot;individual&quot; and the &quot;typical&quot;. Marx,
on the basis of a painstaking study of history, reached a conception of the economic structure of society which is the morphological principle of all the social whole, of &quot;the mode of 
production&quot;,
both historically of the &quot;individual&quot; (and at the same time the &quot;typical&quot;), and of the 
specific stage of historical development. Max Weber had already remarked that the &quot;individual&quot; cannot be
understood without &quot;nomological knowledge&quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#14" name="14b">14)</a></sup> But it is impossible to imagine the individual, 
even of a &quot;minor order&quot;, as a Kantian thing in itself, without relation to an &quot;other&quot;; as 
outside of all
connection with others, outside of the social aggregate. Weber is therefore forced to restore 
the &quot;generalising method&quot; buried by Rickert on the basis of Rickertian premises which have an 
absolutely
definite social sense, as do all the tendencies of the Kantian &quot;practical reason&quot;,<sup class="anote"><a href="#15" name="15b">15)</a></sup> and to 
have recourse to the construction of so-called &quot;ideal types&quot;, of a bad, idealistically 
deformed copy of the
Marxian &quot;economic formations&quot; (&quot;economic structures&quot;, i.e. &quot;means of production&quot;), 
whilst, as Tröltsch justly points out, an &quot;intellectual contemplation (Anschauung) 
of the great sociological complexes and evolutionary relations&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#16" name="16b">16)</a></sup> predominates in him.</P>

<P>So.</P>

<P>1. With Marx society is a part of nature, but a part in opposition to it, a special and 
specific part which arises historically (thus here is a unity, but not an identity; the 
division of the one).</P>

<P>2. It actively influences nature and changes it (mutual interpenetration of opposites).</P>

<P>3. It has its specific laws (social laws) which differ qualitatively from the laws of the 
inorganic world and the laws of biology (a new quality arising historically) but which are 
anything but &quot;laws&quot; of a
supernatural kind (materialism).</P>

<P>4. Society is taken in the variety of its historic definitions and in the process of its 
historical development (the dialectic of the abstract and concrete).</P>

<P>5. There is no teleological &quot;world conception&quot; in Marx (&quot;aims of history&quot;, &quot;progress&quot;, &quot;united humanity&quot;; &quot;in fact what is meant by the words 'purpose', 'aim', 'germ', 'idea' in previous history
is nothing but the abstraction of later history, the abstraction of the active influence 
exercised by past history on later history&quot;).<sup class="anote"><a href="#17" name="17b">17)</a></sup></P>

<P>The most remarkable explanation of the theory of historical materialism, with the exception of the brilliant and monumental introduction to <I>The Critique of Political Economy</I>, is undoubtedly 
the <I>German
Ideology</I>, particularly that part of it which is devoted to the criticism of Feuerbach.</P>

<P>From the very beginning the authors place the whole problem within the widest limits. &quot;We know one science alone, the science of history. History can be examined from two aspects and divided 
into
the history of nature and the history of man. But it is impossible to separate these two 
aspects from one another. So long as men exist the history of nature and human history will 
condition one
another.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#18" name="18b">18)</a></sup> In the last instance the whole further movement also conditions this division of a 
simple nature into opposing principles. The movement of this opposition, the struggle of 
society with
nature, the growing process of &quot; humanising &quot; nature, the constant penetration of the one 
opposite into
the other, lies at the bottom of the whole movement. This is
the law of development of the productive forces of society and
the basis of its self-movement. The relation to nature is an
active, practical relation, it is labour, the process of production.
Social man is above all, not an animal rationale, but homo faber,
a tool-making animal. Thus the first premise is the &quot;bodily
organisation of individuals and the connection with nature given
thereby&quot;. The production of the means of life and means of
production is the production of material life. But this production
is not the mechanical juxtaposition of separate labouring individuals, but production of which the subjects are social individuals
in a definite type of social connection. The types of this connection are explained by empirical observation. This is the &quot;productive relations&quot;, the main social division (in class society, division
in the first place into classes), that basis on which the political,
moral, philosophical, religious, etc., &quot;superstructure&quot; grows up.
Practice engenders theory, material production gives off spiritual;
the latter, with the growth of a manifold division of labour and
the fixation of the divided functions in classes (which are distinguished from one another by their relationship to the means
of production, in the first place by their position in the process
of production and distribution), is relatively split off from its
foundation and creates the illusion of sovereign independence in
the consciousness of its agents. So there arises the illusion of
an &quot;independent&quot; history of religion and morality, of law and
philosophy, of science and art, etc. Men, social-historical men
&quot;as they are conditioned by the means of production of their
material life&quot;, &quot;are the producers of their own imaginings, ideas,
etc.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#19" name="19b">19)</a></sup> The latter are thus &quot;the ideological reflections and
expressions of this vital process&quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#20" name="20b">20)</a></sup> Which far from excluding,
on the contrary, presupposes their active character. Thus society
acts on the arena of history in its concrete historical definitiveness.
Its productive forces (the unity of means of production and labour
power), its economic structure corresponding to the technical
production basis and the level of productive forces; its state
organisation, its &quot;mode of presentation&quot;, comprise a definite
morphological unity. So this historical social whole (Totalität)
appears as a concrete subject of history with a multitude of its own concrete qualities and 
corresponding definitions. The task of science is &quot;to represent the whole thing in the 
aggregate and
therefore the reaction of these different aspects on one another&quot;. But all this aggregation of influences and connections has its material basis even for the cloudiest sublimations: the 
material mode
of production and consequently, in movement, the process of direct material production of life, 
active social practice, which gets its expression in social consciousness.</P>

<P>It is not social consciousness which determines social being, but, on the contrary, social 
being as the foundation determines social consciousness.</P>

<P>But historical society is itself a dialectical unity of opposites. The process of the 
production of life, that is the process of labour, the process of the growth of productive 
forces, is its material content,
fundamental and direct. The &quot;economic structure of society&quot; is its content form in which the 
movement of productive forces takes place concretely and historically. The opposition of form 
and
content becomes a contradiction. When this contradiction between productive forces and 
productive relations breaks up the whole unity, social revolution takes place, society passes 
from one stage
into another. The juridical relations of property (the juridical translation of productive 
relations), the state superstructure, the old &quot;modes of presentation&quot;, all collapse and give place to new forms.<sup class="anote"><a href="#21" name="21b">21)</a></sup>
The old forms were once &quot;forms of development&quot;. They have been dialectically converted into &quot;fetters on development&quot;, into their own opposite. This contradiction is &quot;cancelled&quot; in the 
process
of revolution. But the process of revolution is not an automatic process: men make their own 
history.<sup class="anote"><a href="#22" name="22b">22)</a></sup> However, the laws of social development revealed by Marx tell us how great masses of 
people,
divided and united by common conditions of life, behave when these conditions of life change. 
The contradiction between the mode of production and the development of productive forces is 
shown
and expressed in a number of other contradictions which lay bare the opposition of classes, 
intensify class polarisation, sharpen class interests, produce an ideological demarcation of 
classes, force
on the formation of the class self-consciousness of the revolutionary class and its allies, and through the 
revolution of living people, through the struggle of the revolutionary class against the class which
fortifies the old productive relations in the concentrated form of its state power, through the 
destruction of this power and the smashing of its opponents' forces, through the emancipation of
productive forces and the organisation of new forms of movement of these forces, society passes 
into another form of historical being.</P>

<P>So Marx looks at society as an historically concrete society, the historical form of which is a 
transitional form. The &quot;general laws&quot; of historical development therefore include the laws of 
the
transition of one social form into another and presuppose specifically historical special laws for different social-economic formations.</P>

<P>There lies at the basis of the theory of historical materialism the materialist premise that 
all the vital wealth of society, the whole content of its complete process of life, is in the 
long run determined by
the level of power over nature, by the degree of real mastery (and thus of real change) of the external world, i.e. by the movement and self-movement of productive forces, by the process of
material
labour which always takes place in a concrete historical social form, that is to say, which is continuously connected with the economic structure of society. In relation to the material, 
productive,
motive forces and the changing economic structure of.society, the natural premises are, as 
such, a relative constant, although an extremely important constant as being historically the 
starting-point
of development. Moreover, the movement of these natural premises, as premises of social 
development, is derived from the movement of productive forces. The hidden, so-called &quot;natural resources&quot; do not function socially. They must cease to be &quot;hidden&quot;. Only when they are transformed 
from matter into material, from &quot;things in themselves&quot; into &quot;things for us&quot;, entering the 
stream of
artificial material transformation, that is the stream of the material labour process, becoming 
objects of change, are they changed (both qualitatively and quantitatively), as &quot;elements&quot; of 
social
development. But this quantitative and qualitative change is a consequence of the
development of productive forces. It is just the same also with biological &quot;human nature&quot;, 
that is with the other aspect of &quot;the natural premises&quot; for social development. &quot;Corporeal 
organisation&quot;, man of the &quot;race&quot; or &quot;species&quot;, is the historical premise of social and historical man, and 
a relatively constant one. Once again, a change in &quot;human nature&quot; (either a corporeal one or 
its spiritual
correlation) is derived from social development. The law of its development is determined by 
the law of the development of society as a whole at the basis of which lies the law of the 
development of
productive forces, that is a specifically social law. In this way one-sided &quot;geographical materialism&quot; which deduces all historical development from climatic conditions, the soil,
rainfall and water
supply, and such factors, is rejected, as also is biological materialism (i.e. positivism) 
which mechanically transfers biological laws to society and deduces the laws of social 
development from so-called &quot;human nature&quot; as its biological nature. But the materialist conception of history in 
the first place strikes a mortal blow at all forms of idealism in the social sciences. 
Phenomena of social
consciousness are derived from the phenomena of social being. The material fact of the process of the development of productive forces (or their decline) in its social-historical form, that
is the
changes in the productivity of social labour and in human relations in the process of that 
labour (productive relations), these are the main determinants which in the last resort, either 
directly or
indirectly, immediately or through a number of intermediate links, condition the changes in the 
whole sphere of superstructures, political, juridical, moral, scientific, aesthetic, 
philosophical. The
morphological unity of society (although contradictory and moreover developing these inner 
contradictions in different directions) is conditioned precisely by the fact that it has a 
single material
basis. The superficial idealist point of view in the social sciences starts from a different 
species of the forms of social consciousness, without even posing the problem of the objective determinants
of this consciousness. The materialist conception of history, on the other hand, analyses just
these material determinants, the movement of which determines the movement of the corresponding
thought forms. &quot;According to the different modes of production in different countries in 
different epochs, a hierarchy of soul, mind and understanding corresponds to the definite 
economic hierarchy
.... The psychology of classes corresponds to the hierarchy of social relations and the 
economic development of classes.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#23" name="23b">23)</a></sup> The class struggle fills the whole history of class 
societies, is the vital
nerve of the historical process. But this struggle itself, the disposition of class forces, 
their concrete combination, is conditioned by the development of a definite mode of production. 
It breaks out, on
the other hand, not only in the realm of the struggle of direct material interests, but also in 
the highest realms of ideas. Even the general forms of thought in an age express and reflect 
its specific style
and its class division, that is, in the long run they express the mode of production together 
with the level of productive forces.</P>

<P>Marx's doctrine of the movement of social-economic formations is far from being an artificial 
intellectual system. It generalises an enormous practical and theoretical experience. Of course 
&quot;economic
structures&quot; and their superstructures cannot express all the fullness of the concrete 
historical stream of full life in all its variety. But, as has already been remarked earlier, 
while poorer than life, these
generalisations are richer than the mosaic offered by banal empiricism which is usually spiced with a dose of &quot;morality&quot;. They express the main and decisive relationships, those which 
determine the
routes of historical movement. &quot;Pure capitalism&quot; is, undoubtedly, an abstraction, though in 
many cases a very useful abstraction. But &quot;impure&quot; capitalism is the reality, both as a 
combination of &quot;capitalisms&quot; and as &quot;world capitalism&quot; in whose pores the relics of pre-capitalist formations 
are also contained. Its &quot;pure class structure&quot; is, of course, an abstraction. But the class 
structure of real
capitalism is actually such a structure that the masses are composed of wage workers while the monopolists of the means of production command economy (and the state). The &quot;pure proletariat&quot; is
an abstraction. But the living unity of the mass of proletarians of various qualifications with 
its outer circumference and with a strong, real core, is a reality which is really struggling 
for its real rule.
Therefore the
doctrine of the change of historical and economic formations, as a doctrine of the process of &quot;history&quot;, adequately expresses the real historical process. The Windelband-Rickert opposition of &quot;history&quot; to &quot;theory&quot; must be put away in the archives. History as a mechanical load of 
separate facts is not history as a science. The co-ordination of individual facts and their 
ranking under the
teleological and theological command of the Kantian categorical imperative is not a science. &quot;Zweckwissenschaft&quot; à la Stammler, Stolzmann, etc.,<sup class="anote"><a href="#24" name="24b">24)</a></sup> is not a science. On the other hand, 
there can be
no scientific system which merely gives a bare scheme of abstract character. But the question 
of the empty abstract character of this or that theory is a concrete question, a question of 
the factual
analysis of that theory, a question of checking it. The opposition of &quot;theory&quot; and &quot;history&quot; is a relic of the outlook which supposed that nature has no history and therefore that its 
laws are eternal.
&quot;Natural&quot; eternal law and the shame-faced system of relations fixed by these &quot;eternal laws&quot; 
is the basis of &quot;theory&quot;. &quot;Theory&quot;, according to this view, is a system of &quot; eternal laws &quot; 
brought into
connection and formulated. History, on the other hand, is the outflow of the free creative 
spirit which creates the new, producing chiefly ever new ethical values. So human history is, 
as Stammler
expresses it, &quot;Gegenstück&quot; with regard to nature, while the sciences of the spirit are &quot;Gegenstück&quot; with regard to the natural sciences. Together with the destruction of the dualism in principle of
nature and society, of natural and social laws, there also goes the opposition in principle of
theory and history.</P>

<P>So the materialist conception of history is materialist dialectic in its specific and enriched form; it is the dialectic of a social and historical process which reveals its objective 
dialectic. Marx was the
first to deduce the laws of historical development on the basis of a wealth of material, a 
great sea of facts, a vast acquaintance with the historical material of various ages and 
peoples, an unusually
rich experience of modern European history and of the practice of the social class struggle of
which he was himself a great master in all its spheres. This is a monumental theoretical 
structure the like
of which the world has never seen. Where 
formerly &quot;chance&quot; ruled, the actions of warriors and kings,
Cleopatra's nose or Napoleon's stomach, where man saw an
incomprehensible struggle of abstractions and symbols, a bloody
carnage for the forms of religion or the sign of cross against
crescent, where idealist philosophy gave a substitute for explana
tion by compelling the &quot;spirit&quot; to embody itself permanently
in the real historical process, here for the first time real science
assumed its place, destroying the illusory connections of things
and processes and putting actual connections in their place.
Society, historical society, was scientifically &quot;discovered&quot; as
alive and complex, internally contradictory and mobile, connected
with nature and actively influencing it, a unity developing its
contradictions and passing from one qualitatively defined forma
tion to another, with peculiar specific laws. So the general laws
of social and historical development (Engels) already melt into
themselves the special laws of the movement of specific social
and historic formations expressing the specific forms of moving
contradictions. The laws of the development of feudalism, for
example, are not the same as the laws of the development of
capitalism. The laws of movement of each such formation are
original, although they also &quot;act&quot; on the basis of general laves,
established by the theory of historical materialism. Nor can it
be otherwise, for the productive forces are different (both qualita
tively and quantitatively), the economic structures are different,
the classes are different, the whole vital unity and all its con
tradictions are different. Therefore, for example, it would be
foolish to look for the law of periodical crises of over-production
in natural forms of economy just as it would be foolish to look
for flexible forms of scientific thought in stagnant societies. This
is not the consensus of Comte, with its wooden hierarchical cate
gories. Here everything is contradictory, mobile, dialectic, here
vital historical life is at play. Marx established an infinite variety
of general and partial laws of &quot;the second order&quot; besides the
vast and mighty generalisations which form the &quot;core&quot; of the
materialist conception of history. His brilliant analysis of the
groups within a class, of ideologues and practicians; his analysis
of the division of labour and the influence of this division on the
whole structure of thought; his analysis of the different forms of superstructure and, in the 
first place, his teaching on the state, which is in itself a whole revolution in thought and 
the sharpest
weapon in the practical political struggle of the proletariat,<sup class="anote"><a href="#25" name="25b">25)</a></sup> and so on, and so on, these 
are all most important achievements in science. It can be said without any exaggeration that 
his very
footnotes (the theoretical ones, of course) have nourished a whole pleiade of the most 
important minds in the camp of official science. Take, for example, his remark about the rôle 
of Protestantism in
the genesis of capitalism,<sup class="anote"><a href="#26" name="26b">26)</a></sup> which has evoked a whole literature (Sombart, Max Weber, in 
particular, Tröltsch, etc.).</P>

<P>In the theory of historical materialism the teaching on classes and class struggle has 
particular importance. Classes are the living collectors and agents of the contradictions of 
each (class, i.e.
presupposing class society) mode of production. The movement of these contradictions and their revolutionary solution runs through the class struggle in its triune economic, political and
theoretical form. Certainly the dominant ideas are the ideas of the dominant class and the 
dominant &quot;mode of presentation&quot; (or &quot;Wissensform&quot;, as Max Scheler calls it &quot;for 
originality&quot;) is the &quot;mode of presentation&quot; characteristic of it. Thus here are formed within society its living 
Totalitäten, classes of which one in the course of development becomes the revolutionary class par excellence.
Under definite historical conditions it becomes the grave-digger of the old society.</P>

<P>The materialist conception of history, with its doctrine of class struggle and revolution, is 
an objective scientific theory. It explains, by starting from the most general laws of being 
and becoming
(materialist dialectic or dialectical materialism), the general objective laws of human 
history. This is not a subjectivist structure. It is not a voluntarist theory with the will as primal and all-determining
factor. The will is limited at each given moment by definite conditions. But this theory is in
the highest degree active and revolutionary. It has nothing in common with the disgusting 
fatalistic
caricature on Marxism of which social-democracy is the organised apostle. The &quot;objectivism&quot;
of this caricature is historical fatalism, which is, in its turn, the weapon of Fascist 
activism. The Marxist doctrine of the laws of social development is an instrument for the 
overthrow of capital. It gets
its further interpretation in the theory of capitalist development, in which the general laws 
of social dialectic assume an even more concrete form as the laws of the development and doom 
of capitalist
society and the laws of its inevitable transition into socialism through the revolution of the
proletariat and its dictatorship.</P>
