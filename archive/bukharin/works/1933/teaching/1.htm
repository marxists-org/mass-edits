<H3>1. The Philosophical Synthesis of Marx</H3>

<P>Not very long ago it was extremely fashionable among official men of learning to say that Marx
had really produced nothing
new in the philosophical sphere. Such a well-known philosopher as Wilhelm Wundt in his 
<I>Introduction to Philosophy</I> wrote &quot;This lack of clarity in its metaphysical premises (i.e. of Marxism. N.B.) has a comprehensible basis in the fact that practical
questions alone interest sociological materialism. Therefore the system does not even possess 
the necessary theoretical
foundation, which it openly leaves to physiological materialism to work out.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup></P>

<P>It would be hard to find an argument so utterly ignorant and untrue as the above-quoted 
argument of Wundt. However, the
course of the social struggle and of vast ideological changes which, like the overwhelming 
movement of geological
formations, express the depth of the conflict within the perishing world of capitalism, has 
compelled consideration of the
question of Marx the philosopher. Since the publication of new works by Marx and Engels (above all the <I>German Ideology</I> and
Engels' <I>Dialectic of Nature</I>) it has become quite clear how right were the orthodox Marxians 
when they considered that in the
philosophical field also Marx fills the place due to him.</P>

<P>Indeed Marx is the creator of a great philosophical synthesis with which none of the latest and 
most fashionable
philosophical systems can be compared. Marx, as we know, reached dialectical
materialism from Hegel through Feuerbach, including all the rational elements of the preceding
thousand years of philosophical development in his system. He had a splendid knowledge of the
history of philosophy and there are no more brilliant historical and philosophical 
characterisations (both from the point of view of the social conditioning of doctrines and that 
of their &quot;immanent&quot;
logic) than certain of Marx's characterisations.<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2)</a></sup></P>

<P>In order to show the full originality of Marx's philosophical creation it is right to begin our 
analysis with the question of the relation of subject and object in which it at once becomes 
apparent that
Marx has started an absolutely new epoch in the historical development of philosophy.</P>

<P>Marx started from the premise of the objective reality of the outer world independent of the 
subject (in opposition to the subjective, idealist philosophical tradition of the Berkeley-Hume 
school,
the consistent development of which leads to solipsism). Marx was the adversary of objective 
idealism and philosophical identity when he stood the Hegelian philosophical conception on its feet.
Hence Marx was a materialist. But his materialism differs sharply in its starting-point from 
the mechanistic materialism of the great encyclopædists, from the &quot;vulgar materialism&quot; of 
Büchner and
Moleschott and from Ludwig Feuerbach's anthropological doctrine.</P>

<P>In Marx's philosophy the object is treated in an absolutely exceptional manner.</P>

<P class="indent">1. It is an historically developing &quot;quantity&quot;. The world, the cosmos, has its history. Nature is 
not an unchanging &quot;datum&quot;. On the contrary, it changes dialectically, its laws are also 
historical.</P>

<P class="indent">2. It is not abstract, qualityless, grey matter, as it appeared to mechanistic materialism. It 
includes a variety of qualitative definitions with different forms of movements passing one 
into the other.<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">3)</a></sup></P>

<P class="indent">3. The object, as object, is historical in another sense also, and that is: it grows in 
accordance as the penetration of man into nature expands. &quot;Even objects of the simplest 'sensual authenticity' are only given it (the subject. N.B.) thanks to social 
development, thanks to industry and commercial relations. It is well known that the cherry tree...only
appeared in our zone a few centuries ago thanks to commerce....&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">4)</a></sup></P>

<P class="indent">4. The object is historical since it is to a certain degree itself the product of the 
historical activity of the historical subject. Feuerbach, for example, &quot;does not discern that the sensual world about
him is not something directly given from eternity, a thing always equal to itself, but the 
product of industry and a social state, the product in the sense that in each historical epoch
it is the result of
the activity of a whole number of generations, each of which stands on the shoulders of the 
preceding generations....&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">5)</a></sup> &quot;Of course,&quot; Marx adds, having in mind the clever people who may
absolutise these arguments, inflate them and convert the process of the &quot;humanising&quot; of 
nature into a proof of the absence of the objective world, &quot;at the same time the priority of 
external nature
is preserved, and, of course, this has no relation to the primal men born by means of generatio 
æquivoca.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">6)</a></sup></P>

<P>1. It is not the abstraction of the intellectual side of human activity brought into 
independent existence. In fact, the subject of bourgeois philosophy is a castrated subject, 
deprived of the
completeness of its vital functions. The subject of Marxist philosophy is a complete subject. 
The dull and intellectual abstraction of the merely intellectual side of man is a reflection of 
the division
of social labour in which the functions of thought congeal into definite social groups, when 
the so-called &quot;spiritual production&quot; is separated from the material, i.e. from &quot;the direct 
production of
life&quot;, when the relative cleavage in social life evokes a cleavage and absolutising of the 
category of thought and creates the illusion of a separate intellect.</P>

<P>2. Subject is not an isolated human atom but &quot;socialised&quot; man. &quot;We&quot; is already contained in 
the pores of the philosophical &quot;I&quot;. Philosophical Robinsonades are just as impermisisible as Robinsonades in the social sciences.<sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">7)</a></sup> &quot;The individual is a social being. Therefore his manifestation of life (even if not expressed directly in the form of a collective 
expression of life taking
place simultaneously with others) is a manifestation and expression of social life.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">8)</a></sup> It is, 
as expressed above, a whole. But this is a whole of a socialised, social man. The Feuerbachian position starts
from anthropology, whereas the real basis is here not the biological species (homo sapiens), 
but a new form of being, a specific, qualitatively different form, the form of human society. &quot;Therefore,&quot; Marx defines brilliantly, &quot;although man is to a certain extent a separate individual, and it 
is precisely separation which makes him an individual and a real individual social being-he is also a whole...the subjective being of a society thought and felt for itself, just as he exists in reality, on the one hand, as contemplation and the real spirit of social being, and on the other as the completion of the human manifestation of life. Thus, though being and thinking differ from one another, they are 
at the same time in unity with one another.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">9)</a></sup></P>

<P>3. But the subject is not merely social subject, but also socialhistorical subject. Society is concrete historical society, it passes through different phases of its historical development.
Feuerbach &quot;examines 'man in general', instead of 'real historical man'&quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#10" name="10b">10)</a></sup> The peculiarities of social 
structure, of the historical mode of production, have also peculiarities of the adequate &quot;mode of presentation&quot;,
the special forms of thinking, in dependence on the historical phase of social development, of the class dominants in life, etc. Thus the subject is not an abstraction of man, not a 
personified &quot;species&quot; or &quot;kind&quot; and not even social man in general. The subject is social-historical man.</P>

<P>4. It also follows from the above that the subject is an active subject, and above all 
practically active, producing the direct conditions for its own existence. The deepest cleavage 
in society is the
division between mental and physical labour.</P>

<P class="quote">The division of labour becomes a real division of labour only
when the division between material and spiritual labour begins.
From this moment consciousness can really imagine itself to be 
nothing but the consciousness of existing practice. From the moment consciousness really begins to represent something which represents nothing real, from that moment it is in the condition where it
emancipates itself from the world and passes on to the formation of &quot;pure theory&quot;, of 
theology, philosophy, morality, etc.<sup class="anote"><a href="#11" name="11b">11)</a></sup></P>

<P>Before Marx, it was just this separated theoretical consciousness of the crippled and 
dissociated individual whose very dissociation is a social-historical fact, which congealed 
into the philosophical
subject. The thinking and contemplative functions, torn away from the active and practical, 
thinking about the world which had relatively got away from the practice of changing the world, 
evoked the
illusion of an independent and sovereign &quot;movement of the soul&quot;, with its independent &quot;immanent&quot; logic for this movement.</P>

<P>From the above there follows also Marx's special position in the question of the relationship 
between subject and object. It is particularly necessary to dwell on this question because the problem of
the reality (i.e. unreality) of the external world is connected with it, as well as the problem 
of the knowledge of the latter and the question of the criteria of knowledge, i.e. almost all 
the main questions of
philosophy.</P>

<P>The fact is that in pre-Marxian philosophy the relations between object and subject were only 
looked upon as relations between the abstraction of the intellect and the object of knowledge. This
relationship it was which made the starting-point for all further analysis. Here Marx 
fundamentally changed the whole approach to the question. Particularly striking is the point of 
view he formulates in
the following criticism of A. Wagner's methodological approach.<sup class="anote"><a href="#12" name="12b">12)</a></sup> Marx writes</P>

<P class="quote">...In this doctrinaire professor the relations of man to nature appear from the very 
beginning not as practical relations, i.e. founded on actions, but as theoretical ones.... 
But men in no wise begin by &quot;standing in theoretical relation to the objects of the external world&quot;. Like other animals, they &quot;begin&quot; by eating, drinking, etc., i.e. they do not &quot;stand&quot; in any relation but act vigorously, and with
the aid of action they master certain objects of the external world and in this way satisfy 
their needs (consequently they begin with production).</P>

<P>So with Marx both the historical and the logical prius is practice. This is far from implying 
that theoretical questions did not interest Marx (a hyper-foolish statement which academic 
philosophy
expressed through Wilhelm Wundt). This means that profound theory advances the theoretical 
argument which exposes the main, real, actual connections. The prius is practice, practical 
activity, the
practical changing of the world as the chief function of living, social, historical man. &quot;Consciousness (bewusstes Sein)&quot;, as Marx with genius points out, &quot;can never be anything else 
but conscious
being, and the being of men is the real process of their life.&quot; Consequently the 
social-historical consciousness of social, historical man grows on the basis of practice.</P>

<P>These arguments completely upset the usual starting-points of school philosophers. In fact the primary datum to &quot;me&quot; of &quot;my&quot; &quot;sensations&quot; is considered logically irrefutable. If this 
is the starting-point, the material, etc., of the process of knowledge, then it is impossible to extricate 
oneself from the circle of this &quot;datum&quot;,just as it is impossible to extricate oneself by the 
hair from a bog.</P>

<P>But this &quot;starting-point&quot;, which is actually the product of a complicated analysis, is not 
the real starting-point, the subject has no unmixed &quot;pure sensations&quot;, unless he is some 
mythical primitive
Adam. Along with sensations, in connection with them, and so on, conceptions are present which are a social product. Behind every conception stands the whole path of social-historical 
development
(just because the subject is a socialised subject; behind &quot;I&quot;, &quot;we&quot; is already concealed). 
Not the passive reception of sensations but active, practical doing <sup class="anote"><a href="#13" name="13b">13)</a></sup> is the primal and 
initial. So in the usual
so-called irrefutable proof of the subjectivity of the primal &quot;datum&quot; we are &quot;given&quot; 
extremely important logical gaps which refute the whole line of this proof. A Robinsonade with a passively
contemplative character is the &quot;starting-point&quot; of the dissected &quot;starting-point&quot; of 
academic philosophy.</P>

<P>But the further theses of Marxism arise from this and are in their turn connected with it.</P>

<P>The external world (the object) and the social-historical subject are placed in a relationship
of reciprocity, while the main feature of this reciprocity is the active changing of the world. 
Hence the
question of the gnoseological importance of practice in general and of technics in particular. With Marx the question of the possibility of knowledge is connected with the question of the 
possibility of
changing the world. The praxiological moment is directly interwoven into gnoseology. Goethe's 
Faust is right when he says in his philosophical monologue:</P>

<P class="quoteb">Tis written: <I>In the beginning was the Word</I>.<BR>
Already I stick, and who shall help afford?<BR>
The <I>word </I>at such high rate I may not tender;<BR>
The passage must I elsewise render.<BR>
If rightly by the Spirit I am taught,<BR>
Tis written: <I>In the beginning was the Thought</I>.<BR>
By the first line a moment tarry,<BR>
Let not thine eager pen itself o'er hurry!<BR>
Does <I>thought </I>work all and fashion all outright?<BR>
It should stand: <I>In the beginning was the Might</I>.<BR>
Yet even as my pen the sentence traces,<BR>
A warning hint the half-writ word effaces.<BR>
The Spirit helps me-from all doubting freed,<BR>
Thus write I: <I>In the beginning was the Deed</I>.</P>

<P>The question may be put in this way. The problem of the relationship between subject and object 
is the problem of the process of mastering the object. But mastery may be either practical 'or
theoretical. Practical mastery (the starting-point) engenders theoretical mastery, which is 
also checked by practice, which enriches practice and, in its turn, receives from practice 
supplementary
impulses on a new basis. Practice and theory are activity. They are, while practice remains 
primary, mutually connected; they &quot;reciprocate&quot;, they pass into one another, here there is 
no identity but
there is unity. If, therefore, the theory <I>a</I> is connected with the practice <I>a</I>, which produces a given change in the external world <I>x</I>, then that is the checking of practice by the truth of 
theory. The &quot;accursed&quot; question of &quot;things in themselves&quot; which Kant declared to lie on the other side of 
knowledge, was discredited by Hegel as being objectless, for &quot;the thing in itself&quot; is an 
abstraction from
any relationship to another, i.e. is something, &quot;wahrheitslose leere Abstraktion&quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#14" name="14b">14)</a></sup>
Marx <sup class="anote"><a href="#15" name="15b">15)</a></sup> formulates this problem from the point of view of his theory of knowledge as being: &quot;The question if objective truth is possible to human thought is not a
theoretical but a practical question. In practice man must prove the truth, that is the reality 
and force of his actual thoughts. The dispute as to the reality or non-reality of thought separated from practice, is a purely scholastic question.&quot; This is not 
naïveté, as certain naïve (or make-believe naïve?) critics of Marx pretend. It is
the profoundest form in which the problem can be put, the placing of it on a new, unusual 
basis.<sup class="anote"><a href="#16" name="16b">16)</a></sup> In the circle (practice-theory-enriched practice), theory is the
aspect of this, figuratively speaking, enlarged reproduction of life, this enlarged process of mastering nature. There cannot be such mastery (i.e. an expedient &quot;changing of the world&quot;) unless an adequate practice corresponds to it. There can be no 
successful practice unless its theoretical expression (&quot;conscious practice&quot;) is
&quot;true&quot;, i.e. adequate to reality. This by no means excludes contradictions between the links 
of the process of mastering nature taken as a whole. But this does not
immediately make clear the question of the criteria of truth, for the criterion of 
correspondence with reality and the so-called &quot;practical criterion of truth&quot; (if it is a
matter of the practice of real change of the real world) coincide, while the &quot;power of thought&quot;, its truth, its adequacy are proved by the process of real mastery of
the world, by the process of its change.</P>

<P>Marx in this way lifted materialism to unparalleled 
heights. The limitation of old-fashioned materialism, its purely
quantitative theorems, its mechanistic character, the qualityless character of its matter, the absence of understanding of the specific forms of movement and specific
laws, its anti-historical nature, its passively-contemplative nature, etc., were all overcome 
by Marx. He succeeded in doing this because he made a synthesis of
materialism and dialectics. He raised the dialectical method to its highest degree, refashioned 
it critically, turned upside down the vastness of the Hegelian
philosophical conception and finished for ever with Hegelian panology with its &quot;drunken&quot; 
philosophical speculation. The movement of conceptions which formed
the essence of the historical process with Hegel has been transformed
by Marx into the ideological reflex of the history of real human life, the dialectic of thought 
into the reflex of the dialectic of material social development. But the
dialectical forms of movement, embracing nature, society and thought itself, have become with 
Marx the main element of his splendid philosophical system.</P>

<P>The deepest revolutionary historicism which penetrates all Marx's teaching from its most 
generalised heights down to the immediate practical conclusions, is
genetically connected with a critically refashioned Hegelian dialectic. The compressed 
description of dialectic which Marx makes in the preface to Volume I of
<I>Capital</I> is well known:</P>

<P class="quote">My own dialectical method is not only fundamentally different from the Hegelian dialectical method, but is its direct opposite. For Hegel, the thought process
(which he actually transforms into an independent subject, giving to it the name of &quot;idea &quot;) 
is the demiurge (creator) of the real; and for him the real is only the
outward manifestation of the idea. In my view, on the other hand, the ideal is nothing other 
than the material when it has been transposed and translated inside the
human head.</P>

<P class="quote">Nearly thirty years ago, when Hegelianism was still fashionable, I criticised the mystifying 
aspect of the Hegelian dialectic. But at the very time when I was working
at the first volume of <I>Das Kapital</I>, the peevish and arrogant mediocrities who nowadays have the 
ear of the educated public in Germany, were fond of treating Hegel
much as in Lessing's day the world of Moses Mendelssohn used to treat Spinoza, namely as a &quot;dead dog&quot;. That was why I frankly proclaimed myself a disciple of
that great thinker, and even, in <I>Das Kapital</I>, toyed with the use of Hegelian terminology when 
discussing the theory of value. Although in Hegel's hands dialectic
underwent a mystification, this does not obviate the fact that he was the first to expound the general forms of its movement in a comprehensive and fully conscious
way. In Hegel's writings, dialectic stands on its head. You must turn it right way up again if
you want to discover the rational kernel that is hidden away within the
wrappings of mystification.</P>

<P class="quote">In its mystified form, dialectic became the fashion in Germany
because it seemed to elucidate the existing state o£ affairs. In its
rational form it is a scandal and an abomination to the bourgeoisie
and its doctrinaire spokesmen, because, while supplying a positive
understanding of the existing state of things, it at the same time
furnishes an understanding of the negation of that state of things,
and enables us to recognise that that state of things will inevitably
break up; it is an abomination to them because it regards every
historically developed social form as in fluid movement, as transient;
because it lets nothing overawe it, but is in its very nature critical and
revolutionary.<sup class="anote"><a href="#17" name="17b">17)</a></sup></P>

<P>The main lines of the synthesis are compressed into this little extract, but the synthesis is 
anything but a mechanical juxtaposing of materialism and dialectic. Matter is primary. 
Consciousness is a
new property, a new quality of a special form of matter. The material is &quot;expressed&quot; in 
consciousness. Therefore knowledge is adequate to reality. But this &quot;expression&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#18" name="18b">18)</a></sup> is not a 
passive
expression. Knowledge is active and effective. It is far from being the statement of sensations 
received from the external world and the formation of &quot;complexes&quot; of these sensations, on the 
basis of
which, as the &quot;mere empiricists&quot; of to-day affirm, nothing but tautologies are erected. On 
the one hand, insofar as human practice develops, the very material of knowledge is enlarged, 
its &quot;raw material&quot;, and the radius of knowledge increases in length. On the other hand, knowledge 
actively refashions this material, thought gnaws into it (the problem of &quot;inferred knowledge&quot;), and the
results of this process, its products, much more truly &quot;express&quot; objective reality (and 
therefore theoretical and really scientific knowledge is higher, truer, deeper than superficial 
empiricism). Never
absolutely, always more or less one-sidedly, asymptotically, it approaches the &quot;whole&quot; 
truth-in this is the process of historical development. But the richer and more many-sided it 
is, the &quot;truer&quot; it
is, the more successful, the wider is the practice on the basis of which it grows and which it fertilises in its turn. The &quot;ideal&quot; is consequently &quot;the material transposed and translated 
inside the human
head&quot;. Dialectic becomes materialist. It examines from this point of view &quot;every historically 
developed form in movement&quot;, that is &quot;from its transient aspect&quot;.</P>

<P>The importance attributed to dialectic by Marx and Engels is also evident from another side. If 
in the extract quoted above Marx emphasised the necessity of making dialectic materialist, then 
Engels
with no less force emphasises the necessity of making materialism dialectic. In criticising the 
so-called &quot;naturalscientific&quot; materialism he makes the remark that it is essential 
&quot;to go over to dialectic. There are two philosophical tendencies, the metaphysical with 
unchanging categories and the dialectic (Aristotle and particularly Hegel) with' fluid 'ones.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#19" name="19b">19)</a></sup> &quot;Hegel, whose
synthesis and rational grouping of natural science are a greater affair than all the 
metaphysical nonsense taken together.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#20" name="20b">20)</a></sup> There is no contradiction here. On the contrary, such 
an approach shows
that it is a question of the organic synthesis made by Marx's creative genius.</P>

<P>The transitory character of every form, its arising, its development and destruction; the 
absence of absolute limits and at the same time the zig-zag character of development, the 
passing of quantity
into quality; quantitative continuity and qualitative interruption; the division of the one, 
the inner contradictoriness of each whole; the development of this contradiction, the struggle of opposites
as the immanent law of movement; the passing of one opposite into another, the negation of the
old form and its co-presence in the new in &quot;sublated form&quot;, the contradiction between form and
content; the relation of each thing to others, the many-sidedness of connections, the 
universality of connections; the different types of connections (not only of causal order but 
also of coexisting
connections) and other general laws of being and becoming make up the distinctive peculiarities 
of dialectic which fixes and formulates these laws theoretically. <sup class="anote"><a href="#21" name="21b">21)</a></sup></P>

<P>&quot;Briefly dialectic may be defined as the teaching of the unity of opposites. The kernel of 
dialectic is grasped in this,&quot; Lenin remarks.<sup class="anote"><a href="#22" name="22b">22)</a></sup> And this is absolutely just. It is precisely 
for this reason that
dialectic, dialectical historicism and the dialectical teaching on development are 
fundamentally different from the bourgeois &quot;theory of evolution&quot; as it flourishes in the 
natural and social sciences of
the bourgeoisie. It is just because of this that dialectic is the &quot;algebra of revolution&quot; if 
we strip it of its mystical skin of specific Hegelianism (&quot;Hegelei&quot;, as Marx called it). 
Bourgeois historicism and
evolutionism arose to a certain degree as a reaction against the theory of catastrophes and 
revolutionary rationalism of the encyclopædists. Gradualness, continuity, &quot;organology&quot; were 
brought
forward as heavy artillery
against the &quot;leaps&quot; in social history. The very idea of historicism stands far above abstract 
rationalism. But it had an inner weakness and even with Hegel the Prussian state held up the 
current of
history, while the contradiction between the essentially revolutionary method and the 
conservative system was the inner cause of the decay and doom of this astonishing philosophical 
conception.
Marx abolished these contradictions. In his materialist doctrine dialectic became an organic 
component part, the basis of the whole conception. We have seen above how, in distinction from all
preceding philosophers, Marxism sharply emphasises the historical nature of the object, which 
itself develops dialectically, and the historical nature of the subject which also goes through 
the phases
of its own dialectical development. The main laws of dialectic appear in the very relation 
between object and subject. Object and subject are a unity, for society is not a supernatural 
quantity. But this
unity is not an identity; object and subject are opposed. The struggle of these opposites 
drives on history, while these opposites interpenetrate one another (the process of the 
influence of nature on
society, the process of the &quot;humanising&quot; of nature): society has in the last resort grown 
out of nature but it is not dead matter and not a biological species. It is matter with a 
specific quality in that its
relation to nature is an active relationship, practical and theoretical. Theory and practice 
are a unity but a contradictory unity. Society itself is a unity, but again a contradictory 
one. The contradiction
between its form and content (productive forces and productive relations) expressed in the 
opposition of classes (in class society) is the motive force of historical development, and so on. In this way
materialist dialectic formulates the general connections and laws of nature, society and 
thought itself. Materialist dialectic is the basis of the whole doctrine of Marx and at the 
same time a general
method of investigation. It stands in the same relation to formal logic, with its shamefaced, 
statistical categories, as higher mathematics to lower. It is the logic of contradictory 
processes and universal
connections in which abstractions are concrete, analysis and synthesis indivisible, boundaries
conditioned and conceptions flexible to the maximum degree.</P>

<P>Thus dialectic, when it became materialist dialectic, entered a new stage in its development.</P>

<P>&quot;In its really logical sense&quot;, even Tröltsch has to write, &quot;dialectic has been preserved and 
further developed in a considerable and fruitful manner, beyond Hegel's limits of the knowable, 
only by
Marxism.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#23" name="23b">23)</a></sup> In this respect the dialectic of Marx and, Engels has appeared &quot;astonishing, 
their statement of the problem is one of the most revealing which the century has produced.&quot; 
Thus &quot;the new
conception of dialectic&quot; has above all a protracted value.<sup class="anote"><a href="#24" name="24b">24)</a></sup></P>

<P>Marxism's theory of knowledge, as appears from what has gone before, has its own absolutely exceptional peculiarities, since its starting-points are not like those of other philosophical systems, even
including the materialist: there is another object, another subject, and a different 
relationship between them. Marxism's theory of knowledge is sociological. Its abstractions are
abstractions of a logical
order completely different from the usual abstractions of philosophy. In connection with this 
Marxism is confronted with the special problem of the forms of knowledge which are produced 
from the
forms of material life. In other words, if a definite &quot;mode of presentation&quot; corresponds to a 
definite &quot;mode of production&quot;, then this problem of the &quot;mode of presentation&quot; in its 
connection with an
historical class subject, the agent of this or that &quot;mode of presentation&quot;, is a problem sui 
generis. The relation between a socially-conditioned mode of presentation and the degree of 
adequacy of
knowledge consists, on the whole, in the fact that the class which is the agent of a higher 
mode of production (i.e. of a mode of production in which the productive forces are more 
powerful, in which
the process of mastering nature is going on more intensively and the productivity of labour is higher) is also the agent of a higher &quot;mode of presentation&quot; (i.e. of such a mode of 
presentation as
permits of more rapidly and adequately knowing the objective world).</P>

<P>Marxist philosophy as the most perfect of philosophical systems owes this in the first place to 
materialist dialectic, with its wide horizons, its historicism and variability in past, present 
and future,
whereas the bourgeoisie is drawn to &quot;eternal categories&quot;, with its
bold statement of the problem of interruption and continuity, whereas the bourgeoisie dreads 
&quot;leaps&quot;, with its strict determinism which infinitely broadens the field of science, as opposed 
to the
indeterminism of bourgeois-idealist doctrines, with the doctrine of the infinite possibilities of knowledge as opposed to the different forms of agnosticism and the Kantian teaching of the
unknowability of the thing in itself, etc. This dual nature of the forms of consciousness of 
our age is the reflection of the antagonistic mode of production and of the opposition between
the
bourgeoisie, whose modes of thought have become fetters on its future development, just as the forms of capitalist society have become fetters on the development of productive forces, and the
proletariat, which advances new forms of thought, a new &quot;mode of presentation&quot;, formulated 
theoretically as dialectical materialism.</P>

<P>There are grains of reason in every system. The bourgeoisie could not exist if its theory was 
only nonsense in all its parts, from beginning to end. Only rationalists and metaphysicians can 
argue in this
way. But this does not prevent it from being reactionary in relation to the theory of the 
proletariat. Therefore, whenever the ideologues of the bourgeoisie advance a &quot;fashionable&quot; 
doctrine, in our
age, the age of intense strains, of crises, of decay of capitalism, it is usually a 
reactionary, mystical doctrine and its rational grains are already contained in rational form 
in the Marxist conception. Here
are a few examples to clarify our thought.</P>

<P>1. At present so-called axiology, &quot;the philosophy of values&quot; (Rickert and others) <sup class="anote"><a href="#25" name="25b">25)</a></sup>, has a 
certain importance in official bourgeois science. Growing out of the problems of the &quot;philosophy of history&quot;
and the methodology of the social sciences, it has become a whole metaphysical system. As is 
well known Rickert stands for a general demarcation from the natural sciences in the 
methodology of
history. The natural sciences are generalising in method, while the social sciences are 
historical. Their object is non-repetitive and individual. This individual choice must go along 
the line of
correspondence with values, i.e. &quot;cultural values&quot;. Hence a refined doctrine of values as a 
result of which all philosophy is transformed into a doctrine of values. Logically the whole of this theory 
cannot stand criticism. Nature has its history, just as society does, although the history of 
nature is not the
same as the history of society. Therefore the whole justification for two methods, different in 
principle, is fundamentally untrue. The introduction of the teleological value aspect is in 
principle quite
impermissible. Its concrete expression is simply impossible, since the criteria of values 
(which with these ideologues all tend towards one or another variation of Kantian morality) are 
quite undefined.
The whole doctrine degenerates into the moralising metaphysic and metaphysical morality of &quot;axiology&quot;. Here, however, there is concealed in mystical form a real problem, the problem of 
the social
and cultural function of knowledge (both of the natural and social sciences). But Marxism 
solves this problem splendidly with its teaching of the relations of theory and practice, of 
the social and vital
functions of knowledge, while at the same time it shows the door to any kind of teleology.</P>

<P>2. Not very long ago in the general aggregate of bourgeois ideology pragmatism played a very 
important part (W. James in the first place).<sup class="anote"><a href="#26" name="26b">26)</a></sup> Pragmatism emphasised with energy the practical 
criterion
of truth, the &quot;instrumental&quot; point of view. The &quot;truth&quot; of any premise is measured by its 
practical benefit. James examines religious-sit venia verbo-&quot;truths&quot; from this point of view. 
They comfort
and are therefore true, because beneficial. In experience, including religious experience, in 
mystical illumination, in ecstasy, in any &quot;experience&quot;, these truths are shown to be valuable 
and beneficial <sup class="anote"><a href="#27" name="27b">27)</a></sup>
just as much as in the rough empiricism of daily life. This doctrine is logically 
unsustainable. It expands the conception of experience to include any kind of individual 
experience, a point of view which
makes, for example, the existence of hallucinations equivalent to the existence of any material 
object, God the same kind of reality as the President of the United States and the practice of prayer, the
commerce of stocks and shares, ore mining, in no way different from one another in principle. 
The chief mistake in pragmatism is the fundamentally incorrect conception of practice as a 
theoretically-knowable factor. In reality only such a practice may here have meaning as changes the 
material world (Marx's &quot;revolutionary Praxis&quot;). Only in such a case is the criterion of 
practice not
separated from the criterion of correspondence with reality. Only in such conditions can the 
problem of the adequacy of knowledge be correctly stated and correctly solved (and this, after all, is the
decisive gnoseological question). A grain of reason was concealed in the mystical formulations
of pragmatism, that fashionable reactionary doctrine of the end of the nineteenth and beginning 
of the
twentieth century. But this factor already exists in Marx in its real meaning and is fully 
worked out as one of the most important main parts of his philosophical synthesis.</P>

<P>3. Recently a great re-orientation from quantitative to qualitative analysis has been taking 
place along the whole front of philosophy and the higher sciences. The idea of &quot;totality&quot;, &quot;the whole&quot;, &quot;the all&quot; (Totalität, das Ganze, Ganzheit, etc.), the idea of a qualitatively special complete 
form (Gestalt), is at present the most fashionable idea. This is expressed philosophically in 
the resurrection of
Fichteanism and Hegelianism (&quot;Neo-Hegelianism&quot;), in the transition from the causal method to 
the so-called &quot;organic&quot; and teleological, and so on.</P>

<P>The &quot;Whole&quot; frequently assumes the form of a super-sensitive substance, unapproachable by 
rational knowledge and only approachable by &quot;intuition&quot;, &quot;sensitiveness&quot;, by mystical forms 
of
direct &quot;vision&quot;. It is on this foundation that Driesch's biological metaphysics has arisen, 
with its doctrine of the organic whole, its doctrine of entelechy which gives &quot;aim and 
direction&quot; to
development. It is on this foundation that such systems as O. Spann's &quot;Universalism&quot; arise in 
the economic sciences. Thus the anti-mechanistic idea of a qualitatively specific whole assumes 
an
idealist, teleological and even theological character. Quality is here absolutely separated 
from quantity, the whole is absolutely separated from its parts and is hypostasised as a 
supernatural category
lying outside the objects of rational knowledge. All such constructions are ultra-reactionary 
and a merciless war is necessary against them. But, rationally understood, the idea of the 
whole, that is
taken in its relative opposition to its parts, 
in its materialist characteristic, is correct. It is, however, in such an interpretation found completely in Marx's dialectical materialism. The real dialectic of the whole and the parts, of 
quantity and
quality, of form and content, is given in Marx, and what is more, given on a materialist basis. 
This synthesis is infinitely higher than the modern pitiful efforts at deep thought whose only
&quot;deep
thought&quot; consists in serving the practice of the most reactionary classes of our time and of 
the vilest obscurantism.</P>

<P>4. Finally, it is worth while mentioning the philosophical problems connected with the crisis 
of modern mathematics and physics. Carnap <sup class="anote"><a href="#28" name="28b">28)</a></sup> writes in this connection: &quot;Even more insistent 
has
become the necessity for a new logical system as soon as the definite contradictions ('antinomies') became noticeable first of all in the mathematical sphere, and which then rapidly 
revealed
themselves as contradictions of a general logical significance. They could only be overcome by a fundamental reorganisation of logic.&quot; Like ideas are developed also by a whole number of
outstanding physicists who similarly issue the call for a &quot;new logic&quot;.</P>

<P>The development of mechanics (the quantum theory) has put before us the problem of the relation 
between interruption and continuity, which, since they are contradictory, go beyond the limits of
formal academic logic (&quot;dualism &quot; of the wave-particle). Outside the bounds of formal logic 
there also pass the problems of dynamic and static law, of the whole and its parts, of matter 
and energy, of
time and space, of mass on the one hand and time and space on the other, etc. All this vast 
series of problems recently brought forward by the development of the exact sciences can no 
longer be
contained within the one-sided, immobile, rational categories of the old logic, the laws of 
which are only significant in definite and limited conditions. The &quot;antinomies&quot; of modern 
natural science
made a powerful call for a methodological approach corresponding to the new, more complex, 
manysided, objectively dialectical forms of the real connections and laws of being and 
becoming.<sup class="anote"><a href="#29" name="29b">29)</a></sup>
Hence on the basis of bourgeois forms of thought, with all the sociological premises of to-day, 
there takes place a transition to an a-logical, super-rational, irrational and even religious treatment of the object. But this transition itself conceals, as 
we have seen, a real scientific treatment of the series of problems by covering it with the 
heavy clouds of the
new mysticism. A real solution of the problem can however be given here also on the basis of 
the positive application of the method of dialectical materialism worked out by Marx.</P>

<P>Thus, Marxian philosophy appears before us as a grand philosophical synthesis, as a mighty 
theoretical system which has included all that is really of value that has been produced by the
development of human culture and human thought. This immense synthesis could only arise as the system of ideas of a class which is practically compelled in its work and its struggle to 
overcome,
first of all from within and then throughout society, the cleavage of the capitalist social 
order, and, in consequence, the cleavage and absolutising of its mental categories and their 
metaphysical static
character. Subject and object, theory and practice, thought and action, presentation and will,
are all taken not only in their opposition, but also in their unity. Philosophy for the first 
time reaches its
sociological self-knowledge. It becomes at the same time a powerful weapon of proletarian 
struggle; it is critical and revolutionary to the highest degree; it overthrows all the idols 
and fetishes of the
old world; it is anti-theological, anti-teleological, anti-idealist; it is active; it is 
full of the optimism of knowledge and contemptuously rejects any principle of &quot;Ignorabimus&quot;. 
On the background of
the present collapse of bourgeois ideology in general and of bourgeois philosophy in particular 
it grows as the only theoretical generalisation which embodies the whole future of humanity.</P>

<P>Bourgeois society by continually developing its inner contradictions has reached such a 
critical point that its latent division has become open and is tearing the whole capitalist 
covering. The
proletariat, the child of capitalism, is really becoming its gravedigger. Bourgeois society 
reached the highest form of its selfknowledge in Hegel's universal system. In developing its 
contradictions this
system gave birth to Marxism which became the system of ideas of the proletariat. To-day the 
bourgeoisie is again seizing on the conservative side of the once mighty system
of its greatest philosopher and, purging it of any really valuable elements, is coming out 
under the flag of neo-Hegelianism. But it is not Chronos who devours his own children. This is
only an old
myth. The proletariat strikes a mortal blow at capitalism. Marxism liquidates the outworn 
mental categories of the capitalist world.</P>

In this connection it is worth citing Marx's characterisation of materialism after Bacon.
&quot;In its further development materialism becomes one-sided. Hobbes is a systematiser of Baconian materialism.
