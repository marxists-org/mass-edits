<H3>4. The Theory of Proletarian Dictatorship and Scientific Communism</H3>

<P>The analysis of capitalist society made by Marx explains the main &quot;laws of motion&quot; of this 
society, the specific laws of this specific historical-economic structure. It appears that the
development of capitalism develops
all its objective internal contradictions, prepares the material prerequisites of socialism 
within the bosom of capitalist society, sharpens the contradictions of interests among the 
classes which are the main contradictions
of capitalism, leads to the revolution of the proletariat and guarantees its victory. However, the very course of the proletarian revolution, which shows itself as the highest type of class
struggle and passes over into civil
war, brings the problem of revolution far outside the bounds of the interrelations of economics 
and politics, of the social-economic structure and its political superstructure, as well as of those transformations of
catastrophic order which inevitably arise in the course of the victorious struggle of the 
proletariat.</P>

<P>Here we must dwell above all on the general theory of the state as developed by Marx and 
Engels. Surely in no sphere of social science has so much idealist and even mystical fog 
collected as in the doctrine of the state,
that citadel of the concentrated power of the ruling classes. The idea of the &quot;eternity&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup> of this institution, its 
obligatory character for every form of human community, its universality and extra-historical 
nature, has been and still is prevalent
as the main dogma of the majority of bourgeois theories of the state and of the law, 
independently of whether we are faced with the elaborations of &quot;sociology&quot; or specific 
&quot;juridical formalism&quot;,which looks upon the state
and law as an autonomous sphere developing according to its own laws and in no way 
fundamentally determined by other aspects of social development. With Marx and Engels the state is above all an historical category,
and furthermore, historical in the dual sense of the word. That is, in the first place it only arises in accordance with definite social and historical conditions, together with the rise of
private property and the division of
society into classes. It &quot;dies out&quot; together with the disappearance of classes. So it has its 
historical beginning and its historical end. Its existence does not coincide with the existence 
of society as such. It is not an
indispensable attribute. In the second place, it is also historical in the sense that it really 
only exists in its concrete historical form of an adequate, historical-concrete, 
social-economic formation. Consequently, just as, in
the sphere of economic categories, means of production only become capital under definite 
conditions, under a definite historic form, in exactly the same way society appears in a state form only under definite conditions.
Just as in the sphere of the doctrine of society as a whole, &quot;general laws&quot; (Engels) include a wealth of laws of historically determined, concrete &quot;formations&quot;, &quot;means of production&quot;, 
&quot;economic structures&quot;, so in the
sphere of state doctrine its general definitions include a wealth of concrete and specific 
forms of state power.</P>

<P CLASS="quote">The state, then, is by no means a power forced on society from outside; neither is it the &quot;realisation of the ethical idea&quot;, &quot;the image and the realisation of reason&quot;, as Hegel 
maintains. It is simply a product of society at
a certain stage of evolution. It is the confession that this society has become hopelessly 
divided against itself, has entangled itself in irreconcilable contradictions which it is 
powerless to banish. In order that these
contradictions, these classes with conflicting economic interests, may not annihilate 
themselves and society in a useless struggle, a power becomes necessary that 
stands apparently above society and has the function of keeping down the conflicts and 
maintaining &quot;order&quot;. And this power, the outgrowth of society, but assuming supremacy over it 
and becoming more and more
divorced from it, is the state.<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2)</a></sup></P>

<P>Thus the state is the product of the class division of society. Being the product of the 
development of society as a whole, it is also a completely class organisation. Functioning as a 
force which &quot;moderates&quot; the conflicts
of classes, it is far from being a &quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;superclass&quot; quantity. It &quot;moderates&quot; but 
is far from &quot;reconciling&quot;. It &quot;moderates&quot; by depriving the enslaved and exploited of the 
means and weapons of battle, by
stupefying them with a number of ideological influences, by preserving the &quot;order&quot; which is 
the condition of the process of exploitation.<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">3)</a></sup> The very existence of the state is an 
expression of the complete
irreconcilability of classes. Consequently at the basis of the rise of the state lies the 
process of the formation of classes. The process of the formation of classes means, however, 
the conversion of the process of
production and reproduction into the process of production and reproduction of the surplus 
product alienated by the ruling class. This is the economic foundation for the appearance and 
consequent functioning of the
state. The economic conditions of production, which are simultaneously the process of 
exploitation, need &quot;order&quot;, that is an objective, forcible guarantee. Therefore economic 
exploitation is supplemented by political
oppression, the economic &quot;relation of mastery-enslavement&quot; (&quot;Herrschafts und 
Knechtschaftsverhältnis,&quot; Marx) is fixed in functions, embracing the whole of society in their organs of political organisation, the state.
Economics engender politics, which is itself only &quot;concentrated economics&quot; (Lenin), &quot;ökonomische Potenz&quot; (Engels). Class society is a relative and deeply contradictory unity. 
Therefore its categories also bear the seal
of this. Hence the original character of the dialectic of society and the state. The state is 
at the same time the product of society and its political expression. But this expression can 
only be a class one. The category of
oppression, corresponding to the category of exploitation, presupposes a relation between the 
social subject of oppression (i.e.
exploitation) and its object. In such a case the whole of society
is an exploiting society. The state is an utterly class machine
of oppression, for it is the dominant class &quot;constituted as state
power&quot;. So therefore here there can be no question of social
&quot;solidarity&quot;, of a really super-class force, of the representative
of the &quot;general&quot; interest, &quot; general &quot; will of the so-called
&quot;whole&quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">4)</a></sup> But by state two things are often meant which do
not overlap. For by state is meant only the organised subject
of oppression, i.e. the organisation of the ruling class embracing
the whole of society, having as its object the exploited class, but
looked at without including that object (just as by trust is usually
meant the &quot;apparatus&quot; of the trust with its direction, but without
the workers who are the object of the squeezing out of surplus
value), for by state is meant the whole of society in its state
political form, i.e. the organisation of the ruling class as subject,
with the inclusion of all its &quot;citizens&quot;, including also the politi
cally oppressed, economically exploited classes (i.e. class). How
ever, even in the last case we can speak only of a class state, for
the inclusion of all classes in a so-called state does not contradict
one scrap its class-oppressing function, which infers a &quot;normal&quot;
course of the process of exploitation. For in the given case the
exploited class is only introduced as object. It is not a participator in the &quot;machine&quot; of oppression. Just as all society is
exploiting, as a type, although its oppressed classes are only the
objects of exploitation, and the state is an organisation of enslavement, though, in the given conception, it not only includes the
enslavers but also the object of enslavement. &quot;From the political
point of view the state and the structure of society are not two
separate things: the state is the structure of society&quot;,<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">5)</a></sup> but
&quot;political power is precisely the official expression of the antagonism of classes in civic society&quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">6)</a></sup> We may also look at the
state as the organisation of the ruling class in the narrow sense of
the word, as the &quot;machine&quot; of oppression without including the
object of that oppression just as Marx looked at it in his mature
works. The &quot;general utility functions&quot; of state power (railroad
construction, fight against infectious diseases, etc.) are far from
being the expression of &quot;solidarity&quot; but are the essential condition of the &quot;normal&quot; course of exploitation. &quot;Social legislation&quot; generally represents 
the same sort of estimation of forces as a concession to workers during a strike, with a 
transference of the process of exploitation to
a higher stage. Here, therefore, there is never a question of the changing of the class essence 
of the state, as such, and of the class significance of its functions.</P>

<P>It is not difficult to see this upon an analysis of the function of the state in any historical 
type, including the analysis of the modern capitalist state. The laws passed (the legislative 
function) protect and assist in equal
directions the enlarged reproduction of capitalist relations (the interests of property, of the 
balance of trade, of accumulation; the interests of the guaranteeing of power, the suppression 
and corresponding education of
the oppressed classes; the interests of &quot;defence&quot; and attack against competitors, etc.). &quot;The protection of personal security and social order&quot; (police, gendarmerie, army), &quot;the 
protection of inherited and acquired rights&quot; (justice), the cultural functions (education, hygiene, etc.) and the state church, the 
struggle against competing states, all this in essence has a clearly expressed class character, 
being covered by the specific ideology of &quot;law&quot; as the more or less ideal standards of human communion. The machinery of oppression, 
possessing its own material technique (the means of physical destruction, punishment and fear) and powerful organisations
furnished with this technique (the army, police, courts, etc.) which form parts of the 
universal organisation of the ruling class embracing all society-this machinery appears under 
the pseudonym of the totality of legal
standards, of an ideal complex functioning by force of its own inner logic and conviction. Such 
fetishism of state power and the specific &quot;judicial cretinism&quot; corresponding to it, which 
looks at law as a self-sufficient
social substance, moving exclusively by the logic of its inner, immanent laws, congeals into 
the system of &quot;pure law&quot;. All this mysticism is dissipated, however, once we expose the 
following fundamental facts and
connections.</P>

<P>1. States correspond in their types to social formations. The economic structure of society determines the type of state power and its structure.</P>

<P>2. The dominant class economically is, à la longue, the class constituted as the state power, 
i.e. which is politically dominant.</P>

<P>3. The chief function of state power is the guaranteeing of the process of exploitation.</P>

<P>4. It is different from all other organisations of the dominant class in that the state is all embracing, it is the most general organisation, representing the interests of the dominant class as a whole <sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">7)</a></sup> and
monopolising the material means of violence and the chief means of spiritual enslavement.</P>

<P>5. The rules of state organisation, i.e. the generally obligatory standards of behaviour, 
behind which stands the whole apparatus of compulsion, protect and facilitate the reproduction of the process
of exploitation of that concretely historical type, which corresponds to the given mode of 
production and, consequently, to the given type of state.</P>

<P>The ideologues of the bourgeoisie, insofar as they are compelled to recognise scraps of Marxism 
in the structures of the &quot;Machttheorie&quot; (the theory of social force, of rule, subjection, 
etc.) generally
extract the revolutionary sting from the Marxian theory, extinguishing the idea of class, 
blunting the chief function of intermediary of the process of exploitation into numerous &quot;general utility&quot;
functions, reducing the exploiting and oppressor rôle of the state to its historical sources 
and treating contemporary manifestations of this type only as &quot;excesses&quot; and &quot;abuses&quot;. The
consistently
developed Marxist theory is anathema to them, for, as one of the high priests of bourgeois 
political science, G. Jellinek, frankly wrote: &quot;The practical consequences of the force 
theory lie not in the
foundation (Begründung) but the destruction (Zerstörung) of the state;&quot; &quot;it paves the way to 
the permanent revolution.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">8)</a></sup></P>

<P>The most important tendency in modern bourgeois state science, the school of Herr Kelsen, 
starts out methodologically from the teleological standardised conception of law and from a 
purely
ideological treatment of the state, adjusted to the system of its standards. Speaking 
generally, the whole fashionable doctrine of the &quot;aim in law&quot;, and the &quot;aim in the state&quot;, etc., is founded on the
fact that the state in capitalist society to a certain degree 
embodies a rational origin in opposition to the irrational current of economic life. &quot;Civic 
society&quot; is anarchic and elemental. It is disconnected &quot;connection&quot;, &quot;disconnected society&quot;, as Fourier
defined it. It is not, as we have seen, &quot;a purposive subject&quot;, it is not &quot;organised 
capitalism&quot;, and cannot be this.</P>

<P>A state-political organisation is an organised quantity (though it does not organise the chief production relations of capitalism). It is a purposive subject. Its general aims are formulated 
in its laws
(the system of standards is the system of aims). Its operative function is its politics. But it 
is far from following from this that these same aims cannot be looked upon as functions, while
these
functions can be looked upon in their historical arising, development and doom as causally 
conditioned phenomena. The full bottomless error of Kelsen's system is theoretically founded on 
the fact
that the dialectic of freedom and necessity, of causality and teleology, is completely foreign to him. With him a teleological series swallows up &quot;causal necessity&quot;, whilst he himself has 
to be
explained on this very ground. Foreign to him also is the conception of the specific 
interrelations of &quot;civic society&quot; with its spontaneity, and of the capitalist state, the 
range of whose power is very
limited by this spontaneity (e.g. the capitalist state and the economic crisis), and the very 
type of which (and from the point of view of its limitedness, also) is defined (causally 
determined) by the
economic structure of capitalism.<sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">9)</a></sup> Kelsen's treatment of the state as a quantity having only an &quot;ideal&quot; existence, while the author here appeals to Marx who put the state in the 
superstructure, is
based on the confusion of ideology and superstructure. The latter conception is the broader 
one. The state is a social-political superstructure, but the &quot; material attributes &quot; (arms, the 
whole material
and technical basis of the apparatus of compulsion, prisons, etc.) and the human organisation 
(army, bureaucracy) can only be declared to be phenomena with &quot;merely an ideal existence&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#10" name="10b">10)</a></sup> 
from an
obviously stupid standpoint. Kelsen's criticism of Marxism in other directions is impossibly 
feeble (although in his person we have one of the most eminent representatives of modern 
bourgeois
political science), &quot;Of course,&quot; he declares, &quot;the modern state can be
looked upon as a means for (Mittel zum Zweck) the economic exploitation of one class by 
another.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#11" name="11b">11)</a></sup> But according to Kelsen this is not the root of the matter, for: (<I>a</I>) there have 
been states in which
it was impossible to speak of economic exploitation as being essential to their content; (<I>b</I>) 
economic exploitation &quot;is in no wise (keineswegs) the only aim of the modern state&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#12" name="12b">12)</a></sup>; (<I>c</I>) 
but in the first
place a state organisation is <I>conceivable</I> (denkbar, our emphasis, N.B.) having as its object 
the prevention (Verhinderung) of economic exploitation; (<I>d</I>) this is expressed in the fact that 
the modern
state which was not in a position to abolish exploitation by means of social legislation, 
nevertheless showed in this legislation a tendency &quot;towards the liquidation (Aufhebung) of 
class opposition&quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#13" name="13b">13)</a></sup></P>

<P>In this regard it is worth mentioning that (<I>ad a</I>) there were no such states à la longue; (<I>ad 
b</I>) it is impossible to confuse the &quot;only&quot; &quot;aim&quot; (it would be more accurate to say 
function), with the main &quot;aim&quot; to which the others are subordinated. The fact is that the main function is the 
guaranteeing of the process of exploitation, but this function is in its turn accompanied by 
others which have a
derivative importance; (<I>ad c</I>) the &quot;conceivable&quot; state of Kelsen is self-contradictory and 
inconceivable, if we take as premise the class nature of the state, except for the proletarian dictatorship which
is a state and riot a state at the same time, as we shall see below. But Kelsen is here in fact 
not speaking of proletarian dictatorship; (<I>ad d</I>) the reference to the modern bourgeois state 
is far from
convincing; this state is a long way from manifesting these tendencies of which Herr Kelsen 
speaks. His statements in fact can only rest either on the recognition of the &quot;tendency&quot; 
towards a
softening of the class struggle in general, which is decisively refuted by the facts, or on a 
non-class treatment of the state. It is aimed at showing the latest practice of the 
state.However, this practice
also is fundamentally contradictory to his theory which is founded on facts from the period 
when the bourgeoisie manoeuvred and retreated (he turned this circumstance into a matter of 
principle, as
being the &quot;higher justice&quot; of the &quot;neutral&quot; and &quot;super-class&quot; state). Consequently facts 
have reduced the whole theory of Kelsen to nothing. O. Spann in 
an essentially less interesting but more open fashion formulates the shabby basis of all 
idealist arguments against the Marxian theory of the state by connecting them with an &quot;argumentation&quot;
against the materialist conception of history, which he reproaches for a &quot;lack of true 
idealism&quot;. &quot; So we see in the extremely pure working out of a preferential position for 
action, above all economic
action, in regard to all spiritual things, which is characteristic of Marx's historical 
materialism, a legitimate mode of thought which is at bottom barbarous, since it is hostile to the spirit and to culture.
Historical materialism is a system which devalues the innermost noble creations of culture, 
science, art, religion, morality, by seeing them as reflexes or 'superstructures' of purely 
economic processes
of development.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#14" name="14b">14)</a></sup> The causal explanation of a phenomenon, the discovery of its social 
genesis, means, according to this strange logic, its devaluation. To declare war on religious 
mediævalism is to
declare oneself a barbarian. From this standpoint the acceptance of the Darwinian theory means to start howling like a wolf. However, &quot;the irony of history&quot;leads one to quite different 
facts and
logical conclusions.</P>

<P>So state organisation strengthens a definite, historically derived, exploiting mode of 
production, being, according to its type, the expression of a specific, historical, social and economic structure. All
the chief means of physical violence and spiritual enslavement are accumulated in the state 
organisation. The transition to a new economic formation, therefore, cannot take place without
the
overthrow of the ruling class, and consequently also, without the partial, and, during a 
proletarian revolution, the complete destruction of its state organisation. Victory over a 
class adversary implies
the disorganisation of his main forces. Thus the social revolution is bound to have its 
political side. This most acute class struggle, passing over into civil war, has its 
fundamental objective conflict
between the growth of productive forces and the form of productive relations, a conflict of 
which the decisive clash of classes is the subjective expression. So it is absolutely 
impossible to divorce the
acute struggle from its catastrophic objective conditions in the economy of society, conditions 
which
determine this struggle. Kelsen attacks the Marxian doctrine here also. His argument is as 
follows. The development of the &quot; basis&quot; (Unterbau) is a continuous evolutionary process, &quot;ein Kontinuum&quot;. Every change is &quot;a chain of infinitely small 'revolutions', each change is such a 'revolution'.<sup class="anote"><a href="#15" name="15b">15)</a></sup> Therefore there can only be revolution in the sphere of ideology, or, in 
other words, 'revolution' is
a conception which can only be constituted in the sphere of standard, ethical and political or juridical analysis.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#16" name="16b">16)</a></sup> It is not hard to expose the sophism of the small &quot; revolutions &quot;. Of
course, the
contradiction between continuity and interruption is immanent in the whole process of 
development and every change is a change of a qualitative character. But there are &quot;leaps&quot; 
and &quot;leaps&quot;.
There is &quot;quality&quot; and &quot;quality&quot;. And it is this problem of quality and quality itself 
which entirely escapes Herr Kelsen. Capitalist society develops by contradictions all the time. 
It even passes
through important phases of these changes (industrial capitalism, imperialism). But these 
changes are not of the same qualitative kind as the transition from capitalism to socialism. In 
the latter case
the leap is one of another type which is immeasurably more &quot;one of principle&quot;, one passing 
beyond the structural forms of capitalism in general, and the new quality is a quality of 
absolutely
different measure. From the point of view of the capitalist system in general the new quality 
is only socialism and the leap is only the proletarian revolution. To put changes inside the 
capitalist system
on one level with the liquidation of that system and the transition to socialism means not to 
see and not to understand the chief laws of the process. It is just because of this that it is impossible to
dissolve revolution in evolution and to change the new form of the whole social being for the 
small cash of molecular changes of the usual evolutional type. The second chief mistake lies in 
the
mechanical divorce from one another of the different aspects of vitally active society. The 
historical process is a contradictory but single process of the reproduction of social life. 
&quot;Basis&quot; and &quot;superstructure&quot; go through their vital circuit in a state of constant reciprocity and
&quot;submitting&quot; to the single law of social development of the whole, which is also the determining law of the development of the basis. Therefore the very 
possibility that one part of social being is capable of causal examination and the other of 
standard and
teleological examination (only!) is ruled out beforehand. It is impossible to drag revolution, as the victorious struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, as a &quot;leap&quot;, out of 
the whole social
and historical context. It is an &quot;element&quot; in the reproduction of social life, a reproduction 
only possible in its new historical and economic form. The fetters of the old productive 
relations must be
broken (this is the basis and not &quot;ideology&quot;, for the information of Herr Kelsen), the 
condition of which is the destruction of the state machine of the bourgeoisie. Here Marx 
emphasises just that
destructive <sup class="anote"><a href="#17" name="17b">17)</a></sup> process, the necessity for the proletariat &quot; to concentrate against it (the 
state machine, N.B.) all the forces of destruction &quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#18" name="18b">18)</a></sup> The question of the destruction of the 
state machine of the
bourgeoisie or its utilisation by the proletariat is far from being one of terminology. Despite 
Kelsen, it has an immense importance both practically and theoretically. Theoretically, since 
it speaks of the
peculiar law of the process, since it poses the question of the organisation of a new type of 
state (both in class content, in its organisational forms, and in the tendencies of its 
development).
Practically, since it correspondingly directs the whole strategy and tactics of the 
proletariat. And along this line runs a bloody furrow between social-democracy and communism.</P>

<P>Thus</P>

<P>1. The main tendencies in capitalist development lead to a conflict between the development of productive forces which has prepared the material prerequisites of the new society 
(concentration of
the means of production, socialisation of labour) and its capitalist husk (Hulle, Marx), a 
conflict of such intensity that this husk becomes incompatible with the further development of
productive
forces and therefore of society as a whole.</P>

<P>2. This conditions an extreme sharpening of class contradictions and tensity of class struggle. 
&quot;The more or less concealed civil war within existing society&quot; &quot;is transformed into open 
revolution&quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#19" name="19b">19)</a></sup></P>

<P>3. Concentrating all destructive forces against the state machine of the bourgeoisie, the 
proletariat violently smashes that machine.</P>

<P>4. It creates a new type of state, the dictatorship of the proletariat. The class struggle &quot;inevitably leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;.</P>

<P>5. &quot;The proletariat will use its political supremacy, to wrest, by degrees, all capital from 
the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the state, i.e. of the proletariat
organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as 
possible.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#20" name="20b">20)</a></sup></P>

<P>&quot;Between capitalist and communist society,&quot; Marx wrote in <I>The Critique of the Gotha Programme</I>, 
&quot;lies a period of revolutionary transformation from one to the other. There corresponds also 
to this a
political transition period during which the state can be nothing else than <I>the revolutionary 
dictatorship of the proletariat</I>.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#21" name="21b">21)</a></sup> We must dwell in the first place on the dictatorship of 
the proletariat from the
point of view of the definition of the state organisation as being the general class 
organisation of rule which guarantees the process of economic exploitation. It is quite clear 
that it does not come
under that definition. But this is far from implying that the state of the proletariat is 
divorced from its material economic basis. If the exploiting types of state power in all their variety of historical forms
had as their main function the enlarged reproduction of productive relations on which they were 
based and of which they were the concentrated political expression, then the dictatorship of the
proletariat has as its chief function the enlarged reproduction of new, socialist productive 
relations. If, for example, the capitalist state facilitated the eating up of pre-capitalist 
economic forms, then
the dictatorship of the proletariat, after the expropriation of the expropriators, is a means 
for the further growth of socialist forms, a powerful lever for the liquidation and 
refashioning of capitalist and
small property owning economic relations. But for the very reason that economic development in
the transition period is nothing but the final disappearance of the relics of former economic
formations and types, and so therefore of the relics of exploitation and of the material 
starting-points from which it 
arises, for this very reason the dictatorship of the proletariat bears within itself the seeds of its own dying away. So that even from the point of view of its economic function the 
dictatorship of the
proletariat is both a state and not a state. It is the last historical form of the state in 
which it finally merges and dissolves into society.,Consequently: (1) it is the organ of the 
ruling class, the
proletariat; (2) this organisation has as its economic function the enlarged reproduction of 
socialist productive relations; (3) it is the general, widest and universal organisation of 
the proletariat,
directed by the advance guard, the party; (4) it monopolises all the means of physical 
compulsion and the spiritual refashioning of men; (5) its immediate function is the 
suppression of the resistance
of the exploiters, their breaking up and liquidation; this function of decisive and merciless 
class struggle carried through to the end is, of course, the most important prerequisite for 
all that follows.
Here, consequently, we have a relation of rule. But this relation is a vanishing quantity 
insofar as in the course of the class struggle classes themselves at a definite stage of 
development disappear.
By drawing everyone into its direct organisation, the state ceases to be itself, and absorbing society into itself, itself dissolves into it without leaving a trace. Class rule over people 
is transformed into
the classless administration of things. This process of the transition to the &quot;administration
of things&quot; is conditioned by the fact that the dictatorship of the proletariat includes an 
absolutely specific
relation between economics and politics and a tendency towards the liquidation of classes.</P>

<P>In the capitalist formation elemental and anarchic &quot;civic society &quot; is only embraced by the &quot;political state&quot; and is far from merging with it and organising the main forms of its 
movement, which in
civil society are, private property, private arrangements between capitalist and worker, 
competition, irrationality, and in state organisation are, the representation of the interests of the capitalist class
as a whole, a certain rationality, but a narrow one which does not reach the foundations of &quot;civic society&quot;. Under the proletarian dictatorship the state merges more and more with 
economy. All the
chief economic levers 
are in the hands of the proletarian state. State organisation is also economic organisation. 
The administration of socialist economy is a direct function of the state in its struggle to 
overcome class
oppositions. So here we have a difference in principle in the relation between &quot;society&quot; and the &quot;state&quot;, between &quot;politics&quot; and &quot;economics&quot;, between the &quot;administration of people&quot; 
and the &quot;administration of things&quot;. In such conditions the development of productive forces and the 
victorious course of the class struggle systematically prepare the transition to the swallowing 
up of the
political functions of the state in administrative and economic functions, i.e. the transition to classless and stateless communist society. In this way, therefore, the dictatorship of the 
proletariat in all its
main functions and tendencies of development can in no way march parallel with other types of 
state power, for, historically understood, it has already gone outside the limits of the state
as such.
Therefore Kelsen's attempts to refute the oppressive, exploiting character of the capitalist 
state by the example of proletarian dictatorship which destroys exploitation, are truly 
pitiful.<sup class="anote"><a href="#22" name="22b">22)</a></sup> Nor is the
author's effort to construct a fatal contradiction between Marx's economic doctrine and his 
theory of proletarian dictatorship any more successful. Kelsen here advances the following kind 
of
argument: (<I>a</I>) Marx's economic theory which has overcome the economic naïveté of Proudhon and 
the anarchists, leads to a view of communist economy as a centralised planned system which calls
for compulsion, while at the same time a &quot;clearly expressed anarchist ideal&quot; is put forward 
in the political sphere; (<I>b</I>) there is not and cannot be any administration of things which is 
not also an
administration of persons; (<I>c</I>) the relation of different human groupings to the problems of 
religion, art and &quot;above all to erotic problems&quot; will not only be shown in different points 
of view but also in
vast conflicts calling for the interference of state power. Against this the following 
counter-arguments must be advanced: to (<I>a</I>) &quot;stateless&quot; and &quot;anarchist&quot; are only 
philosophically identical. The &quot;anarchist ideal&quot; in fact rejects centralisation. Stateless centralisation will be possible and 
historically inevitable, for the growth of productive forces leads
to centralisation. The complex co-operation of men is quite conceivable without compulsion (an
orchestra). The process of overcoming class oppositions, of &quot;servile hierarchy&quot; (Marx) and of 
the
dying away of the state will create a self-discipline which little by little will not only push 
out the relics of class compulsion but also of authoritarianism in general. The centralisation of social functions
is then only a state when it is given with a class characteristic; to (<I>b</I>) by administration of 
persons is meant the process of commanding them administratively, that is, of converting them into 
objects, into simple fulfillers of
commands, which presupposes a hierarchy of persons, compulsion, submission. Insofar as these 
elements disappear the administration of persons in the sense of administrative command over 
them
disappears also. Things also remain as objects, the means of production, the instruments of 
labour (the doctor does not administer the sick when he gives a prescription, the direction of an orchestra is
not administration in the administrative com
mand sense of the word); to (<I>c</I>) religion in communist society disappears altogether, for, 
since it is the reflection of a divided world and the projection into &quot;heaven&quot; of the &quot;earthly&quot; categories of
the state, of subjection, it loses any basis for existence.
As for &quot;erotic problems&quot; (here we see a little Freudian-Viennese &quot;local colour&quot; in Kelsen), 
they will certainly not come up for solution in any administrative manner. Indeed to imagine 
eroticism as a
basis for state power in any way at all is to confess oneself completely ignorant of real 
historical processes.</P>

<P>Marx and Engels also approached the problem of the dying away of the state from the aspect of 
an analysis of the state as
a parasitic growth on the social body. The sharper the class contradictions, the stronger the 
centrifugal forces splitting the relative unity of society, the larger is the state apparatus 
(the
army, civil service, etc.), the more immense are the non-productive expenses on it, the real 
faux frais of exploiting social formations. The state is transformed into a force which stands above society,
divided off from it, growing disproportionately even from the point of view of its own 
functions.</P>

<P>This peculiar hypertrophy		of the state apparatus and its
extreme bureaucratisation,<sup class="anote"><a href="#23" name="23b">23)</a></sup> this existence over society and those forces standing outside 
society, these monstrous nonproductive expenses, which arise out of the features of a specific
(exploiting)
social formation and are multiplied by the growth of. its inner contradictions, are destroyed 
in the first place, and in this destruction are already to be found the germs of the 
surmounting of the state.</P>

<P>It is the cri de mode at present to declare the ultimate aim of communism, as treated by Marx, to be an anarchistic ideal. If formerly Marx's virile theory, revolutionary from top to bottom, 
was put on a
level with K. Rodbertus's Prussian landlord socialism and the national-&quot;labour&quot;, semi-Bismarckian socialism of F. Lassalle, it is to-day frequently bracketed with the systems 
of Bismarck, Kropotkin,
etc. Marx does in fact speak of anarchy in one place, in declaring that &quot;all socialists 
understand by anarchy, the ultimate aim of the proletarian movement...&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#24" name="24b">24)</a></sup> But one 
circumstance fundamentally
distinguishes Marx's theory - it is a scientific theory. It tackles all problems from the point 
of view of development, of history, and not abstractly. So with Marx it is a question of the 
dictatorship of the
proletariat as a transitional historical phase of development to communism and of different 
stages of the movement of society towards a stateless communist commune. This stateless 
(anarchic in this
sense) society differs however in the highest degree from the federation of small communes of 
semi-handicraft character which anarchism has in mind and whose social genesis is very far from 
the
deeply fundamental sections of the industrial proletariat. Marxism, on the other hand, has 
nothing in common with its pitiful social-fascist caricature which goes back ideologically to 
Lassalle, growing
with all its shoots into the ideology of the fascist &quot;national&quot;, &quot;caste&quot; and &quot;corporative&quot; state, with the proletariat completely enslaved to capital and its terrorist dictatorship, 
offered up under the
pseudonym of the &quot;nation&quot; and the &quot;whole&quot;, with an enormous number of various &quot;simulacra&quot; 
(the demagogic aspect of fascism) and &quot;arcana dominationis&quot;.</P>

<P>The dictatorship of the proletariat as the autocracy of the working-class is simultaneously an inner class proletarian democracy, in opposition to bourgeois democracy, which, founded on capitalist property, 
exploitation and, consequently, on deep economic inequality, creates a whole system of 
democratic simulacra, i.e.
of deceptive and disguised institutions of a formal juridical equality for all. Really this is a fiction, for economic inequality makes formal legal equality unrealisable. But the reality of 
these fictions is in
their preventive and disguised functions which are very real. Even in the most democratic 
systems, which to-day largely belong to the historic past, the inner mechanism of state power 
fully
guarantees the autocracy, i.e. the dictatorship, of the bourgeoisie, which has been analysed 
even by certain bourgeois authorities on the state, such as R. Michels,<sup class="anote"><a href="#25" name="25b">25)</a></sup> Ostrogorsky<sup class="anote"><a href="#26" name="26b">26)</a></sup> and 
others. The
mechanism of parties, of small &quot;cabinets&quot;, &quot;caucuses&quot; (in the U.S.A.), of &quot;higher 
instances&quot; behind the scenes, with the whole system of &quot;arcana imperil&quot;, is the real 
machine, which, despite its
determining importance and rôle in actual life, plays a very small part in its quality of 
object for the bourgeois theory of state law which analyses the system of numerous simulacra in 
the first place
from the formally juridical point of view. The dictatorship of the proletariat has no need of 
such a system of fictions. It openly declares its class character and its functions which find expression in the
consciousness of bourgeois political scientists as a recognition of the anti-democratic (but 
not anti-bourgeois, not proletarian democratic) character of proletarian dictatorship.</P>

<P class="quote">The dictatorship of the proletariat [declares, for instance, Hans Gmelin,]<sup class="anote"><a href="#27" name="27b">27)</a></sup> is a form of 
government (Regierunsform), according to which state power, in opposition to democracy, should not proceed
from the whole people, but only from the classes which live by manual labour. Although the 
popular masses participating in state power are very numerous, nevertheless the dictatorship of 
the
proletariat must be put on a level with aristocracies and oligarchies, since here also it is a
question of the rôle of one class.</P>

<P>Marx exposed the real meaning of the theory of the &quot;popular&quot;, &quot;free&quot; state, which is 
defended by vulgar democracy, in a merciless scientific analysis. On the other hand, the 
dictatorship of the
proletariat, since it is the autocracy of the proletariat, really 
guarantees democracy to it, educating and refashioning both the proletariat itself, and its 
allies, for it &quot;expropriates the expropriators &quot;and builds socialism, raises the material and 
cultural level of life of the toilers by
continually developing all their inner forces and potentialities and bringing nearer the 
destruction of the gap between mental and physical labour.<sup class="anote"><a href="#28" name="28b">28)</a></sup> It is only here that the &quot;people&quot; which in Plato's aristocratic state was
treated as &delta;&eta;&sigmaf;&#943;&omicron;&upsilon; &pi;&omicron;&iota;&chi;&#943;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;
&kappa;&alpha;&#943; &pi;&omicron;&lambda;&upsilon;&chi;&epsilon;&phi;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon; (a motley and many-headed beast) shows itself, in 
the course of its historical refashioning, as the real creator and organiser of the new society 
which marks the transition &quot;from the pre-history of man to his real history&quot;. With Marx, therefore, (1) there is a peculiar dialectic of 
dictatorship and democracy; (2) democracy itself is not treated in its extrahistorical abstraction
whereby it is reduced to nothing, but in its historical, concrete, class particular form, which 
(3) in its turn is analysed from the point of view of the historical change in the means of 
production and the types of state
power. Thus the dictatorship of the proletariat is a new, higher type of democracy, and is, 
moreover, such a type as by developing, finally destroys any kind of state power, that is to 
say, negates itself.</P>

<P>Dictatorship in general, and the dictatorship of the proletariat in particular, besides the autocracy of a class, implies a special factor of disconnection even in its own laws. In 
accordance with the &quot;dictates of the moment&quot;
it lays down what must be the suitable actions from the standpoint of its tasks. It <I>decides</I>, 
above all.<sup class="anote"><a href="#29" name="29b">29)</a></sup> This bareness of function, and heightened &quot;freedom of action&quot;, this twofold 
purpose, are particularly characteristic
of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which comes forward with the visor of history thrown 
open. Bringing the whole administration of &quot;national economy&quot; into its apparatus, enriching 
and varying to the greatest
possible extent its tasks, placing itself on a foundation of socialist economy of 
ever-increasing planned character, the dictatorship of the proletariat rationalises to the 
highest degree the vital process of society as a whole.
The class struggle of the proletariat organised as the state power assumes a variety of forms, impregnating every sphere of social life, from technique to philosophy. This process of the 
transformation of society from a
fractional-elemental condition into a rationalised and organised
one, this conversion of subjectless society into society the subject, fundamentally changes the 
very type of law of social development. The relation between the causal and teleological 
sequence is changed. This does not
mean that objective law and the objective laws of development disappear. But it does mean that
they lose their character of a blind external force standing above man and opposing his 
actions. Developed communism is
the conditional limit of development, on the law of which Marx wrote as follows:</P>

<P class="quote">Just as the savage must wrestle with nature, in order to satisfy his wants, in order to 
maintain his life and reproduce it, so civilised man
has to do it, and he must do it in all forms of society and under all possible modes of 
production. With his development the realm of natural necessity expands, because his wants 
increase; but at the same time the forces
of production increase, by which these wants are satisfied. The freedom in this field cannot 
consist of anything
else but of the fact that socialised man, the associated producers, regulate their interchange
with nature rationally, bring it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by 
some blind power; that they
accomplish their task with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most adequate 
to their human
nature and most worthy of it. But it always remains a realm of necessity. Beyond it begins that 
development of human power, which is its own end, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can
flourish only upon that realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the working day is 
its fundamental premise.... In fact, the realm of freedom does not commence until the point 
is passed where labour under the
compulsion of necessity and of external utility is required. In the very nature of things it 
lies beyond the sphere of material production in the strict meaning of the term.<sup class="anote"><a href="#30" name="30b">30)</a></sup></P>

<P>In other words the transition from capitalism to socialism is far from implying entry into the realm of pure chance or of pure &quot;free will&quot; on a social scale (indeterminism). It is far from 
implying the liquidation of the
category of necessity, i.e. of objective law, which remains. The development of material 
production will always be subject to objective laws, like everything else on earth. But the 
destruction of anarchy in production and
of irrationality in the productive process, i.e. the organisation of socialist production, its planned nature, its rational character (&quot;general control&quot;)destroy the form of &quot;blind&quot; law, of law as a &quot;blind force&quot; ruling 
over men, external to them. Consequently, necessity here
appears as freedom (&quot; Freedom is the recognition of necessity&quot;),the causal connection finds 
its direct teleological expression, ever more and more
coinciding in its &quot;volume&quot;. So, for example, in the economic plan, which is a system of lines of action (a system of standards, a teleological
system), this causal necessity finds its direct expression. If we renounce &quot;necessity&quot;and 
&quot;objective law&quot; altogether, there instead of Marxism we
get pure subjectivism and voluntarism. If we renounce the destruction of the &quot;blindness&quot; in 
law, the new interrelation between the causal and
teleological sequence, then we get a mechanical transplantation of the categories of capitalism 
into socialism, that is to say, a bourgeois, liberal
caricature of Marxism, utterly anti-dialectical, anti-historical. Therefore in the economic 
sphere, the product under socialism: ceases to be a
commodity, the category of value ceases to exist, the blind &quot;law of value&quot; is destroyed, 
but there remains, in another relationship, of course (both
qualitative and quantitative), the necessity of the distribution of social labour according to the, different spheres of social production. The plan,
therefore, has its objective basis. In becoming more and more a scientific plan, it is more and 
more the expression of recognised necessity, which is
freedom. But science itself would be objectless if there were no objective laws, since science
has as its object precisely their analysis and theoretical
expression, which becomes a direct instrument of practical action.</P>

<P>As we have seen, the state can be treated as an apparatus of state power and as society in its state form, i.e. with the inclusion and exclusion of the
object of its action. The latter treatment can be applied particularly in regard to the 
dictatorship of the, proletariat because (<I>a</I>) the dictatorship of the
proletariat does not' stand above society; (<I>b</I>) because economics here merge with ' politics; 
(<I>c</I>) politics (including economics) are rapidly
objectivised on an immense scale as a current of the social and historical  (and in the first 
place economic) process. Therefore the phases of
development of the dictatorship of the proletariat are the 
phases of development of society as a whole towards communism through the class struggle.</P>

<P>The dictatorship of the proletariat, which includes elements of direct class struggle, both 
bloody and bloodless; of struggle and leadership over its
allies, of the refashioning of technique, economy, people and their consciousness; their 
education, organisation, etc., means in the sphere of
economics a constant growth of socialist, planned economy. From the point of view of relations between industry and agriculture it forces on the
process of overcoming the opposition between town and country, the destruction of &quot;the 
stupidity of village life&quot;, the outliving of property
relations on the land. The development of the forces of production, emancipated by the 
revolution, which inevitably multiplies the technical and
economic power of industry, cannot be reconciled with the backward form of production 
relationships in agriculture, a form which chemically
isolates ever newer and newer elements of capitalism. It therefore holds up the whole 
development, since expanded industry creates such a demand
for agricultural production as can be satisfied only by decisive changes in agriculture. Marx 
expressed this in an unusually sharp form in his letter to
Engels of the 14th August, 1852: &quot;The more I busy myself with this muck (he is referring to 
Proudhon. N.B.), the more I am convinced that a reform
in agriculture, and consequently in the property abomination founded on it, is the alpha and 
omega of the coming revolution. Without it father
Malthus will be right.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#31" name="31b">31)</a></sup></P>

<P>The first phase of communism, which still bears the &quot;birth marks&quot; of the old society, is 
characterised by: (<I>a</I>) an incomplete development of
productive forces; (<I>b</I>) the non-destruction as yet of the division between physical and mental 
labour; (<I>c</I>)
distribution, not according to need but according to labour (which is inevitable at the given 
stage of development of productive forces); (<I>d</I>) the
preservation of the relics of bourgeois law (an
equal share of the product for an equal quantity of labour when there is inequality of ability
and strength is an expression of inequality); (<I>e</I>) relics
of hierarchy, subjection, the state. The higher phase of communist society which arises 
historically on the basis of the further growth of productive forces, goes outsid these limits.</P>

<P class="quote">In the higher phase of communist society, after the tyrannical;
subordination of individuals, according to the division of labour, and and thereby also the 
distinction between mental and physical labour,
has disappeared, after labour has become not merely a means to live
but is in itself the first necessity of living, after the forces of production have also increased and all the springs of co-operative wealth are
flowing more freely together with the all-round development of the
individual, then and then only can the narrow bourgeois horizon of
rights be left far behind and society will inscribe on its banner -
&quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his
needs.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#32" name="32b">32)</a></sup></P>

<P>The higher phase of communism is thus characterised by: (<I>a</I>) an exceptionally large development of the forces of production; (<I>b</I>) a vital and creative, absolutely free form of labour; (<I>c</I>) 
the destruction of the division of
labour, i.e. of the eternal, &quot;professions&quot; and in particular of the opposition between 
mental, and physical labour; (<I>d</I>) the disappearance of all relics of class; division, of &quot;servile hierarchy&quot; (Marx), of subjection; (<I>e</I>) distribution according to needs as every kind of deficiency in products so far as needs are 
concerned passes away; (<I>f</I>) the destruction, (dying away) of the last relics of law and the 
state.</P>

<P>The deepest distinction between the Marxian statement of the problem and that of &quot;all 
systems of the future&quot; lies in its scientific and historical approach, in its analysis of the 
real tendencies of objective historical
dialectics. With Marx there is no question, of any &quot;scheme&quot; of a rationally constructed &quot;ideal society&quot;. He has a very stern attitude towards those splendid fantasies and 
sentimental ideologies which are fabricated out
of illusory images.&quot; In discovering the laws of motion of capitalist society, Marx made vast 
historical forecasts, scientific forecasts, he foretold the inevitable doom of capitalism and 
the dictatorship of the proletariat on
the basis of his analysis of the tendencies of capitalist development, and having given on this 
ground the chief features of the coming epoch, he sketched its inevitable stages of 
development, its fundamental forms in their
historical tendency. There can therefore be nothing more commonplace than Sombart's definition
that &quot;socialism is practical social rationalism with anti-chrematistic tendencies&quot;, with its 
following subdivision into two further &quot;chief groups&quot; of socialism:</P>

<P class="quote">(1) Organic, morphological, tectonic, concrete, graphic, hierarchical, national, state 
socialism, whose representatives... are Plato, Campanella, Fichte, Saint-Simon, Rodbertus, 
and to a certain degree Fourier and Weitling
also;</P>

<P class="quote">(2) Mechanical, amorphous, commonplace, abstract, invented, equalitarian, international, social socialism... to which in the first place Marx's socialism belongs.<sup class="anote"><a href="#33" name="33b">33)</a></sup></P>

<P>The general definition of socialism given here is not only narrow but also wretchedly untrue, 
since it has nothing to say about the destruction of the process of exploitation, classes, etc. 
The demarcation into two groups
does bring in certain real elements (state and socialised, nationalism and internationalism, 
etc.), but it mixes up absolutely different kinds of things and in important features is only a 
vulgar caricature of Marxism. The main
point-historical dialectic-is omitted here. The distinction possessed by Marxist scientific 
communism as against all the &quot;systems&quot; of Utopian socialism, here disappears. Sombart &quot;does 
not need&quot; to understand the
scientific forecast made by Marx, a forecast upon which the practice of the communist movement is based. Herr Kelsen, on the other hand, supposes socialism to be a &quot;political theory&quot;, i.e. 
a system of standards put
forward on a basis of &quot;ethical and political postulates&quot;, whilst Marxism &quot;being a political 
theory, assumes a mask of 'scientific and causal investigation'&quot;, and that is all.<sup class="anote"><a href="#34" name="34b">34)</a></sup> There 
is not, in all such &quot;critical&quot; arguments, a grain of comprehension of the dialectic of causality and teleology, of necessity 
and freedom, of theory and practice, etc. &quot;Ethical&quot; socialism is unproved, since there are 
various &quot;ethical systems&quot;, various
standards of behaviour, various aims and orientations each with a sharply defined class 
character. Here, being has completely determined consciousness, and to &quot;prove&quot;, for example, 
the &quot;desirability&quot; of socialism from
the point of view of the capitalist is stupid. However, a scientific analysis of capitalist 
society gives results which run in the same direction as the main orientation of the
proletariat. This in turn is explained by the objective situation of the proletariat in 
capitalist society. But it is just this circumstance which makes theoretical analysis a weapon
of practical activity,
which in the communist movement blends theory with practice, converting this practice into 
scientific practice. From this point of view the party of scientific communism is the only 
party at all able to
practise scientific politics, and thanks to this circumstance the birth-pangs of a new, 
socialist society are curtailed. The class movement of the proletariat obtains an absolutely 
exceptional theoretical
backing. The theory of scientific communism which is the highest product of the self-consciousness of the proletariat, raises it to a level on which it recognises its historical 
rôle as a whole, as a
subversive revolutionary force and creator of a new society, the organiser of the proletarian 
dictatorship, which liquidates itself by transformation into classless communist society.</P>

<P>If we now take Marx's theory as a whole, the vast edifice which begins with the theory of 
knowledge, the general laws of materialist dialectic, and ends with the doctrine of the 
transition period to
communism, then it is not difficult to come to the conclusion that the world has never known 
such a scientific philosophical synthesis. The professional savants of the bourgeoisie who have 
now lost
their heads at the thunder of the avalanches of history, have made many assaults on Marx, 
thinking to damage the practical side of his universal activity by carving this giant of genius 
into a learned
man on the one hand and a revolutionary on the other. But in this they have simply shown the 
poverty and limitations of doctrinaires.</P>

<P>Marx showed by his whole life and activity that he was a  great man of learning precisely 
because he was a great revolutionary. And he was a great revolutionary because he was a a great 
man of
learning. His whole monumental theory is verified by unprecedented historical practice. The 
practical criterion of truth and correspondence with reality in regard to this virile, compact, 
grand theory, is
applied on the scale of a world. revolution. What teaching, what conception, what doctrine; 
what &quot;guide to action&quot; ever knew such quantities, such qualities? 
Marx has given us an all-powerful weapon. This universal genius who has built up a 
creative synthesis of all the conquests of thought has also given us an unprecedented synthesis 
of theory
and practice. And if the creator of dialectical materialism, of the materialist conception of 
history, the creator of the <I>Communist Manifesto</I> and of <I>Capital</I> was also the organiser and 
leader of the First
International, a leader and sage, a first-class strategist and tactician of revolutionary 
struggle, then his doctrine, enriched and developed by his glorious successors, is also a 
weapon of revolution, of
the destruction of the old and the building of the new.</P>

<P>After the death of Marx, who saw only the first germs of monopolist capitalism, these germs 
grew, creating a whole new stage in the development of capital, its last, imperialist stage. It 
brought all the
contradictions of capitalism to an extreme point. The most catastrophic epoch of all began, the 
epoch of imperialist wars and proletarian revolutions. This epoch caused a further development and inner
enrichment of Marxism, its conversion into Marxism-Leninism. Lenin, on the basis of a great 
scientific work, of the experience of great historical events, on the basis of the practice of
the revolutionary
movement and of immense class battles, on the basis of the proletarian revolution in Russia and 
of mass movements in the home countries and colonies of all lands, created a new stage in the 
theory of
Marxism. His teachings on imperialism, on the dictatorship of the proletariat and Soviet power as its form, on the allies of the proletariat (the peasantry in the first place) and the 
hegemony of the
proletariat, on the rôle of the party, on the national question, the colonies, etc., were given 
such a high theoretical refashioning and brought out so much that was new, as to carry forward
the whole
theory of Marx. Revolutionary Marxism is to-day only Marxism-Leninism. After Lenin's death the part of theoretical and practical leader fell to Stalin. Stalin, on the basis of an experience
of socialist
construction unprecedented in scale, of the industrialisation of and immense revolution in 
agriculture, together with the &quot;destruction of the property monstrosity&quot; in land, on the 
basis of a sharp class
struggle against the relics of
the capitalist classes, made a whole series of fresh theoretical generalisations which are 
to-day a force directing the complex practical work of the party. Marx's doctrine has grown in
both its content
and its rôle in history. Millions follow this teaching which will live and develop along with 
the forward movement of the victorious fighting armies of the proletariat. In the struggle 
against the fascist
barbarians, who cast a dark and bloody shadow over the world of culture, in the struggle 
against the falsifiers of Marxism, in the struggle against degenerate and treacherous 
social-democracy, the
Communist International and its advance guard, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the 
centre of Marxist thought and Marxist practice, leads the masses to the world dictatorship of 
the
proletariat and the fraternal
world Commune of classless humanity.</P>
