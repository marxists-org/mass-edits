<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>In the harsh and terrible epoch of the catastrophic collapse of capitalism, of wars, of revolutions, of proletarian Sturm and Drang, revolutionary Marxism as it appears in its developed and enriched form as Marxism-Leninism, stands out as a system of ideas which emerges from the chaos at once powerful, energetic, destructive and creative. Even the sworn enemies of the proletariat cannot deny this, even those who see in the heroic struggle and cyclopean creative efforts of the new class as it marches to world dominion nothing but the gloomy approach of the commencement of the reign of Lucifer and who look upon the bloody suppression of the contemporary emancipation movement of the proletariat as the elementary premise for the illusory renewal of a rotten bourgeois civilisation. Marxism is, in fact, <I>the great doctrine of our time</I>. The teaching of &quot;the red doctor&quot;, as the London-philistines called the genius of the proletarian revolution, has mastered millions. It has mastered the mass and the mass has mastered it. But the revolutionary proletariat is very far from the &quot;vita contemplativa&quot;. It is the banner-bearer of the &quot;vitae activæ&quot;, of stormy and practical life. It expresses the full tension and the full liberating &quot;torment&quot; of social matter; it expresses in its victory the decisively tragic character of a vast historical struggle. It is for just this reason that Marxism has grown up as its class system of ideas. Marxism is the world outlook of the proletariat which has grown out of the practice of its struggle and, after smelting all the valuable conquests of the age in the retort of revolutionary criticism till they form a precious alloy, it emerges as the perfect practical weapon for the revolutionary re-shaping of the world. Marxism is &quot;not a dogma, but a guide to action&quot;.</P>

<P>Here before us is an unprecedented vista of masses in praxi. The whole of the really 
revolutionary movement of the century is moving under this banner, in every continent, in every 
state, throughout
every race and nation.</P>

<P>Marxism is the profoundest revolutionary teaching in the whole history of humanity. Like the 
proletarian revolution itself, it presents two aspects of a single whole: the destructive 
side, the sharp
edge of which is aimed against the whole world order of capitalism, from its economic 
foundations to its poisonous philosophical and religious reflexes<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup>; and its creative side, the 
forces of which are
directed to the construction of new socialist forms of social life and to a new, socialist 
civilisation. In the U.S.S.R., Marxism has become an ideology recognised by the state and the 
whole of its
concentrated power is a splendid weapon for the vast construction of a new society. The 
&quot;aggregate&quot;, &quot;collective&quot; worker in the U.S.S.R., that is the unification of the various labour 
powers of this
construction, is the collective &quot;philosopher&quot; who not only &quot;explains&quot;  the world, but also &quot;changes&quot; it in the most decisive fashion.</P>

<P>With its enormous mass influence and its powerful, revolutionary and transformatory character,
Marxism is in itself an original and exceptional phenomenon. Yet its opponents and class enemies
often treat it simply as a new mass religion. It is, of course, true that humanity has, at 
different stages in its development, in the person of absolutely different classes, advanced 
ideal tendencies which
have lifted themselves like great mountain ridges above the surface of social life and become 
dominant in the world of ideas over long periods of history. To these belong in the first place 
those
religious-philosophical conceptions which
have mastered the minds of millions, the so-called &quot;world religions&quot;: the religions of Egypt and Babylon, Parseeism, the religion of Jehovah, Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism, the 
teaching of
Mahomet: to these belong the modern European ideologies, in the first place the ideology of 
so-called &quot;enlightenment&quot;. The last great philosophical doctrine of the European bourgeoisie, 
Hegel's all-
embracing system, can in no way compare with them in the breadth and depth of its actual 
influence. Indeed, it never even pretended to look upon itself as being, for example, a rival 
to historically
developed Christianity. On the contrary, it declared itself to be its philosophical support. 
Marxism transcends all these limits, both from its social genesis, its logical composition and
its social
significance. At the same time it makes pretensions to exclusiveness. It is a militant 
doctrine, it is &quot;intolerant&quot; (although it assimilates critically all the really valuable 
heritage of bourgeois culture): it
looks upon itself as the only consistent continuer of all the progressive tendencies of the age 
which are being strangled by capitalism: Its sociological self-cognition is expressed in the 
formula: the
way out from capitalism is the way out from the former modes of thinking, the change of the &quot;mode of presentation&quot;. Marxism recognises its world-historical right to the ideological 
hegemony of the
centuries. And in spite of this, or rather, partly because of this, it becomes a 
world-historical mass force.</P>

<P>One of the most widespread forms of ideological class struggle against Marxism is its treatment 
as an eschatological doctrine, with all its accompaniments of chiliasm, of soteriology, of 
myth. From
this point of view the theory of the crisis of the capitalist system, of a revolutionary 
uprising, etc., is represented as the apocalyptic &quot;last things&quot; (&tau;&#940; &#941;&sigma;&chi;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;): communism, as 
the &quot;millenary
kingdom of the chiliasts&quot;; the proletariat, as the Messiah, the saviour, &Sigma;&omega;&tau;&#942;&sigmaf;: the 
forecasts of Marx, as &quot;prophesy&quot; or &quot;promises&quot;; the analysis of capitalist contradictions, as the denunciation of
the sins of the world; the transition to socialism, as its &quot;transformation&quot;, etc.<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2)</a></sup> All these 
analogies are playing with words. It is true that different types of eschatological ideologies (national-revolutionary, revolutionary and even counter-revolutionary) <sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">3)</a></sup> were connected with more or less important national and social 
movements. The &quot;heretical&quot; movements in Asia, the Judæn &quot;prophets&quot;, primitive Christianity, 
the immense
Islamic movement, the mediæval Anabaptists, the English &quot;true Levellers&quot; and a whole number 
of other movements &quot;for the faith&quot; in fact reflected deep changes in the social order. But 
this is just
what Marx's opponents did not understand. Whereas in fact what was formerly treated from the 
standpoint of sovereign religious thought is completely subject to a scientific treatment which 
can be
only historical materialist.<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">4)</a></sup> Consequently the above historical &quot;analogy&quot; must be turned 
against the theological historical conceptions which, in the religious forms of struggle that 
are historically
inevitable at definite stages of social development, overlook the material content of that 
struggle, the movement of &quot;social matter&quot; which has its class agents with historically 
adequate ideological &quot;forms of knowledge&quot;.</P>

<P>However, the general proposition which states that any ideology, any world outlook, any 
religion and any doctrine has its earthly roots, is far from being an argument for a summary, 
lifelessly empty
and abstract, extra-historical examination of these systems of ideas. On the contrary, their 
socially determined character is connected with problems of a morphological kind, problems of 
the concrete
phase of historical development, of a concrete &quot;mode of production&quot;, of a concrete &quot;mode of 
presentation&quot;, of concrete national and social class groupings, of concrete problems in a 
concrete
historical struggle. This is from the sociological aspect. The logical composition 
corresponding to its sociological equivalent permits of concrete analysis in just the same way. 
Scientific judgment is
only possible after such an analysis.</P>

<P class="indent">1. Sociologically, Marxism is the ideology of the revolutionary proletariat, of the chief 
exploited class of capitalist society, with its powerful technique, its specific historical and 
economic formation, its
immense culture in general and its scientific culture in particular, with its specific &quot;laws 
of movement&quot;, with its specific contradictions and with its specific
prospects of transition into another social and historical phase
of development. However we may praise the cyclopean struc
tures of Egypt or Assyria, the Roman roads and aqueducts,
Indian architecture, the textiles of China, not one of these
&quot;techniques&quot; of the historical formations of the past can be
in the slightest degree compared with the technique of machine
capitalism, with its steam engines, diesel-motors, high-tension
electrical machines, with the system of perfected machine-tools,
telephones, wireless, aviation, motor-transport, television or
cinema. However carefully we may analyse the development
of money economy and the germs of usurer's and trading
capital in Babylon and China, in Greece and Rome, in Carthage
and on the shores of Asia Minor, these elements can in no
way be compared with the modern world market. However
we estimate the importance of slave &quot;manufactories&quot; like the
Greek &quot;ergasteria&quot;, or the insignificant scraps of wage labour
in past historical epochs, nevertheless, and this is the main
thing, only our own period has created a specific relationship
between the owner of the means of production and the non
possessor, the relationship of wage labour on a mass scale as
the basis of an absolutely specific form of exploitation. The
proletarian is neither the ancient slave, nor the lumpen pro
letarian of Rome, nor the artisan of Greece, nor the serf, nor
the colonist. The proletariat is a class deprived of the means
of production, selling its labour power, a class concentrated in
huge masses, schooled by the mechanism of capitalist produc
tion, capable of organisation, of independent action and of
independent revolutionary thought. And in just the same way
the capitalist bourgeoisie is neither the Egyptian theocrats nor
the Greek traders of the days of Aristophanes. These are
new social categories, new classes of a new mode of production.
Finally, however we may estimate the learned men of ancient
China, the brilliant guesses of the Greek natural philosophers,
the Alexandrine inventors, the Egyptian geometricians, the
algebra of India or the Arabs, the astronomy of Babylon, these
are only embryos of what the powerful exact science of modern
capitalism can give us. Marxism is the product of an absolutely peculiar epoch and the system 
of ideas of an absolutely special class which former ages did not know.<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">5)</a></sup></P>

<P class="indent">2. Logically, Marxism is a scientific system, a scientific outlook and scientific practice, and 
for this reason alone cannot be stupidly &quot;compared&quot; to the prophets of Judæa to the mediaeval 
Taborites,
etc., with their corresponding eschatologies. It is utterly foolish to compare Marx's 
scientific forecasts to eschatalogical Utopias. All efforts at the logical destruction of 
Marxism, at refuting its
forecasts, all attempts at so-called scientific proofs of its logical inconsistency have 
themselves collapsed spectacularly beneath the heavy blows of reality. It now only remains for the dreaming
bourgeois to declare the very fact of a general crisis of capitalism, the very fact of 
proletarian revolutions, the very fact of the existence of the U.S.S.R. to be a myth. But this
means standing the real
world of real relationships on its head. Werner Sombart wrote in 1909, &quot;In 1883 Marx was 
considered by all theoreticians of bourgeois tendency as having been long ago 'refuted'.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">6)</a></sup> 
In the same work
he declared: &quot;Marx has theoretically and practically been surpassed (überwunden), he has 
exhausted his historical mission.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">7)</a></sup>  But in 1923 his disciple Arthur Prinz reaches the 
following conclusion:</P>

<P class="quotec">If ever any &quot;one simple thought&quot; has given another form (Gestalt) to the centuries, if ever any one man by what has come from him has given specific features (das Gepräge) to a whole epoch
(Zeitalter), then it is Karl Marx and his theory of the collapse of capitalism. If a third of 
the globe from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic is now in dreadful convulsions, which Marx 
would welcome as
the birth-pangs of a new society, then his works are one of the chief causes of this.<sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">8)</a></sup></P>

<P class="indent">Marxism from the point of view of its logical genesis was a creative synthesis of genius which arose on the basis of the most precious products of thought of the age. The great idealist 
philosophy of
Germany, critically refashioned and stood on its feet, the surmounting of Feuerbachism and the
creation of the theory of dialectical materialism, the revolutionising of English political 
economy from Sir
William Petty to Ricardo and the 
construction of a remarkable economic theory, French socialism and the &quot;conversion&quot; of 
socialism from a Utopia into a Science, these are the main lines of the ideological genesis of Marxism which
had its social roots in the growth and formation of the industrial proletariat as a class. On 
the basis of an astonishingly complete acquaintance with all disciplines, on the basis of an 
obstinate study of
modern natural science, from mathematics to geology, of an exceptional acquaintance with the 
literature and the history of all ages and peoples, of stubborn original work upon primary 
sources, of a
first class knowledge of world literature and world art, Marxism grew as the all-embracing 
system of ideas of a titanic class, formed by the titanic genius of Marx. Therefore the 
eschatological fantasies
of the movements of revolt of the past millenniums have the same relation to Marx's scientific
forecasts as the magic formulas of a witch-doctor to wireless telegraphy, or as books on 
elementary
alchemy to Mendeleev's table. Dialectical materialism, as the doctrine of the general 
connections and laws of being and becoming; the theory of historical materialism, as the 
doctrine of the laws of
social development; the theory of capitalist economy, its development and collapse; the theory of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat; the scientific anticipation
of genius of
further development (dictatorship of the proletariat, socialism, communism)-this is an 
immensely great scientific outlook such as no preceding age has known. And it is just for this reason that Marx's
revolutionary theory, by organising, welding together, and leading into battle millions of 
proletarians, has had such an exceptional influence on the whole course of historical 
development.</P>

<P>Not only is his influence great over the whole international Labour movement, but also over 
official bourgeois science. It is expressed in various ways. Marxism is now the object of 
violent criticism, for
no one can ignore it; or it is the cause of antithetic systems, and its powerful resistance is shown in theories in which each one of its principal arguments is taken over with another 
logical mark; or
else it serves as a source
from which separate parts are taken and all their revolutionary
corners planed off; or else it is &quot;accepted&quot; in order to be crushed
by the embrace, and so on. Marx in his lifetime, passionately
hating the bourgeoisie and their ideologies, and mortally hated
by them in turn, was, as is well known, surrounded by a con
spiracy of silence. His &quot;recognition &quot; began with recognition
as an economist, then passed into the sphere of history and the
methodology of history, and to-day is showing more and more
influence on philosophy and natural science. Adolf Held,<sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">9)</a></sup>  one
of the few economists who knew the works of Marx, wrote in
1878 that we must distinguish two aspects in him: &quot;on the
one hand, the element of economic socialism, i.e. the theory
of value and income, which, if we look at it in itself, is, it is true,
incorrect and utopian (!! N.B.) though fully deserving of dis
cussion, and, on the other hand, the political, revolutionary
element and the materialist tendency opposed to all recognised
laws of morality, which lies behind it.&quot; This god-fearing pro
fessor, from whom, by the way, Sombart drew his teaching on
the dual nature of Marx the scientist and Marx the revolutionary,
did not suspect that very soon it was to be just this &quot;tendency&quot; 
which would grip even his colleagues in the iron claws of its
unshakable logic, and that even the most important theological
historians of religion like E. Tröltsch would have to make declara
tions similar to the following: &quot;New problems grew up out of
all existing decisions....And then the Marxist teaching on
basis and superstructure gripped with immense force....&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#10" name="10b">10)</a></sup> 
Since Marx, who gave a powerful weapon into the hands of the
proletariat, bourgeois social science is passing through a chronic
decline. Its really valuable aspects, insofar as they exist at all,
to a great degree have Marx for their source, who is the more
harshly criticised, the more he is an object for cowardly plagiarism
or conscious distortion. In the sphere of economic literature,
it is enough to mention Böhm-Bawerk as an example of an anti
thetical system based on a &quot;criticism&quot; of the foundations of
Marxian theory, a doctrine which atone time prevailed very
widely in official university circles. Vilfredo Pareto and M. Panta
leoni are similar cases. The exceptional influence of Marx on
Werner Sombart and Tugan-Baranovski, Bücher, F. Oppenheim, is well known. In European economic
literature there is no writer of any importance who would dare to-day simply to &quot;keep quiet&quot; 
about Marx. In the field of history and the methodology of history, there is no one to-day who would decide to pass over the so-called &quot;economic factor&quot;. All the most distinguished 
historians fall
in some way or another under the influence of Marx's genius: Maxim Kovalevsky, Edward Meyer, 
Lamprecht, L. Humplowich, Von Below, Dopsch, Mathiez, Héritier, Seligman, Wipper and others.
The methodologists and philosophers of history, and even the philosophers, pay tribute to the 
genius of the proletariat, Benedetto Croce, Stampler, Max Weber, Tröltsch, Tönnies, Simmel, 
Loria, R.
Michels, Gentile (the present official philosopher of fascism)-all these have eaten of the 
fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Even the philosophers of ultra-modern systems, 
such as Max
Scheler, theoretician of the Catholic philosophy of to-day, draw to a great extent on the 
treasure-house of Marx's genius for &quot;their&quot; ideas. Whole schools in other spheres of 
knowledge which
border on history sometimes develop under the fascination of Marxist doctrine. Such, for 
example, is the whole anthropological school in Italy led by Enrico Ferri.<sup class="anote"><a href="#11" name="11b">11)</a></sup>  Last of all, very 
recently, under the
influence of Russian Marxist literature, the penetration of Marxism into the sphere of 
theoretical natural science has begun. If this was once chiefly to be seen in connection with 
biological questions
(especially the theme, Marxism and Darwinism), now the representatives of theoretical physics 
(e.g. Ph. Franck) are beginning to be drawn into the orbit of the Marxist presentation of 
different
methodological questions. The special critical literature on Marxism is inexhaustible.<sup class="anote"><a href="#12" name="12b">12)</a></sup>  Marx 
is the central problem of the ideological life of to-day in exactly the same way as communism 
is the
central problem of the whole social-historical development of our time.<sup class="anote"><a href="#13" name="13b">13)</a></sup></P>

<P>It follows that Marx's influence on official science has another more important aspect. 
Bourgeois science, both of itself, and by means of the theoreticians of social-democracy, that agency of
bourgeois influence over the proletariat, falsifies and distorts
Marx. It castrates him, it corrodes the revolutionary content from him, it distorts him 
unrecognisably. There are real barricades
of ideas between revolutionary Marxism and official science in this respect. But the very fact that it is compelled to take some
weapons out of the arsenal of its adversary shows how great is the ideological power of Marx's
theoretical creation.</P>

<P>Marxism is the synthesis of revolutionary theory and revolutionary practice. If the importance of Marx's theoretical
conception is unusually great, if to-day millions are marching under the banner of scientific 
communism, some to the
storming of the capitalist world, others straining their muscles and nerves on the practical 
problems of socialist construction,
then from this also is the social and functional importance of Marxism assumed. Humanity is 
living through a most critical
period. The catastrophe of capitalism is developing. The world is split. The powerful
mountain ranges of the new socialist world order are 1 being formed as the result of the 
creative effort of the victorious
proletariat in the U.S.S.R. Marxism is beginning to conquer ever new spheres for itself. Marx,
so many times slain by his
critics and falsifiers, rises again in his full stature as the allembracing genius of the 
centuries. Marxism is directly transformed
into the theoretical practice and the practical theory of the greatest of social revolutions. 
Against it, all the terrorist and
militant forces of the old, dying world, led by fascism, all their allies, all their reserves, are massing in a furious class struggle.
Fascism's slogan, destroy Marxism, has therefore a very deep historical significance. Hegel 
says that philosophy is an epoch
expressed in thought. But our epoch is one of bifurcation on the grand scale, for it is an 
epoch of the birth of a new social
system, socialism; for it is an epoch in which the class struggle is lifted up to such heights
of principle as never before; for it
is an epoch in which a new class, the proletariat, already appears on the stage of history as 
its coming demiurge, a class
already grasping the helm of power, of economy and of culture in the vast territory of the 
Soviet Union; for it is an epoch in
which the contradictions of a capitalism that has outlived itself have brought its organism to the unparalleled convulsions of
an
unprecedented crisis; for it is an epoch in which all the real forces and potentials of a new 
world are marching with the
slogans of a new, mercilessly bold, scientific and yet revolutionary doctrine which embraces 
the whole sum of the problems
of our time, an outlook whose creator and founder was Karl Marx. The bourgeoisie, scared and 
without confidence in the
security of its régime, is going over to mysticism and inventing its own apocalyptic, 
counter-revolutionary eschatology.<sup class="anote"><a href="#14" name="14b">14)</a></sup>
The proletariat marches under the banner of revolutionary science.</P>
