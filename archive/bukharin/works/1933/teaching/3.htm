<H3>3. The Theory of Capitalism</H3>

<P>Marx takes capitalist society as a specific historical category. It is a society working on a 
machine technique of which the economic structure possesses peculiar distinguishing marks. It 
is a society
producing for the market (commodity production); it is a society in which the means of 
production belong to a special class purchasing labour power (the capitalist bourgeoisie) and 
which is in
opposition to its antipodes, deprived of the means of production and selling its labour power 
(the proletariat). Only in the combination of these conditions do the means of production 
become capital,
the decisive mass of products and labour power, value, labour, the producer of surplus value. 
In such conditions social production is capitalist production, the process of the self increase 
of capital. A
special &quot;law of motion&quot; of this specific society is discovered and is the task of theoretical 
economy in &quot;the narrow sense&quot; (in distinction from political economy in &quot;the broad sense&quot;, 
which also
embraces other historical-economic formations).<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup> The very statement of the problem is a 
complete revolution in science, for before Marx (and after Marx insofar as it is a question of bourgeois
science) the categories of political economy were taken as the &quot;eternal&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; 
categories of any productive process. In this lies &quot;all the wisdom of modern economists who 
are trying to
prove the eternal nature and harmony of existing social conditions&quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2)</a></sup> Thus &quot;Capital is not a 
thing. It is a definite interrelation in social production
belonging to a definite historical formation of society. This
interrelation expresses itself through a certain thing and gives to
this thing a specific social character&quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">3)</a></sup> Only when the means
of production (things) are means of exploitation, and even then
on the basis of commodity production, of hired labour power, do
they become capital.<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">4)</a></sup> Marxism rejects any general, unhistorical,
eternal statement of the problem, either a vulgarly naturalistic
one derived directly from the thing, or a &quot;psychological&quot; one
derived from the relation of man to the thing. The laws of
economic theory are social-historical laws.  But Marxism also
inevitably rejects attempts to separate social relations from things
and thus to spiritualise these relations. Capital is not a thing
but a relationship appearing in things, that is, not a bare relationship between people outside of any material relatedness to things.
A thing would not be capital if there were not a definite social
relationship. But, on the other hand, if it were not for &quot;things&quot;
(means of production) there would not be capital. In relation
to the process of labour as such, the social-historical structure is
the form. In relation to the historical structure labour is the
content. But this content is always given in its concretely
historical form. Outside of it, it becomes simply meaningless,
an empty and contentless abstraction. Hence it follows that the
object of the economic theory of capitalism is the process of
production and reproduction in its historical form. For the
Marxist theory of capitalism does not work on idealist sociology
but on the materialist conception of history. As we have seen,
the materialist conception of history embraces theoretically the
&quot;general laws&quot; (Engels) of social development, including at the
same time the &quot;laws of movement&quot; of different historical structures as a whole, the reproduction of the whole of social life, from
its materialist basis to its ideological sublimations. Economic
theory analyses the reproduction only of these materialist foundations. The economic theory of capitalism (political economy in
&quot;the narrow sense&quot;) analyses the specific &quot;laws of movement&quot;
only of one historically limited structure, the laws of movement
of capitalist economy, i.e. the reproduction (understood in its
arising, development and inevitable end) of the material basis of
capitalist society. Thus the materialist conception of history is logically the premise of the
theory of capitalism. Here too is shown the great compactness of the theoretical building which 
Marx
constructed. Consequently the attempts to separate Marx's economic theory from his sociological 
theory are absolutely stupid, just as it is stupid to separate his sociological doctrine (the 
theory of
historical materialism) from his philosophical doctrine (the theory of dialectical 
materialism). If the labour process has such an immense importance from the point of view of 
the theory of historical
materialism, then it is perfectly clear that it must also have a decisive importance in the 
theory of political economy. If the conception of the mode of production is one of the main 
conceptions of the
theory of historical materialism, then it is perfectly clear what importance this category must 
have for economic science. It is of course not accidental that Marx gave his classical 
exposition of the
historical-materialist conception as the preface to <I>The Critique of Political Economy</I>. It is 
not here just a matter of external form. The profoundest inner meaning is present here. The 
materialist
conception of history is the premise (the &quot;preface&quot; in the broad meaning of the word) of 
economic theory in general and the economic theory of capitalism in particular. Consequently 
all kinds of
theoretical economic idealism, of subjectivism, of non-historical views, are absolutely alien 
and deeply hostile to Marxism. &quot;The relations between people&quot; are here taken not as forms of a
psychological connection, but as being objectively the historical presentation of the labour 
process. The separation of this historical form from its content leads inevitably to its 
separation both from
materialism and dialectic. For the chief contradiction lies in the sphere of the conflict 
between this content and its form. The analysis of this objective, real contradiction is the 
core of the whole
theory. The categories of political economy must therefore reflect the material process of 
production in its specifically historical social form. <sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">5)</a></sup></P>

<P>Capitalist production is the generalised form of commodity production, when labour power also 
becomes a commodity which gives an absolutely original appearance to the whole economic
structure. Commodity production in general has an extremely
important peculiarity, unknown in any form of natural economy.
This peculiarity lies in the fact that the social connection between
the different commodity producers is formed through exchange.
The social character of labour in this divided social whole, of
which the agents are formally independent of one another, is not
recognised by the subjects participating in economy. Here we
have a spontaneous character in development, its &quot;blind&quot; course.
Here the spontaneous and irrational social law is in direct opposition to the separate commodity producer. So here we have a
special connection between the causal and teleological range of
phenomena. Commodity and commodity-capitalist society is not
the aim-proposing subject, it is not a &quot;teleological unity&quot;, as,
for example, under the socialist mode of production. It is split
up, though relatively united. It is not a mechanical sum of parts,
the various commodity producers and enterprises are not membra 
disjecta: society nevertheless exists as such. But the type of
inter-economic connection by means of exchange is an absolutely
special type. The character of social unity is here extremely
original. This is not the unity of a purposive organisation,
but the spontaneous, anarchic, exceedingly contradictory and
relative unity of formally independent agents of commodity production nevertheless objectively connected with one another.
Society, as a whole, cannot here, by its very nature, give itself
any kind of aims, for it is not a unified subject, but only the
artificially functioning and anarchical combination (not sum !)
of &quot;members&quot; connected with one another. They, the separate
commodity-producers, set themselves aims, for each of them
is a &quot;purposive subject&quot; subordinating his actions to the
principle of economic rationalism sub-specie profit. But the
social product of their intersecting wills and corresponding actions
is far from coinciding with these aims, but partially directly
contradicts them (ruin in the competitive struggle, bankruptcy
in time of crisis, lowering of the average rate of profit, etc.).
This is the so-called law of heterogeneity of aims, which is
extremely typical for capitalist society. Therefore the causal
laws of development have no directly teleological expression,
which might conceal them and be their teleological hypostasis.
There is here no such state of things as would allow us to examine one and the same phenomenon
both theoretically (scientifically, causally) and according to a standard (teleologically, 
practically). We can talk of the
causes of crises, but it is impossible to talk of their expediency from the point of view of 
the active agents of capitalist production and the conscious rationality of action (crises are not brought about, nor made, crises
make themselves, i.e. arise spontaneously). Here there is no freedom for society as a whole, as 
a recognised necessity, but there is necessity and nothing else, confronting the agents of this 
society, as external in relation to
them, independent of their will, an objective law, &quot;blind&quot;, &quot;iron&quot;, against which there is 
no remedy within the framework of the given society, for it is immanent in it. The social 
structure itself is the embodiment of this
spontaneity. Society is here &quot;Gesellschaft&quot; and not &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot;, if we use the same 
terms as Tönnies.<sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">6)</a></sup> To discover the &quot;laws of movement&quot; of this society in its developed form, 
i.e. in that of capitalist society,
is the task of <I>Capital</I>. Any society, whatever its historical form, must distribute (or there 
must be distributed within it) its joint labour - either well or ill - among the different spheres of production.</P>

<P class="quote">The masses of products corresponding to the different needs require different and 
quantitatively determined masses of the total social labour. That this necessity of 
distributing social labour in definite proportions cannot
be done away with by the <I>particular form</I> of social production, but can only change <I>the form it assumes</I>, is selfevident. No natural laws can be done away with.... And the form in which 
this proportional division of
labour operates, in a state of society where the interconnection of social labour is manifested 
in the <I>private exchange</I> of the individual products of labour, is precisely the exchange value 
of these products?<sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">7)</a></sup></P>

<P>In other words, in anarchistic &quot;blind&quot; society, in which development is spontaneous, there must 
be a law of development which would spontaneously, while opposing a &quot;blind law &quot; to people, 
regulate in some way or
other the distribution of labour in the various spheres of production. This &quot;blind&quot; &quot;law of 
movement&quot; which acts as spontaneous regulator, is the law of value, which acts through the 
market and the &quot;barometric
fluctuations of price&quot;. Value is the quantity of socially-necessary
labour expended on the production of a unit of a commodity, in
distinction from its use value, determined by the natural substance
of the commodity. Price is the empirical market expression of
value. That price has a definite connection with the productivity
of social labour, and, consequently with the quantity of value (in
its Marxist sense), is evident at the first glance. But the matter
is even deeper if looked at from the point of view of social reproduction as a whole, that is the regular repetitions of the productive
cycle. From this point of view exchange is a definite &quot;factor&quot;
of reproduction inferring its further progress. The empirically
superficial laws of exchange therefore draw into themselves the
deeper laws which derive from the sphere of production and
appear in exchange. The empirically superficial facts are facts
of the market to which price categories correspond. But value
stands behind the back of price. This is far from being a metaphysical reduplication of price, but is a deep and general law of
the movement of commodity economy on which alone it is
possible to understand the movement of prices. In simple commodity-economy price fluctuates around value as its centre. If
too much of a given commodity is produced the price falls, a
redistribution of labour power takes place in this production.
If a small amount is produced the opposite takes place. Prices
rise, labour power pours in and thus another redistribution of joint
labour time takes place. In capitalist society the mechanism of
fluctuation is more complex. Here prices fluctuate around the
&quot;cost of production&quot;, and not directly around value. The social
interdependence of the different fractional parts of the socially
divided labour, the objective connection between the subjectively
independent commodity producers is fixed behind their back.
Whether much or little of the commodities <I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>c</I> has been
produced is only fixed indirectly, from the signs given by prices.
Proportions in the distribution of labour change continually in
accordance with the change in the productivity of labour. So the
&quot;blind&quot; objective law of special connections and relations
between people which regulates the process of material production, assumes the form of a quality of the thing (the value of the
commodity piece). In a dismembered society in which even the
spheres of production are not organically whole and in which the
main principle is the extreme contradictoriness of the whole
structure, the laws of the distribution and redistribution of productive forces (in the last resort the mass of labour, dead or alive)
can appear in no other way than through their expression in commodity pieces, as values, which in their turn have their general
money equivalent. If there is no organised production and
organised distribution, if the process of exchange is formed from
a number of separate and different exchange acts, in which
separate commodity units appear, then it is only through the value
of a commodity piece and, correlatively, its price, that the process
of the redistribution of the masses of labour can take place in its
social scale. &quot;Social&quot;, in the sense of the distribution of
quantities of labour over the social spheres of production, is here
not given all at once, in unbroken front, it is not given as single
acts of the distribution of labour which embrace whole spheres in
their totality. The &quot;social&quot; is here formed from the &quot;individual&quot;, which in its turn grows up on the basis of social
determinants objectively given. The functioning of money as the
general value equivalent is also connected with this. The rôle
of the measure of value, of the price scale, etc., this is all
&quot;adapted&quot; to serving this kind of reproduction which is inferred
by the infinite quantity of exchange acts, and not by the organised
distribution of quantities of labour all at once on a scale of whole
spheres of social production. Therefore money is the &quot;soul&quot;
of commodity economy. So the social law which regulates the
distribution of quantities of labour among spheres of production
and expresses the mutual work of human beings connected by the
division of labour, assumes the form of a quality of the thing.
On this foundation we get a universal aberration, characteristic
for the commodity capitalist world. The relations of human
beings are perceived as relations of things. This is the phenomenon which Marx called commodity fetishism and which
appears in an extremely bloated form in the categories of bourgeois
political economy, starting with the fetishism of the elementary
commodity and passing through the fetishism of money to finish
in the fetishism of capital.<sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">8)</a></sup> The social relations of human beings, appearing in the substance 
money, are represented as a quality of things (gold, the power of gold, the golden calf). The 
social
relations of people, which only appear in the substance capital, are represented as qualities 
of the means of production in general. These means of production are divided up of themselves 
by a
supernatural force which engenders profit (the theory of the &quot;productivity of capital&quot;) just 
as the earth is divided up of itself by an illusory force which engenders rent. It is from such 
categories
that the conceptions of bourgeois theoretical economy are made up.</P>

<P>If Adam Smith investigated the &quot;wealth of nations&quot;, Marx begins his <I>Capital</I> with an analysis 
of &quot;the wealth of societies in which the capitalist mode of production reigns&quot;, wealth whose
elementary form is the commodity. In the dual character of labour (abstract and concrete 
labour), in the contradiction between the value and use value of a commodity, are already found 
the further
contradictions whose movement conditions the movement of capitalist society as a whole.</P>

<P>The development of exchange also draws labour power into its orbit (Marx describes the 
historical and violent premises of this with intense force). Labour power also becomes a 
commodity, but a
commodity sui generis, a special and specific commodity, although &quot;subordinated&quot; to the 
general laws of commodity circulation.</P>

<P>Labour power has both value and use value. Its value is determined in exactly the same way as 
that of other commodities. In the general circuit of the vital process, from the point of view of
reproduction as a whole, that is from the point of view of the repetition of the productive 
process, the reproduction of labour power is an essential factor. The reproduction of labour 
power is a
process of consumption (the unity of production and consumption is manifested in this; a unity
which does not exclude but presupposes contradictions). This process of consumption is in its 
turn
a process of transferring values of the means of consumption into the new sphere of production of labour power. Thus the value of labour power is fixed by the value of the 
necessary means of existence (which vary in accordance with the different qualifications of 
this peculiar form of commodity). The use value of labour power (for which the capitalist buys it) is fixed
by the fact that it possesses the quality of being able to develop a greater quantity of labour 
than it needs for its own reproduction. So that even if the capitalist pays for his labour 
power according
to its full value, he still has a surplus value left. The general formula of capital is M 
(money)-C (commodity)-M' (money increased). So accumulation is created, not in the sphere of 
circulation, but in
the sphere of production, and is only realised in circulation. Consequently the process of 
capitalist production is a process of the production of surplus value.<sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">9)</a></sup></P>

<P>This discovery of the secret of surplus value is a discovery of the main levers of the 
capitalist mechanism, of the main inner springs of its self-movement. Neither Smith nor Ricardo 
drew any
distinction between labour and labour power and so became confused in contradictions as soon as 
ever it was necessary on the basis of the theory of labour value, to explain the fact of surplus
value.<sup class="anote"><a href="#10" name="10b">10)</a></sup></P>

<P>Surplus value, in its turn, is divided into an accumulated section and a section consumed by 
the capitalists and their servants. The accumulated part, i.e. the one incorporated in 
functioning capital,
of surplus value, is in its turn, like capital as a whole, divided into a constant part (the 
means of production) and a variable part (labour power). In the process of production constant capital
(constantes Kapital, &quot;<I>c</I>&quot;) merely transfers its value into the value of the product. Variable 
capital (variables Kapital, &quot;<I>v</I>&quot;) not only reproduces its value, entering into the composition 
of the value of
the product produced, but also creates surplus value (Mehrwert, &quot;<I>m</I>&quot;). The labour day is divided into two parts, the necessary labour time when the workers reproduce the value of their 
labour
power, and the surplus time when surplus value is created. Correspondingly the mass of surplus
value can be increased either (1) by dint of increasing the working day (&quot;absolute surplus 
value&quot;),
or (2) by dint of curtailing the necessary labour time (&quot;relative surplus value&quot;). The first 
is connectted with direct attacks on the workers. The second is directly connected with raising the 
productivity of labour in the production of means of consumption.</P>

<P>Capitalism differs from other forms of exploiters' economy (slave-owning systems, feudalism) by 
the fact that the greed for surplus value is unlimited. If the natural exploiters' formations 
had limits in
the needs of the ruling classes, then here we have a limitless &quot;drive for profit&quot;, without 
any previously given limits to accumulation. At the same time the inner tendencies of 
development powerfully
force on the whole process. Here the mechanism, in conditions of free competition, was as 
follows
the value of the commodity is fixed by the quantity of socially necessary labour (i.e. 
necessary for the production of the given commodity with an average technique and other average 
quantities).
The enterprise with a higher technique has a greater productivity of labour and consequently a
much lower individual value of the commodity unit. But in the market it is a matter of socially
necessary labour time. So the difference between these quantities is the basis for getting 
differential profit (surplus value is broken into different streams, whilst profit is part of 
the whole surplus
value which flows to the industrial capitalist in opposition to other forms of capital and to 
landowning, which receives rent). The conditions of market competition force the rest to follow 
the general
model and what was an exception becomes typical, the whole level is raised, all scales are 
changed and a new circle begins. Thus, if the application of machines is the technical basis of 
capitalism
whilst the machine is itself an historical category, then the economic conditions of capitalism 
have a tendency towards the continual revolutionising of the methods of production and its 
technical
basis. But, on the other hand, this growth of the productive forces of capitalist society comes 
into conflict with the limited conditions of capitalist appropriation. The analysis of this 
contradiction is
one of the essential parts of Marx's economic theory.</P>

<P>Together with the process of accumulation the organic composition of capital (<I>c</I> / <I>v</I>) is raised, the relation of constant to variable
capital, that is the mass of means of production is increased, the raw material and so on put 
into motion by a single worker, and simultaneously the productivity of social labour grows at 
an immense
speed.</P>

<P>The process of the production of capital, examined as a regularly repetitive process, is a 
process of simple reproduction when there is no accumulation and of enlarged reproduction when there is
accumulation. This process of reproduction represents in itself an immense theoretical problem, 
for the course of reproduction presupposes a unity of production and circulation and also 
technical
correspondences and proportions fixed not only in value, quantitatively, economically, but also 
naturally and qualitatively. Schematically Marx's teaching on the reproduction of capital can be
represented as follows:</P>

<P>Let the whole social product equal <I>c</I> + <I>v</I> + <I>m</I><BR>
A (production of the means of production) = <I>c</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>v</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>m</I><sub>1</sub><br>
B (production of the objects of consumption) = <I>c</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>v</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>m</I><sub>2</sub></P>

<P>In the case of simple reproduction we have the following as its necessary conditions.</P>

<P>1. Since the whole product A (i.e. the sum of <I>c</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>v</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>m</I><sub>1</sub>) consists entirely of means of 
production (conditionally, the iron, coal, machine, substantial husk), then it must all go on 
the compensation
of the constant capital of both subdivisions, i.e. the necessary condition of reproduction is 
the premise expressed in the equation <I>c</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>v</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>m</I><sub>1</sub> = <I>c</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>c</I><sub>2</sub>.</P>

<P>2. Since the whole product B (i.e. <I>c</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>v</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>m</I><sub>2</sub>) entirely consists of objects of consumption 
(conditionally, a textile wheat natural form), then it must go entirely in the consumption of 
the capitalists and
workers of both sub-sections in conditions of simple reproduction. This brings us to the 
equation: <I>c</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>v</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>m</I><sub>2</sub> = <I>v</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>m</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>v</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>m</I><sub>2</sub>.</P>

<P>3. Since A itself produces for itself its own constant capital c<sub>1</sub> and must give up the 
remainder for B (i.e. <I>v</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>m</I><sub>1</sub>), then B itself produces for itself <I>v</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>m</I><sub>2</sub> and must give up 
c<sub>2</sub> for A, that is <I>c</I><sub>2</sub> = <I>v</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>m</I><sub>1</sub>.</P>

<P>On rearranging the first two equations they give a third equation. And this is the condition 
for simple reproduction. <I>The sum of 
the incomes of the first subdivision must equal the constant capital of the second subdivision</I>.</P>

<P>In the case of enlarged reproduction it is a much more complex matter. Here also it is possible 
to bring out a system of equations which will show the possibility of such a reproduction in the
corresponding conditions of the whole process.</P>

<P>Let us suppose that:<BR>
<I>m</I><sub>1</sub> = <I>&alpha;</I><sub>1</sub> (goes to the consumption of the capitalists) + &beta;, (which is capitalised);</P>

<P align="center"><I>m</I><sub>2</sub> = <I>&alpha;</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>&beta;</I><sub>2</sub></P>

<P>Let us suppose further that:<BR>
<I>&beta;</I><sub>1</sub> = <I>&beta;</I><sub>1c</sub> (which is subject to accumulation as a part of constant 
capital) + <I>&beta;</I><sub>1v</sub> (which is accumulated as a part of variable capital).</P>

<P align="center"><I>&beta;</I><sub>2</sub> = <I>&beta;</I><sub>2c</sub> + <I>&beta;</I><sub>2v</sub></P>

<P>Then the general product of both subdivisions is expressed in the formula:</P>

<center>
<table border="0">
<tr>
	<td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
	<td><center><I>&beta;</I><sub>1</sub><br><hr size="1" noshade width="80%"></center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td width="70">A</td>
	<td><I>c</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>v</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>&alpha;</I><sub>1</sub></td>
	<td> + <I>&beta;</I><sub>1c</sub> + <I>&beta;</I><sub>1v</sub></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td width="70">B</td>
	<td><I>c</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>v</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>&alpha;</I><sub>2</sub></td>
	<td> + <I>&beta;</I><sub>2c</sub> + <I>&beta;</I><sub>2v</sub></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
	<td><center><hr size="1" noshade width="80%"><I>&beta;</I><sub>2</sub></center></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<P>In the sphere A, <I>c</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>&beta;</I><sub>1c</sub> must remain by force of its natural form, the rest [(<I>v</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>&alpha;</I><sub>1</sub>) + <I>&beta;</I><sub>1</sub>] must be cancelled. In the sphere B, <I>v</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>&alpha;</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>&beta;</I><sub>2</sub> remains, (<I>c</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>&beta;</I><sub>2c</sub>) on the other hand, 
must be cancelled.</P>

<P>So we get the equation:</P>

<center><P>[(<I>v</I><sub>1</sub> + <I>&alpha;</I><sub>1</sub>) + <I>&beta;</I><sub>1v</sub>] = <I>c</I><sub>2</sub> + <I>&beta;</I><sub>2c</sub></P></center>

<P>which is the condition for enlarged reproduction in its most 
general form. Of course, in reality the whole process, since it is contradictory, proceeds far
from smoothly and the
schemes themselves can only be looked upon as an expression of tendencies with a definite law, and as nothing more.</P>

<P>It is exceedingly important to note that the analysis of the conditions of enlarged 
reproduction given by Marx in his famous
arithmetically formulated schemes in the second volume of <I>Capital</I> brings in both the value 
(economic) and the natural (technical) aspect of reproduction. The process of exchange between the two
spheres presupposes not only a &quot;logic&quot; of value but also one of technique, which is derived 
from the law of technical interconnection of the different spheres of production. So here there 
clearly
appears the whole impermissibility of separation from the &quot;things&quot; in which &quot;social 
relations&quot; manifest themselves.</P>

<P>The process of reproduction is the process of the reproduction of commodities, it is a process of reproduction of surplus value. It is the process of reproduction of the productive relations 
themselves
and of their class agents. The structure of capitalist society, as a specifically historical 
category, is a special class structure. Therefore this class character of capitalism is 
expressed and reflected in
the specific categories of political economy. If value expresses the objectively given fact of
the social co-operation of people in any commodity economy (here, consequently, it is a 
question of the
cluster of social connections horizontally, outside the vertical class hierarchy), then the 
category of surplus value already expresses the relation of class exploitation, whose object is 
the wage
labourer. If money is the more abstract reflection of co-operation in commodity economy, then 
capital (including money capital) is the classical class relationship of exploitation. If the 
form of
commodity is not yet eloquent of the class structure of society (commodities also exist in 
simple commodity economy), the commodity of labour power is, however, already a category of 
class
capitalist society. Division into classes is founded directly on the relations of human groups to the means of production. From the polarised relations to the means of production there arise 
the
different functions in the productive process, the different positions in the process of 
distribution (various kinds of &quot;income&quot;), and different (for the class poles of the polarised 
opposites) material
interests which condition the class struggle. The class division of capitalist society runs 
therefore like a red thread through all the main categories of Marx's political economy, in an adequate
expression of the contradictory movement of capitalist reality. The transformation of the 
historical transition
form into a &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;eternal&quot; one is characteristic of bourgeois economic theory. So 
also are the illusory &quot;destruction&quot; of all the real contradictions of capitalism and the 
setting up in their
place of social &quot;harmony&quot;, the general concealing and damping down of the class struggle.<sup class="anote"><a href="#11" name="11b">11)</a></sup> 
Marx, on the other hand, gives an analysis of genius of all the contradictory factors in 
capitalism, while
the class struggle is revealed at the heart of all the main categories. &quot;Wages&quot; contain an &quot;historical and moral element&quot;, being the converted price (i.e. value) of labour power and at 
the same time
expressing the relation between the contending class forces. Surplus value is correlative with the value of labour power. The length of the working day, the rate of exploitation (the 
relationship <I>m</I> : <I>v</I>),
accumulation, the divided forms of surplus value (profit, rent, etc.), these categories all 
express the real class relations in capitalist society. With Marx &quot;economic&quot; and &quot;social&quot; 
are indivisible. The
main class categories of economic theory, specific for capitalism, inevitably assume the form 
of value.</P>

<P>Thus the problem of &quot;Machtgesetz-ökonomisches Gesetz&quot;, the problem of the relations between &quot;economic law&quot; and &quot;class force&quot;, is solved by Marx in such a way that the relations of force
between the classes are included in the movement of economic quantities. Not &quot;pure economic&quot; 
and &quot;non-class&quot;, &quot;a-social&quot; categories which are only &quot;distorted&quot; by categories of 
another kind,
categories of a &quot;special&quot;, &quot;class&quot; character; not &quot;economics on the one hand and classes 
on the other&quot;, but social-economic categories in which class. division is included as the characteristic
feature of their specifically historic nature, this is what is characteristic for Marxist 
economic theory. In accordance with this, the capitalist mode of production is, says Marx, &quot;on the one hand the
process by which the material requirements of life are produced, and on the other hand a 
process which takes place under specific historical and economic conditions of production and 
which
produces and reproduces these conditions of production themselves, and with them the human 
agents of this process....&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#12" name="12b">12)</a></sup></P>

<P>Bourgeois political economy has seen three &quot;purely economic&quot;, &quot;non-historical&quot;, &quot;factors of production&quot;: capital, land and labour, which &quot;naturally&quot; 
give birth to three kinds of income, interest, rent and wages. Whilst here there takes place in 
reality a division
of the value produced by labour, with a disintegration of surplus value on the basis of the 
monopoly of specific means of production, these &quot;factors&quot; appear fetishistically to the 
agents of capital aid
their ideologues as the independent sources of revenue and even as the very value substance of this revenue.<sup class="anote"><a href="#13" name="13b">13)</a></sup> &quot;Rent grows out of the earth&quot;, &quot;gold gives birth to gold&quot;. All the recent 
and latest
theories of &quot;imputation&quot;, of &quot;productivity&quot;, etc. (&quot;Zurechnungstheorien&quot;), are built upon 
this fetishistic illusion.</P>

<P>The process of the reproduction of capital as a whole, as a unity of production and 
accumulation, in order to be understood calls for an explanation of the divergence of price 
from value. In simple
commodity economy value is a &quot;law of movement&quot; directly apparent in prices. In capitalist 
society fluctuations of prices occur around &quot;production prices&quot;, and from this point of view the law of
value is converted into the law of the prices of production, which appears as the historical 
development of the law of value and can only be understood on the basis of the latter.</P>

<P>To understand this transformation it is essential to remember that the capitalists are 
interested in a profit on the whole of their capital expended. If we put the landowners, etc., on one side and accept
that the whole surplus value equals the sum of profit, while society consists only of workers 
and capitalists, then the quantity (<I>m</I> / <I>c</I> + <I>v</I>) will interest the latter. But in fact capitals of
different organic composition exist, since surplus value is created 
only by living labour, i.e. variable capital, then	(<I>m</I> / <I>c</I> + <I>v</I>) would inevitably vary everywhere where there 
is a difference in the organic composition of capital. However, it is perfectly clear that 
through the mingling of capitals and on the basis of competition a spontaneous irresistible 
tendency to an average rate of profit is formed, that is to say, such a rate of profit as corresponds to the composition of the whole total of 
social capital. Marx showed that, as a result of this, prices in those sections of industry 
with a high
composition of capital diverge above, and those with a low composition, below the value, and 
that prices do not fluctuate directly around value but around so-called production prices (the
costs of
production plus the average profit). Thus the law is here much more complex than in simple 
commodity economy. The superficial and directly empirical fact of the market price is explained 
by the
prices of production, the latter by the average profit and the average profit by the organic 
composition of capital, which, in its turn, is explained by the whole sum of surplus value and the whole sum
of capital.<sup class="anote"><a href="#14" name="14b">14)</a></sup></P>

<P>We cannot dwell here on the whole immense wealth of ideas given in the three volumes of his gigantic work (in particular on the great importance of the question of the converted forms of surplus
value, the theory of ground rent, etc.) and we will pass to the explanation of those more 
fundamental tendencies in the development of capitalism which arise from his analysis and are 
formulated by
him.</P>

<P>1. The drive for profit, which is the specific regulating principle in capitalism, leads to the 
individual capitalist striving to get a surplus profit and to get it by the introduction of new 
technique. New
technique, by raising the productivity of labour in the given enterprise, temporarily creates 
for it this surplus, differential profit. But the process of competition, and, as a result, the 
raising of the whole
technical level, leads to an immense increase in the organic composition of capital in its 
social scale (<I>c</I> : <I>v</I>) and to a rapid increase in the productivity of social labour. But since 
the total surplus value
is created by the total <I>v</I>, the growth of which lags behind <I>c</I>, then there inevitably follows from this a tendency for the rate of profit (<I>m</I> / <I>c</I> + <I>v</I>) to fall.</P>

<P>2. Accumulation, which has its expression in the growth of <I>c</I> / <I>v</I> creates specifically capitalist laws of the movement of population. 
Surplus &quot;hands&quot; are created, the so-called &quot;reserve army of industry&quot; which grows the more 
rapidly the &quot;greater the social wealth, the amount of capital at work, the extent and energy 
of its growth&quot;.<sup class="anote"><a href="#15" name="15b">15)</a></sup> The greater the reserve army in comparison with the active, working section of the 
proletariat, the greater is the mass chronic overpopulation and the stronger is officially 
recognised pauperism. &quot;This is the absolute general law of capitalist accumulation.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#16" name="16b">16)</a></sup></P>

<P>3. The drive for profit, as the motive force of accumulation, i.e. of the process of the growth 
of capital, makes production an aim in itself, cutting it off from consumption. The possibility 
of conflict is
already to be found in embryo in the elementary form of the commodity, in the opposition of 
abstract and concrete labour, of value and use value. The movement of capital by systematically
revolutionising technique and creating to an overgrowing extent mass production, tends towards its unlimited enlargement. If, on the one hand, the growth of <I>c</I> : <I>v</I> implies an immense growth of
production, on the other hand it also implies the putting of definite limits to that growth, 
for it implies a tendency to a relative curtailment of the mass of effective demand, defined by 
the movement of
quantity of the whole variable capital (<I>v</I>). So here we have a contradiction between the growth 
of the productive forces of capitalism and its economic structure (&quot;the capitalist husk&quot;), 
which
determines the falling behind of <I>v</I>. The analysis of the conditions of reproduction shows that, 
speaking generally, enlarged capitalist reproduction is fully possible, even without the 
so-called &quot;third
persons&quot; (i.e., for example, the peasants). But the contradictory tendencies of development, 
owing to its elemental march, the possibility of vast preliminary investments in the production 
of the
means of production, investments which only afterwards almost unexpectedly appear in the mass 
of completed articles of consumption, periodically lead to collisions between production and the
effective mass demand, collisions which take place in the form of periodical industrial crises.</P>

<P>4. The competitive struggle among capitalists leads to the
inevitable victorious march of large-scale production. Pre-capitalist forms perish. Capital overwhelms them with its machines, and consequently with a 
high productivity of labour, and therefore with low prices. Large-scale production has all these
advantages in the competitive struggle. Therefore simple accumulation (and the concentration of 
capital corresponding to it) goes hand in hand with the ruin of the conquered, with the doom of
handicrafts, with the perishing of the small and medium capitalists, with the passing of their
capitals into the hands of the conquerors, with the centralisation of capital. The 
concentration and
centralisation of capital are thus the consequence of deep causes enrooted in the very 
structure of capitalist relations in general and of capitalist competition in particular.</P>

<P>5. The accumulation of wealth on the one hand is accompanied by the accumulation of poverty on the other. Class contradictions are not only not softened, but, on the contrary, are sharpened.
Immense human masses are transformed into wage labourers, are utilised by the mechanism of 
capitalist production itself and are in opposition to capital as a subversive, revolutionary, 
mass force.</P>

<P>6. On the other hand, the concentration and centralisation of the powerful means of production and the socialisation of labour proceed apace. These material prerequisites of the new society,
expressing the growth of the productive forces of capitalism, come into conflict with its 
productive relations. The social character of labour comes into contradiction with the 
individual character of
appropriation, production conflicts with consumption, the productive forces revolt against the productive relations. This fundamental contradiction breaks out periodically and is 
periodically &quot;solved&quot; in crises only to be reproduced on a new and wider basis. In other words, the process of 
enlarged capitalist reproduction appears also as a process of the enlarged reproduction of all its
contradictions, which is inevitably bound up with the final explosion of the relative unity of
society, i.e. with the socialist revolution of the proletariat. So the constant technical 
revolution and growth
of the productive forces of capitalism leads with iron necessity to a revolution which destroys 
capitalism. This is not an automatic process of the collapse of capitalism. But the objective 
development
of its contradictions determines the class will 
in such manner that the proletariat comes forward openly as the grave-digger of bourgeois 
society.</P>

<p class="quote">While there is thus a progressive diminution in the number of the capitalist magnates (who 
usurp and monopolise all the advantages of this transformative process), there occurs a 
corresponding increase in the mass of
poverty, oppression, enslavement, degeneration and exploitation; but all the same there is a 
steady intensification of the wrath of the working class-a class which grows ever more 
numerous, and is disciplined, unified, and
organised by the very mechanism of the capitalist method of production. Capitalist monopoly 
becomes a fetter upon the method of production which has flourished with it and under it. The 
centralisation of the means of
production and the socialisation of labour reach a point where they can prove incompatible with 
their capitalist husk. This bursts asunder. The knell of capitalist private property sounds. 
The expropriators are
expropriated. <sup class="anote"><a href="#17" name="17b">17</a></sup></p>

<P>With such words of fire, which cover the deepest penetration of the secret of social dialectic, 
does Marx characterise &quot;the historical tendency of capitalist accumulation&quot;. That which he 
formulated so monumentally in the
<I>Communist Manifesto</I>, the heroic song of genius of revolutionary scientific creation, as the 
foundation of the practice of the proletarian revolution, here in <I>Capital</I> found its full force with all the connections and deductions
of a proved scientific forecast.</P>

<P>Marx himself estimated his scientific work as follows at a quite early period, in 1852, even 
before the appearance of <I>Capital</I>.</P>

<P>And now as to myself, no credit is due to me for discovering the existence of classes in modern 
society nor yet the struggle between them. Long before me bourgeois historians had described 
the historical development of
this class struggle and bourgeois economists the economic anatomy of the classes. What I did 
that was new was to prove: (1) that the <I>existence of classes </I>is only bound up with <I>particular</I>, 
historic phases in the
development of production; (2) that the class struggle necessarily leads to the <I>dictatorship 
of the proletariat</I>; (3) that this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition to the 
<I>abolition of all classes and to a classless
society</I>.<sup class="anote"><a href="#18" name="18b">18)</a></sup></P>

<P>So he saw the chief thing to be the doctrine of proletarian dictatorship and the transition to classless communist society. The scientific analysis of the movement of capitalism is only a 
means of foreseeing, and foresight
itself is only a means for practical activity. Lenin remarks splendidly in one place that Marx gives examples &quot;of materialism 
examining society in motion, and moreover not merely from that aspect of its motion which faces 
backward&quot;. He grasps the
coming, in order the more energetically, fully, actively and successfully to &quot;change the world&quot;. His analysis of capitalist society is great and incomparable. His forecasts are justified by 
the whole consequent course of
historical development, just as the teaching on proletarian dictatorship and the transition to classless communist society founded on that analysis is also completely justified by the whole
consequent course of historical
development.</P>
