<H3>Chapter 10: Reproduction of the Processes of Concentration and Centralisation of Capital on a World Scale</H3>




<P CLASS="pagenoteb">1. CONCENTRATION OF CAPITAL. CONCENTRATION OF CAPITAL IN SINGLE ENTERPRISES. CONCENTRATION OF CAPITAL IN TRUSTS. CONCENTRATION OF CAPITAL IN ORGANISED &quot;NATIONAL ECONOMIES&quot; (&quot;STATE CAPITALIST TRUSTS&quot;). 2. CENTRALISATION OF CAPITAL. STRUGGLE BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL ENTERPRISES; STRUGGLE BETWEEN TRUSTS; STRUGGLE BETWEEN &quot;STATE CAPITALIST TRUSTS.&quot; 3. PRESENT-DAY CAPITALIST EXPANSION AS A CASE OF CAPITAL CENTRALISATION. ABSORPTION OF SIMILAR STRUCTURES (HORIZONTAL CENTRALISATION). ABSORPTION OF AGRARIAN REGIONS (VERTICAL CENTRALISATION. COMBINE.)</P>

<P>The two most important processes of capitalist development are concentration and
centralisation of capital; they are often confused but must be clearly distinguished.
This is how Marx defines these terms:</P>

<P class="quote">Every individual capital [he says] is a larger or smaller concentration of the means of production, giving command over a larger or smaller army of workers. Every
accumulation becomes the means of new accumulation. As the mass of wealth
which functions as capital increases, there goes on an increasing concentration of
that wealth in the hands of individual capitalists, with a resultant widening of the
basis of large-scale production and of the specific methods of capitalist
production. The growth of social capital is affected by the growth of many
individual capitals.... Two points characterise this kind of concentration <I>which is
directly dependant upon accumulation, or, gather, identical with it</I> [italics ours - <I>N.B.</I>]. First of all, the increasing concentration of the social means of production
into the hands of individual capitals, is, other conditions being equal, restricted by
the extent of social wealth. In the second place, the part of social capital domiciled
in each particular sphere of production is divided among many capitalists, who
face one another as independent commodity producers competing one with
another.... This splitting up of social capital into a number of individual capitals,
or the repulsion of its fragments one by another, [Marx here has in mind the division of property, etc. - <I>N.B.</I>], is counteracted by their attraction. The latter is not simply a concentration of the means of production and command over labour identical with accumulation.
It is the concentration of already formed capitals, the destruction of their
individual independence, the expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, the
transformation of many small capitals into a few large ones. This process is
distinguished from simple accumulation by this, that it involves nothing more than
a change in the distribution of capitals that already exist and are already at work....Capital aggregates into great masses in one hand because, elsewhere, it is taken out of my hands. Here we have genuine centralisation in contradistinction to accumulation and concentration.<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup></P>

<P>To summarise. By concentration we understand the increase of capital that is due to the capitalisation of the surplus value produced by that capital; under centralisation we understand the joining together of various individual capital units which thus form a new larger unit. Concentration and centralisation of capital pass through various phases of development, which we must now survey. Let us note in passing that both processes, concentration and centralisation, influence one another. A great concentration of capital accelerates the absorption of small-scale enterprises by large-scale ones; conversely, centralisation aids the increase of individual capital units and so accelerates the process of concentration.</P>

<P>The primary form in the process of concentration is concentration of capital in an
individual enterprise. This form predominated up to the last quarter of the
nineteenth century. The accumulation of social capital is here expressed in the
accumulation of the capital of individual entrepreneurs who oppose one another as
competitors. The development of joint stock companies, which made it possible to
use the capital of a considerable number of individual entrepreneurs, and which
radically undermined the principle of individual ownership of enterprises, created the prerequisites for large monopolistic associations of
entrepreneurs. Concentration of capital assumed a new form here, namely, the
form of <I>concentration in trusts</I>. Capital accumulation no more increased the capital
of individual producers; it turned into a means of increasing the capi tal of entrepreneurs' organisations. The tempo of accumulation increased to an extraordinary degree. Huge masses of surplus value, far exceeding the needs of an insignificant group of
capitalists, are converted into capital to begin a new cycle. But
even here the development does not stop. The individual production
branches are in various ways knit together into one collective body,
organised on a large scale. Finance capital seizes the entire country
in an iron grip. &quot;National economy&quot; turns into one gigantic
combined trust whose partners are the financial groups and the
state. Such formations we call state capitalist trusts. Of course, the
latter formations cannot be identified with the structure of a trust in
the proper sense of the word; a trust proper is a, much more
centralised and less anarchic organisation. To a certain degree,
however, particularly in comparison with the preceding phase of
capitalism, the economically developed states have already
advanced far towards a situation where they can be looked upon
as big trust-like organisations or, as we have termed them, state
capitalist trusts. We may, therefore, speak at present about the
concentration of capital in state capitalist trusts as component parts
of a much larger socio-economic entity, world economy.</P>

<P>It is true that the early economists already spoke of the
&quot;accumulation of capital in a country,&quot; this being one of the
favourite subjects, as witnessed, for instance, by the title of Adam
Smith's principal book. At that time, however, the expression had a
considerably different meaning, for &quot;national economy,&quot; or the
&quot;economy of a country&quot; by no means represented a collective
capitalist enterprise, a single gigantic combined trust-a form largely
adopted at present by the foremost capitalist countries.</P>

<P>Parallel with the change in the forms of concentration went the
change in the forms of centralisation. Where individual ownership
of enterprises prevailed, individual capitalists opposed one another
in the competitive struggle. At that time &quot;national economy&quot; and
&quot;world economy&quot; were only sum totals of those comparatively
small units that were interconnected by the circulation of
commodities and competed with each other mainly within &quot;national&quot;
limits. The centralisation process consisted in small capitalists being absorbed by large ones, in the
growth of large-scale, individually owned, enterprises. With the
growth of large-scale enterprises the extensive character of
competition (within given territorial limits) decreased more and
more; the number of competitors shrank with the growth of
centralisation. On the other hand, the intensity of the competition
increased tremendously, for the smaller number of larger
enterprises began to place on the market volumes of commodities
unknown in former times. Concentration and centralisation of
capital finally brought about the formation of trusts. Competition
rose to a still higher stage. Where formerly many individually
owned enterprises competed with one another, there appeared the
most stubborn competition between a few gigantic capitalist
combines pursuing a complicated and, to a considerable degree,
calculated policy. There finally comes a time when competition
ceases in an entire branch of production. But the war for dividing
up the surplus value between the syndicates of the various
branches becomes fiercer; organisations producing manufactured
goods arise against syndicates producing raw materials, and vice
versa. The centralisation process proceeds apace. Combines in
industry and banking syndicates unite the entire &quot;national&quot;
production, which assumes the form of a company of companies,
thus becoming a state capitalist trust. Competition reaches the
highest, the last conceivable state of development. It is now the
competition of state capitalist trusts in the world market.
Competition is reduced to a minimum within the boundaries of
&quot;national&quot; economies, only to flare up in colossal proportions, such
as would net have been possible in any of the preceding historic
epochs. Of course, there existed competition between &quot;national
economies,&quot; <I>i.e.</I>, between their ruling classes, also in former times.
That competition, however, was of an entirely different nature, for
the inner structure of those &quot;national economies&quot; was entirely
different. &quot;National economy&quot; did not appear on the arena of the
world market as a homogeneous organised whole endowed with
unusual economic strength; inside of it absolutely free competition
reigned. On the other hand, competition in the world market was
extremely weak. All this looks entirely different now in the
epoch of finance capitalism, when the centre of gravity is shifted to
the competition of gigantic, consolidated, and organised economic
bodies possessed of a colossal fighting capacity in the world
tournament of &quot;nations.&quot; Here competition holds its orgies on the
greatest possible scale, and together with this there goes on a
change and a shift to a higher phase in the process of capital
centralisation. The absorption of small capital units by large ones,
the absorption of weak trusts, the absorption even of large trusts by
larger ones is relegated to the rear, and looks like child's play
compared with the absorption of whole countries that are being
forcibly torn away from their economic centres and included in the
economic system of the victorious &quot;nation.&quot; Imperialist annexation
is only a case of the general capitalist tendency towards
centralisation of capital, a case of its centralisation on that
maximum scale which corresponds to the competition of state
capitalist trusts. The arena of this combat is world economy; its
economic and political limits are a world trust, a single world state
obedient to the finance capital of the victors who assimilate all the
rest - an ideal of which even the hottest heads of former epochs
never dreamed.</P>

<P>One may distinguish two kinds of centralisation: the one where an
economic unit absorbs another unit of the same kind, and the one
which we term vertical centralisation, where an economic unit
absorbs another of a different kind. In the latter case we have
&quot;economic supplement&quot; or combination. At present, when the
competition and the centralisation of capital are being reproduced
on a world scale, we find the same two types. When one country,
one state capitalist trust, absorbs another, a weaker one possessed
of comparatively the same economic structure, we have a
horizontal centralisation of capital. Where, however, the state
capitalist trust includes an economically supplementary unit, an
agrarian country for instance, we have the formation of a combine.
Substantially the same contradictions and the same moving forces
are reflected here as within the limits of &quot;national economies&quot;; to
be specific, the rise of prices of raw materials leads to the rise of
combined enterprises. Thus on the higher stage of the
struggle there is reproduced the same contradiction between the
various branches, but on a considerably wider scale.</P>

<P>The actual process of development of modern world economy
knows both these forms. An example of a horizontal imperialist
annexation is the seizure of Belgium by Germany; an example of
vertical annexation is the seizure of Egypt by England. None the
less, it is customary to reduce imperialism to colonial conquests
alone. This entirely erroneous conception formerly found some
justification in the fact that the bourgeoisie, following the line of
least resistance, tended to widen its territory by the seizure of free
lands that offered little resistance. Now, however, the time has
come for a fundamental redivision. Just as trusts competing with
one another within the boundaries of a state first grow at the
expense of &quot;third persons,&quot; of outsiders, and only after having
destroyed the intermediary groupings, thrust themselves against
one another with particular ferocity, so the competitive struggle
between state capitalist trusts first expresses itself in a struggle for
free lands, for the <I>jus primi occupantis</I>, then it stages a redivision of
colonies, and finally, when the struggle becomes more intense,
even the territory of the home country is drawn into the process of
redivision. Here, too, development proceeds along the line of least
resistance, and the weakest state capitalist trusts first disappear
from the face of the earth. This is the general law of capitalist
production, which can fall only with the fall of capitalist production
itself.</P>
