<p>World economy, as we have seen above, represents a complex network of economic connections of the most diverse nature; the basis of this are production relations on a world scale.
Economic connections uniting a great number of individual economies are found
to become more numerous and more frequent as we proceed, within the framework
of world economy, to analyse &quot;national&quot; economies, <em>i.e.</em>, economic
connections existing within the boundaries of individual states. There is
nothing mysterious about this; we must not attribute that fact to an alleged
creative role of the &quot;state principle&quot; that is supposed to create
from within itself special forms of national economic existence; neither is
there a predestined harmony between society and state. The matter has a much
simpler explanation. The fact is that the very foundation of modern states as
definite political entities was caused by economic needs and requirements. The
state grew on the economic foundation; it was only an expression of economic
connections; state ties appeared only as an expression of economic ties. Like
all living forms, &quot;national economy&quot; was, and is, engaged in a
continuous process of internal regeneration; molecular movements going on
parallel with the growth of productive forces, were continually changing the
position of individual &quot;national&quot; economic bodies in their relation
to each other, <em>i.e.</em>, they influenced the interrelations of the individual parts
of the growing world economy. Our time produces highly significant relations.
The destruction, from top to bottom, of old, conservative, economic forms that
was begun with the initial stages of capitalism, has triumphed all along the
line. At the same time, however, this &quot;organic&quot; elimination of weak
competitors inside the framework of &quot;national economies&quot; (the ruin of
artisanship, the disappearance of intermediary forms, the growth of large&#8209;scale
production, etc.) is now being superseded by the &quot;critical&quot; period of
a sharpening struggle among stupendous opponents on the world market. The
causes of this phenomenon must be sought first of all in the internal changes
that have taken place in the structure of &quot;national capitalisms,&quot;
causing a revolution in their mutual relations.</p>

<p>Those changes appear, first of all, as the formation and the unusually
rapid spread of capitalist monopoly organisations: cartels, syndicates, trusts,
bank syndicates.<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup> We have seen above how strong this process is in the
international sphere. It is immeasurably greater within the framework of
&quot;national economies.&quot; As we shall see below, the &quot;national&quot;
carteling of industry serves as one of the most potent factors making for the
national interdependence of capital.</p>

<p>The process of the formation of capitalist
monopolies is, logically and historically, a continuation of the
process of concentration and centralisation of capital. Just as the free
competition of artisans, arising over the bones of feudal monopoly, led to the
accumulation of the means of productions in the hands of the class of
capitalists as their monopoly possession, so free competition inside of the
class of capitalists is being more and more limited by restrictions and by the
formation of giant economies monopolising the entire &quot;national&quot;
market. Such giant economies must by no means be considered
&quot;abnormal&quot; or &quot;artificial&quot; phenomena springing up in
consequence of state aid like tariffs, freight rates, premiums, subsidies, or
governmental orders, etc. True, all these &quot;causes&quot; have materially
accelerated the process of monopolisation, but they have never been, and are
not, its prime condition. What is really a <em>conditio sine qua non</em>is
a certain degree of concentration
of production. This is why, generally speaking, monopoly organisations are the
strongest where productive forces are most developed. A particularly important
part was played in this respect by joint stock companies, a form that has
immensely facilitated the investment of capital in production and has created
enterprises of hitherto unknown dimensions. It is therefore most natural that
leadership in the cartel movement belongs to the two countries that have forged
ahead with feverish rapidity to the first places in the world market, namely,
the United States and Germany.</p>

<p>The United States represents a classic example of modern economic
development, and it is here that the most centralised form of monopoly
organisations, the &quot;trusts,&quot; have become deeply rooted. The following
table gives a clear idea of the tremendous economic power of the trusts&#8209;of
the largest trusts in particular&#8209;as well as of their growth.</p>

<p>According to Moody, the growth of trusts between 1904 and 1908 is
expressed in the figures in the table below.</p>

<p>According to Poor's Manual
of Corporations and Poor's Manual of Railroads for 1910 the total equals 333
billion dollars.<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">3)</a></sup> By 1910 the share of the trusts in &quot;'national&quot;
production was already very large. They produced 50 per cent of the textiles,
54 per cent of the glassware, 60 per cent of the cotton and printed goods, 62
per gent of the foodstuffs, 72 per cent of the alcoholic beverages, 77 per cent
of the metal products (exclusive of iron and steel), 81 per cent of the
chemicals, 84 per cent of the iron and steel.<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">4)</a></sup> Since then their share in the
national production has grown considerably, for the process of concentration
and centralisation of capital in the United States proceeds with magic
rapidity.</p>

<p class="quote">Only a few students of the most recent development of the finance
organisation of large&#8209;scale production and its commercial branches can
have an idea of the gigantic concentration, and of its power over combined and
differentiated large&#8209;scale enterprises, which often include productive
forces reaching beyond the boundaries of an individual national economy.<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">5)</a></sup></p>

<p>Within the framework of the present study it is impossible even to
enumerate the chief trusts operating in the various countries. Let it be noted
only that at the head of all of them are the two most colossal trusts, the
Standard Oil Company and the United States Steel Corporation, respectively
representing the two financial groups of Rockefeller and Morgan.</p>

<p>The movement of big capital in Germany proceeds along identical lines.
By 1905 there were, according to official statistics, 385 cartels in the most
diverse branches of production.<sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">6)</a></sup> The well&#8209;known theoretician and leader
of the cartel movement in Germany, Dr. Tschierschky, estimates the number of
cartels in Germany as between 550 and 600.<sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">7)</a></sup> The greatest among them are: the
Rhine&#8209;Westphalian Coal Syndicate (Rheinisch&#8209;Westfälisches
Kohlensyndikat) and the Steel Syndicate (Stahlwerksverband). According to
Raffalovich, the former produced in 1909, in the Dortsmund region, 85 million
tons of coal, whereas the production of all the &quot;outsiders&quot; amounted
to 4,200,000 tons only (4.9 per cent).<sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">8)</a></sup> By January, 1913, the production of
syndicate coal amounted to 92.6 per cent of the total production in the Ruhr
region and 54 per cent of the total national production. By that time the steel
syndicate had increased its production to 43&#8209;44 per cent of the national
production. The sugar refining trust, embracing 47 enterprises, produces a very
large share of the total output (70 per cent of the sugar consumed in the
country, and 80 per cent of the sugar exported abroad).<sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">9)</a></sup> The electric trust
(an Interessengemeinschaft between two trusts: the Siemens&#8209;Schuckert and
the A&#8209;E&#8209;G) control 40 per cent of all the power produced.</p>

<p>The monopoly organisations in other countries are less formidable, but
taken in absolute numbers, without comparison with the United States or
Germany, the syndication process is considerable everywhere.</p>

<p>France numbers a considerable array of syndicates in the metallurgic,
sugar, glass, paper, naphtha, chemical, textile, coal, etc., industries. Of
particular importance are Le Comptoir de Longway which produces 
almost all the cast iron manufactured in
France; the sugar syndicate, which dominates the market almost completely; the
Société Gén6érale des glaces de St. Gobain, which also occupies an almost
absolute monopoly situation, etc; a series of agricultural syndicates, close to
which are the agricultural societies,<sup class="anote"><a href="#10" name="10b">10)</a></sup> must also be noted, as well as the
large combinations in the transportation industry, namely, the three steamship
companies (Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, Compagnie des Messageries
Maritimes, and Compagnie des Chargeurs Réunis), which embrace 41.25 per cent of
the entire merchant marine of France.<sup class="anote"><a href="#11" name="11b">11)</a></sup></p>

<p>In England, where, despite the great concentration of industry, the
monopoly movement for a long while remained very weak due to a number of
reasons, the trustification of industry (&quot;amalgamations,&quot;
&quot;associations,&quot; and &quot;investment trusts&quot;) has made
tremendous strides in the very last few years. Old peculiarities begin to
recede, to become a thing of the past, both as regards the labour movement in
England and as regards the traditional English free trade policy (as we shall
see below, free competition, which is only another name for free trade, is
being relegated more and more to the background in the realm of economic
foreign policy). Only ignorance can at present refer to England as a
representative of an entirely different economic type. Here are a few cases
that may serve as an example: the Association of Portland Cement Manufacturers,
producing 89 per cent of the national output; the steel trusts; the alcohol
trusts; the wallpaper trusts producing 98 per cent of all the wallpaper and
other decorative materials; the cable trusts (the Cablemakers' Association,
producing about 90 per cent of the national output); the salt trust (Salt
Union, about 90 per cent); the Fine Cotton Spinners' and Doublers' Trust
(practically controlling the entire production of England); the dyers' and
bleachers' trust (Bleachers' Association and Dyers' Association, about 90 per
cent); the Imperial Tobacco Company (about one&#8209;half of the national
production), etc.<sup class="anote"><a href="#12" name="12b">12)</a></sup></p>

<p>In Austria we find among the large cartels: the coal syndicate of
Bohemia (with 90 per cent of all the production of Austria); the brick
syndicate with a yearly output amounting to 400 million crowns (the production
of outsiders amounting only to 40 million crowns); the iron syndicate; the
naphtha syndicate (in Galicia, with 40 per cent of the national output); the
sugar, glass, paper, textiles, and other syndicates.</p>

<p>Even in such a backward country as Russia, with such a paucity of
capital, the number of higher type syndicates and trusts, according to Mr.
Goldstein, exceeds 100. There are, besides, a number of local agreements of a
less developed type. Let us note the largest.<sup class="anote"><a href="#13" name="13b">13)</a></sup> In the coal industry the
Produgol Trust (producing 60 per cent of the coal dug in the Don area); 19
syndicates in the iron industry, among which the most prominent are Prodameta
(iron implements trusts, controlling SS&#8209;93 per cent of national production),
the Krovlia (sheet iron trust, with 60 per cent of the national output), and
Prodvagon (railroad car trust, embracing 14 out of the 16 car construction
plants); in the oil industry almost the entire production is concentrated in
the hands of four companies, mutually interlocked; noteworthy are also the
copper syndicate (90 per cent), the sugar syndicate (100 per cent), the textile
manufacturers' agreements, the tobacco trust (57&#8209;58 per cent), the match
syndicate, etc.</p>

<p>The syndicates show a high degree of development in Belgium; but even
such young countries as Japan have also entered the road of building capitalist
monopolies. The old production forms of capitalism have thus undergone a
radical change. According to F. Laur's figures out of 500 billion francs
invested in the industrial enterprises of all the countries of the world, as 255
billions, i.e., almost one&#8209;half, aye invested in production organised in
cartels and trusts</em>. (This capital is distributed in the various countries as
follows: United States, 200 billion francs; Germany, 50 billion francs; France,
30 billion francs; Austria&#8209;Hungary, 25 billion francs, etc.&#8209;all
these figures being estimated below the actual ones).<sup class="anote"><a href="#14" name="14b">14)</a></sup> This indicates a
complete transformation of the old interrelation of 
forces inside every country, which could not fail to entail
radical changes in the interrelation of the countries themselves.</p>

<p>The process, however, is not limited to
individual branches of production. There is going on a continuous process of
binding together the various branches of production, a process of transforming
them into one single organisation. This expresses itself, first of all, in the
form of combined enterprises, <em>i.e.</em>, enterprises combining the production of raw
materials and manufactured goods, the production of manufactured goods with
that of unfinished products, etc., which process can and does absorb the most
diverse branches of production, since under the prevailing division of labour
in our times every branch depends upon the other to a larger or lesser degree,
directly or indirectly. For instance, when a trust produces outside of its main
product also a by&#8209;product, it shows a tendency to monopolise this latter
branch of production, which in turn serves as a stimulus to monopolising the
production of goods used as substitutes for the by&#8209;product; then comes
the tendency to monopolise the production of raw materials used for the
production of the substitute, and so on and so forth. Thus combinations are
created which, at first glance, seem astounding, like iron and cement, oil and
glucose, etc.<sup class="anote"><a href="#15" name="15b">15)</a></sup> This vertical concentration and centralisation of production,
in contradistinction to the horizontal centralisation which is going on within
one branch of production, signifies, on the one hand, a diminution of the
social division of labour, since it combines in one enterprise the labour that
was previously divided among several enterprises; on the other hand, it
stimulates the division of labour inside of the new production unit. The entire
process, taken on a social scale, tends to turn the entire &quot;national&quot;
economy into a single combined enterprise with an organisation connection
between all the branches of production. The same process is going on with great
rapidity in another way: banking capital penetrates industry, and capital turns
into finance capital.</p>

<p>We have seen in the preceding chapters what tremendous significance is
attached to participation in and financing of industrial enterprises. The
latter is one of the functions of modern banks.</p>

<p class="quote">An increasingly large section of industrial capital does not belong to
the industrialists who apply it. The right to manipulate the capital is
obtained by them only through the bank which, in relation to them, appears as
the owner of that capital. On the other hand, the bank is compelled to place an
ever growing part of its capital in industry. In this way the bank becomes to
an ever increasing degree an industrial capitalist. Bank capital, <em>i.e.</em>, capital
in money form, which has <em>thus been in reality transformed into industrial
capital, I call finance capital</em>.<sup class="anote"><a href="#16" name="16b">16)</a></sup></p>

<p>Thus by means of various forms of credit, by owning stocks and bonds,
and by directly promoting enterprises, banking capital appears in the role of
an organiser of industry. This organisation of the combined production of a
whole country is the stronger, the greater; on the one hand, the concentration
of industry, on the other, the concentration of banking. The latter has of late
assumed colossal proportions. Here are a few examples. In Germany an actual
monopoly of banking is in the hands of six banks: the Deutsche Bank, the
Diskontogesellschaft, the Darmstädter Bank, the Dresdner Bank, the Berliner
Handelsgesellschaft, and the Schaffhausenscher Bankverein; the capital of those
banks amounted in 1910 to 1,122.6 million marks.<sup class="anote"><a href="#17" name="17b">17)</a></sup> The growth of the power of
those banks may be seen from the growth of the number of their institutions
inside of Germany (counting the main banks and their branches, deposit banks
and currency exchange offices, also their &quot;participation&quot; in the
German stock company banks): in 1895, 42; in 1896, 48; in 1900, So; in 1902,
127; in 1905, 194; in 1911, 450.<sup class="anote"><a href="#18" name="18b">18)</a></sup>
Within 16 years the number of those institutions grew eleven times.</p>

<p>In the United States there
are only two banks of such importance: The National City Bank (the Rockefeller
firm) and the National Bank of Commerce (the Morgan firm). Those two banks hold
sway over countless industrial undertakings and banks, intertwined in all sorts
of ways. &quot;The size of the bank operations of the Rockefeller and Morgan
groups may be approximately
judged by the fact that, in 1908, the first group counted among its clients,
and held reserves of, 3,350, and the latter of 2,757, national, state and other
banks.&quot; No new trust can be founded without the aid of these banks, they
being a &quot;monopoly of monopoly making.<sup class="anote"><a href="#19" name="19b">19)</a></sup></p>

<p>Corresponding to this unique economic tie between the various
production branches and the banks, is a special form of higher management of
both. As a matter of fact, the representatives of the industrialists manage the
banks, and vice versa. Jeidels is authority for the statement that, in 1903,
the six above mentioned German banks held 751 seats in the supervising
councils of the industrial stock companies.<sup class="anote"><a href="#20" name="20b">20)</a></sup> Conversely, there were (in
December, 1910) 51 representatives of industry in the supervising councils of
the banks.<sup class="anote"><a href="#21" name="21b">21)</a></sup></p>

<p>As to America, the following fact is highly characteristic. From a list
submitted to the Senate during the debate over the bill for the improvement of
the banking business (La Follette's commission in 1908), it was evident that 89
persons held over 2,000 directors' posts in various industrial, transportation,
and other companies, all of which companies were directly or indirectly
controlled by Morgan and Rockefeller.</p>

<p>Mention must be made here also of the important part played by state
and communal enterprises, which enter into the general system of &quot;national
economy.&quot; Among state enterprises we find, first of all, mining (in
Germany, e.g., out of 309 coal mines with an output of 149 million tons, 27
mines with an output of 20.5 million tons belonged to the state in agog; the
total value of state production amounted to 235 million marks; salt mines and
others also belong to this category; the gross income from all state
enterprises of Germany in 1910 amounted to 349 million marks, while the net
income was 25 million marks);<sup class="anote"><a href="#22" name="22b">22)</a></sup> next to mining are state railroads (only in
England, and only prior to the war, were the railroads exclusively in the hands
of private owners); then the post office, the telegraph, etc., also forestry.
Among communal enterprises of great economical importance are mainly the water
system, the gas system, and the electric constructions, with all their
ramifications.<sup class="anote"><a href="#23" name="23b">23)</a></sup> The powerful state banks also form part of this system. The
interrelation between those &quot;public&quot; enterprises and the enterprises
of a purely private character assumes various forms; the economic connections,
in general, are numerous and variegated, and credit is not the least among
them. Very close relations arise on the basis of the so&#8209;called mixed
system (<em>gemischte Unternehmungen</em>) where a certain enterprise is composed of
both &quot;public&quot; and private elements (participation of large&#8209;scale,
usually monopolistic, firms)&#8209;a phenomenon not infrequent in the realm of
communal economy. The example of the German Empire Bank (<em>Reichsbank</em>) is of
particular interest. This bank, whose part in the economic life of Germany is
tremendous, appears so closely connected with &quot;private economy&quot; that
there is an unsettled dispute going on as to whether it is a stock company or a
state institution, whether it is subject to the laws governing private or
public undertakings.<sup class="anote"><a href="#24" name="24b">24)</a></sup></p>

<p>All parts of this
considerably organised system, cartels, banks, state enterprises, are in the
process of growing together; the process is becoming ever faster with the
growth of capitalist concentration; the formation of cartels and combines
creates forthwith a community of interest among the financing banks; on the
other hand, banks are interested in checking competition between enterprises
financed by them; similarly, every understanding between the banks helps to tie
together the industrial groups; state enterprises also become ever more
dependent upon large&#8209;scale financial&#8209;industrial formations, and
vice versa. Thus various spheres of the concentration and organisation process
stimulate each other, creating a very strong tendency towards transforming the
entire national economy <em>into one gigantic combined enterprise under the tutelage
of the financial kings and the capitalist state, an enterprise which
monopolises the national market and forms the prerequisite for organised
production on a higher noncapitalist level</em>.</p>

<p>It follows that world capitalism, the world system of production,
assumes in our times the following aspect: a few consolidated, organised
economic bodies (&quot;the great civilised powers&quot;) on the one hand, and a
periphery of undeveloped countries with a semi&#8209;agrarian or agrarian
system on the other. The organisation process (which, parenthetically speaking,
is by no means the aim or the motive power of the capitalist gentlemen, as
their ideologists assert, but is the objective result of their seeking to
obtain a maximum of profit) tends to overstep the &quot;national&quot;
boundaries. But it finds very substantial obstacles on this road. First, it is
much easier to overcome competition on a &quot;national&quot; scale than on a
world scale (international agreements usually arise on the basis of already
existing &quot;national&quot; monopolies); second, the existing differences of
economic structure and consequently of production&#8209;costs make agreements
disadvantageous for the advanced &quot;national&quot; groups; third, the ties
of unity with the state and its boundaries are in themselves an ever growing
monopoly which guarantees additional profits. Among the factors of the latter
category, let us first of all turn our attention to the tariff policy.</p>

<p>The character of the tariff policy has undergone a total
transformation. Old&#8209;time customs duties aimed at defence; presentday
customs duties aim at aggression; old&#8209;time tariffs were secured for
commodities whose production was so little developed at home that they could
not stand competition on the world market; in our days &quot;protection&quot;
is accorded to those branches of production which are most capable of
withstanding competition.</p>

<p>Friedrich List, that apostle of protectionism, in his <em>National System
of Political Economy</em>, dealt with <em>educational</em> customs duties, looking upon them
as upon a temporary measure.</p>

<p class="quote">We shall speak here [he says] of tariff legislation only as a means to
<em>educate</em> industry.... Protectionist measures can be justified only as a
means of encouraging and protecting the home manufacturing power, and only
among those nations which are...called to secure for themselves a position
equal to that of the foremost agricultural, manufacturing, and trading nations,
the great maritime and continental powers.<sup class="anote"><a href="#25" name="25b">25)</a></sup></p>

<p>Nothing of the kind exists at present despite the assertions of some
bourgeois scholars. Present&#8209;day &quot;high protectionism&quot; is nothing
but the economic policy of the cartels as formulated by the state; present&#8209;day
customs duties are cartel duties, <em>i.e.</em>, they are a means in the hands of the
cartels for obtaining additional profit, for it is quite obvious that if
competition is eliminated or reduced to a minimum in the home market, the
&quot;producers&quot; can raise the prices inside the home market, adding an
increment equal to the tariff. This additional profit makes it possible to sell
commodities on the world market below the cost of production, to practice
<em>dumping</em>, which is the peculiar export policy of the cartels. This explains the
apparently strange phenomenon that present&#8209;day tariffs
&quot;protect&quot; also export industries. Already Engels saw clearly the
connection existing between the growth of cartels on the one hand and modern
tariffs with their specific characteristics on the other.</p>

<p class="quote">The fact [he says] that the rapidly and enormously growing productive
forces grow beyond the control of the laws of the capitalist mode of exchanging
commodities, inside of which they are supposed to move, impresses itself
nowadays more and more even on the minds of the capitalists. This is shown
especially by two symptoms. First, by the new and general mania for a
protective tariff, which differs from the old protectionism especially by the
fact that now the articles which are <em>capable of being exported</em> are the best
protected. In the second place, it is shown by the <em>trusts</em> of manufacturers of
whole spheres of production.<sup class="anote"><a href="#26" name="26b">26)</a></sup></p>

<p>It was in our time that a
gigantic stride forward was made in this direction. Consolidated industry, led
by the heavy industries, appears as
the most ardent advocate of a high tariff system, for the higher the tariff the
greater is the additional profit, the easier is it to conquer new markets, and
the greater is the general volume of profits obtained. The limit is reached
only when the demand shrinks to such an extent that the loss is no longer
compensated by the high prices. Inside of these limitations, however, the tendency
to higher tariffs is an undisputed fact.</p>

<p>When we now survey world economy as a whole, there appears before our
eyes the following picture. Cartel tariffs and the dumping system practiced by
the foremost countries provoke resistance on the part of the backward countries
which raise their defencive tariffs;<sup class="anote"><a href="#27" name="27b">27)</a></sup> on the other hand the raising of
tariffs by the backward countries serves as a further stimulus to raise the
cartel duties that make dumping easier. Needless to say that the same action
and counteraction take place both among the foremost countries in relation to
each other and among backward countries in their mutual relations. This endless
screw, perpetually applied by the growth of cartel organisations, has called
forth the &quot;tariff mania&quot; of which Engels spoke, and which has grown
even more pronounced in our days.</p>

<p>From the end of the seventies of the last century, there can be
observed in all countries distinguished by modern development a turn from free
trade to a tariff system. The latter, rapidly evolving from a system supposed
to &quot;educate&quot; industry into a system safeguarding the cartels, finally
becomes the high protectionism of our days.</p>

<p>In Germany this turn takes a definite form with the introduction of the
tariff of 1879. Since then we see in Germany a continuous growth of tariff
duties (compare, for instance, the tariff of 1902 with the later tariffs); in
Austria&#8209;Hungary, the turn dates back to 1878; the subsequent tariffs
reveal a similar rising tendency (particularly the tariffs of 1882, 1887, 1906,
etc.); in France, a decisive turn towards protectionism was taken by the
general tariff of 1881 which raised the duties on industrial imports 24 per cent; mention must be made also of the
high protectionist tariff of 1892 (with duties on manufactured goods amounting
to 69 per cent ad valorem, and on agricultural goods, 25 per cent) and its
&quot;revision&quot; in 1910. In Spain, the tariff of 1877 already contains
high duties on industrial goods; particular attention is due the tariff of 1906
with its general increase of duties. In the United States, that classical
country of trusts and of the modern tariff policy, the characteristic features
of protectionism are most salient. An increase of import duties begins in 1883
in connection with the growth of trusts, and reaches 40 per cent of the value
of the imported goods; in 1873&#8209;74, the general duties were 38 per cent;
in 1887, 47.11 per cent; in 1880 (the McKinley Bill) we have a further increase
of the tariff (91 per cent on woolen goods, and even as much as 150 per cent ad
valorem on fine grades of woolens, 40&#8209;80 per cent on metals, etc.);<sup class="anote"><a href="#28" name="28b">28)</a></sup>
there follow later the Dingley Bill (1897), and the Payne Tariff of 1909 which
is one of the striking expressions of high protectionist tendencies. England,
that citadel of free trade, is in a period of transition; there is an
increasing number of ever sharper and more persistent voices demanding fair
trade instead of free trade, <em>i.e.</em>, the introduction of a protectionist system
(see, for instance, the activities of Chamberlain, the Imperial Federation
League, and the United Empire League, etc.). A partial realisation of these
tendencies is the system of preference tariffs between the mother country and
the colonies. Beginning with 1898, Canada exchanged tariff privileges with
England; in 1900, and again in 1906, those tariffs were developed and
&quot;improved&quot;; at present, the privileges amount to 10&#8209;50 per cent
compared with foreign countries. In 1903, the example of Canada was emulated by
the South African colonies (6.25&#8209;25 per cent); in 1903, and again in
1907, New Zealand followed suit; in 1907, the Union of Australian Colonies
joined (5&#8209;10 per cent). At the so&#8209;called Imperial Conferences
(<em>i.e.</em>, conferences of representatives of the colonies and of the British
Government) the note of protectionism becomes more clearly audible each time.
&quot;Only a second&#8209;rate thinker can be in favour of free trade at the
present time and still be optimistic in relation to England,&quot; quoth with
limitless bourgeois conceit the well&#8209;known economist, Aschli, thus
expressing the sentiment of the English ruling classes.<sup class="anote"><a href="#29" name="29b">29)</a></sup></p>

<p>It is well known that the war has brought out all tendencies in the
sharpest form; the tariff policy has become a fact. We must also mention the
unusually high tariffs prevailing in Russia.</p>

<p class="quote">The new policy [says Mr. Kurchinsky] has its origin in the tariff of
1877. 'Since then the country is passing to higher and higher tariffs. In 1877
an increase was effected by levying the duties in gold currency, which at once
raised them 40 per cent. The subsequent years brought further increases in
duties levied upon a great number of commodities, thus developing the
protectionist principles more and more; in 189o all tariffs were raised 20 per
cent. The movement culminates in the extremely protectionist tariff of 1891, in
which the duties levied upon many commodities were increased 100&#8209;300 per
cent <em>and even more</em> above the duties of 1868&quot; [<em>italics ours. N.B.</em>].
&quot;The tariff now in effect was promulgated in 1903 and became effective
February 16, 1906. <em>According to this tariff, many duties were still further
increased</em><sup class="anote"><a href="#30" name="30b">30)</a></sup> [<em>italics ours.
N.B.</em>].</p>

<p>There is not the slightest
doubt that we have before us a general tendency towards protecting the
&quot;national economies&quot; by a high tariff wall. The fact that in
individual cases there may be a lowering of the tariffs or mutual concessions
stipulated in treaties, does not alter the general rule; all such facts are
only exceptions, temporary halts, an armistice in the everlasting war. <em>The
general tendency</em> is in no way disturbed by such facts, since the tendency is
not a simple empirical fact, not an accidental phenomenon, not something
irrelevant as regards modern relations; on the contrary, the very structure of
modern capitalism gives birth to this form of economic policy; together with
that structure it comes into being, and together with it it will fall.</p>

<p>The important economic part now played by tariffs brings about also the
aggressive character of the policy of &quot;modern capitalism.&quot; Indeed, it
is due to the tariffs that monopoly organisations gather additional profit, to
be utilised also as export premiums in the struggle for markets (dumping). This
additional profit may grow, generally speaking, in two ways: first, through
more intensive selling inside the limits of the existing state territory;
second, through the growth of the latter. As regards the former, there is an
obstacle here in the shape of market capacity; one cannot imagine that the big
bourgeoisie would begin to increase the share of the working class, in order
thus to drag itself out of the mire by the hair. Cunning businessmen that they
are, they prefer to follow the other way, the way of enlarging economic
territory. The greater the economic territory, other conditions being equal,
the greater will be the additional profit, the easier it will be to pay export
premiums and to practice dumping, the larger consequently will be the foreign
sales, and the higher the rate of profit. Let us imagine that the volume of
commodities prepared for export is unusually large compared with the volume
that can be absorbed in the home market. Under such conditions it is impossible
to compensate the losses sustained on the foreign market by the monopoly prices
at home: dumping then proves senseless. On the other hand, where there is a
&quot;correct&quot; ratio between internal sales and exports, a maximum of
profits can be squeezed out. This is possible only when the internal market has
a certain capacity, which, assuming demand to be equal, is determined by the size
of the territory included within the tariff walls, <em>i.e.</em>, the state boundaries.
While in former times, in the era of free competition, it was sufficient simply
to penetrate the foreign market with commodities, and such economic occupation
satisfied the capitalists of the exporting country, in our era the interests of
finance capital demand, first of all, an expansion of the home state territory,
<em>i.e.</em>, it dictates a policy of conquest, a pressure of military force, a line of
&quot;imperialist annexation.&quot; It is perfectly clear, however, that
wherever the old liberal system of free trade has been preserved to a
considerable degree in consequence of a special combination of historic
conditions, and where on the other hand the state territory is sufficiently
large, there we have, together with the policy of conquest, a tendency towards
combining the disunited parts of the state organism, towards fusing the
colonies with the metropolis, towards forming a vast single empire with a
general tariff wall. Such is the policy of English imperialism. There is
nothing behind the discussions about the creation of a middle European tariff
alliance but the wish to create a vast economic territory as a monopoly system
allowing more successful competition on the external market. In reality this is
a product of the interests and the ideology of finance capitalism which,
penetrating into all the pores of world economy, creates at the same time an
unusually strong tendency towards secluding the national organisms, towards
economic autarchy as a means of strengthening the monopoly situation of the
respective capitalist groups. Thus, together with the internationalisation of
economy and the internationalisation of capital, there is going on a process of
&quot;national&quot; intertwining of capital, a process of
&quot;nationalising&quot; capital, fraught with the greatest consequences.<sup class="anote"><a href="#31" name="31b">31)</a></sup></p>

<p>This process of &quot;nationalisation&quot; of capital, <em>i.e.</em>, the
creation of homogeneous economic organisms included within state boundaries and
sharply opposing each other, is also stimulated by changes taking place in the
three large spheres of world economy: the sphere of markets for the sale of
commodities, the sphere of markets for raw materials, and the sphere of capital
investment. From these three points of view we must analyse the changes that
are taking place in the conditions of the reproduction of world capital.</p>

We cannot dwell here at length on the differences between those economic forms. For our purposes here, suffice it to be said that we do not see any fundamental difference between cartels and trusts, the trust in our opinion being only a more centralised form of the same phenomenon. All purely formal attempts (compare, for instance, Eduard Heilmann Ueber Individualismus und Solidarismus in der kapitalistischen Konzentration&quot; in Jaffe's <em>Archiv</em>, Bd. 39, Heft 3) at defining the difference between the two forms by saying that the trust is &quot;autocratic&quot; while the syndicate (or cartel) is &quot;democratic,&quot; does not in the least tackle the real issue, the latter being the outcome of the part played by those formations in the national economic life. It does not follow, however, that there is no difference at all between them; on the contrary, from a certain point of view, one must emphasise the difference. At any rate, the difference does not lie on the level of the distinction between the &quot;democratic&quot; and &quot;autocratic&quot; principle. See corresponding chapters in Hilferding's <em>Finanzkapital</em>. Briefly, the difference is that &quot;contrary to the process of trustification, cartelisation by no means signifies the elimination of a conflict of interests between the individual enterprises belonging to the cartel&quot; (Hilferding: &quot;Organisationsmacht and Staatsgewalt,&quot; <em>Neue Zeit</em>, 32.
