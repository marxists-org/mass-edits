STRUGGLE BETWEEN TRUSTS. 3. MEANS OF STRUGGLE BETWEEN STATE CAPITALIST TRUSTS. 4. ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF STATE POWER. 5. MILITARISM. 6. CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF STATE POWER.
</P>


<P>The growth of competition outlined in the last chapter reduces itself
to the fact that the continuous elimination of competition among
smaller economic units calls forth a sharper competition among
large economic units. This process is accompanied by curious
changes in the methods of struggle.</P>

<P>The struggle of individually owned enterprises is usually conducted
by means of low prices; small shops sell cheaper, reducing their
standards of living to a minimum; capitalists strive to reduce the
production costs by improving technique and lowering wages, etc.
When the struggle among individually owned enterprises has been
replaced by the struggle among trusts, the methods of struggle (in
so far as it is conducted in the world market) undergo a certain
change; low prices disappear in the home market, being replaced
by high prices which facilitate the struggle in the world market; the
latter is conducted by means of low prices at the expense of the
high prices paid in the home market. The importance of state
power grows: tariff rates, freight rates are taken advantage of; the
tremendous economic power of the trusts opposing one another,
both in the domestic and in the foreign market, allows them, under
certain conditions, also to apply other methods. When a trust
represents a large combined enterprise, when, for instance, it owns
railroads, steamboats, electric power, etc., thus forming a state
within a state, it can pursue a very complicated policy in regard to
its competitors by regulating railroad rates, water transport rates,
by establishing prices for the use of electric power, etc., etc. Of
still greater significance is the closing of an access to raw materials
and to the sales market, as well as the refusal of credit. The road
to raw materials is usually blocked where there is a combined
cartel. Raw materials produced by enterprises belonging to the
cartel are not sold to outsiders &quot;as a matter of principle&quot; (the socalled 
<I>ausschliesslicher Verbandsverkehr</I>); as to the sales markets, here
the organisations belonging to the cartel agree to buy nothing from
outsiders; moreover, this, under the pressure of the cartel, is made
binding also for &quot;third persons&quot; who usually buy from the cartel (for
which they sometimes receive premiums, reductions, etc.). We
must finally note a lowering of prices and selling at a loss to stifle
the competitor. The trust here declares that &quot;it does not wish to
make profit on the enterprise itself, that the struggle is conducted
only to defeat the competitor, and therefore without any relation to
self-cost. The lower limit is formed, not by the production costs, but
by the cartel's capital power and by the strength of its credit; the
question thus reduces itself to how long its members will be able to
stand a struggle which, for the time being, offers them no gain.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup> In
the home market this method is used to stamp out the final
resistance of the opponent; in the foreign market it appears only as
an increase of dumping. There are, however, still more striking
examples of the struggle. We have in mind the struggle among the
American trusts. The principles applied here went far beyond what
is permissible in organised government: criminal gangs were hired
to destroy railroad tracks, to damage and blow up oil pipes;
incendiarism and murder were practiced; governmental authorities,
including entire judicial bodies, were bribed on a large scale; spies
were maintained in the camp of the competitors, etc., etc. - there is
a plethora of material in this respect in the history of the giant
American combines.<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2)</a></sup></P>

<P>When competition has finally reached its highest stage, when it has
become competition between state capitalist trusts, then
the use of state power, and the possibilities connected with it, begin to play a very
large part. The state apparatus has always served as a tool in the hands of the
ruling classes of its country, and it has always acted as their &quot;defender and
protector&quot; in the world market; at no time, however, did it have the colossal
importance that it has in the epoch of finance capital and imperialist politics. With
the formation of state capitalist trusts, competition is being almost entirely shifted
to foreign countries; obviously, the organs of the struggle that is to be waged
abroad, primarily state power, must therefore grow tremendously. The significance
for capitalism of high tariffs, which increase the fighting capacity of the state
capitalist trust in the world market, must increase still more; the various forms of
&quot;protecting national industry&quot; become more pronounced; state orders are placed
only with &quot;national&quot; firms; income is guaranteed to all sorts of enterprises, which
present great risks but are &quot;useful&quot; from a social point of view; the activities of
&quot;foreigners&quot; are hampered in various ways. (Compare, for instance, the stock
exchange policy of the French government as mentioned in Chapter II). Whenever
a question arises about changing commercial treaties, the state power of the
contracting groups of capitalists appears on .the scene, and the mutual relations of
those states-reduced in the final analysis to the relations between their military
forces-determine the treaty. When a loan is to be granted to one or the other
country, the government, basing itself on military power, secures the highest
possible rate of interest for its nationals, guarantees obligatory orders, stipulates
concessions, struggles against foreign competitors. When the struggle begins for the
exploitation by finance capital of a territory that has not been formally occupied
by anybody, again the military power of the state decides who will possess that
territory. In &quot;peaceful&quot; times the military state apparatus is hidden behind the
scenes where it never stops functioning; in war times it appears on the scene most
directly. The more strained the situation in the world sphere of struggle-and our
epoch is characterised by the greatest intensity of competition between &quot;national&quot;
groups of finance capitalthe oftener an appeal is made to the mailed fist of
state power. The remnants of the old <I>laissez faire, laissez passer </I>
ideology disappear, the epoch of the new &quot;mercantilism,&quot; of imperialism, begins.</P>

<P class="quote">The tendency towards imperialism combines economic phenomena with a great
political power. Everything is organised on a large scale. The free play of economic
forces, not so long ago highly alluring to thinkers and men of affairs, dies out.
There is an ebb and flow of migrating people everywhere, and that process is
supervised by the state. The new economic and social forces require powerful
protection both inside the country and outside of its frontiers; for this purpose the
state creates new organs, great numbers of officials and institutions. State activities
are everywhere enlarged by new functions. Its influence over the facts of home life
and over foreign relations becomes more multifarious. The government would not
decline directly to look after the interests of its people [the term &quot;people&quot; must, of
course, be understood conditionally when reading bourgeois economists - <I>N.B.</I>] at
whatever point of the globe the interests may appear. National economy and
politics are most closely interlocked. The breach between this epoch and the epoch
of old liberalism, with its advocacy of free play, with its doctrine of the harmony
of interests, becomes ever wider. This makes one think that there is more cruelty
and pugnacity in the world as a whole. The world is more united than ever:
everything is contiguous to everything, everything is influenced by everything, at
the same time everybody jostles against everybody else, and deals blows right and
left.<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">3)</a></sup></P>

<P>If state power is generally growing in significance, the growth of its military
organisation, the army and the navy, is particularly striking. The struggle between
state capitalist trusts is decided in the first place by the relation between their
military forces, for the military power of the country is the last resort of the
struggling &quot;national&quot; groups of capitalists. The immensely growing state budget
devotes an ever larger share to &quot;defence purposes,&quot; as militarisation is
euphemistically termed.</P>

<P>The following table illustrates the monstrous growth of military expenditures and
their share in the state budget.</P>

<P>The present military budgets are expressed in the following figures:
the United States (1914), $173,522,804 for the army and
$139,682,186 for the navy, total $313,204,990; France (1913),
983,224,376 francs for the army and 467,176,109 francs for the
navy, total 1,450,400,485 francs (in 1914, 1,717,202,233 francs);
Russia (1913, counting only ordinary expenditures), 581,099,921
rubles for the army and 244,846,500 rubles for the navy, total
825,946,421 rubles; Great Britain (1913-14) 28,220,000 pounds for
the army and 48,809,300 pounds for the navy, total 77,029,300
pounds; Germany (1913, both ordinary and extraordinary
expenditure), 97,845,960 pounds sterling, etc.<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">5)</a></sup></P>

<P>We are now passing through a period when armaments on land, on
water, and in the air are growing with feverish rapidity. Every
improvement in military technique entails a reorganisation and
reconstruction of the military mechanism; every innovation, every
expansion of the military power of one state stimulates all the
others. What we observe here is like the phenomenon we come
across in the sphere of tariff policies where a raise of rates in one
state is immediately reflected in all others, causing a general raise. Of course, here, too,
we have before us only a case of a general principle of
competition, for the military power of the state capitalist trust is the
weapon to be used in its economic struggle. The growth of
armaments, creating as it does a demand for the products of the
metallurgic industry, raises substantially the importance of heavy
industry, particularly the importance of &quot;cannon kings&quot; <I>à 
la</I> Krupp. To say, however, that wars are <I>caused </I> by the ammunition industry,<sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">6)</a></sup> 
would be a cheap assertion. The ammunition industry is by no
means a branch of production existing for itself, it is not an
artificially created evil which in turn calls forth the &quot;battle of
nations.&quot; It ought to be obvious from the foregoing considerations
that armaments are an indispensable attribute of state power, an
attribute that has a very definite function in the struggle among
state capitalist trusts. Capitalist society is unthinkable without
armaments, as it is unthinkable without wars. And just as it is true
that not low prices cause competition but, on the contrary,
competition causes low prices, it is equally true that not the
existence of arms is the prime cause and the moving force in wars
(although wars are obviously impossible without arms) but, on the
contrary, the inevitableness of economic conflicts conditions the
existence of arms. This is why in our times, when economic
conflicts have reached an unusual degree of intensity, we are
witnessing a mad orgy of armaments. Thus the rule of finance
capital implies both imperialism and militarism. In this sense
militarism is no less a typical historic phenomenon than finance
capital itself.</P>

<P>With the growth of the importance of state power, its inner
structure also changes. The state becomes more than ever before
an &quot;executive committee of the ruling classes.&quot; It is true that state
power always reflected the interests of the &quot;upper strata,&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">7)</a></sup> but
inasmuch as the top layer itself was a more or less amorphous mass, the organised state apparatus faced an unorganised class (or classes) whose interests it
embodied. Matters are totally different now. The state apparatus
not only embodies the interests of the ruling classes in general, but
also their collectively expressed will. It faces no more atomised
members of the ruling classes, but their organisations. Thus the
government is <I>de facto </I>transformed into a &quot;committee&quot; elected by
the representatives of entrepreneurs' organisations, and it becomes
the highest guiding force of the state capitalist trust. This is one of
the main causes of the socalled crises of parliamentarism. In
former times parliament served as an arena for the struggle among
various factions of the ruling groups (bourgeoisie and landowners,
various strata of the bourgeoisie among themselves, etc.). Finance
capital has consolidated almost all of their varieties into one &quot;solid
reactionary mass&quot; united in many centralised organisations.
&quot;Democratic&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; sentiments are replaced by open
monarchist tendencies in modern imperialism, which is always in
need of a state dictatorship. Parliament at present serves more as
a decorative institution; it passes upon decisions prepared
beforehand in the businessmen's organisations and gives only
formal sanction to the collective will of the consolidated
bourgeoisie as a whole. A &quot;strong power&quot; has become the ideal of
the modern bourgeois. These sentiments are not &quot;remnants of
feudalism,&quot; as some observers suppose, these are not débris of the
old that have survived in our times. This is an entirely new sociopolitical formation caused by the growth of finance capital. If the
old feudal &quot;policy of blood and iron&quot; was able to serve here,
externally, as a model, this was possible only because the moving
springs of modern economic life drive capital along the road of
aggressive politics and the militarisation of all social life. The best
proof may be found not only in the foreign policies of such
&quot;democratic&quot; countries as England, France, Belgium (note the colonial policy of Belgium), and
the United States, but also in the changes that take place in their
internal policies (militarisation and the growth of monarchism in
France, the increasing attempts at attacking the freedom of labour
organisations in all countries, etc., etc.).</P>

<P>Being a very large shareholder in the state capitalist trust, the
modern state is the highest and all-embracing organisational
culmination of the latter. Hence its colossal, almost monstrous,
power.</P>

<p class="pagenoteb">
<sup class="anote"><a href="#6b" name="6">6)</a></sup> Cf. the above mentioned book by Pavlovich. A more shallow variety of this theory is advanced by Kautsky when he asserts (in his <I>Nationalstaat, imperialistischer Staat and Staatenbund, </I>also in numerous articles in the <I>Neue Zeit</I> during the was) that the war was caused-by mobilisation. This is, indeed, putting things on their heads.</p>

<p class="pagenoteb">
<sup class="anote"><a href="#7b" name="7">7)</a></sup> This is recognised also by a few burgeois sociologists and economists. <I>Franz Oppenheimer, </I>for instance, views the state as the organisation of the classes that own the means of production (in the first place the land) utilised to exploit the masses of the people. His formula to a certain degree approaches the Marxian theory-with modifications that impair its value (placing the emphasis on the &quot;land,&quot; etc.). It is a curious incident that in polemic notes against Oppenheimer such an authority of German sociology and economics as Adolf Wagner admits to a large extent the correctness of Oppenheimer's formula, referring it, however, to the &quot;historic&quot; (!) state.
