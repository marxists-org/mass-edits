<P>The war, which was bound to break out because it had been
prepared by the entire course of events, could not fail to exercise a
colossal influence on world economic life. It has caused a
complete change in every country and in the relations between
countries, in the &quot;national economies&quot; and in world economy.
Together with a truly barbarous squandering of production forces,
with the destruction of the material means of production and of the
living labour power, together with the devitalisation of economy
through monstrous socially harmful expenditures, the war, like a
gigantic crisis, has intensified the fundamental tendencies of
capitalist development; it has hastened to an extraordinary degree
the growth of finance capitalist relations and the centralisation of
capital on a world scale. The centralising character of the present
war (imperialist centralisation) is beyond doubt. First of all, there is
a collapse of independent small states whether of high industrial
development (horizontal concentration and centralisation) or of an
agrarian type (vertical centralisation); the latter have also absorbed
some of the weaker (and similarly backward) formations-which,
however, is comparatively unimportant. The independent existence
of Belgium, a highly developed country with a colonial policy of
its own, is becoming doubtful; the process of a centralising
redivision of territory in the Balkans is perfectly obvious; it is
to be expected that the tangle of colonial possessions in Africa will be straightened out. On
the other hand, we witness a very strong rapprochement (in the
form of a lasting agreement between syndicates) of Germany and
Austria-Hungary. Whatever the actual outcome of the war, it is
already clear (and could have been assumed <I>a priori</I>) that the
political map will be changed in the direction of greater state
homogeneity-this being exactly the way in which the imperialistic
&quot;nationality states&quot; (<I>Nationalitätenstaaten</I>) grow.</P>

<P>If the general tendency of development, only intensified by the
war, consists in a further process of centralisation, the war has
also considerably accelerated the appearance on the world arena
of one of the largest state capitalist trusts, possessed of an
unusually strong internal organisation. We mean the United States
of America.</P>

<P>The war has placed the United States in an unprecedented,
exclusive position. With the cessation of the Russian grain export,
etc., to Europe, the demand for American agrarian products has
increased; on the other hand, there is a stupendous demand for the
products of the war industry of the United States on the part of the
belligerent countries.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup> To the United States is also directed the
quest for credit capital (foreign loans, etc.). Only recently America
was a debtor to Europe; in consequence of the war the situation
changes rapidly: America's debts are being repaid, and in the field
of current accounts and short term credits America is becoming
the creditor of Europe. This growing financial importance of the
United States has another no less significant side to it. The
secondary American states used to import capital from Europe,
mainly from England and France, while the import of capital from
the United States, itself an importer of European capital, was of
little importance. During the war, however, Canada, Argentina,
Panama, Bolivia, and Costa Rica have placed their loans not in Europe but in the United States. &quot;The
American countries have received small sums, but what is characteristic
in this transaction is the fact that the enumerated countries had usually
been clients of the London market. Thus New York has replaced London
for the time of the war and has, as it were, given impetus to the realisation
of the financial section of a Pan-American programme.<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2)</a></sup> The continuation
of the war, the payments for war orders and loans, later the immense
demand for capital in the post-war period (when the reconstruction of
fixed capital will have to be undertaken, etc.) will increase the financial
importance of the United States still more. It will hasten the accumulation
of American capital; it will widen its sphere of influence in the rest of
America, and will rapidly make the United States a prime factor in the
world struggle for markets.<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">3)</a></sup></P>

<P>The example of the United States of America shows how a large state
capitalist trust grows and becomes consolidated, how it absorbs
countries and territories formerly dependent upon Europe.
Simultaneously with the extension of America's world connections, we
witness a highly intensive progress of &quot;national consolidation.&quot; Stronger
still are the &quot;nationalising&quot; tendencies inside of the belligerent groups:
international commodity exchange has been disrupted, the movement of
capital and labour power from one belligerent country to the other has
ceased, nearly all relations have been severed. Within the boundaries of
&quot;national&quot; economy (of which the best example is Germany, for Germany
is cut off from the rest of the world most completely) there goes on a
hasty redistribution of productive forces. This relates not only to the war
industry (it is a well known fact ,that even piano factories in Germany
have been adapted to new tasks, namely, they manufacture shells), but
also to foodstuffs and agriculture in general. Thus the war has unusually
intensified the tendency towards economic autarchy, towards
transforming the &quot;national&quot; economy into a self-sufficient whole, more or
less isolated from world
connections. Does it follow, however, that this tendency will continually
prevail, that world economy will be split up into a number of independent
parts entirely isolated from each other? So, or almost so, does Utopian
imperialism think. The ideologists of imperialism strive towards a state of
affairs where a country produces everything &quot;by itself,&quot; where it &quot;does
not depend upon foreigners,&quot; etc. Let the country acquire the necessary
&quot;economic supplements,&quot; let it secure for itself the sources of raw
material, and the task, they say, is achieved. Such arguments, however,
will not stand the light of criticism. The imperialist gentlemen completely
forget that the annexationist activities they pursue imply the growth of
economic world connections, the expansion of capital and commodity
export, the increase of raw materials' import, and so forth. Thus, from a
certain point of view, the policy of imperialism contains a contradiction:
the imperialist bourgeoisie must, on the one hand, develop world
relations to a maximum (remember the dumping policy of the cartels), on
the other hand, it erects a tariff wall between itself and the world; on the
one hand it exports capital, on the other it cries over foreign supremacy;
in a word, on the one hand it internationalises economic life, on the other
hand it strives with all its might to bottle it up within &quot;national
boundaries.&quot; Still, notwithstanding all obstacles, the basis of
international connections keeps on growing, hence Felix Pinner is
perfectly right when he says:</P>

<P class="quote">Remembering that the unusual expansion of foreign trade took place in
the period of the most decisive nationalist economic policy, we must
assume that the war, and the political sentiments of the great powers
called forth by the war, will destroy international relations as little as this
was hitherto done by the seclusion tendency [<I>Absperrungstendenzen</I>].<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">4)</a></sup></P>

<P>While the war is going on, the disappearance or the weakening of
economic connections in one place is accompanied by their growth in
another. The dominant rôle played by the Germans in Russia has been
discontinued, only to give place to the dominant rôle of the Entente
powers. Nor is this all. We must remember that the regulative principle of capitalist
activity is the accumulation of profits. War is one of the &quot;business
operations&quot; of the modern bourgeois; once it is over, he is as eager
as of yore to establish old connections (not to speak of contraband
operations during the war itself). Capitalist interest imperatively
dictates these steps. The international division of labour, the
difference in natural and social conditions, are an economic prius
which cannot be destroyed, even by the World War. This being so,
there exist definite value relations and, as their consequence,
conditions for the realisation of a maximum of profit in international
transactions. Not economic self-sufficiency, but an intensification
of international relations, accompanied by a simultaneous &quot;national&quot;
consolidation and ripening of new conflicts on the basis of world
competition-such is the road of future evolution.</P>

<P>Thus if the war cannot halt the general development of world
capital, if, on the contrary, it expresses the greatest expansion of
the centralisation process, the war also influences the structure of
individual &quot;national&quot; economies in such a way as to intensify
centralisation within the limits of every &quot;national&quot; body and, while
wasting productive forces on a colossal scale, it organises &quot;national
economy&quot; in that it places it more and more under the combined
rule of finance capital and the state.</P>

<P>In its influence on economic life, the war in many respects recalls
to mind industrial crises, differing from the latter only by a greater
intensity of social convulsions and devastations. Those devastations
express themselves economically, first of all, in the dying out of the
middle strata of the bourgeoisiea process that goes on also during
industrial crises. When markets are lost, entire branches of
production perish; due to the absence of a solvent demand,
connections hitherto firmly rooted are disrupted, the entire credit
system is shaken, etc. Outside of the workers, however, the most
afflicted elements are the middle strata of the bourgeoisie: they go
bankrupt first of all. Large-scale cartel industry, on the contrary,
does not feel unhappy at all. It is easy to gather abundant statistical
material to illustrate the rise in the profits of a whole series of the
largest enterprises, particularly such enterprises
as are close to army deliveries, i.e., in the first place enterprises in
the sphere of heavy industries (so-called &quot;military profits&quot;). In spite
of the fact that the sum total of surplus value produced does not
grow (on the contrary, it is diminishing, due to the fact that a vast
number of hands are diverted to the army), the profits of the largescale bourgeois groups keep on growing. This goes on to a large
extent at the expense of the profits of other, small and uncartelised,
groups of the bourgeoisie. (This increase in profits is, on the other
hand, explained by the rise in the value of paper securities as a
draft on the future.) Where there is a colossal expenditure of
productive forces, where the fixed capital of society is being
&quot;consumed,&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">5)</a></sup> there is evident a shifting of groups and a relative
growth of the large-scale bourgeois categories. This tendency will
not be ended with the war. If the large-scale bourgeoisie defends
and fortifies its position during the war, the post-war gigantic
demands for capital will facilitate the rapid growth of large-scale
banks, and consequently the rapid growth of centralisation and
concentration of capital. A feverish process of healing the wounds
inflicted by the war will ensue: reconstruction of destroyed or
wornout railways, shops and factory plants, machines and
apparatus, rolling stock in the field of transportation, etc.; not the
least among these activities will be the mending and extending of
the military state apparatus. This will increase the demand for
capital to a very high degree, and will strengthen the position of
banking trusts.<sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">6)</a></sup></P>

<P>While the finance capitalist groups are becoming stronger, there
has increased tremendously the interference of the state in
economic life.<sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">7)</a></sup></P>

<P>Under this head comes the formation of state (production and
trade) monopolies; the organisation of so-called &quot;mixed
enterprises&quot; (<I>gemischte Betriebe</I>) where the state or the
municipalities are partners to the enterprise, hand in hand with
private syndicates and trusts; state control over the production
process of private enterprises (obligatory production, regulation of
production methods, etc.): regulation of distribution (compulsory
deliveries and acceptance of goods; organisation of state &quot;central
distribution offices;&quot; state warehouses for raw materials, fuel,
foodstuffs; fixing of prices; bread cards, meat cards, etc.;
prohibition of import and export of goods, etc.); organisation of
state credit; lastly, state organisation of consumption (communal
kitchens).<sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">8)</a></sup></P>

<P>England has established, besides, state insurance of ocean
cargoes, state guarantee of merchants' promissory notes, state
payments of sums belonging to English merchants abroad, when
they cannot be obtained at the moment, etc. Similar measures
have been introduced to a greater or lesser degree by all the
belligerent states.</P>

<P>The &quot;mobilisation of industry,&quot; <I>i.e.,</I> its militarisation, was achieved
with least difficulty where the entrepreneurs' organisations,
cartels, syndicates, and trusts were the strongest. Those
employers' organisations, in whose interests the war is here
undertaken, have placed all their regulating apparatus at the
service of the imperialist state, to whom they are closely related.
They have thus secured the technical-economic possibility of
militarising the economic life, beginning with the direct process of
production and up to the subtleties of credit circulation. Where
industry was organised into cartels, its &quot;mobilisation&quot; assumed
grandiose proportions.</P>

<P>&quot;Large sections of economic life (<I>des Erwerbslebens</I>),&quot; says Mr.
Pinner about Germany, &quot;have for decades been very closely
united, the character of their activities being almost collective; they
have absorbed a large part of the national production and have
placed it under single management: these are the cartels and
trusts.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">9)</a></sup> The aims of industrial mobilisation as well as its
significance have been stressed by the English minister, Mr. Lloyd
George, when he said on June 3, in
Manchester, that the law relative to the defence of the realm gave
the government full power over all the factories; that this law
made it possible for the government to give precedence to work
most urgent; that it gave the government a right to dispose of
every factory, every machine, and that were a difficulty to be
encountered, the ministry was well supplied with arms to make its
orders effective.<sup class="anote"><a href="#10" name="10b">10)</a></sup> Similar measures have been adopted also in
France<sup class="anote"><a href="#11" name="11b">11)</a></sup> and Russia. Aside from direct control of state power over
the production of private enterprises, the war has established a
number of state monopolies. In England the railways have become
state property; Germany has introduced bread, potato, nitrate
monopolies, etc., and has a number of others in prospect (this we
shall treat later); even the coal industry is turning into a &quot;mixed
cartel&quot; where a syndicate co-operates with the government.<sup class="anote"><a href="#12" name="12b">12)</a></sup> In all
these cases the government directly intervenes in the sphere of
production; there is, however, another and very effective
governmental intervention through credit relations. Typical for the
latter is the &quot;financial mobilisation&quot; and related operations in
Germany. Even at the beginning of the war the Reichsbank
operated through a series of other large banks; later its activities in
this respect were greatly augmented. The so-called &quot;loan banks&quot;
(<I>Darlehenskassen</I>),as state institutions dependent upon the
Reichsbank, soon became a very important factor in the realm of
credit.<sup class="anote"><a href="#13" name="13b">13)</a></sup> A tremendous importance is attached to internal military
loans that are being placed among the public directly by the
Reichsbank. Thus the latter, an institution endowed with
exceptional importance in the economic life of Germany even
before the war, has grown tremendously in importance, becoming
as it did a strong centre for the attraction of available portions of
capital. On the other hand, it grows also as an institution that
finances the ever increasing state enterprises and other state
economic organisations. The central banking institute of the
government thus becomes the &quot;golden head&quot; of the entire state capitalist trust.</P>

<P>One must not think that this evolution is confined to Germany alone.
<I>Mutatis mutandis</I> the same process is taking place in all the belligerent
countries (also in the non-belligerent ones, but to a lesser degree). We
must dwell here on one question that seems to us of unusual importance,
namely, on the question of state monopolies and their future.</P>

<p class="pagenote">* The figures quoted in the table are considerably below the actual ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<P>&quot;According to calculations,&quot; said Dr. Helfferich in the Reichstag in
August of this year, &quot;the general cost of this world war for all its
participants must be estimated as equal to some  300  million marks a day,
<I>i.e.</I>, to something like 100 billion marks&quot; (Hear, Hear!). &quot;This is such a
gigantic destruction and shifting of values as world history has never
known.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#14" name="14b">14)</a></sup>  It is needless to say that the figures quoted by the &quot;Marshal of
Finance,&quot; Dr. Helfferich, give no idea as to the real &quot;general cost of the
war,&quot; for they speak only of the immediate war expenditures made by the
states. However, in this connection we are interested in these particular
expenditures, and it will not be out of place to quote a few more detailed
figures concerning military loans. The states are also spending part of
their ordinary income on the war, still the following figures may give
some idea as to the size of the military expenditures.<sup class="anote"><a href="#15" name="15b">15)</a></sup> We use the
computations quoted in No. 44., <I>Vestnik Finansov</I> for 1915. We must
emphasise, however, that the figures here quoted tell us only about the
war loans of the six largest states, whereas the number of states involved
in the war is twelve. Where such unprecedented expenditures are made,
and for no other purpose but for the further destruction of values, the
state debt must grow enormously and the financial organisation of the state is entirely deranged.
The equilibrium is so seriously impaired that additional sources to
replenish the treasury must be looked for, if the colossal expenditures
which will remain even after the war (payment of interest on state loans,
aid for the families of invalids, etc.) are to be covered. In Germany, to take
only one country, the income of the state will have to be increased more
than twice.<sup class="anote"><a href="#16" name="16b">16)</a></sup> It appears impossible to cover the expenses out of the usual
sources of state income (state owned enterprises, direct and indirect
taxation), and the states will be compelled to extend their monopolies.
The leading circles of the bourgeoisie become more and more reconciled
to this idea, for in the final analysis the strength of the state is their own
strength. This is what the &quot;scientific&quot; organ of the German banks has to
say through the mouth of Dr. Felix Pinner:</P>

<P class="quote">The basic differences of opinion which express themselves sharply as to monopolies in general, and one or the other monopoly in particular, have disappeared over night [<I>über Nacht verschwunden</I>], and almost everybody agrees that such proposed monopolies as monopolies on alcohol, kerosene, electricity [more precisely: electric current-N.B.], matches, perhaps even coal, salt, potassium, tobacco, and insurance, are near realisation.<sup class="anote"><a href="#17" name="17b">17)</a></sup></p>

<P>Under such conditions the further expansion of monopoly tendencies is
very probable. Gas production, as we know, is competing with the
production of electric power, consequently a gas monopoly is also
probable. More probable still is the expansion of state power over
enterprises contiguous upon monopolies. When the coal industry is
monopolised by the state, the production of pig iron is affected. Such
examples could be quoted in large numbers. The question then arises as
to whether all such proposals would not remain on paper, whether they
would not encounter the resistance of the bourgeoisie.</P>

<P>We have just indicated the change of tone in relation to state
monopolies. Of course, even now there are sub-classes of the
bourgeoisie, whose interests are clashing in one or the other respect. It is
a fact, however, that economic evolution, fortified at this point by the
war, must and does lead to a situation where the bourgeoisie as a whole
is more tolerant regarding monopolistic interference of the state power.
The basic reason for this change is the ever growing closeness between
state power and the leading spheres of finance capital. State and private
monopoly enterprises merge into one entity within the framework of the
state capitalist trust. The interests of the state and the interests of
finance capital coincide more and more. On the other hand, a maximum of
centralisation and a maximum of state power are required by the fierce
competitive struggle on the world market. The latter two causes on the
one hand, and fiscal consideration on the other, form the main factors
making for state organisation of production within capitalist society.</P>

<P>The bourgeoisie loses nothing from shifting production from one of its
hands into another, since present-day state power is nothing but an
entrepreneurs' company of tremendous power, headed even by the same
persons that occupy the leading positions in the banking and syndicate
offices. The difference is that, under such conditions, the bourgeoisie
receives its income, not from the office of a syndicate, but from the office
of state banks. On the other hand, the bourgeoisie is gaining from such a
shift, since only when production is centralised and militarised, <I>i.e.</I>, organised by the state, can the bourgeoisie hope to emerge victorious
out of the bloody combat. Present-day war needs more than mere
financial &quot;funding.&quot; A successful war requires that factories and plants,
mines and agriculture, banks and stock exchanges-everything should
&quot;work&quot; for the war. &quot;Everything for the war,&quot; is the slogan of the
bourgeoisie. The exigencies of the war, and of imperialist preparations for
war, force the bourgeoisie to adopt a new form of capitalism, to place
production and distribution under state power, to destroy completely old
bourgeois individualism.</P>

<P>Of course, not all war time measures will remain after the
war. Such measures as bread and meat rations, the ban on the production
of a number of commodities, the ban on exports, etc., will disappear with
the conclusion of peace. There is no doubt, however, that the tendency of
the state to take hold of production will keep on increasing. Co-operation
between the state and private capitalist monopolies after the type of
&quot;mixed enterprises&quot; will probably be introduced in a number of industries;
in military industries, the purely state type of production will probably
remain. Cunow very correctly defines the future of the national economies
as &quot;domination of banking financiers, growth of international
concentration, increase of state control and state enterprises.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#18" name="18b">18)</a></sup></P>

<P>The processes of industrial organisation and of the increase in the
economic activities of the state raises the general question as to the social
meaning of this-to use Professor Jaffé's expression-change in the very
principle of the economic structure. So-called State Socialists, whose
adherents are recruited mainly from the councils of the German university
professors, were the first to feel a rise of spirits. Karl Ballod in full
earnestness speaks of the rebirth of Utopia, assuming as he does that
state monopolies, etc., by themselves introduce a new structure of
production.<sup class="anote"><a href="#19" name="19b">19)</a></sup> Jaffé says that the militarisation of economic life differs from
Socialism mainly in that the term &quot;Socialism&quot; is connected with the
&quot;eudemonistic trend of thought,&quot; whereas in war the individual is entirely
given to the service of the &quot;whole.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#20" name="20b">20)</a></sup> In the writings of Professor
Krahmann we find a very curious argumentation. The future of the mining
industry is thus visualised by the professor:</P>

<P class="quote">The present powerful effect of all the measures in support of the state and
in defence of the country, introduced by the state power because of
military considerations, brings us, in the sphere of mining as well as
elsewhere, considerably nearer to State Socilism. The road, however, is
not that which, prior to the war, was feared
by some, expected by others. This is not internationally diluted but
nationally consolidated Socialism. Such a Socialism we now approach.
This is not democratic Communism, less so aristocratic class domination,
but it is a nationalism that reconciles the classes. Since August 1, 
1914, we have been approaching it with gigantic strides, such as would have been
formerly considered entirely impossible.<sup class="anote"><a href="#21" name="21b">21)</a></sup></P>

<P>What is that picture of present-day &quot;State Socialism&quot; which appears to be
a &quot;change in principle&quot;? From the foregoing analysis the answer seems to
follow with irresistible logic: We have here the process of accelerated
centralisation within the framework of a state capitalist trust, which has
developed to the highest form, not of State Socialism, but of State
Capitalism. By no means do we see here a new structure of production,
i.e., a change in the interrelation of classes; on the contrary, we have here
an increase in the potency of the power of a class that owns the means of
production in quantities hitherto unheard of. To apply to such a state of
affairs a terminology fit for post-capitalist relations, is not only very risky,
but also highly absurd. &quot;War Socialism&quot; and &quot;State Socialism&quot; are
purposely being circulated with the direct intention of misleading the
people and of covering up by a &quot;good&quot; word a very ungainly content.
The capitalist mode of production is based on a monopoly of the means
of production in the hands of the class of capitalists within the general
framework of commodity exchange. There is no difference in principle
whatsoever whether the state power is a direct expression of this
monopoly or whether the monopoly is &quot;privately&quot; organised. In either
case there remains commodity economy (in the first place the world
market) and, what is more important, the class relations between the
proletariat and the bourgeoisie.<sup class="anote"><a href="#22" name="22b">22)</a></sup></P>

<P>It follows from the above that (as far as capitalism will retain its
foothold) the future belongs to economic forms that are close to
state capitalism. This further evolution of the state capitalist trusts,
highly accelerated by the war, is reflected, in its turn, in the worldwide struggle among state capitalist trusts. We have seen above
how the tendency to turn capitalist states into state capitalist trusts
found its reflection in the mutual relations of the states. Monopoly
tendencies within the &quot;national&quot; body have called forth tendencies
to monopolise territories <I>outside </I>the home state by means of
annexations; this has sharpened competition and its forms
terrifically. With the further progress of internal centralisation, this
acute situation will become more acute by leaps and bounds.
Added to this is the rapid narrowing of the free field for capital
activities. There is, therefore, not the slightest doubt that the near
future will be fraught with the most cruel conflicts, and that the
social atmosphere will not cease being saturated with war
electricity. One of the outward expressions of this circumstance is
the extraordinary growth of militarism and of imperialist sentiment.
England, the land of &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;individualism,&quot; has already
established a tariff and is organising a standing army; its state
budget is being militarised. America is preparing war activities on a
truly grandiose scale. The same thing is going on in Germany, in
France, in Japan, and everywhere. The period of an idyllic
&quot;peaceful&quot; existence has sunk into Lethe; capitalist society is
whirling in the mad hurricane of world wars.</P>

<P>It remains for us to say a few words about the future of class
relations, since it is perfectly clear <I>a priori</I> that the new forms of
capitalist relations cannot fail to be reflected in the situation of the
various social groupings. The fundamental economic question is,
What will be the fate of the various parts of the &quot;national&quot; income?
In other words, the question consists in how the &quot;national&quot; product
will be distributed among the various social classes, in the first
place how the &quot;share&quot; of the working class will fare. We presume
that the process is going on more or less alike in all the foremost
countries, and that what is true for &quot;national&quot; economies is true for
world economy.</P>

<P>A deep-going tendency towards decreasing real wages must be
noted first of all. High prices resulting from the disparity of
capitalist production not only will not become lower but, on the
contrary, they will keep on rising (we have in mind prices that are
distinct from specific &quot;war time&quot; dearth). The disparity between
world industry and world agriculture will grow more and more, for
we have entered an era of an accelerated industrialisation of
agrarian countries. Growing militarisation and wars will immensely
tighten the tax press, straining it to the utmost; &quot;everything taxable
will be taxed; everything taxed will bear the greatest possible tax
burden&quot; says a Russian trade paper.<sup class="anote"><a href="#23" name="23b">23)</a></sup> And this is not an empty
phrase. Where non-productive expenditures are colossal and the
state budget is being reconstructed, increased direct and indirect
taxation is inevitable. The mounting cost of living results also from
other causes: first, prices are increased due to the increased tariff
rates; second, there are monopoly prices in trustified industries;
state monopolies in their turn will raise prices for fiscal reasons.
The result will be that an ever greater part of the national product
will be retained by the bourgeoisie and its state.</P>

<P>The opposite tendency, springing from the working class, will, on
the other hand, be confronted with a growing resistance on the part
of the consolidated and organised bourgeoisie that has grown to be
one with the state. Workers' gains that were a usual phenomenon
in the former epoch, become almost impossible. There takes place,
not a relative, but also an <I>absolute </I> worsening of the situation of the
working class. Class antagonisms become inevitably sharpened.
This will take place also for another reason. State capitalist
structure of society, besides worsening the economic conditions of
the working class, makes the workers formally <I>bonded </I> to the
imperialist state. In point of fact, employees of state enterprises
even before the war were deprived of a number of most
elementary rights, like the right to organise, to strike, etc. A railway
or postoffice strike was considered almost an act of treason. The
war has placed those categories of the proletariat under a still
more oppressive bondage. With state capitalism making
nearly every line of production important for the state, with nearly
all branches of production directly serving the interests of war,
prohibitive legislation is extended to the entire field of economic
activities. The workers are deprived of the freedom to move, the
right to strike, the right to belong to the so-called &quot;subversive&quot;
parties, the right to choose an enterprise, etc. They are
transformed into bondsmen attached, not to the land, but to the
plant. They become white slaves of the predatory imperialist state,
which has absorbed into its body all productive life.</P>

<P>Thus the principles of class antagonisms reach a height that could
not have been attained hitherto. Relations between classes become
most clear, most lucid; the mythical conception of a &quot;state elevated
above classes&quot; disappears from the peoples' consciousness, once
the state becomes a direct entrepreneur and an organiser of
production. Property relations, obscured by a number of
intermediary links, now appear in their pristine nakedness. This
being the situation of the working class in the intervals between
wall, it will undoubtedly be still worse in war time The 
<I>Economist</I>, the organ of the English financiers, was perfectly right when it
wrote at the very beginning of the war that the world was entering
an era of the most strenuous social conflicts.</P>
