<P><I>Tout comprendre-c'est tout pardonner</I><sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup> says a French adage. Not
every adage, however, expresses a correct thought. In this
instance we deal with an obviously incorrect idea. To understand a
phenomenon means to establish a causal relation between it and
another phenomenon or series of phenomena. From this it does not
at all follow that a phenomenon correctly understood must be
forgiven under all circumstances. If this were so, then all
phenomena labelled as &quot;evil&quot; in the language of &quot;ethical
personalities&quot; are forever closed to human reason: since evil
cannot be forgiven, obviously it cannot be understood. In reality
matters are not as bad as that. On the contrary, only then can we
appraise a phenomenon, i.e., characterise it as positive or negative,
when we understand it. Consequently, even when we are by no
means inclined to &quot;forgive,&quot; we must first of all &quot;understand.&quot; This
elementary truth is applicable also to historic events. To
understand an historic event means to represent it as the
consequence of a definite historic cause or historic causes; in
other words, to represent it not as an &quot;accidental&quot; entity caused by
nothing, but as an entity inevitably flowing from the total of given
conditions. The element of causality is the element of necessity
(&quot;causal necessity&quot;). Marxism teaches us that the historic process,
and consequently every link in the chain of historic events, is a
&quot;necessary&quot; entity. To deduce political fatalism from this doctrine
is absurd, for the simple reason that historic events are taking
place not outside of but through the will of people, through the
class struggle if we deal with a class society. The will of the
classes is in every instance determined by given circumstances; in
this respect it is not at all &quot;free.&quot; However, that will becomes in
turn a conditioning factor of the historic process. If we eliminate
the actions of people, the struggle of classes, etc., we eliminate the
entire historic process. <I>Fatalist </I>&quot;Marxism&quot; has always been a
bourgeois-made caricature of the Marxist doctrine, contrived by
the theoreticians of the ruling class in order more easily to
overcome Marxism. We have all heard the widely circulated
sophism that Marxists predicting the inevitable coming of the postcapitalist order are like a party struggling for the coming of a lunar
eclipse. On the other hand there has been a strong tendency
among bourgeois opportunists, when they sought for a &quot;strictly
scientific&quot; formulation of their desires, to wrap themselves in the
cloak of that &quot;Marxism,&quot; which, to them, elevates everything
existing at a given moment to the rank of the absolute, and sees in
the existing a limit that cannot be overstepped. Hegel's formula,
&quot;Everything that is is reasonable,&quot; was more than once utilised by
such opportunists for their own purpose. Whereas for Marx the
&quot;reasonableness of everything existing&quot; was only the expression of
a causal relation between the present and the past, a relation the
understanding of which is the starting point for the <I>overcoming </I>
of the &quot;existing,&quot; this &quot;reasonableness&quot; served for the opportunists to
justify and perpetuate it.<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2)</a></sup> <I>Die Geschichte hat immer Recht, </I>
(history is always right), this is how a &quot;Marxist,&quot; Heinrich Cunow, justifies his
&quot;acceptance&quot; of imperialism.<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">3)</a></sup> Every idea of overcoming it, he says, is only an &quot;illusion&quot;; the desire to systematise such ideas is a &quot;worship of illusions&quot; (<I>Illusionenkultus</I>).
Of course, nothing is more shallow than such an interpretation of Marxism. An excellent reply to Cunow is contained in Marx's answer to the bourgeois economist, Burke.</P>

<P>&quot;The laws of commerce&quot; (the latter said) &quot;are the laws of nature
and therefore the laws of God,&quot; to which Marx replied: &quot;In view of
the abominable lack of principle that we see on all hands to-day,
and in view of the devout faith in `the laws of commerce,' it is our
boundless duty again and again to stigmatise the Burkes whose
only difference from their successors was that they had talent!&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">4)</a></sup></P>

<P>But if things existing historically are subject to various estimations,
what is it then that determines &quot;practice&quot;? Where are the limits of
the achievable? To answer these questions more fully let us
suppose two extreme cases. Let us first assume that we are
dealing with a feebly developed proletariat in a country that has
only just started on the road of capitalist development. The social
classes in such a country still represent an unorganised mass. The
proletariat itself has not yet become what Marx terms a &quot;class for
itself.&quot; The economic development is so weak that there are no
objective conditions for the organisation of the economic life on a
social scale. In such a case, we can say outright that there is an
absence of prerequisites necessary for the overcoming of capitalist
contradictions. While recognising in principle the conditional
existence of capitalism, the Marxists at the same time point out that
once it is impossible to divert social development from the capitalist
tracks, what remains to be done is to reckon with the future of
capitalist development and to organise the forces for the active
overcoming of capitalism in the future, utilising at present the
comparative progressiveness of the latter, fighting against the
remnants of feudalism that hamper social progress, etc. There are,
consequently, two decisive moments determining the foundations of
&quot;practical activity&quot;: First an &quot;analysis of objective conditions,&quot; 
<I>i.e., </I>of a given state of economic development; second, an analysis of
the specific social weight of the progressive social force itself,
which of course is connected with the first moment. It is under
conditions just pictured that Marxists speak of the necessity of
capitalism, meaning the relative impossibility of overcoming it.</P>

<P>Let us now assume, secondly, that we deal with a highly developed
capitalist organism, which makes the introduction of a planned
course of social production possible; let us also assume the
interrelation of social forces to be such that a considerable portion
of the population belongs to the most progressive class. Under such
conditions it is perfectly absurd to place the emphasis on capitalism
as the &quot;necessary&quot; stage of development. (The latter to be
understood not in the sense that capitalism as well as its present
stage are products of historic development, but in the sense that it
cannot be overcome.<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">5)</a></sup></P>

<P>If we now approach the question of the necessity of imperialism
(the impossibility of overcoming it), we realise at once that there is
no ground whatever to treat its necessity in this sense. On the
contrary, imperialism is the policy of finance capitalism, i.e., a
highly developed capitalism implying a considerable ripeness of the
organisation of production; in other words, imperialist policies by
their very existence bespeak the ripeness of the objective
conditions for a new socioeconomic form; consequently, all talk
about the &quot;necessity&quot; of imperialism as a limit to action is liberalism,
is in itself semi-imperialism. The further existence of capitalism and
imperialism becomes nothing more nor less than a question of the
interrelation between mutually struggling class forces.</P>

<P>There exists, however, the danger of another opportunist deviation,
which is outwardly opposed to fatalism-a theory now being most
assiduously developed in literature by Karl Kautsky.<sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">6)</a></sup> Starting from
the correct notion that the further existence of imperialism depends upon the interrelation of social forces, Kautsky proceeds along the following line.</P>

<P>Imperialism, he says, is a definite method of capitalist politics; the latter
can exist even without forcible methods, in the same way as capitalism
can exist with an eight-hour work day instead of a ten- or twelve-hour
day. As far as the work day is concerned, the proletariat meets the
bourgeois tendency towards increasing the labour day with its proletarian
tendency to shorten the number of labour hours, doing so within the
framework of capitalism. In the very same manner, says Kautsky, it is
necessary to meet the bourgeois violent tendencies of imperialism with
the peaceful tendencies of the proletariat. Thus, Kautsky asserts, the
question can be solved within the framework of capitalism. Radical as this
theory may seem at the first glance, it is in fact a thoroughly reformist one.
Later we shall deal at length with the analysis of the possibility of
&quot;peaceful capitalism&quot; <I>&aacute; la </I> Kautsky (&quot;ultra-imperialism&quot;). At present we
wish to advance only a formal argument. We assert, namely, that from the
fact that imperialism is a problem of the interrelation of forces, it does not
at all follow that it can disappear within the framework of capitalism, just
as the fifteen-hour work day or unregulated wages, etc... disappeared. If
the problem were to be solved so simply, it would be possible to &quot;map
out&quot; also the following perspective: it is known that capitalism implies the
acquisition of surplus value by the capitalists; all the new value n is
divided into two parts, n=v+s; this distribution, looked upon from its
quantitative side, depends upon the interrelation of social forces (the
antagonism of interests was early formulated by Ricardo). With the
growth of resistance on the part of the working class it is perfectly
thinkable that v will increase at the expense of s, and that n will be
distributed in a proportion more favourable for the workers. Since,
however, the gradual increase of the proletariat's share is determined by
the interrelation of forces, and since there is no limit set for this increase,
the working class, having reduced the share of the capitalist to the size of
mere salaries, peacefully &quot;drains&quot; capitalism in turning the capitalists into
mere employees orat worst-into pensioners of the collective social body.
This idyllic picture is obviously a reformist Utopia. No less of a Utopia is
Kautsky's &quot;ultra-imperialism.&quot;</P>

<P>Kautsky and his followers assert that the very process of capitalist
development is favourable to the growth of elements that can serve as a
support for ultra-imperialism. The growth of international interdependence
of capital, they say, creates a tendency towards eliminating competition
among the various &quot;national&quot; capitalist groups. This &quot;peaceful&quot;
tendency, they say, is strengthened by pressure from below, and in this
way rapacious imperialism is replaced by gentle ultra-imperialism.</P>

<P>Let us analyse the question on its merits. Speaking economically, the
question must be formulated as follows: how is an agreement (or a merger)
of the state capitalist trusts possible? For imperialism, as we all know, is
nothing but the expression of competition between state capitalist trusts.
Once this competition disappears, the ground for the policy of imperialism
disappears also, and capital divided into many &quot;national&quot; groups is
transformed into a single world organisation, a universal world trust
opposed by the world proletariat.</P>

<P>Speaking in an abstract, theoretical way, such a trust is perfectly
thinkable, for, generally speaking, there is no economic limit to the
process of cartelisation. In our opinion, Hilferding is perfectly right when,
in his <I>Finanzkapital, </I>he says:</P>

<P CLASS="quote">The question arises as to where the limits of cartelisation can actually be
drawn. The question must be answered in the sense that there is no
absolute limit to cartelisation. On the contrary, the tendency towards a
continuous widening of the scope of cartelisation may be observed.
Independent industries are becoming more and more dependent upon the
cartelised ones, and finally join them. As a result of this process, a
universal cartel ought to emerge. Here all capital production would be
consciously regulated from one centre, which determines the size of
production in all its spheres....This would be a consciously regulated
society in an antagonistic form. This antagonism, however, is the
antagonism of distribution....The tendency towards creating such a
universal cartel, and the tendency towards establishing a central bank coincide,
and out of their unification grows the great concentrating power of finance
capital.<sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">7)</a></sup></P>

<P>This abstract economic possibility, however, by no means signifies its
actual probability. The same Hilferding is perfectly right when he says in
another place:</P>

<P CLASS="quote">Economically, a universal cartel to guide all production and thus to
eliminate crises, would be possible; such a cartel would be thinkable
economically, although socially and politically such a state appears
unrealisable, for the antagonism of interests, strained to the last possible
limits, would necessarily bring about its collapse.<sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">8)</a></sup></P>

<P>In reality, however, the socio-political causes would not even admit the
formation of such an all-embracing trust. In the following we shall attempt
to prove this thesis.</P>

<P>Comparative equality of positions in the world market is the first condition
for the formation of a more or less stable compact. Where there is no such
equality, the group occupying a more favourable position in the world
market has no reason for joining a compact: on the contrary, it sees an
advantage in continuing the struggle, for it has grown to hope that the
competitor will be defeated. This is a general rule for the formation of
compacts. It is just as applicable to the state capitalist trusts, with which
we are dealing here, as it is in other cases. Two series of conditions,
however, have to be taken into consideration here.</P>

<P>First of all, purely economic equality. This includes equality in the cost of
production. Equality in the cost of production, however, reduces itself in
the final analysis to equality in labour values and therefore to a relatively
equal level of development of productive forces. Thus equality of
economic structure is a condition for the formation of agreements. Where
the difference in economic structure is considerable, where there is, as a
consequence, inequality in the cost of production, there the state
capitalist trust that possesses a higher technique finds it unprofitable to
enter into an agreement. This is why the highly developed industry of
Germany - to take as an example the practice of agreements as we find it in
the various production branches - prefers to appear isolated in the world
market as far as its main lines are concerned. Of course, when we deal with
a state capitalist trust, we take into account a certain mean figure relative to all the production branches; we then proceed, not from the interests of the capitalist groups owning
one or the other production branch, but from the interests of &quot;organised
industry,&quot; where after all the dominant note is being struck by the largescale capitalists of the heavy industry, whose relative economic
importance keeps on growing. Transportation cost is added to production cost proper.</P>

<P>Aside from this &quot;purely economic&quot; equality, a necessary condition for the
formation of stable agreements is equality of economic policies. We have
seen above that capital's connection with the state is transformed into an
additional economic force. The stronger state secures for its industries the
most advantageous trade treaties, and establishes high tariffs that are
disadvantageous for the competitors. It helps its finance capital to
monopolise the sales markets, the markets for raw materials, and
particularly the spheres of capital investment. It is therefore easily
understood why, when conditions of the struggle are being taken stock of
in the world market, the state capitalist trusts reckon not only with the
purely economic conditions of the struggle but also with the economic
policies of the respective states. This is why even where there are
relatively equal economic structures, but the military powers of the state
capitalist trusts differ considerably, it is better for the stronger to continue
the struggle rather than to enter into a compact or to merge with the
others. If we view the situation of the struggling &quot;nations&quot; from this point
of vantage, we realise that there is no reason to expect, at least in the more
or less near future, an agreement or a merging of the state capitalist trusts
and their transformation into a single world trust. It is sufficient to
compare the economic structure of France and Germany, of England and
America, of the developed countries in general, with such countries as
Russia (the latter, though not belonging to the category of state capitalist
trusts, nevertheless add to the establishment of certain relations in the
world market) to realise how far we are from a world capitalist
organisation.<sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">9)</a></sup> The same may be said also as regards military power. If the present war has
shown (at least so far) a comparative equality of the opposing
groups, one must not forget that we deal here with combinations of
forces, each of which is by no means a stable entity.</P>

<P>The question of equality must be considered not only statically, but
mainly dynamically. The &quot;national&quot; groups of the bourgeoisie build
their plans not only on what &quot;is&quot; but also on what &quot;will probably be.&quot;
They take into strict account every possibility of development
which may allow a certain group to become superior to all the
others in due time, although at the present moment it may be
economically and politically equal to its competitor. This
circumstance makes the lack of equilibrium still more actue.<sup class="anote"><a href="#10" name="10b">10)</a></sup> The
great stimulus to the formation of an international state capitalist
trust is given by the internationalisation of capitalist interests as
described in the first section of our work (participation in and
financing of international enterprises, international cartels, trusts,
etc.). Significant as this process may be in itself, it is, however,
counteracted by a still stranger tendency of capital towards
nationalisation, and towards remaining secluded within state
boundaries. The benefits accruing to a &quot;national&quot; group of the
bourgeoisie from a continuation of the struggle are much greater
than the losses sustained in consequence of that struggle. By no
means must we overestimate the significance of the already
existing international industrial agreements. As we have noted
above, many of them are very unstable, representing as they do
businessmen's organisations of a relatively low type with a
comparatively small centralisation, and often embracing highly
specialised production branches (the bottle syndicate). Only
companies formed in such spheres of
production as are based on a natural monopoly (oil) possess
comparative stability. Of course, the tendency towards
internationalisation would none the less triumph &quot;in the last
analysis,&quot; but it would do so after a considerable period of very
stubborn struggles between the state capitalist trusts.</P>

<P>But are not the costs of the struggle, <I>i.e.</I>, military expenditures,
perchance so large that it does not pay for the bourgeoisie to
continue in this way? Is not such a plan as the proposed
militarisation of England an expression of bourgeois &quot;stupidity&quot;
which is blind to its own interests? Alas, it is riot so. We must
attribute this quality rather to the na&iuml;ve pacifists than to the
bourgeoisie. The latter keeps its balance sheet in perfect shape.
The truth of the matter is that those who make such arguments
ordinarily lose sight of all the complex functions of military power.
Such power, as we have seen above, functions not only in times of
war but also in times of peace, to back up its finance capital in
&quot;peaceful competition.&quot; The pacifists forget that the war burdens,
due to the incidence of taxation, etc., are borne mainly by the
working class, partly by the intermediary economic groupings
which are being expropriated during the war (which means in the
process of the greatest centralisation of production).</P>

<P>It follows from the above that the actual process of economic
development will proceed in the midst of a sharpened struggle
between the state capitalist trusts and the backward economic
formations. A series of wars is unavoidable. In the historic process
which we are to witness in the near future, world capitalism will
move in the direction of a universal state capitalist trust by
absorbing the weaker formations. Once the present war is over,
new problems will have to be &quot;solved&quot; by the sword. Partial
agreements are, of course, possible here and there (<I>e.g.</I>, the fusion
of Germany anti Austria is quite probable). Every agreement or
fusion, however, will only reproduce the bloody struggle on a new
scale. Were &quot;Central Europe&quot; to unite according to the plans of the
German imperialists, the situation would remain comparatively the
same; but even were <I>all</I> of Europe to unite, it would not yet signify
&quot;disarmament.&quot; It would signify an unheard of rise of militarism
because the problem to be solved would be
a colossal struggle between Europe on the one hand, America and
Asia on the other. The struggle among small (small!) state capitalist
trusts would be replaced by a struggle between still more colossal
trusts. To attempt to eliminate this struggle by &quot;home remedies&quot; and
rose water is tantamount to bombarding an elephant with peas, for
imperialism is not only a system most intimately connected with
modern capitalism, it is also the most essential element of the latter.</P>

<P>We have seen in the second section the peculiarities in the structure
of modern capitalism and the formation of state capitalist trusts.
This economic structure, however, is connected with a certain
policy, namely, the imperialist policy. This not only in the sense that
imperialism is a product of finance capitalism, but also in the sense
that finance capital cannot pursue any other policy than an
imperialist one, as we characterised it above. The state capitalist
trust cannot become an adherent of free trade for thereby it would
lose a considerable part of its capitalist <I>raison d'&ecirc;tre. </I>
We have already pointed out that protectionism allows the acquisition of additional
profits on the one hand, facilitates competition in the world market
on the other. In the same way finance capital, expressing as it does
capitalist monopoly organisations, cannot relinquish the policy of
monopolising &quot;spheres of influence,&quot; of seizing sales markets and
markets for raw materials, or spheres of capital investment. If one
state capitalist trust fails to get hold of an unoccupied territory, it
will be occupied by another. Peaceful rivalry, which corresponded
to the epoch of free competition and of the absence of any
organisation of production at home, is absolutely inconceivable in
the epoch of an entirely different production structure and of the
struggle among state capitalist trusts. Those imperialist interests are
of such magnitude for the finance capitalise groups, and they are so
connected with the very foundations of their existence, that the
governments do not shrink before the most colossal military
expenditures only to secure for themselves a stable position in the
world market. The idea of &quot;disarmament&quot; within the framework of
capitalism is particularly absurd as far as the state capitalist trusts
that occupy the foremost positions in the world market are
concerned. Before their eyes there always shines the picture of subjugating the whole world, of acquiring an unheard of field for exploitation-a thing termed by the
French imperialists <I>l'organisation d'&eacute;conomie mondiale </I>
and by the German imperialists, <I>Organisierung der Weltwirtschaft</I>
Would the bourgeoisie exchange this &quot;high&quot; ideal for the pot of porridge of
disarmament? Where is the guarantee for a given state capitalist
trust that a pernicious rival will not continue the &quot;abandoned&quot; policy
in spite of all formal agreements and guarantees? Everyone
acquainted with the history of the struggle among cartels even
within the boundaries of one country knows how often, when the
situation changed, when the market conditions changed, agreements
dissolved like soap bubbles. Imagine a strong state capitalist trust
like the U. S. waging war against a union of all other trusts-the
&quot;agreement&quot; will then be shattered to pieces in no time. (In the
latter case we would have a tremendous formation constructed
after the type of an ordinary syndicate, and having the state
capitalist trusts as its component parts. Such an agreement between
the state capitalist trusts would not be able at once to skip all
intermediary stages, to become a real centralised trust. A type of
agreement, however, that implies intense internal struggle is easily
amenable to the influence of changing conditions.) We have taken a
hypothetical case where formal unification is a fact. However, this
unification cannot take place because the bourgeoisie of every
country is by no means as na&iuml;ve as many of its <I>bona fide </I>
pacifists who wish nothing more than to persuade the bourgeoisie and to
&quot;prove&quot; to it that it does not understand its own advantages....</P>

<P>But, one may argue, this is exactly what Kautsky and his friends
assume, namely, that the bourgeoisie will relinquish its imperialistic
methods when it is compelled to do so by pressure from below. Our
reply is that two possibilities are open in this case: either the
pressure is weak, then everything remains as before; or the
pressure is stronger than the &quot;resistance,&quot; then we have before us
not a new era of ultraimperialism but a new era of non-antagonistic
social development.</P>

<P>The entire structure of world economy in our times forces
the bourgeoisie to pursue an imperialist policy. As the colonial
policy is inevitably connected with violent methods, so every
capitalist expansion leads sooner or later to a bloody climax.
&quot;Violent methods,&quot; says Hilferding, &quot;are inseparably bound up with
the very essence of colonial policy, which without them would lose
its capitalist meaning; they are so much an integral element of the
colonial policy as the existence of a proletariat divorced from all
ownership is generally a <I>conditio sine qua non </I> of capitalism. To be
in favour of a colonial policy and at the same time to talk about
eliminating its violent methods, is a dream which cannot be treated
with more earnestness than the illusion that one can eliminate the
proletariat while retaining capitalism.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#11" name="11b">11)</a></sup></P>

<P>The same thing may be said about imperialism. It is an integral
element of finance capitalism without which the latter would lose
its capitalist meaning. To imagine that the trusts, this embodiment
of monopoly, have become the bearers of the free trade policy, of
peaceful expansion, is a deeply harmful Utopian fantasy.</P>

<P>But is not the epoch of &quot;ultra-imperialism&quot; a real possibility after
all, can it not be affected by the centralisation process? Will not
the state capitalist trusts devour one another gradually until there
comes into existence an all-embracing power which has
conquered all the others? This possibility would be thinkable if we
were to look at the social process as a purely mechanical one,
without counting the forces that are hostile to the policy of
imperialism. In reality, however, the wars that will follow each
other on an ever larger scale must inevitably result in a shifting of
the social forces. The centralisation process, looked at from the
capitalist angle, will inevitably clash with a socio-political tendency
that is antagonistic to the former. Therefore it can by no means
reach its logical end; it suffers collapse and achieves completion
only in a new, purified, non-capitalist form. It is for this reason that
Kautsky's theory is by no means realisable. It looks upon
imperialism not as an inevitable accompaniment of capitalist
development, but as upon one of the &quot;dark sides&quot; of capitalist
development. Like Proudhon, whose philistine
Utopia Marx fought so bitterly, Kautsky wishes to eliminate
&quot;dark&quot; imperialism leaving intact the &quot;sunny&quot; sides of the
capitalist order. His concept implies a slurring over of the gigantic
contradictions which rend asunder modern society, and in this
respect it is a reformist concept. It is a characteristic feature of
theorising reformism that it takes pains to point out all the
elements of capitalism's adaptation to conditions without seeing its
contradictions. For a consistent Marxist, the entire development of
capitalism is nothing but a process of a continuous reproduction of
the contradictions of capitalism on an ever wider scale. The future
of world economy, as far as it is a capitalist economy, will not
overcome its inherent lack of adaptation; on the contrary, it will
keep on reproducing this lack of adaptation on an ever wider
scale. These contradictions are actually harmonised in another
production structure of the social organism-through a wellplanned
Socialist organisation of economic activities.</P>
