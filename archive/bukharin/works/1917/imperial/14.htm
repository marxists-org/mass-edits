<P CLASS="pagenoteb">1. THE CAPITALIST AND THE WORKER AS OPPOSITE POLES OF SOCIAL RELATIONS. 2. CLASS ANTAGONISM OF INTERESTS, AND THEIR RELATIVE SOLIDARITY. 3. LASTING INTERESTS AND INTERESTS OF THE MOMENT. 4. THE SO-CALLED PATRIARCHAL RELATIONS BETWEEN LABOUR AND CAPITAL. 5. THE WORKING CLASS AND THE BOURGEOIS STATE. 6. THE WORKING CLASS AND THE IMPERIALIST POLITICS OF THE BOURGEOIS STATE (RELATIVE FORM OF &quot;SOLIDARITY&quot;). 7. THE WORKING CLASS AND THE WAR. 8. COLLAPSE OF &quot;COLLABORATION&quot; WITH THE BOURGEOIS STATE, AND REGENERATION OF REVOLUTIONARY SOCIALISM.</P>

<P>The first period of the war has brought about, not a crisis of
capitalism (the germs of which were visible only to the most
penetrating minds of both the bourgeois and proletarian camps),
but a collapse of the &quot;Socialist&quot; International. This phenomenon,
which many have attempted to explain by proceeding solely from
the analysis of the internal relations in every country, cannot be
more or less satisfactorily explained from this angle. For the
collapse of the proletarian movement is a result of the unequal
situation of the &quot;state capitalist trusts&quot; within the boundaries of
<I>world</I> economy. Just as it is impossible to understand modern
capitalism and its imperialist policy without analysing the
tendencies of world capitalism, so the basic tendencies in the
proletarian movement cannot be understood without analysing
world capitalism.</P>

<P>Capital implies the existence of labour. Labour implies the
existence of capital. The capitalist mode of production is a certain
relation between people, between social classes, each of which
implies the existence of the other. Viewed from this angle, both
capitalists and workers are members, component parts, poles of
the same capitalist society. In so far as capitalist society exists,
there exists also an interdependence of these opposing classes, a
mutual dependence, expressing itself in a relative solidarity of
interests that are opposed in substance. This &quot;solidarity&quot; of interests is the solidarity of a moment, it
is not that lasting solidarity which welds together the members of
the same class. Bourgeois political economy, and together with it
its &quot;Socialist&quot; followers, present that which is passing, momentary,
accidental for the class struggle on a social scale as essential; they
do not see the trees for the forest, and they inevitably sink to the
r&ocirc;le of simple satellites of finance capital.</P>

<P>Here is an example. Everybody knows that at the beginning of the
capitalist era, when the working class had just begun to emerge
and to separate itself from the small entrepreneurs, when so-called
patriarchal relations prevailed between master and worker, the
latter to a considerable degree identified his interests with the
interests of his exploiter.</P>

<P>This identification of interests that are in substance totally opposed
to one another, was, to be sure, not suspended in the air. It had a
very real basis. &quot;The better the business of our shop, the better for
me,&quot; the worker of that time used to reason. This reasoning was
based on the possibility of raising wages with the increase of the
sum total of values realised by a given enterprise.</P>

We find the same psychology in other variations. What, in fact, is,
let us say, the so-called &quot;craft ideology&quot; of the English trade
unionists? We find here substantially the same idea: <I>our</I>
production, they say, <I>our</I> sphere of production, which embraces
both workers and industrialists, must prosper before anything else.
No interference of outside elements must be tolerated.

<P>In recent times we find an analogy to this purely local patriotism in
enterprises with highly skilled labour. Such enterprises, for
instance, are the plants of the well-known American pacifist (and,
incidentally, war contractor) Ford. The workers are carefully
selected for the plant. They receive higher wages, they are
granted various premiums and profit sharing under the condition
that they be bound to the plant. As a result, the bamboozled
workers are &quot;devoted&quot; to their masters.</P>

<P>On a larger scale the same phenomenon may be observed in the
so-called working class protectionism with its policy
of safeguarding &quot;national industry,&quot; &quot;national labour,&quot; etc. This
ideology permeates a considerable part of the Australian and
American workers: &quot;We&quot; (<I>i.e.</I>, both capitalists and workers), they
say, are equally interested in <I>our</I> national industry, for, the higher
the profits of our employers, the higher will our wages rise.</P>

<P>In the process of competitive struggle between the various
enterprises, their situation is not everywhere the same. Enterprises
with highly skilled labour always occupy the first ranks, always
enjoy exceptional privileges. Their share in the surplus value that is
being produced in society as a whole is disproportionately large,
for they receive differential profits on the one hand, cartel rents
(as far as we deal with modern times) on the other. Thus a basis
is created for a momentary interlinking of the interests of capital
and labour in a given production branch, a circumstance which
expresses itself in the workers giving capital, not the labour of
duty, but the labour of love.</P>

<P>It is perfectly obvious that such a &quot;solidarity of interests&quot; between
the capitalist and the worker is of a temporary character, and
(from the point of view of what &quot;ought to be&quot;) it cannot determine
the conduct of the proletariat. Were the workers eternally to hang
on to the coat tails of their masters, they would never be able to
conduct a single strike, and the employers, bribing them
individually, would be able individually to defeat them.</P>

<P>However, because the proletariat has not learned yet to distinguish
local and temporary interests from general and lasting ones, it is
permeated with such a narrow conception. The latter is overcome
only when the class struggle achieves great scope, destroying local
bigotry, welding the workers together, and throwing them into
sharp opposition as a class to the class of the capitalists. In this
way the psychology of the patriarchal period was overcome when
the bond of unity between the workers and the master of an
individual enterprise was severed. In this way the &quot;craft ideology&quot;
of the unions organising skilled workers was overcome.</P>

<P>However, the end of the nineteenth century, which to a large
degree destroyed the bond of unity between capitalists
and workers, which placed against each other those classes and
their organisations as classes and organisations <I>hostile </I>
to each other in principle, has not yet destroyed the bond of unity between
the working class and the greatest organisation of the bourgeoisie,
the capitalist state.</P>

<P>The working class connection with this organisation was expressed
in the ideology of workers' patriotism (&quot;social-patriotism&quot;), in the
idea of a &quot;fatherland,&quot; which the working class is supposed to
serve.</P>

<P>After what has been presented above, the material basis of this
phenomenon will become clear if we turn our attention to the
whole sphere of world economy.</P>

<P>We have seen that the competitive struggle was, by the end of the
nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, to a large
extent transferred to the foreign markets, <I>i.e.</I>, it became a
competition in the world market. Thus the state organisation of
capital, the &quot;fatherland,&quot; having turned into a state capitalist trust,
took the place of the individual enterprise and appeared on the
world arena with all its heavy and ponderous apparatus.</P>

<P>From this angle we must first of all view the <I>colonial</I> policy of the
imperialist states.</P>

<P>There is an opinion current among many moderate internationalists
to the effect that the colonial policy brings nothing but harm to the
working class and that <I>therefore</I> it must be rejected. Hence the
natural desire to prove that colonies yield no profit at all, that they
represent a liability even from the point of view of the bourgeoisie,
etc. Such a point of view is being propounded, for instance, by
Kautsky.</P>

<P>The theory unfortunately suffers from one shortcoming, namely, it
is out and out incorrect. The colonial policy yields a colossal
income to the great powers, <I>i.e.</I>, to their ruling classes, to the &quot;state
capitalist trust.&quot; This is why the bourgeoisie pursues a colonial
policy. This being the case, there is a possibility for raising the
workers' wages at the expense of the exploited colonial savages
and conquered peoples.</P>

<P>Such are exactly the results of the great powers' colonial policy.
The bill for this policy is paid, not by the continental
workers, and not by the workers of England, but by the little
peoples of the colonies. It is in the colonies that all the blood and
the filth, all the horror and the shame of capitalism, all the
cynicism, greed and bestiality of modern democracy are
concentrated. The European workers, considered from the point of
view of the moment, are the winners, because they receive
increments to their wages due to &quot;industrial prosperity.&quot;</P>

<P>All the relative &quot;prosperity&quot; of the European-American industry
was conditioned by nothing but the fact that a safety valve was
opened in the form of colonial policy. In this way the exploitation
of &quot;third persons&quot; (pre-capitalist producers) and colonial labour led
to a rise in the wages of the European and American workers.</P>

<P>One highly important circumstance must here be noted: in their
struggle for colonies, for sales markets, and markets for raw
materials, for capital investment spheres, for cheap labour, not all
the &quot;state capitalist trusts&quot; achieve an equal success. While
England, Germany and the United States of America forged ahead
in their triumphal march over the world market, Russia and Italy,
all the strenuous efforts of the imperialists notwithstanding, proved
too weak. It was in this way that a few great imperialist powers
came to the forefront as pretenders to world monopoly. They have
proved, as far as the others are concerned, &quot;above competition.&quot;</P>

<P>Economically the situation is this. World surplus value is being
divided in the struggle for the world market. As is the case within
the framework of &quot;national economy,&quot; so also within the
boundaries of world economy, the stronger competitor (whose
strength is increased by multifarious factors, like the structure of
production, the strength of the state militarist apparatus, convenient
location due to the presence of &quot;natural monopolies,&quot; etc.) receives
super-profits, a kind of differential profit (due to the superior
structure of production) and a kind of cartel rent (due to the
pressure of the militarist apparatus that fortifies monopolies).</P>

<P>Super-profits obtained by the imperialist state are accompanied by
a rise in the wages of the respective strata of the working class,
primarily the skilled workers.</P>

<P>Such a phenomenon could also be observed in olden times.
It was pointed out by Friedrich Engels who referred to the
monopoly situation of England in the world market and to the
conservatism of the English proletariat that resulted therefrom.</P>

<P>It was on the basis of this relative interest of the proletariat in
colonial plunders that its connection with the masters' organisation
of the bourgeois imperialist state grew and became strong. In
Socialist literature this psychology found expression in the
&quot;national&quot; point of view of the Social-Democratic opportunists. This
&quot;national wisdom,&quot; emphasised on every occasion, signified a
complete abandonment of the point of view of revolutionary
Marxism.</P>

<P>Marx and Engels viewed the state as an organisation of the ruling
class that crushes the oppressed class with blood and iron. They
assumed that future society would have no state at all, for the
simple reason that there would be no classes. It is true that, for the
transition period of proletarian dictatorship, when the proletariat is
the temporary ruling class, they most correctly demanded a strong
apparatus of working class state power to keep the overthrown
classes in leash. Still, their attitude towards the oppressing state
apparatus of the bourgeoisie was that of furious hatred, and from
this point of view they mercilessly criticised the Lassalleans and
other &quot;statesmen.&quot; And a connection undoubtedly exists between
this revolutionary point of view and the well-known thesis of the
<I>Communist Manifesto </I>that the workers have no fatherland.</P>

<P>The Socialist epigones of Marxism have relegated this
revolutionary opposition of Marx and Engels to the archives. In its
place there emerge the theories of &quot;<I>true </I>patriotism&quot; and 
&quot;<I>true</I> statesmanship,&quot; which, however, are in no way distinguishable
from the most ordinary patriotism and the most ordinary
statesmanship of the ruling bourgeoisie. Such an ideology was an
organic outgrowth of the proletariat's partaking in the &quot;great-nation
policy&quot; of the state capitalist trusts.</P>

<P>No wonder if after the outbreak of the great war, the working
class of the foremost capitalist countries, chained to the chariot of
the bourgeois state power, came to the aid of the latter. The
proletariat was prepared for this by the whole
preceding development; it was brought to this by its 
connection with the state organisation of finance capital.</P>

<P>However, the war itself, which could be waged only because the
proletariat gave its tacit consent or showed insufficient indignation,
has proven to it that its share in the imperialist policy is nothing
compared with the wounds inflicted by the war.</P>

<P>It is in this way that there comes the crisis of imperialism and the
rebirth of proletarian Socialism. Imperialism has turned its true
face to the working class of Europe. Hitherto its barbarous,
destructive, wasteful activities were almost entirely confined to the
savages; now it thrusts itself upon the toilers of Europe with all the
horrifying impact of a bloodthirsty elemental power let loose. The
additional pennies received by the European workers from the
colonial policy of imperialism-what do they count compared to
millions of butchered workers, to billions devoured by the war, to
the monstrous pressure of brazen militarism, to the vandalism of
plundered productive forces, to high cost of living and starvation!</P>

<P>The war severs the last chain that binds the workers to the
masters, their slavish submission to the imperialist state. The last
limitation of the proletariat's philosophy is being overcome: its
clinging to the narrowness of the national state, its patriotism. The
interests of the moment, the temporary advantage accruing to it
from the imperialist robberies and from its connections with the
imperialist state, become of secondary importance compared with
the lasting and general interests of the class as a whole, with the
idea of a social revolution of the international proletariat which
overthrows the dictatorship of finance capital with an armed hand,
destroys its state apparatus and builds up a new power, a power of
the workers against the bourgeoisie. In place of the idea of
defending or extending the boundaries of the bourgeois state that
bind the productive forces of world economy hand and foot, this
power advances the slogan of <I>abolishing </I>state boundaries and
merging all the peoples into one Socialist family. In this way the
proletariat, after painful searching, succeeds in grasping its true
interests that lead it through revolution to Socialism.</P>
