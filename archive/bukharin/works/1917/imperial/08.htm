<H3>Chapter 8: World Economy and the &quot;National&quot; State</H3>




<P CLASS="pagenoteb">1. REPRODUCTION OF WORLD CAPITAL AND THE ROOTS OF CAPITALIST EXPANSION. 2. OVERPRODUCTION OF INDUSTRIAL GOODS, UNDERPRODUCTION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, AND OVERPRODUCTION OF CAPITAL AS THREE FACETS OF THE SAME PHENOMENON. 3. CONFLICT BETWEEN WORLD ECONOMY AND THE LIMITATIONS OF THE &quot;NATIONAL&quot; STATE. 4. IMPERIALISM AS THE POLICY OF FINANCE CAPITAL. 5. IDEOLOGY OF IMPERIALISM.</P>

<P>From the point of view of the ruling circles of society, frictions and conflicts
between &quot;national&quot; groups of the bourgeoisie, inevitably arising inside of
present-day society, lead in their further development to war as the only
solution of the problem. We have seen that those frictions and conflicts are
caused by the changes that have taken place in the conditions of reproducing
world capital. Capitalist society, built on a number of antagonistic elements,
can maintain a relative equilibrium only at the price of painful crises; the
adaptation of the various parts of the social organism to each other and to the
whole can be achieved only with a colossal waste of energy, under
tremendous &quot;<I>faux frais</I>&quot; of this adaptation, which flow from the character of
capitalist society as such, i.e., from a definite historical formulation of the
development in general.</P>

<P>We have laid bare three fundamental motives for the conquest policies of
modern capitalist states: increased competition in the sales markets, in the
markets of raw materials, and for the spheres of capital investment. This is
what the modern development of capitalism and its transformation into
finance capitalism has brought about.</P>

<P>Those three roots of the policy of finance capitalism, however, represent in
substance only three facets of the same phenomenon, namely of the conflict
between the growth of productive forces on the one hand, and the &quot;national&quot;
limits of the production organisation on the other.</P>

<P>Indeed, overproduction of manufactured goods is at the same time
underproduction of agricultural products. Underproduction of agricultural
products is in this case important for us in so far as the demand on the part of
industry is excessively large, <I>i.e., </I>in so far as there are large volumes of
manufactured goods which cannot be exchanged for agricultural products; in
so far as the ratio between those two branches of production has been (and is
more and more) disturbed. This is why growing industry seeks for an agrarian
&quot;economic supplement&quot; which, within the framework of capitalism,
particularly its monopoly form, <I>i.e., </I>finance capital, inevitably expresses itself
in the form of subjugating agrarian countries by force of arms.</P>

<P>We have just discussed the exchange of commodities. Capital export,
however, does not represent an isolated phenomenon, either. Capital export,
as we have seen, is due to a certain overproduction of capital.
Overproduction of capital, however, is nothing but another formulation for
overproduction of commodities:</P>

<P class="quote">Overproduction of capital [says Marx] never signifies anything else but overproduction of means of production-means of production and necessities of life-which may serve as capital, that is, serve for the exploitation of labour at a given degree of exploitation. ...Capital consists of commodities, and therefore the overproduction of
capital implies an overproduction of commodities.<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup></P>

<P>Conversely, when the overproduction of capital decreases, there is also a decrease in the overproduction of commodities. This is why capital export, in decreasing overproduction of capital, . aids also in decreasing the overproduction of commodities. (Let us note parenthetically that if, for instance, iron beams are exported into another country to be sold there, we have commodity export pure and simple; if, however, the beam-producing firm establishes an enterprise in another country and exports its commodities to equip the enterprise, we have capital export; obviously, the criterion is whether the transactions of purchase and sale take place or not.)</P>

<P>But even aside from simply &quot;relieving the congestion&quot; by exporting capital in commodity form, there is also a further connection between capital export and the decrease in the overproduction of commodities. Otto Bauer has very well formulated this connection.</P>

<P CLASS="quote">Thus [he says] the exploitation of economically backward countries by the capitalists of a European country has two series of consequences: directly, it creates new spheres of investment for capital in the colonial country, and at the same time more selling opportunities for the industry of the dominating power; indirectly, it creates new spheres for the application of capital also inside of the dominating country, and increases the sale of the products of all its industries.<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2)</a></sup></P>


<P>If we thus consider the problem in its entirety, and take thereby the objective point of view, <I>i.e., </I>the point of view of the adaptation of modern society to its conditions of existence, we find that there is here a growing discord between the basis of social economy which has become world-wide and the peculiar class structure of society, a structure where the ruling class (the bourgeoisie) itself is split into &quot;national&quot; groups with contradictory economic interests, groups which, being opposed to the world proletariat, are competing among themselves for the division of the surplus value created on a world scale. Production is of a social nature; international division of labour turns the private &quot;national&quot; economies into parts of a gigantic all-embracing labour process, which extends over almost the whole of humanity. Acquisition, however, assumes the character of &quot;national&quot; (state) acquisition where the beneficiaries are huge state companies of the bourgeoisie of finance capital. The development of productive forces moves within the narrow limits of state boundaries while it has already outgrown those limits. Under such conditions there inevitably arises a conflict, which, given the existence of capitalism, is settled through extending the state frontiers in bloody struggles, a settlement which holds the prospect of new and more grandiose conflicts.</P>

<P>The social representatives of this contradiction are the various groups of the bourgeoisie organised in the state, with their conflicting interests. The development of world capitalism leads, on the one hand, to an internationalisation of the economic life and, on the other, to the leveling of economic differences,-and to an infinitely greater degree, the same process of economic development intensifies the tendency to &quot;nationalise&quot; capitalist interests, to form narrow &quot;national&quot; groups armed to the teeth and ready to hurl themselves at one another any moment. It is impossible to describe the fundamental aims of presentday politics better than was done by R. Hilferding. &quot;The policy of finance capital,&quot; he says, &quot;pursues a threefold aim: first, the creation of the largest possible economic territory which, secondly, must be protected against foreign competition by tariff walls, and thus, thirdly, must become an area of exploitation for the national monopoly companies.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">3)</a></sup> The increase in the economic territory opens agrarian regions to the national cartels and, consequently, markets for raw materials, increasing the sales markets and the sphere of capital investment; the tariff policy makes it possible to suppress foreign competition, to obtain surplus profit, and to put into operation the battering ram of dumping; the &quot;system&quot; as a whole facilitates the increase of the rate of profit for the monopoly organisations. This policy of finance capital is imperialism.</P>

<P>Such a policy implies violent methods, for the expansion of the state territory means war. The reverse, however, is not true; not every war or every increase in the state territory implies an imperialist policy. The determining factor is whether the war expresses the policy of finance capital, the latter term being taken in accordance with the above definition. Here, as everywhere, we find some intermediary forms, whose existence, however, by no means vitiates the main definition. This is why attempts like those made by the well-known Italian economist and sociologist, Achille Loria, are fundamentally incorrect. Loria, namely, has attempted to construct two conceptions of imperialism which, he alleges, contain &quot;entirely heterogeneous relations&quot; (<I>des r&eacute;lations tout &agrave; fait h&eacute;t&eacute;rog&egrave;nes</I>). Loria distinguishes<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">4)</a></sup> between &quot;economic&quot; imperialism (<I>l'imp&eacute;rialisme &eacute;conomique, &ouml;konomischer Imperialismus</I>) and &quot;commercial&quot; or &quot;trade&quot; imperialism (<I>l'imp&eacute;rialisme commercial, Handelsimperialismus</I>). The object of the former, he says, are tropical countries, the object of the latter are countries whose conditions make them suitable also for European colonisation; the method of the former is armed force, the method of the latter, peaceful treaties (<I>des accords pacifiques</I>); the former has no shadings or grades, in the latter they range from the maximum of full assimilation or a single tariff to incomplete forms, like preference tariffs between the colonies and the mother countries, etc.</P>

<P>This is Loria's theory. It is quite obvious that it is made out of whole cloth.
Both the &quot;commercial&quot; and the &quot;economic&quot; imperialisms are in substance
the expression of the same tendencies, as we have seen above. A closed
ring of tariff duties, and the raising of the latter, may not result in an armed
conflict immediately; they will, however, bring about such a conflict later.
It is thus obvious that we cannot contrast &quot;peaceful treaties&quot; with &quot;armed
forces.&quot; (Peaceful treaties between England and its colonies mean a
straining of the relations between England and other countries.) Neither
can we assert that &quot;economic&quot; imperialism is merely of a &quot;tropical&quot; nature.
The best proof is the fate of Belgium, Galicia, and the probable fate of
South America, China, Turkey, and Persia.</P>


<P>To sum up: the development of the productive forces of world capitalism
has made gigantic strides in the last decades. The upper hand in the
competitive struggle has everywhere been gained by large-scale
production; it has consolidated the &quot;magnates of capital&quot; into an ironclad
organisation, which has taken possession of the entire economic life. State
power has become the domain of a financial oligarchy; the latter manages
production which is tied up by the banks into one knot. This process of
the organisation of production has proceeded from below; it has fortified
itself within the framework of modern states, which have become an exact
expression of the interests of finance capital. Every one of the
capitalistically advanced &quot;national economies&quot; has turned into some kind
of a &quot;national&quot; trust. This process of the organisation of the economically
advanced sections of world economy, on the other hand, has been
accompanied by an extraordinary sharpening of their mutual competition.
The overproduction of commodities, which is connected with the growth of large enterprises; the
export policy of the cartels, and the narrowing of the sales markets in
connection with the colonial and tariff policy of the capitalist powers; the
growing disproportion between tremendously developed industry and
backward agriculture; the gigantic growth of capital export and the
economic subjugation of entire regions by &quot;national&quot; banking combinesall
this has thrown into the sharpest possible relief the clash of interests
between the &quot;national&quot; groups of capital. Those groups find their final
argument in the force and power of the state organisation, first of all in its
army and navy. A mighty state military power is the last trump in the
struggle of the powers. The fighting force in the world market thus
depends upon the power and consolidation of the &quot;nation,&quot; upon its
financial and military resources. A self-sufficient national state, and an
economic unit limitlessly expending its great power until it becomes a world
kingdom - a world-wide empire - such is the ideal built up by finance capital.</P>

<P CLASS="quote">With a steady and clear eye does it [finance capital] view the Babylonian
confusion of peoples, and above all of them it sees its own nation. The
latter is real; it lives in a powerful state, which keeps on increasing its power
and grandeur, and which devotes all its forces to making them greater. In
this way, the interests of the individual are subjugated to the interests of
the whole-a condition without which no social ideology can live; a nation
and a state that are hostile to the people are tied into one whole, and the
national idea, as a motive power, is subjugated to politics. The class
conflicts have disappeared; they have been annihilated, absorbed as they
are in serving the interests of the whole. In place of the dangerous class
struggle, fraught for the owners with unknown consequences, there appear
the general actions of the nation which is united by one aim-the striving for
national grandeur.<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">5)</a></sup></P>

<P>Thus the interests of finance capital acquire a grandiose ideological
formulation; every effort is made to inculcate it into the mass of workers,
for, as a German imperialist has correctly remarked from his point of view:
&quot;We must gain power not only over the legs of the soldiers, but also over
their minds and hearts.&quot;<sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">6)</a></sup></P>
