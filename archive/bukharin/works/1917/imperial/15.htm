<H3>Chapter 15: Conclusion</H3>

<P>History moves in contradictions. The skeleton of historic existence, the
economic structure of society, also develops in contradictions. Forms
eternally follow forms. Everything has only a passing being. The dynamic
force of life creates the new over and over again-such is the law inherent
in reality. Hegel's dialectics, which Marx placed on its feet, is valuable for
this very reason that it grasps the dialectics of life, that it fearlessly
analyses the present without being disturbed by the fact that every
existence hides within itself the germ of its own destruction.</P>

<P class="quote">In its mystified form, dialectic became the fashion in Germany because it
seemed to transfigure and to glorify the existing state of things. In its
rational form it is a scandal and abomination to bourgeoisdom and its
doctrinaire professors, because it includes in its comprehension an
affirmative recognition of the existing state of things, at the same time
also, the recognition of the negation of that state, of its inevitable
breaking up; because it regards every historically developed social form
as in fluid movement, and therefore takes into account its transient nature
not less than its momentary existence; because it lets nothing impose
upon it, and is in its essence critical and revolutionary in spirit.</P>

<P>Thus Marx in his foreword to the first volume of <I>Capital</I>. Many years have
passed since; we already hear a new future knocking at history's door.
Present-day society, which developing productive forces to a gigantic
degree, while powerfully conquering ever new realms, while subjugating
nature to man's domination on an unprecedented scale, begins to choke in
the capitalist grip. Contradictions inherent in the very essence of
capitalism, and appearing in an embryonic state at the beginning of its
development, have grown, have widened their scope with every stage of
capitalism; in the period of imperialism 
they have reached proportions that cry to heaven. Productive forces in
their present volume insistently demand new production relations. The
capitalist shell must inevitably burst.</P>

<P>The epoch of finance capital has made all the elements of maladjustment
of the capitalist organisation stand out in the boldest possible relief. In
former times, when capitalism, as well as its class sponsor, the
bourgeoisie, appeared as a progressive force, it was in a position partly to
conceal its inner defects by comparing itself with the backwardness and
maladaptation of pre-capitalist relations. Large-scale production, equipped
with gigantic machines, ruthlessly crushed the handicrafts with their poor
technique. This painful process was nothing but the collapse of precapitalist production forms. On the other hand, the very existence of those
forms, of those various "third persons" in the capitalist production
process, allowed capitalism to extend its power "peacefully," without
exposing the limits put to economic evolution by its capitalist shell. This
is why the general features of the contradictions inherent in capitalism as
such, and forming its "<I>law</I>," appeared in the sharpest possible form only
at a stage of economic development when capitalism had outgrown its
swaddling clothes, when it had not only become the prevailing form of the
socioeconomic life, but had even become the general form of economic
relations, in other words, when it had appeared as world capitalism. It is
only now that the inner contradictoriness of capitalism is expressed with
dramatic force. The convulsions of the present-day capitalist world that is
drenched in blood and is agonised in mortal pain, are the expression of
those contradictions in the capitalist system, which in the long run will
cause it to explode.</P>

<P>Capitalism has attempted to overcome its own anarchy by pressing it into
the iron ring of state organisation. But having eliminated competition
within the state, it let loose all the devils of a world scuffle.</P>

<P>Capitalism has attempted to tame the working class and to subdue social
contradictions by decreasing the steam pressure through the aid of a
colonial valve. But having accomplished this task for a moment, it thus
prepared the explosion of the whole capitalist boiler.</P>

<P>Capitalism has attempted to adapt the development of pro ductive forces to state limits
of exploitation by resorting to imperialist conquests. But it proved unable to solve tha
problem even through its own methods.</P>

<P>Capitalism has increased the power of militarism enor mously. It has brought to the
historic arena millions o armed men. The arms, however, begin to turn against capi
talism itself. The masses of the people, aroused to politica: life and originally tame and
docile, raise their voices eves higher. Steeled in battles forced upon them from above,
ac customed to look into the face of death every minute, they begin to break the front
of the imperialist war with the same fearlessness by turning it into civil war against the
bourgeoisie Thus capitalism, driving the concentration of production to extraordinary
heights, and having created a centralised pro duction apparatus, has therewith prepared
the immense rank: of its own grave-diggers. In the great clash of classes, the
dictatorship of finance capital is being replaced by the dicta torship of the revolutionary
proletariat. "The hour of capitalist property has struck. The expropriators are being
expropriated."</P>
