<p class="fst">At the full meeting of our Executive Committee, held at the week-end, they had before them the report of the Second Congress of the Third International, included in which was the expressed desire on the part of that body for <em>one</em> united Communist Party in this country. Further endeavours were exhorted towards this end, which call for a statement from the Communist Party.
</p>
<p>
We wish it to be perfectly understood that we are in no way averse to any further attempt at securing a greater degree of Communist unity in this country and are still as we have been, prepared to discuss the matter with any or all of those bodies still outside the Communist Party. The Congress of the Third International has somewhat cleared the ground for us, submitting its own decisions on both policy and tactics as the basis around which this complete and united Communist Party was to be formed. With these decisions we	are in perfect agreement and would welcome any further negotiations, which have for their object a united Communist Party on the basis of these decisions.
</p>
<p class="fst">On behalf of the Communist Party<br />
ARTHUR MACMANUS, Chairman<br />
ALBERT INKPIN, Secretary.</p>
