<p class="fst">Dear Max Shachtman:</p>

<p class="fst">The July number of <strong>The New International</strong> having come to my attention by accident, I read there with emotion <a href="../../../shachtma/1942/07/2soldiers.html" target="new">your article</a> on Riazanov and Sneevliet. I knew Riazanov, followed closely the drama of his end, and Sneevliet was my friend. I can contribute some additional information about them which may also be of interest to your readers.</p>

<p>Riazanov was arrested in 1931, following a very lively altercation with the secretary-general ... He was accused of having hidden in the strongbox of the Marx-Engels Institute some documents relating to alleged negotiations of the Mensheviks with the Socialist International concerning ... a Franco-Polish intervention in the USSR! In reality, he had protested in various ways against the preparation of a monstrous frame-up trial and more particularly against the use that was to be made at the trial of the &#8220;confessions&#8221; of one of his collaborators, Sher, who was neurasthenic to the point of being obviously half-irresponsible.</p>

<p>On May 11 or 12, 1940, being in Paris, I received a letter from Sneevliet, who had just taken refuge in Antwerp. By the time the letter arrived in my hands, Antwerp was already threatened. Sneevliet asked me to get him a French visa. I found no support from anybody. I received nothing, my only friends in a position to intercede with the authorities, socialists, no longer having any real influence. So Sneevliet did not succeed in finding asylum in France. I received a similar request from a courageous Italian anti-fascist, a friend of Bordiga, Perrone, who, fleeing from Brussels, was blocked with his family at the frontier. Up to the very moment when the Nazis crossed the Franco-Belgian frontier, the French gendarmerie refused to let &#8220;the foreigners&#8221; pass (it let the Belgians pass), thus turning over to the enemy a certain number of Italians, Spaniards, Russians and others. At the last moment, the Belgian authorities began to intern all the foreigners, starting with the anti-fascist refugees. Perrone, like Sneevliet, disappeared in the tumult of the invasion. For a while I hoped that Sneevliet had succeeded in getting to England; everything leads me to believe that he tried it without success. For him to remain in occupied territory was to commit a sort of suicide and he was well aware of it. He tried to escape, he failed, he fulfilled his duty as a militant on the spot and to the very end.</p>
