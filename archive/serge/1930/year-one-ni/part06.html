signed an armistice with imperial Germany and the peace
negotiations opened on December 9 in the fortress of Brest-Litovsk

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">By January 10, the negotiations had reached a deadlock. The
Germans were furious with the Bolsheviks&rsquo; agitation, and the
Bolsheviks were faced with the alternative of continuing a hopeless
war or subscribing to a disastrous, outrageous and demoralizing
peace.</p>

<p>There was no principle involved for the Bolsheviks, who were
strangers to any pacifist illusions. Ever since 1916 Lenin had
foreseen, in case of a socialist victory in one or more countries, an
offensive war against the remaining capitalist countries.</p>

<p>In April 1917 he wrote: if the Soviets were in power:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;... we would support a revolutionary war against
the capitalists of no matter what country, for that would really be a
war against the interests of all capital, and not a war in the
interests of the capitalists of any one country.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">But now it was not a question of principle that confronted the
Bolsheviks. The army was breaking up of its own accord as the
soldiers returned home. The masses did not want to fight any more.
The October insurrection was carried out in the name of peace. The
transportation system was crippled, production was completely
disorganized, the food supply in a sad state. Famine threatened more
than ever.</p>

<p>A report from the Tenth Army said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The infantry and artillery left their positions on
January 15 and retired to the rear. A part of the artillery was
abandoned. There is no longer any fortified zone.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Someone from the Second Army wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The trenches are filled with snow. The
fortifications are being used for fuel. The roads are lost under the
snow; there is nothing left but a path leading to the shelters, the
kitchens, and the German shops; a sector of more than six miles is
now occupied by the staff and the Regiment Committee alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">&ldquo;More than two thousand cannon were abandoned at the front,&rdquo;
said M.N. Pokrovsky. For the Russians the war was over.</p>

<p>But the German conditions for peace were none the less
unacceptable. Besides, it was hard to tell the exact state of
affairs. Information as to the actual extent of the spontaneous
demobilization was lacking, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of some
of the Communists carried them away.</p>

<p>On January 21, on the eve of the Third All-Russian Congress of the
Soviets, an important meeting of Bolshevik Party leaders was held in
Petrograd. Three differing points of view were presented. Lenin was
for signing the peace; Trotsky considered a revolutionary war
impossible, but wanted the Bolsheviks to break off the negotiations
so that it might become evident that German violence was responsible
for the peace; a third group was for revolutionary war on the
Germans.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Lenin in the Minority</h4>

<p class="fst">There were sixty-five Bolsheviks present. Lenin was in the
minority on the vote after he had explained his thesis. The
proponents of a revolutionary war received thirty-two votes.
Trotsky&rsquo;s intermediary tendency sixteen, and Lenin fifteen.</p>

<p>The Central Committee of the party met the next day. Lenin
explained the impossibility of fighting, the lack of horses, the
necessity for sacrificing the artillery in case of a retreat, the
ease with which the Germans would be able to capture Reval and
Petrograd.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The peace they have proposed is infamous,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;But if we refuse to sign we shall be swept away, and
another government will make the peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Germany is moving toward revolution, he concluded, but the
socialist republic already exists in Russia and needs a breathing
spell. Trotsky urged a costly international demonstration: we are
already losing socialist Poland; we are also losing Esthonia. But</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;the salvation of the socialist republic is worth
three billion [the indemnity demanded by Germany] ... If we believe
the German revolution will burst out the moment the negotiations are
broken off, we must sacrifice ourselves, for the German revolution is
more important than ours. But the German revolution has not yet
begun. We must hold on until the general socialist revolution, and we
can do that only by making peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Zinoviev, Stalin and Sokolnikov supported Lenin; Lomov and
Krestinsky voted for war; the formula of Trotsky, Bukharin and
Uritsky &ndash; to draw out the negotiations &ndash; won a majority.
The same solution in a more precise form &ndash; &ldquo;Neither war
nor peace&rdquo; &ndash; was adopted several days later on January 14
by the Central Committee of the Bolshevik and S-R Parties in a common
meeting.</p>

<p>The majority recognized the impossibility of carrying on a
revolutionary war but thought that a German offensive, if at all
possible, would provoke a revolutionary explosion on both sides of
the front. The Third All-Russian Congress of the Soviets delegated
all powers to the Council of People&rsquo;s Commissars.</p>

<p>Lenin was in the minority, and not only in the Central Committee.
The influential committees of the Moscow District, of Petrograd, of
the Urals, the Ukraine, etc., voted against his position.</p>

<p>So strong were the democratic traditions of this highly
disciplined party that its leader inclined before the majority, but
without giving up the struggle for his point of view. Once more, this
time in his own party, Lenin swam against the stream.</p>

<p>As was his custom at critical moments, Lenin clarified his views
in the condensed, explicit and concise form of a thesis. His theses
were never long and not too frequent. His thesis on peace in
twenty-one articles of five to fifteen lines each is a model.</p>

<p><em>[He argued that the revolution could gain the time needed to
consolidate itself only by temporarily yielding to Germany&rsquo;s
robber demands, that there was no possibility of successfully waging
a revolutionary war, that it would be suicidal to make grand gestures
that could not be backed up.]</em> Lenin&rsquo;s thesis was correctly
called the thesis of the breathing spell.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&ldquo;Too Risky&rdquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">A strong left tendency was already crystallizing in the party
around the extreme leftists of the Moscow District: Yaroslavsky,
Soltz, Muralov, Sapronov, Ossinsky, Stukov, etc. Since the end of
December, the Moscow District Committee had demanded the rupture of
the Brest-Litovsk negotiations; in fact had demanded the rupture of
all diplomatic relations with &ldquo;all capitalist countries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The District Committee even considered economic treaties between
socialist and capitalist states impermissible. In their opinion it
was better to &ldquo;die for the cause of socialism than bow before
Kaiser Wilhelm.&rdquo; Only a people&rsquo;s uprising could bring
about a democratic peace, they said. The basis of this thesis was
sheer abstract revolutionary romanticism.</p>

<p>Trotsky&rsquo;s thesis was much different. Trotsky had no
illusions as to the possibility of continuing the war. But he thought
that Germany, in the throes of a profound crisis, whose exhausted
armies were already influenced by the Russian Revolution, would be
unable to take the offensive. He thought it necessary to try out the
German army and the German working class. To which Lenin replied:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;It is possible, but risky, too risky.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The Allied press treated the Bolsheviks as paid agents of the
kaiser, and the difficult negotiations at Brest-Litovsk as a
prearranged comedy played for the sake of appearances.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Here are the Bolsheviks dissolving the
&lsquo;democratic&rsquo; Constituent Assembly in order to conclude a
humiliating slave treaty with the kaiser, while Northern France and
Belgium are still occupied by German armies. It is obvious that the
Allied governments would find it easy in such a situation to fool the
masses and perhaps even find support for armed intervention against
us,&rdquo; said Trotsky.</p>

<p class="fst">For several years the masses had been exposed to the poison of
chauvinism; as yet the internationalists formed only small and
scattered groups in the workers&rsquo; movement. If the Bolsheviks
did nothing to reassure the doubts caused by a separate peace between
Russia and Germany, would not the masses of, the Allied countries
permit armed intervention against the Soviets? On the contrary, if
the Bolsheviks signed the disastrous treaty only at the point of
German guns, all these doubts would be removed.</p>

<p>To which Lenin obstinately replied:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Too risky. At present nothing is more precious
than our revolution. We must protect it at all costs.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky appealed to the situation inside the party. An immediate
peace might lead to a split; the departure of valuable leftists would
automatically reinforce the right wing. Lenin replied:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;These whims will pass. A split is not absolutely
inevitable. And if it does occur, the splitters will soon return to
the party. But if the Germans wipe us out, we shall not return at all
...&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;We said that if there were only one chance in
four,&rdquo; Trotsky later wrote, &ldquo;that the Germans would not
or could not take the offensive, we should nevertheless seize the
chance.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Germans Attack</h4>

<p class="fst">Events in Germany gave reason to this position. In the middle of
January, great strikes broke out in Berlin. On the 18th, <strong>Pravda</strong>
appeared with headlines:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;It has happened! German imperialism&rsquo;s head
is on the executioner&rsquo;s block. The fist of the proletarian
revolution has been raised.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Revolution in Germany! A Soviet in Berlin!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The strike wave embraced Vienna, Berlin, Kiel, Hamburg,
Dusseldorf, Cassel, Leipzig, Halle, etc. Short-lived soviets appeared
in Vienna and Berlin. The munition factories were closed.</p>

<p><em>[With Trotsky&rsquo;s position adopted, the Brest-Litovsk
negotiations reopened. There was a strong faction among the German
tops to make peace with Russia in order to safeguard their own
crumbling war structure, but the kaiser made the decision for
presenting the Bolsheviks with an ultimatum. Up against the wall,
Trotsky made a final speech in which he announced that his delegation
would refuse to sign the proposed treaty but would also refuse to
recognize a state of war; the policy was to sit tight and depend upon
a German attack to unleash the volcanic forces of the German
revolution. But the German revolution was not yet ready, although
germinating.]</em></p>

<p>The German offensive encountered no resistance. The German troops
advanced along the railways without striking a blow. From February 18
to February 24, they occupied Reval, Rezhitsa, Dvinsk and Minsk; they
invaded the Ukraine.</p>

<p>Those were terrible days. When the offensive was announced, the
Council of people&rsquo;s Commissars wired the Germans its consent to
the peace treaty. For a time they thought the Germans were not going
to reply. Finally the latter answered evasively: &ldquo;Send your
proposals in writing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bolsheviks thought the Germans were making war not on Russia
but on the Soviets; that they had an agreement with the Allies for
the re-establishment of law and order in Russia; that they were going
to occupy a large part of the country, including Petrograd. The
remaining Russian troops retired in disorder before the Germans
without even taking the trouble to obey the instructions of the
Council of People&rsquo;s Commissars to destroy all their artillery
and munitions.</p>

<p>If the Germans refused to sign the peace treaty, there was nothing
left for the Soviet but to organize guerrilla warfare on the occupied
territory. On February 21, the socialist fatherland was proclaimed in
a &ldquo;State of Danger.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Strip for Action</h4>

<p class="fst">Orders were given to mobilize the entire strength and resources of
the country for revolutionary defense; to defend every position as
long as possible; to destroy the railways before the advance of the
enemy; to destroy food and munitions stocks, everything of value,
rather than abandon them; to mobilize the city masses to dig trenches
under the supervision of military experts: &ldquo;All able-bodied
adults, male and female, of the bourgeois classes must join this
work; all who resist will be shot&rdquo;; to suspend the publication
of all papers hostile to revolutionary defense and favorable to the
German bourgeois invasion or to the counter-revolution, the editors
and staffs of these newspapers to join in the work of defense; &ldquo;to
shoot on sight all agents of the enemy, speculators, thieves,
good-for-nothings, and counter-revolutionary agitators.&rdquo; The
embryo of the Red terror was contained in this document, as during
the French revolution the terror was born of foreign invasion and
danger to the state.</p>

<p>But the peasants did not want to fight. Lenin had founded his
whole breathing- spell thesis on this presumption, and it was now
proved to be a fact. The Germans advanced without resistance and took
possession of an immense booty. They advanced two or three hundred
kilometers in one week.</p>

<p>The Red Guard resisted here and there, but it was a desperate
resistance, doomed to failure. The passivity of the peasant soldiers
contrasted with the enthusiasm of the workers, who volunteered for
the defense by whole factories, together with their wives and their
older children. They poured into Smolny Institute in search of arms.</p>

<p>As for the rabid socialist patriots of yesterday, many of them
awaited the Germans as liberators.</p>

<p>Let us recall that the Red Guard under Antonov-Ovseyenko was
carrying on a brilliant campaign in the South and had captured Rostov
and defeated Kaledin, while the Red troops on the Rumanian front beat
off the Rumanian attack on Odessa. The terror was not yet in force,
for the masses did not favor terror to support a war they
disapproved.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Lenin&rsquo;s Realism Carries</h4>

<p class="fst">The capture of Pskov, 257 kilometers from Petrograd, brought
consternation to the capital.</p>

<p>The arrival of a new Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk on March 1
did not improve the situation. The Germans refused to end their
offensive until the very signatures were set to the treaty, which
they delayed until March 4 ...</p>

<p>When the recommencement of hostilities was announced, Lenin
proposed to the Central Committee the immediate signature of the
peace treaty. His motion was again defeated but by only one vote.
Bukharin, Trotsky, Joffe, Krestinsky, Uritsky, and Lomov voted
against him; Sverdlov, Sokolnikov, Smilga, and Stalin with him.</p>

<p>The Central Committee met twice the day after the German offensive
began. Two speakers were allowed each side on questions where there
were clearly defined differences. The speakers were limited to five
minutes. There was no time for long orations.</p>

<p>At the first meeting, Lenin was again defeated by seven votes to
six on a motion calling for the immediate resumption of negotiations,
after his view had been defended by Zinoviev and attacked by Bukharin
and Trotsky. At the second meeting, Trotsky informed them of the
capture of Dvinsk and the entry of the Germans into the Ukraine.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;We have started a revolutionary war in spite of
ourselves,&rdquo; Lenin said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t play with war!
This game has led us to such an impasse that the revolution will
inevitably collapse if you continue your middle-of-the-road attitude
any longer. Joffe wrote us from Brest-Litovsk that there was not
even the beginning of a revolution in Germany.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;While the Germans seize our stations and our
rolling stock, while our revolution is collapsing, we sit here
fiddling ... History will say that you gave up the revolution. We
could have signed the peace and been free, but now we have nothing;
we can&rsquo;t even blow up the railways, ...</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;The peasants don&rsquo;t want war and they won&rsquo;t
fight. Permanent peasant warfare is utopian. Revolutionary war must
be more than a phrase. If we are not prepared to fight, let us sign
the peace.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;The revolution will not be lost because we give up
Finland, Lithuania, and Esthonia to the Germans.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Terribly confirmed by events, Lenin&rsquo;s powerful realism
carried the last vote by seven to six. Trotsky&rsquo;s vote made the
difference. The division was as follows: For Lenin&rsquo;s motion for
an immediate peace: Lenin, Smilga, Sverdlov, Sokolnikov, Stalin,
Trotsky, and Zinoviev. Against Lenin&rsquo;s motion: Uritsky, Lomov,
Joffe, Bukharin, Krestinsky, Dzherzhinsky. One abstention, Helena
Stassova.</p>

<p>Neither Lenin nor the Central Committee thought of accusing
Trotsky of inconsistency; on the contrary, he and Lenin were charged
with drawing up the radiogram to the Germans. The demonstration he
wanted to make before the Western proletariat had been made; the
experiment he wanted to try had been tried.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Party Splits</h4>

<p class="fst">The situation became worse from hour to hour. The Germans were
slow to reply, but pursued their invasion with energy, collecting an
enormous booty.</p>

<p>And the party split! The leftist partisans of revolutionary war of
the Moscow District resigned their posts on February 20, &ldquo;reserving
the right to agitate for their point of view both inside and outside
the party.&rdquo; Among those who resigned were Lomov, Uritsky,
Bubnov and Piatakov.</p>

<p>It was the first step toward an open split. The part press did not
report these facts. After two days those who had resigned and the
remainder of the left bloc changed their attitude, but declared that
they would appeal to the party congress.</p>

<p>On February 22 Trotsky informed the Central Committee of a
proposal from the Allies: France and Britain were disposed to support
Russian resistance to Germany.</p>

<p>He thought the proposal acceptable provided the independence of
Soviet foreign policy was assured. Bukharin demanded that the Central
Committee reject the offer. Lenin was not present but sent a hurried
letter, a few scribbled words on a scrap of paper:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Please record my vote <em>for</em> accepting the
arms and support of the Anglo-French imperialist bandits. &ndash;
Lenin.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The Central Committee voted six to five for acceptance.</p>

<p>On February 23 the Central Committee discussed Von Kuhlmann&rsquo;s
answer. It announced new and much harsher terms: Russia was asked to
sign away the Baltic countries, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, the
Ukraine, and Finland!</p>

<p>Unshakable as ever, Lenin declared that he was through with
&ldquo;revolutionary phrasemongering.&rdquo; He threatened to
withdraw from the government and from the Central Committee if it
continued. &ldquo;Now we shall prepare for a revolutionary war,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>Trotsky considered that the division of opinion in the party made
a revolutionary war impossible and spoke for the peace but abstained
from the vote.</p>

<p>Lenin&rsquo;s policy carried by seven votes to four, with four
abstentions. Lenin, Stassova, Zinoviev, Sverdlov, Sokolnikov, Smilga
and Stalin voted for; Bukharin, Bubnov, Uritsky and Lomov against;
Trotsky, Dzherzhinsky, Joffe and Krestinsky abstained ...<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Democracy and Discipline: A Model</h4>

<p class="fst">All the responsibilities of the revolution rested on the party, or
rather on the leading circles of the party in Petrograd and Moscow.
How did it respond in this crisis?</p>

<p>Although it was a disciplined party without a tinge of abstract
democratic fetishism, during these grave hours especially every rule
of internal democracy was observed. The recognized leader of the
party was put in the minority. Lenin&rsquo;s great personal authority
did not prevent the members of the Central Committee from opposing
him and vigorously fighting for their own point of view.</p>

<p>The most important questions were settled by vote and often by
slight majorities (for example, 7 to 6), yet the minority submitted
without giving up its ideas. While in the minority, Lenin patiently
waited for events to bear him out and continued to agitate for his
policy without once breaking discipline.</p>

<p>Impassioned as the discussions might be, they were always
objective. Neither gossip, intrigue, nor personality played any
important role. The leaders defended their ideas without a thought of
attacking or discrediting their adversaries. They were purely
concerned with proving them wrong. Not being taunted, the opposition
showed only the minimum of nervousness compatible with events, and
rapidly recovered from its excesses.</p>

<p>When he had won a majority Lenin did not gloat. He had too much
else to do. He was at once tolerant and firm with the opposition &ndash;
tolerant toward their persons but immovable toward their ideas.</p>

<p>Unlike liberal bourgeois parliamentarians, Lenin did not make
distinctions between men and ideas. But, on the other hand, he did
distinguish between methods to be used in fighting enemies of the
party and methods to be used in internal party struggles, among
comrades. In 1917 his policy was based on a similar distinction
between struggles against enemies of the working class and struggles
inside the working class.</p>

<p>His idea of the working-class party leader was clear: a leader
whose authority was based on recognized superiority, a resolute and
disciplined man, stubborn and unafraid to be in the minority and swim
against the stream; the duty of the working-class leader was not to
follow the masses but to clarify and lead them, for he was the
highest expression of their intelligence.</p>

<p>Compare this idea of the proletarian leader with the idea current
in the old, petty-bourgeois, opportunist parties, in which the
leaders chase after the masses in search of popularity &ndash;
anti-militarists or pacifists when the masses are pacific, patriotic
when the masses cheer &ldquo;the war to end war,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; when they return in a murderous mood.</p>

<p>In this hour of danger the party was truly the &ldquo;Iron Guard&rdquo;
that Bukharin later called it: miracles of initiative from the lowest
to the top ranks, disciplined even to its greatest leader, admiring
and respecting the leaders it had formed during years of struggle,
but knowing how to contradict them and put them in the minority.</p>

<p>The party was equipped with a real collective leadership (always
Lenin&rsquo;s care), had a healthy tradition, and knew how to avoid
excesses both of democracy and authority. Tactical differences were
minimized by collective methods, common Marxist education, and
democratic centralist organization. The center directed and was
obeyed; but the center itself was the work of the party, and through
the party the masses.</p>

<p>If Lenin had been a little more authoritarian during the days of
Brest-Litovsk, or if the party itself had been a little less solid,
disciplined, loyal, and unified, or if the leadership had been a
little less flexible, intelligent, firm, and well-educated, the party
would have split and at least temporarily <A HREF="#n1" NAME="f1">[1]</A>
lost the aid of valuable leftist elements. A little more, a little
less &ndash; all living equilibriums repose on those quantities; so
does the equilibrium which is the health of the working-class party.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> But can it be known? Once he has
left or been expelled from the party, the best proletarian element is
more likely to be lost than to return. It requires an exceptional
theoretical ability and a not-at-all common strength of character to
continue to serve the party outside of the party. &ndash; <em>V.S.</em></p>
