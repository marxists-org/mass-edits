<hr class="section" size="1" nshade="" />
<p class="fst">The first Soviet government was set up at this same meeting [the
Second Congress of Soviets &#8211; <em>Ed.</em>] after a lively debate. The
congress elected a new All-Russian Soviet Executive Committee of 102
members: 62 Bolsheviks, 20 Left Socialist-Revolutionaries [S-Rs], and
several Internationalist Social-Democrats, besides various groups of
less importance. The first Council of People&#8217;s Commissars &#8211; the
term was proposed by Trotsky to avoid the now discredited appellation
of &#8220;ministers&#8221; &#8211; was composed solely of Bolsheviks ...</p>

<p>The Left S-Rs, prey of incessant hesitation, refused to enter the
Council of People&#8217;s Commissars although they were invited to do so
by the Bolsheviks, who had no desire to govern alone ... But the Left
S-Rs, those precious allies, in the name of the peasants they
represented, demanded a coalition government comprising every party
in the soviets, a government in which the Girondin
counter-revolutionists would have posts.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There was nothing for us,&#8221; says Trotsky, &#8220;but to
leave the Left S-Rs the task of persuading their neighbors to the
right to come over to the revolution. We believed it our duty to
assume all responsibility in the name of our party, while they
devoted themselves to that hopeless enterprise.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The Second All-Russian Soviet Congress dispersed on the morning of
October 27 after an all-night meeting. On the same day that it
addressed its peace proposals to all belligerent powers, the Council
of the People&#8217;s Commissars abolished the death penalty.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Junkers&#8217; Mutiny</h4>

<p class="fst">The insurrection was victorious. But the situation was desperate.
Petrograd had supplies for only a few days. None of the government
agencies functioned. The new government had neither offices nor
officials. Every hour delegates from the armies, the regiments, the
soviets in the provinces, and from trade unions testified to the
sympathy of the masses. But denunciatory telegrams also poured into
Smolny. General Headquarters, the Municipal Dumas, the provincial
councils, every former government body, in a word, announced to the
&#8220;usurpers,&#8221; to the &#8220;traitors,&#8221; to the &#8220;bandits who are
unleashing civil war&#8221; that order would be restored and the
insurrectionists punished.</p>

<p>The bourgeois newspapers continued to appear, filled with
sensational revelations of underhand plots, announcing the approach
of loyal regiments from the front, the presence of Kerensky at the
head of two army corps a few miles from the capital. A new
provisional government was set up in secret: counter-revolutionary
socialists, Mensheviks, and S-Rs prepared for a <em>coup d&#8217;etat</em>.
The central telegraph agency refused to send dispatches from the
People&#8217;s Commissars, the leaders of the railway workers&#8217; union
were hostile to the new government and sabotaged transportation. The
news from Moscow was confusing: street battles, negotiations, seizure
of the Kremlin by the Whites.</p>

<p>The &#8220;public&#8221; opinion of the bourgeoisie, of the middle
classes, of the foreign press was that the Bolshevik regime would not
last. At first they did not give it more than a few days, then
several weeks, then several months. The idea that the proletariat
would succeed in holding power seemed ridiculous.</p>

<p>A well-clothed mob filled the Nevsky Prospect, the central avenue
of the city, commenting on the news, predicting the reestablishment
of order, and jeering the Red Guard. Several isolated workers and
soldiers were slain.</p>

<p>The cadets of the military schools (the Junkers) suddenly occupied
the central telephone exchange. On the 28th day of October, the Red
Guard surrounded the engineers&#8217; club and the military school in the
center of the city where the Junkers were quartered. Armored cars
took up stations at the corners of these buildings. Artillery cannon
cast their thin shadows across the pavement. Summoned to surrender in
ten minutes, the Junkers replied with a volley of rifle fire. Their
resistance was broken by the first shell that tore a large gap in the
fa√ßade of the military school. Some of the Junkers tried to flee,
arms in hand. They were massacred.</p>

<p>Why did these sons of the petty bourgeoisie take up arms? One of
the leaders of the S-R Party wrote to General Krasnov who was
marching on Moscow: &#8220;Our forces consist of two or three hundred
Junkers and fifty party members armed with grenades.&#8221; The S-R
Party, which commanded the sole forces opposed to the proletariat,
had counted on supporting, inside the city, the military offensive of
Kerensky, of Krasnov, and of the GHQ from Mogilev.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Cossack Division Marches on Petrograd</h4>

<p class="fst">What forces did the &#8220;Leader of the Provisional Government,&#8221;
Kerensky, command in his quarters at Gatchina? What forces opposed
him? The troops of the Petrograd garrison, confident of the power of
agitation, showed themselves little disposed to fight. Many of the
officers were in hiding. The rest were hostile, with few exceptions.</p>

<p>At a meeting of officers called by the government, Lenin and
Trotsky were at first unable to find one single man willing to accept
the supreme command of the Red Army. Finally Colonel Muraviev
volunteered. He was a man of talent, energetic and ambitious. A
member of the S-R Party, he had put down, &#8220;Bolshevik leaders&#8221;
here and there in the army, but had ended up as a Left S-R. The
command was conferred on him, but a committee of five was appointed
to accompany him, to keep an eye on his activities, and to shoot him
at the first sign of treason. He proved to be loyal, filled with
energy, a good organizer, and a good soldier. With Trotsky he divided
the honors for the victory of Pulkovo. (The adventurer in him
triumphed at the end of a few months; commander in chief of the Red
Army on the Czechoslovakian front, he tried to escape to the enemy,
and when caught committed suicide.)</p>

<p>Other officers joined with him, frequently moved by their aversion
to Kerensky rather than by any attachment to the Soviets; their
contempt for democracy led them to adopt the political line of the
lesser evil. They were useful. Thus an old colonel, Valden by name,
was in command of the Red artillery that was instrumental in saving
the city from the heights of Pulkovo.</p>

<p>Everything had to be improvised. Sabotage had infected every
department of the army. Cartridges, shells, and replacement parts for
the cannon were all hidden, telephone and engineering apparatus was
lacking. The Red Guard and the factory workers supplied everything,
took every initiative, all the way from supplying the artillery with
ammunition to digging trenches.</p>

<p>Kerensky had taken refuge among General Krasnov&#8217;s Cossacks ...
In the city itself, the military uprising prepared by the S-Rs was to
clear the way. They occupied Gatchina and Tsarskoye-Selo, less than
fifteen miles from the capital. Only the heights of Pulkovo remained
between them and the city. [<em>But the Cossacks were demoralized and
beaten back by the Soviet forces.</em>] Krasnov himself was, in truth,
forced to surrender by his own Cossacks, who allowed the Reds to
occupy the Palace of Gatchina without putting up the slightest resistance.</p>

<p>The revolution made the mistake of showing magnanimity toward the
commander of the Cossack division. It would have been far better to
shoot him on the spot. He was set free a few days later on his word
of honor not to carry arms against the revolution. But what are
engagements of honor against the enemies of country and property? He
later put the Don region to fire and sword.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Counter-Revolutionary Socialism</h4>

<p class="fst">Nothing was more tragic than the collapse of the two great
democratic socialist parties. Strong in prestige, in influence among
the peasants, the intellectuals and the advanced middle classes, even
among a small group of workers, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party had
every opportunity for taking power within the bounds of legality and
for setting up a socialist government. The country would have
followed. The majority of the party, at the Fourth Congress, blamed
the Central Committee for not having done so.</p>

<p>The leaders of the S-Rs, ridden by a mania for formal democracy,
fearing mob rule above all, and dreaming of a parliamentary regime
that would give their noble eloquence a fitting stage, preferred the
road of collaboration with the liberal bourgeoisie to the more
arduous road to power. The S-Rs exerted a predominating influence on
Kerensky&#8217;s government. Kerensky himself was a member of their
party. So was the Minister of Agriculture, Chernov, the verbose
theoretician of populist socialism, who was the author of the program
of agrarian reform which he himself never ceased deferring. In the
Soviets the S-Rs, with the support of the Mensheviks, had had the
majority. They had the majority of the Moscow Municipal Duma; they
had almost half the votes in Petersburg. Their leader, Avksentiev,
presided over the Provisional Legislative Council of the republic.
They disposed of a strong army of active members. Their Central
Committee could unleash a wave of terrorists, offering themselves by
the hundreds as heroes and martyrs to the revolution. Had not the
autocracy once trembled at their very mention?</p>

<p>The Mensheviks, the minority of the Russian Social-Democratic
Labor Party, who had been at swords&#8217; points with the Bolsheviks for
more than twenty years in factional warfare &#8211; which was in reality
the war between revolutionary intransigence and socialist opportunism
&#8211; were influential in the industrial centers, among the
intellectuals, in the cooperatives, in the trade-union leadership,
and in governmental circles where they had such men, remarkable both
for their personal qualities and for their revolutionary past, as
Chkheidze and Tseretelli. They had gifted theoreticians and
agitators, such as the great founder of Russian Social-Democracy,
G.V. Plekhanov, such as Martov, Dan, and Abramovich. With the same
hesitation as the S-Rs, the Mensheviks pronounced themselves for
class collaboration, for democracy and the Constituent Assembly, and
against &#8220;anarchy,&#8221; &#8220;premature socialism,&#8221; &#8220;Bolshevik
hysteria,&#8221; and &#8211; &#8220;civil war&#8221; (<em>sic</em>).</p>

<p>In the Petrograd Municipal Duma on October 26, these two parties
took the initiative in forming the Committee for the Salvation of
Country and Revolution. They admitted three Cadets, representatives
of the big bourgeoisie, to the committee (Nabokov, Countess Panina,
and an unknown). The military organization of the S-R Party took
charge of the uprising of the Junkers, the students of the military
academies. Gotz appointed a colonel to lead the movement, and
Avksentiev signed the order to seize arms and start the battle. The
official journal of the S-R Party, <strong>Delo Naroda</strong> (<strong>People&#8217;s
Cause</strong>), announced that &#8220;the president of the party Central
Committee and honorary president of the All-Russian Peasant Soviet,
V.M. Chernov, is leading General Krasnov&#8217;s troops.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the disarmament of the Junkers, the Committee of Public
Safety, the Central Committee of the S-R Party, and the two signers
of the order to fight, Avksentiev and a Menshevik, in chorus
<em>disavowed</em> &#8211; to avoid the consequences so that they could
start all over again &#8211; the uprising they had provoked, and which
had cost the life blood of several hundred youths. The appeal of the
Committee of Public Safety distributed on October 27 had plainly
said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Resist this senseless adventure of the Bolshevik
Military Revolutionary Committee by force of arms. We call on all
troops faithful to the revolution to come to the Nicholas Military
Academy and join the Committee of Public Safety.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Not one single army unit replied to this appeal.</p>

<p>After this piece of underhanded trickery, the Girondin conspiracy
against the revolution took on a permanent character. Being more
active and better accustomed to illegal work, the S-Rs played the
dominant role.</p>

<p>Not that the Social-Democrats were any the less
counter-revolutionary. During the battle they had written: &#8220;In this
grave hour for Petrograd and for the entire country, the revolution
had received a terrible blow, not a blow in the back from General
Kornilov, but a blow right on the chest from Lenin and Trotsky.&#8221;
Conclusion: Workers unite, &#8220;to end civil war&#8221; (!) with the
Committee of Public Safety, that is, with reaction.</p>

<p>On November 3, nine days after the revolution, a Menshevik
conference met in Petrograd. Two opposing points of view were brought
out there, summed up by Abramovich:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The minority held it necessary to oppose Bolshevik
force with force, with bayonets. The majority said the Bolsheviks had
the sympathy of the masses of the proletariat and the army, and that
their suppression would drive the soldiers to black reaction and
anti-Semitism, would unleash the forces of the extreme right. The
majority held it necessary to end the civil war by conciliation.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;In the early days,&#8221; said Dan, &#8220;we counted on
ending the Bolshevik conspiracy by force of arms. The attempt failed
... That is why we took a more conciliatory attitude.&#8221; (Direct
quotation from Dan!)</p>

<p class="fst">These ferocious hangmen of the Russian proletariat were against
the civil war only as long as they could not win! Dan argued for a
policy that would tend to split the Bolsheviks, for approaching the
&#8220;reasonable Bolsheviks&#8221; for a democratic understanding, thus
isolating and finally crushing &#8220;the military faction around Lenin
and Trotsky.&#8221; The arguments of a certain Weinstein deserve to be
cited as an example of socialist casuistry in the service of
reaction: &#8220;If we do not suppress the Bolsheviks, even by force of
arms, someone else will do it, anyway.&#8221; Those who were for struggle
against all the Bolsheviks without discrimination, the
irreconcilables, outvoted Dan.</p>

<p>The men who spoke thus were not in the right wing of the party.
The right wing of Social-Democracy was composed of the
national-defense faction, with its newspaper <strong>Edinstvo</strong> (<strong>Unity</strong>),
and its leader, Plekhanov, the father of Russian Marxism, the Russian
Guesde. Sick and bedridden, old Plekhanov, receiving Jacques Sadoul
on October 17, said of the Bolsheviks: &#8220;We must not only master, we
must crush these vermin, drown them in blood. The salvation of Russia
is at stake.&#8221; Sadoul wrote to Albert Thomas:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Plekhanov is convinced that a showdown is coming soon,
and he awaits it impatiently, to the point of saying &#8211; mind you,
Plekhanov, whose democratic scruples you know &#8211; that if the uprising is
not spontaneous it must be provoked. The &#8216;Bolshevik bands&#8217; in his
eyes are &#8216;a horrible mixture of utopian idealists, imbeciles,
traitors, and anarchist provocateurs&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The pit into which Plekhanov had fallen was deep &#8211; bottomless,
in fact. At least he followed his national-defense position out to
its logical conclusion.</p>

<p>Maxim Gorky&#8217;s paper, <strong>Novaya Zhizn</strong> (<strong>New Life</strong>), then
neutral, described the policy of the &#8220;moderate democrats&#8221; in
these terms (speaking mainly of the socialists): their organizations
&#8220;invite all good citizens to refuse to obey the Bolsheviks, to
resist their orders actively, to sabotage and disorganize the supply
system. Their slogan is: &#8216;Against the Bolsheviks, anything goes!&#8217;&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Sabotage</h4>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Anything goes!&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Not mere words. The counter-revolutionary socialists made wide use
of a pitiless weapon usually considered outside of civilized
practice: the systematic sabotage of all enterprises serving the
general public, such as the food supply, public services, etc. From
its start, the class war violated the conventional forms of military law.</p>

<p>When the victorious Reds entered the Municipal Duma building in
Moscow, they found nothing but ruins. The ledgers had been used to
stop up the windows; the desks and filing cabinets were empty; the
typewriters out of commission. The city officials, sixteen thousand
of them, were on strike. Their strike against the workers&#8217;
revolution lasted four months, and that in a city already ravaged by
famine and epidemic before the insurrection.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;To get the city administration running again proved an
almost insurmountable task under these conditions. The total strike
of the city officials, doctors, teachers, and engineers was supported
by a business boycott and by sabotage from the new officials. But we
had to pay salaries (the civil and military administration of Moscow
employed more than two hundred thousand men), feed tens of thousands
of refugees, and keep the water, sewer, tram, slaughter, and electric
services going. These were the problems that suddenly confronted
inexperienced workers and party members, who could count on no assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The participation of a certain number of skilled workers in the
sabotage and strike marked the influence of the counter-revolutionary
socialists.</p>

<p>The same situation prevailed in Petrograd. The sabotage affected
the great national ministries. In the Agricultural Section of the
Ministry of Supplies, every single official and employee went on
strike, and took the current accounts along with them. The Supply
Section of the Soviet, a handful of workers, occupied the vast,
deserted offices of the ministry. Everything was gone.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Kalinin and I found several lumps of sugar in the
bottom of a filing cabinet,&#8221; wrote a comrade. &#8220;We made some tea
... The ministry had been deserted when it was captured by Schlichter
with a Red Guard unit ...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The strike at the State Bank started somewhat later, on November
14. A worker wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I found the building empty. Obolensky, Piatakov, and
Smirnov were sitting in one of the offices, trying to find some way
of obtaining some money to buy paper and ink for the Council of
People&#8217;s Commissars. They negotiated with the clerks and the one
lone official who had remained at his post ...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolsheviks finally had five million francs turned over to
them, after many formalities; V. Bonch-Bruyevich administered this
treasure with parsimony. In some of the banks the employees consented
to work, but fearing that they would later have to make good their
compliance, demanded the supervision of the Red Guard to save appearances.</p>

<p>Trotsky found the Ministry of Foreign Affairs deserted. A Prince
Tatischev consented to open the offices only after he was put under
arrest. The Commissariat of Foreign Affairs functioned at Smolny with
neither office nor personnel. Trotsky was preoccupied with military
affairs, and had only a very summary idea of foreign politics. &#8220;I
have taken this work,&#8221; he said, &#8220;only to be able to devote more
of my time to the party. My commission is limited: publish the secret
treaties, and close up shop.&#8221; Various documents were found to have disappeared.</p>

<p>Twelve office boys and one official remained at the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<p>To make a long story short: In every ministry, in every office, in
every bank the story was the same; and in the same way the most
important funds and documents had disappeared.</p>

<p>A clandestine government under the presidency of M. Prokopovich,
who had replaced the &#8220;missing&#8221; Kerensky, was formed. This secret
authority directed the strike of the officials in concert with the
strike committee. The largest commercial, industrial and banking
firms, such as the Tula Agricultural Bank, the Moscow People&#8217;s
Bank, and the Bank of the Caucasus, continued to pay the wages and
salaries of their striking employees. The old All-Russian Soviet
Executive, composed of Mensheviks and S-Rs, used the funds of the
Executive, which had been raised among the working class, for the
same purpose.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Initiative of the Masses</h4>

<p class="fst">&#8220;We need miracles of proletarian organization.&#8221; The solution
lay in these words of Lenin. The resistance of entire classes could
be successfully combated only by the initiative of energetic and
numerous masses.</p>

<p>The policy of the Bolsheviks in this period consisted mostly in
watching over. stimulating, sometimes guiding, more often sanctioning
the initiative of the masses. The People&#8217;s Commissariats were
ordered by decree &#8220;to work in close contact with the mass
organizations of the workers, women, sailors, soldiers, and
officials.&#8221; The decree of October 28 (November 10, New Style)
assigned the administration of local supplies to the municipalities.
Another decree of the same date urged them to solve the housing
crisis by their own methods, and gave them the power to requisition
and confiscate apartments. This decree was characteristic in its
sharp solution of the problem, without regard for the principle of
private property. A November 14 decree urged the workers&#8217;
committees to take over the control of production, accounting and
finance in the factories. As we know, the decree on land left the
initiative largely to the rural soviets.</p>

<p>As there was no central government, the initiative of the masses
accounted for everything. The Council of People&#8217;s Commissars was
nothing more than a very high moral authority. Shliapnikov wrote of
the council:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Its first sessions were held in Lenin&#8217;s little
office on the second story of Smolny. Its staff was quite small at
first: V. Bonch-Bruyevich and two or three assistants. I believe they
did not even take the minutes of the first few sessions.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The sessions were long. A tremendous number of practical problems
demanded immediate solution. They were discussed with delegations of
workers. The council decided that the People&#8217;s Commissars were to
receive the same wage as a skilled worker (500 rubles a month), with
an extra hundred rubles for each dependent. As the leader of the
revolutionary government, Lenin devoted himself to consolidating its
authority. He demanded that all formalities be observed, and observed
them himself, thus inspiring in his collaborators, and by diffusion
throughout the whole government, a feeling of power, confidence and respect ...<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Governmental Crisis</h4>

<p class="fst">During the insurrection itself in Petrograd, and all during the
street battle in Moscow, the Bolsheviks carried on negotiations with
the socialist parties. The Left S-Rs insistently demanded the
formation of a socialist coalition government; and as we shall see,
this proposal met the approval of numerous influential members of the
Bolshevik Party. The negotiations were opened by the All-Russian
Executive Committee of the Railway Workers&#8217; Union (Vikzhel), in
which the Mensheviks and Right S-Rs had a majority.</p>

<p>The Vikzhel was a sort of state within the state. On October 26,
while the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars was still without any real
authority, the Vikzhel was already supreme on all the railways. It
could stop the transportation of troops and munitions at its
pleasure, and it did. &#8220;Resolutely against civil war,&#8221; it equally
opposed, with a weak impartiality, the transportation of either Red
or White troops. The negotiations were carried on in the Petrograd
Municipal Duma, the center of the activities of the Committee of
Public Safety. Lenin and the majority of the Central Committee never
took the negotiations very seriously, although they preoccupied the enemy.</p>

<p>As long as the issue of battle in Moscow was undecided, the
Vikzhel and the democratic organizations around it demanded draconic
conditions of the Bolsheviks: (1) All troops to be placed under the
command of the Municipal Duma. (2) The workers to be disarmed and
Kerensky&#8217;s troops admitted to the city. (3) All political prisoners
to be released. (4) The Military Revolutionary Committee to be dissolved.</p>

<p>The victories of Moscow and Pulkovo led the Vikzhel to take a more
conciliatory attitude. The Bolshevik Riazanov, who was in favor of an
agreement with the Vikzhel, carried the new conditions of the
socialists to the All-Russian Soviet Executive (Vitsik).</p>

<p>They demanded a socialist ministry with not more than half the
posts filled by the Bolsheviks. They were willing to give the
Bolsheviks the Ministries of the Interior, Labor, and Foreign
Affairs, but at the same time they demanded that neither Lenin nor
Trotsky should be included. (This was according to the plan for
splitting the Bolshevik Party advanced by the Mensheviks). This
ministry was to be responsible to a Council of the Nation composed of
one hundred and fifty members from the All-Russian Soviet Executive,
seventy-five members from the peasant soviets, eighty delegates from
the army and the fleet, forty delegates from the trade unions, and
seventy socialist members of the Municipal Duma. A majority of one
hundred and sixty-five was promised the Bolsheviks.</p>

<p>Acceptance of this proposal meant veiled capitulation on the part
of the Bolsheviks. Their insufficient majority in the proposed
parliamentary assembly would lead to hesitant political action. The
power of the socialist minority, through its representatives in the
government, would enable it to sabotage all revolutionary measures.
This deception of the masses would weaken the Bolsheviks, while the
bourgeoisie and the middle classes became increasingly conscious of
their danger. The majority of the Bolshevik Central Committee,
counting on the unreserved support of the party and the masses of the
proletariat, turned the proposal down.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, there was a crisis in the Central Committee
and the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars. The Bulletin of the Central
Committee for November 5 said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The All-Russian Soviet Executive adopted the
resolution of Lenin-Trotsky on freedom of the press by thirty-four
against twenty-eight votes. The People&#8217;s Commissars; Nogin, Rykov,
Miliutin, Teodorovich, Riazanov, and Derbishev resigned. They
addressed the following statement to the Vitsik and to the Council of
People&#8217;s Commissars: &#8216;We believe it necessary to form a socialist
government embracing all parties in the Soviet. Only such a
government can ensure the fruits of the heroic struggle of the
working class and the army in October&#8211;November. We believe that a
purely Bolshevik government can maintain power only by the exercise
of political terror. The Council of People&#8217;s Commissars is taking
this course; we cannot follow.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Shliapnikov shared this view, but did not believe that he could
leave his post. &#8220;Kamenev, Rykov, Miliutin, Zinoviev, and Nogin
resigned from the Central Committee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The attitude of the remaining majority of the Central Committee
was set forth in two documents. The first was the answering address
of the majority to the minority, dated November 3:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The present political line of the party is contained
in the motion proposed by Comrade Lenin and adopted yesterday,
November 2, by the Central Committee. This motion considers as
treason to the proletariat any attempt to have our party divest
itself of the power with which it is invested on the basis of our
program by the All-Russian Soviet Congress, acting in the name of
millions of workers, soldiers, and peasants.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The minority was summoned to submit or leave the party.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;A split would be extremely unfortunate, but an open
and honest split would be preferable to sabotage inside the party,
the non-application of our own resolutions, disorganization and
prostration ... We do not doubt for a moment that if our differences
are brought before the masses, our policy will be supported without
reserve by the workers, the soldiers, and the revolutionary peasants,
and the hesitant policy of the opposition rapidly condemned to
isolation and powerlessness.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This statement was signed by Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Sverdlov,
Uritsky, Dzerzhinsky, Joffe, Bubnov, Sokolnikov, and Muranov.</p>

<p>Grave as it was, the crisis remained limited to the upper circles
of the party and was of short duration. In the All-Russian Soviet
Executive, Lenin made but short and disdainful mention of &#8220;the
departure of several intellectuals.&#8221; He added:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Only those who believe in the people, who throw
themselves into the trials of the living masses, will maintain power.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">On November 7 <strong>Pravda</strong> published an appeal to the masses, of
which the following were the important passages:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;May all those of little faith, the vacillaters and
skeptics, those who have let themselves be intimidated by the
bourgeoisie, or by their direct or indirect agents, be ashamed of
themselves. There is not a shadow of hesitation among the masses.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The members who had resigned were harshly criticized as deserters.
On the next day <strong>Pravda</strong> published a <em>Letter to the Comrades</em>,
signed by Zinoviev. Zinoviev stated that the Mensheviks and the S-Rs
had refused to accept the conditions of the Soviet, and that under
these circumstances he had decided to withdraw his resignation from
the Central Committee, and he urged his comrades in the opposition to
do likewise. He wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is our right and duty to warn the party against
mistakes. But we must remain with the party. We prefer to make our
mistakes with millions of workers and soldiers and suffer with them,
rather than cut ourselves off from the historical movement at this
decisive moment. There cannot and will not be a split in our party.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">History offers no other example of so grave a crisis in the
working-class movement so easily and healthily solved. The great
qualities of the Bolshevik party &#8211; its discipline, strong morale,
collective thinking, its frank exploration of differences, the
insignificance of personal pride among the members, and their strong
attachment to the working class and the organization &#8211; were
revealed once more ...<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Reliance on the Masses</h4>

<p class="fst">The Bolshevik proponents of a socialist coalition government
feared that the Bolshevik Party &#8211; which they were accustomed to
consider as the conscious <em>minority</em> of the working class &#8211;
would be isolated from the worker and peasant masses, if it took
power alone. They did not understand what immense influence the party
had gained since the July Days, nor the power contained in a policy
which conformed with the vital interests of the whole proletariat.
They feared civil war <em>within</em> the ranks of socialism; and their
fears were legitimate at the time. The counter-revolutionary nature
of democratic socialism had not yet been demonstrated, as it since
has been so abundantly in Russia and Germany.</p>

<p>It was legitimate but illusory to hope that the socialists would
hesitate to align themselves with the counter-revolution, to open
fire on what they themselves called a people&#8217;s uprising, to take
arms against the true socialists. The proponents of a coalition
government underestimated the democratic corruption of the socialist
parties, their domination by the bourgeoisie, the reactionary spirit
of their leaders, and the mentality and interests of their lower
middle-class memberships. This was a patent error, especially after
the edifying experience with democratic socialism in the war, when it
had lined up with the imperialist governments in every country of the world ...</p>

<p>Lenin appealed incessantly to the initiative of the masses. The
spontaneity of the masses appeared to him the necessary condition for
the success of the organized activities of the party. On November 5
he signed an appeal to the people inviting them to combat the
sabotage. The majority of the people is with us, and our victory is
certain, he said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Comrades, workers! Remember that from now on you will
run the state yourselves. No one will help you if you do not
yourselves unite and take over all state affairs ... Organize around
your soviets. Strengthen them. Get to work at the bottom, without
waiting for orders. Institute a severe revolutionary discipline.
Repress the anarchic excesses of drunkards, Junkers and
counter-revolutionists mercilessly. Take rigorous control of
production and administration. Arrest and deliver to the
revolutionary courts whoever prejudices the people&#8217;s cause ...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The peasants were urged to &#8220;take full power for themselves
instantly.&#8221; Initiative, more initiative, and yet more initiative!
That was the slogan Lenin gave the masses on November 5, ten days
after the victorious insurrection.</p>
