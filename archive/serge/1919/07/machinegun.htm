<p class="fst">At the gates of the homes, at the gates of the palaces &#8211; that we have conquered &#8211;<br />
everywhere in the city<br />
where the riot drags on cold, dull and strong,<br />
everywhere at the doors of our homes<br />
the machine-guns in the dark corners.</p>

<p class="fst">Dull, to bring death;<br />
blind, low, at the base of the earth,<br />
blind, cold, of steel, of iron,<br />
with the metal of their hate<br />
elemental,</p>

<p class="fst">with their steel teeth ready to bite,<br />
their clockwork,<br />
wheels, nuts, springs,<br />
their short black mouths on the mounts<br />
squat ...</p>

<p class="fst">Oh, the tragic machine, the thing of steel, of iron, inert, which mutilates seconds, at the fatal moment of battle,<br />
which digests seconds &#8211; tac-tac-tac &#8211; the<br />
seconds drop to the infinite &#8211; and lives<br />
tumble to the great cold of the tombs,<br />
The machine<br />
which eats, tears, bursts, pierces, excavates<br />
the flesh, becomes twisted in blood and nerves,<br />
breaks the bones, makes the rails sing with the hollow of perforated chests,<br />
makes the brain ooze with the breaking of great faces:<br />
grey among blackened blood.<br />
Low machine to kill, everywhere, in the town of dull riot,<br />
lurking at the doors of our homes, watching for what wants to be born,<br />
watching<br />
for what lifts from human hearts and from the depths of the live earth,<br />
for what rises from burning faith, from mad hope and from anger &#8211; from want and from light &#8211;<br />
from enthusiasm and from prayer,<br />
which goes up to flower &#8211; acts, cries &#8211; flames: the revolt ...<br />
Low to cut down flight, the machine-gun in ambush: victory to the man of iron laws,<br />
victory to metal on flesh &#8211; and in the dream &#8211; the law of death.<br />
And this machine, our hands and our brains built. O Father! Did we know what we made?</p>
