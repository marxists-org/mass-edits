<p class="information">The following is an excerpt from <i>Memoirs
of a Revolutionary</i> (1945) on the Kronstadt rebellion against
the Bolshevik autocracy&mdash;its dictatorship over the
proletariat. Despite Serge remaining an (albeit highly critical)
Bolshevik apologist and remaining in the camp of those who claimed
Kronstadt as "a tragic necessity", he is honest enough to describe the
facts of the situation in their own damning terms.</p>

<p class="information">For instance, the first act of the
Bolshevik hierarchy was to publicly lie about the nature of the revolt,
both to loyal party members and to the rest of society; they claimed
that it was a revolt of the White generals to restore the old regime.
This was the first lie of many about the rebellion that have been
perpetuated ever since by Bolshevik apologists. In the final part of
the article, Serge also gives a brief analysis of Marxist
social-democracy, the Bolshevik party internal structure, and its
relationship to the authoritarianism of the Bolshevik state. This
excerpt was reprinted in a US socialist magazine, <i>
Politics</i>, in 1945, and in the UK by <i>Solidarity</i>
as a pamphlet in 1961.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="h1">Solidarity Introduction</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The following text, hitherto unpublished in
Britain, first appeared in the American socialist paper <i>Politics</i>,
over 16 years ago. It describes the tragic Russian events of March,
1921.</p>

<p class="fst">The working-class had taken power three and
a half years earlier, in the greatest revolution of all time. But it
had seen that power slowly slip from its hands, first in the factories,
later in the Soviets. A new bureaucracy was emerging. Its core was the
Bolshevik party, whose patronage was becoming essential for accession
to all important posts, both in the economy and in the state.</p>

<p class="fst">With the final victories of the Civil War,
working class discontent, which had been smouldering for months, broke
out in the great Leningrad strikes of January and February 1921, and in
the Kronstadt uprising.</p>

<p class="fst">Serge describes an event in working class
history concerning which Stalinists, Trotskyists and sundry others have
indulged in a systematic campaign of misrepresentation and distortion.
He shows how certain ideas concerning 'the Party' worked out, in
practice. The article also exposes the hypocritical pretensions of
those who claim the struggle against the developing bureaucracy as some
kind of private mantle.</p>

<p class="fst">Serge's testimony concerning Kronstadt is
of great historical value. It is the testimony of a revolutionary who
was in Leningrad during those fateful days, who actively participated
in the scenes he describes, and who endorsed, at the time, the actions
of the Russian leaders.</p>

<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<p class="fst">During the night of February 28-29, I was
awakened by a phone call. "The Whites have taken Kronstadt", an anxious
voice told me. "We are fully mobilized". It was Ilya Ionov, Zinoviev's
brother-in-law. This was an appalling piece of news. If true, it meant
that Petrograd itself would soon be lost.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"What Whites? Where did they come from?
I can't believe it!"</p>

<p class="quoteb">"A general by the name of Kozlovski -"</p>

<p class="quoteb">"But what about our sailors? What about
the Soviet? The Cheka? The workers at the Arsenal?"</p>

<p class="quoteb">"I've told you all I know."</p>

<p class="fst">Zinoviev was in conference with the
Revolutionary Council of the Army, so I rushed over to the headquarters
of the Third District Committee. Everybody was looking pretty grim.
"It's fantastic. But it's true." "Well," I said, "we must mobilize
everyone able to walk. Immediately!" Someone replied, evasively: "Yes,
we must mobilize." But nothing could be done without instructions from
the Petrograd Committee. Several comrades and I spent the rest of the
night poring over a map of the Gulf of Finland. We got word that
small-scale strikes were spreading through the suburbs. Whites in front
of us, famine and strikes behind us! I left at dawn, and on my way out
of the hotel I ran into one of the maids, quietly leaving the building
with packages under her arm.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Where to so early in the morning,
grandmother? And with such a load?"</p>

<p class="fst">The old woman sighed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"There's going to be trouble. You can
feel it in the air. They will slit your throats, my poor boy, yours and
the others' too. They'll steal everything that isn't nailed down, just
as they did last time. So I'm packing off my belongings."</p>

<p class="fst">At intervals along the deserted streets
there were little wall posters announcing treacherous seizure of
Kronstadt by the counter-revolutionary general Kozlovski and his
accomplices, and summoning the workers to arms. But even before I
reached the District Committee headquarters I ran into several comrades
who had already turned out, Mauser in hand, and they told me that the
Kozlovski business was a contemptible lie: the Kronstadt sailors had
mutinied, and what we were up against was a naval rebellion led by the
Kronstadt Soviet. If anything, that was still more serious; and the
worst of it was the paralyzing effect of the official lie upon us. For
the party to lie to us this way was something new. "They had to do it
because of the mood of the people," some of my acquaintances explained.
But they were frightened too. The strike had become almost general.
Nobody even knew whether the street-cars would run.</p>

<p class="fst">Later that day I had a talk with my friends
in the French-speaking Communist group (I remember that Marcel Body and
Georges Hellfer were both present). We decided not to take up
arms&mdash;to fight neither against the hungry strikers nor against
the exasperated sailors. In Vassili-Ostrov, in a street white with
snow, I saw a crowd gather, mostly women. I watched it push its way
slowly forward to mingle with the military-school cadets sent there to
open up the approaches to the factories. Patiently, sadly, the crowd
told the soldiers how hungry the people were, called them brothers,
asked them for help. The cadets pulled bread out of their knapsacks and
divided it up. Meanwhile, the Mensheviks and the Left Social
Revolutionaries were blamed for the strike.</p>

<p class="fst">Leaflets distributed in the suburbs put
forward the demands of the Kronstadt Soviet. They added up to a program
for renewing the revolution. In brief: new elections for the Soviets,
with secret ballot; freedom of speech and freedom of press for all
revolutionary groups and parties; liberty for the trade-unions;
liberation of all revolutionaries being held as political prisoners; no
more official propaganda; no more requisitioning in the rural
districts; freedom of employment for artisans; immediate withdrawal of
the street patrols which were preventing free purchase of food supplies
by the general public. The Kronstadt Soviet, the Kronstadt garrison,
and the sailors of the First and Second Squadrons had rebelled to get
that program accepted.</p>

<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="h2">The Party Reflex: Lies and Threats</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Little by little, the truth broke through
the smoke screen laid down by the press, whose mendacity now knew no
bounds. And that was <i>our</i> press, the press of our
revolution, the first socialist press in history, therefore the first
incorruptible, unbiased press in history. Even in the past, to be sure,
it had now and then laid itself open, to some extent, to the charge of
demagogy (of a warm, sincere kind, however) and had used violent
language about its opponents. But in doing so it had stayed within the
rules of the game, and had, in any case, acted understandably. Now,
however, lying was its settled policy. The <i>Petrograd Pravda</i>
informed its readers that Kouzmin, Commissar for the navy and the army,
had been manhandled during his imprisonment at Kronstadt, and had
narrowly escaped summary execution&mdash;on written orders from the
counter-revolutionaries. I knew Kouzmin, an energetic, hard-working
soldier, a teacher of military science, grey from tip to toe; his
uniform, even his wrinkled face were grey. He "escaped" from Kronstadt
and turned up at Smollny.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"It is hard to believe." I said to him,
"that they intended to shoot you. Did you really see any such order?"</p>

<p class="fst">He looked embarrassed, and did not answer
for a moment.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Oh, one always exaggerates a bit. There
was a threatening note."</p>

<p class="fst">In short, he had let his tongue run away
with him. That was the whole story. The Kronstadt rebels had spilled
not a single drop of blond, had gone no further than to arrest a few
Communist officials, all of whom had been well treated. Most of the
Communists, several hundred in all, had gone over to the rebels, which
showed clearly enough how weak the party had become at its base.
Nevertheless, someone had cooked up this story about hairbreadth
escapes from the firing squad!</p>

<p class="fst">Rumors played an ugly part in the whole
business. With the official press carrying nothing but eulogies of the
regime's successes, with the Cheka operating in the shadows, every
moment brought its new, deadly rumor. Hard upon the news about the
Petrograd strikes, word reached Kronstadt that the strikers were being
arrested en masse, and that the troops were occupying the factories.
That was untrue, or at least greatly exaggerated, although the Cheka,
running true to form, had undoubtedly gone about making stupid arrests.
(Most of these arrests were for short periods.) Hardly a day passed
without my seeing Serge Zorin, the secretary of the Petrograd
Committee. I knew, therefore, how many worries he had on his mind, and
how determined he was not to adopt repressive measures against workers.
I also knew that, in his opinion, persuasion was the only weapon that
would prove effective in a situation of this kind, and how, to back up
his opinion he was bringing in wagon-loads of foodstuffs. He told me,
laughingly, that once he had found himself in a district where the
Left. Social Revolutionaries had popularized the slogan: "Long Live the
Constituent Assembly!"&mdash;which clearly was another way of
saying "Down with Bolshevism!". "I announced", he went on, "the arrival
of several wagons full of food. In the twinkling of an eye it turned
the situation upside down."</p>

<p class="fst">In any case the Kronstadt uprising began as
an act of solidarity with the Petrograd strikes, and as a result of
rumors (about repressive measures) which were mostly without foundation.</p>

<p class="fst">Kalinin and Kouzmin, whose stupid
blundering provoked the rebellion, were chiefly to blame. Kalinin, as
chairman of the Republic's Executive, visited Kronstadt, and the
garrison received him with music and shouts of welcome. But when the
sailors stated their demands he called them traitors, accused them of
thinking only of their own interests, and threatened merciless
punishment. Kouzmin bellowed at them: the iron hand of dictatorship of
the proletariat would strike down all infractions of discipline, every
act of treason! The two of them were booed and kicked out&mdash;and
the damage was done. It was probably Kalinin who, back in Petrograd,
invented "the White general, Kozlovski". From the very first, when it
would have been easy to patch up the differences, the Bolshevik leaders
chose to use the big stick. We were to learn later that the delegation
sent from Kronstadt to explain the issues at stake to the Soviet and
people of Petrograd had got no further than a Cheka prison.</p>

<p class="fst">Some American Anarchists&mdash;Emma
Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and a young man named Perkus, the secretary
of the Russian Workers Union in the United States&mdash;had arrived
a short time before. A scheme for mediation took shape in the course of
some talks I had with them on several successive evenings. When I told
some of the party comrades about it, they countered:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"That won't do any good. We're bound by
party discipline, and so are you".</p>

<p class="quoteb">I protested: "One can get out of a
party".</p>

<p class="quoteb">Cool, unsmiling, they replied: "No
Bolshevik deserts his party. And, anyway, where would you go? Ours is
the only party, to put it mildly."</p>

<p class="fst">The Anarchist mediation group used to meet
at the home of my father-in-law, Alexander Roussakov. Since the
Anarchists had the ear of the Kronstadt Soviet, it had been decided
that only Anarchists would take part in the negotiations, and that the
American anarchists alone would assume responsibility
vis-&agrave;-vis the Soviet government; so I was not present. Emma
Goldman and Alexander Berkman had an interview with Zinoviev. They were
received cordially, for they were still able to speak authoritatively
in the name of a section of the international proletariat. Their
mediation scheme, nevertheless, was a complete failure. As a sop,
Zinoviev offered them every facility for seeing Russia from a private
railway car. "Think it over and you will understand". Most of the
Russian members of the mediation group were arrested. I was
not&mdash;an indulgence which I owed to the good opinion that
Zinoviev, Zorin and a few others had of me, and to my position as a
militant in the French workers' movement.</p>

<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="h3">Why I Supported the Bolsheviks</a></h3>

<p class="fst">After much hesitation, my Communist friends
and I finally sided with the party. It was a painful step to take, and
this is why we did it: the Kronstadt sailors, we reasoned, were right.
They had begun a new freedom-giving revolution which would lead to
popular democracy. Certain Anarchists who had not outgrown the
illusions of childhood gave it a name: the 'Third Revolution'. The
country, by this time, was in bad shape. Production had come virtually
to a stop. Reserves of all kinds had been used up, including even the
reserves of nervous energy which sustain popular morale. The workers'
elite, formed in the course of the struggles under the old regime, had
literally been decimated. The party, its membership swollen by the
influx of bandwagon riders, inspired little confidence. And there was
nothing left of the other parties but tiny cadres, of doubtful ability.
Some of them, to be sure, might in a few weeks' time have put on flesh,
but only by admitting en masse the soured, the bitter, the
exasperated&mdash;very different types from the 1917 enthusiasts of
the young revolution. Soviet democracy had lost its vitality. It lacked
leadership. It had no organisational basis. And it had no defenders,
except among the hungry and desperate masses of the people.</p>

<p class="fst">The popular counter-revolution translated
the demand for freely-elected Soviets into the slogan "Soviets without
Communists!" If the Bolshevik dictatorship were to fall, we felt, the
result would be chaos: peasant putsches, the massacre of the
Communists, the return of the &eacute;migr&eacute;s, and,
finally, another dictatorship, of necessity anti-proletarian. The
dispatches from Stockholm and Tallinn showed that the
&eacute;migr&eacute;s were thinking in precisely these terms.
(These dispatches, by the way, strengthened the determination of the
leaders to put down the Kronstadt rebellion quickly, and without regard
to the cost.) Our thinking about all this had, furthermore, a factual
basis. We knew of fifty rallying-points for peasant insurrections in
European Russia alone. We knew that Antonov, the proponent of
Revolutionary Socialism of the Right, was active in the area south of
Moscow, and that he was preaching both the destruction of the Soviet
regime and the reinstatement of the Constituent Assembly. He had at his
command, in and around Tambov, a skillfully organized army made up of
several tens of thousands of peasants, and he had negotiated with the
Whites. (Tukachevsky liquidated this Vendee towards the middle of 1921.)</p>

<p class="fst">In these circumstances, the party should
have beat a retreat by admitting that the existing economic set-up was
indefensible. It should not, however, have given up power. "In spite of
its faults, in spite of its abuses, in spite of everything," I wrote at
the time, "the Bolshevik party, because of its size, its insight, its
stability, is the organized force to which we must pin our faith. The
Revolution has at its disposal no other weapon, and it is no longer
capable of genuine renewal from within".</p>

<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="h4">Comrade against Comrade</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The Political Bureau finally made up its
mind to enter into negotiations with Kronstadt, lay down an ultimatum,
and, as a last resort, attack the fortress and the ice-bound
battleships. As it turned out, no negotiations ever took place. But an
ultimatum, couched in revolting language, appeared on the billboards
over the signature of Lenin and Trotsky: "Surrender or be shot like
rabbits!" Trotsky, limiting his activities to the Political Bureau,
kept away from Petrograd.</p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile the Cheka had declared war on the
Menshevik Social-Democrats by publishing an outrageous official
document accusing them of "conspiring with the enemy, planning to
sabotage the railways," etc. The Bolshevik leaders themselves were
embarrassed; they shrugged the charges aside: "More of the Cheka's
ravings!" But they let the charges stand all the same and promised only
that there would be no arrests and that everything would come out
alright. Even so, the Menshevik leaders Dan and Abramovich were
arrested (in Petrograd): and the Cheka (led at this time, as I
remember, by a red-headed worker named Semionov, a hard, ignorant
little man) wanted to have them shot&mdash;on the grounds that they
had organized the strike, which was now almost general (and at least
75% spontaneous). I had just had a run-in with Semionov over two
students the Cheka had arbitrarily seized. I got word to Lenin through
Gorky (who was also at that moment intervening to save the Menshevik
leaders). Once Lenin had been informed, we knew our friends were out of
danger.</p>

<p class="fst">Early in March, Red Army troops advanced
across the ice against the Kronstadt fortress and fleet. The rebel
artillery opened fire on the assailants. Infantrymen wearing long white
parkas advanced in waves, and in some places the ice cracked under
them. Here and there a huge block of ice would break loose and, turning
slowly over, would carry its human cargo with it into the black depths
of the water. And then, comrade against comrade, the shameful slaughter
began...</p>

<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="h5">"We'll be Our Own Thermidor"</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile, in Moscow, the Tenth Congress of
the party, on Lenin's motion, had abolished the requisitioning system
('War Communism'), and put the NEP into effect. All the economic
demands of Kronstadt had been met! The Congress had, at the same time,
gone out of its way to heap abuse upon all the opposition groups. The
Workers' Opposition, for instance, had been described as an
"anarcho-syndicalist deviation with which the party cannot make terms",
although it was not Anarchist in any sense, and had advocated nothing
but trade union management of production (which, incidentally, would
have been a big step in the direction of workers' democracy). Finally,
the Congress had drafted its members, many of whom belonged to
opposition groups, for the battle against Kronstadt. The extreme Left
winger Dybenko, himself once a Kronstadt sailor, and the writer and
soldier Bubnov, leader of the group in favor of 'democratic
centralisation', went to do battle on the ice&mdash;against
insurgents with whom, deep in their hearts, they had no quarrel.
Tukachevsky was now preparing the final assault.</p>

<p class="fst">On one of these black days, Lenin said to a
friend of mine (I use his exact words): "This is Thermidor. But we
shall not let ourselves be guillotined. We'll be our own Thermidor."</p>

<p class="fst">The Orianienbaum incident is never
mentioned; but in my opinion it brought the Kronstadt rebels within
reach of a victory which they did not want&mdash;and might easily
have resulted in the fall of Petrograd. Serge Zorin, the blond Viking
who was secretary of the Petrograd Committee, noticed something
peculiar about the orders being given by one of the infantry
commanders. For instance, certain arbitrarily chosen cadets were kept
standing guard close to the artillery emplacements, and regroupings
were being effected for which there was no evident reason. After a
couple of days there was no longer any doubt that a conspiracy was
afoot. As an act of solidarity with Kronstadt, an entire regiment was
going to switch sides and call upon the army to rebel. Zorin
immediately ordered into the regiment men who could be counted upon,
doubled the number of sentry posts and the compliment of soldiers
assigned to each, and arrested the regiment's commanding officer, a man
who had spent many years as an officer in the Imperial Army. He was
brutally frank: "For years I had looked forward to that hour. I hate
you, you murderers of Russia. Now I've lost, life means nothing to me."
Along with a considerable number of his accomplices, he was shot. His
regiment, by the way, had been withdrawn from the front in Poland.</p>

<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="h6">The Cheka Takes Over</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The rebellion had to be liquidated before
the thaw. The final assault was launched by Tukachevsky on March 17 and
resulted in an audaciously-won victory. The Kronstadt sailors, fighting
without competent officers (one of their number, to be sure, was an
ex-officer named Kozlovski, but he played an unimportant role and had
no authority), made poor use of their artillery. Some escaped to
Finland; some fought a savage defensive battle, from fort to fort and
street to street, and died shouting. "Long live the World Revolution!"
Some even died with the cry: "Long Live the Communist International!"
Several hundred were taken into Petrograd and turned over to the Cheka,
which months later&mdash;criminally, stupidly&mdash;was still
shooting little groups of them. These prisoners belonged body and soul
to the revolution; they had given expression to the sufferings and will
of the Russian people; and there was the NEP to show that they had been
right! Furthermore, they had been taken prisoner in a civil war, and by
a government which for a long while had been promising an amnesty to
those of its adversaries who were willing to become its supporters.
Dzerjinski presided over this endless massacre&mdash;or at least
let it happen.</p>

<p class="fst">The Kronstadt leaders, men unknown up to
the uprising, were drawn from the ranks. One of them, Petrichenko,
escaped to Finland and may still be alive. Another, Perepelkin, turned
up later among some friends I used to visit at the old prison in
Shpalnernaya Street&mdash;through which so many revolutionaries,
Lenin and Trotsky, among others, had passed in days gone by. From the
depths of his cell, before disappearing finally from sight, Perepelkin
told us the whole story of Kronstadt.</p>

<p class="fst">That dismal March 18! The morning papers
had big headlines in honor of the proletarian anniversary of the Paris
Commune. And each time the cannon fired on Kronstadt, the window panes
rattled in their frames. In the offices at Smolny, everyone felt
uneasy. Conversation was avoided, except between close friends and even
they spoke sharply to each other. The vast Neva landscape had never
before seemed to me so bleak and desolate. (By a remarkable
coincidence, there was a Communist uprising in Berlin on that same
March 18, one whose defeat marked a turning-point in the strategy of
the International, from the offensive to the defensive.)</p>

<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="h7">The Great Ideas Die</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Kronstadt inaugurated a period of doubt and
dismay inside the party. In Moscow, a Bolshevik named Peniuchkin, who
had distinguished himself during the Civil War, pointedly resigned from
the party to found a new political movement&mdash;to be called, if
I remember correctly, the Soviet Party. He set up his party
headquarters in a street lined with workers' homes, and for a while
nothing was done about it. Then he was arrested. Several comrades came
to me and asked me to intervene on behalf of his wife and child, who
had been evicted from their home and were sleeping in a hall somewhere.
I was unable to do anything for them. The worker Miasnikov, another old
Bolshevik&mdash;he had taken part in the revolt in the Upper Volga
in 1905, and there was a close personal tie between him and
Lenin&mdash;spoke out in favor of freedom of the press "for
everybody, from the Anarchists at one extreme to the Monarchists at the
other". After a sharp exchange of letters he broke with Lenin, and
before long he was deported to Erivan, in Armenia. From there he went
to Turkey. I was to run into him in Paris some twenty years later. The
"Workers' Opposition" seemed to be heading towards a definite break
with the Party.</p>

<p class="fst">As a matter of fact, we were already well
on the way towards being overwhelmed by a nascent totalitarianism. The
word 'totalitarianism' itself had not come into existence yet; but the
thing it stands for was ruthlessly making itself our master without our
knowing it. I belonged to the ridiculously small minority which did
know. But the majority, both of the party's leaders and of its
militants, had come to regard 'War Communism' as a merely temporary
economic adjustment analogous to the highly centralized productive
arrangements which Germany, France and England had worked out during
the war. These centralization schemes had been called 'War Capitalism'.
So the majority believed that once peace was restored the state of
siege would automatically dissolve, and that we would then get back to
some kind of Soviet democracy&mdash;what kind it was no longer
possible to say.</p>

<p class="fst">The great ideas of 1917, the ideas which
had enabled the Bolshevik party to sweep along with it the peasant
masses, the army, the working class and the Marxist intelligentsia,
were certainly dead. Had not Lenin, in 1917, argued in favor of a
Soviet press so free that any group able to muster 10,000 supporters
would be allowed to publish its own newspaper, and at public expense?
Had he not written that the transfer of power from one party to another
within the Soviets could be accomplished peacefully, without sharp
conflicts? Had he not held out, in his theory of the Soviet State, the
promise of a form of political organization entirely different from the
old bourgeois States, with "no functionaries and no policemen, apart
from the people themselves"?&mdash;a State in which the workers
would exercise power directly through their own militia system? What
with the monopoly of power, the Cheka, and the Red Army, all that was
left of this dream of a 'State-Commune' was a myth, of interest only to
theologians. War, measures of internal defense against
counter-revolution, and famine (leading to creation of a bureaucratic
machine to take care of rationing) had put an end to Soviet democracy.
How and when would it be reborn? The party nourished itself precisely
on the belief that the slightest relaxation of its grip on power would
give the reaction the opportunity it was waiting for.</p>

<h3><a name="h8">The Totalitarian Potential</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In addition to these historical factors,
there were important psychological factors. Marxism has meant different
things in different periods. The child of bourgeois science and
philosophy on the one hand and the revolutionary aspirations of the
proletariat on the other, it makes its appearance at a time when
capitalism is entering upon its decline. It puts itself forward as the
natural heir of the society which gave birth to it. Just as
capitalist-industrialist society tends to draw the entire world into
its orbit, and to bring each and every aspect of life into conformity
with its value, so the Marxism of the beginning of the twentieth
century seeks to re-make everything&mdash;the system of property
holding, the way production is organized, the map of the world
(abolition of frontiers), even man's inner life (displacement of
religion). Since its objective was a total transformation it was,
etymologically speaking, totalitarian. It included within itself both
aspects of the society that was coming into being: the democratic and
the authoritarian. The German Social-Democratic party, largest of the
Marxist parties through the period 1880-1920 adopted a bureaucratic
form of organization modeled upon the State itself. It devoted itself
to the conquest of power within the bourgeois State, and wound up
thinking in terms of State Socialism.</p>

<p class="fst">Bolshevik thought takes it for granted that
truth is its peculiar possession. To Lenin, to Bukharin, to Trotsky, to
Preobrajensky, to many another thinker I could mention, the materialist
dialectic of Marx and Engels was at one and the same time <i>the</i>
law of human thought and <i>the</i> law of the natural
development of societies. The party, quite simply, is the custodian of
truth; any idea at variance with party doctrine is either pernicious
error or backsliding. Here, then, is the source of the party's
intolerance. Because of its unshakable conviction of its exalted
mission, it develops astonishing reserves of moral energy&mdash;and
a theological turn of mind which easily becomes inquisitorial. Lenin's
'proletarian Jacobinism', with its disinterestedness, its discipline in
both thought and action, was grafted upon the psychology of cadres
whose character had been formed under the old regime&mdash;that is
to say, in the course of the struggle against despotism. It seems to be
unquestionable that Lenin chose as his co-workers men whose temperament
was authoritarian. The final triumph of the revolution eased the
inferiority-complex of the masses&mdash;the always bullied and
always downtrodden masses. At the same time, however, it awakened in
them a desire for retaliation; and this desire tended to make the new
institutions despotic also. I have seen with my own eyes how a man who
only yesterday was a worker or sailor gets drunk on the exercise of
power&mdash;how he delights in reminding others that from now on
he's giving the orders.</p>

<h3><a name="h9">"The Danger Was Within"</a></h3>

<p class="fst">These same considerations explain some of
the contradictions with which the leaders themselves (despite the
verbal and sometimes demagogic solutions which the dialectic enables
them to put forward) have wrestled in vain. On a hundred different
occasions Lenin paid democracy high praise, and insisted that the
dictatorship of the proletariat is both "a dictatorship against the
expropriated expropriators" and "the broadest workers' democracy". He
believed it, wanted it to be true. He went into the factories to give
an account of his stewardship. He wanted to face all-out criticism from
the workers... But he wrote in 1918 that the dictatorship of the
proletariat was by no means incompatible with personal power, and by
doing so justified in advance some kind of Bonapartism. When his old
friend and co-worker Bogdanov came forward with embarrassing
objections, Lenin had him locked up. He outlawed the Mensheviks on the
grounds that they were 'petit-bourgeois' socialists who made themselves
nuisances by always being wrong. He welcomed the Anarchist spokesman
Makhno, and tried to convince him of the validity of Marxist doctrine;
nevertheless, Anarchism was outlawed too&mdash;if not on Lenin's
initiative, at least with his consent. He ordered a hands-off policy
towards the churches, and promised believers a truce; but he kept on
saying that "religion is the opium of the people". We were advancing
towards a classless society, a society of free men; but the party never
missed an opportunity to remind people that "the reign of the workers
will never end". Over whom were the workers to reign then? And that
word 'reign'&mdash;what does it mean anyhow?
Totalitarianism&mdash;and within ourselves!</p>
