<h4>Selections from <em>Ethiopia: A Cultural History</em></h4>

<h3>Author's Preface</h3>

<p class="fst">
In this book I have attempted a survey of Ethiopian culture
from the earliest times in its divers branches: language and
literature, music, architecture, painting and the applied
arts, pedagogy and the schools, the ethical and religious ideals
which have been the mainspring of all the arts.
</p><p>
I have sought to describe these creative activities in the setting of Ethiopian history, often fraught with heroism and peril,
often disturbed by invasions which have ruthlessly destroyed
much of the earlier achievement of Ethiopian genius and have
resulted inevitably in a sad impoverishment, militating against
the resurgence which nevertheless has always followed, rising
again after every reverse however terrible.
</p><p>
By numerous illustrations of the visual arts culled from many
sources, by extracts from literature and some few examples of
music I have endeavoured to bring the arts and ideals of
Ethiopia vividly before the enquirer.
</p><p>
Many of the beautiful photographs here included were
specially taken for me by the generous aid of their Excellencies
Bitwoded Andargatchau Massai, then Governor of Gondar, of
Ato Makonnen Hapte Wold, Minister of the Press, and of Ato
Akalrwork, Minister of Education.
</p><p>
In so wide a survey much has inevitably been omitted; I am
conscious of many imperfections, but I offer the work in the
sincere belief that it will reveal and co-ordinate many aspects of
the cultural life and the indigenous achievement of the Ethiopian people.
</p><p>
The book has been written for the general reader. It may be
in many cases a first introduction to Ethiopiana. Nevertheless I hope it will prove not without interest to those who have
already a knowledge of the country and have devoted attention
to Ethiopian studies. I should be happy if it might convey to
others some of the pleasure and interest I have derived from
writing it.
</p><p>
I may venture to recall that before I became immersed in
efforts for social betterment, my earliest interests were in painting and the decorative arts. As holder of a Proctor Travelling
Studentship, I was privileged to study at Venice and Torcello
examples of Byzantine Art, which like that of Ethiopia is of the
Middle East artistic family, as well as the other Italian Schools.
Subsequently as winner of a National Scholarship I studied
architecture and painting at the Royal College of Art in constant proximity to the art collections of the Victoria and
Albert Museum. Much later I was invited as English translator
of the works of the Roumanian poet, Eminescu, to be present at
the unveiling of the statue of that immortal bard on the shore of
the Black Sea. I was able then to visit many of those interesting
Roumanian churches both ancient and modern, wherein the
exterior and interior wall paintings preserve much of the style
of early Christian art which emanated from the Middle East.
The paintings in those Roumanian churches have strong
affinities with the art of Christian Ethiopia.
</p><p>
It is gratifying to be able to include in this volume photographs of the remarkable discoveries in northern Ethiopia
recently made during the archaeological researches initiated by
the Emperor Haile Sellassie and carried out under the auspices
of the Ethiopian National Library by Monsieur Jean Doresse.
Among a number of ancient objects unearthed from a cache at
Azbi-Dera is the effigy of an ancient sovereign, whose empire,
as shown by inscriptions on the base of his throne and on a
bronze votive sceptre buried with him, comprised both Saba in
Arabia and also several provinces in the area of the present
Ethiopia, which at that time played the predominant role in the
combined realm. Bronze bowls manufactured in Egypt of the
Pharaonic Saite period (697-523 B.C.), found in the same
cache, indicate that these discoveries extend our perspective of
Ethiopia's ancient history to approximately the sixth or
seventh century B.C. Thus is strikingly confirmed the contention of Professor Heinrich Muller that the inscriptions at the
ancient Ethiopian temple of Yeha, impressions of which were
submitted to him by Theodore Bent in 1893, must be ascribed
on palaeographic grounds to not later than the seventh century
B.C.
</p><p>
The precious treasure-trove of Azbi-Dera seems to extend a
golden bridge toward the remote era of King Solomon and
toward the earnestly held belief that it was an Ethiopian Queen
who journeyed "from the ends of the earth" to learn of his
wisdom.
</p><p>
The period of the wonderful monoliths at Aksum, which
resemble no others in the world, has yet to be elucidated by the
further researches now proceeding. The recent excavation of
their architectural ensemble will assist in bringing to modern
knowledge something of the transcendent spectacle they presented in ancient times. The one solitary example which has
remained erect across the centuries makes an unforgettable
impression by its majestic loveliness. Some of its companions
which have fallen were even loftier and more elaborate than the
standing tower. The architectural decoration of these amazing
monuments is no mere product of fantasy, but accurately represents the structural features of then contemporary Aksumite
buildings skilfully adapted to suit the slender shape of the
monotliths to form a handsome decoration wherewith to
beautify them.
</p><p>
The wars of invasion which repeatedly ravaged Ethiopia
destroyed the greater part of her early mediaeval architecture;
nevertheless some few churches, preserved in the seclusion of
caves and on the inaccessible heights of lofty flat-topped mountains, indicate that the traditional style of building already
established at Aksum and reproduced on the great monoliths
was continued and developed for more than a thousand years.
Notable survivals of the Aksumite building style are also found
among those other unique wonders, the monolithic churches of
Lalibela hewn from the living rock of the mountain and begun
toward the close of the twelfth century. I have devoted in these
pages considerable attention to the persistence of this traditional style, which is carefully explained in the text, as well as
by diagrams and photographs.
</p><p>
The various types of church building, basilican and round,
wed and illustrated in the following chapters.
</p><p>
I have devoted some space to the examination of the current
assertion that the famous Gondar castles are of Portuguese
origin.  Their sturdy construction and their austerity are alike
in striking contrast to the ornate baroque edifice produced on
the shore of Lake Tana by the Jesuit Father Pero Pais and his
unknown assistants. I would briefly observe here that in all
Gondarine structures there are features reminiscent of
earlier Ethiopian buildings, notably the capitals and their
mouldings and the Ethiopian seven-pointed cross, which is an
ever-recurring motif on the walls at Gondar, and is found at

St Mary of Zion, St George at Lalibela and countless other churches. It may moreover be recalled that the Jesuit Fathers and numbers of their compatriots were expelled from Ethiopia by the Emperor Fasiladas (1632-65) before he had laid the foundations of the first of the Gondar Castles.
</p><p>
Jacques Poncet, the French physician, who spent the years 1698-1700 at Gondar, before all the castles were yet completed, has nothing to say of Portuguese builders being employed on the work. James Bruce, who arrived in 1769, is equally silent about any building by the Portuguese, but he tells us the Emperor Yasu II (1730-55) employed several Greek artists&#8212;Christian refugees from Smyrna&#8212;in the decoration of his castle and that its ceiling was the work of Ethiopian Jews, <em>Falashas,</em> who were resident in the city.
</p><p>
Mural painting in Ethiopia has only latterly begun to be studied with the attention it merits; good interior photographs are difficult to obtain but I have been able to reproduce from Adowa some effective pictures of the characteristic murals of Aleka Lukas of Gojjam and also a beautiful painting from the Church of Medhane Alem in that historic town.
</p><p>
I have reviewed in these pages the works of many early writers, investigators and travellers, from the time of the unknown author of the <em>Periplus</em> in the first century A.D. onward, to whom all who write on Ethiopia to-day are indebted. Cosmas Indicopleustes, who in the sixth century reproduced in his <em>Christian topography</em> the Greek version of the trilingual inscription of an Ethiopian sovereign which he had copied at Adulis, took the first step toward placing Ethiopic studies in Europe on a realistic foundation, for the most authentic source of information concerning a people must ever be the works which they have themselves produced. Henry Salt at the dawn of the nineteenth century discovered the epigraphic inscriptions at Yeha and Aksum. Theodore Bent in 1893 brought home further and more accurate copies of these important records. Enno Littmann and his
colleagues of the German Aksum Expedition (carried out under the Emperor Menelik II) advanced archaeological studies much further. I am glad to publish here drawings and photographs from their magnificent report, as well as many photographs taken for me during my visit to Aksum.
</p><p>
Ethiopian scribes and translators, working in Rome in a 
house in the Vatican behind St Peter's Church, as Ludolphus
records, "above a hundred years" before his arrival there in
1649 were the first to convey a knowledge of the Ethiopic language and literature to a few European scholars. Already
through their efforts with the aid of Joh. Potken, the Ethiopic
Psalter had been printed in 1513 and the Ethiopic New Testament and Liturgy in 1548. It was the learned Ethiopian
Gregory Malkana Sellassie who instructed Ludoiphus and enabled him to write the first authentic history and account of
Ethiopia	ever produced outside the country itself which is in
many respects the finest ever written in Europe. The learned
Gregory must be regarded as at least the co-author of that invaluable work.
</p><p>
I owe many a debt to the narrative of the genial Father
Francisco Alvarez, the Portuguese Chaplain, as well as to the
Jesuit fathers who followed him to Ethiopia, particularly Pero
Pais, whose memoirs have been recently published by the Livaria Civihiza&#231;ao of Portugal and which I was able to study
with the assistance of Dr A. Nogueira Santos. By the kind
Hospitality of H.I.H. Princess Tenagne Work, then resident at
Gondar, I was able to examine the ruins of the church Pais
built on the shore of Lake Tana and to compare it with the Castles of Gondar, as well as to obtain the photographs of all
these which are published in this volume.
</p><p>
I have quoted many passages from Alvarez; his description
of churches now destroyed, his expressions of reverence for the
ascetic life of the Ethiopian monastery as he saw it. I have
included his observations on the Queen of Sheba, of whom he
heard much in Aksum. He claims to have found his story of her
visit to King Solomon in an ancient Ethiopian book, but the
tale he tells has no place in the Ethiopic Kebra Nahast wherein
the history of the famous Queen is recorded according to Ethiopian annals. The story Alvarez gives was in fact current in
Europe in his time. It appears in the Legenda Aurea of Jacobo
Voragine, which provided the theme for the magnificent
frescoes of Piero della Francesca in the Church of Francesco at Arezzo, circa 1452-64.
</p><p>
I am indebted to Jacques Poncet for his account of Gondar in
the height of its magnificence, and to James Bruce, the friend of
the gracious Empress Mantuab who brought back with him to
Europe the long-lost Book of Enoch with other important

Ethiopic works and thereby gave a new stimulus to Ethiopic
studies.
</p><p>
To the immense work of the many translators: Dillmann,
Charles, Budge, Hal&#233;vey, Weld Blundell, Rossini, Wolf Leslau
and many more, who have made available in European languages an extensive store of Ethiopian literature I pay my
tribute. The systematic work of translation from manuscripts
not hitherto accessible, which has been initiated by the
Emperor Haile Sellassie, will shed further light on the history
of the Ethiopian people and their contribution to the culture of
former times.
</p><p>
The discerning traveller who records what to citizens of a
country appears commonplace performs a service to posterity.
The diaries of the Protestant missionaries, Gobat, Isenberg and
Krapf, have provided me with a wealth of interesting material
concerning life, lay, ecclesiastic and scholastic, the customs of
the cottager and of the courts of Gondar and Shoa in early
nineteenth-century Ethiopia. The account Dr Krapf gives of
the young heir to the Kingdom of Shoa receiving the education
which was to prepare him for his future responsibilities from a
learned sage in the seclusion of a mountain peak has the quality:
of a Greek legend.
</p><p>
Charles Johnston, the young British naval surgeon, whose
attractive volumes have long been out-of-print, gave me an
intimate view of the arts, crafts, medicines and recreations of a
Shoan village in the early 1840s, as well as a pleasant glimpse of
a monastic university.
</p><p>
I should emphasize that the old crafts are still practised in
Ethiopia and that each province and district has its own
specialities in basketry, woodwork, leatherwork, ivory, horn,
silver and goldsmiths' work, ornaments, furniture and utensils
for the home, waterbottles for the journey, implements for
agriculture and the chase.
</p><p>
The report of the French Scientific Mission (1839-42),
beautifully published under official auspices and now rare,
presents a systematic and extensive survey of all the arts, crafts
and professions of that period. Enthralled by Quartin-Dillon's
account of the ladies of the <em>grand ton</em> at Gondar in his time, I have translated a portion of it for the pleasure of my readers.
The able artist Vignaud proves himself a veritable Cennini in
his description of the pigments used by Ethiopian painters.
</p><p>
From A.B. Wylde's vivid picture of the Jeweller of Emperor
Yohannes in the 188os I have notes of the handicraft at that period.
</p><p>
The detailed account of the Traditional Ethiopian church
schools of music, poetry, theology, history and philosophy, here published contains material largely unknown outside Ethiopia. I am grateful for the precious assistance I received in
preparing this chapter from His Grace Bishop Theophilus of
Ethiopia as well as from the Rev. Father Meshesha, and
Debtera Jamberra who kindly advised me on the work during
their visit to London.
</p><p>
I am thankful also to Ato Menghestu Lemma for much helpful information, for the translations of K&#233;n&#233; poems he made for
me and the church music he sang from the sixth-century music-writing of Yared the Deacon's Tsoma Deggua, which was kindly
transcribed in European notation for this volume by the able young violinist Louis Yffer. I must express my thanks also to
Abba Tita who sang for me an old Ethiopian hymn and to
Mr. H. Tims who transcribed it. This part of the book will be
new to the majority even of scholarly readers. The music I hope
is but a foretaste of much to follow.
</p><p>
The K&#233;n&#233; poem, as it has evolved in modern times, with its
its hidden meanings and frequent ellipses, is in marked contrast to
such ealier works as the majestic fifteenth-century "Weddase
Mariam". Rich and varied in its splendid images as the silk and
gold embroidery of an Ethiopian ceremonial robe, the sonorous
musical cadences  of this great hymn are apparent even in
in translation:
</p><p class="quoteb">
Not gold and silver I offer unto thee, nor the brilliant pearl,

<br>
But beautiful praise with the pure glorification which can be
offered unto thee and thy majesty, O Queen;
<br>
Not robes of honour of purple and silk adorned with divers
inlutirs of brocade,
<br>
I	lay out my soul before thee in place of glorious apparel
	decorated with gold,
<br>
And to thee I declare my sin, O Mother of the great High
Priest&#8230;<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*&#160;&#160;*&#160;&#160;*
<br>
Oh, how difficult it was to make the fullness of all the world to
to in a manger!
<br>


The manger was higher than the height of the heaven a
more extended<br> 
&#160;&#160;than its boundaries</p>
<p>
The modern <em>K&#233;n&#233;</em> is not of this genre; it has nothing of this
spaciousness. In its extreme brevity, though totally different in
style of course, it recalls rather the miniature poems of the
Japanese, the <em>tanka</em> consisting of 31 syllables only, which are
arranged in verses of 5, 7, 5, 7 and 7 syllables, the still briefer
<em>haiku,</em> comprising a mere i syllables in verses of 6, 7 and
5 syllables, and the more popular maya having five or six couplets
of five and seven syllable verses. Though the analogy cannot be
carried far, the acrostics of the <em>tanka</em> may be held to bear some
superficial resemblance to the much-prized hidden meaning
often imbedded in the <em>K&#233;n&#233;</em>.
</p><p>
In their own special style, it would seem that the Ethiopian
<em>K&#233;n&#233;</em> schools have followed to a certain degree an evolution
similar to that of modern Western poetry, wherein, too, subtlety
often approaches obscurity.
</p><p>
While other types of Ethiopian poetry are richer and more
spacious than the <em>K&#233;n&#233;</em>, within the framework of its exiguous
economy of words there is often a poignancy and force which
greater prolixity might not achieve. One may cite as an ex
ample the austere poem of Aleka Lemma:
</p><p class="quoteb">

For which hour and for what<br>
Did God keep the power of his horses, the Cherubim?<br>
And wherefore spake Christ with pride of His Father's house<br>
Through the smoke of jealousy fills the Temple, the heart of
<br>
&#160;&#160;the Jews?<br>
Because his horse is the soulless cross<br>
And his lodging the narrow, new-made grave.</p>
<p>
The prophetic <em>K&#233;n&#233;</em> written on the eve of the battle of Adowa
is also a work of power:
</p><p class="quoteb">
Sodom and Gomorrah, lands of retribution, shall find pardon
<br>
&#160;&#160;in the terrible day of battle;<br>
But you, base city of Rome,<br>
That has come upon you which did not come upon Sodom,<br>
For Menelik, saviour of the world,<br>
Has sent you swathed in blood to visit Dathan and Abiram<br>
&#160;&#160;in the grave;<br>
Not even one of your seed will he leave to bear your name&#8230;</p>



<p>
Bitter irony and rugged courage characterize the <em>Asare Negus</em> of the famous poet Kifl&#233; Johannes, who wrote in the time
of the Emperor to whom his satire is addressed:</p>
<p class="quoteb">
Impartial justice is is practised, O Bakuffa, in your good reign,<br>
While the poor man says says,<br>
"What we have heard, we have heard".<br>
Let your justice shine like the sun,<br>
For all office and honour under the sky<br>
Is for those who have money.</p>
<p>
In describing the literature used in the traditional School of
Reading I have endeavoured to show the sort of studies in
which Ethiopian theological students were engaged and very
briefly to indicate to the general reader, as occasion offered, the esteem in which the authors there read are held among theologians of the West.
</p><p>
I have not entered into the subtle mysteries of the monodyophysite controversy which occasioned one of the deeper
rifts in the United Christendom of the first four centuries.
Arguments concerning the mystic synthesis of the divinity and
humanity of Jesus Christ which convulsed the Church in former
times to-day appear obscure and remote to the ordinary man and woman. Even the clergy are more preoccupied with the
challenge of rationalism and the advance of scientific discovery. Dean Stanley<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1</a></sup> in the 1880s described the Monophysite interpretation of the Creed of Nicaea as an exaggeration of the
Orthodoxy of Athanasius, the great Alexandrian Patriarch, for
he suffered persecution and now is sanctified. Canon Douglas,<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2</a></sup> on the other hand, declared the Monophysite schism
was essentially national, not religious, an expression of the
"desperate struggle" of the "highly cultured religio-nationalities of the Near East, the Egyptian and the Syrian, and with
them ultimately the Armenian, against denationalization by
assimilation" to the Greco-Latin supra-nationality of the Roman Empire. The Ethiopian Church early affiliated to the
Alexandrian See of St Mark and closely associated also with the
Syrian Church was inevitably reckoned within the Monophysite fold. Yet there seem to have been from time to time
periods of controversy between factions of the clergy on this and 


other theological problems, as well as sections also who deprecated such disputes.</p>
<p>
I have elected to reproduce in these pages, as representing
the opinion of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the confession
of faith issued by the Emperor Galawdewos in 1557 to confute
the Latin prelate, Oviedo, whom Pope Julius III had appointed
Patriarch of Ethiopia and who demanded the Emperor's
adhesion to the See of Rome. One might analyse, also, such
documents as that prepared by the Ethiopian theologians in
reply to a questionnaire of Bishop Gwynne, in 1922, wherein
occur these passages:</p>
<p><em>
"Do you teach in your Church the faith which was formulated
Nicaea?</em></p>
<p><em>
"Yes, our Church has received and teaches the faith which was
formulated at Nicaea. In the creed or in the name of Nicaea she makes
known her faith..."</em></p>
<p>
I have preferred rather to dwell on the life of Ethiopian
Christianity, the austerity and devotion of the monastery, the
ancient ecclesiastical schools.</p>
<p>
I have endeavoured in treating of the general body of Ethiopic literature of former times to show that it included numerous historical works essential to a knowledge of Ethiopian
history; indeed it is on the basis of these Ethiopian writings, to
a far larger extent than upon information supplied by travellers
and writers of other lands, that western authors have compiled
their histories of the country.</p>
<p>
In the chapter on secular song and poetry I have again been
aided by the generosity of Mr Menghestu Lemma, as well as by
Miss Mary Tadessa, Mr Worku Haptewold and Mr H. Tims.
I would instance as a work of peculiarly poignant beauty the
dirge for her father of the daughter of Sabagadis, which was
admired and translated in the early nineteenth century by
Bishop Samuel Gobat, and is included here. A satirical household song, in the rendering of which I was assisted by
Mr Lemma, is arresting in its highly imaginative quality, as
testified by the following phrases culled from it which are
intended to express utter instability:</p>
<p class="indentb">
Breeches of wind and buttons of hail,<br>
A horse of mist and a swollen ford,<br>
A hyena bearing meat, led by a leather thong.</p>
<p>
I must emphasize that the folk-song is alive in Ethiopia; it is
not a memory of the past; it is still in active production; it is
attuned to the mood of the singer and to the circumstances of
the time, to the affairs of the household and the village; to
great events of national interest.
</p><p>
I have been able to place before the reader a series of MS.
illustrations in seven centuries; I have added in the same
chapter specimens of MS. writing from Wright's catalogue of
Magdala Collection in the British Museum for 1400-34,
1586-7 , 1664-7 and 1855-65. The characteristics of MS.
writing in various periods can thus be observed.
</p><p>
Among MS. illustrations here reproduced I have included
some examples from the Ethiopian National Library, some from
Paris Biblioth&#233;que Nationale, as well as one photograph
taken by Mr D. R. Buxton from the Church of Debra Mariam.
The chapters on the manuscripts have, however, mainly been
illustrated by photographs taken for me from the Great
Magdala Collection in the British Museum, where I was able
to have the assistance of exceptionally good photographic
facilities, and also the generous assistance of Mr R. L. Jarmain.
</p><p>
I have chosen from British Museum MS. Orient. No. 481 the
representation of <em>The Angel of the Lord appearing to Moses,</em> on account of its solemn Byzantine character and the sentiment of
awe and mystery it conveys.
</p><p>
I have reproduced many illustrations from British Museum
MSS. Orient. 510 and 533, both of which are highly characteristic
Ethiopian art. Orient. 510, measuring as it does no less
than 17 &#190; ins., by 16 ins., is a truly magnificent volume which has caused me deep regret that I am not able to offer it in facsimile
size and in the beautiful colours of the original. Despite the high
cost, I have had two of its illustrations reproduced in colour
photography, but even these, alas, do not fully convey the
impression of the original, being greatly reduced in size,
separated from the surrounding script and deprived of the
pleasing texture of the vellum. Moreover the colour reproduction is not entirely exact; the red inclines to be somewhat more
brilliant than the original and the entire appearance slightly
less harmonious. Nevertheless I consider reproduction by
photo-process infinitely preferably to copying, as the copyist
almost inevitably imports something of his or her own manner
and an exact reproduction is seldom possible.
</p>
<p><em>The Flight into Egypt</em> which I have chosen is particularly
satisfying as decoration and is eminently suitable as the illustration of a manuscript. <em>The Cleansing of the Temple,</em> both in
colour and style, is also essentially suited to an illustration
on vellum. Though it conforms to the exigencies of the level plane
desirable for its purpose it is extremely vigorous in treatment
and conveys an energy of movement befitting the subject it portrays. It is a highly accomplished work only slightly marred
by retouching.
</p><p>
British Museum MS. Orient. No. 533 containing <em>The
Revelation of St John the Divine</em> and other material is also admirable though in an entirely different style, later and in many
respects more advanced. I have reproduced from it a number
of beautiful illustrations, two of them in colour.
</p><p>
The artist of this MS. has used more solid paint than that
employed for Orient. 510; consequently some pages of 533 have
suffered a good deal from scaling and there has been some unfortunate overpainting. I believe however that the pictures
I have selected from this fine manuscript will be widely appreciated. They are pleasing in composition and have considerable
beauty of line and form. Despite the tragic character of The
Revelation of St John, a serene loveliness pervades many of
the illustrations. The youthful St John penning his work beside
sea has an almost childlike sweetness of face and form. Several
of the other pictures convey, on the other hand, a sense
of drama and tragedy. The colour prints reproduced from this
manuscript, though inevitably inferior to the original, are
nevertheless extremely rich in colour and design.
</p><p>
The latest of the manuscripts I have selected, Orient. 733
was penned by the principal scribe of the Emperor Theodore
(1885-68) and illustrated by the painter, Luke. Its reproduction has been restricted to half-tone with much regret, the
translucent water-colour painting of the floral decoration being
so charming.
</p><p>
The modern manuscripts in traditional style, kindly lent by
Mr H. D. Molesworth, illustrating the life of Saint Tekla
Haimanot, are also delightfully painted in beautiful translucent watercolour.
</p><p>
I am glad to be able to reproduce the work of some young
Ethiopian artists of to-day, two of whom have received professional instruction abroad and some who are virtually self-taught

</p><p>
having received, at most, only the usual school drawing
lessons, compressed all the world over into the crowded curriculum necessitated by preparation for general certificates of
education at the various stages. The artistic talent of these
young painters is nevertheless evident. <em>The Coffee Party</em> by
Kristos Desta is a lively conception, though the youthful artist
has not yet sufficient experience to complete his idea. Menghetsu Lemma (who later helped me with K&#233;n&#233; translations, as
already noted, and who has written poems in Ge'ez and
Amharic on his own account) also when at school displayed
painter. I have reproduced two of his youthful works.
</p><p>
The late Agegnu Engeda, who had studied in Paris, subsequently decorated the main assembly hall of the Ethiopian
Parliament with frescoes depicting important events in Ethiopian
history. The photograph of his graceful painting of a
young Ethiopian woman, included in these pages, reveals him
as a	highly capable and sensitive artist with a finely developed
sense of form and capacity to paint.
</p><p>
Balatchau Damar of Harar, whose work was brought to my
notice by Mr George Sandwith, paints rapidly in traditional style.

</p><p>
Afewerk Tekle, among the living Ethiopian artists whose
work I have reproduced in this volume, is alone in having
enjoyed a professional art training abroad. As a pupil of the
Haile Sellassie I Secondary School near Addis Ababa he already manifested artistic talent. Sent abroad by the Ministry of
Education, he spent two years at the Central School of Arts and
Crafts in London and a further two years at the Slade School of
Fine Arts (London University). Professor Coldstream wrote me that he had there "made very good use of his time". During a
summer holiday he enjoyed a visit to Spain which has greatly
influenced his subsequent painting. The monochrome "Lisbon"
reproduced in these pages is one of his many sketches made
during that vacation. On returning to Ethiopia he exhibited his
works in the Addis Ababa Municipal Hall. The Ethiopian
Government subsequently sent him for a further year of study
in Italy and France. The sketches from his Italian notebook
here reproduced reveal his vigorous drawing. The prints from
photographs of his paintings have lost more in reproduction,
enough I hope can be discerned to reveal him as a talented young artist in the course of his development.
</p><p>
Elizabeth Tesfae, who studied in Paris, is also a brilliant

rising artist. Her vivid portrait sketches of Ethiopian notables
and peasants, exhibited in the Addis Ababa Jubilee Exhibition
of 1951, had been hung far above the line; nevertheless the
Committee of European and Ethiopian judges rightly awarded
her the Gold Medal of the Exhibition.
</p><p>
I have included a list of the literary works produced in
Ethiopia in modern times. The late Blatengueta Herouy, at
one time Minister of Foreign Affairs, was the pioneer of
modern literature, under the ever constant solicitude and
encouragement of the Emperor who has been active in every
sphere of Ethiopian life and who established the Berhanena
Salem Press, at which many of the modern works have been
produced. Among contemporary Ethiopian authors may be
mentioned Bitwoded Endalkatchew Makonnen, who combines
with the duties of Prime Minister an interest in the arts, and is
himself both painter and writer. Waizeru Senedu Gabre has
written dramas in Amharic verse, of which one of the more
notable is a tragedy inspired by the national resistance, entitled <em>Graziani Days.</em> Her sister, an able musician, has composed
music to accompany this drama.
</p><p>
Many rising authors have described the enemy occupation
and the national resistance. Mahtama Sellassie Walda Maskal
has recorded his meditations in an Italian penal settlement
under the attractive title, <em>A Wondrous Marvel.</em> Takle-Berhan
Zena is the author of <em>Revealer of Light,</em> a life of Bishop Petros who suffered martyrdom for his fidelity to the national cause. Many
novels and poems have been published on the life of Ethiopians
abroad, as exiles or as students. One of the more notable of these
is by Wolde Guiorguis Wolde Yohannes who is also the author
of several poems. Many works of ancient and contemporary
history and numerous dramas based on historical incidents are
now produced each year, as well as a number of translations
such as Sirak Herouy's Amharic rendering of Dr Johnson's
Rasselas and Kebede Mikael's version of Shakespeare's <em>Romeo
and Juliet.</em>
</p><p>
It should be emphasized that until the reign of Menelik II
(1889-1913) Ethiopian education was officially maintained by
the Church; the curriculum of the schools had been little
changed since ancient times. In the year 1908 the Emperor
Menelik established two modern schools under Government
auspices: the Menelik II Lyceum in Addis Ababa and the
</p><p>
Menelik School at Harar. Professor Hana Salib Bey, an
	
Egyptian, was appointed Director of Public Education, as well
as Director the Lyceum.
</p><p>
Under the Regency of Ras Tafari, the future Emperor Haile
Sellassie I, Ethiopian education was firmly established on sound
foundations with the purpose of creating a body of trained
administrators and technicians for Government service, and a
broadly based system of modern education, for boys and also
for girls, to apply to the whole people, without distinction of
religion or racial origin, and to be extended as rapidly as
possible to all parts of the country.
</p><p>
From its inception Ethiopian State Education was entirely
free; and all school equipment were gratuitously supplied;
boarding schools provided everything, including the clothing of
pupils without charge.
</p><p>
State Education had been established by Menelik II as a
minor department of Government under a Director General;
Haile Sellassie I raised the Education Department to the status
of a Ministry of Education and Fine Arts, of equal importance
to the Ministries of the Interior, Foreign Affairs, Defence and so
forth.  During the period of his Regency he had already established a number of modern schools and had initiated the policy
of sending promising pupils abroad for higher studies: on his
accession to the Imperial Throne the development of all
branches of education was accelerated; it became the heaviest
charge on the national budget and the primary object of
Government solicitude.
</p><p>
In the period prior to the Italian invasion modern schools
had already been opened in the capital and also in a number of
the provinces,	primary and secondary education had been
	
initiated and professional training had commenced at the
Haile Sellassie I Academy of Arts and Sciences; school libraries
and labratories for scientific instruction were already in being.
The Empress Menen's Girls' High School had been created in
1931; at the close of each school year some of its pupils, and also
	some of the boys from the Tafari Makonnen School attended the examination held at the French Legation for the French certificate of proficiency in Primary Studies, thereby aligning
themselves with the educational attainments of European
youth.	This was at that period a considerable innovation for
Africa and the Middle East, particularly in the education of girls.
</p>

<p>In the chapters devoted to modern education I have
included a brief history of the Tafari Makonnen School issued by
the school itself. This school, founded by the present Emperor
during his Regency, has the distinction of having educated
substantial proportion of the Ethiopians who were subsequently sent abroad for further studies and are to-day giving
efficient service to their country in the Ethiopian Government.</p>

<p>The first period of Ethiopian modern education was brought
abruptly to a close by the Italian invasion. I have attempted in
a few pages to bring before the reader the immense miseries
suffered by the Ethiopian people during the enemy occupation
drawing upon the account of the Hungarian physician
Dr Saska, a witness of the terrible Addis Ababa Massacre of
1937, the full text of which, under his pseudonym <em>Boris Sava,</em> is
only available in <em>New Times and Ethiopia News.</em> I have been
guided also by the accounts of other eye-witnesses which reached
me during the five tragic years of the interregnum and by
photographs taken by the Italians to record their own atrocities
which I obtained in Ethiopia in 1944 and also received from
British soldiers who had taken them from the pockets of 
Italian prisoners. The telegrams embodying the orders of
Mussolini, Graziani and their subordinates, facsimiles of which
were submitted to the Paris Peace Conference of 1946, confirm
the other evidence.</p>

<p>The tragic five years interregnum, during which all Ethiopians
schools were closed and education in the real sense of the tern
was non-existent, made a painful breach in the progress which
had been accomplished by the hard work of the Emperor and
his Government.</p>

<p>The second period of modern education began with the
resumption of Ethiopian administration in February, 1942.  In
dealing with the great advance achieved in the post-liberation
period, I have devoted a chapter to the first difficult seven
years, when revenue had to be built up from zero by a robbed
and ruined people, with the meagre, though welcome assistance of a British Grant-in-aid, totalling a mere &#163;3,000,000
spread over two and a half years. The task of the teacher was at
that time complicated by the fact that along with little children
entering school at the normal age were older boys and girls
craving for the instruction which had been denied to them during the sad five years interregnum. Nevertheless despite the

penury and confusion left by the war in Ethiopia and the
World War then raging, which imposed grave shortages in the
field of pedagogy as in every other peaceable activity, I have
been able to chronicle much accomplishment in those years and
the laying of sure foundations for future educational progress.
I was indeed astonished on my visit to Ethiopia in the autumn
and winter of 1944 to find the schools so relatively flourishing
and well-equipped and to witness the rapid advance the pupils
had already made, as testified by the work I saw them doing in
class, and the exercise books I was able to examine at leisure by
the kindness of Ato Emmanuel Abraham, Director General of
Education at that period. The enthusiasm and zest of the Ethiopian pupil was and is impressive.</p>
<p>
Further chapters comprise descriptions of some of the schools
more recently visited and statistics of subsequent progress, the
curriculum of the University College of Addis Ababa, some
facts about the projected Haile Sellassie I University.</p>
<p>
Ethiopia is in process of creating a national education suited
to her own needs, culling what seems to her best in the education systems of other countries, while preserving the qualities
own culture.</p>
<p>
In introducing these pages to the reader I must add the
reminder that Ethiopia has her own ancient script which is
totally different from Roman characters, Arabic, Hebrew or any
other. Transliteration from this totally different script into the
Roman characters current in Britain and Europe has not been
systematic. The writing of Ethiopian names in Roman script
is done by ear; each English, French, Italian, German or other
writer arranges the spelling which seems to him to express the
sound of the Ethiopian name according to the usage of his own
country; each of these considers the sound of the same name
should be spelt in a different way.</p>
<p>
The scholars who claim to write Ethiopian names according
to a scientific system of phonetics use diacritic signs which are
not understood by the average reader; moreover, alas, these
scholars often produce results which appear utterly grotesque
to the ordinary man or woman who is familiar with Ethiopian
people and has heard them pronounce various well-known
Ethiopian names. One such learned author writes <em>Hayla
Selassie</em> instead of the usual <em>Haile Sellassie</em> which is familiar all
over Europe and America; another writes <em>Ras Makuannen,</em>


instead of the more usual Ras Makonnen. In Budge's history
Ethiopia I find the same King referred to as Sus&#233;nius, Susenyos,
Susinyos, Susneos and Susneus. In fact consultation of authorities
who have written on Ethiopian questions results in in much mystification and confusion in the matter of spelling.</p>
<p>
I do not claim to have been able to follow a uniform system
in the present work; in the main I have adopted the spelling of
the sources I have quoted.</p>

<p>In concluding this preface I would express my profound
gratitude to Their Imperial Majesties The Emperor Haile
Sellassie and the Empress Menen for the generous hospitality
they graciously accorded to me in their country, with every
facility I needed for my researches; I had freedom to visit
everything and generous help in doing so. I would thank
their daughter H.I.H. Princess Tenagne Work Haile Sellassie
and her husband His Excellency Bitwoded Andargatchau
Massai for their kind help and hospitality during my visit
Gondar as well as in Addis Ababa. I would add an expression
of my gratitude to all the other members of the Imperial
Family for innumerable kindnesses.</p>

<p>My warm thanks are due to H.E. Ato Tafara Worq, then
Private Secretary to His Imperial Majesty, who most kindly

assistance in supplying me with documents and photographs.</p>

<p>I would thank indeed all the Ministers and members of the
Ethiopian Government for many helpful courtesies, and the
Governors of the many Provinces I visited who were lavish
their help and hospitality. In Addis Ababa itself and in every
province I enjoyed the most generous co-operation fro
Ecclesiastics, Government officials and advisers, from teachers,

Ethiopian and of many other nationalities. I had always a
friendly welcome from the school children and students who
one and all replied to the questions their teacheiers invitted me to
ask with unaffected frankness and bright intellitligence.
</p>
<p>Among the many others who helped me in Ethiopia I would
mention with gratitude His Grace Bishop Theophillos, their

</p>
<p>Dr Richard K. P. Pankhurst has assisted me over many a
stile the compilation of this work and its index, particularly



in some of the historical chapters and in those referring to the
modern schools, many of which he visited with me.
</p><p>
Wherever I went in Ethiopia I felt I was among friends, I
derived from my visits there more happiness than I can ever
adequately express. All my memories of the beautiful country,
its magnificent mountains and everchanging skies, its glorious
sunshine and climate of perpetual spring, its wealth of foliage
and flowers, its erect and handsome people, graceful in their
white national dress, are endeared to me by recollections of the
constant kindness I was privileged to receive in that entrancing
wonderland.
