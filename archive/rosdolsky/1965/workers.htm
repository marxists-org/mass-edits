  <h3>The Workers and the Fatherland</h3>

  <h4>I</h4>

  <p class="fst">The passage in question discusses the
attitude of the workers <i>to their country</i>. It reads:</p>

  <p class="fst quoteb">The Communists are further
reproached with desiring to abolish
countries and nationality.</p>

  <p class="quoteb">The working men have no country. We
cannot take from them what they
have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political
supremacy, must constitute itself the nation, it is, so far, itself
national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word. National
differences and antagonisms between peoples are vanishing gradually
from day to day, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to
freedom of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of
production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto. The
supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster.
United action, of the leading civilised countries at least, is one of
the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.</p>

  <p class="fst quoteb">In proportion as the exploitation
of one individual by another is put
an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put
an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the
nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an
end.<a href="#01">[1]</a></p>

  <p class="fst">And on a preceding page, the <i>Manifesto</i> says:</p>

  <p class="quoteb">Though not in substance, yet in form, the
struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat
of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its
own bourgeoisie.<a href="#02">[2]</a></p>

  <p class="fst">These passages have been cited innumerable times in socialist
literature, usually in order to justify the negative attitude of the
socialist labour movement towards bourgeois patriotism and chauvinism.
Often, however, the attempt has been made to temper the stern language
of these passages and to give them a contrary, nationalist meaning.</p>

  <p class="fst">As an example we may cite H. Cunow, the well-known German Social
Democratic theoretician. He discusses the above passages in his book on
<i>Marx's Theories of History, Society and State</i>. According to Cunow, all
that Marx and Engels wanted to say was:</p>

  <p class="fst quoteb">Today (1848) the worker has no country, he does not take part in the
life of the nation, has no share in its material and spiritual wealth.
But one of these days the workers will win political power and take a
dominant position in state and nation and then, when so to speak
[?] they <i>will have constituted themselves the nation</i>, they will
also be national and feel national, even though their nationalism [!]
will be of a different kind than that of the bourgeoisie.<a href="#03">[3]</a></p>

  <p class="fst">This interpretation by Cunow<a href="#04">[4]</a> stumbles
over a little phrase, the phrase 'so far' ('Since the proletariat.... must constitute itself the nation,
it is, <i>so far</i>, itself national'), which indicates that Marx and Engels
did not expect the proletariat to remain 'national' for ever...</p>

  <p class="fst">Cunow's interpretation became the standard one in the reformist
literature; but after World War II, it found acceptance in the
Communist camp as well. Thus, we read in the 'Introduction' of the
edition of the <i>Manifesto</i> published by the Stern-Verlag in Vienna in 1946:</p>

  <p class="fst quoteb">When Marx says in the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>:
'Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading
class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is, so far,
itself national', we must understand that it is precisely in our time
that the working class acts as a national class, as the backbone of the
nation in the struggle against fascism and for democracy. The working
class of Austria is fighting today to win its Austrian fatherland by
creating an independent, free and democratic Austria.<a href="#05">[5]</a></p>

  <p class="fst">This evidently is not only equivalent to Cunow's interpretation, but
even goes beyond it.</p>

  <p class="fst">In complete contrast to these nationalistic interpretations is what
<i>Lenin</i> wrote in his famous essay 'Karl Marx':</p>

  <p class="fst quoteb">The nation is a necessary product, and inevitable form, in the
bourgeois epoch of social development. The working class cannot grow strong, cannot
mature, cannot consolidate its forces, except by 'constituting itself the nation',
without being 'national' ('though not in the bourgeois sense of the
word'). But the development of capitalism tends to break down national
boundaries, does away with national isolation, substitutes class
antagonisms for national antagonisms. In the more developed capitalist
countries it is perfectly true that 'the workers have no fatherland'
and that 'united action' of the workers, in the civilised countries at
least, 'is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the
proletariat.<a href="#06">[6]</a></p>

  <p class="fst">Yet even Lenin's interpretation is not satisfactory either.
While, according to the <i>Manifesto</i>, the proletariat, even after
winning political supremacy, will be 'so far, itself national', Lenin 
restricts this 'being national' <i>only to the beginnings of the
working  class movement</i>, before the working class 'comes of
age'. In a <i>fully developed</i> capitalist society, says Lenin, the
workers more than ever will have <i>no fatherland</i>!...</p>

  <p class="fst">That much about various interpretations of the quoted passages of
the <i>Manifesto</i>. It may not appear strange that a number of
socialist authors attempted to find their real meaning. It is
much stranger that, in the course of time, these passages
became a sort of credo, that far reaching programmatic slogans were
derived from them, even if the words of the <i>Manifesto</i> were
not fully understood... This applies in particular to
the statement that the workers have 'no country'. It was much
easier to repeat it constantly than to <i>explain</i> this apparently
simple sentence and bring it into agreement with the everyday
<i>practice</i> of the Socialist (and later the Communist) parties. And,
unfortunately, this practice seemed more and more to give the 
lie to the authors of the <i>Manifesto</i>....</p>

  <h4>II</h4>

  <p class="fst">What then is the actual meaning of the
statements of the <i>Manifesto</i>? In what sense do the workers have 'no
country', and how is it that, nonetheless, even after acquiring supremacy, they will
still remain 'so far, national'? To answer this question, it
would seem, we must first examine the terminology of the <i>Manifesto</i>.</p>

  <p class="fst">It is well known that the terms of 'nation' and 'nationality' are
not always and everywhere used in the same sense. In English and
in French, for example, a 'nation' is usually taken to mean the
population of a <i>sovereign state</i>, and the word 'nationality' is taken to
be <i>either</i> a synonym of citizenship <i>or</i> to designate a mere <i>community of
descent and language</i> (a 'people' - German 'Volk') - whereas in Germany
and in Eastern Europe <i>both</i> terms refer primarily to communities of
descent and language.<a href="#07">[7]</a></p>

  <p class="fst">Marx and Engels, especially in their early writings, almost always
followed the English and French usage. They used the word 'nation'
primarily to designate the population of a sovereign state (by way of
exception, they also applied this term to 'historical' peoples, such as
the Poles, who had been - temporarily - deprived of a state of their own).
'Nationality', on the other hand, meant to them: (1) either belonging
to a state, that is, a people having a state;<a href="#08">[8]</a> or (2) a mere ethnic
community. Accordingly, this is almost the only term they used in
relation to the so-called 'peoples without history', such as the
Austrian Slavs (Czechs, Croats, etc.) and Romanians, or to 'remnants of
peoples', such as Gaels, Bretons and Basques. And just this concept of
'nationality' - in sharp contrast to that of 'nation' (by which they
understood a people which had a state of its own and therefore its own
political history) - was most characteristic of the terminology of Marx
and Engels! We cite some examples:</p>

  <p class="quoteb">The Highland Gaels and the Welsh [said Engels in the journal <i>The
Commonwealth</i> in 1866] are undoubtedly of different <i>nationalities</i> to
what the English are, although nobody will give to these remnants of
peoples long gone by the title of <i>nations</i>, any more than to the
Celtic inhabitants of Brittany in France....<a href="#09">[9]</a></p>

  <p class="fst">And in the article 'Germany and Panslavism' (1855) he says of the Austrian Slavs:</p>

  <p class="fst quoteb">We can distinguish two groups of Austrian Slavs. One group consists of
remnants of <i>nationalities</i>, whose own history belongs to the past and
whose present historical development is tied up with that of <i>nations</i> of
different race and speech.... Consequently, these <i>nationalities</i>,
although living exclusively on Austrian soil, are in no way constituted
as different <i>nations</i>.<a href="#10">[10]</a></p>

  <p class="fst">In another place Engels says:</p>

  <p class="fst quoteb">Neither Bohemia nor Croatia possessed the power to exist as <i>nations</i> by
themselves. Their <i>nationalities</i>, gradually undermined by
historical factors which cause their absorption by more vigorous
races, can expect to win back some sort of independence only if they
link themselves with other Slavic nations (Engels refers here to
Russia).<a href="#11">[11]</a></p>

  <p class="fst">How much importance Engels attached to the
terminological differentiation of the concepts of 'nation' and 'nationality' can be
seen from the article cited from <i>The Commonwealth</i>, in which he makes a
sharp distinction <i>between the 'national' and the 'nationality'
questions, between the 'national' and the 'nationality' principles</i>.</p>

  <p class="fst">He approved only the first principle, vigorously <i>rejecting</i> the second.
(As is well known, Marx and Engels mistakenly denied a political future
to the 'peoples without history' - Czechs, Slovaks, Serbs, Croats,
Slovenes, Ukrainians, Romanians, etc.<a href="#12">[12]</a>)</p>

  <h4>III</h4>

  <p class="fst">The <i>Communist Manifesto</i> too provides a number of instances of this use
of terminology. When it speaks, for example, of the 'national
industries' being undermined by the development of capitalism<a href="#13">[13]</a>, it
evidently refers to industries confined to the territory of a given
state. The 'Nationalfabriken' (in the English version, 'factories owned
by the State') referred to at the end of the second section are, of
course, to be understood in the same sense. And in the sentence:
'Independent, or but loosely connected provinces, with separate
interests, laws, governments and systems of taxation, became lumped
together into one <i>nation</i>, with one government, one code of laws, one
<i>national</i> class interest, one frontier and one customs tariff'<a href="#14">[14]</a>, the
words 'nation' and 'national' refer evidently to the state, the people
having a state, and not to the nationality in the sense of descent and
language. Finally, when in the <i>Manifesto</i> Marx and Engels speak of a
<i>'national' struggle of the proletariat</i>, this means something 
quite different from the reformist and neo-reformist interpretations. This is clear from the
following passage, which portrays the origin of the proletarian class struggle:</p>

  <p class="fst quoteb">At first the contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by the
work-people of a factory, then by the operatives of one trade, in one
locality, against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits
them.... It was just this contact that was needed to centralise the
numerous local struggles, all of the same character, into one <i>national</i>
struggle between classes.<a href="#15">[15]</a></p>

  <p class="fst">Here the 'national' struggle of the proletariat, i.e. the struggle
waged on the scale of the entire state, is equated directly with the
class struggle, since only such a centralisation of the
struggles of the workers on the scale of the state could oppose the workers as a
<i>class</i> to the <i>class</i> of the bourgeoisie and give these struggles the
stamp of <i>political</i> struggles.<a href="#16">[16]</a> To return to the passage cited at the
outset, when Marx and Engels speak of the struggle of the proletariat
against the bourgeoisie as one that is '<i>at first national</i>', they
evidently have in mind a struggle waged at first within the framework
<i>of a single state</i>, as is clear from the reason given, that 'the
proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle
matters with its own bourgeoisie'. But from this point of view the
statement of the rise of the proletariat '<i>to be the leading class of
the nation</i>', its constituting itself '<i>the nation</i>', likewise takes on a
very definite meaning. It says that the proletariat must at first be
guided by existing state borders, must rise to be the leading class
<i>within the existing states</i>! That is <i>why</i> it will at first be '<i>so far,
national</i>' - 'though not in the bourgeois sense of the word' - for the
bourgeoisie sees its goal as political detachment of the peoples from
each other and exploitation of foreign nations by its own. On the other
hand, the victorious working class will from the beginning work towards
the elimination of national hostilities and antagonisms of peoples. By
its hegemony it will create conditions under which 'the antagonism
between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation
to another will come to an end'. From this, and only from this
standpoint, it is possible to understand what the young Engels meant
when he wrote of the 'abolition' or 'annihilation' of nationality:
certainly not the 'abolition' of the existing ethnic and linguistic
communities (this would have been absurd!), but of the <i>political</i>
delimitations of peoples.<a href="#17">[17]</a> In a society in which (in the words of the
<i>Manifesto</i>) 'the public power will lose it political character' and <i>the
state as such will wither away</i> there can be no room for separate 'national states'!...</p>

  <h4>IV</h4>

  <p class="fst">We feel that our analysis of the terminology of the <i>Manifesto</i> is more
than a mere philological 'hair-splitting'. It has shown that the
passages in question relate primarily to 'nation' and 'nationality' in
the <i>political</i> sense and are therefore inconsistent with earlier
interpretations. This applies especially to the thoroughly arbitrary
and sophistical explanation by Cunow, who tried to derive a specific
'proletarian nationalism' from the <i>Manifesto</i> and reduced the
internationalism of the working class movement to the desire for
international co-operation among peoples.<a href="#18">[18]</a> But neither did the
<i>Manifesto</i> preach that the proletariat should be indifferent with
respect to national movements, should display a sort of 'nihilism' in
question's of nationality! When the <i>Manifesto</i> says that the workers
'have no country', this refers to the bourgeois national <i>state</i>, not to
nationality in the ethnical sense. The workers 'have no country'
because according to Marx and Engels, they must regard the bourgeois
national state as a machinery for their oppression<a href="#19">[19]</a> - and
after they have achieved power they will likewise have 'no country' in the
political sense, inasmuch as the separate socialist national states
<i>will be only a transitional stage on the way to the classless and
stateless society of the future</i>, since the construction of such a
society <i>is possible only on the international scale</i>! Thus, the
'indifferentist' interpretation of the <i>Manifesto</i> that was customary in
'orthodox' Marxist circles has no justification. The fact that by and
large this interpretation did little harm to the socialist movement,
and in some sense even furthered it, is due to the circumstance
that - although in a distorted way - it reflected the <i>inherent
cosmopolitan tendency of the workers movement</i>,<a href="#20">[20]</a> its effort 
to overcome national narrow-mindedness and the 'national separations and
antagonisms between peoples'. In this sense, however, it was much
<i>closer</i> to the spirit of Marxism and of the <i>Manifesto</i> than the
nationalistic interpretation of Bernstein, Cunow and others.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="04">4</a> Cunow was not the first to interpret the Manifesto in this
sense. Like many other reformist innovations, this too originates with
the founder of revisionism, E. Bernstein. He says, in an article on 'The German
Social Democracy and the Turkish Tangle' (<em>Neue Zeit</em>,
1896-7, no. 4, pp. 111ff): 'The statement
that the proletarian has no country is amended where, when and to the extent
that he can participate as a full citizen in the government and legislation of his
country, and is able to change its institutions according to his wishes.'</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="05">5</a> The idea that the Austrian workers might have wanted to
fight for socialism in their country apparently did not even occur to
the writer of the 'Introduction'...</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="06">6</a> V.I. Lenin, <em>The Teachings of Karl
Marx</em> (International Publishers, 1930), p.31.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="07">7</a> K. Kautsky says on this subject:
'The concept of the nation is likewise hard to delimit. The difficulty is not decreased by
the fact that two different social formations are denoted by the same word, and
the same formation by two different words. In Western Europe, with its old capitalist
culture, the people of each state feel closely tied to it. There, the
population of a state is designated as the nation. In this sense, for
example, we speak of a Belgian nation. The further east we go in Europe, the
more numerous are the portions of the population in a state that do not wish
to belong to it, that constitute national communities of their own within it. They
too are called 'nations' or 'nationalities'. It would be advisable to use only
the latter term for them.' (<em>Die materialistische Geschichtsauffassung</em>,
vol. 2, p.441.)</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="08">8</a> Compare Marx's speech on Poland dated 22 February 1848:
'The three powers [viz. Prussia, Austria and Russia] marched along with
history. In 1846, when incorporating Cracow into Austria, they
confiscated the last ruins of the Polish nationality...' (<em>MEGA</em>, vol. 6,
p. 408; see also <em>Gesammelte Schriften</em>, vol. 1, p.247). Here too, as in many other
passages in Marx and Engels, 'nationality' refers to nothing but government.</p>

in the Revolution of 1848</em> (n. pub.: Critique Books, 1986).]</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="13">13</a> <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>, p.12.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="14">14</a> Ibid., p.13.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="15">15</a> Ibid., pp. 17-18.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="16">16</a> Compare Die deutsche Ideologie:
'Precisely because the bourgeoisie is no longer an estate, but a class, it is compelled to
organise itself nationally, no longer locally, and to give its average interests a
general form' (<em>MEGA</em>, vol. 5, p.52).</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="17">17</a> Along these lines, Engels wrote in 1846: 'Only the
proletarians can abolish nationality; only the awakening proletariat
can allow various nations to fraternise' (<em>MEGA</em>, vol. 6, p.460).
Similarly, in the <em>German Ideology</em>, the proletariat is referred to as a class that is 'already the
expression of the dissolution of all classes, nationalities, etc. within present-day society....
in which nationality is already abolished' (Ibid., vol. 5, pp.60 and 50; and cf. ibid., vol. 5, p.454).</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="18">18</a> The high point of Cunow's misreading of the <em>Manifesto</em> is
perhaps the following passage in his book: 'And it is just as unreasonable to
conclude from the call &quot;Workers of all countries unite!&quot; ... that Marx
intended to say that the worker is outside the national community. No
more than the call, &quot;Journalists, physicians, philologists, etc., get together in
international unions to carry out your tasks!&quot; means that the members
of these professional associations should not feel linked to their
nationality....' (Op. cit., vol. 2, p.29). Cf. Marx's <em>Critique
of the Gotha Programme</em>, 1875, whose point 5 reads:</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal quoteb">The working class strives for its emancipation first of all
within the framework of the present-day national state, conscious that the necessary
result of its efforts, which are common to the workers of all civilised
countries, will be the International brotherhood of peoples.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">On this Marx said:</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal quoteb">Lassalle, in opposition to the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> and to
all earlier socialism, conceived the workers' movement from the narrowest national
standpoint. He is being followed in this-and that after the work of the
International! It is altogether self-evident that, to be able to fight at all,
the working class must organise itself at home as a <i>class</i> and that its
own country is the immediate arena of its struggle. In so far its class struggle is
national, not in substance, but, as the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> says, 'in form'.
But the 'framework of the present-day national state', for instance, the German
Empire, is itself in its turn economically 'within the framework' of the world
market, politically 'within the framework' of the system of states. Every
businessman knows that German trade is at the same time foreign trade, and the
greatness of Herr Bismarck consists, to be sure, precisely in his pursuing a
kind of <i>international</i> policy. And to what does the German workers' party reduce
its internationalism? To the consciousness that the result of its efforts will
be 'international brotherhood of peoples'-a phrase borrowed from the bourgeois
League of Peace, which is intended to pass as equivalent to the international
brotherhood of the working classes in the joint struggle against the ruling
classes and their governments. Not a word, therefore, about the international
functions of the German working class!' (<em>Selected Works</em>, vol. 2, p.25f).</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="19">19</a> In one of his notebooks Marx
excerpted the following from Brissot de Warville:</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal quoteb">There is one insight that only those suspect who draw up
plans of education for the people - that there can be no virtue since three-quarters
of the people have no property; for without property the people <i>have no
country</i>, without a country everything is against them, and for their part they
must be armed against all ... Since this is the luxury of three-quarters of
bourgeois society, it follows that these three-quarters can have neither
religion nor morality nor attachment to the Government ... (<em>MEGA</em>,
vol. 6, p. 617).</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="20">20</a> In his letter to Sorge of 12-17 September 1874, Engels
wrote of the 'common <i>cosmopolitan</i> interests of the proletariat'. This is an interesting
contrast to the derogatory connotation which the word 'cosmopolitanism'
has assumed in the political vocabulary of the Soviet Union.</p>
