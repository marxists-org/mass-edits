<p class="fst">Dear Friends:</p>

<p class="fst">Thank you for the forwarded material. Among other things I received there was also a Minority leaflet from which I learned that Comrade Shachtman continues to call himself: &#8220;Editor of Trotsky&#8217;s Works.&#8221; As indeed he used to be, but that was when he still belonged to our organization. However, now that Comrade Shachtman has split from us; today when the organ of the Minority polemicizes against us covertly or openly; when individual comrades of the Minority, carried away by factional feelings and corresponding views, permit themselves to voice, without any justification whatsoever, their disregard for the personality of L.D. I consider it necessary to state that Comrade Shachtman cannot any longer come forward as Editor of Trotsky&#8217;s Works. This, side by side with another of his &#8220;callings,&#8221; that of National Secretary of the &#8220;Workers&#8217; Party,&#8221; is not only illogical but demagogic.</p>
