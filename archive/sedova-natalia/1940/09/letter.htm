<p class="fst"><B>MEXICO CITY, Sept. 13 &ndash; A letter sent by Natalia Trotsky yesterday, thanking President Cardenas for a personal visit he and Mrs. Cardenas had made, was released today by the Presidential Palace and published in the press.</B></p>

<p>The text of the letter follows:</p>

<p class="fst">Mr. President: Permit me to offer to your wife and yourself my most profound appreciation for your visit, for your sincere sentiments, for your unalterable conviction in the honor of Leon Trotsky and for the contempt manifested by you toward calumny and lie. Calumny and lie are not weapons sufficient to assure a definitive victory to those who are using them. My meeting with you on August 24th constitutes for me a moral support for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>There has never been in history an epoch as overshadowed by lie, calumny, crime and inhumanity, as that today. Honorable fighters fall as victims. Their memory, nevertheless, will be eternal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my husband could not know you personally. Our life, despite that, was linked with yours by the bonds of your generous disposition and by your aid in our days of difficulty, which were so frequent. In Norway, we found ourselves imminently menaced with death, and not a single country in the world ventured to aid the disinherited. The exception came from legendary Mexico, with its generous people, expansive and independent. You prolonged the life of Leon Trotsky for 43 months. I carry in my heart my gratitude for those 43 months. Not only I, but hundreds of thousands of incorruptible fighters, who struggle for the emancipation of humanity.</p>

<p>Your tender attention sustained us in the sorrowful moments of the loss of our son in February, 1938. And again you came to help us after the perfidious attack of our enemies against our house on May 24. Saturday (August 24) once more you proved your activity in favor of him who had from you the possibility of living on Mexican soil. Permit me, Mr. President, to repeat here the expression of my deepest gratitude to the people of Mexico, to its government and to you particularly.</p>
