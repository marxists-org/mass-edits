<p class="fst"><em>Bela Kun</em> speaks to the following effect: The task of the participators in the congress is not only to deliver speeches, but to make history. Erroneous theories have been derived from Russian experiences. The communists of the west must learn the actuality of revolutionary policy from the experiences of the Russian revolution. The reason why the Hungarian Soviet power was unable to maintain itself lay not only in the circumstance that the small country offered no line of retreat. but in the lack of leadership through an organized communist party. That was the chief deficiency of the Hungarian Soviet republic. The Russian Communist Party is the creation of decades of revolutionary struggle. It has adhered strictly to its class character, and has become a real party of the whole working people. At G&ouml;rlitz the German Social Democratic Party maintained that it was the people&rsquo;s party, but in reality it is the party of the petty bourgeoisie, and thus simultaneously the servant of the greater bourgeoisie. The Russian communists are the representatives of the Russian working people. The first conditions rendering this possible were first, the carrying out of a revolutionary policy, and secondly the mobility of the party organizations. All opportunists were removed from the party before the revolution; the Mensheviki in contact with the workers went over to the Bolsheviki during the revolution. Only the intellectuals remained with the Mensheviki. Faith in the leaders is the first premise for discipline. Moscow is no school for Prussian corporals But those who cannot keep discipline are bad recruits for Communism. The subjective premise for the world revolution depends on the creation of revolutionary groups of real workers&rsquo; leaders. These groups will form the vanguard of the communist army.</p>
