<h2>Jan Appel</h2>
<h1>Memories</h1>
<h3>1966</h3>
<hr>

<p class="information">Excerpts from an intriguing account by Jan Appel of his experiences during the 
German Revolution, as a delegate of the KAPD to the Third International and 
afterwards. Jan Appel provides an important link between the proletarian 
revolutions of 1917-1919 and the modern day.</p>

<p class="information">Marked-up by <a href="../../../admin/volunteers/steering.htm">Jonas Holmgren</a> for
the Marxists Internet Archive.</p>

<hr>

<p class="fst">My name is Jan Appel, and I was born in a village in Mecklenburg 
in 1890. I attended elementary school and learned the shipbuilding trade. Even 
before my birth my father had been a Socialist. I myself became a member of the 
Sozial-demokratische Partei Deutschlands <span class="inote">[SPD]</span> on reaching 18 years of age. I 
saw military service from 1911 to 1913, and thereafter as a soldier in the War. 
In October 1917 I was demobilised and sent to work in Hamburg as a shipyard 
worker. In 1918 we called a strike of armaments workers. The strike held out for 
a whole week at the Vulkan-Werft. Our slogan was: "For Peace!". After one week 
the strike came to an end, and we had the War Clauses read out,<a href="#n0">[1]</a> for, 
according to the law, we were still under military service. At this time I 
belonged with the Left Radicals in Hamburg. When in November 1918 the sailors 
rebelled and the Kiel shipyard workers, we heard on the Monday from workers in 
Kiel what had occurred.</p>

<p class="fst">Thereupon a clandestine meeting was held in the shipyard, which 
was under military occupation. All work ceased, but the workers remained in 
position in the shipyard. A delegation of 17 volunteers was sent to the Trade 
Union headquarters, in order to demand the calling of a General Strike. We 
forced them to hold a meeting. The result however was that well known leaders of 
the Allgemeine Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund <span class="inote">[ADGB]</span> and the SPD adopted a negative 
attitude towards the strike. There were sharp exchanges lasting many hours. 
Meanwhile a spontaneous revolt had broken out during the lunch break at the 
Blohm und Voss Shipyards, where 17,000 workers were employed. The workers left 
the factories and the Vulkan shipyards and appeared in front of the Trades Union 
Building. The leaders had vanished.</p>

<p class="fst">The revolution had begun.</p>

<p class="fst">In those days I had taken up a position in the forefront of the 
Left Revolutionary workers movement in Germany.<a href="#n0">[2]</a> As a speaker in the factories 
and at public meetings, as the Chairman of the Revolutionäre Obleute, 
<span class="inote">[Revolutionary Shop Stewards]</span>, then only newly formed, and as a member of the 
Linksradikale Gruppe <span class="inote">[Left Radical group]</span>, I now turned towards the 
Spartakusbunde <span class="inote">[Spartacist League]</span> and later began to play a leading role in the 
Hamburg District Organisation of the Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands <span class="inote">[KPD]</span>.</p>

<p class="fst">In January 1919 a large meeting of the Revolutionäre Obleute took 
place in the Trades Union Headquarters Building. This meeting was held after 
Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht had been murdered in Berlin. It was at this 
meeting that I made the acquaintance of Ernst Thälmann of the Unabhängige 
Sozial-demokratische Partei <span class="inote">[USPD]</span> or the Independent Social Democrats, and 
during the following night a march was held together with the USPD comrades to 
the barracks at Barenfeld. The guard and the sleeping soldiers were taken by 
surprise, and the arming of the workers was set in hand. We had 4000 weapons. 
After a good week of effort to build up a well-armed fighting force, those with 
arms began to disperse one after the other and disappeared along with their 
weapons. It was at this point that we arrived at the conclusion that the unions 
were quite useless for the purposes of the revolutionary struggle, and at a 
conference of the Revolutionäre Obleute, the formation of revolutionary factory 
organisations as the basis for Workers' Councils was decided upon. Moving 
outwards from Hamburg, propaganda advocating the formation of Factory 
Organisations <span class="inote">[Betriebs-organisationen]</span> was disseminated, and led to the 
founding of the Allgemeine Arbeiterunion Deutschlands or AAUD <span class="inote">[the General 
Workers Union of Germany]</span>.<a href="#r1" name="rn1" target="_self">[1*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the course of this development and the accompanying 
clarification, in which process my main function was as Chairman of the 
Revolutionäre Obleute, I assumed, partially for organisational reasons, the 
additional function of Chairman of the Hamburg District of the KPD.<a href="#n0">[3]</a> It was in 
this way that I became a delegate to the Heidelberg <span class="inote">[Second]</span> Congress of the 
KPD.<a href="#n0">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">[......]</p>

<p class="fst">Now it is 1966, some 47 years after the Heidelberg Congress. 
There is little point today in examining more closely the discussions and 
conclusions reached at this Congress. Suffice it to say that at the time it 
became clear to us that the line and policy of the KPD was designed to turn the 
main direction and aim of the Party towards participation in the bourgeois 
Parliament. Since it remained our wish to keep faith with the previously held 
convictions concerning the policy we were to pursue in relation to the 
revolutionary workers' movement in Germany, it now became impossible to continue 
as an organised tendency within the KPD. Shortly after this the Hamburg District 
of the KPD also came to this decision.</p>

<p class="fst">When, in Berlin in April 1920, the group of those in the KPD who 
held to the same view as the comrades in Hamburg, took steps to form the 
Communist Workers Party of Germany <span class="inote">[KAPD]</span>, my participation in the KPD came to 
an end. Those were the days of the Kapp-Lüttwitz putsch, and I took myself off 
to the Ruhr. Upon my return to Hamburg, I was informed that, at the Founding 
Congress of the KAPD, a delegation comprised of Franz Jung and myself had been 
elected in our absence to make the journey to Russia in order to represent the 
KAPD at the Executive Committee of the Communist International <span class="inote">[ECCI]</span>, then in 
session there. It was our task to give a report on the founding of the KAPD, to 
present its views and policy and to deliver the appropriate charges concerning 
the traitorous stance adopted by the Zentrale <span class="inote">[Central Committee]</span> of the KPD 
towards the struggle in the Ruhr.<a href="#n0">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was impossible for us to make our way overland, and passage 
through the Baltic Sea was also closed. The sole available route open to us 
seemed to me to lie through the North Sea and the Atlantic, passing Norway and 
Cape North and so into the Arctic Ocean, to reach Archangelsk and possibly 
Murmansk. We were, however uncertain as to whether or not this area had been 
retaken by the Russians, that is if the Bolsheviks had reoccupied it. A short 
time previous to this a small news item had appeared in the press to the effect 
that the American fleet, together with its complement of troops which up till 
then had occupied the area, had now been withdrawn. In spite of this 
uncertainty, we decided to risk the journey. A comrade of my acquaintance, 
Herman Knörfen, was a sailor on board the steamship Senator Schröder. This ship 
made a regular four-weekly cruise to the fishing grounds around Iceland and, 
upon its return, stayed for at least a week in Cuxhafen. I made a search for 
Herman Knörfen. Just at that time he happened to be in Hamburg, and the ship was 
in dock at Cuxhafen and due to start its outward voyage in three days time. 
Knörfen was willing, and the majority of the crew likewise - indeed, it was not 
for nothing that we were living in revolutionary times!</p>

<p class="fst">Franz Jung and I, with a further revolutionary sailor, embarked 
as stowaways. As we passed the northern tip of Heligoland, we arrested the 
captain and his officers at gunpoint and locked them up in the for'ard cabin. 
The journey began on the 20th April and ended on 1st May at Alexandrovsk, the 
seaport of Murmansk. We possessed sea charts only for the area up to Trondheim 
in Norway, and beyond that all we had to guide us was a small map in a sailing 
handbook, which offered a view of the globe looking down with the North Pole at 
its centre. The coasts of Norway, Russia, Siberia and Alaska were to be seen on 
the edges of this map. This was the sole means of navigation by which our new 
Master, Kapitän Herman Knörfen had to steer his course! At the northern tip of 
Tromsø <span class="inote">[Hammerfest]</span>, we suffered two days of unrelenting storm followed by thick 
snow, so that any sight of the distant coast was obliterated. We were all 
extremely tired, since the uncertain situation made a continuous and wary watch 
imperative. In this way, dog tired, we sailed towards the south, seeking out the 
coastline or any speck of land where we might find some rest. It was nothing but 
blind good fortune that made us sail into the fjord of Alexandrovsk, so that we 
were able to tie up to a buoy left behind by the American fleet. It required 
several further hours before we could be sure of our whereabouts or that the 
Americans had taken their leave. Behind the craggy wall of snow appeared a black 
column of smoke which, from a considerable distance, gradually approached us as 
we and our ship rested on the water.</p>

<p class="fst">Then, it seemed from out of the very wall of the cliff, a steam 
tug boat appeared, and finally we saw a large red flag. This was for us a sign 
that we had arrived in the Land of the Communists. After a while a motor-boat 
hove into view, filled with armed men. We took hold of a tow rope and sailed 
between the cliff walls inland in the direction of Murmansk. We were received as 
Comrades, and thereafter travelled on the railway, built during the war, to 
Petrograd now Leningrad.</p>

<p class="fst">In Leningrad, after we had spoken with Zinoviev, the Chairman of 
the Communist International, we travelled on to Moscow. There, a few days after 
our arrival, we delivered our statement to the Executive Committee of the 
Communist International. Our case was discussed, but as to who spoke and what 
was said I no longer have any recollection. However, we did not receive an 
honest reply, except that we were told that we were shortly to be received by 
Lenin himself. And indeed, this did then occur, after about a week or a little 
longer.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin, of course, opposed our and the KAPD's standpoint. During 
the course of a second reception, a little while later, he gave us his answer. 
This he did by reading to us extracts from his pamphlet "Left Wing Communism - 
An Infantile Disorder"<a href="#n0">[6]</a>, selecting those passages which he considered 
relevant to our case. He held the manuscript of this document which had not yet 
been printed, in his hand. The Communist International's reply, delivered 
initially by Lenin himself, was that the viewpoint of the ECCI was the same as 
that of the KPD, which we had already left.</p>

<p class="fst">After a fairly long return journey via Murmansk and Norway, it 
became necessary for Jan Appel to disappear from view, and my activities in 
Germany were continued by Jan Arndt. Working whenever necessary to keep body and 
soul together, in Seefeld near Spandau and in Ammerndorf near Halle, and 
speaking in meetings from time to time - this was the tenor of my life. Much the 
same kind of activity took place in the Rhineland and the Ruhr, where I was also 
instrumental in organising the regular publication of the AAUD's journal "Der 
Klassenkampf" <span class="inote">[Class Struggle]</span>. In 1920 the KAPD had been accepted as a 
sympathising party into the Third International. This had come about as a result 
of discussion between the ECCI and certain leading members of the KAPD. The 
latter consisted of Herman Gorter from Holland, Karl Schröder from Berlin, Otto 
Rühle the former SPD Reichstag deputy, and Fritz Rasch. At the Third Congress of 
the Communist International in Moscow, we were afforded every freedom to express 
our point of view concerning the kind of policy which should guide our work. But 
we met with no agreement from the delegates from the other countries present. 
The main content of the decisions which were adopted at this Congress held that 
we should continue to cooperate with the KPD in the old unions and in the 
democratic assemblies, and that we should let drop our slogan "All Power to the 
Workers' Councils!"</p>

<p class="fst">This was the well known policy as set forth in the "21 Points" 
which we should follow if we wished to remain an affiliated organisation of the 
Communist International. We, of course, spoke up against this and declared that 
a decision on this could only be taken by the relevant organ of the KAPD. This 
indeed was done upon our return. Then I went back to the Ruhr and to 
Rhineland-Westphalia to begin activity once again, just as before the Congress. 
This spell of activity was brought to an end in November 1923 as a result of my 
arrest. The immediate cause of this was the occupation of the Rhineland and the 
Ruhr by the French, but since the indictment was one of stealing a ship <span class="inote">[i.e. 
piracy]</span>, this could only be heard in Hamburg. I narrowly succeeded in avoiding 
extradition <span class="inote">[to the non occupied part of Germany]</span> by representing myself as a 
political prisoner and invoking the assistance of the French occupation 
authorities. However, since an extradition agreement between Germany and the 
Allied powers was imminent, I agreed voluntarily to a deportation order to 
Hamburg. There I was tried and sentenced, and so spent time in prison. This came 
to an end at Christmas 1925.</p>

<p class="fst">In April 1926 I went to Zaandam in Holland to earn my living as a 
shipyard worker. Immediately upon my arrival I wrote to a comrade, whom I did 
not know personally but whose address had been given to me. It was Henk 
Canne-Meijer. Together with Piet Kurman, he looked me up in Zaandam. Both held 
views identical to those of the KAPD, and they had broken with the Communist 
Party of Holland. But they had no contact with the existing KAP group in 
Holland. They were both good friends of Herman Gorter. We exchanged our views 
and experiences, and held regular meetings with others of like mind. In this way 
we gradually crystallised into a group which we called the Group of 
International Communists <span class="inote">[GIK]</span>. The publication of our positions and analyses 
took place through the PSIC <span class="inote">[Press Service of International Communists]</span>, which 
is the information organ of the International Communists.</p>

<p class="fst">During my time in the remand prison in Düsseldorf, a period of 
altogether seventeen months, I had found the opportunity to study Volumes I and 
II of Marx's Capital. Coming as I did from years of revolutionary struggle, 
followed by internal factional strife within the Communist Movement and the 
recognition of the fact that the Russian Revolution had led to the consolidation 
of a state economy under the rule of a party apparatus, such that we were 
compelled to coin the term "state communism" or even finally "state capitalism"<a href="#n0">[7]</a> in order to describe it, I finally came to reach an overall unified view. 
The time for considered, consciously evaluated thought had arrived; the time at 
which one allows all past experience and activity to pass in review before one's 
inner eye, so as to find the road which we workers must take in order to leave 
behind the oppression of capitalism and to reach the liberating goal of 
communism.</p>

<p class="fst">As a revolutionary worker, I came through a study of Marx's 
Capital to understand the capitalist world as I had never understood it before. 
How it is compelled to follow an intrinsic, law governed development; how its 
basic order unfolds over a long period, overcoming all conditions inherited from 
the pre-capitalist past in order to consolidate its mode of production, and thus 
forming the seed bed for new and yet more intense contradictions in its internal 
order; how it brings about ever and again new changes to its internal social 
structure, but simultaneously its most basic contradictions are pushed forward 
to new and ever more glaring levels of antagonism. It first expropriates the 
working people from the soil and their piece of land; then it appropriates their 
independent means of life and so creates the conditions in which it can also 
appropriate the products of their labour. The right of disposal over the fruits 
of labour, and hence over the producers themselves, falls into ever fewer hands. 
Furthermore, the truth that the sole achievements of the Russian Revolution were 
that the Russian Communist Party had been constituted as a totally centralised 
despotic instrument of power, equipped with all necessary means for exercising 
state oppression over the still dispossessed and propertyless producers was a 
fact we were forced to recognise.</p>

<p class="fst">But our thoughts went further: the most profound and intense 
contradiction in human society resides in the fact that, in the last analysis, 
the right of decision over the conditions of production, over what and how much 
is produced and in what quantity, is taken away from the producers themselves 
and placed in the hands of highly centralised organs of power. Today, over forty 
years after I first came to this awareness as I sat in prison, I see this 
development unfolding to an ever greater degree in all parts of the world. This 
basic division in human society can only be overcome when the producers finally 
assume their right of control over the conditions of their labour, over what 
they produce and how they produce it. On this subject I wrote many pages while I 
was in prison. It was with these thoughts in mind and with the writings relevant 
to them, that I arrived in Holland to see the Group of International Communists.</p>

<p class="fst">[......]</p>

<p class="fst">Today, in the year 1966, forty years have passed since we first 
met together in Amsterdam as the Group of International Communists <span class="inote">[GIK]</span>, in 
order to express our new thoughts and to discuss them. The knowledge that the 
Russian Revolution was leading to the establishment of state communism, or more 
accurately state capitalism, represented a new school of thought at the time. It 
also necessitated disillusioning oneself of the view that a Communist form of 
society, which also implies the liberation of labour from the shackles of 
wage-slavery, would be the necessary and direct outcome of the Russian 
Revolution. It was likewise a wholly new conception to concentrate one's 
attention upon the essence of the process of liberation from wage-slavery, that 
is to say, upon the exercise of power by the factory organisations, the Workers' 
Councils, in their assumption of control over the factories and places of work; 
in order that flowing from this, the unit of the average social hour of labour, 
as the measure of the production times of all goods and services in both 
production and distribution, might be introduced.</p>

<p class="fst">In this way money and all other forms of value would be abolished 
and so deprived of their power to manifest themselves as Capital, as the social 
force which enslaves human beings and exploits them. This knowledge and its 
fruit, gained over long periods of work in the Group of International Communists 
in Amsterdam, have been brought together in ordered form in the book 
"<a href="../../../subject/left-wing/gik/1930/index.htm">Fundamental Principles of communist Production and Distribution</a>" 
<span class="inote">[Grundprinzipien kommunistischer Produktion und Verteilung]</span>, published by 
ourselves. It consists of 169 pages<a href="#n0">[8]</a> of typewritten script. In order to gain 
a brief insight into what is written there, the following excerpt from the 
Foreword<a href="#n0">[9]</a> may be quoted:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The Fundamental Principles of Communist Production and 
Distribution had their origin during a 4 year period of group discussions and 
controversy within the Group of International Communists of Holland. The first 
edition appeared in the year 1930 in Germany, published in Berlin by the Neue 
Arbeiterverlag <span class="inote">[New Workers Publishing House]</span>, the publishing organ of the AAUD, 
the revolutionary factory organisation. On account of financial difficulties, a 
Dutch edition in the desired format and published at the required time proved to 
be beyond our capabilities. Instead, it was published in serial form as a 
supplement to the Press Information Service of the Group of International 
Communists, <span class="inote">[PSIC]</span> On account of the translation, this edition is not quite 
identical with the German one, although nothing essential in the content has 
been altered. The only amendments were in the order in which the material was 
presented and in the various formulations, in order to attain a clearer 
presentation. It is hoped that the 'Fundamental Principles of Communist 
Production and Distribution' will lead to a thorough discussion and so 
contribute both to greater clarity and to unity of aim within the revolutionary 
proletariat, and so result in the various tendencies adopting a common course."</p>

<p class="fst">In a new edition it was written:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"This book can only express in economic terms what must first be 
achieved in the sphere of political action. For this it was necessary to begin, 
not merely with the abolition of private property in the means of production, 
but with the elimination of wage labour as such. It is from this basis that all 
our thoughts proceed. Our analysis therefore led to the inescapable conclusion 
that, once the workers have won power through their mass organisations, they 
will be able to hold on to that power only provided that they eliminate 
wage-labour from all economic life and instead adopt as the nodal point of all 
economic activity the duration of labour time expended in the production of all 
use values, as the equivalent measure replacing money values, and around which 
the whole of economic life would revolve."</p>

<p class="fst">The German edition of the year 1930 was later seized and 
destroyed. A short précis was subsequently published in New York,<a href="#n0">[10]</a> and also a 
German version in the journal "Kampfsignal" <span class="inote">[A call to struggle]</span>; whilst in 1955 
in Chicago, an English language version appeared in "Council 
Correspondence".<a href="#n0">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">I participated personally in the political activity of the GIK in 
Holland. In April of 1933 it was made known to me that "a friendly Germany" 
wished to see me once again. I was to be expelled as an "undesirable alien"! 
However, the helpful Police Commissioner in Amsterdam afforded me the time in 
which to bring my personal affairs into order. The moment had come once again to 
go "underground". Jan Appel once more disappeared from the scene. When, later, 
the Second World War finally broke out, I began to play a part in the resistance 
movement directed against the régime of the Hitler fascists, who had occupied 
the country in 1940.</p>

<p class="fst">After Sneevliet, the well known leader of the Left in Holland, 
together with between 13 to 18 other comrades, had been executed by firing 
squad, we continued to pursue the resistance struggle with the remainder of the 
comrades. After 1945 we published the weekly journal "Spartacus".<a href="#n0">[12]</a> This 
continued until 1948. As a result of a serious street accident which I suffered 
at this time, I had to be placed in hospital, and so once again reappeared on 
the surface of social life. A testament from over 20 bourgeois citizens, good 
and true, was required in order to protect me from being simply pushed over the 
border! That I had been active in the resistance movement decided the issue in 
my favour. Jan Appel made his appearance once again, but it was necessary for 
him to refrain for a time from all political activity.</p>

<p class="fst">This is also the end of this volume of my life history.</p>
