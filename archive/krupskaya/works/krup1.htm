In the course of his revolutionary activities Lenin often
    wrote and spoke about the emancipation of working women in general
    and peasant women in particular. To be sure, the emancipation of
    women is inseparably bound up with the entire struggle for the
    workers' cause, for socialism. We know Lenin as the leader of the
    working people, as the organiser of the Party and Soviet
    government, as a fighter and builder. Every working woman, every
    peasant woman must know about all that Lenin did, every aspect of
    his work, without limiting herself to what Lenin said about the
    position of working women and their emancipation. But because
    there exists the closest connection between the entire struggle of
    the working class and improving the position of women, Lenin
    often--on more than forty occasions, in fact--referred to this
    question in his speeches and articles, and every one of these
    references was inseparably bound up with all the other things that
    were of interest and concern to him at the time.</P>

    <P>  From the very start of his revolutionary career Comrade Lenin
    paid special attention to the position of women workers and
    peasants and to drawing them into the working-class
    movement. Lenin did his first practical revolutionary work in
    St. Petersburg (now Leningrad), where he organised a group of
    Social-Democrats which became extremely active among the
    St. Petersburg workers, publishing illegal leaflets and
    distributing them at factories. The leaflets were usually
    addressed to the workmen. At that time the class consciousness of
    the mass of the workers was still little developed, the most
    backward among them being working women. They received very low
    wages and their rights were flagrantly violated. So the leaflets
    were usually addressed to the men (the two leaflets addressed to
    the working women of the Laferm tobacco factory were an
    exception). Lenin also wrote a leaflet for the workers of the
    Tornton cloth mill (in 1895) and although the women working there
    were most backward, he entitled the leaflet: "To the Working Men
    and Women of the Tornton Mill." This is a detail, but a very
    important one.</P>

    <P>  When he was in exile in 1899, Lenin corresponded with the
    Party organisation (the First Party Congress was held in 1898) and
    mentioned the subjects he wanted to write about in the illegal
    press. These included a pamphlet called "Women and the Workers'
    Cause". In this pamphlet Lenin intended to describe the position
    of women factory workers and peasant women and to show that the
    only salvation for them was through their participation in the
    revolutionary movement, and that only the victory of the working
    class would bring emancipation to women workers and peasants.</P>

    <P> Writing in 1901 about the women who took part in the Obukhov
    defence, about the speech delivered by a woman worker Marfa
    Yakovleva in court, Lenin said:</P>

    <P>  "The memory of our heroic comrades murdered and tortured to
    death in prison will increase tenfold the strength of the new
    fighters and will rouse thousands to rally to their aid, and like
    the eighteen-year-old Marfa Yakovleva, they will openly say:'We
    stand by our brothers!' In addition to reprisals by the police and
    the military against participants in demonstrations, the
    government intends to prosecute them for rebellion; we will
    retaliate by uniting our revolutionary forces and winning over to
    our side all who are oppressed by the tyranny of tsarism, and by
    systematically preparing for the uprising of the whole
    people!"[CW, Vol 5, p248-9] Lenin made a close study of the life
    and labour conditions of women factory workers, peasants and women
    employed in the handicrafts.</P>

    <P> While in prison, Lenin studied the position of peasants as
    revealed by statistical reports; he studied the influence of the
    handicrafts, the drift of the peasants to the factories and the
    influence exerted by the factories on their culture and way of
    life. At the same time he studied all these questions from the
    viewpoint of women's labour. He pointed out that the peasant's
    proprietorial psychology places on women a burden of unnecessary
    and senseless drudgery (every peasant woman of a large family
    clearing only the small part of the table she eats on, cooking a
    separate meal for her own child and milking a cow to get only just
    enough milk for her own child).</P>

    <P>  In his book <EM>The Development of Capitalism in Russia</EM>
    Lenin describes how cattle farmers exploit peasant women, how the
    merchant-buyers exploit women lace-weavers; he shows that
    large-scale industry emancipates women and that the work at
    factories broadens their outlook, makes them more cultured and
    independent and helps them to break the shackles of patriarchal
    life. Lenin said that the development of large-scale industry
    would create the basis for complete emancipation of
    women. Characteristic in this respect is Lenin's article "A Great
    Technical Achievement" written in 1913.</P>

    <P>  Workers in the bourgeois countries must fight for equal rights for men and women.</P>
    <P> In exile Lenin devoted much of his time to working out the
    Party programme. At that time the Party had no programme. There
    was only a draft programme compiled by the Emancipation of Labour
    group. Examining this programme in his article "A Draft Programme
    of Our Party" and commenting on #9 of the practical part of the
    programme, which demanded "the revision of our entire civil and
    criminal legislation, the abolition of social-estate divisions and
    of punishments incompatible with the dignity of man", Lenin wrote
    that it would be well to add here: <EM>"complete equality of
    rights for men and women."</EM> [CW Vol 4, p239] (My
    italics--N. K.)</P>

    <P> In 1903, when the Party Programme was adopted, this clause was included in it.</P>
    <P>  In 1907, in his report on the International Congress in
    Stuttgart Lenin noted with satisfaction that the Congress
    condemned the opportunist practices of the Austrian
    Social-Democrats who, while conducting a campaign for electoral
    rights for men, put off the struggle for electoral rights for
    women to "a later date".</P>

    <P>  The Soviet government established full equality of rights for men and women.</P>
    <P>  "We in Russia no longer have the base, mean and infamous
    denial of rights to women or inequality of the sexes, that
    disgusting survival of feudalism and medievalism which is being
    renovated by the avaricious bourgeoisie ... in every other country
    in the world without exception." </P>

    <P>In 1913, studying the forms of bourgeois democracy and exposing
    the hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie, Lenin also dealt with the
    problem of prostitution and showed how, while encouraging white
    slave traffic and raping girls in the colonies, representatives of
    the bourgeoisie at the same time hypocritically pretended to be
    campaigning against prostitution.</P>

    <P> Lenin returned to this question in December 1919, when he
    wrote that "free, civilised" America was touting for women for
    bawdy houses in the vanquished countries.[CW Vol 30]</P>

    <P> In close connection with this question Lenin examined the
    question of child-bearing and indignantly wrote of the appeal of
    some intellectuals to the workers to practise birth control on the
    grounds that their children were doomed to poverty and
    privation. This is a petty-bourgeois view, wrote Lenin. The
    workers take a different view. Children are our future. As for
    poverty and so on, this can be remedied. We are fighting against
    capitalism and when we win a victory we shall build a bright
    future for our children....</P>

    <P>  And finally, in 1916-17, when he could see the socialist
    revolution was drawing near and was considering what the essential
    elements of socialist construction would be, and how to draw the
    masses into this construction, he particularly stressed the need
    to draw working women into social work, the need to enable all
    women to work for the benefit of society. <EM>Eight</EM> of his
    articles written in this period deal with this question, which he
    links up with the need to organise social life under socialism
    along new lines. Lenin saw a direct connection between this and
    the drawing of the most backward groups of women into the work of
    ruling the country, the need for re-educating the masses in the
    actual process of social work.</P>

    <P> Social work teaches the art of government. "We are not
    utopians," Lenin wrote before the October Revolution. "We know
    that an unskilled labourer or a cook cannot immediately get on
    with the job of state administration. In this we agree with the
    Cadets, with Breshkovskaya, and with Tsereteli. We differ,
    however. from these citizens in that we demand an immediate break
    with the prejudiced view that only the rich, or officials chosen
    from rich families, are capable of <EM>administering</EM> the
    state, of performing the ordinary, everyday work of
    administration. We demand that <EM>training</EM> in the work of
    state administration be conducted by class-conscious workers and
    soldiers and that this training be begun at once, i.e., that a
    <EM>beginning</EM> be made at once in training all the working
    people, all the poor, for this work."</P>

    <P>  We know that the Soviet government has done all it can to
    draw working women in the town and countryside into the work of
    administration. And we know what great successes have been
    achieved on this front.</P>

    <P>  Lenin warmly greeted the awakening of the women of the Soviet
    East. Since he attached particular importance to raising the level
    of the nationalities that had been oppressed by tsarism and
    capitalism, it is quite understandable why he so warmly greeted
    the conference of delegates of the Women's Departments of Soviet
    regions and republics in the East.</P>

    <P>  Speaking of the achievements of the Second Congress of the
    Communist International, Lenin pointed out that "the Congress will
    strengthen the ties with the communist movement of women, thanks
    to the international conference of working women called at the
    same time."[CW Vol 31]</P>

    <P>  In October 1932 we observed the fifteenth anniversary of
    Soviet power and summed up our achievements on all fronts,
    including the front of women's emancipation.</P>

    <P>  We know that women took a very active part in the Civil War,
    that many of them died in action but many others were steeled in
    battle. Some women were awarded the Order of the Red Banner for
    the active part they played in the struggle for Soviets during the
    Civil War. Many former women partisans now occupy important
    posts. Women have been persistent in learning to conduct social
    work.</P>

    <P> Delegates' conferences are a school of social work. In 15
    years almost 10 million women delegates have passed through this
    school.</P>

    <P>  At the time when we observed the fifteenth anniversary of the
    October Revolution 20 to 25 per cent of the deputies of the
    village Soviets, district executive committees and city Soviets
    were women. There were 186 women members of the All-Russia Central
    Executive Committee and the Central Executive Committee of the
    U.S.S.R. On this work they attain ever higher standards.</P>

    <P> The number of women members of the Communist Party has also
    been steadily growing. In 1922 there were only 40,000 but by
    October 1932 the number exceeded 500,000.</P>

    <P> Much progress has been made recently in fulfilling Lenin's
    behest concerning the complete emancipation of women.</P>
	
    <P>  In the last few years large-scale industry has been
    developing on a tremendous scale. It is being reorganised on the
    basis of modern technology and scientific organisation of
    labour. The socialist emulation and shock-workers' movement which
    have now been widely adopted stimulate a new, communist attitude
    towards labour. And it must be said that women are not lagging
    behind men in this. Every day we see more and more front-rank
    women workers who display great stamina and perseverance in
    labour. Labour is not something women have to get used to. Under
    the old regime the lives of women were full of continual, unending
    labour, but it was the kind of labour that was looked down upon
    and bore the imprint of bondage. And now this labour training and
    perseverance in labour place women in the front ranks of the
    builders of socialism and heroes of labour.</P>

    <P>  Collectivisation of agriculture was of the utmost importance
    for the emancipation of women. From the very start Lenin regarded
    the collectivisation of agriculture as a way of reorganising it
    along socialist lines. Back in 1894, in his book <EM>What the
    Friends of the People Are</EM> Lenin quoted Marx's words to the
    effect that after "the expropriation of the expropriators" is
    accomplished, that is, when the landowners are dispossessed of
    their landed estates and the capitalists of their factories, free workers will be united into co-operatives and the communal ("collective", as Lenin explained) ownership of the land and the means of production they create will be established.</P>
    <P>  Following the October Revolution, which marked the beginning
    of "the expropriation of the expropriators", the Soviet government
    raised the question of organising agricultural artels and
    communes. Particular attention was paid to this back in 1918 and
    1919, but many years passed (as Lenin had predicted) before
    collectivisation became extensive and struck deep roots. The years
    of the Civil War, when the class struggle swept the country, the
    progress of Soviet power in the villages, the help, the cultural
    assistance rendered by the Soviet government to the
    countryside--all this prepared the ground for collectivisation,
    which is developing and growing stronger in the struggle against
    the kulaks.</P>

    <P>  Small-scale and middle peasant farming shackled women, tied
    them to the individual households, and narrowed their outlook;
    they were in fact slaves of their husbands, who often beat them
    cruelly. Small scale farming paved the way for religion. The
    peasants used to say: "Each man for himself and God for all."
    Lenin quoted this saying on many occasions, as it perfectly
    expressed the psychology of a small proprietor. Collectivisation
    transforms the peasant from a small proprietor into a
    collectivist, undermines the peasants' isolation and the hold of
    religion and emancipates women. Lenin said that socialism alone
    would bring emancipation for women. His words are now coming
    true. We can see how women's position has changed in the
    collective farms.</P>

    <P>  The Congress of front-rank collective farmers held in the
    middle of February is striking evidence of the headway made in the
    collective cultivation of the land. There are now 200,000
    collective farms, as compared with the 6,000 we had before. The
    Congress discussed the question of the best way to organise work
    on the collective farms. There were many women among the
    delegates. Sopina, a collective farmer from the Central Black
    Earth Region, made a fine speech which evoked thunderous
    applause. When  she takes a hand in collective-farm development,
    the peasant woman grows in stature, learns to govern and to fight
    resolutely against the kulaks, the class enemy....</P>

<P>
      Religion is losing Ground. Now collective-farm women come to the
      library and say: "You always give me books that simply say that
      there is no God. I know that without reading books. Give me a
      book that will tell me how and why religion arose and how and
      why it will die away." In the last few years there has been a
      tremendous growth of political consciousness of the
      masses. Political departments at the machine and tractor
      stations' (whose membership also includes women's organisers)
      will help not only to consolidate the collective farms, but will
      also help collective farmers, men and women, to get rid of
      surviving prejudices and cultural backwardness; lack of rights
      for women will become a thing of the past.</P>

    <P>  Ten years have passed since the day of Lenin's death. On that
    sad day we shall check the fulfilment of all of Lenin's
    behests. We shall sum up the results. Lenin's behest concerning
    the emancipation of women is being fulfilled under the guidance of
    the Party. We shall continue to advance along this path.</P>
