The Years of The War</h1>
<H4>Berne 1914-1915</H4>
<hr class="end">
<BR>
<P>At last, on September 5, we entered Switzerland and proceeded to Berne.</P>
<p>
We had not definitely decided vet where we were going to
live &#8211; in Geneva or Berne. Ilyich felt drawn to the old familiar
home &#8211; Geneva, where he had worked so well in the old days at the
Societe de lecture, where there had been a good Russian
library. Our Berne comrades, however, assured us that Geneva had
changed a good deal and was now crowded with emigrants from other
cities and from France, and the place was a regular
hurry-burly. We took a room in Berne for the time being without
definitely deciding anything.</P>
<p>
Ilyich immediately got in touch with Geneva to find out
whether there were any people there who were going to Russia (they
had to be made use of for establishing contacts with Russia),
whether the Russian printing
plant still existed, whether Russian leaflets could be printed there, and so on.</P>
<p>
The day after our arrival from Galicia, all the Bolsheviks
then living in Berne &#8211; Shklovsky, the Safarovs, Duma Deputy
Samoilov, Goberman, and others &#8211; got together and arranged a
conference in the woods, at which Ilyich expounded his views on
current events. As a result a resolution was adopted
characterizing the war as an imperialist predatory war and the
conduct of the leaders of the Second International, who had voted
for war credits, as a betrayal of the cause of the
proletariat. The resolution stated that "from the point of view of
the working class and the toiling masses of all the peoples of
Russia the lesser evil would be the defeat of the tsarist monarchy
and its armies, which are oppressing Poland, the Ukraine and
various other peoples in Russia." The resolution launched the
slogan of propaganda for a socialist revolution, civil war, and an
implacable struggle against chauvinism and patriotism to be waged
in all countries without exception, and outlined a programme of
action for Russia, namely, struggle against the monarchy,
propaganda for the revolution, the fight for a republic, for the
liberation of the nationalities oppressed by the "Great Russians,"
for the confiscation of the landowners' estates and for the
eight-hour day.</P>
<p>
The Berne resolution was in substance a challenge to the
whole capitalist world. It was not written, of course, to be
shelved. It was first of all sent to all the Bolshevik sections
abroad. Then Samoilov took the theses with him for discussion with
the Central Committee section in Russia and the Duma group. It was
not known yet what stand they took Communication with Russia was
broken off. We did not learn until later that the Russia section
of the Central Committee and the Bolshevik section of the Duma
group had struck the right note from the very start. For the
advanced workers of our country, for our Party organization, the
resolutions of international congresses on the war were not mere
scraps of paper. They were a guide to action.</P>
<p>
In the early days of the war, when mobilization had only
just been declared, the Central Committee issued a leaflet with
the appeal: "Down with war! War against war!" A number of
factories in St. Petersburg went on strike on the day the reserves
were mobilized, and an attempt was even made to organize a
demonstration. But the war had called forth such a violent
outburst of Black-Hundred patriotism and strengthened the military
reaction to such an extent that nothing much could be done. Our
Duma group took a firm stand against war and continued the line of
struggle against the tsarist rule. This firmness impressed even
the Mensheviks, and the Social-Democratic group as a whole adopted
a resolution which was read from the Duma tribune. The resolution
was very cautiously worded`and left many things unsaid, but it was
a resolution of protest nevertheless and roused indignation among
the rest of the Duma deputies. Feeling ran particularly high when
the Social-Democratic group, still acting together, abstained from
voting on war credits and walked out in a body as a demonstration
of protest. The Bolshevik organization quickly went deep
underground and began to issue leaflets containing directions how
to utilize the war in the interests of developing and intensifying
the revolutionary struggle. Anti-war propaganda was started in the
provinces too. Local reports pointed to the fact that this
propaganda had the support of the revolutionary-minded workers. We
abroad learned about all this much later.</P>
<p>
Fretting as they did in the dreary atmosphere of emigrant
life abroad, from which they were so eager to escape, and having
had no direct experience of the revolutionary upsurge which had
taken place in Russia in recent months, our Bolshevik groups
abroad lacked the firmness which our Duma deputies and the
Bolshevik organizations in Russia had evinced. People were not
clear on the question, and spoke mostly about which side was the
attacking side.</P>
<p>
In Paris, in the long run, the majority of the group
expressed themselves against the war and volunteering, but some
comrades &#8211; Sapozhkov (Kuznetsov), Kazakov (Britman, Sviagin), Misha
Edisherov (Davydov), Moiseyev (Ilya, Zefir) and others &#8211; joined the
French army as volunteers. The Menshevik, Bolshevik and
Socialist-Revolutionary volunteers (about eighty men in all)
adopted a declaration in the name of the "Russian Republicans,"
which was printed in the French press. Plekhanov made a farewell
speech in honour of the volunteers before they left Paris.</P>
<p>
The majority of our Paris group condemned volunteering. But in
the other groups, too, there was no definite clarity on the
question. Vladimir Ilyich realized how important it was at such a
serious moment for every Bolshevik to have a clear understanding
of the significance of events. A comradely exchange of opinions
was necessary it was inadvisable to fix all shades of opinion
right away until the matter had been threshed out. That is why, in
his answer to Karpinsky's letter framing the views of the Geneva
section, Ilyich wrote: "Would not this 'criticism' and my
'anti-criticism' make a better subject for discussion?"</P>
<P>Ilyich knew that an understanding could more easily be reached
in a comradely discussion than by correspondence. Of course, this
was no time to keep such an issue long confined to comradely talks
within a narrow circle of Bolsheviks.</P>
<p>
Early in October we found out that Plekhanov, who had
returned from Paris, had already addressed a meeting in Geneva and
was going to read a paper in Lausanne.</P>
<p>
Plekhanov's position worried Ilyich very much. He could not
believe that Plekhanov had become a "defencist." "I just can't
believe it," he said, adding thoughtfully, "it must be the effect
of his military past." When a telegram was received from Lausanne
on October 10, saying that the lecture was scheduled for the next
day, the 11th, Ilyich got busy preparing his speech, and I took
care to relieve him of all other business, and arranged with our
people who was to go from Berne, etc. We had settled down in Berne
for good. The Zinovievs were living there, too, by that time (they
had arrived a fortnight after us), and so was Inessa.</P>
<p>
I could not go to the lecture myself, and learned all about
it afterwards from the others. After reading F. Ilyin's memoirs
about that lecture in the <EM>Transactions of the Lenin
Institute,</EM> and knowing what it had meant to Ilyich at the
time, I can picture the whole thing quite vividly. Inessa gave me
a lull account of it afterwards too. Our people came to the
lecture from all over. Zinoviev, Inessa and Shklovsky came from
Berne, Rozmirovich, Krylenko, Bukharin and the Lausanne comrades
came from Baugy, near Clarens.</P>
<p>
Ilyich was afraid he would not be admitted to Plekhanov's
lecture and say what he had to say &#8211; the Mensheviks might not let
in so many Bolsheviks. I can imagine how reluctant he was to see
people and carry on small talk with them, and I can understand the
naive ruses he devised to shake them off. I can clearly see him
amid the dinner-table bustle at the Movshovichs', so withdrawn,
absorbed and agitated that he could not swallow a bite. One can
understand the rather forced humour of the remark uttered in an
undertone to those sitting next to him about Plekhanov's opening
speech, in which the latter had declared that he had not been
prepared to address such a large audience. "The slyboots," Ilyich
muttered, and gave himself up entirely to hearing what Plekhanov
had to say. The first part of the lecture in which Plekhanov
attacked the Germans had his approval, and he applauded it. In the
second part, however, Plekhanov set forth his
"defence-of-the-country" views. There was no room for doubt any
more. Ilyich asked for the floor &#8211; he was the only one to do so. He
went up to the speaker's table with a pot of beer in his hand. He
spoke calmly, and only the pallor of his face betraved his
agitation. He said in effect that the war was not an accidental
occurrence, that the way for it had been paved by the whole nature
of the development of bourgeois society. The international
congresses at Stuttgart, Copenhagen and Basle had defined what the
attitude of the Socialists should be towards the impending
war. Only by combatting the chauvinist intoxication in their
countries would the Social-Democrats be fulfilling their duty. The
war, which had just begun, ought to be converted into a decisive
fight against the ruling classes on the part of the
proletariat.</P>
<p>
Ilyich had only ten minutes. He could only deal with the bare
essentials. Plekhanov retorted with his usual display of wit. The
Mensheviks, who were an overwhelming majority, wildly applauded
him. The impression was that Plekhanov had won the day.</P>
<p>
Three days later, on October 14, in the same hall where
Plekhanov had spoken &#8211; the Maison du Peuple &#8211; Ilyich was to deliver
his own lecture. The hall was packed. Tile lecture was a great
success. Ilyich was in a buoyant fighting mood. He elaborated his
views on the war, which he branded as an imperialist war. He
pointed out in his speech that a leaflet against the war had
already been issued in Russia by the Central Committee and that
similar leaflets had been issued by the Caucasian organization and
other groups. He pointed out that the best socialist newspaper in
Europe at the moment was <EM>Golos (Voice),</EM> in which Martov
was writing. "The more often and seriously I have disagreed with
Martov," he said, "the more definitely must I now say that this
writer is doing just what a Social-Democrat should do. He is
criticizing his government, denouncing the bourgeoisie of his own
country, railing against its ministers."</P>
<p>
In private conversation Ilyich often remarked what a good
thing it would be if Martov came over to our side altogether. But
he doubted whether Martov would stick to his present position for
long. He knew how prone Martov was to yield to outside
influences. "He writes like that while he is alone," Ilyich
added. Ilyich's lecture was a tremendous success. He repeated the
same lecture &#8211; "The Proletariat and the War" &#8211; in Geneva at a later
date.</P>
<p>
Ilyich returned from his lecture trip to find a letter of
Shlyapnikov's from Stockholm informing him about the work in
Russia, about Vandervelde's telegram to the Duma group and the
replies of the Menshevik and Bolshevik deputies. When war was
declared Emile Vandervelde, Belgian representative on the
International Socialist Bureau, accepted a ministerial post in the
Belgian Government. He had been in Russia shortly before the war
and seen the struggle which the Russian workers were waging
against the autocracy, but had failed to grasp its full
import. Vandervelde had sent telegrams to both sections of the
Social-Democratic group of the Duma. Me called on the group to
help the Russian Government conduct a determined war against
Germany on the side of the Entente.</P>
<p>
The Menshevik deputies, who, for the moment, had refused to
vote for war credits, began to vacillate when they learned what
position the majority of the Socialist parties had taken up. Their
answer to Vandervelde, therefore, showed a complete change of
front. They declared in it that they would not oppose the war. The
Bolshevik group sent a reply emphatically rejecting any suggestion
of supporting the war and discontinuing the struggle against the
tsarist government. Much was left unsaid in this reply, but the
main line was correct. It showed how important it was to maintain
contact with Russia, and Ilyich strongly insisted that Shlyapnikov
should remain in Stockholm and establish still closer contact with
the Duma group and the Russians at large. This could best be
arranged through Stockholm.</P>
<p>
As soon as Ilyich arrived in Berne from Cracow, he wrote to
Karpinsky, enquiring whether it was possible to have a leaflet
printed in Geneva. The theses were adopted in Berne soon after our
arrival, and a month later it was decided to recast and publish
them in the form of a manifesto. Ilyich got in touch with
Karpinsky again concerning its publication. He sent him letters by
trusted messengers, avoiding the post and maintaining strict
secrecy. It was not clear at the time what attitude the Swiss
Government would adopt towards anti-militarist propaganda.</P>
<p>
The day after receiving Shlyapnikov's first letter, Vladimir Ilyich wrote to Karpinsky:</P>
<p>
"Dear K. Just when I happened to be in Geneva we received
<EM>gratifying</EM> news from Russia. The text of the Russian
Social-Democrats' reply to Vandervelde arrived too. We have
therefore decided, instead of a separate manifesto, to issue a
paper<EM> Sotsial-Demokrat (The Social-Democrat),</EM> the Central
Organ.... By Monday we shall send you some slight corrections to
the manifesto and a <EM>different</EM> signature (for after having
got in touch with Russia we are coming out <EM>more
officially</EM>)." </P>
<P>Ilyich went on a lecture tour again at the end of October,
first to Montreux, then to Zurich. Trotsky spoke at the lecture in
Zurich, protesting against Ilyich calling Kautsky a "traitor."
Ilyich deliberately put the case very strongly in order to make it
quite clear what line people were taking. The fight with the
defencists was in full swing.</P>
<p>
The struggle was not an internal Patty affair that concerned
Russian matters alone. It was an international affair.</P>
<p>
"The Second International is dead, vanquished by
opportunism," Vladimir Ilyich maintained. Forces had to be rallied
for a new International, the Third, purged of opportunism.</P>
<P>But what forces were there to back us?</P>
<p>
The only M.P.'s who refused to vote for war credits besides
the Russian Social-Democrats were the Serbian, of whom there were
only two in the Serbian Parliament. In Germany at the beginning of
the war everyone had voted for war credits, but already on
September 10 Karl Liebknecht, F. Mehring, Rosa Luxemburg and Clara
Zetkin had drawn up a declaration protesting against the stand
taken up by the majority of the German Social-Democrats. They got
this declaration published in the Swiss newspapers only at the end
of October, after having failed to get it published in the German
papers. The most Left position of all the German newspapers was
taken up at the very outset of the war by <EM>Bremen
B&uuml;rgerzeitung,</EM> which declared on August 23 that the
"proletarian international" was destroyed. In France the Socialist
Party headed by Guesde and Vaillant had slink to chauvinism. Among
the rank and file of the Party, however, feeling against the war
was pretty strong. Vandervelde's conduct was typical of the
Belgian Party. In Britain the chauvinism of Hyndman and the whole
British Socialist Party was rebuffed by MacDonald and Keir Hardie
of the opportunist Independent Labour Party. There was a feeling
against war in the neutral countries, but for the most part it
bore a pacifist character. More revolutionary than the others was
the Italian Socialist Party with its newspaper <EM>Avanti.</EM> It
opposed chauvinism and exposed the selfish secret motives behind
the appeals for war. It was hacked by the vast majority of the
advanced workers. On September 27 an Italo-Swiss Socialist
Conference was held at Lugano. Our theses concerning the war were
sent to this conference. The conference branded the war as an
imperialist war and called upon the international proletariat to
fight for peace.</P>
<p>
On the whole, the voices against chauvinism, the voices of
the internationalists still sounded very weak, isolated and
uncertain, but Ilyich was sure that they would grow steadily
stronger. His fighting spirit was high throughout the autumn.</P>
<p>
That autumn is associated in my mind with the colourful
picture of the Berne woods. It was a lovely autumn that year. In
Berne we lived in Distelweg, a clean, quiet little street
adjoining the Berne woods, which stretched for several
miles. Inessa lived across the road, the Zinovievs a five-minute
walk from us, and the Shklovskys a ten-minute walk. We used to
roam for hours along the woodland paths, which were bestrewn with
yellow leaves. Mostly the three of us went on these walks
together &#8211; Vladimir Ilyich, Inessa and myself. Vladimir Ilyich
spoke about his plans of struggle along international
lines. Inessa was very enthusiastic about it all. She had begun to
take a direct part in the rising struggle &#8211; she carried on
correspondence, translated various of our documents into French
and English, collected material, talked with people,
etc. Sometimes we would sit for hours on a sunny wooded hillside,
Ilyich jotting down notes for his articles and speeches, and
polishing his formulations, I studying Italian with the aid of a
Toussaint textbook, and Inessa sewing a skirt and basking in the
autumn sunshine &#8211; she had not quite recovered yet from the effects
of her imprisonment. In the evening we would all gather in
Grigory's (Zinoviev's) tiny room &#8211; the three of them, Grigory,
Lilina end their little boy Stvopa, lived in a single room &#8211; and
after playing about with little Styopa before he went to bed,
Ilyich would make a number of concrete proposals.</P>
<p>
The main points of the line of struggle were concisely
formulated by Ilyich in his letter of October 17 to
Shlyapnikov.</P>
<p>
...Kautsky <EM>"is now the most harmful of them all.</EM> No
words can describe how dangerous and mean are his sophisms which
cover up the rascality of the opportunists <EM>(in the Neue Zeit
(New Era)</EM> with smooth and slick phrases. The opportunists are
an open evil. The German centre with Kautsky at its head, a hidden
evil embellished for diplomatic purposes and dulling the eyes, the
intelligence, and the consciousness of the workers, is more
dangerous than anything else. Our task at present is a determined
and open struggle against international opportunism and those who
shield it (Kautsky). This is what we are going to do in the
Central Organ which we shall soon issue (probably two pages). One
must exert every effort to uphold the just hatred of the
class-conscious workers for the hideous conduct of the Germans;
one must draw from this hatred political conclusions
<EM>against</EM> opportunism and <EM>against</EM> every concession
to opportunism. This is an international task. It devolves upon
us; there is nobody else. One cannot shirk it. The slogan of
'simply' re-establishing the International is incorrect (because
the danger of a spineless conciliatory resolution along the line
of Kautsky and Vandervelde is very, very great!). The slogan of
"peace" is incorrect, as the slogan must be: converting the
national war into civil war. (This conversion may take a long
time, it may and will demand a number of preliminary conditions,
but the work must all be conducted <EM>along the line of such</EM>
a change, in this spirit and in this direction.) Not the
sabotaging of the war, not undertaking sporadic individual acts in
this direction, but the conducting of mass propaganda (and not
only among 'civilians') that leads to the conversion of the war
into civil war. In Russia, chauvinism hides behind phrases about
<EM>la belle France</EM> and unfortunate Belgium (how about the
Ukraine and others?), or behind the 'popular' hatred for the
Germans (and 'Kaiserism'). It is therefore our absolute duty to
struggle against those sophisms. In order that the struggle may
proceed along a definite and clear line, one must have a slogan
that summarizes it. This slogan is: For us <EM>Russians,</EM> from
the point of view of the interests of the labouring masses and the
working class of Russia, there cannot be the slightest doubt,
absolutely no doubt whatever, that the <EM>lesser</EM> evil would
be, here and now, the <EM>defeat</EM> of tsarism in the present
war. For tsarism is a hundred times worse than Kaiserism. Not the
sabotage of the war, but a struggle against chauvinism, all
propaganda and agitation directed towards international rallying
(drawing together, expressing solidarity, reaching agreements<EM>
selon les circonstances)</EM> of the proletariat for the purpose
of civil war. It would also be erroneous both to appeal for
<EM>individual</EM> acts of firing at officers, etc., and to allow
arguments like the one which says: We do not want to help
Kaiserism. The former is a deviation towards anarchism, the latter
towards opportunism. As to ourselves, we must prepare a mass (at
least a collective) action in the army, not of one nation alone,
and conduct <EM>all</EM> the work of propaganda and agitation in
this direction. To direct the work (stubborn, systematic work that
may require a long time) in the spirit of converting the national
war into civil war &#8211; this is the whole issue. The moment for such a
transformation is a different question; at present it is not clear
as yet. We must allow this moment to ripen, we must systematically
'force it to ripen.'...</P>
<p>
"The peace slogan is in my judgement incorrect at the present
moment. This is a philistine's, a preacher's slogan. The
proletarian slogan must be civil war.</P>
<p>
"Objectively, from the fundamental change in the situation of
Europe, there follows such a slogan for the epoch of mass war. The
same slogan follows from the Basle resolution.</P>
<p>
"We can neither 'promise' civil war nor 'decree it,' but it
is our duty to work in <EM>this direction,</EM> if need be, for a
very long time. You will find details in the article in the
Central Organ." </P>
<p>
Two and a half months after the outbreak of the war Ilyich had
worked out a clear distinct line of struggle. It formed the
dominant note of all his subsequent activity. The international
scope of his activity gave a new tone to his whole work in
connection with Russia, gave it fresh vigour and new
colour. Without those long years of hard preliminary work devoted
to the building up of the Party and the organization of the
working class in Russia, Ilyich would not have been able to take
the right line in regard to the problems raised by the imperialist
war as quickly and firmly as he did. Had he not been in the thick
of the international struggle, he would not have been able so
firmly to lead the Russian proletariat to the victory of
October.</P>
<p>
Number 33 of <EM>Sotsial-Demokrat</EM> came out on November 1,
1914. Only five hundred copies of it were printed at first, but
later it was found necessary to increase it by another
thousand. Ilyich informed Karpinsky with joy on November 14 that
the paper had been delivered at a point near the frontier and
would soon be forwarded on.</P>
<p>
With the aid of Naine and Graber a resume of the manifesto
was printed on November 13 in <EM>La Sentinelle,</EM> a Swiss
newspaper published in French in the Neufchatel working-class
centre of Chaux-de-Fond. Ilyich was elated. We sent translations
of the manifesto to French, English and German newspapers.</P>
<p>
With the aim of developing propaganda among the French
Vladimir Ilyich got in touch by letter with Karpinsky on the
question of arranging a lecture by Inessa in French in Geneva. He
wrote to Shlyapnikov about his addressing the Swedish
congress. Shlyapnikov did address it, and his speech was a
success. Thus little by little the Bolsheviks developed
"international action." </P>
<P>Things were worse as far as contacts with Russia were
concerned. Shlyapnikov sent some interesting material from
St. Petersburg for No. 34 of the Central Organ, but along with
this the paper had regretful occasion to publish a report about
the arrest of the five Bolshevik Duma deputies. Connections with
Russia weakened again.</P>
<p>
While waging a passionate struggle against the betrayal of
the workers cause on the part of the Second International, Ilyich
at the same time began an article on "Karl Marx" for Granat's
Encyclopaedic Dictionary as soon as we arrived in Berne. This
article, dealing with the teachings of Marx, opens with an outline
of his philosophy under two headings: "Philosophic Materialism"
and "Dialectics," followed by an exposition of Marx's economic
theory, in which he describes Marx's approach to the question of socialism and the tactics of the class struggle of the proletariat.</P>
<p>
Marx's teaching was not usually presented in this way. In
connection with the chapters on philosophic materialism and
dialectics, Ilyich began diligently to reread Hegel and other
philosophers, and kept up this study even after he had finished
the article. The object of his philosophic studies was to master
the method of transforming philosophy into a concrete guide to
action. His brief remarks on the dialectical approach to all
phenomena made in 1921 during the trade-union controversy with
Trotsky and Bukharin best testify to the great benefit which
Ilyich derived in this respect from his philosophic studies begun
upon his arrival in Berne; they were a continuation of his
philosophic studies of 1908-1909, when he had combatted the
Machists.</P>
<p>
Struggle and studies, study and research with Ilyich were
always strongly linked together, and closely bound up between
themselves, although they may have appeared at first sight to run
in parallels.</P>
<p>
The beginning of 1915 saw the continuation of the strenuous
work of consolidating the Bolshevik groups abroad. Definite
understanding had been achieved, but the times were such that
solidarity was needed more than ever before. Before the war the
Centre of the Bolshevik groups, known as the Committee of
Organizations Abroad, had been in Paris. Now it had to be
transferred to a neutral country &#8211; to Switzerland, to Berne, where
the office of the Central Organ was located. Agreement had to be
reached on all points &#8211; appraisal of the war, the new tasks
confronting the Party, and the methods of handling them; it was
also necessary to define the work of the groups more
definitely. The Baugy group, for instance (Krylenko, Bukharin,
Rozmirovich), decided to publish abroad their own organ <EM>Zvezda
(Star)</EM>, and went about it with such precipitancy that they
did not even arrange the matter with the Central Organ. We got to
know about this plan from Inessa. Such a publication would hardly
have been expedient in any case. There was no money with which to
publish the Central Organ, and although there were no differences
so far, they might easily arise. An unguarded phrase might be
pounced on by opponents and exaggerated in every way. We had to
keep in step together. It was such a time. A conference of groups
abroad was called in Berne at the end of February. In addition to
the Swiss groups there was the group from Paris represented by
Grisrha Belenky. He gave a full account of the defencist mood
that prevailed among the Paris group on the outbreak of the
war. The Londoners were to come, and were represented by proxy.
The Baugy group came towards the end of the conference after long
hesitation as to whether to come or not. Together with them came
the "Japanese" &#8211; as we called the Kiev comrades Pyatakov and Bosch
(sister of E.F. Rozmirovich), who had escaped from exile in
Siberia by way of Japan and America. It was a time when we
snatched desperately at every new person who was like-minded. We
liked the "Japanese." Their arrival undoubtedly strengthened our
forces abroad.</P>
<p>
The conference adopted a clear resolution on the war, debated
the United-States-of-Europe slogan (vehemently opposed by Inessa),
outlined the character of the work of the groups abroad, decided
not to publish a Baugy newspaper, and elected a new Committee of
Organizations Abroad, consisting of the Berne comrades Shklovsky,
Kasparov, Inessa Armand, Lilina and Krupskaya.</P>
<p>
Kasparov lived in Berlin before the war (1913). Ilyich heard
about him from our Baku comrades Yenukidze, Shaumyan and
others. At that period the national question had claimed Ilyich's
attention and he had been anxious to get into the closest possible
touch with those who were interested in the question and had the
right approach to it.</P>
<p>
In the summer of 1913 Kasparov had written an article for<EM>
Prosveshchenie</EM> on the national question. Ilyich had answered
him: "I have received and read your article. The subject, in my
opinion, has been chosen well and handled correctly, but it lacks
literary finish. There is too much of &#8211; shall I say? &#8211; 'agitation,'
which is unsuitable in an article on a<EM> theoretical</EM>
problem. I think you ought to rewrite it, or let us try." The
choice of a subject on the national question and its proper
exposition meant a good deal, and Ilyich immediately got
Kasparov wound up on the job of collecting material on the
national question, and concretizing the things that interested
him, confident that Kasparov would not overlook anything that was
really essential and important. Planning a short visit to Berlin
in January 1914, Ilyich wrote to Kasparov that it was necessary
for them to meet, and suggested how it was to be done.</P>
<p>
Moments of acute struggle and moments of uplift tend to bring
people closer together. The workers' movement in St. Petersburg
began developing swiftly in July 1914, and a letter was received
about the rising revolutionary tide. Until then Ilyich had always
addressed Kasparov in his letters "Dear Comrade," but on this
occasion, knowing that Kasparov welcomed the revolutionary upsurge
as enthusiastically as we did, he changed this mode of
address. "Dear friend," Ilyich wrote him. "Will you please take
the trouble of keeping us informed throughout the revolutionary
days in Russia. We do not get any newspapers. Please...." There
follows a programme for maintaining contact.</P>
<p>
When the war broke out Kasparov was obliged to leave Germany
and move to Berne. He and Ilyich met like old friends. They saw
each other in Berne every day, and soon Kasparov became one of
the most intimate comrades of our group. That is how he came to be
elected to the Committee of Organizations Abroad.</P>
<P>The rallying of our forces on an international scale became the
order of the day. How difficult that task was was shown by the
London Conference of the Socialist parties of the Entente
countries (Britain, Belgium, France and Russia), which was held on
February 14, 1915. The conference was called by Vandervelde but
organized by the British Independent Labour Party headed by Keir
Hardie and MacDonald. Prior to the conference they had been
opposed to the war and stood for international unity. The
I.L.P. had first intended inviting delegates from Germany and
Austria, but the French had declared they would not attend the
conference if that were done. There were 11 delegates from
Britain, 16 from France, three from Belgium, and three
Socialist-Revolutionaries from Russia, and one delegate from the
Menshevik Organizing Committee. We were to be represented there by
Litvinov. It was obvious in advance what kind of conference it
would be, and what could be expected of it, and it was therefore
arranged that Litvinov would merely read the declaration of our
Central Committee. Ilyich drew up a rough draft of the declaration
for Litvinov. It put forward the demand that Vandervelde, Guesde
and Sembat should resign immediately from the bourgeois cabinets
of Belgium and France, and that all the Socialist parties should
support the Russian workers in their fight against tsarism. The
declaration stated that the Social-Democrats of Germany and
Austria had committed a monstrous crime against socialism and the
International by voting for war credits and concluding a "civil
peace" with the Junkers, the clergy and the bourgeoisie, but that
the Belgian and French Socialists had done no better. The workers
of Russia extended a comradely hand to the Socialists who acted
like Karl Liebknecht, like the Socialists of Serbia and Italy,
like the British comrades of the I.L.P. and some of the members of
the British Socialist Party, like our arrested comrades of the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.</P>
<p>
"This is the road we call you to take, the road of
socialism. Down with chauvinism, which is ruining the proletarian
cause! Long live international socialism!" These were the
concluding words of the declaration, which was signed by the
Central Committee and by the representative of the Lettish
Social-Democrats Berzins. The chairman did not give Litvinov a
chance to read the declaration to the end. Litvinov therefore
handed it over to the chairman and walked out declaring that the
R.S.D.L.P. was not participating in the conference. After
Litvinov's withdrawal, the conference adopted a resolution
supporting the "war of liberation" until victory over Germany was
achieved. Among those who voted for that resolution were Keir
Hardie and MacDonald.</P>
<p>
Meanwhile preparations were going forward for an
international women's conference. The important thing was not only
to have such a conference take place, but to avoid its assuming a
pacifist character, and have it take up a definite
revolutionary stand. A good deal of preliminary work was therefore
involved, the brunt of which was borne by Inessa. Assisting the
editors of the Central Organ in translating all kinds of
documents, and having been directly engaged in the struggle
against "defencism" from the very outset, she was admirably suited
for the job. Besides, she knew foreign languages, and corresponded
with Clara Zetkin, Balabanova, Kollontai and Englishwomen, thus
helping to strengthen the early threads of international
ties. Those threads were extremely weak and often broke, but
Inessa kept mending them again and again. She corresponded with
the French comrades through Stael, who lived in Paris. Contact
with Balabanova was easiest of all. She worked in Italy and took
part in the work of the <EM>Avanti.</EM> The revolutionary temper
of the Italian Socialist Party was at its highest pitch at that
time. Anti-defencist feeling was rising in Germany. On December 2
Liebknecht voted against war credits. Clara Zetkin convened the
International Women's Conference. She was the secretary of the
International Bureau of Socialist Women. Together with
K. Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg and F. Mehring she fought against
the chauvinist majority in the German Social-Democratic
Party. Inessa corresponded with her. As for Kollontai, she had
left the Mensheviks by that time. She wrote to Vladimir Ilyich and
me in January and sent us a leaflet. "My dear respected comrade,"
Ilyich wrote her in return. "Thank you very much for the leaflet
(the most I can do at present is to hand it over to the local
members of <EM>Rabotnitsa</EM> editorial board &#8211; they have already
sent a letter to Zetkin of apparently the same content as
yours)." Ilyich then goes on to clarify the position of
the Bolsheviks. "Apparently you do not entirely agree with
the civil war slogan, which you relegate, so to speak, to a minor
(I should even say to a conditional) place behind the slogan of
peace. And you underline that 'what we must put forward is a
slogan that would <EM>unite</EM> us all.' </P>
<P>"Frankly, what I fear most of all at the present time is just
this kind of indiscriminate unity, which, in my opinion, is most
dangerous and harmful to the proletariat." It was on the basis
of Ilyich's position that Inessa corresponded with Kollontai about
the conference. Kollontai was not able to attend it.</P>
<p>
The international conference at Berne was held on March
26-28. The largest and best organized delegation was the German,
headed by Clara Zetkin. The delegates of the Russian Central
Committee were Armand, Lilina, Ravich, Krupskaya and
Rozmirovich. The Polish "Rozlamowcy" were represented by Kamenska
(Domskaya), who kept together with the delegation of the Central
Committee. There were two more Russians representing the
Organizing Committee. Balabanova represented Italy. Louise
Simanot, a Frenchwoman, was strongly influenced by Balabanova. The
temper of the Dutch was sheerly pacifist. Roland-Holst, who then
belonged to the Left wing, could not come; there was a delegate
from the Troelstra Party, which was out-and-out chauvinist. The
English delegates belonged to the opportunist I.L.P., and the
Swiss delegates were pacifistically inclined. This tendency
predominated. In comparison with the London Conference six weeks
before, this one, of course, signified no little progress. The
fact that women Socialists of the belligerent countries had
gathered together at this conference was significance in
itself.</P>
<P>
Most of the German delegates belonged to the K. Liebknecht-Rosa
Luxemburg group. This group had begun to dissociate itself from
the chauvinists and fight its government. Rosa Luxemburg had
been arrested. This held good only for home use. On the
international rostrum, however, they thought they had to be as
conciliatory as possible, since they represented a country that
was winning battles at the fronts of the movement. If the
conference, convened with such difficulty, broke up, they would
be held responsible for it, and the chauvinists of all
countries, the German social-patriots first and foremost would
have exulted at its failure. Clara Zetkin, therefore, was
inclined to make concessions to the pacifists, and this meant
watering down the revolutionary essence of the resolution. Our
delegation &#8211; the delegation of the Central Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P. &#8211; supported the point of view of Ilyich as expressed
in his letter to Kollontai. It was a matter not of any kind of
unity, but unity for revolutionary struggle against chauvinism,
for the proletariat's uncompromising struggle against the ruling
classes. Chauvinism was not condemned in the resolution drawn up
by a committee consisting of German, English and Dutch
delegates. We submitted our own declaration. It was defended by
Inessa, and supported by Kamenska, the
representative of the Polish women. We were not supported by the conference. Everyone criticized our "splitting" policy. Events soon proved the correctness of our position, however. The tame pacifism of the English and the Dutch did not advance international action a single step. A greater role 
in hastening the end of the war was played by the revolutionary struggle and a clean break with the chauvinists.</P>
<p>
Ilyich tackled the task of rallying the forces for the
struggle on the international front with all the ardour of his
nature. "No matter that we are so few," he said once. "We shall
have millions with us." He drafted our resolution for the Berne
Women's Conference, too, and followed all its
proceedings. Obviously, it was very difficult for him to put up
with the role of a sort of shadow-leader in the momentous events
that were taking place around him and in which he longed with all
his being to take a direct part.</P>
<p>
One incident sticks in my memory. Inessa and I were visiting
Abram Skovno in the hospital (he had undergone an operation), when
Ilyich came along and urged Inessa to go and see Zetkin, and
persuade her of the correctness of our position. She would have to
see, she could not help seeing, he said, that sliding down into
pacifism at such a time was impossible. All the issues at stake
had to be emphasized very strongly. Ilyich cited argument after
argument that was to be used to convince Zetkin. Inessa was not
keen on going. She did not believe that anything would come of
it. Ilyich insisted and pleaded warmly. Nothing came of Inessa's
talk with Zetkin.</P>
<p>
Another international conference was held in Berne on April
17 &#8211; the Conference of Socialist Youth. A fairly large number of
young men from various belligerent countries, who refused to go to
the front and fight in the imperialist war, had gathered in
Switzerland at the time, to which they had emigrated as a neutral
country. These young men, it goes without saying, were
revolutionary minded. It was no accident that the International
Women's Conference was immediately followed by the Conference of
Socialist Youth.</P>
<p>
Inessa and Safarov spoke at the conference on behalf of the Central Committee of our Party.</P>
<p>
In March my mother died. She had been a close comrade, who had
helped in all our work. In Russia, during police raids, she would
hide all illegal materials. She took parcels and messages to
comrades in prison. She
had lived with us in Siberia and abroad, done the housekeeping, entertained the comrades who came to see us, made special vests with illegal literature sewn up in them, written the "skeletons" for invisible-ink letters, etc. The comrades loved her. The last winter had been a very bad one for her. Her strength was at very low ebb. She had been homesick, but had had no one in Russia to take care of her there. She often had arguments with Vladimir Ilyich, but had always been solicitous about him, and Vladimir, too, had been considerate towards her. Once Mother sat looking glum. She was an inveterate smoker and had forgotten to buy cigarettes; it was Sunday, and no tobacco was to be obtained anywhere. Seeing this, Ilyich said: "What a thing to worry about &#8211; I'11 get you some in a minute," and off he went to hunt up some cigarettes in the cafes. He found some and brought them home. Shortly before she died Mother said to me: "No, I won't go to Russia by myself. I'11 wait until you two go." On another occasion she began to talk about religion. She considered herself religious, but had not gone to church for years, had never kept the fast, never prayed, and, in general, religion played no part in her life, but she did not like to talk about it. And now she had broken her rule, saying: "I believed in God in my youth, but after having lived and learned life, I saw what nonsense the whole thing was." She had often expressed a desire to be cremated when she died. The little house in which we lived stood quite close to the Berne woods, and when the warm spring sun began to shine, she felt drawn to the woods. We went there together, and sat on a bench for about half an hour; she barely managed to walk back, and the next day her death agony started. We did as she had asked &#8211; cremated her body at the Berne Crematorium.</P>
<P>Vladimir Ilyich and I sat waiting in the cemetery, and in about
two hours an attendant brought us a tin can with the ashes still
warm in it, and showed us where to bury it.</P>
<p>
Family life became more student-like than ever. Our landlady,
a devout old woman who worked as a presser, asked us to look for
other lodgings as she wanted to let our room to religious-minded
people. We moved to another room.</P>
<p>
The trial of the five Duma deputies took place on February
10. All five Bolshevik deputies &#8211; Petrovsky, Muranov, Badayev,
Samoilov and Shagov, together with L. B. Kamenev were sentenced to
deportation.</P>
<p>
In his article "What the Trial of the R.S.D.L.P. Group Has
Proved," written on March 29, 1915, Vladimir Ilyich stated: "The
facts show that in the very first months following the outbreak of
the war, the class-conscious vanguard of the workers in Russia
rallied <EM>in deed</EM> around the Central Committee and the
Central Organ. However unpalatable this fact may be to certain
'groups,' it is incontrovertible. The words cited in the
indictment:'The guns should be turned not against our brothers,
the wage slaves of other countries, but against the reactionary
and bourgeois governments and parties of all countries' &#8211; these
words, thanks to the trial, will spread and have already spread
throughout Russia an appeal to proletarian internationalism, to
proletarian revolution. The class slogan of the vanguard of the
workers of Russia has now reached the broadest masses thanks to
the trial.</P>
<p>
"Widespread chauvinism among the bourgeoisie and part of the
petty bourgeoisie, vacillations in the other Part, and such an
appeal of the working class &#8211; such is the actual objective picture
of our political divisions. It is to this actual picture, and not
to the good wishes of the intellectuals and founders of small
groups that one must adjust one's 'prospects,' hopes and
slogans.</P>
<p>
The <EM>Pravda</EM>-ist newspapers and work of the 'Muranov
type' have created unity among four-fifths of Russia's
class-conscious workers. About forty thousand workers bought
<EM>Pravda,</EM> and many more read it. Even if war, prison,
Siberia and penal servitude break five times more of them, ten
times more &#8211; this stratum <EM>can never</EM> be destroyed. It is
alive. It is imbued with the revolutionary spirit and
anti-chauvinism. It <EM>alone</EM> stands among the masses of the
people, in the very thick of them, as the spokesman of
internationalism of the toiling, the exploited and the
oppressed. It<EM> alone</EM> has stood its ground amid the general
ruin. It alone leads the semi-proletarian strata <EM>away
from</EM> the social-chauvinism of the Cadets, Trudoviks,
Plekhanov and <EM>Nasha Zarya</EM> to socialism. Its existence,
its ideas, its activities, its appeal to the 'brotherhood of wage
slaves of other countries' have been revealed to the whole of
Russia by the trial of the R.S.D.L.P. group.</P>
<p>
"It is with this section that we must work. It is its unity
that we must defend against the social-chauvinists, It is along
this road alone that the working-class movement in Russia can
develop towards social revolution and not towards national
liberalism of the 'European' type." </P>
<p>
Events soon proved that Lenin was right. He worked
indefatigably to disseminate the ideas of internationalism, to
expose social-chauvinism in all its varied forms.</P>
<p>
After my mother's death I had a relapse of my old complaint
and was ordered by the doctors to take the mountain air. Ilyich
found through the advertisements a cheap boarding-house in a
non-fashionable locality at the foot of the Rothorn in
Sorenberg. We lived there in the Hotel Marienthal all through the
summer.</P>
<p>
Shortly before our departure the "Japanese" (Bosch and
Pyatakov) arrived in Berne with a scheme for establishing abroad
an illegal magazine in which all the most important questions
could be comprehensively dealt with. The <EM>Communist</EM> was to
be published under the auspices of the Central Organ, with P. and
N. Kievsky (Bosch and Pyatakov) as associate editors. This
arrangement was agreed upon. During the summer Ilyich wrote a
comprehensive article for the <EM>Communist</EM> "The Collapse of
the Second International," and in cooperation with Zinoviev he
wrote, in preparation for the conference of internationalists, a
pamphlet entitled <EM>Socialism and War.</EM></P>
<p>
We fixed up nicely in Sorenberg. All around there were woods
and mountains, with even snow on the summit of Rothorn. The mail
was delivered with Swiss punctuality. We found that even in such
an out-of-the-way village as Sorenberg one could obtain any book
one needed from the Berne or Zurich libraries free of charge. All
you had to do was to send a post card to the library giving your
address and the book you wanted. No questions were asked, no
certificates or guarantees were demanded. Such a contrast to
bureaucratic France! Two days later the book arrived in a
cardboard wrapper with a tab tied to it with string, on one side
of which was the address of the reader, on the other the address
of the library that had sent it. This enabled Ilyich to work even
in such an out of-the-way place. Ilyich was lavish of praise for
Swiss culture. He found he could work very well in
Sorenberg. After a while Inessa came to stay with us. We would get
up early, and before dinner, which was served throughout
Switzerland at 12 o'clock, each of us would work in different
nooks of the garden. Inessa often played the piano during those
hours, and it was very pleasant to work to the sounds of music
drifting down into the garden. In the afternoon we used to go for
walks in the mountains sometimes for the rest of the day. Ilyich
loved the mountains &#8211; he liked to climb the spurs of Rothorn
towards the evening, when one got a beautiful view from the
heights with the rose-tinted mist curling below, or to roam about
the Schrattenfluh (a mountain about two kilometres from us) which
we translated as "accursed steps."'It was covered with a sort of
corroded rock worn away by the spring streams, and it was
impossible to climb to its broad flat summit. We seldom climbed
the Rothorn, although it commanded a lovely view of the Alps. We
went to bed at cockcrow, coming home with armfuls of alpine roses
and berries; we were all passionate mushroomers &#8211; there were edible
mushrooms galore, but lots of other fungus growth too, and we used
to argue fiercely over the different kinds and names as if it
were a resolution on some vital issue.</P>
<p>
The struggle in Germany was beginning to rise. The
<EM>International,</EM> a magazine founded by Rosa Luxemburg and
Franz Mehring, appeared in April and was immediately suppressed. A
pamphlet by Junius (Rosa Luxemburg) <EM>The Crisis of German
Social-Democracy</EM> was published. An appeal of the German Left
Social-Democrats written by Karl Liebknecht entitled "The Chief
Enemy Is in Your Own Country" was issued, and at the beginning of
June K. Liebknecht and Duncker drew up "An Open Letter to the
Central Committee of the Social-Democratic Party and the Reichstag
Faction" protesting against the attitude of the Social-Democratic
majority towards the war. This "Open Letter" was signed by a
thousand party functionaries.</P>
<p>
In face of the growing influence of the Left
Social-Democrats, the Central Committee of the German
Social-Democratic Party decided on a countermove. On the one
hand it issued a manifesto over the signatures of Kautsky, Haase
and Bernstein against annexations and calling for party unity, and
on the other it came out against the Left opposition in its own
name and in the name of the Reichstag faction.</P>
<p>
In Switzerland Robert Grimm called a preliminary conference
for July 11 at Berne to discuss the preparations for the
international conference of Left-wingers. The meeting was
attended by seven persons &#8211; Grimm, Zinoviev, P. B. Axelrod,
Warski, Valetsky, Balabanova and Morgari. As a matter of fact,
apart from Zinoviev, there were no real Left-wingers at that
preliminary conference, and one could gather from the drift of
their talk that non of its participants was seriously interested
in convening a conference of the Lefts.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich was worried, and sent letters out in all
directions &#8211; to Zinoviev, Radek, Berzins, Kollontai and the
Lausanne comrades &#8211; to make sure that places were secured for
genuine Lefts at the forthcoming conference, and to ensure the
greatest possible unity among them. By the middle of August the
Bolsheviks had drawn up: 1) a manifesto; 2) draft resolutions; 3)
a draft declaration, which were forwarded to comrades of the
extreme Left for consideration. By October Lenin's and Zinoviev's
pamphlet <EM>Socialism and War</EM> had been translated into
German.</P>
<p>
The conference was held in Zimmerwald on September
5-8. Delegates were there from eleven countries (thirty-eight
delegates in all). What was known as the Zimmerwald Left group
consisted of only nine people (Lenin, Zinoviev, Berzins, Hoglund,
Nerman, Radek, Borchardt and Platten; after the conference
Roland-Holst joined them). Other Russian delegates at the
conference were Trotsky, Axelrod, Martov, Natanson, Chernov and a
Bundist. Trotsky did not join the Left Zimmerwaldists.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich left for the conference before it was due to
open, and at a private meeting on the 4th made a report on the
character of the war and the tactics to be applied by the
international conference. The dispute centred around the
question of the manifesto. The Lefts submitted their draft
manifesto and resolution on the war and the tasks of the
Social-Democrats. The majority rejected the draft of the Lefts and
adopted a much vaguer and less militant manifesto. The Lefts
signed the general manifesto. The following appraisal of the
Zimmerwald Conference was given by Vladimir Ilyich in his article
"The First Step": "Should our Central Commit tee have signed a
manifesto that suffered from inconsistency and timidity? We think
we should. Our disagreement, the disagreement not only of our
Central Committee but Of the whole Left, <EM>international,
revolutionary-Marxist</EM> part of the conference is openly
expressed in a special resolution, and in a special draft
manifesto, and in a special declaration on the motives of voting
for a compromise manifesto. We did not conceal one iota of our
views, slogans and tactics. The German edition of our pamphlet
<EM>Socialism and War</EM> was distributed at the conference. We
have promulgated, are promulgating and shall promulgate our views
to no less an extent than the manifesto will be promulgated. That
this manifesto is a <EM>step forward</EM> towards a real struggle
against opportunism, towards breaking and splitting with it, is a
fact. It would be sectarianism to refuse to take this step
<EM>together</EM> with the German, French, Swedish, Norwegian and
Swiss minority, when we retain complete freedom and the full
possibility to criticize inconsistency and achieve something
greater." </P>
<p>
At the Zimmerwald Conference the Lefts organized a bureau of
their own and in general formed a distinct group.</P>
<p>
Although Ilyich had written before the Zimmerwald Conference
that the Kautskyites ought to have had our draft resolution
presented to them: "The Dutch plus ourselves plus the Left Germans
plus nought &#8211; that does not matter, it will not be Nought
afterwards, but All," the rate of progress was nevertheless very
slow indeed, and Ilyich could not reconcile himself to it. In
fact, his article "The First Step" begins by emphasizing the slow
rate of development of the revolutionary movement. "The
development of the international socialist movement is making slow
progress in the epoch of extremely acute crisis caused by the
war." It was therefore in a pretty irritable frame of mind that
Ilyich returned from the Zimmerwald Conference.</P>
<p>
The day after Ilyich's return we climbed the Rothorn. We
climbed with "glorious zest," but when we got to the top Ilyich
suddenly lay down on the ground in a rather uncomfortable
position, and fell asleep almost right in
the snow. Clouds gathered, then broke, and a wonderful view of the Alps opened before us, but Ilyich slept like the dead, without stirring. He slept for over an hour. Zimmerwald must have taken it out of him pretty badly.</P>
<p>
It took several days rambling about the mountains and the
general bracing atmosphere of Sorenberg to bring Ilyich round
again. Kollontai was going to America, and Ilyich wrote urging her
to do all she could in the way of rallying the American Left-wing
internationalist elements. Early in October we returned to
Berne. Ilyich went to Geneva to report back on the Zimmerwald
Conference, and continued his correspondence with Kollontai about
the Americans, etc.</P>
<p>
The autumn was rather hot and close. Berne is chiefly an
administrative and academic centre. It has many good libraries,
and lots of scholars, but life there is soaked in a sort of
petty-bourgeois dullness. Berne is very "democratic" &#8211; the wife of
the Republic's highest official shakes her rugs out on the balcony
every day, but the life of the women in Berne is wholly submerged
in these rugs and the domestic comforts they stand for. We rented
a room with electric lighting in the autumn, and moved our
portmanteau and our books over. That same day the Shklovskys
dropped in, and I began showing off the electric lights to
them. When they had gone the landlady came bouncing in and
demanded that we move out the very next day &#8211; she would not put up
with anybody turning on the electricity in the daytime in her
house. We decided that she was not all there, and took a room in a
different place, a more humble place without electricity. This
petty-bourgeois stamp lay upon everything in Switzerland. A
Russian theatrical company, playing in German, once visited
Berne. They showed L. Tolstoi's <EM>The Living Corpse.</EM> We
went to see the play. The acting was fine. Ilyich, who heartily
detested every kind of philistinism and conventionality, was
greatly stirred by the play. He wanted to go and see it again
afterwards. The Russians liked it
very much. So did the Swiss. But to them the play appealed in quite a different way. They were terribly sorry for Protasov's wife, and took her troubles to heart. "What a good for-nothing husband she went and married. Mind you, they were rich people of high standing, and could have lived so happily. Poor Liza!"</P>
<p>
The autumn of 1915 found us busier than ever in the libraries
and taking our usual walks, but nothing could shake off this
feeling of being cooped up in a petty-bourgeois democratic
cage. Out there the revolutionary struggle was mounting, life was
seething, but it was all so far away.</P>
<p>
Very little could be done in Berne by way Of establishing
direct contacts with the Lefts. I remember Inessa making a trip
to French Switzerland to get in touch with the Swiss Lefts, Naine
and Graber. Try as she might, she could not get to see them. They
always had some excuse. Either Naine was out fishing, or Graber
was busy with domestic affairs. "Father is busy today, it's our
washing-day, and he's hanging out the washing," Graber's little
daughter informed Inessa politely. Fishing and hanging out the
washing are all very well in their way &#8211; Ilyich often stood guard
over a pan of milk to see that it did not run over &#8211; but when the
fishing-rod and the washing stood in the way of an important
discussion about organizing the Lefts, then there was something
wrong about it. Inessa got a passport in somebody else's
name and went to Paris. On their return from Zimmerwald, Merrheim
and Bourderon had set up in Paris a Committee for Restoring
International Contacts. Inessa represented the Bolsheviks on
it. She had to fight hard there for the Left line, which won the
day in the long run. Inessa gave Ilyich a full account of her
work in her letters.</P>
<p>
"Dear Vladimir Ilvich," she wrote in a post card on January
25, 1916. "Thank you for your letter &#8211; it calmed me and cheered me
up. As it happened I was upset that day over my failure with
Merrheim. After reading what
you say about Trotsky's refusal to contribute to the Dutch magazine, I am better able to account for Merrheim's refusal to take part in it &#8211; obviously there is a connection between the two. Your letter could not have been more to the point for another reason &#8211; in that it has now definitely strengthened the point of view I had formed as to the character of the work, but over which I had slightly wavered. On the whole, am living well here, although I find it very tiring. Today, Tor instance, I waited for four hours to see somebody. But then I succeeded at last in getting a ticket to the national library, and a lot of information besides on how to use the catalogues and find what I wanted there. Well, I wish you the best. Sincerely yours."</P>
<p>
Simultaneously with this letter Inessa sent a full account of
her further activities, concealed in the covers of a book. This is
what she wrote:</P>
<p>
"Dear friends, I am writing just a few lines as I have very
little time. Since last writing you, there have been two meetings
of the Committee of Action. At one of them we discussed the appeal
(about the 'minority,' of the French Party joining the German
'minority' and not the 'majority,' about the re-establishment of
the International).Trotsky's draft was rejected and Merrheim's
adopted instead, in which nothing is said about re-establishment,
but merely that 'the International should be based on the class
struggle, on the struggle against imperialism, on the struggle for
peace. We support that kind of International.' Then it goes on to
say that an International which would not be based on these
foundations would be a deceit of the proletariat. I proposed
several amendments &#8211; about the struggle against the
social-chauvinists (I was told it would be inserted at the end),
about the International fighting against imperialism (this was
accepted), and finally I opposed that 'we support that kind of
International,' and proposed the wording 'we shall reorganize the
International on the basis, etc.' Merrheim
and Bourderon let go at me for this 'reorganizing.' Merrheim said that we are Guesdists (old methods), that we think in the abstract, that we do not reckon with circumstances, that the Socialists in France will not hear of a split, and so on. I told him that an old-type Guesdist was not such a bad thing, that our present tactics were real and vital, as we could only rally the forces of the proletariat behind us by clearly and definitely opposing our point of view to that of the chauvinists; that the leaders' betrayal has evoked mistrust and disappointment; that many workers at the factories, on reading our pamphlet, said: 'This is very good, but there are no more Socialists'; that we must carry into the masses the good tidings
that there <EM>are</EM> Socialists, that we can do it only by making a clean break with the chauvinists."</P>
<p>
Inessa goes on to write about the work with the youth, the
plan for publishing leaflets, about contacts with the mechanics,
tailors, navvies and other sections of the syndicalists,
etc. She did a great deal of work in our Paris group, and had
met Sapozhkov, a member of the group, who had started by going
to the front as a volunteer and who now shared the views of the
Bolsheviks and had begun to conduct propaganda among the French
soldiers.</P>
<p>
Shklovsky organized a small chemical laboratory, and our
people (Kasparov, Zinoviev) worked there for a
livelihood. Zinoviev gazed with a pensive eye at the various tubes
and retorts that had made their appearance in everyones
rooms.</P>

The work that could be done in Berne was mostly
theoretical. Many things had become clearer during the
war. Characteristic in this respect was the question of a United
States of Europe. The Declaration of the Central Committee,
published in the Central Organ on November 1, 1914, said:</P>
<p>
"The immediate political slogan of the Social-Democrats of
Europe must be the formation of a republican United States of
Europe, but in contrast to the bourgeoisie, which is ready to
'promise' anything in order to draw the proletariat into the
general current of chauvinism, the Social-Democrats will explain
that this slogan is utterly false and senseless without the
revolutionary overthrow of the German, Austrian and Russian
monarchies." </P>
<p>
During the conference of the sections abroad held in March
this slogan was hotly debated. The report of the conference
stated: "... On the question of the slogan of a 'United States of
Europe' the discussion took a one-sided political character, and
it was decided to postpone the question until it had been dealt
with on the Economic side in the press." </P>
<p>
The question of imperialism, its economic essence, the
exploitation of the weaker states by the powerful capitalist
states, and the exploitation of the colonies, loomed large. The
Central Organ, therefore, came to the conclusion that:</P>
<p>
"From the standpoint of the economic conditions of
imperialism, i.e., export of capital and the fact that the world
has been divided up among the 'advanced' and 'civilized' colonial
powers &#8211; a United States of Europe, under capitalism, is either
impossible or reactionary.... A United States of Europe under
capitalism is tantamount to an agreement to divide up the
colonies." </P>
<p>
But perhaps it was possible to put forward another slogan,
the slogan of a United States of the World? Here is what Ilyich
wrote in this connection:</P>
<p>
"A United States of the World (not of Europe alone) is the
state form of the union and freedom of nations which we associate
with socialism &#8211; until the complete victory of communism brings
about the total disappearance of the state, including the
democratic state. As a separate slogan, however, the slogan of a
United States of the World would hardly be a correct one, first,
because it merges with socialism; second, because it may be
wrongly
interpreted to mean that the victory of socialism in a single country is impossible, and it may also create misconceptions as to the relations of such a country to the others."</P>
<p>
This article is a good illustration of Ilyich's train of
thought at the end of 1915. Clearly, it took the line of deeper
study of the economic roots of the world war, i.e., of
imperialism, on the one hand, and that of ascertaining the ways
which the world struggle for socialism would follow, on the
other.</P>
<p>
It was on these problems that Vladimir Ilyich worked at the
end of 1915 and in 1916, when he collected material for his
pamphlet <EM>Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism,</EM>
and read Marx and Engels over and over again in order to obtain a
clearer idea of the epoch of socialist revolution, its ways and
its development.</P>
