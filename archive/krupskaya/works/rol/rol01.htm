<p>
Vladimir Ilyich came to St. Petersburg in the autumn of 1893,
but I did not get to know him until some time later. Comrades
told me that a very erudite Marxist had arrived from the
Volga. Afterwards I was given a pretty well-thumbed copy-book "On
Markets" to read. The manuscript set forth the views of
technologist Herman Krasin,
our St. Petersburg Marxist, on the one hand, and those of the newcomer from the Volga on the other. The copy-book was folded down the middle, and on one side H. B. Krasin had set forth his views in a scrawly hand with many crossings out and insertions, while on the other side the newcomer had written his own remarks and objections in a neat hand without any alterations.</P>
<p>
The question of markets interested all of us young Marxists very much at the time.</P>
<p>
A definite trend had begun to crystallize among
St. Petersburg Marxist study-circles at that time. The gist
of it was this: the processes of social development appeared to
the representatives of this trend as something mechanical and
schematic. Such an interpretation of social development
dismissed completely the role of the masses, the role of the
proletariat. Marxism was stripped of its revolutionary dialectics,
and only the bare "phases of development" remained. Today, of
course, any Marxist would be able to refute that mechanistic
conception, but at that time it was a cause of grave concern to
our St. Petersburg Marxist circles. We were still poorly grounded
theoretically and all that many of us knew of Marx was the first
volume of <EM>Capital</EM>; as for <EM>The Communist
Manifesto</EM>, we had never even set eyes on it. So it was more
by instinct than anything else that we felt this mechanistic view
to be the direct opposite of real Marxism.</P>
<p>
The question of markets had a close bearing on the general
question of the understanding of Marxism.</P>
<p>
Exponents of the mechanistic view usually approached the question in a very abstract way.</P>
<p>
Since then more than thirty years have passed. Unfortunately,
the copy-book has not survived, and I can only speak about the
impression which it made on us.</P>
<p>
The question of markets was treated with ultra-concreteness by
our new Marxist friend. He linked it up with the interests of the
masses, and in his whole approach once sensed just that live
Marxism which takes phenomena in their concrete surroundings and
in their development. </P>
<P>
One wanted to make the closer acquaintance of this newcomer, to learn his views at first hand.</P>
<p>
I did not meet Vladimir Ilyich until Shrovetide. It was
decided to arrange a conference between certain St. Petersburg
Marxists and the man from the Volga at the flat of engineer
Klasson, a prominent St. Petersburg Marxist with whom I had
attended the same study-circle two years before. The conference
was disguised as a pancake party. Besides Vladimir Ilyich, there
were Klasson, Y. P. Korobko, Serebrovsky, S. I. Radchenko and
others. Potresov and Struve were to have been there, too, but I
don't think they turned up. I particularly remember one
moment. The question came up as to what ways we should
take. Somehow general agreement was lacking. Someone (I believe It
was Shevlyagin) said that work on the Illiteracy Committee was of
great importance Vladimir Ilyich laughed, and his laughter sounded
rather harsh (I never heard him laugh that way again).</P>
<p>
"Well, if anyone wants to save the country by working In the
Illiteracy Committee," he said, "let him go ahead." It should be
said that our generation had witnessed in its youth the fight
between the Narodovoltsi and tsarism. We had seen how the
liberals, at first "sympathetic" about everything, had been scared
into sticking their tail between their legs after the suppression
of the Narodnaya Volya Party, and had begun to preach the doing of
"little things."</P>
<p>
Lenin's sarcastic remark was quite understandable. He had come
to discuss ways of fighting together, and had had to listen
instead to an appeal for the distribution or the Illiteracy
Committee's pamphlets.</P>
<p>
Later, when we got to know each other better, Vladimir Ilyich
told me one day how this liberal "society" had reacted to the
arrest of his elder brother Alexander Ulyanov. All acquaintances
had shunned the Ulyanov family, and even an old teacher, who until
then had come almost
every evening to play chess, had left off calling. Simbirsk had no railway at the time, and Vladimir Ilyich's mother had had to travel to Syzran by horse-drawn vehicle in order to catch the train to St. Petersburg, where her son was imprisoned. Vladimir Ilyich was sent to find a way companion for her, but no one wanted to be seen with the mother of an arrested man.</P>
<p>
This general cowardice, Vladimir Ilyich told me, had shocked him profoundly at the time.</P>
<p>
This youthful experience undoubtedly affected his attitude
towards so-called liberal society. He true worth of all liberal
rant at an early age.</P>
<p>
No agreement was reached at the "pancake party," of
course. Vladimir Ilyich spoke little, and was more occupied in
studying the company. People who called themselves Marxists felt
uncomfortable under his steady gaze.</P>
<p>
I remember, as we were returning home from the Okhta District
along the banks of the Neva, I first heard the story of Vladimir
Ilyich's brother, a member of the Narodnaya Volya, who took part
in the attempt on the life of Alexander III in 1887 and died at
the hands of the tsarist executioners before he had even came of
age.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich had been very fond of his brother. They had
had many tastes in common, and both liked to be left alone for
long periods of time to be able to concentrate. They usually lived
together and at one time shared a separate wing of the house, and
when any of the young crowd dropped in (they had numerous cousins,
boys and girls), the brothers would greet them with their
pet phrase: "Honour us with your absence." They were both hard
workers and revolutionary-minded. The difference in their age,
though, made itself felt in various ways. There were certain
things that Alexander did not tell Vladimir. This is what Vladimir
Ilyich told me:</P>
<p>
His brother was a naturalist. On his last summer vacation at
home he was preparing a dissertation on the <EM>Annelida</EM>, and
was busy all the time with his microscope. To get all the light he
could he got up at daybreak and started work at once. "No, my
brother won't make a revolutionary,
I thought at the time," Vladimir Ilyich related. "A revolutionary can't give so much time to the study of worms. It was not long before he saw his mistake.</P>
<p>
The fate of his brother undoubtedly influenced Vladimir Ilyich
profoundly. Another important factor was that he had begun to
think for himself on many questions and had decided in his own
mind the necessity of revolutionary
struggle.</P>
<p>
Had this not been so, his brother's fate would probably have
caused him deep sorrow only, or at most, aroused in him a resolve
and striving to follow in his brother's footsteps. As it was, the
fate of his brother gave his mind a keener edge, developed in him
an extraordinary soberness
of thought, an ability to face the truth without letting himself
for a minute be carried away by a phrase or an illusion. It
developed in him a scrupulously honest approach to all
questions. </P>   <P>In
the autumn of 1894 Vladimir Ilyich read his <EM>The "Friends of
the People"</EM> to our circle. I remember how it had thrilled
us all. The aims of the struggle were set forth in the pamphlet
with admirable clarity. Hectographed copies of it circulated
afterwards from hand to hand under the name of "The Yellow
Copy-Books." They were unsigned. Fairly widely read, they
undoubtedly had a strong influence on the Marxist youth at the
time. When I was in Poltava in 1896, P. P. Rumyantsev, who was
then an active Social-Democrat just released from prison,
described <EM>The "Friends of the People"</EM> as the best, the
most powerful and complete formulation of the standpoint of the
revolutionary Social-Democracy.</P>
<p>
In the winter of 1894-95 I got more closely acquainted with
Vladimir Ilyich. He was lecturing to workers' study-
circles in the Nevskaya Zastava District, where I had been working for over three years as a teacher in the Smolenskaya Sunday Evening School for Adults and was therefore pretty familiar with life on the Schlusselburg Post Road. Quite a number of the workers who attended Vladimir Ilyich's circles were pupils of my Sunday School, among them Babushkin, Borovkov, Gribakin, the Bodrovs (Arseny and Philip) and Zhukov. In those days the Sunday Evening School offered an excellent opportunity for studying everyday working-class life, labour conditions and the temper of the masses. The Smolenskaya School had six hundred pupils, not counting the evening technical classes and the Women's and Obukhov schools attached to it. The workers, I must say, had full trust in their "school-mistresses." The dour-looking watchman of the Gromov timber-yards, for instance, told his teacher with a beaming face that a son had been born to him; a consumptive mill worker wished his teacher a bonny fiance for having taught him to read and write; another workman, a member of a religious sect, who had been seeking God all his life, wrote with satisfaction that not until last Holy Week had he learned from Rudakov (another pupil) that there wasn't any God at all, and this made him feel so good, because the worst thing in the world, was being a slave of God &#8211; you just had to grin and bear it-whereas being a slave of man was much easier &#8211; at least you could fight back; then there was a tobacco-worker, who used to get dead-drunk every Sunday and was so saturated with the smell of tobacco that it made you dizzy to stand near him. He wrote in a scrawl (leaving out most of the vowels) that they had picked up a girl of three in the street; she was living in their artel, but they would have to give her up to the police, which was a shame. A one-legged soldier came saying that "Mikhail &#8211; the chap you taught last year &#8211; has gone and done himself in with overwork, and before he died he asked to be remembered to you and to wish you long life." A textile worker, who stood up fiercely for the tsar and the priests, gave warning "to beware of that dark chap over there &#8211; he's always hanging about Gorokhovaya Street." An elderly workman argued that he just could not chuck up his churchwarden's job "because it makes me sick to see the way the priests are fooling the people, and somebody's got to show them up." As for the church, he wasn't struck on it a bit, and he'd cottoned to that phases-of-development stuff perfectly well, and so on and so forth.</P>
<p>
Workers who belonged to the organization went to the school to
get to know people and single out those who could be drawn into
the circles and the organization. As far as these workers were
concerned the teachers were no longer just a featureless set of
women. They were already able to distinguish the extent to which
this or that teacher was politically well-grounded. if they
recognized a schoolteacher to be "one of us" they let her know it
by some phrase or word. For instance, in discussing the handicraft
industry a man would say: "A handicraft worker cannot compete with
large-scale production," or else he would ask a poser, like "What
is the difference between a St. Petersburg worker and an
Arkhangelsk peasant?" And after that he would have a special look
for that teacher and would greet her in a special way, as much as
to say, "You're one of us, we know."</P>
<p>
If anything was doing locally they immediately told the
teacher about it, knowing that it would be passed on to the
organization. It was a sort of tacit understanding.</P>
<p>
As a matter of fact we could talk almost about anything at
school, although there was hardly a class that did not have a
police spy in it. If only you avoided such dreadful words as
"tsar," "strike," and so on, you could touch on fundamental
issues. Officially, of course, we were forbidden to talk about
anything whatever. One day the Recapitulation Group was shut down
because an inspector, on a surprise visit, had discovered that
decimals were being taught there whereas the syllabus only allowed
for the four rules of arithmetic.</P>
<p>
I lived in Staro-Nevsky Street at the time, in a building
that had a through courtyard, and Vladimir Ilyich used to drop in
on Sundays after his circle work, when we would start endless
conversations. I was in love with my school work and could talk
about it for hours if you did not stop me &#8211; talk about the school,
the pupils, the Semyannikov, Thornton, Maxwell and other factories
and mills in the neighbourhood. Vladimir Ilyich was interested in
every little detail that could help him to piece together a
picture of the life and conditions of the workers, to find some
sort of avenue of approach to them in the matter of revolutionary
propaganda. Most of the intellectuals those days did not know the
workers well. An intellectual would come to one of the
study-circles and read the workers a kind of lecture. A manuscript
translation of Engels'<EM> The Origin of the Family, Private
Property and the State</EM> circulated among the circles for a
long time. Vladimir Ilyich read Marx's <EM>Capital</EM> to the
workers and explained it to them. He devoted the second half of
the lesson to questioning the workers about their work and
conditions of labour, showing them the bearing which their life
had on the whole structure of society, and telling them in what
way the existing order could be changed. This linking of theory
with practice was a feature of Vladimir Ilyich's work in the
study-circles. Gradually other members of our circle adopted the
same method.</P>
<p>
When the hectographed Vilna pamphlet <EM>On Agitation</EM>
appeared the following year, the soil had been fully prepared for
agitation by leaflets. The thing was to make a start. The method
of agitation based on the workers' everyday needs struck deep root
in our Party work. I did not fully appreciate how efficacious this
method was until years later, when, living In France as a
political emigrant, I observed how, during the great strike of the
postal workers in Paris, the French Socialist Party stood
completely aloof from it. It was the business of the trade unions,
they said. In their opinion the business of a party was only
political struggle. They had no clear idea whatever about the
necessity of combining the economic with the political
struggle.</P>
<p>
Many of the comrades who worked in St. Petersburg at the time,
seeing the effect this leaflet agitation had, were so carried away
by the work that they entirely forgot that this was one of the
forms, but not the only form of work among the masses, and took
the path of notorious "Economism."</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich never forgot that there were other forms of
work. In 1895 he wrote the pamphlet <EM>An Explanation of the Law
Concerning Fines Levied on the Workers in the Factories,</EM> in
which he set a brilliant example of how to approach the average
worker of that time, and, proceeding from the workers' needs, to
lead them step by step to the question of the necessity of
political struggle. Many intellectuals thought the pamphlet dull
and prolix, but the workers read it avidly, for it was something
clear and familiar to them. (It was printed at the Narodnaya Volya
printing plant and distributed among the workers.) At that time Vladimir Ilyich had made a thorough study of factory legislation. He believed that explaining these laws to the workers made it much easier to show them the connection that existed between their position and the political regime. Evidences of this study are traceable in quite a number of articles and pamphlets which Ilyich wrote at the time for workers, notably in the pamphlet <EM>The New Factory Act</EM>, and the articles "On Strikes," "On Industrial Courts" and others.</P>
<P>
A result of this going about round the workers' circles was that
the police kept a close watch on us. Of all our group Vladimir
Ilyich was the most experienced in secrecy methods of work. He
knew the through yards, and was a master hand at giving sleuths
the slip. He taught us how to use invisible ink and to write
messages in books by a dotted code and secret ciphers, and
invented all kinds of aliases. One felt that he had been
well-schooled in Narodnaya Volya methods. Indeed, he had good
reason to speak with the great respect he did for the old
Narodovolets Mikhailov, nicknamed "Dvornik" (Janitor) on account
of his first-rate secrecy technique. Meanwhile, police
surveillance kept growing stricter, and Vladimir Ilyich insisted
that a "successor" should be appointed, someone who was not
being shadowed and who would take over all contacts. As I was
the "cleanest" of them in the eyes of the police, it was decided
to appoint me "successor." On Easter Sunday five or six of us
went to Tsarskoye Selo to "celebrate the holiday" with Silvin, a
member of our group, who lived there as a coach. In the train
going down we pretended not to know each other. We sat nearly
all discussing which contacts had to be kept going. Vladimir
Ilyich taught us the use of cipher, and we coded almost half a
book. Afterwards I am sorry to say, I was unable to decipher
this first attempt at collective coding. There was one
consolation, though &#8211; by the time it had to be deciphered most of
the "contacts" no longer existed.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich carefully built up these "contacts" by
searching everywhere for people who were likely, in one way or
another, to be of use in revolutionary work. I remember a
conference that was held on Vladimir Ilyich's initiative between
representatives of our group (Vladimir Ilyich and Krzhizhanovsky,
if I am not mistaken) and a group of women teachers of the Sunday
School. Nearly all of them afterwards became
Social-Democrats. Among them was Lydia Knipovich, an old member of
the Narodnaya Volya, who afterwards joined the
Social-Democrats. Old Party workers remember her. A woman of great
revolutionary self-discipline, exacting both to herself and
others, a splendid comrade, an excellent judge of people, who
surrounded those she worked with with love and solicitude, Lydia
was quick to appreciate the revolutionary in Vladimir Ilyich.</P>
<p>
Lydia undertook to handle all contacts with the Narodnaya
Volya printing plant. She made all the arrangements for printing,
passed over the MSS, took delivery of the printed pamphlets,
carried them round to her friends in baskets, and organized the
distribution of the literature among the workers. When she was
arrested &#8211; betrayed by a compositor at the plant &#8211; twelve baskets
with illegal pamphlets were confiscated from various friends of
hers. The Narodovoltsi printed mass editions of pamphlets for the
workers at the time, such as The Working Day, Lives and Interests,
Vladimir Ilyich's pamphlet On Fines, King Hunger, etc. Two of the
Narodovoltsi-Shapovalov and Ratanskaya &#8211; who worked at the
Lakhtinsky print-shop, are now in the ranks of the Communist
Party. Lydia Knipovich is no longer among the living. She died in
1920, when the Crimea, where she had been living for the last few
years, was under the Whites. On her death-bed her soul yearned
towards the Communists and she died with the name of the Communist
Party on her lips.</P>
<p>
Among the other participants of the conference were, I belive,
the school-teachers P. F. Kudeli and A. I. Mesheheryakova (both
at present members of the Party). One of the Nevskaya Zastava
teachers was Alexandra Kalmykova &#8211; an excellent lecturer (I
remember her lecture for workers on the state budget). She kept a
bookstore in Liteiny St. Vladimir Ilyich became closely acquainted
with her at the time. Struve was one of her pupils, and Potresov,
an old school-mate of Struve's, was a frequent visitor at her
place. Later Alexandra Kalmykova financed the old <EM>Iskra </EM>
right up to the time of the Second Congress. She did not join
Struve when he went over to the liberals, but definitely
associated herself with the<EM> Iskra</EM>ist organization. Her
sobriquet was Auntie. She was very friendly with Vladimir
Ilyich. Now she is dead, alter having been bedridden for two years
in a nursing home at Detskoye Selo. The children of the local
orphanages used to visit her occasionally, and she told them about
Ilyich. She had written to me in the spring of 1924 saying that
Vladimir Ilyich's 1917 articles containing ardent appeals which
had had such a powerful effect on the masses, ought to be
published as a separate book. Vladimir Ilyich had written her in
1922 a few warm lines of greeting, such as only he could
write.</P>
<p>
Alexandra Kalmykova was closely associated with the
"Emancipation of Labour" group. At one time (in 1899, I believe),
when Vera Zasulich came to Russia, Kalmykova arranged her illegal
sojourn in the country and saw her very often. Influenced by the
rising tide of the workers movement, by the articles and books of
the "Emancipation of Labour" group, and by the Petersburg
Social-Democrats, Potresov, and for a time Struve, went
Left. After a number of preliminary meetings, soundings were taken
for
joint work. It was decided to publish jointly a symposium <EM>Materials Characterizing Our Economic Development</EM>. Our group was represented on the editorial board by Vladimir Ilyich, Starkov, and Stepan Radchenko, theirs &#8211; by Struve, Potresov and Klasson. The fate of that publication is common knowledge. It was consigned to the flames by the 
tsarist censor. In the spring of 1895, before going abroad, Vladimir Ilyich kept going more and more often to Ozernoy Street, where Potresov then lived, to speed up the work.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich spent the summer of 1895 abroad, living part
of the time in Berlin, where he attended workers' meetings, and
partly in Switzerland, where he first met Plekhanov, Axelrod and
Zasulich. He came back full of impressions, and brought with him
a double lined suitcase crammed with illegal literature.</P>
<p>
The police started shadowing him the moment he arrived. They
had an eye on him and his suitcase. I had a cousin working at the
time at the Address Bureau. Two days after Vladimir Ilyich had
arrived she told me that a detective had come when she was on
night duty, and had gone through the files (which were arranged in
alphabetical order), saying boastfully: "There, we've tracked an
important state criminal &#8211; Ulyanov, his name is. His brother was
hanged, and this one's come from abroad. He won't get away now."
Knowing that I was acquainted with Vladimir Ilyich, my cousin lost
no time reporting this to me. Naturally, I warned Vladimir Ilyich
at once. Extreme caution was necessary. But the work could not
wait. We got busy. A division of labour was organized, and the
work was divided by districts. We started to draw up and circulate
leaflets. I remember Vladimir Ilyich drawing up the first leaflet
to the workers of the Semyannikov Works. We had
no printing facilities at the time. The leaflet was copied out in print hand and distributed by Babushkin. Two of the four copies were picked up by the watchmen, the other two, circulated from hand to hand. Leaflets were distributed in other districts as well. One was got out on Vasilyevsky Island for the women workers of the Laferme Tobacco Factory. A.A. Yakubova and Z. P. Nevzorova (Krzhizhanovskaya) resorted to the following method of distribution: they rolled the leaflets up so that they could conveniently be peeled off one by one, and arranged their aprons in a suitable manner. Then, as soon as the whistle blew, they walked swiftly towards the women workers, who came pouring out of the factory gates, and thrust the leaflets into the hands of the puzzled women almost at a run. The leaflet was a great success.</P>
<p>
Our leaflets and pamphlets roused the workers. It was
decided &#8211; seeing that we had an illegal print-shop to do it in &#8211; to
publish also a popular journal <EM>Rabocheye Deto (Workers'
Cause)</EM>. Vladimir Ilyich prepared the material for it with
great thoroughness. Every line of copy passed through his
hands. I remember a meeting at my place when Zaporozhets waxed
very enthusiastic about the material which he had succeeded in
collecting at a boot factory in the Moskovskaya Zastava
neighborhood. "They fine you there for everything," he said. "If
you set a heel on crooked you get fined right away." Vladimir
Ilyich laughed. "Well, if you set a heel on crooked," he said,
"then you're asking to be fined." He collected and checked all the
material very carefully, I remember, for instance, how the
material about the Thornton Mills was collected. I was to call out
my pupil Krolikov, who worked at the mills as a sorter (he had
been deported from St. Petersburg once), and collect all the
information from him according to the plan outlined by Vladimir
Ilyich. Krolikov arrived in a posh fur coat which he had borrowed
from somebody, and brought a bookful of notes which he
supplemented verbally. His information was very valuable. Vladimir
Ilyich fairly pounced on it. Afterwards A. A. Yabkubova and I,
with shawls over our heads to make us look like mill workers, went
to the Thornton hostel, where we visited both the single and
married quarters. Conditions there were appalling. It was only
from information gathered in this way that Vladimir Ilyich wrote
his correspondence and leaflets. Look at his leaflet to the men
and women employees of the Thornton Mills. What a thorough
knowledge of the subject it shows. And what a schooling this was
for all the comrades who worked at that time. That was when we
really learnt "to give attention to detail." And how deeply those
details have engraved themselves in our minds.</P>
<p>
Our <EM>Rabocheye Deto</EM> did not see the light of day. A
meeting was held in my rooms on December 8, at which a final
reading of the copy for the press was held. Vaneyev took the
duplicate for a last look through, while the other copy remained
with me. I went to Vaneyev the next morning to pick up the
corrected copy, but the servant told me that he had moved out the
night before. We had previously arranged with Vladimir Ilyich that
in case anything went wrong I was to make enquiries of his friend
Chebotaryov, who was a colleague of mine on the staff of the
Central Railway Administration where I was employed. Vladimir
Ilyich went there every day to dine. Chebotaryov was not in his
office. I went to his house. Vladimir Ilyich had not been to
dinner. Obviously, he had been arrested. Later in the day we found
out that a good many of our group had been arrested. The copy of
<EM>Rabocheye Deto </EM>left on my hands I gave to Nina Gerd for
safe-keeping. Nina was an old school friend of mine, the future
wife of Struve. Not to have any more of us arrested it was decided
for the time being not to print<EM> Rabocheye Deto</EM>.</P>
<p>
This St. Petersburg period of Vladimir Ilyich's work was of
great importance, although the work itself was not noteworthy and
hardly noticeable. He had described it so himself. It did not
show. It was a matter not of heroic deeds but of establishing
close contact with the masses, getting closer to them, learning to
be the vehicle of their
finest aspirations, learning how to win their confidence, and rally them behind us. But it was during this period of, his St. Petersburg work that Vladimir Ilyich was moulded as a leader of the working masses.</P>
<p>
When I first came to the school after these arrests,
Babushkin called me aside under the stairs and handed me a leaflet
concerning these arrests written by the workers. The leaflet was
of a purely political character. Babushkin asked me to get it
printed and to let them have copies for distribution. Till then
neither of us had ever directly mentioned my being connected with
the organization. I passed the leaflet on to our group. I remember
that meeting &#8211; it was at S. I. Radchenko's flat. All that remained
of our group had gathered there. Lyakhovsky read the leaflet and
exclaimed: "We can't print this leaflet &#8211; why, it's on a purely
political subject." But since the leaflet had undoubtedly been
written by the workers on their own initiative, and since they
insisted on its being printed, it was decided, to print it.</P>
<p>
It wasn't very long before we got in touch with Vladimir
Ilyich. In those days people committed for trial were freely
permitted to receive books. They were given only a perfunctory
examination, during which the tiny dots in the middle of the
letters and the slightly changed colour of the paper where milk
had been used for ink, escaped notice. The technique of secret
correspondence had made swift progress with us. Vladimir Ilyich's
concern for his imprisoned comrades was characteristic of
him. There was not a letter he sent out that did not contain some
request concerning a fellow prisoner. So-and-so had no one coming
to visit him &#8211; it was necessary to get him a "fiancee": or
so-and-so had to be told through visiting relatives to look for
letters in such-and-such a book in the prison library, on
such-and-such a page; another needed warm boots, and so on. He
corresponded with many of his imprisoned comrades, to whom his
letters meant a great deal. His letters dealing with work had a
cheering effect. The man who received them forgot that he was in
prison, and got down to work himself I remember the impression
those letters made (I was arrested myself in August 1896). They
came written in milk every Saturday, which was book-receiving
day. A glance at the secret mark would tell you that the book
contained a message. Hot water for tea would be handed round at
six o'clock, and then the wardress would conduct the non-political
criminals to church. By that time you bad the letter cut up in
strips, and your tea brewed, and the moment the wardress went away
you would begin dipping the strips in the hot tea to develop the
text. (We couldn't very well use a candle for this in prison, and
so Vladimir Ilyich hit on the hot water idea.) These letters were
wonderfully cheering and so absorbingly interesting to read! The
centre of all our work outside, Vladimir Ilyich even in prison was
the centre of contact with the outside world.</P>
<p>
Moreover, he worked a great deal in prison. It was there that
he prepared <EM>The Development of Capitalism in Russia.</EM> He
ordered all the necessary material and statistical handbooks in
his legal letters. "I am sorry they have let me out so soon,"
Vladimir Ilyich said jokingly when he was released for
deportation. "I haven't quite finished the book, and it will be
difficult to get books in Siberia." Besides T<EM>he Development of
Capitalism in Russia</EM>, Vladimir Ilyich wrote leaflets and
illegal pamphlets, and a draft programme for the First Congress
(which did not take place until 1898, although it was planned for
an earlier date), and gave his views on questions under discussion
In the organization. To avoid being caught in the act of writing
with milk, he kneaded little inkpots out of bread, which he
promptly popped into his mouth whenever he
heard the peep hole being opened. "Today I have eaten six inkpots," he would add to his letter by way of humorous remark.</P>
<p>
But for all his self-discipline and restraint, Vladimir
Ilyich could not help succumbing to the prison dumps. In one of
his letters he suggested the following plan. When they were taken
out for exercise one of the windows in the corridor afforded a
momentary glimpse of the street pavement in Shpalernaya. His idea
was that I and Appolinaria Yakubova, at a definite time, should
come and stand on that bit of pavement so that he could see
us. Appolinaria was unable to go for some reason, and so I went
alone and stood on the pavement for a long time several days
running. Only the plan did not work, I don't remember exactly
why.</P>
<p>
While Vladimir Ilyich was in prison, our work outside kept
expanding, and the workers' movement grew spontaneously. With the
arrest of Martov, Lyakhovsky and others, our group was weakened
still further. True, new comrades joined the group, but these
people were not so well up in theory and experience. There was no
time for them to learn, as the movement had to be taken care of
and demanded a lot of energy. Agitation was the order of the
day. We simply had no time to think of propaganda. Our leaflet
agitation was a great success. The strike of the thirty thousand
textile workers of St. Petersburg, which broke out in the summer
of 1896 and was influenced by the Social-Democrats, had turned
many heads.</P>
<p>
I remember Silvin reading out the draft of a leaflet at a
secret meeting in the woods at Pavlovsk (at the beginning of
August, I think it was). There was a phrase in it that definitely
limited the workers' movement to the sphere of economic
struggle. After reading it out, Silvin stopped and said
laughingly: "Well I never, what on earth made me say that!" The
phrase was crossed out. In the summer of 1896 our Lakhtinsky
printing plant was suppressed, and we were no longer able to print
our pamphlets. Arrangements for putting out the journal had to be
postponed indefinitely.</P>
<p>
During the strike of 1896 our group was joined by Takhtarev's
group, known as "The Monkeys," and by Chernyshev's group, known as
"The Cocks." But so long as the "Decembrists" were in prison and
kept in touch with the organization outside, the work ran its
usual course. When Vladimir Ilyich was released, I was still in
prison. Despite the dazed state of joy a man finds himself in on
coming out of prison, Vladimir Ilyich nevertheless contrived to
write me a short note on Party affairs. My mother told me that he
had even put on weight in prison and was as cheerful as ever.</P>
<p>
I was released soon after the Vetrova affair (a prisoner named
Vetrova had burned herself alive in the Peter and Paul
Fortres). The gendarmes released quite a number of women
prisoners, including myself. I was to remain in St. Petersburg
until my case was finished, and two detectives were employed to
shadow me. I found the organization in a very sad state. Stepan
Radchenko and his wife were all that remained of the active
members of our group. He could not carry on with the work for
reasons of secrecy, but he continued to act as centre and
maintained contacts. He was in touch with Struve too. Struve
shortly afterwards married N. A. Gerd, the Social-Democrat &#8211; he was
himself a Social-Democrat of a sort at that time. He was quite
incapable of doing any work in the organization, leave alone
underground work, but it flattered him, no doubt to be called on
for advice. He even wrote a manifesto for the First Congress of
the Social-Democratic Labour Party. In the winter of 1897-98 I
went to see Struve fairly often on behalf of Vladimir
Ilyich. Struve was then publishing the <EM>Novoye Slovo (New
Word)</EM> magazine, and besides, his wife was an old friend of
mine. I studied Struve at the time. He was a Social-Democrat then,
but what surprised me was his bookishness and his almost complete
lack of interest in "the living tree of life," an interest which
Vladimir Ilyich had so much of. Struve got a translation job for
me and undertook to edit it. He found the work irksome, though,
and quickly tired. (Vladimir Ilyich would sit with me for hours
over similar work. But then his style of work was quite different;
with him even such a job as translation was a labour of love.)
Struve read Fet for relaxation. Someone has written of Lenin that
he was fond of reading Fet. That isn't true. Fet was an
out-and-out advocate of serfdom, with nothing in him you could get
your teeth into. If anyone was fond of Fet, it was Struve.</P>
<p>
I also knew Tugan-Baranovsky, I went to school with his wife,
Lydia Davydova (whose mother was the publisher of the magazine<EM>
Mir Bozhy (God's World)</EM> and I used to call on them at one
time. Lydia was a very good and clever woman, although
weak-willed. She was cleverer than her husband. You always felt in
talking to him that he was not one of us. I once went to him with
a collecting list to support a strike (the Kostroma strike, I
believe it was). He gave me something &#8211; I don't remember how many
rubles-but I was obliged to listen to a little lecture on the
subject of "I don't understand why strikes should be supported &#8211; a
strike is an inadequate method of fighting the employers." I took
the money and hurried away.</P>
<p>
I wrote to Vladimir Ilyich in exile about everything I saw and
heard. There was little I could write about the work of the
organization, however. At the time of the First Congress it
consisted only of four people: S. I. Radchenko, his wife Lyubov,
Sammer, and I. Our delegate was Radchenko. On his return from the
Congress, however, he hardly told us anything about it. He took
out the already familiar "Manifesto" by Struve, which was hidden
between the covers of a book, and burst out crying. Nearly all the
Congress delegates had been arrested.</P>
<p>
I was banished to the Ufa Gubernia for three years, but
obtained a transfer to the village of Shushenskoye in the
Minusinsk Uyezd, where Vladimir Ilyich lived, by describing myself
as his fiancee.</p>
