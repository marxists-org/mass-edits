<p>
Preparations for the conference were energetically being
made. Vladimir Ilyich got in touch with Nemec, the Czech
representative on the International Socialist Bureau, on the
question of arranging the conference in Prague. The advantage
of holding it in Prague was that there was no Russian colony
there, and, besides, Ilyich knew Prague, where he had lived during
his first emigration at Modracek's.</P>
<p>
Two incidents connected with the Prague Conference stand
out in my memory (I was not present at the conference itself). One
was the dispute between Savva (Zevin), the Ekaterinoslav delegate
and former student of the Longjumeau school, and the Kiev delegate
David (Schwartzman) and also, I believe, Sergo. I remember Savva's
excited face. I forget exactly what the dispute was about, but
Savva was a Plekhanovite. Plekhanov had not come to the
conference. "The make-up of your conference," he had written in
reply to the invitation, "is so uniform that it would be better,
that is, more in the interests of Party
unity, if I took no part in it." He worked Savva up accordingly, and the latter moved protest after protest at the conference in the Plekhanov spirit. Later, as we know, Savva became a Bolshevik. The other Plekhanovite, David, sided with the Bolsheviks. The talk, as far as I remember,
was about whether Savva should go to the conference or not. In Longjumeau Savva had always been a cheerful steady man, and this excitement of his surprised me.</P>
<p>
Another incident. Vladimir Ilyich had already gone to Prague,
when Philip (Goloshchokin) and Brendinsky arrived to go together
to the Party conference. I had known Brendinsky only by name as
a transport man. He lived in Dvinsk. His main duty was to
forward the literature on to the organizations, chiefly to
Moscow. Philip began to have his doubts about Brendinsky. He had
a father and sister living in Dvinsk. Before going abroad Philip
went to see his father. Brendinsky lived in rooms at the home of
Philip's sister. The old man warned Philip not to trust
Brendinsky, who, he said, was behaving strangely and lived above
his means, throwing money about. A fortnight before the
conference took place Brendinsky was arrested and released
within a few days. While he was in custody however, several
people came to see him. These people were arrested. Who they
were is unknown. Crossing the frontier together was another
suspicious circumstance in Philip's mind. Philip came to our
house together with Brendinsky and I was very glad to see them,
but Philip squeezed my hand meaningly and looked at me in a way
that told me he had something to say to me about
Brendinsky. Afterwards, in the passage, he told me about his
suspicions. We arranged that he would go away and we would see
each other later. Meanwhile I was to have a talk with Brendinsky
to sound him out, and we would decide what to do afterwards.</P>
<p>
My talk with Brendinsky was a very odd one. We had been
receiving information from Pyatnitsky that the literature was
being safely transported and delivered in Moscow, but the
Muscovites complained that they were not getting anything. I began
asking Brendinsky to whom he was sending the literature, to what
address. He looked embarrassed and said that he was not forwarding
it to the organization as that was dangerous now. He was
handing it to workers of his acquaintance. I asked their names. He gave them obviously at random, saying that he did not remember their addresses. The man was clearly lying. I began to question him about his round of the towns, and asked him about the town &#8211; Yaroslavl, I believe. He said he could not go there because he had been arrested there once. "On what charge?" I asked him. And he answered: "On a criminal charge." I was taken aback. His answers became more and more confused. I told him a story about the conference being held in Brittany and about Ilyich and Zinoviev having already left for that place. Afterwards I arranged with Philip that he and Grigory were to leave for Prague in the night and leave a note for Brendinsky saying that they had gone to Brittany. That is what they did. After that I called on Burtsev, who, at that time, had specialized in detecting agent provocateurs. "He's obviously an agent provocateur," I told him. Burtsev heard me out and said: "Send him to me." But there was no need to. A telegram was received from Pyatnitsky, whose suspicions had been aroused, too, saying that Brendinsky should be kept away from the conference. It was followed by a detailed letter. Brendinsky was thus prevented from attending the conference. He never returned to Russia. The tsarist government bought him a villa outside Paris for forty thousand francs.</P>
<p>
I was very proud of the fact that I had been responsible for
keeping an agent provocateur away from the conference. Little did
I know that two other provocateurs were present at the Prague
Conference &#8211; Roman Malinovsky and Romanov (Alya Alexinsky), a
former Capri student.</P>
<p>
The Prague Conference was the first conference with Party
workers from Russia which we succeeded in calling after 1908 and
at which we were able in a business-like manner to discuss
questions relating to the work in Russia and frame a clear line
for this work. Resolutions were adopted on the issues of the
moment and the tasks of the Party, on the elections to the Fourth
Duma, on the Social-Democratic group in the Duma, on the character
and organizational forms of Party work, on the tasks of the
Social-Democrats in the anti-famine campaign, on the attitude
towards the State Insurance for Workers bill before the Duma,
and on the petition campaign.</P>
<p>
The results of the Prague Conference were a clearly defined
Party line on questions of work in Russia, and real leadership of
practical work.</P>
<p>
Therein lay its tremendous significance. A Central Committee
was elected at the conference, of which Lenin, Zinoviev,
Orjonikidze (Serge), Schwartzman (David) Goloshchokin (Philip),
Spandaryan and Malinovsky were members. Candidates were nominated
to replace arrested members, if any. Soon after the conference
Stalin and Belostotsky (a student of the Longjumeau school) were
co-opted to the C.C. A unity was achieved on the C.C. without
which it would have been impossible to carry on the work at such a
difficult time. Undoubtedly the conference was a big step forward
in that it put a stop to the disintegration of the work in
Russia. Although the acrimonious abuse of the Liquidators and
Trotsky, and the diplomacy of Plekhanov and the Bundists called
for a stern rebuff and exposure, these disputes did not loom large
at the conference, where attention was focussed on the work in
Russia. The fact that Malinovsky was a member of the C.C., the
fact that the meeting with the representatives of the Third Duma,
Poletayev and Shurkanov, held in Leipzig after the conference, had
also become known to the police (Shurkanov turned out to be an
agent provocateur too) &#8211; all this was no great harm. Undoubtedly,
the agent provocateurs got Party workers into trouble and weakened
the organization, but the police were powerless to stem the rising
tide of the working-class movement. On the other hand the framing
of a correct policy guided the movement into the right channel and
stimulated the steady growth of new forces.</P>
<p>
From Leipzig, where he had gone to confer with Poletayev and
Shurkanov, Vladimir Ilyich went to Berlin to make arrangements
with the "trustees" for refunding the money, which was now needed
more than ever for the work. Meanwhile Shotman arrived in Paris to
see us. He had been working lately in Finland. The Prague
Conference had adopted a resolution strongly condemning the policy
of tsarism and the Third Duma towards Finland, and emphasizing the
common aims of the workers of Finland and Russia in the struggle
against tsarism and the Russian counter-revolutionary
bourgeoisie. Our organization was working illegally in Finland at
the time. Work was being carried on among the sailors of the
Baltic Fleet, and Shotman had come to report that all was set for
the rebellion in Finland. The illegal organization working
among the Russian troops was ready for action (they had planned to
seize the Sveaborg and Kronstadt forts). Ilyich was still
away. When he returned he questioned Shotman closely about the
organization, the very existence of which was an interesting fact
(Rahja, S. Vorobyov and Kokko were working in it), but he pointed
out that such action at the present moment was inadvisable. It was
doubtful whether the St. Petersburg workers would support the
rebellion at this moment. Things never reached the rebellion
stage, however. The organization was discovered, and presently
wholesale arrests were made, fifty-two persons being committed for
trial on a charge of conspiring to insurrection. The uprising was
still a long way off, of course, but the Lena gold-fields
shootings in the middle of April and the widespread protest
strikes vividly revealed the extent to which the proletariat
had developed in recent years, and showed that they had
forgotten nothing, that the movement was rising to a higher stage,
and that quite new conditions of work were being created.</P>
<p>
Ilyich became another man. His nerves were steadier, he
became more concentrated, and gave more thought to the tasks that
now confronted the Russian working-class movement. His mood was
perhaps best expressed in his
article on Herzen, written in the beginning of May. There
was so much of Ilyich in that article, so much of the Ilyich ardour that gripped one and swept one off one's feet.</P>
<p>
"In commemorating Herzen we clearly see the three generations,
the three classes that were active in the Russian revolution,"
he wrote. "At first &#8211; nobles and landlords, the Decembrists and
Herzen. The circle of these revolutionaries was a narrow
one. They were very far removed from the people. But their work
was not in vain. The Decembrists awakened Herzen. Herzen
launched revolutionary agitation.</P>
<p>
"This agitation was taken up, extended, strengthened, and
tempered by the revolutionary commoners, beginning with
Chernyshevsky and ending with the heroes of the <EM>Narodnaya
Volya.</EM> The circle of fighters widened, their contacts with
the people became closer. 'The young helmsmen of the impending
storm', Herzen said of them. But as yet it was not the storm
itself.</P>
<p>
"The storm is the movement of the masses themselves. The
proletariat, the only class that is revolutionary to the end, rose
at the head of the masses and for the first time aroused millions
of peasants to open revolutionary struggle. The first onslaught in
this storm took place in 1905. The next is beginning to develop
before our very eyes." </P>
<p>
Only a few months before this Vladimir Ilyich had said with a
touch of sadness to Anna Ilyinichna, who had arrived in Paris: "I
do not know whether I'll live to see the next rise of the tide,"
and now he felt the gathering storm, the movement of the masses
themselves, with all his being.</P>
<p>
When the first number of<EM> Pravda</EM> came out we were
preparing to move to Cracow. In many ways Cracow was more
convenient than Paris. It was more convenient in regard to the
police. The French police cooperated closely with the Russian,
whereas the Polish police were hostile to the Russian police, as
they were to the Russian Government as a whole. In Cracow we could
rest assured that our letters would not be tampered with and that
new arrivals would not be spied on. Another advantage was the
proximity of the Russian frontier. People could cross it very
often. The mail to Russia was not held up. We made hasty
preparations for departure. Vladimir Ilyich cheered up and became
more than usually solicitous of the comrades who were remaining
behind. Our flat was crowded with comers and goers.</P>
<p>
I remember Kurnatovsky came too. We had known Kurnatovsky in
Siberian exile in Shushenskoye. This was his third term of
exile. He had graduated the Zurich University, was a chemical
engineer by trade, and worked in a sugar refinery near
Minusinsk. On returning to Russia he was arrested again in
Tiflis. He spent two years in prison in the Metekh fortsess, and
was then deported to Yakutsk. On the way there he got mixed up in
the "Ramanov affair"* and was sentenced in 1904 to twelve years'
penal servitude. He was amnestied in 1905, organized the "Chita
Republic," was seized by Meller-Zakomelsky and handed over to
General Rennenkampf. He was sentenced to death and taken by train
to see the revolutionaries shot. Afterwards, his sentence was
commuted to exile for life. Kurnatovsky succeeded in making his
escape from Nerchinsk to Japan in 1906. He made his way to
Australia, where he had a very tough time. He worked for a while
as a lumber-jack, caught a cold, got an inflammation or something
in his ear, and seriously impaired his health. He barely managed
to make his way to Paris.</P>
<p>
His hard life had taken it out of him. On his arrival in the
autumn of 1910 Ilyich and I went to see him in the hospital. He
suffered from terrible headaches. Ekaterina Okulova visited him
with her little daughter Irina, who used to write him notes in her
childish scrawl, as he was half deaf. He recovered slightly, then
fell in with the conciliators and began to talk their way. After
that our friendship cooled off a bit. We were all highly
strung. In the autumn of 1911 I dropped in to see him once &#8211; he
lived in a small room on the Boulevard Montparnasse. I
brought him some of our newspapers, told him about the school in
Longjumeau, and had a good long talk with him. He agreed
unreservedly with the line of the Central Committee. Ilyich was
pleased, and began to visit him frequently. Kurnatovsky looked at
us packing our things; and watching my mother's cheerful activity,
he said: "Some people have got energy." In the autumn of 1912,
when we were already in Cracow, Kurnatovsky died.</P>
<p>
We gave our flat over to a Pole, a Cracow precentor, who took
it furnished. He kept asking Ilyich all kinds of domestic
questions: "What's the price of geese? How much is veal?" Ilyich
was at a loss. "Geese? Veal?" He had had very little to do with
the housekeeping, and I was not helpful either, because we had
never eaten goose or veal during our stay in Paris. I could have
told the precentor the price of horse-flesh and lettuce, but he
was not interested in them.</P>
<p>
Our people in Paris felt strongly drawn towards Russia at the
time. Inessa, Safarov, and others were preparing to go there. As
for us, we decided to move a little nearer to Russia for the time
being.</P>
