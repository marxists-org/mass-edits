<p>
The year 1919 was a year of sharp civil war against Kolchak,
Denikin and Yudenich. The fight was conducted under extremely
difficult conditions of famine and widespread economic
ruin. Factories and mills were at a standstill, and the railways
were completely disorganized. The Red Army was not properly
organized yet and was poorly armed. In many places the Soviet
power was not properly established yet, and had not identified
itself with the population. Parties hostile to the Soviet power,
all those elements who had lived in clover under the old
regime&mdash;the servants of the landowners and capitalists, the
kulaks, tradesmen, etc.&mdash;carried on a furious agitation
against the Bolsheviks, and played on the ignorance and lack of
information among the peasant mass to spread all kinds of
cock-and-bull stories among them.</p><p>
Lenin's name, however, already enjoyed great prestige everywhere. Lenin was against the landowners and the capitalists. Lenin stood for the land, for peace. Everyone knew that Lenin was the leader of the struggle for the power of the Soviets. The masses knew that in every out-of-the-way corner of the country. But Lenin took no direct part in the fighting, he was not at the fronts, and it was difficult for illiterate people in those days, people whose outlook was limited by the secluded life they led, to imagine how anyone could effect leadership at a distance. And so legends grew up around the name of Lenin. The fishermen of Lake Baikal in far-away Siberia, for instance, related about ten years ago, how at the height of a battle with the Whites, Ilyich had come flying up in an airplane and helped them to overcome the enemy. In the North Caucasus people said that although they had not seen Lenin, they knew for certain that he had fought there in the ranks of the Red Army, only he had done so secretly, so that nobody knew, and had helped them to gain a victory.</p><p>
Today the workers and collective farmers know that although
Ilyich had not been at the fronts, he had been with the Red Army
all the time heart and soul, he had always been thinking about
it, caring for it. They know how hard he had been working to
direct the policy into the right channels. He was Chairman of
the Council of People's Commissars; his activities were varied,
but whatever form they took, they were intimately bound up with
the questions of the civil war, the questions of the struggle
for the power of the Soviets. On March 13, 1919, Ilyich
addressed a meeting in Petrograd at which he spoke about the
successes and difficulties facing the Soviet power.</p><p>
"For the first time in history an army is being built on closeness, on inseparable closeness, one might say, <em>inseparable unity between the Soviets and the army.</em> (My italics.-N.K.) The Soviets unite all the working people and the exploited&mdash;and the army is built up on the principle of socialist defence and class-consciousness." (Works, Vol. 29, p. 47.)</p><p>
This unity of interests was expressed in a thousand little
ways. The Soviet Government was the Red Army man's own familiar
government.</p><p>
Ilyich liked to sleep with the windows open. Every morning the singing of the Red Army men, who lived in the Kremlin, would burst into the room from outside. "We shall die to a man for the power of the Soviets," sang the young voices.</p><p>
Ilyich knew perfectly well what was going on at the fronts. He
was in direct touch with the fronts and headed the whole
struggle, while at the same time he lent an attentive ear to
what the masses were saying about the war. I was sometimes
present during Ilyich's talks with different people, and I
noticed how good he was at drawing them out on subjects that
interested him. And he was interested in the whole situation, in
everything that went on at the fronts.</p><p>
I remember being present at a report made to Ilyich concerning the mistrust towards the old military specialists on the part of the Red Army men. At the beginning we had been obliged to take lessons from the old military specialists&mdash;that much, the Red Army men understood, but they regarded them nevertheless with suspicion and were intolerant of even their petty faults. This was understandable when one remembers what a gulf there had been between the commanding officers and the soldiers under the old regime. After the man who had made the report had gone, Ilyich spoke to me about the strength of the Red Army lying in the fact that its commanders stood so close to the mass of the soldiers. We were reminded of Vereshchagin's pictures portraying the war with Turkey in 1877-
1878. They were fine paintings. He has one battle scene in which the commanding officers are shown standing on a mound, watching the battle from afar. Spruce officers in gloves watch the soldiers dying in battle through binoculars, themselves standing at a safe distance. I first saw this picture when I was ten. My father had taken me to the exhibition of Vereshchagin's paintings, and his pictures had burned themselves into my memory for a lifetime.</p><p>
Ilyich once received a letter from Professor Dukelsky, in
Voronezh, who demanded comradely treatment of specialists on the
part of the Red Army men. Ilyich answered him with an article in
<em>Pravda,</em> in which he said:</p><p>
"Show a comradely attitude towards the exhausted soldiers, the tired-out workers, embittered by centuries of exploitation, and then the rapprochement between the workers of physical and mental work will advance in gigantic strides." (Ibid., p. 207.)</p><p>
I was once present during Lunacharsky's report to Ilyich after a
visit of his to the front. Lunacharsky, of course, was no great
specialist in military matters, but Ilyich kept asking him such
questions, kept linking together a number of seemingly unrelated
facts and steered the speaker skilfully into such channels, that
it turned out to be a report of absorbing interest. Ilyich
always knew what to ask this or that person and how to get the
information he wanted from him. He talked with many workers
going to or coming from the front. Ilyich had a good idea of the
face of the Red Army, he knew that most of the Red Army men were
peasants. He knew the peasantry well, knew how the toiling
peasantry had been exploited by the landowners, how they hated
the landowners, and what a tremendous motive force it was in the
civil war. He did not idealize the individual farmer, though
(and the peasants in those days were all individual farmers); he
knew how strong and tenacious the petty-bourgeois mentality was
among the peasantry, how difficult it was for the peasants to
organize, how helpless, in fact, the peasant was in those days
in the matter of organization.</p><p>
The crux of socialist construction is organization, Ilyich never tired of repeating. He attached tremendous importance to questions of organization, and set his hopes on the working class, on its organizing experience, its close ties with the peasantry. Ilyich demanded that the entire experience of the old army and the old specialists should be mastered, he demanded that knowledge and science should be placed at the service of the working people of the Soviet Republic.</p><p>
The policy of the Soviet Government was directed the right way.</p><p>
In his interview with the first American labour delegation in September 1927, Stalin said:</p><p>
"Is it not known that the outcome of the civil war was that the
armies of occupation were driven from Russia and the
counter-revolutionary generals were wiped out by the Red
Army?</p><p>
"It turned out that the <em>fate of a war is decided in the last analysis</em> not by technical equipment, with which Kolchak and Denikin were plentifully supplied by the enemies of the U.S.S.R.,<em> but by a correct policy, by the sympathy and support of the vast masses of the population.</em> (My italics.&mdash;N.K.)</p><p>
"Was it an accident that the Bolshevik Party proved victorious then? Of course not."</p><p>
The policy of the Soviet Government in 1919 was directed towards strengthening the ties with the masses.</p><p>
"If we call ourselves a Party of Communists, said Ilyich,
"we should realize that only now, when we have finished with
external obstacles and scrapped the old institutions does the
first task of a real proletarian revolution-that of organizing
dozens and hundreds of millions of people&mdash;face us actually
and fully for the first time." (Works, Vol. 29, p. 310.)</p><p>
At the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets in October 1917 Ilyich said that the crux of socialist construction was organization, and seventeen months later, in March 1919, at the time of the Eighth Congress of the Party, when the Soviet power was securely on its feet, the problems of organization loomed large. All the questions which Ilyich dealt with at the Eighth Congress were closely linked with the problems of organization. He spoke about office staffs, about bureaucracy and culture, about how the lack of culture stood in the way of socialist construction, prevented the broad masses from being drawn into socialist construction, hampered the fight against survivals of the past and interfered with the rooting up of bureaucracy; he spoke about the village, about strengthening the influence of the proletariat not only upon the rural workers and the poor, but upon the broadest sections of the peasantry, the middle peasants, who lived by their own labour without exploiting hired labour; he said that they had to be made the mainstay of the Soviet power, that they had to be catered to in the matter of supply; he spoke about the cooperative movement, and said that communism should be built out of what capitalism had left us as a legacy, that communism could not be built up with the hands of the Communists alone, that the old specialists, science, the whole experience of bourgeois construction had to be made use of for our own purposes.</p><p>
The important thing in all this work was for people to know not
only what link had to be grasped in order to pull out the whole
chain, but how that link had to be grasped, <em>how </em>the
chain was to be pulled out.</p><p>
Two days before the congress Yakov Sverdlov, the Chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, died. In his speech at Sverdlov's funeral, Ilyich spoke about his ability to link theory with practice, about his moral prestige and organizing talent, laying special stress on the value of his work as an <em>organizer of the broad proletarian masses:</em></p><p>
"...This professional revolutionary never for a moment lost
touch with the masses. Although the conditions of tsarism
necessitated his working chiefly underground, illegally, as did
most of the revolutionaries at that time, Comrade Sverdlov
managed even then, in his underground and illegal activity, to
march shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand with the advanced
workers, who already from the beginning of the twentieth century
began to take the place of the previous generation of
revolutionaries from amongst the intelligentsia.</p><p>
"It was at that time that the advanced workers came into the job
by the dozen and the hundred and cultivated in themselves that
hard tempering in the revolutionary struggle combined with the
closest contact with the masses without which the revolution of
the proletariat in Russia could not have succeeded." (Works,
Vol. 29, p. 72.)</p><p>
At the Eighth Congress of the Party
Sverdlov was to have made a report on the organizational work of
the
Central Committee. This report was made instead by Lenin.</p><p>
Speaking of Sverdlov, Ilyich said:</p><p>
"Possessing as he did a vast, an incredibly vast memory, he kept
in it the greater part of his report, and <em>his personal
acquaintance with the work of organization locally </em>(my
italics&mdash;N.K.) would have enabled him to make this report. I
am unable to replace him even in one-hundredth degree ... dozens
of delegates were received by Comrade Sverdlov daily and more
than half of them were probably not Soviet officials but Party
workers." (Ibid., p. 140.)</p><p>
Ilyich spoke about Sverdlov
having been an excellent judge of people with a remarkable flair
for practical matters:</p><p>
"It is to the remarkable organizing talent of this man that we owe what we have so far taken such legitimate pride in. It is to him we owe the possibility of efficient, expedient and really organized teamwork, the kind of work that would be worthy of the organized proletarian masses and meet the needs of the proletarian revolution&mdash;that organized teamwork without which we could not have scored a single success, without which we would not have overcome a single one of those innumerable difficulties, a single one of those painful trials through which we have already passed and are now obliged to pass.</p><p>
"...We are profoundly convinced that the proletarian revolution
in Russia and throughout the world will bring to the fore groups
and groups of people, numerous layers of the proletarians and
the toiling peasantry, who will provide that practical
experience, that <em>collective,</em> if not individual,
<em>organizing talent</em> (my italics&mdash;N.K.) without
which the many-millioned armies of proletarians would not be
able to achieve victory." (Ibid., pp. 73, 75.)</p><p>
In recent
years, especially in 1935-1936, we are witnessing a remarkable
and rapid growth in the <em>organizing talent of the
masses.</em> The conferences of Stakhanovites, combine
operators, tractor drivers, Soviet land workers, and workers of
the Soviet republics afford us an example of this collective
organizing genius which has been developed during the period of
Soviet Government.</p><p>
We are not mere units, we are
thousands....</p><p>
None but a blind man could fail to grasp what .a tremendous power the collective organizing genius of the proletarian masses represents.</p>
<hr class="end">
<p>
The mentality of the petty proprietor was a special obstacle to
the organization of administrative and army work during the
early years of the Soviet Government's existence.</p><p>
At the First All-Russian Congress on Extra-School Education in May 1919 Ilyich spoke at some length on the question of this petty-proprietor anarchic mentality, which hampered the proper organization of work.</p><p>
<em> "The broad masses of the petty-bourgeois working
population, while striving towards knowledge and smashing up the
old, could introduce nothing of organized or organizing
value."</em> (My italics&mdash;N.K.)</p><p>
And further:</p><p>
"We are still suffering in this respect from muzhik naivete and muzhik helplessness, like that peasant, who, after robbing the master's library, ran home, fearing that someone would take it away from him, because the idea that there could be a correct distribution, that the public chest is not something hateful, but the common property of the workers and the toiling population&mdash;that consciousness was still lacking in him. The undeveloped peasant mass is not to blame for this, and from the point of view of the development of the revolution this is quite legitimate&#151;it is an inevitable phase, and when the peasant took the library home and kept it there in secret, he could not act otherwise, because he did not understand that the libraries of Russia could be joined together, that
there would be enough books to gratify the thirst of the literate and teach the illiterate. Now we must combat the survivals of disorganization, chaos and ridiculous departmental disputes ... not set up parallel organizations, but create a single planned organization. In this small job is reflected the basic task of our revolution. If it fails to solve this task, if it will not emerge upon the path of creating a really planned united organization in place of Russian muddle-headed chaos and absurdity, that revolution will then remain a bourgeois revolution, for the basic characteristic of a proletarian revolution heading for communism consists precisely in this." (Works, Vol. 29, pp. 308, 309-10.)</p><p>
Ilyich here revealed the roots of anarchism, which denies all
planned collective effort, all forms of state organization, on
the principle of "I do as I please." </p><p>Ilyich and I often
talked about anarchism. I remember our first conversation on
that subject at Shushenskoye. On joining Ilyich in Siberian
exile, I examined with interest his album containing photographs
of political convicts. Between two photographs of Chernyshevsky,
I saw one of Zola. I asked him why he kept a photograph of Zola
in his album. He began telling me about Dreyfus, whom Zola had
defended, then we began comparing notes about Zola's books, and
I told him what a deep impression his novel <em>Germinal
</em>had made upon me&mdash;I had first read it when I was deep
in study of the first volume of Marx's <em>Capital.
Germinal</em> describes the French labour movement and
contains, among others, the figure of a Russian Anarchist t
Suvarine, who strokes a pet rabbit while at the same time
repeating that everything should be "smashed and destroyed"
<em>(tout rompre, tout detruire)</em>. Ilyich had spoken warmly
about the differences between an organized socialist labour
movement and anarchism. I dimly recollect another talk with
Ilyich on the same subject of the Anarchists on the eve of his
departure to attend the Tammerfors Conference in 1905. I have
recently reread Ilyich's article "Socialism and Anarchism,"
relating to that period, in which he gives an excellent
characterization of anarchism: "The philosophy of the Anarchists
is bourgeois philosophy turned inside out. Their individualistic
theories and their individualistic ideals are the very
antithesis of socialism. Their views express, not the future of
bourgeois society, which is irresistibly heading towards the
socialization of labour, but the present and even the past of
that society, the domination of blind chance over the scattered,
isolated small producer. Their tactics, which amount to the
negation of the political struggle, disunite the proletarians
and in fact convert them into passive participants of one or
another set of bourgeois politics; because it is impossible for
the workers really to detach themselves from politics." (Works,
Vol. 10, p. 55.)</p><p>
This was what Ilyich and I had talked
about in 1905.</p><p>
In May 1919 the First All-Russian Congress on Extra-School Education was held. It was greeted by Ilyich. The congress was attended by eight hundred delegates, among whom there were many non-Party people. The general atmosphere was one of enthusiasm&mdash;many of the delegates were preparing to go to the front&#151;but we, Bolsheviks, who had organized the congress, saw that on many questions the delegates lacked a clear understanding of Soviet democracy, of that which distinguished our Soviet democracy from bourgeois democracy, and we asked Ilyich to make another speech at the congress. He consented and delivered a long speech on May 19 on the subject of "The Deception of the People by the Slogans of Freedom and Equality." He spoke about how the people were deceived by these slogans in the capitalist states, said that the Soviet power&#151;the dictatorship of the proletariat&#151;would now lead the masses to socialism, and spoke about the difficulties that still confronted the Soviet Government.</p><p>
"This new organization of the state is being born with the
greatest difficulty because to overcome disorganizing,
petty-bourgeois lack of discipline is the most difficult thing,
is a million times more difficult than overcoming the landlord
violator or the capitalist violator, but it is a million times
more fruitful for the creation of a new organization free from
exploitation. When proletarian organization solves this task,
then socialism has won finally. The whole of the activity of
both extra-school and school education must be devoted to
this." (Works, Vol. 29, pp. 345-46.)</p><p>
But if a struggle was needed against anarchist moods in the business of building up the Soviet power, all the more necessary was it in the Red Army. Anarchist moods there took the form of sheer insubordination. The experience of the civil war in the Ukraine best illustrates these difficulties in organizing the Red Army. Ilyich spoke about this on July 4, 1919, when he addressed a joint meeting of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, the Moscow Soviet of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies, the Moscow Council of Trade Unions and delegates of Moscow's factory committees.</p><p>
Ilyich spoke about the difficulties of the first year of civil
war, when we were obliged to form our detachments hastily one
after another.</p><p>
"The extremely low level of proletarian political consciousness
in the Ukraine," Ilyich said, "combined with weakness and poor
organization, Petlura disorganization, and the pressure of
German imperialism, provided fruitful soil for enmity and
guerrilla methods. In every detachment the peasants snatched up
arms, elected their ataman or headman in order to set up a local
authority. They ignored the central authorities completely, and
every headman imagined himself to be a local ataman who could
settle all Ukrainian questions himself regardless of what was
being undertaken in the centre." (Ibid., pp. 424-25.)</p><p>Ilyich went on to say that this lack of organization,
these guerrilla methods and chaos, were having a disastrous
effect on the Ukraine. It was an experience that would leave its
mark upon the country.</p><p>
"This lesson of disorganization and chaos has been realized in the Ukraine," Ilyich said. "I will be a turning point for the whole Ukrainian revolution, and will affect the whole development of the Ukraine. It is a turning point which we, too, have passed, a change from guerrilla methods and the throwing about of revolutionary phrases&mdash;we can do anything!&#151;to a realization of the necessity of long, hard, dogged organizational work. It was the path we entered upon many months after October and achieved considerable success in. W'e look to the future absolutely confident that we shall overcome all difficulties." (Ibid., p. 426.)</p><p>
Ilyich's hopes were fulfilled. Our Red Army became a model of socialist organization.</p><p>
At that time, in 1919, most of the Red Army men were individual peasant farmers, who were not afraid of hard work, but in whom the mentality of the petty proprietor was still strong. Ilyich therefore considered it very important to have all the fronts strengthened by proletarian elements. He wrote a letter to the Petrograd workers about rendering aid to the Eastern Front, when the situation there became critical; he made a speech at a meeting of the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions, addressed the railway workers of the Moscow terminus, spoke about fighting Yolchak at a conference of Moscow factory committees and trade unions, wrote to the workers and peasants concerning the victory over Kolchak, spoke about the role of the Petrograd workers, delivered a speech to the mobilized workers of the Yaroslavl and Vladimir gubernias, who were going out to the Denikin front and to help defend Petrograd against Yudenich, wrote an appeal
to the workers and Red Army men of Petrograd in connection with the Yudenich threat, and wrote a letter to the workers and peasants of the Ukraine about the victory over Denikin.</p><p>
The organization of the Red Army was steadily improving.</p><p>
In proportion as the Soviet power struck root and the civil war opened the eyes of the masses as to who was their real friend and their real enemy, the influence of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries weakened. Feeling the ground slipping from under their feet, they banded with the Anarchists with whom they organized a bomb outrage in Leontyevsky Street on September 25, where the Moscow Committee of the Party was discussing questions of agitation and propaganda. Twelve were killed, including the Secretary of the Moscow Committee Zagorsky, and fifty-five were wounded. We first heard the news of the outrage from Inessa Armand, who came to see us. Her daughter had been at that meeting.</p>
<hr class="end">
<p>
While pointing out the scattered isolated character of small
peasant economy and the adverse effect it had upon the lives and
outlook of the peasants, Ilyich from the very outset stressed
the need for passing over to collective forms of husbandry. He
said that large-scale collective associations had to be set up
for the common cultivation of the land in the form of
agricultural communes and artels. He considered that the urban
and agricultural workers would be the initiators in this matter,
and supported all and every initiative by the workers in this
respect. We know that as early as in the spring of 1918 he
supported the initiative of the Obukhov and Semyannikov workers
who went out to Semipalatinsk in Siberia to organize
agricultural artels. He supported all efforts on a more modest
scale to organize the collective cultivation of the land.</p><p>
Ilyich, of course, had no illusions. He constantly spoke about the conditions that had to be created before mass collectivization of agriculture could be made practicable. At the Thirteenth Congress of the Party he spoke about tractors, about mechanized land cultivation, and the necessity of rousing the peasants, without which collectivization would make no real headway, while at the same time he believed that every initiative in the setting up of collective farms should be supported.</p><p>
In the spring of 1919 Ilyich posed the question of organizing a
collective farm of a new type to the workers of Gorki, where he
lived. However, most of the workers there were unprepared for
it. Reinbot, the former owner of Gorki, had picked Lettish
workers for his estate, whom lie had tried to keep apart,
isolated from the rest of the population. The workers of Gorki,
like all the Lettish workers, hated the landowners, but they
were ill fitted at the time for collective work, for organizing
the estate along state-farm lines.</p><p>
I remember, how, at a meeting at the manor, Ilyich earnestly tried to talk them over. But nothing came of his persuasive efforts. The Reinbot property was shared out, and Gorki turned into an ordinary state-run farm. Ilyich wanted the state farms to serve as a model of efficient large-scale farming to the peasants; the latter knew how to run a small farm, but they still had to learn how to run a large one.</p><p>
The manager of Gorki at the time&mdash;Vever&#151;did not grasp
Ilyich's ideas in regard to the state farm. One day, when Ilyich
was out walking, he met Vever and asked him how the state farm
was helping the local peasants. Vever looked puzzled and
answered: "We sell seedlings to the peasants." Ilyich asked him
no more questions, and when he had gone, looked at me ruefully
and said, "He doesn't understand the very question." He
afterwards became rather exacting towards Vever, who did not
understand that the state farm had to serve as a model of
efficient large-scale
farming for the peasants.</p><p>
One day, early in 1919, I received a visit at the Extra-School
Education Department from Balashov, an old pupil of mine at the
Sunday Evening School. He had worked in Nevskaya Zastava, and
later, during the period of reaction, had served two years in
prison. He told me that he had studied agriculture, especially
market-gardening, and now wanted to tackle the job. He united
seven peasant households (relatives) and organized a social
kitchen-garden, which they decided to work together without
hired labour. They organized an agricultural artel and grew fine
cabbages on it under contract with the Red Army. This
undertaking though did not survive. The Committee of Poor
Peasants took all the cabbages for themselves, and Balashov was
jailed. He wrote to me from prison. At Ilyich's request Dzerzhinsky sent men down to investigate the affair. It turned out that former detectives had wormed their way into the committee. Balashov was released, but the undertaking was dropped.</p><p>
Those market-gardening artels&mdash;they were fairly popular at
the time&mdash;came up against stiff resistance due to
underestimation of their significance. At Blagusha, for
instance, there were market-gardening courses organized by
A. S. Butkevich with an allotment garden attached to them. Our
Education Department supported those courses. In February 1919,
Butkevich's son, himself an agronomist and specialist on
market-gardening, organized on this allotment a sort of
cooperative society of trainees (most of them workers of the
Gnome &amp; Rom Factory and the Semyonov Mills) under whose rules
the crop was shared proportionately to the number of work hours
put in. Young Butkevich experimented with fertilizers, new
varieties and new methods of planting. The crop of vegetables
was
higher than at any of the other common allotments in the neighbourhood, and forty-five working-class families were provided with vegetables all the year round.</p><p>
The Extra-School Department supported this undertaking, but the
Moscow Education Department, which had a big say in things those
days, took the courses' allotment away on the grounds that
"providing some 45 or 50 families with vegetables was a matter
of trivial social significance compared with work organization
in the school." It failed at the time to appreciate the
propaganda value of collective forms of husbandry. The school
farm for the sake of which the Moscow Education Department had
appropriated this allotment was itself a failure.</p><p>
It is difficult today to imagine the obstacles which such undertakings found themselves up against in 1919. Those obstacles&mdash;and there were many of them&#151;are now forgotten, but the people who took part in those undertakings have hardly forgotten them. Vladimir Ilyich was particularly interested in such undertakings.</p><p>
To bring the peasant masses to identify themselves with the
organization of farms on collective lines required a long period
of preparatory work among the bulk of the peasantry. Ilyich was
being constantly made aware of this when he read letters from
peasants. One such letter concerning the situation in the
countryside (the letter is dated February-March 1919) has a
marginal note by Ilyich: "A cry far the middle peasant."</p><p>
The question of the attitude towards the middle peasant loomed large at the Eighth Congress of the Party (March 18-23, 1919). In his speech at the opening of the congress Ilyich formulated the issue with unmistakable clarity:</p><p>
"Implacable war against the rural bourgeoisie and the kulaks
brings to the forefront the task of organizing the proletariat
and semi-proletariat of the countryside. But for a party that
wishes to lay the solid foundations of a communist society the
next step is to correctly solve the question of our attitude
towards the middle peasants. This is a task of a higher
order. We were not able to deal with it on a broad basis until
the essential conditions of the Soviet Republic's existence were
assured."</p><p>
And further on:</p><p>
"We have entered such a phase of socialist construction when it
is necessary, on the basis of our experience in rural work, to
draw up concretely and in detail the basic rules and directions
by which we should be guided in order to fake a <em>firm stand
for alliance</em> in regard to our attitude towards the middle
peasants." (Works, Vol. 29, pp. 124-125.)</p><p>
At this congress Ilyich spoke about the necessity of a comradely approach to the middle peasant, about the impermissibility of using coercion, and about the necessity of assisting him, first and foremost in the matter of mechanizing farming processes, relieving and improving his economic position, and raising his standard of living and culture. Ilyich spoke a lot about raising the cultural level of the village, and about how we were constantly coming up against the stumbling block of insufficient culture among the masses. He spoke about the enforcement of Soviet laws being hampered by the low cultural level: "...Besides the law, there is a cultural level, which is subject to no laws." Remarking on certain limitations in the electoral rights of the peasantry, he said:</p><p>
"...As we point out, our Constitution was obliged to introduce
this inequality because the cultural level was low and because
with us organization was weak. But we do not make this an ideal;
on the contrary, in the programme the Party undertakes to work
systematically for the abolition of this inequality between the
more organized proletariat and the peasantry, an inequality we
shall have to abandon as soon as we succeed in raising the
cultural level. We shall then be able to get along without these
limitations." (Ibid., p. 163.)</p><p>
Now, when the countryside is collectivized, when the mechanization of agriculture has become a reality, when the village has reached a much higher level of education and culture, this directive of Ilyich's has become attainable. The new Constitution of the Soviet Union gives full and equal suffrage to both the workers and the peasants. Reading this Constitution makes one's heart beat faster; it is the fruit of long years of work, guided by the Party into the proper channels.</p><p>
A week after the Eighth Party Congress, at a meeting of the
All-Russian Central Executive Committee on March 30, 1919,
during which he proposed M.I. Kalinin as a candidate for the
post of Chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee
in place of the late Y. Sverdlov, Ilyich said that Kalinin had a
record of twenty years' Party work, that this St. Petersburg
worker, who was at the same time a peasant by origin from the
Tver Gubernia, had preserved close ties with peasant economy and
was constantly renewing and refreshing those ties, that he
showed a comradely approach to the broad masses of the working
people. The middle peasants would see in the person of the
highest representative of the Soviet Republic one of their own
people. The nomination of Kalinin would serve as a practical
means of organizing a number of direct contacts between the
highest representative of the Soviet power and the middle
peasants, would tend to bring them closer together.</p><p>
Ilyich's hopes, as we know, were completely fulfilled. Kalinin is extremely popular with the peasant masses, who love him.</p><p>
Ilyich's daily work showed what careful attention had to
be given to all questions that concerned the interests of the
middle peasant.</p><p>
The Skopin Uyezd Consultative Congress sent a delegation of three peasants to Ilyich on March 31, 1919, with instructions "to petition for the middle and lower-than-middle peasants to be relieved of the air tax," "to petition for the complete repeal of the milch cow mobilization, because there is only one milch cow left among our population per 8 to 10 persons, besides which we are suffering from violent epidemics of typhus, the Spanish flu and other such diseases, and milk is the only food product for the
sick. As to other products, such as butter and fats, these are completely lacking and unobtainable anywhere." The instructions also said something about horses and contained details of the tax collection.</p><p>
Ilyich booked through the "mandate," and without asking any
questions as to what the "air tax" could mean, he immediately
answered the peasants of the Skopin Uyezd to the point:</p><p>
"The imposition of a special tax on the peasants with incomes below the average is <em>unlawful,"</em> he wrote. "Steps have been taken to lighten the burden of taxation for the <em>middle</em> peasants. A decree will be issued in a day or two. On the other questions I shall immediately demand information from the People's Commissars. You will be duly informed.</p><p>
<em>"V. Ulyanov"</em></p><p>
April 5. 1919 <br> <em>(Lenin Miscellany,</em> XXIV, p. 44).</p><p>
He made a note for his Secretary on the peasants' letter:
"Remind me at C.P.C. to speak to <em>Sereda</em> and
<em>(Frumkin) Svidersky.</em> To be drafted by arrangement
between <em>P.C. of Agriculture</em> and <em>P.C. of Food
Supply."</em></p><p>
Ilyich demanded attention to the needs of the population on the part of all the administrative bodies.</p><p>
Lenin's solicitude for the children was strikingly manifested
during the famine that prevailed in 1919. The food situation
became critical in May. At the second meeting of the Economic
Commissium Ilyich raised the question of rendering relief in
kind to the children of the workers.</p><p>
Towards the end of May 1919 the situation got worse. There were lots of grain, thousands of tons of it, in the Ukraine, the Caucasus and in the East, but the civil war had cut off all communications, the central industrial districts were starving. The Commissariat of Education was swamped with complaints about there being nothing to feed the children with.</p><p>
On May 14, 1919, the army of the North-Western Government
launched an offensive against Petrograd. On May 15 General
Rodzyaako had taken Gdov, the Estonian and Finnish White Guard
troops started to advance, and fighting began at Koporskaya
Bay. Ilyich was concerned about Petrograd. It was characteristic
of him that at this very same time, on May 17, he put through a
decree for children to be fed free of charge. This decree
provided for the improvement of the food supply for children and
the welfare of the working people, and ordered that such
supplies should be issued free of charge to all children up to
14 irrespective of their parents' ration class. The decree
applied to the large industrial centres of sixteen
non-agricultural gubernias.</p><p>
June 12 brought news of the treachery of the Krasnaya Gorka garrison. On the same day Ilyich signed an order of the Council of People's Commissars extending the decree of May 17 concerning free food supplies for children to a number of other localities. The age limit was raised to 16 years.</p><p>
Red tape in the matter of rendering relief to the needy was
particularly hateful to Ilyich. On January 6, 1919, he wired to
the Cheka in Kursk:</p><p>
"Immediately arrest Kogan, member of the Yursk Central Purchasing Board, for not having helped 120 starving workers of Moscow and sent them away empty-handed. Publish it in newspapers and leaflets so that all employees of purchasing agencies and food supply authorities should know that formal and bureaucratic attitude and failure to help the starving workers will be severely punished, if need be&mdash;shot. Chairman of Council of People's Commissars LENIN." (Ibid., p. 168.)</p><p>
Ilyich took special care to have the People's Commissariats
stand as close to the worker and peasant masses and the Red Army
as possible.</p><p>
I was working at the Commissariat of Education, and saw evidences of Ilyich's keen interest in this matter at every step. Our Extra-School Department was visited by a mass of people&mdash;men and women workers, peasants, soldiers from the front, teachers and Party workers. Our Department became a sort of rendezvous to which Party people came to enquire about Ilyich and tell about their own work, to which workers came for advice as to how best to organize propaganda and agitation work, to which Red Army soldiers and commanders came, as well as workers who were closely ,associated with the village.</p><p>
I remember a young Red Army man complaining that
the wrong books were being sent them, that the newspapers did not reach them and that they had no propagandists. He demanded that more propagandists should go out. He was not the only one who came, of course, but that young fellow was so desperately earnest about it that he sticks in my memory.</p><p>
A young commander, newly arrived from the front, told us
agitatedly how his company, billetted in a <em>real</em> school
somewhere out west, had made short work of "masterclass"
culture. The real schools were privileged institutions. The Red
Army men had smashed up all the appliances and torn the
textbooks and exercise books to bits. "This is master-class
property," they said. On the other hand, their thirst for
knowledge was stronger than ever. There were no textbooks to be
had. The old textbooks with their prayers for the Tsar and the
Fatherland were destroyed by the Red Army men. They demanded
textbooks that
had a bearing on real life and on their own experiences.</p><p>
At the Extra-School Education Congress which Ilyich addressed a
resolution was passed calling on the delegates to go out to the
front. Many of them went along them was Elkina, an experienced
school-teacher. She went to the Southern Front. The Red Army men
asked to be taught to read and write. Elkina started giving them
lessons based on the analytic-synthetic method of the textbooks
then in use: "Masha ate <em>kasha </em>(porridge)," "Masha made
butter," etc. "What are you teaching us!" the Red Army men
started protesting. "Who the dickens is Masha? We don't want
to read that stuff!" And Elkina constructed her ABC lessons on
different lines: "We are not slaves, no slaves are we."</p><p>
It was a success. The Red Army men quickly learned to read and write. This was the very method of combining instruction with real life that Ilyich had been urging all the time. There was no paper to print new textbooks on. Elkina's textbook was printed on yellow wrapping paper, and in a note explaining her method Elkina described how to learn to write without using pen and ink. One has merely to recollect what paper the notice announcing the First Congress of the Third International was printed on to understand why Elkina wrote about this. It was not a case of failure to appreciate the role of the textbook. The Red Army men quickly learned to read and write by Elkina's ABC book.</p><p>
"...There cannot be the slightest doubt of the existence of a
tremendous thirst for knowledge and of tremendous progress in
education&mdash;mostly attained by means of extraschool
methods&mdash;of tremendous progress in educating the toiling
masses. This progress cannot be confined within any school
framework, but it is tremendous," Ilyich said at the Eighth
Party Congress. (Works, Vol. 29, p. 161.)</p><p>
Our
political-education workers Sergievskaya, Ragozinsky and others
visited the fronts. We received numerous letters from the
fronts. Here is an extract from the letter of a front-line
comrade, a Petrograd worker, who had cooperated with us in
organizing political-educational work in the district. "I have
just read the newspaper for the 7th reporting the opening of the
Congress on Extra-School Education," he wrote. "Yes, Nadezhda
Konstantinovna, when you travel the length and breadth of Soviet
Russia you see what a lot our Department has to do and how
needful this extra-school work is. I'm afraid I won't be able to
follow all the congress proceedings. I am waiting for a train
at station Inza to take me to station Nurlat. I have been
appointed inspector-instructor, and I am going to inspect the
27th Division. It's a big job, and the main thing, a new one
both in general and for me in particular. The recommendation
which Vladimir Ilyich has given me obliges me to fulfil the
trust in the best way I possibly can. Referring to that
recommendation, one comrade said: 'I'd give my life for such a
letter.' I'll write you when I've done the job. Give Vladimir
Ilyich and all my acquaintances my sincere regards. Army in the
Field. Political Department." </p><p>We had visitors from the
front as well as letters. Ilyich asked for the more interesting
visitors to be directed to him.</p><p>
Our Department devoted no less attention to explanatory work among the peasantry.</p><p>
The question of propaganda among the peasantry had long been
receiving the attention of Ilyich. We know what trouble he had
gone to in building up a popular literature and symposiums of
collected articles, and having a popular newspaper published for
the village (Bednota).</p><p>
On December 12, 1918, the Council of People's Commissar had issued a decree "On the Mobilization of Literate People and the Organization of Propaganda of the Soviet System." This decree called for the organization of readings of decrees and the most important articles and pamphlets in working-class districts, and especially in the villages. These readings were to have been organized first and foremost by our Department. Ilyich was a hard task-master. These readings were held; they awoke a desire for knowledge. "We're not going to take sides or join any party," the peasants of the Arzamas Uyezd told our agitator who went down there. "When we've learnt to read we'll read everything for ourselves, and then no one will be able to take us in."</p><p>
A section for work in the village was set up at the Eighth
Congress of the Party, in the name of which Ilyich made his
report. The section consisted of sixty-six delegates. Sereda,
Lunacharsky, Mitrofanov, Milyutin, Ivanov, Pakhomov, Vareikis,
Borisov and others were elected to the committee for drafting
the theses.</p><p>
All this goes to show what tremendous attention the Party and Ilyich devoted to this question.</p><p>
I remember with what interest Ilyich used to listen to
everything our Department succeeded in learning about the life
of the peasants and what their attitude was to one or another
question.</p><p>
A peasant of the Moscow Gubernia, who was working at some building site, once called on us for some books. He told us about the profiteering practised before the revolution among the army contractors, who had made fortunes out of the business. We directed him to Lunacharsky. He came back and told us: "He was very nice. He made me sit down on the sofa, while he walked up and down, up and down, speaking ever so well. He gave me some books. Promised to give me some vizool gadgets as well (visual aids.&mdash;N.R.). I'm afraid to take 'em, though. He says they won't cost anything, but I'm afraid I'll be taxed for those vizool things afterwards." Nevertheless he took away a collection of all kinds of placards and school aids. He became a frequent visitor at our Department. We called him the Vizool Gadget man. It is characteristic that Ilyich gave more attention to another incident related by this builder. It was about the school-teacher who lived in their village. She did not receive any salary, yet she did not give up her work at the school, and in the evenings gave lessons to the adults, whom she taught to read and write. The Vizool Gadget man told us that he had bought her a pair of boots, as her old ones were completely worn out.</p><p>
In 1919, many villages were still cut off from the rest of the
world. There was no radio in those days. The illiterate
population (in the Simbirsk Gubernia, where Ilyich was born,
eighty per cent of the population in 1919 was still illiterate)
did not read the newspapers&mdash;in fact, there weren't any
newspapers owing to the shortage of paper; the central
newspapers had a very restricted circulation for the same
reason, and never reached the villages. Book deliveries had not
been organized properly and the bookshops
sent out unbelievable stuff. The village was all agog for news of what was going on in the world, but its only source of information were rumours.</p><p>
Ilyich listened attentively to my stories about how the peasants
called on us with naive questions, how monstrously ill-informed
they were in regard to the practical measures of the Soviet
Government, its structure, their own rights and obligations,
what ignorance there was in the countryside, how naive their
illiterate letters were, letters penned for them by the village
"scholars" in a clerkly flourishing hand full of curlicues, and
how those free-lance scribes made them pay through the nose for
those letters.</p><p>
I showed the letters to Ilyich. He used to read them with
interest. He advised me to give more attention to the
organization of enquiry desks at our reading rooms and village
recreation halls. He had experience in consultation service in
exile in the village of Shushenskoye, where the peasants from
the neighbouring villages used to come to him every Sunday for
advice. In December 1918 he drafted rules of management for the
government offices, in which he urged the setting up of similar
local enquiry offices by the various government
departments. "These enquiry offices must not only give the
required information, both oral and in writing, but draw up
applications free of charge for the illiterate and those who are
unable to do so clearly," Ilyich wrote in his "Draft Rules of
Management for Soviet Institutions." (Works, Vol. 28, p. 327.)</p><p>"Rules concerning the days and hours of reception should
be posted up in every Soviet institution both inside and outside
in a manner accessible to all without passes. The reception room
should be so arranged that everyone should have free and easy
access to it without passes.</p><p>
"A book should be kept in every Soviet institution containing a brief record of the applicant's name, the gist of his request and to whom the matter has been directed.</p><p>
"On Sundays and holidays reception hours should be observed." (Ibid.)</p><p>
These draft rules were not published until 1928&mdash;ten years later, but Ilyich's directives were known to the Extra-School Department, and it was on his insistence that we began to pay greater attention to the organization of enquiry services at the reading rooms. The village librarians gained prestige as a result of this work, and in 1919 they were a definite influence in the countryside. Enquiry-desk work was linked with propaganda of the Soviet power, propaganda of the decrees issued by the Soviet Government.</p><hr class="end"><p>
Enquiry service was only one of the things Ilyich thought about. On April 12, 1919, a decree was published over the signatures of Kalinin, Lenh and Stalin, providing for the reorganization of the State Control (Stalin was then People's Commissar of State Control). This decree said:</p><p>
"The old bureaucracy has been destroyed, but the bureaucrats
remain. They have brought with them into the Soviet institutions
the spirit of conservatism and red tapery, inefficiency and loose
discipline.</p><p>
"The Soviet Government declares that it will not tolerate bureaucratism in whatever form, that it will banish it from Soviet offices by determined measures.</p><p>
"The Soviet Government declares that only the participation of
the broad masses of the workers and peasants in the
administration of the country and extensive controlovr the
organs of government' will eliminate the faults in the machinery
of state, will rid the Soviet institutions of the bureaucratic
evil and decidedly advance the cause of socialist
construction."</p><p>
On May 4, 1919, a decree was issued instituting a Central Bureau of Applications under the People's Commissariat of State Control, followed on ~May 24 by a decree instituting local branches of the Central Bureau.</p><p>
Ilyich urged an unremitting struggle against bureaucratism in Soviet offices.</p><p>
Bureaucratism with us in Russia was held up to ridicule in the literature of the sixties, especially by the <em>Iskra </em>(Chernyshevsky-ist) Poets. These poets (Kurochkin, Zhulev and others) had a strong influence on our generation. They branded all the numerous manifestations of bureaucratism, red tape and corruption. Verses by the <em>Iskra</em> poets and all kinds of anecdotes concerning red tape were a sort of folklore of the intellectuals during the sixties. Anna Ilyinichna and I were often reminded of that literature in recent years; she had an excellent memory. That literature was very popular in the Ulyanov family. Satire had done its work at the time by enabling our generation to suck in with their mother's milk, so to speak, a healthy hatred of bureaucratism. It was Ilyich's cherished desire to wipe that blemish off the face of the Soviet land.</p><p>
Ilyich himself was extraordinarily considerate towards people
and the letters that he received. This is borne out by the
documents published in <em>Lenin Miscellany,</em>;XXIV.</p><p>
Ilyich received a mass of complaints and he dealt with them himself.</p><p>
On February 22, 1919, he sent the following telegram to the
Yaroslavl Gubennia Executive Committee:</p><p>
"Soviet employee Danilov complains that the Cheka has confiscated from him three poods of flour and other products purchased during eighteen months on his work earnings for a family of four. Check most carefully. Wire me results.</p><p>
"Chairman, Council of People's Commissars</p><p>
 <em>Lenin"</em> <br><em>(Lenin Miscellany,</em> XXIV, pp. 171-72)</p><p>
Another telegram to the Gubernia Executive Committee of Gherepovets ran:</p><p>
"Check complaint Yefrosinia Yefimova, soldier's wife of village Novoselo, Pokrovsk Volost, Belozersk Uyezd, concerning confiscation of grain for common barn, although her husband has been prisoner of war over four years and she has family of three without a farm help. Report to me results investigation and your measures.</p><p>
"Chairman, Council of People's Commissars</p><p>
<em>Lenin"</em> <br>(Ibid., p. 173).</p><p>
Such instances could be cited by the hundred. I refer to those
kept in the Archives of the Lenin Institute, but how many more
are there that have not survived! In June 1919, when I went away
for a two months' trip on the Volga and the Kama on the
agitation steamboat <em>Krasnaya Zvezda,</em> Ilyich wrote to
me: "I read the letters addressed to you asking for assistance
and try to do what I can about it." When a person's mind is
engaged on some important problem, it is extremely difficult and
exhausting for him to switch over twenty times a day to all
kinds of petty affairs. The only time Ilyich could give his mind
up completely to any problem was when he took walks or went out
shooting. Comrades recollect how, in such cases, Ilyich would
unexpectedly utter some word or phrase which showed what his
mind was working on at the moment.</p><p>
Recollecting how Ilyich used to deal with "trifles," some comrades say: "We did not look after him properly, he was swamped by trivial affairs; we should not have troubled him with all those piddling affairs." That may be so, but Ilyich considered that attention to trivial details was extremely important, and that only such attention could make the Soviet administrative apparatus really democratic, not in a formal way, but in a proletarian democratic way.</p><p>
And, as he had previously done in the building up of the Party,
when he had tried, by personal example, to teach the comrades a
correct approach to the problems of agitation, propaganda and
organization so did he now, as head of the Soviet state,
endeavour to show how work should be carried on in the
government offices, how bureaucratism in every shape and form
should be banished from the machinery of the state, and that
machinery brought closer to the masses. His telegram to the
Novgorod Gubernia Executive Committee in June 1919 is
characteristic of him:</p><p>
"Apparently Bulatov has been arrested for complaining to me. I warn you that I shall have the chairmen of the gubernia executive committees, the Cheka and members of the executive committee arrested for this and see that they are shot. Why did you not answer my question immediately?</p><p>
"Chairman, Council of People's Commissars</p><p>
<em> Lenin"</em> </p><p><em>(Lenin Miscellany,</em> XXIV, p. 179).</p><p>
Ilyich tried to purge the machinery of the state of bureaucratism; he demanded a considerate attitude towards every person on the staff, demanded that those in charge should know their staffs, help them in their work and create the necessary facilities for efficient work. Ilyich constantly questioned me about the members of my own staff and got to know them; he advised me how to make better use of one or another worker. He constantly enquired what I was doing for them, how they were off for food, and how their children were faring. He studied the members of my staff, whelm he had never set eyes on, and I was sometimes surprised to find that he knew them better than I did.</p><p>
There are numerous records showing Ilyich's solicitude for the members of his own staff.</p><p>
At a meeting of the C.P.C. on March 8 Ilyich wrote the following note to his secretary concerning Khryashchova, a member of the Board of the Central Statistical Department:</p><p>
"If Khryashchova lives a long way and walks home, it's a
shame. Explain to her tactfully when opportunity offers that she
can leave earlier on the days when statistical questions do not
come up, or not come at all." (Ibid., p. 287.)</p><p>
Ilyich
showed particular concern for the living conditions of staff
workers. It was a time when even high-ranking officials and
their families did not have enough to eat. It transpired that
A. D. Tsyurupa, Markov of the Commissariat of Transport, and
others were starving.</p><p>
On August 8, 1919, Ilyich wrote the following letter to the Organizing Bureau of the Central Committee:</p><p>
"I have just received additional information from a
<em>reliable</em> source that Board members are
<em>starving</em> (for instance, Markov of the Commissariat of
Transport). I insist most energetically that the C. C. should:
1) order the Central Executive Committee to issue a grant of
5,000 rubles by way of relief to all Board members (and those of
equal position); 2) put them all permanently on <em>maximum</em>
quotas for specialists.</p><p>
"It is a shame, really&mdash;they are starving and their families are starving!!</p><p>
"100 to 200 people should be better fed." (Ibid., p. 317.)</p><hr class="end">
<p>
At the end of April a turning point was reached on the Eastern
Front. The Red Army began to score victories. Ufa and a number
of other towns were recaptured from the Whites. The offensive
against Ekaterinburg and Perm was developing successfully. At
the end of June the agitation steamboat <em>Krasnaya Zvezda</em>
was fitted out for a trip of the Volga as far as the Kama, then
up the Kama as far as possible, then dawn the Volga to the last
navigable place of safety. The task of the <em>Krasnaya
Zvezda</em> was to follow in the wake of the Whites land agitate
for the line adopted at the Eighth Party Congress, and
consolidate the Soviet power everywhere. The Political Commissar
on the <em>Krasnaya Zvezda</em> was V. Molotov. The boat was
equipped with a cinema and a printing plant and had radio and a
large stock of books. It was staffed by representatives of
various
Commissariats (I represented the Commissariat of Education) and the trade unions.</p><p>
Before sailing I had a long talk with Ilyich about what we had
to do, how to assist the population, what questions had to be
focussed on, and what things we had to study more
carefully. Ilyich would have liked to go himself but he could
not give up his work for a minute. On the eve of my departure we
talked all through the night. Ilyich went to the station to see
me off, and made me promise to write him regularly and talk with
him on the private line. I went up the Volga and the Kama as far
as Perm.</p><p>
Molotov was in charge of all the work. He got us together before each stop, and we discussed what we were going to do, what we were going to bay special stress on. After each stop we reported back on what we had done and compared notes. That trip was extremely useful to me. I had lots of things to talk to Ilyich about after that trip, and he listened to me with tremendous interest, going into every little detail.</p><p>
We held endless meetings during the trip, and addressed mass
meetings at the Bondyuzhsky Works, in Votkinsk, Motovilikha,
Kazan, Perm, Chistopol, Verkhniye Polyany, and so on. Our ship's
newspaper reckoned that I had addressed 34 meetings. I am no
orator, but the things I spoke to the men and women workers
about, to the Red Army men and the peasants, were things that
deeply agitated them and intimately concerned them. Wherever the
Whites had been, the hatred of the population towards them was
intense. I shall never forget the meeting at the Votkinsk Works,
where the Whites had shot almost all the teenagers&mdash;those
"accursed Bolshevik spawn" as they called them. The crowded mass
meeting sobbed to a man when we started singing the
revolutionary funeral march. There was hardly a family there
that had not had a son or daughter killed. Never shall I forget
the story of how partisan girls and school-teachers were flogged
to death, never shall I forget the countless outrages and acts
of violence which the peasants&mdash;mostly middle
peasants&mdash;living around the Kama told us about.</p><p>
The ignorance among the population was very great. Peasant women were still afraid to send their children to the nurseries. A furious agitation against the Soviet power was being conducted among the school-teachers. I saw an instance of that agitation at Chistopol. However, the close contact which the rural teachers had with the peasant and working-class masses induced many of them to side with the peasants and the workers. At the Izhevsk Works 95 out of 96 engineers had run away with Kolchak, but the wife of one of them, a school-teacher in Izhevsk and a former class-mate of mine at the high school, did not run away with her husband but remained with the Reds. "How could I leave the workers?" she said to me when we met.</p><p>
The privileged intellectuals sided with Kolchak at the time, and
went away with the Whites; our chief agitators were men and
women workers, and Red Army men. They stood close to the
masses. The Second Army had a rather peculiar agitator; he had
been a priest before the October Revolution, but after October
he became an agitator for the Bolsheviks. At a meeting of five
thousand Red Army men in Perm he spoke of the Soviet power's
intimate link with the masses. "The Bolsheviks," he said, "are
today's apostles." When asked by a Red Army man in the audience:
"What about baptism?" he answered: "That would take a couple of
hours to explain, but briefly it's pure eyewash!" The speeches
of the army commanders from among the workers were very
convincing. I told Ilyich about this meeting and how one
commander had said: "Soviet Russia is unconquerable on account
of its squarity and sizability." We laughed, but afterwards,
with the fall of the Hungarian Republic, Ilyich said that,
strictly speaking, that commander had been right&mdash;we had
room to manoeuvre in during the civil war.</p><p>
Azin, a Red Army commander, came to see me on the boat at Yelabug. He was a Cossack, ruthless to the Whites and deserters, a man of reckless daring. He spoke to me chiefly about the care he was taking of the Red Army men. His men loved him. I received a letter this year from a Red Army man who had fought Kolchak under him. Every line of the letter breathes of warm love for Azin. Recently Pastukhov, a member of the Central Executive Committee, related how a detachment of the Red Army under the command of Azin had suddenly burst into Izhevsk, which was still occupied by the Whites, riding horses whose manes were plaited with red ribbons, and captured the jail in which prisoners under sentence of death were kept (including Pastukhov's seventy-year-old father and his youngest eleven-year-old brother; Pastukhov's two other brothers had been killed at the front). Azin afterwards fell into the hands of the Whites on the Lower Volga and was tortured to death.</p><p>
The agitation of the <em>Krasnaya Zvezda</em> was very effective
in Tataria, where the population gave their fullest support to
the Soviet power.</p><p>
Vladimir Ilyich asked me about everything in full detail; he was particularly interested in what I told him about the Red Army, the temper of the peasants, of the Chuvashes and the Tatars, and about the growing trust towards the Soviet power among the masses.</p><hr class="end"><p>
The latter half of 1919 was much more difficult than the first. This especially applied to September, October and the beginning of November. The civil war was spreading. Kolchak had been defeated, but the Whites were bent on capturing the centres of the Soviet power&mdash;Moscow and Petrograd. Denikin started to advance from the south, where he had seized a number of important points in the Ukraine, and Yudenich began to advance from the west, and already stood at the approaches to Petrograd. The victories of the Whites encouraged the enemies who had been lying in hiding. At the end of November a counter-revolutionary organization connected with Yudenich and subsidized by the Entente was discovered in Petrograd.</p><p>
All the time that Denikin and Yudenich were winning Vladimir
Ilyich received a lot of anonymous letters of a threatening
character, some of them with caricatures. The intelligentsia was
still vacillating, and only the more progressive sections of it
headed by Timiryazev had gone over to the Soviets. The
Anarchists, supported by the Socialist-Revolutionaries, had
engineered a bomb explosion on the premises of the Moscow
Committee of the Party in Leontyevsky Street on September 25, in
which a number of our comrades were killed.</p><p>
Famine and poverty were rife. The Red Army had to be strengthened, its fighting spirit sustained, and plans for conducting the struggle at the battle fronts had to be thought out. The Red Army, the population and working class centres in the rear had to be supplied with grain, explanatory and agitation work had to be launched on a wide scale, and the whole administrative machinery had to be built up on new lines&mdash;not on the old bureaucratic lines, but along new Soviet lines, new cadres had to be selected and trained, one had to go into a mass of petty details.</p><p>
Although Ilyich's confidence in victory never weakened for a
moment, he worked from morning till night, and the tremendous
burden of all those cares gave him no sleep. He would get up in
the night and start ringing up on the telephone to check whether
this or that order of his had been carried out, or to send
another telegram somewhere. He spent most of his time in his
office, receiving people, and hardly stayed at home during the
day. I saw still less of him during those hectic months; we
almost stopped going out for walks together, and I did not like
going into his office on private matters for fear of
interrupting his work.</p><p>
The most acute problem was that of grain. The simple purchase of the required amount of grain under the existing conditions of small peasant holdings and wild speculation was simply unthinkable. Some kind of planning and system had to be introduced here, a number of laws enforced and suitable people mobilized for the purpose. It was not mere accident, therefore, that Alexander Tsyurupa was appointed People's Commissar of Food Supply on January 17, 1919. We had known him for a long time; I had bean in exile with him in Ufa.</p><p>
His father was a petty employee (secretary of the Town Council)
in Aleshki, Tavrida Gubernia. Alexander was born in 1870, the
same year as Ilyich. Theirs had been a large family of eight;
his father died early, his mother made a living by sewing, and
Alexander started giving lessons at an early age. He went to a
primary school, then the town school and the secondary
agricultural school. By profession he was an agronomist, and was
familiar with rural economy and peasant life. He was first
imprisoned for being a revolutionary in 1893, and was arrested
again in 1895. Beginning from 1897 he worked as a statistician
in Ufa. There he belonged to a group of Social-Democrats who did
active work among the railway workers and the workers of the
neighbouring factories. We had worked together there. He met
Ilyich once or twice in Ufa when Ilyich came to see me, and
afterwards we regularly corresponded. He wrote for
<em>Iskra.</em> We knew him as a convinced ardent
revolutionary. In 1901 he had organized a May Day strike in
Kharkov, and in 1902 had worked in Tula in a group of which
Sophia Smidovich, Weresayev and Lunacharsky's brother had been
members. In 1902 he was arrested in Samara, and 1905 found him
working again in Ufa.</p><p>
Beginning from 1914 Tsyurupa began to take an active part again in revolutionary Bolshevik work. Ilyich, who was an excellent judge of people, thought very highly of him. He was an extremely modest man, neither orator nor writer, but a splendid organizer, a practical man who knew his business and was familiar with the village. At the same time he was a splendid revolutionary, who was not afraid of difficulties, and threw himself wholeheartedly into the job of whose significance he was fully aware. He worked under the direction of Ilyich, who appreciated him, took care of his health. Seeing him tired and overworked Ilyich, half in jest, half in earnest, reprimanded him for not taking proper care of "state property" (our domestic slang term for devoted Communists). Ilyich liked Alexander Tsyurupa as a comrade too.</p><p>
The Soviet Government's food policy at the time consisted in the
organization of a grain monopoly, that is, prohibition of all
private trade in grain, compulsory deliveries of surplus grain
to the state at fixed prices, the prohibition of hoarding,
strict stock-taking of all surpluses of grain, the proper
transportation of grain from places where there was a surplus to
places where there was a shortage, and the laying in of stocks
for consumption and sowing. Strictly speaking, this was a
section of planned economy, socialist economy, but it had to be
practised under conditions when the very foundations of that
economy had not yet been reorganized, when peasant farming still
remained uncollectivized.</p><p>
On July 29-30, 1919, the Moscow Soviet and the Moscow Trade-Union Council called a conference of factory committees, representatives of trade-union head offices, delegates of the Moscow Central Workers' Cooperative Society, and the "Kooperatsia" Society Council to organize a united consumers' society in Moscow. The conference was attended also by Mensheviks and supporters of the independent cooperative movement. Vladimir Ilyich spoke at this conference on July 30; he wished the conference success in its work, but stressed that everything depended upon whether we would win the civil war and remodel the social system on new lines, as only this could give the cooperative movement the right direction.</p><p>
He said that it was only twenty months since the October
Socialist Revolution had taken place, and, naturally, that was
too short a time in which to remodel the whole social
system. Ilyich said that it was necessary to get the better not
only of the old institutions, not only of the landowners and the
capitalists, but also of the old habits bred by capitalism and
the conditions of small peasant economy, habits which had grown
into the very bones of the petty proprietor in the course of
centuries.</p><p>
Today, when collective farming has become the predominant form of agriculture in our country, everyone understands what Lenin had been driving at. He had talked about replacing individual farming by collective farming. He said that a last and decisive battle was being waged between capitalism and socialism, that only the victory of socialism could help once and for all do away with hunger, exploitation, and the profiting of one from the labour of another. He spoke about the Bolsheviks having started on the path of socialist grain collection for supplying the Red Army and the working-class population. These grain purchases during the first year amounted to only thirty million poods.</p><p>
"The next year," said Ilyich, "we laid in over 107 million
poods, despite the fact that we had been much worse off in a
military respect and in respect of free access to the richer
grain-producing territories, as we were cut off effectively from
the Ukraine and the greater part of the south as well as
Siberia. Nevertheless, as you see, our grain purchases have
trebled. From the point of view of the work of our food supply
organizations this is a great success, but from the point of
view of providing the nonagricultural areas with grain this is
very little, because when a careful check-up of food conditions
among the nonagricultural population and, especially, the
working-class population in the towns, was made, it was
discovered that in the spring and summer of this year the worker
in the towns received approximately only half his food from the
People's Commissariat of Food Supply and was obliged to get the
rest on the free market and from profiteers, paying in the first
case only a tenth of all his expenses, and in the latter case
nine-tenths. The profiteers, as may have been expected, are
making the worker pay nine times more than the price the state
charges for this bread. Considering these exact data showing our
food situation, we must admit that we are still half in old
capitalism, with one foot there, and have only half climbed out
of this morass, this quagmire of profiteering and taken the
<em>path of really socialist collections of grain,</em> when
grain has ceased to be a commodity, an object of profiteering
and an object and cause for squabbling, for fighting, and for
the impoverishment of many."</p><p>
Ilyich went on to
say:</p><p>
"A decisive and final struggle is now going on against capitalism and free trade, and for us it is now a battle royal between capitalism and socialism. If we win this fight there will be no return any more to capitalism and the old order, to all that has been." (My italics.-N.K.) (Works, Vol. 29, pp. 481-82, 487.)</p><p>
In a number of speeches made in 1919 Ilyich explained to the
working men and women, the peasants and Red Army men the meaning
and significance of the Soviet Government's food policy and
spoke about collective farming. Experience has confirmed the
correctness of the policy that was then pursued.</p><p>
Besides his concern for providing grain for the Red Army Ilyich was constantly thinking how to strengthen the ranks of the Red Army and raise its discipline. He believed that the best way of doing this was to reinforce the ranks of the Red Army, made up mostly of peasants, with workers. That is why he so warmly greeted the Petrograd workers who were going to the front, into the thick of the fight, and he greeted the Moscow workers for the same reason. He relied upon the workers, attached tremendous importance to their advancement to posts of authority in the capacity of commissars and army commanders. He called upon the Red Army men to be unremittingly vigilant. In a letter to the workers and peasants in connection with the victory over Kolchak, Ilyich warned:</p><p>
"...The landlords and capitalists have not been destroyed and do
not consider themselves vanquished; every intelligent worker and
peasant sees, knows and realizes that they have only been beaten
and have gone into hiding, are lying low, very often disguising
themselves by a 'Soviet' ',protective' colouring. Many landlords
have wormed their way into state farms, and capitalists into
various 'chief administrations' and 'centres,' acting the part
of Soviet officials; they are watching every step of the Soviet
Government for it to make a mistake or show weakness, so as to
overthrow it, to help the Czechoslovaks today and Denikin
tomorrow.</p><p>
"Everything must be done to track down these bandits, these landlords and capitalists who are lying low, and to ferret them out, <em>no matter what guise they take,</em> to expose them and punish them ruthlessly, for they are the worst foes of the working people, skilful, shrewd and experienced, who are patiently waiting for an opportune moment to set a conspiracy going; they are saboteurs, who stop at no crime to injure the Soviet power. We must be merciless towards these enemies of the working people, towards the landlords, capitalists, saboteurs and Whites.</p><p>
"And in order to be able to catch them we must be skilful,
careful and class-conscious, we must watch out most attentively
for the least disorder, for the slightest deviation from the
conscientious observance of the laws of the Soviet power. The
landlords and capitalists are strong not only because of their
knowledge and experience and the assistance they get from the
richest countries in the world, but also because of the force of
habit and the ignorance of the broad masses, who want to live in
the 'good old way' and do not realize how essential it is that
the laws of the Soviet power be strictly and conscientiously
observed." (Works, Vol. 29, pp. 514-15.)</p><p>
This call for vigilance frightened many people. Many a story was
told to Ilyich of how the Red Army men sometimes dealt with one
or another capable commander only because he was "one of the
gentry," or because some order of his was not to their liking,
or on some other trivial excuse. All this was told to Ilyich
with a sneer, as much as to say: "There are your fine Red Army
men for you!"</p><p>
Of course, there were many cases of men
being blamed not for what they ought to be blamed, or blamed for
something someone else had done; people were prevented from
seeing things right by lack of knowledge, by the
small-proprietor criterion of what was good and what was bad, by
an anarchic approach to a number of questions. Ilyich kept hard
at us educational workers, demanding that we should develop
wider educational activities among the adult workers, peasants
and Red Army men, that we should not handle this business
in a formal official manner, but should broaden the horizon of
our adult pupils, infuse the spirit of Party into all our
teaching. He demanded that we should by every means in our power
open the door to higher education to those for whom it had been
previously closed.</p><p>
It was in 1919 that a number of decrees were issued throwing open for all the door to the higher educational institutions. Workers' Faculties were organized, numerous workers' courses were set up, and the first Soviet-Party School was organized in 1919.</p><p>
I would come to Ilyich&mdash;at the end of 1919 he looked very
bad (there is a photo of him going to the courses, which shows
how bad he looked&mdash;worn out and harassed) &#151;and he would
sit there silent. I knew that all I had to do to take him out of
himself was to tell him something about the life of the Workers'
Faculty students or the Soviet-Party School. And there was
plenty to tell him about. He was interested in hearing how
people were becoming more socially alert, how they were
increasingly becoming aware of the tasks that faced them. We
discussed the subject a good deal.</p><p>
A Party Week was organized in Petrograd between August 10 and 17; at the same time, in accordance with the ruling of the Eighth Party Congress, a re-registration of Party members was carried out, which lasted till the end of September. Between October 8 and 15 a Party Week was held in Moscow.</p><p>
On October 11 Ilyich wrote his article "The Workers' State and
Party Week" which gave a forceful expression of his views on the
Party, on what the new government apparatus should be, and how
important it was to staff it with as many workers and peasants
as possible.</p><p>
"Party Week in Moscow falls at a difficult time for the Soviet power," Ilyich wrote in that article. "Denikin's successes have given rise to a frenzied increase of plotting on the part of the landlords, capitalists and their friends, and increased efforts on the part of the bourgeoisie to sow panic and undermine the strength of the Soviet system by every means in their power. The vacillating, wavering, ignorant petty bourgeois, and with them the intelligentsia, the Socialist-Revolution aries and Mensheviks, have, as is usually the case, become more wobbly than ever and were the first to allow themselves to be intimidated by the capitalists.</p><p>
"But the fact that Party Week in Moscow falls at such a
difficult time is, I think, rather an advantage to us, for it is
much better for the cause. We do not need Party Week for show
purposes. We do not need fictitious Party members even as a
gift. Our Party, the party of the revolutionary working class,
is the only government party in the world which is concerned not
in increasing its membership but in improving its quality, and
in purging itself of 'self-seekers.' We have more than once
carried out re-registration of Party members in order to get rid
of these 'self-seekers' and to leave in the Party only
politically enlightened elements who are sincerely devoted to
communism. We have taken advantage of the mobilizations for the
front and of the subbotniks to purge the Party of those who are
only 'out for' the benefits accruing to membership of a
government party and do not want to bear the burden of
self-sacrificing work for communism.</p><p>
"And at this juncture, when intensified mobilization for the front is in progress, Party Week is a good thing because it offers no temptation to the self-seekers. We extend a broad invitation into the Party only to the rank-and-file workers and to the poor peasants, to the labouring peasants, but not to the peasant profiteers. We do not promise and do not give these rank-and-file members any advantages from joining the Party. On the contrary, just now harder and more dangerous work than usual falls to the lot of Party members.</p><p>
"All the better. Only sincere supporters of communism, only
persons who are conscientiously devoted to the workers' state,
only honest working people, only genuine representatives of the
masses that were oppressed under capitalism, will join the
Party.</p><p>
"And it is only such members that we need in the Party.</p><p>
"We need new Party members not for advertisement purposes but
for serious work. These are the people we invite into the
Party. To the working people we throw its doors wide open."
(Works, Vol. 30, pp. 45-46.)</p><p>
Further Ilyich repeated what he had said at the funeral of Sverdlov&mdash;that there were many talented organizers and administrative workers among the working class and the peasantry. It was to these that he appealed to tackle socialist construction.</p><p>
"If you are sincere supporters of communism, set about this work
boldly, do not fear its novelty and the difficulty it entails,
do not be put off by the old prejudice that only those who have
received a formal training are capable of this work." (Ibid.,
pp. 46-47.)</p><p>
The article ended with the words: "The mass of the working people are with us. That is where our strength lies. That is the source of the invincibility of world communism." Ilyich, in those difficult times, ceaselessly appealed to the workers and the Red Army men in speeches and articles. His words roused them. The workers of Yaroslavl, Vladimir and Ivanovo-Voznesensk went to the front en masse.</p><p>
"The power of the workers' and peasants' <em>sympathy</em> for
their vanguard," wrote Ilyich, "was <em>itself</em> sufficient
to <em>work wonders.</em></p><p>
"It is indeed a miracle: the workers who have experienced the untold torments of hunger, cold and economic ruin have not only kept their spirit up, preserved all their devotion to the Soviet power, all their energy of self-sacrifice and heroism, but are taking upon themselves, despite their unpreparedness and inexperience, the burden of steering the ship of state! And this at a time when the storm has reached a furious pitch.</p><p>
"The history of our proletarian revolution is full of such
miracles. Such miracles will lead certainly and
positively&mdash;whatever the separate painful ordeals may
be&mdash;to the complete victory of the world Soviet Republic."
(Works, Vol. 30, pp. 53-54.)</p><p>
The young people, too, were eager to go to the front. We political-education workers were busy at the time with the first Soviet-Party School, at which we tried to give the young people not a "formal" training, of which Ilyich so sharply disapproved, but knowledge that would equip them to grasp and meet the events they were living through. We were awfully glad when Ilyich came to address the graduates of the first Soviet-Party School on October 24, 1919.</p><p>
"Comrades," he began. "You know that what has brought us here
together today is not only a desire to celebrate the graduation
by most of you at the course at the Soviet school but also the
fact that about half of all the graduates have decided to go to
the front in order to give fresh, extraordinary and substantial
aid to the troops who are fighting there."</p><p>
After describing the difficult situation at the fronts without any attempt to gloss it over, Ilyich went on: "That is why, hard though this sacrifice is&mdash;the sending to the front of hundreds of graduates who are so badly needed for work in Russia&#151;we have nevertheless consented to grant your wish." (Ibid., pp. 57, 62.)</p><p>
Ilyich then went on to describe the work that confronted the Soviet-Party School graduates:</p><p>
"To those who are going to the front as representatives of the workers and peasants there can be no choice. Their slogan should be&mdash;death or victory. Each of you should be able to approach the most backward and undeveloped Red Army men in order to explain the situation to them in the plainest language from the standpoint of the working man, help them at a time of difficulty, remove all vacillations, teach them to combat the numerous manifestations of sabotage, inertia, deceit or treachery. You know that there are still many such manifestations in our ranks and among the commanders. This is where we need men who have gone through a course of training, who understand the political situation and are in a position to help the broad masses of the workers and peasants in their fight with treachery or sabotage. Besides personal bravery, the Soviet power looks to you to render the utmost assistance to the masses, to put a stop to all vacillations among them, and prove to them that the Soviet power has forces to which it resorts whenever it is in difficulties." (Ibid.,pp. 63-64.)</p><p>
The Soviet-Party School graduates justified the confidence placed in them.</p><p>
Ilyich's speech was also a programme for all our political-education workers.</p><p>
It was not only at public meetings that Ilyich spoke about
what was uppermost in his mind. He spoke about it at home, too,
especially when close comrades visited us. At the end of 1919 a
frequent visitor was Inessa Armand, with whom Ilyich liked to
discuss the prospects of the movement. Inessa's daughter had
been at the front, and had narrowly escaped being killed during
the bomb outrage in Leontyevsky Street on September 25. I
remember Inessa coming to us once with her youngest daughter,
Varya, who was quite a young girl at the time and afterwards
became a staunch member of the Party. Ilyich liked to indulge in
day-dreaming in their presence; I remember how Varya's eyes used to sparkle. He liked to chat with our domestic help Olimpiada Zhuravlyova, mother of the woman writer Boretskaya. Zhuravlyova had previously worked in the Urals as an unskilled worker at an ironworks and afterwards as office cleaner at<em> Pravda.</em> Ilyich thought she had a strong proletarian instinct. Sitting in the kitchen (by force of old habit he liked to have his meals in the kitchen), Ilyich liked to talk with her about the future victories.</p><p>
Ilyich was not mistaken&mdash;we celebrated the second
anniversary of the Soviet power with victories.</p><p>
When Denikin at the beginning of October threatened Orel, the Central Committee of the Party sent Stalin to the Southern Front as a member of the Revolutionary Military Council. Stalin proposed a new plan for an offensive, which was adopted by the Central Committee. Vladimir Ilyich fully supported it. Things at the Southern Front quickly took a turn for the better. On October 19 our troops dealt a crushing blow to generals Shkuro and Mamontov at Voronezh. On the 20th Orel was recaptured, and on October 21 the Pulkovo battles inaugurated the defeat of Yudenich, who had been advancing on Petrograd.</p><p>
On the anniversary of the October Revolution Ilyich sent ardent
greetings to the workers of Petrograd, wrote an article in
<em>Pravda </em>"The Soviet Power and Women's Position", and an
article for the peasants in <em>Bednota </em>"Two Years of
Soviet Power."</p><p>
On November 7, Ilyich addressed a joint meeting of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, the Moscow Soviet, the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions, and factory-committee delegates on the subject of "Two Years of Soviet Power." Ilyich did not like speaking at ceremonial meetings, and his speech at this one was a purely business-like speech without any propaganda. It was none the less a stirring speech, which roused enthusiasm and a storm of applause.</p><p>
Ilyich said that the most important achievement of the Soviet
power during the past two years had been "the lesson at building
up the workers' state ... the workers' participation in running
the state." "...The most important job that we did was that of
remodelling the old machinery of state, and hard though this
work was, we see the results of the efforts of the working class
in the course of two years and can say that in this field we
have thousands of representatives of the workers who have been
through the whole fire of struggle, ousting the representatives
of the bourgeois state step by step. We see workers not only at
the state apparatus, we see their representatives in the food
supply business, a sphere that was dominated almost exclusively
by representatives of the old bourgeois government, the old
bourgeois state. The workers have created a food supply
apparatus."</p><p>
The percentage of workers on the government staffs rose from thirty to eighty in 1919.</p><p>
The most important task of all that was being handled, Ilyich
said, was that of making leaders of the proletariat. They were
being made at the front, in all fields of administrative
activity. Ilyich stressed the role of the subbotniks, the
importance of enrolling workers into the Party. In Moscow alone
as many as over fourteen thousand new members of the Party were
enrolled during Party Week. Ilyich spoke about the reserves we
had in the person of the worker and peasant youth, who had been
reared under the conditions of active struggle. But the main
thing to which attention had to be paid, Ilyich said, was the
building up of proper relations with the peasant millions, the
necessity of conducting a wide explanatory campaign among the
peasantry. He spoke about how the civil war was opening the eyes
of the peasantry to the true state of affairs. Ilyich spoke
calmly. The general mood was one of elation.</p>
<p>
Mayakovsky, who was then popular with the political-education workers, expressed this mood in his poem dedicated to the second anniversary of the October Revolution:</p>
<p class="indentb">Let it be by a drop,<br>
by two,<br>
merge your spirits in world-wide fusion<br>
to boost<br>
by everything each can do<br>
the workers' exploit<br>
called<br>
Revolution!<br>
Congratulators<br>
don't knock at the door? <br>
shrivelling up<br>
with fear?<br>
What the hell do we need them for?<br>
What's ten?<br>
We'll come<br>
to our hundredth year.</p>
<p>
When we celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the October
Revolution, and summed up the achievements on the front of
socialist construction as recorded in the new Constitution of
the Soviet Union, we all thought of Ilyich, of Ilyich's words
and directives.</p>
