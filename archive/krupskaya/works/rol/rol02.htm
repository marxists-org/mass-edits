<p>
I went out to Minusinsk at my own expense, accompanied by my
mother.We arrived in Krasnoyarsk on the first of May, 1898, whence
we had to go up the Yenisei by boat. Navigation, however, had not
started yet. In Krasnoyarsk I made the acquaintance of the
Narodopravets Tyutchev and his wife, who, being experienced people
in these matters, arranged a meeting for me with a party of
Social-Democrat exiles who were passing through Krasnoyarsk. Among
them were two comrades &#8211; Lengnik and Silvin, who had been charged
with me in the same case. The soldiers brought the exiles down to
be photographed and sat a little way of, munching the bread and
sausage with which we had treated them.</P>
<P>
In Minusinsk I went to see Arkady Tyrkov &#8211; one of the First of
Marchers, banished permanently to Siberia &#8211; to give him regards
from his sister, an old school friend of mine. I also went to
see Felix Kohn, the Polish comrade, who had been sentenced to
penal servitude in 1885 in connection with the "Proletariat"
case and had had a very hard time in prison and exile. He had
for me the aura of an old intransigent, and I liked him
tremendously.</P>
<p>
It was dusk when we arrived in Shushenskoye, where Vladimir
Ilyich lived. He was out hunting. We unloaded and were shown into
the cottage. In the Minusinsk district of Siberia the peasants
live in very clean log-built cottages. The floors are covered with
bright home-woven carpet strips, and the walls are whitewashed and
decorated with branches of the Siberian fir. Vladimir Ilyich's
room, though small, was spotlessly clean. My mother and I were
given the rest of the cottage. Our landlord's family and all the
neighbours crowded in and looked us over and questioned us with
great curiosity. At last Vladimir Ilyich returned from the
hunt. He was surprised to see a light in his room. The landlord
told him that Oscar Engberg (an exiled St. Petersburg worker) had
come in drunk and?thrown all his books about. Ilyich ran up the
steps. Just then I came out on the porch and we met. We had a good
long talk that night.</P>
<p>
There were only two other exiles in Shushenskoye, both
workers. One was a Social-Democrat Prominski, a Polish hat-maker
from Lodz, with a wife and six children, the other was a Putilov
worker named Oscar Engberg, of Finnish nationality. Both were very
good comrades. Prominski was a calm, steady man with a very firm
character. He read and knew little, but his class instinct was
strikingly developed. His attitude towards his wife, then still a
religious woman, was one of tolerant amusement. He was very good
at singing Polish revolutionary songs, such as Ludu roboczy,
poznaj swoje si1y, Pierwszy maj and others. The children joined in
the chorus, and so did Vladimir Ilyich, who sang a lot in Siberia
and obviously enjoyed it. Prominski also sang Russian
revolutionary songs, which Vladimir Ilyich had taught
him. Prominski planned to go back to Poland to work, and
slaughtered a little army of hares to make fur coats for the
children. He never got back to Poland, though. He just moved a bit
nearer to Krasnoyarsk with his family and got a job there on the
railway. The children grew up. He became a Communist, his wife
turned Communist, too, and so did the children. One of them was
killed in the war, another barely escaped with his life during the
Civil War, and is now in Chita. Prominski did not leave for Poland
until 1923, but he died on the way from typhus.</P>
<p>
The other worker, Oscar, was a different type altogether. He
was a young man, who had been deported for taking part in a strike
and behaving violently in the course of it. He had read a lot of
all-sorts, but had only the faintest of ideas about socialism. He
came back from a trip to the volost once and said: "A new clerk
has arrived &#8211; he and I have the same convictions." "Meaning?" said
I. "We are both against revolution," he answered. Vladimir Ilyich
and I were just flabbergasted. The next day I sat down with him to
study <EM>The Communist Manifesto</EM> (I had to translate it from
the German), and when that was mastered, we passed on to
<EM>Capital</EM>. During one of our lessons Prominski came in, and
sat puffing at his pipe. I asked Oscar a question in connection
with what we had been reading, but he could not answer
it. Prominski answered it for him with calm smiling ease. Oscar
dropped his lesson; for a whole week after that. He was a good
fellow, though. There were no other political exiles in
Shushenskoye. Vladimir Ilyich said he had tried to strike up an
acquaintance with the school-teacher, but nothing had come of
it. The teacher was drawn towards the local aristocracy, that is,
the priest and a couple of shopkeepers. Their only pastime was
playing cards and drinking. The teacher had no interest whatever
in social problems. Prominski's eldest son Leopold, who was
already socialist-minded, was always arguing with him.</P>
<P>Vladimir Ilyich had a peasant of his acquaintance whom he was
very fond of. He was Zhuravlyov, a consumptive man of about
thirty. This Zhuravlyov had formerly been the village
clerk. Vladimir Ilyich called him a revolutionary by nature, a
protestant. Zhuravlyov came out boldly against the rich and would
not put up with the slightest injustice. He was always
travelling somewhere, and shortly died from consumption.</P>
<p>
Another acquaintance of Ilyich's was a poor peasant, with whom
he often went out shooting. He was the simplest of
fellows &#8211; Sosipatych, his name was. He thought a lot of Vladimir
Ilyich, though, and used to give him ail kinds of odd
presents. Once it was a live crane, once some cedar cones.</P>
<p>
Through Sosipatych and Zhuravlyov Vladimir Ilyich studied the
Siberian village. He told me once of a talk he had had with a
well-to-do peasant in whose house he had lived. The man's farm
labourer had stolen some hides from him. The peasant overtook
him at a brook and finished him off. Ilyich in this connection
spoke about the insensate cruelty of the petty proprietor, and his
ruthless exploitation of his farm-hands. Indeed, the Siberian
farm labourers worked like cart horses, and never got enough sleep
except on holidays.</P>
<p>
Ilyich had yet another method of studying the village. On
Sundays he gave free legal advice. His reputation as a lawyer rose
high after he had helped a gold-mine worker, who had been given
the sack, to win his suit against his employer. The news of this
success spread quickly among the peasants, and men and women came
to Ilyich with their troubles. He heard them out attentively,
went deeply into the matter and then gave his advice. Once a
peasant came twenty versts to ask how he could prosecute his
brother-in-law for not having invited him to his wedding, at which
everyone had had a good time. "Will your brother-in-law treat you
to a drink if you go and see him now?" "Aye, that he will."
Vladimir Ilyich wasted an hour, trying to persuade the fellow to
make it up with his brother-in-law. Sometimes you couldn't make
head or tail of what they were talking about, and so Vladimir
Ilyich always asked them to bring him a copy of the various papers
in the case. Once a bull belonging to a rich farmer gored a poor
woman's cow. The volost court ordered the owner to pay the woman
ten rubles. The woman refused to accept the decision and demanded
a "copy" of all the evidence in the case. "What do you want, a
copy of a white cow?" the assessor said, laughing at her. The
enraged woman came running to Vladimir Ilyich. Sometimes it was
enough for the wronged party to threaten to take his complaint to
Vladimir Ilyich to make the offender give in.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich made a good study of the Siberian
village. Till then he had known the Volga villages. Once he told
me: "My mother wanted me to go in for farming. I started, but then
I saw it was no good. My relations with the peasants became
abnormal."</P>
<p>
Strictly speaking, Vladimir Ilyich had no right as an exile to
handle legal affairs, but those were liberal times in
Minusinsk. Practically, surveillance did not exist.</P>
<p>
The assessor &#8211; a local well-to-do peasant &#8211; was more concerned
with selling us his veal than in seeing that "his" exiles did not
run away. Life was surprisingly cheap in Shushenskoye. Vladimir
Ilyich's monthly allowance of eight rubles procured him clean
lodgings, and meals, and paid for laundry and mending &#8211; and even
that was considered dear. True, the dinner and supper were simple
enough meals. One week a sheep would be slaughtered, and Vladimir
Ilyich would be fed with it day in day out until it was all
gone. Then they would buy meat for a week, and the servant girl
would chop it up for cutlets out in the yard in a trough used for
preparing the cattle feed. These cutlets were fed to Vladimir
Ilyich for a whole week. But there was milk and cream enough for
both Vladimir Ilyich and his dog, a fine Gordon setter named
Zhenka, whom he taught to retrieve, and point, and do all other
kinds of canine tricks.</P>
<p>
As the Ziryanovs &#8211; our landlord's family-often had drinking
parties at which the men used to get drunk, and as home life there
was in many ways inconvenient, we shortly moved to another place,
renting half a cottage with a vegetable garden for four rubles a
month. We set up on our own. In the summer it was impossible to
get anyone to help about the house. Mother and I tackled the
Russian stove between us. Sometimes I would knock over the
dumpling soup with the oven-fork, and upset the dumplings all
over the coals. But I got used to it in time. We had all kinds of
stuff growing in the garden &#8211; cucumbers, carrots, beetroots,
pumpkins and what not. I was very proud of my little vegetable
garden. Vladimir Ilyich and I had also made an orchard in the
yard, fetching hops from the woods for the purpose. In October we
got a girl-help &#8211; a skinny lass of thirteen with bony elbows named
Pasha, who quickly took things in hand. I taught her to read and
write, and she decorated the walls with specimens of my mother's
instructions: "Neva waste eny tee," and kept a diary in which she
made notes such as: "Oscar Engberg and Prominski came. They sang
'stump' and so did I."</P>
<p>
I remember how we celebrated the First of May.</P>
<p>
Prominski called in the morning, looking very festive in a
clean collar and tie, and himself shining like a new penny. His
mood quickly infected us, and we all three went to Oscar Engberg,
taking the dog Zhenka with us. Zhenka ran on ahead, yapping
joyfully. We walked along the bank of the River Shusha. The ice
had broken up and was drifting down the stream. Zhenka waded into
the icy water and defied the shaggy Shushenskoye watchdogs to
follow his example.</P>
<p>
Oscar was excited at our coming. We all sat down in his room and began singing together:</P>
<P class="index"><EM>It's come, the merry First of May!<BR>
And let no sorrow bar its way.<BR> 
Let songs ring out, sing loud and gay, <BR>
We'll have a jolly strike today <BR>
Police arrive with no delay,<BR> 
To prove they're worth their dirty pay:<BR>
Put us behind the bars, would they. <BR>
Police be damned! Is all we say, <BR>
And meet our May Day bold and gay.<BR>
Hooray, Hooray <BR>
For merry May!</EM></P>
<P>Having sung the song in Russian, we sang it in Polish, and
decided to celebrate May Day out in the fields after dinner. That
is what we did. There were six of us in the field &#8211; Prominski took
his two little boys along with him. He was as radiant as
ever. Stepping on to a dry mound in the field, Prominski pulled a
red handkerchief out of his pocket, laid it out on the ground and
stood on his head. The children squealed with delight. In the
evening we all got together at our place and sang songs
again. Prominski's wife came too. My mother and Pasha also joined
in the chorus.</P>
<p>
That night Ilyich and I could not fall asleep for thinking of
the huge workers' demonstrations in which we would some time take
part.</P>
<P>
There was a childish element too. A Lettish settler, a felt-boot
maker by trade, lived across the way. He had had fourteen
children, but only one survived &#8211; Minka. The father was an
inveterate drunkard. Minka, who was six, was grave of speech,
with a wan little face and bright eyes. He came to see us every
day. We would hardly be up when the door would bang, and a small
figure appear in a big cap and his mother's warm jacket with a
scarf wrapped round him, exclaiming gladly: "It's me!" He knew
that my mother doted on him, and Vladimir Ilyich would always
say something funny and play with him. </P>
<P>Minka's mother would come running in.</P>
<P>"Darling, have you seen a ruble lying about?" she said.</P>
<p>
"Yes, I saw it on the table, so I put it in the box." </P>
<P>When we went away Minka fell ill with grief. He is dead now,
and his father wrote asking to be given a bit of land across the
Yenisei &#8211; "as I'd like to be able to have enough to eat in my old
age."</P>
<p>
Our household kept growing. Our latest acquisition was a kitten.</P>
<p>
First thing in the morning Vladimir Ilyich and I would sit
down to the Webb translation, which Struve had got for me. After
dinner we spent a couple of hours together copying out <EM>The
Development of Capitalism.</EM> Then there were all kinds of odd
jobs to do. One day Potresov sent us Kautsky's book criticizing
Bernstein, which we were allowed to keep no longer than a
fortnight. We dropped everything else we were doing and translated
it exactly on time. After work we went out for walks. Vladimir
Ilyich was a passionate hunter. He got himself a pair of leather
breeches, and prowled about all the swamps in the neighbourhood!
They teemed with game, I must say. Arriving as I did in the
spring, I had been rather surprised at it all. Prominski would
come in &#8211; he was passionately fond of hunting too &#8211; and say with a
huge smile: "The ducks have come over &#8211; I have seen them." And then
Oscar would come in, talking ducks. They would talk about them for
hours, and the next spring found me, too, capable of talking
about ducks and who had seen them, and where and when. Nature in
the spring burst into riotous life after the winter frosts. Her
sway grew powerful. Sunset. Wild swans swam in the vast puddles
which spring had formed in the fields. Or we would stand on the
fringe of the woods, listening to the babble of a brook and the
mating call of the wood-grouse. Vladimir Ilyich would ask me to
hold Zhenka while he went into the woods. I would stand there
holding the dog, who trembled with excitement, while I felt this
tempestuous awakening of nature tingling in ail my veins. Vladimir
Ilyich was a passionate hunter, but apt to get too excited over
it. in the autumn we went far out into the forest
cuttings. Vladimir Ilyich would say: "You know, if I come across a
hare I won't shoot it, because I didn't bring my bags. It will be
awkward to carry." Yet as soon as a hare came bounding out he
would let go at it.</P>
<p>
Late in the autumn, when sludge was already drifting down the
Yenisei, we went out to the islands after the hares. The hares
were already turning white. They could not escape from the island,
and ran about like goats. Our hunters would sometimes shoot a
boat-load of them.</P>
<p>
When we lived in Moscow, Vladimir Ilyich in his latter years
would still go hunting sometimes, but with nothing like the old
zest. Once a fox battue was organized, and Vladimir Ilyich was
greatly interested in the enterprise. "A clever idea," he said,
when he saw the strung flags. The beaters drove the fox straight
towards him, but he seized his gun when it was too late. The fox
stopped and looked at him, then slipped away into the woods. "Why
didn't you shoot?" I asked him. "The fox was so beautiful," he
said.</P>
<p>
Late in the autumn, when the rivers had frozen overbut no snow
had yet fallen, we went far upstream. Every little fish and
pebble could be seen distinctly under the ice. It was like an
enchanted kingdom. In the winter, when the mercury freezes in the
thermometers and the rivers freeze right through, the water flows
over the ice, and quickly forms a frozen crust. You could skate a
couple of miles on this sagging ice crust. Vladimir Ilyich was
terribly fond of this sport.</P>
<p>
In the evenings Vladimir Ilyich usually read books on
philosophy &#8211; Hegel, Kant or the French materialists &#8211; and when he
grew very tired, Pushkin, Lermontov or Nekrasov.</P>
<p>
When Vladimir Ilyich first turned up in St. Petersburg I had
known him only from hearsay. Stepan Radchenko told me that he only
read serious books and had never read a novel in his life. It had
surprised me at the time. Afterwards, when I got to know him
better, this question had somehow never come up, and it was only
in Siberia that I found out that the story was sheer
invention. Vladimir Ilyich had not only read Turgenev, L. Tolstoi,
Chernyshevsky's <EM>What Is To Be Done?</EM> but reread them many
times and was generally fond of the classics which he knew
intimately. Afterwards, when the Bolsheviks came to power, he set
Gosizdat the task of reprinting the classics in cheap
editions. His photo albums contained pictures of Zola and Herzen
and several photos of Chernyshevsky, as well as photos of his
relatives and old political convicts.</P>
<p>
The mail came twice a week. Our correspondence was
extensive. Anna Ilyinichna &#8211; Lenin's sister &#8211; wrote fully about
everything from St. Petersburg. Nina Struve wrote me, by the way,
that her baby boy was "already holding his head up, and every day
we show him the portraits of Darwin and Marx, and say:'Nod to
Uncle Darwin, nod to Uncle Marx &#8211; and he nods in such an amusing
way." We received letters from distant places of exile &#8211; from
Martov in Turukhansk, from Potresov in Orlov, Vyatka
Gubernia. Most of the letters, however, were from comrades
scattered throughout the neighbouring villages. The 
Krzhizhanovskys and Starkov wrote from Minusinsk (fifty versts from Shushenskoye); thirty versts away, in Yermakovskop, lived Lepeshinsky, Vaneyev, Silvin and Panin &#8211; the latter a friend of Oscar's. Seventy versts away, at Tes, lived Lengnik, Shapoval and Baramzin, while Kurnatovsky lived at a sugar refinery. We corresponded on every possible topic &#8211; the Russian news, future plans, books, new trends and philosophy. We corresponded also on chess problems, especially with Lepeshinsky. Vladimir Ilyich played games by correspondence. He would set out the figures and ponder over the board. He got so enthusiastic about it that he once cried out in his sleep: "If he moves his knight here, I'll put my rook there!"</P>
<p>
Both Vladimir Ilyich and his brother Alexander had been
enthusiastic chess players ever since they were children. Their
father had played chess too. "Father used to beat us at first,"
Vladimir Ilyich once told me, "but then my brother and I got hold
of a chess manual and started beating him. Once I met my father
coming out of our room &#8211; it was upstairs &#8211; with a lighted candle in
one hand and the chess manual in the other. He made a study of it
too."</P> 
<P>Vladimir Ilyich gave up chess when he returned to
Russia. "Chess is too absorbing, it interferes with your work."
and as Vladimir Ilyich was incapable of doing anything by halves,
and always gave himself up wholeheartedly to whatever he was
doing, it was usually with reluctance that he sat down to a game
of chess when relaxing or when he lived abroad as a political
emigrant.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich, from his early youth, had a knack of being
able to cast aside whatever interfered with his work. "When I was
a schoolboy I went in for skating, but it made me tired and
sleepy, and interfered with my studies, so I gave it up," he
said.</P>
<p>
"At one time," he related on another occasion, "I was very
keen on Latin." "Latin?" I said, surprised. "Yes, but it
interfered with my other studies, so I gave it up." Only
recently, while reading an article in <EM>Lef</EM> dealing with
the style and sentence structure of Vladimir Ilyich's writings,
which were said to resemble those of the Roman orators, did I
understand Vladimir Ilyich's interest in the Latin writers.</P>
<p>
We not only corresponded with other comrades in exile, but
sometimes, though not often, met them.</P>
<p>
Once we went to see Kurnatovsky. He was a good comrade and a
highly educated Marxist, but life had dealt harshly with him. An
unhappy childhood dominated by a cruel father, and then exile
after exile, prison after prison. He had hardly ever done any
work &#8211; after a month or two of freedom he would be snatched back
again for long terms. He never had any real life. One little
incident stands out in my memory. We were passing the sugar
refinery at which he was employed. Two girls were going along, the
youngest quite a little one. The elder one was carrying an empty
pail, the younger one a pail with beetroots. "Aren't you ashamed,
a big girl like you making the little one carry things,"
Kurnatovsky said to the bigger girl. She just looked at him with a
puzzled air. We also went to Tes. We had received a letter from
the Krzhizhanovskys, saying: "The ispravnik is wild with us
Tesians over some protest or other, and we are not allowed to go
anywhere. We have a mountain here of geological interest. Write
and say that you want to explore it." Vladimir Ilyich did so just
for fun, and asked the ispravnik for permission to go to Tes both
for himself and his wife, who was to assist him. The ispravnik
sent his permission by messenger. We hired a dog-cart for three
rubles &#8211; the woman assuring us that the horse was a strong beast
and not a big eater at all &#8211; and off we drove. The
"not-a-big-eater," however, proved to be a jibber, but we got to
Tes all the same. Vladimir Ilyich discussed Kant with Lengnik and
the Kazan study-circles with Baramzin. Lengnik, who had a fine
voice, sang to us. That trip, on the whole, is a very pleasant
memory.</P>
<p>
We went to Yermakovskoye once or twice. The first time &#8211; to
adopt a resolution on the "Credo," (Vaneyev, seriously ill with
consumption, was dying, and his bed was carried out into the big
room where we had all assembled). The resolution was adopted
unanimously. The second time we went there was to attend Vaneyev's
funeral.</P>
<p>
Two of the "Decembrists" were soon put out of
action &#8211; Zaporozhets, who went mad in prison, and Vaneyev, who died
from an illness contracted there. Both passed away just when the
flame of the working-class movement had
begun to burn high.</P>
<p>
On New Year's eve we went to Minusinsk, where all the exiled Social-Democrats had gathered.</P>
<p>
There were also exiled Narodovoltsi in Minusinsk &#8211; Kohn,
Tyrkov and others &#8211; but they kept aloof. These old revolutionaries
were sceptical of the Social-Democratic youth. They did not
believe that they were real revolutionaries. In this connection
an incident occurred in the Minusinsk Uyezd shortly before my
arrival in Shushenskoye. There was an exiled Social-Democrat named
Raichin living in Minusinsk. He was connected with the
"Emancipation of Labour" group abroad. He decided to run
away. Money was provided for his escape, but the date for it had
not been fixed yet. Raichin was worked up to such a nervous state
when he got the money, that he ran away without telling
anyone. The old Narodovoltsi accused the Social-Democrats of
having known of Raichin's intended flight and not warned them
about it so that they could have cleaned up in case the police
made a search. Feeling ran high. Vladimir Ilyich told me about it
when I arrived. "There is nothing worse than these exile
scandals," he said. "They get people terribly worked up. These Old
Men have bad enough nerves as it is after what they've been
through, and all the convict prisons they've been in. We mustn't
let ourselves get mixed up in such scandals &#8211; we have all our work
ahead of us, we mustn't waste ourselves on such affairs." Vladimir
Ilyich was for breaking with the Old Men. I remember the meeting
at which that break occurred. The decision to break off with them
had been made earlier, and it was now merely a question of putting
it through as painlessly as possible. We made the break because we
had to, but we did it without malice, in fact with regret. We kept
apart after that.</P>
<p>
On the whole, our exile was not so bad. Those were years of
serious study. The closer the end of our exile drew in sight, the
more did Vladimir Ilyich think about the work facing us. The news
from Russia was scanty. "Economism" was gaining ground there, and
there was no Party to speak of. We had no printing plants in
Russia, and an attempt to arrange printing through the Bund had
failed. On the other hand, we could no longer confine ourselves to
writing popular pamphlets without expressing our views on the
fundamental questions of our work. Party work was completely
disorganized and constant arrests made any continuity
impossible. People had gone to such lengths as the "Credo" and the
ideas of <EM>Rabochaya Mysl</EM>, which had printed a letter from
a worker, boosted by the "Economists," who wrote that "We workers
do not want any of your Marxes or Engelses."</P>
<p>
L. Tolstoi wrote somewhere that during the first part of his
journey a person usually thinks of what he has left behind, and
during the second part &#8211; of what is awaiting him ahead. It was the
same in exile. At the beginning it was chiefly a matter of summing
up the past. Later we thought more about what lay ahead of
us. Vladimir Ilyich gave ever closer thought to the question of
what was to be done to extricate the Party from the plight it was
in, what was to be done to direct the work into the proper
channels and ensure for it a correct Social-Democratic
leadership. Where were we to begin? During the last year of his
exile, Vladimir Ilyich had conceived the organizational plan which
he afterwards developed in <EM>Iskra,</EM> in the pamphlet
<EM>What Is to Be Done?</EM> and in his <EM>Letter to a
Comrade.</EM> The thing was to start with the organization of an
all-Russian newspaper. It was to be established abroad and linked
up as closely as possible with the activities and organizations in
Russia, and the best possible shipping arrangements had to be
made. Vladimir Ilyich hardly slept at all, and grew terribly
thin. He sat up all night, working out his plan in fullest
detail. He discussed it with Krzhizhanovsky and with me, he
corresponded with Martov and Potresov about it, and made
arrangements with them for going abroad. He grew more and more
impatient as time went on, eager to throw himself into the
work. Just then, as luck would have it, the police came down on us
with a search warrant. They had found somewhere a postal receipt
for a letter which Lyakhovsky had written to Vladimir Ilyich. The
letter was about a tombstone for Fedoseyev, and this was a good
enough excuse for the gendarmes to make a search. This was done in
May 1899. They found the letter &#8211; quite an innocent one &#8211; and went
through our correspondence without finding anything of
interest. By old habit acquired in St. Petersburg, we kept our
illegal correspondence apart from the rest. It was not much of a
hiding place, though &#8211; the bottom shelf of the bookcase. Vladimir
Ilyich pushed up a bench for the gendarmes to stand on, and they
began their search from the top shelves, which were lined with
various statistical publications. They got so tired that they did
not even look at the bottom shelf, and were satisfied with my
statement that it only contained my books on pedagogics. The
search passed off safely, but we were afraid they might make this
a pretext for adding a few more years to our term of exile. An
escape in those days was not the common occurrence it became
later. In any case it would have complicated matters,
because, before going abroad, a good deal of organizing work had
to be done in Russia. Everything went well, however, and our term
was not increased.</P>
<p>
In February 1900, at the end of Vladimir Ilyich's term of
exile, we set out for Russia. Pasha, who had grown into a
beautiful girl in two years, wept rivers of tears at night. Minka
busied himself, collecting and lugging home the paper, pencils,
pictures and other odds and ends that we were leaving
behind. Oscar came in and sat down on the edge of a chair,
evidently deeply agitated. He brought ms a present &#8211; a hand-made
brooch in the form of a book with the inscription "Karl Marx" on
it, in memory of the lessons on <EM>Capital</EM> which he had
taken with me. The landlady and her neighbours kept looking
in. Our dog could not make out what all the fuss was about, and
kept opening all the doors with his nose to make sure that
everything was in its proper place. Mother busied herself with the
packing, coughing from the dust, and Vladimir Ilyich tied the
books up with a business-like air.</P>
<p>
We arrived in Minusinsk, where we were to pick up Starkov and
Olga Silvina. The whole exile fraternity were gathered there, and
the mood was the usual one that prevailed whenever one of their
number returned to Russia. Each was thinking when and where he
would go himself when his time came, how he could work. Vladimir
Ilyich had already made joint-work arrangements with all those who
were expecting shortly to return to Russia, and now arranged for
carrying on a correspondence with those who remained. Everyone was
thinking about Russia while talking trivialities.</P>
<p>
Baramzin was feeding sandwiches to Zhenka, who was being left
him as an inheritance, but the dog took no notice of him. He lay
at Mother's feet and did not take his eyes off her, watching her
every movement.</P>
<p>
At last, fitted out in high felt boots, heel-length fur coats,
etc., we started out. We travelled 300 versts down the Yenisei by
sledge day and night, taking advantage of a full moon. Vladimir
Ilyich wrapped us up carefully at every stage-house, looked round
to see that we had not forgotten anything, and joked with Olga
Silvina, who was feeling the cold. We raced along at top
speed, and Vladimir Ilyich &#8211; he rode without a top fur coat,
assuring us that he felt too hot in it &#8211; sat with his hands thrust
into a muff borrowed from Mother, his thoughts flying ahead of him
to Russia, where he would be able to work to his heart's
content.</P>
<p>
At Ufa we received a visit from the local comrades on the day
of our arrival &#8211; A. D. Tsyurupa, Svidersky and Krokhmal. "We've
been to six hotels," Krokhmal said, stuttering. "At last we've
found you."</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich spent two days in Ufa, and after having talked
with the locals, he entrusted me and Mother to the care of our
comrades and moved on nearer to St. Petersburg. All I remember of
those two days was our visit to Chetvergova, an old Narodovolets,
whom Vladimir Ilyich had known in Kazan. She had a bookshop in
Ufa. Vladimir Ilyich went to see her the very first day, and there
was a peculiar gentleness in his voice and face when he spoke to
her. When, later, I read what Vladimir Ilyich had written at the
end of his <EM>What Is To Be Done?</EM> I recalled that
visit. "Many of them" (meaning the young Social-Democrat leaders
of the workers' movement), Vladimir Ilyich wrote in <EM>What Is To
Be Done?</EM> "began their revolutionary thinking as adherents of
Narodnaya Volya. Nearly all of them in their early youth
enthusiastically worshipped the terrorist heroes. It required a
struggle to abandon the captivating impressions of these heroic
traditions, and it was accompanied by the break of personal
relations with people who were determined to remain loyal to the
Narodnaya Volya and for whom the young Social-Democrats had
profound respect." This passage is a piece of Vladimir Ilyich's
own biography.</P>
<p>
It was a pity we had to part just when the "real" work was
starting, but it did not even enter our heads that Vladimir Ilyich
could remain in Ufa when he had a chance to move nearer to
St. Petersburg.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich went to live in Pskov, where Potresov and
L. N. Radchenko with his children afterwards resided. Vladimir
Ilyich once laughingly related how Radchenko's little girls,
Zhenyurka and Lyuda, used to mimic him and Potresov. They would
walk up and down the room together with their hands behind their
backs, one saying "Bernstein" and the other answering "Kautsky."</p>
<P>There, in Pskov, Vladimir Ilyich assiduously wove the threads
of the organization that were to closely tie up the future
all-Russian newspaper abroad with activities at home. He had
meetings with Babushkin and many other comrades.</P>
<p>
Gradually I acclimatized myself to Ufa and got translation work and some lessons.</P>
<p>
There had been one of those exile scandals in Ufa shortly
before my arrival, as a result of which the Social-Democrats had
split up into two camps. In one camp were Krokhmal, Tsyurupa and
Svidersky, in the other &#8211; the Plaksin brothers, Saltykov and
Kvyatkovsky. Chachina and Aptekinan were neutral and maintained
relations with both groups. The first group stood nearer to me,
and I soon became associated with it. This group did some work of
a kind, and was the more active of the local fraternity.
They had connections with the railway workshops, where there was a circle of twelve Social-Democratic workers. The most active worker was Yakutov. He often came to see me to get books and have a talk. He spoke a lot about "popularizing" Marx, but when he did manage to get the book he could not read it. "I haven't the time," he complained to me. "You know how it is, with the peasants coming to me with their troubles. You've got to talk with them all, so's they won't think bad of themselves &#8211; and it leaves you no time." He said that his wife Natasha was a sympathizer, and that exile did not scare them. He'd get on anywhere, his hands would always feed him. He was well up in secrecy technique, and there was nothing he hated more than heroics, boasting, and claptrap. Everything had to be done quietly and efficiently.</p>
<p>
Yakutov was president of the republic that was set up in Ufa
in 1905. Later, during the years of reaction, he was hanged in Ufa
prison. He died in the prison yard, while the whole prison
sang &#8211; they sang in every cell &#8211; and swore never to forget his
death and never to forgive it.</P>
<p>
I also helped other workers in their studies. One was a young
metal-worker employed at a small factory, who told me about the
life of the local workers. He was a very high-strung, nervous
man. I learned afterwards that he went over to the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and became insane in prison.</P>
<p>
One of my visitors was a consumptive bookbinder named Krylov,
who painstakingly made double bindings to hide illegal manuscripts
in, and made paste~board out of manuscripts to be used in
binding. He told me about the work of the local printers.</P>
<p>
Subsequent correspondence sent to <EM>Iskra</EM> was based on these stories.</P>
<p>
We carried on our work at the neighbouring factories as well
as in Ufa itself. The doctor's assistant at the Ust-Katavsk works
was a Social-Democrat. She conducted propaganda there among the
workers and distributed illegal popular literature, which we
needed ever so badly.</P>
<p>
There were several Social-Democratic students at the various
factories. Our Ufa organization had an illegal agent in
Ekaterinburg &#8211; a worker named Mazanov, who had returned from
Turukhansk, where he had been in exile together with Martov. The
work made no headway with him, though.</P>
<p>
Ufa was the gubernia centre, and the exiles of Sterlitamak,
Birsk and other uyezd towns were always trying to obtain
permission to go there. Besides, Ufa lay on the road between
Siberia and Russia. Comrades returning from exile stopped over to
make arrangements about work. Among these were Martov (he had not
been able to get away from Turukhansk for some time),
G. I. Okulova, and Panin. Lydia Knipovich (Uncle) came illegally
from Astrakhan, and Rumyantsev and Portugalov came from
Samara.</P>
<p>
Martov went to live in Poltava. We were in touch with him and
hoped to receive literature through him. The literature arrived, I
think, a week after my departure, and Kvyatkovsky, who went to
fetch it, got five years in Siberia for his pains &#8211; the box
containing the literature had broken open on the way. As a matter
of fact, he was not an active member of the organization, and had
only undertaken to go for the parcel because it was addressed to
the brewery, the daughter of whose proprietor he had been giving
lessons to.</P>
<P>There were Narodovoltsi in Ufa too &#8211; Leonovich, and afterwards Borozdich.</P>
<p>
Just before leaving the country, Vladimir Ilyich had a narrow
escape. He arrived in St. Petersburg from Pskov together with
Martov. They were shadowed and arrested. He had two thousand
rubles in his waistcoat, which he had received from Auntie
(A. M. Kalmykova), and a list of contacts written in invisible ink
on the back of an ordinary invoice. Had it occurred to the
gendarmes to hold that invoice before a fire, Vladimir Ilyich
would never have established an all-Russian newspaper abroad. But
he was in luck, and after ten days or so he was released.</P>
<p>
After that he came to Ufa to say good-bye to me. He told me
what he had succeeded in doing since we had last met and the
people he had managed to see. Naturally, a number of meetings were
held on the occasion of his arrival. I remember that when it
transpired that Leonovich, who considered himself a Narodovolets,
had not even heard about the "Emancipation of Labour" group,
Vladimir Ilyich flared up: "Fancy a revolutionary not knowing
that? How can he intelligently choose a party he is going to work
with when he does not know, has not studied, what the
'Emancipation of Labour' group has written?"</P>
<P>Vladimir Ilyich stayed about a week, I believe, in Ufa.</P>
<p>
He wrote to me from abroad, chiefly by ciphered messages in
books, which he addressed to various Zemstvo men. Things were not
moving as fast with the newspaper as Vladimir Ilyich desired. He
had trouble in coming to an understanding with Plekhanov. His
letters were short and cheerless, and ended with: "I shall tell
you all about it when you come over." "I have written down for you
a full account of the conflict with Plekhanov." </P>
<P>I could hardly wait for the end of my exile. On top of it all I
had not received any letters from Vladimir Ilyich for a long
time.</P>
<p>
I had intended going to Astrakhan to see Uncle (Lydia Knipovich), but was in too great a hurry.</P>
<p>
Mother and I went to see Maria Alexandrovna &#8211; Vladimir Ilyich's
mother &#8211; in Moscow. She was alone there at the time, her daughters
Maria being in prison, and Anna abroad.</P>
<p>
I was very fond of Maria Alexandrovna. She was always so
tactful and considerate. Vladimir Ilyich loved his mother very
much. "She has tremendous will-power," he told me once. "If this
had happened to my brother when Father was alive, I don't know
what there would have been."</P>
<P>
Vladimir Ilyich inherited his mother's strength of mind as well
as her tact and kindness towards people.</P>
<p>
When we lived abroad I tried to describe our life to her in my
letters in as lively a way as I could to make her feel a bit
nearer to her son. When Vladimir Ilyich was in Siberian exile in
1897 (I had not joined him yet) the papers published an obituary
notice on a Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, who had died in
Moscow. Engberg told me: "I came to see Vladimir Ilyich, and he
was as white as a sheet.'My mother is dead, he says." But the
obituary notice turned out to be that on another woman of the same
name.</P>
<p>
Maria Alexandrovna had suffered much, what with the execution
of her eldest son, the death of her daughter Olga, and the
repeated arrests of her other children.</P>
<p>
When Vladimir Ilyich fell ill in 1895, she came immediately to
nurse him, and cooked his food herself. His arrest found her at
her old post again: sitting for hours in the gloomy waiting-room
of the House of Preliminary Detention, coming to see him on
visiting day and bringing him parcels. But for a slightly shaky
head, she had not changed a bit.</P>
<p>
I promised her to look after Vladimir Ilyich, but I could not keep my promise....</P>
<p>
From Moscow I took my mother to St. Petersburg, where I fixed
her up and went abroad. I had some amusing adventures on that
trip. I went to Prague in the belief that Vladimir Ilyich was
living there under the name of Modracek.</P>
<p>
I sent him a telegram. At Prague no one met me. I waited as
long as I could, then, greatly embarrassed, hailed a top-hatted
cabby, piled my baskets into his cab and rode off. We arrived in a
working-class quarter, and stopped outside a great tenement house
in a narrow turning. A multitude of featherbeds were being aired
in the open windows of the building.</P>
<p>
I flew up to the fourth floor. A fair-headed little Czech
woman answered the door. All I could say was: "Modracek, Herr
Modracek." A workman came out. "I am Modracek," he
says. Bewildered, I stammered, "No, it's my husband." At last
Modracek saw daylight. "Ah, you must be the wife of Herr
Rittmeyer. He lives in Munich, but sent books and letters to you
in Ufa through me." Modracek spent the whole day with me. I told
him about the Russian movement, and he told me about the Austrian
movement. His wife showed me her needlework and treated me to a
meal of Czech dumplings.</P>
<p>
I arrived in Munich in a fur coat when people there were going
about in dresses. Made wise by experience, I left my luggage in
the cloak-room and went in search of Rittmeyer by tram. I found
the house. Flat No. 1 turned out to be a beer-house. I approached
the fat little German behind the bar and timidly asked for Herr
Rittmeyer with a feeling that something was wrong again. "That's
me," said the publican. Absolutely crushed, I mumbled: "No, it's
my husband."</P>
<p>
And there we stood, staring at each other like a couple of
idiots. At last Rittmeyer's wife came in, and glancing at me,
said: "Ah, it must he Herr Meyer's wife. He is expecting his wife
from Siberia. I'll take you to him." </P>
<P>I followed Frau Rittmeyer through the backyard of the big
building to an untenanted-looking flat. The door opened, and there
at a table sat Vladimir Ilyich, Martov and Anna
Ilyinichna. Forgetting to thank my guide, I began to give Vladimir
Ilyich a piece of my mind. "Damn it all, couldn't you write and
tell me where you were?"</P>
<p>
"But I did! I've been going to the station to meet you three times a day. How did you get here?"</P>
<p>
As we afterwards learned, the Zemstvo man to whom the book
with the address had been sent had kept the book to read.</P>
<P>Many a Russian travelled afterwards in the same
manner. Shlyapnikov first went to Genoa instead of
Geneva. Babushkin very nearly landed in America instead of London.</p>
