Back in St. Petersburg</h1>
<hr class="end">
<BR>
<P>
A man was to meet Vladimir Ilyich in Stockholm and provide him
with documents under another name so that he could enter the
country and take up residence in St. Petersburg. Days passed and
the man did not turn up. Vladimir Ilyich had to sit doing
nothing while revolutionary events in Russia were assuming a
more and more sweeping character. After a fortnight's wait in
Stockholm, he arrived in Russia at the beginning of
November. Ten days later I followed him out, after having
settled all affairs in Geneva. A detective got on the boat with
me at Stockholm and never let me out of his sight in the train
all the way from Hango to Helsingfors. In Finland the
revolution was already in full swing. I wanted to send a wire to
St. Petersburg, but the smiling cheerful Finnish girl told me
she could not accept any telegrams because there was a strike of
the post and telegraph workers. Conversation in the railway
coaches was loud and excited. I got into conversation with a
Finnish Activist, who, for some reason, was speaking in
German. He was describing the successes of the revolution. "We
have arrested all the sleuths and put them in prison," he
said. My glance fell on the one who was travelling with
me. "Yes, but others may come in their place," I said with a
laugh, looking meaningly at my detective. The Finn grasped the
situation. "Oh, you just say the word if you notice anybody," he
cried. "We'll have him arrested at once." At the next wayside
station my spy got up and went out, although the train only
stopped there for a minute. And that was the last I saw of
him.</P>
<p>
I had been living abroad for close on four years and was just
dying to be back in St. Petersburg. The city was seething, I knew,
but the quietness of the Finland Station, where I got off the
train, was so completely at variance with what I had imagined
St. Petersburg and the revolution to be like, that I suddenly
thought I had made a mistake and got off at Pargolovo instead of
St. Petersburg. Puzzled, I asked a cabby standing there, "What
stop is this?" The man was so surprised that he actually stepped
back. Then, with arms akimbo he looked me over ironically, and
said: "This isn't a stop, it's the city of Saint Petersburg."</P>
<p>
Outside the station I was met by Pyotr Rumyantsev. He told me
that Vladimir Ilyich was staying with them in the neighbourhood of
Peski, and we drove down there together. I had first met
Rumyantsev at Shelgunov's funeral. He had then been a youngster
with a curly mop, and had walked in front of the demonstration,
singing. I met him again in Poltava in 1896 where he was at the
centre of the Social-Democrats. He had just come out of prison,
and was pale and nervous. An intelligent man, he had enjoyed great
influence and seemed a good comrade.</P>
<p>
In 1900 I saw him in Ufa, where he had arrived from Samara,
and he had had a sort of disillusioned languid look about him.</P>
<p>
He appeared on the scene again in 1905, this time as a
literary man with a social position and a paunch, something of the
bon vivant, but a clever and effective speaker.He had conducted
the campaign for boycotting the Shidlovsky Commission splendidly,
and had acquitted himself like a staunch Bolshevik. Shortly after
the Third Congress he was co-opted to the Central Committee.</P>
<p>
He had a pleasant well-furnished flat, and Vladimir Ilyich
stayed there for the time being without registering.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich always felt very uncomfortable living in
strange homes. He could not work so well either. When I arrived he
became urgent about taking lodgings together, and we moved into
furnished apartments in Nevsky Prospekt without registering. I
remember getting into conversation there with the servant girls,
who told me lots of things about what was happening in
St. Petersburg with a mass of intimate and revealing details. Of
course, I retold it all to Vladimir Ilyich at once. He
complimented me on my ability to find things out, and from then on
I became his sedulous reporter. Usually, when we lived in Russia,
I could move about much more freely than he could, and speak with
a much larger number of people. Two or three questions by Ilyich
were enough to tell me exactly what he wanted to know, and I would
keep my eyes open. I have still retained that habit of mentally
formulating my every impression for Ilyich.</P>
<p>
The very next day I managed to make a fairly rich haul in
this respect. I went room hunting, and while looking over an empty
flat in Troitskaya Street, I fell into conversation with the
janitor. He told me quite a lot about the countryside and the
landowner, and about how the land had to be taken away from the
gentry and given to the peasants.</P>
<p>
Meanwhile we had decided to take up legal residence. Maria
Ilyinichna fixed us up with some friends in Grechesky
Prospekt. The moment we registered our house was surrounded by a
swarm of police spies. Our host was so scared that he did not
sleep all night and walked about with a revolver in his pocket,
determined to meet the police arms in hand. "Drat the man, he'll
only get us into trouble," said Ilyich. We took separate rooms and
lived illegally. I was given a passport in the name of Praskovia
Onegina and lived with that document all the time. Vladimir Ilyich
changed his passport several times.</P>
<p>
When Vladimir Ilyich arrived in Russia the legal daily
newspaper <EM>Novaya Zhizn (New Life)</EM> was already
appearing. Its publisher was Maria Andreyevz (Corky's wife),
the editor was the poet Minsky, and contributors were Corky,
Leonid Andreyev, Chirikov, Balmont, Teffi and others. The
Bolshevik collaborators on the paper were Bogdanov, Rumyantsev,
Rozhkov, Goldenberg, Orlovsky, Lunacharsky, Bazarov, Kamenev and
others. The secretary of <EM>Novaya Zhizn </EM>and of all
subsequent Bolshevik newspapers at that period was Dmitry
Leshchenko, who also acted as news editor, Duma reporter, copyman,
etc.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich's first article appeared on November 10. It
began with the words: "The conditions of activity of our Party are
undergoing a radical change. Freedom of assembly, of association
and of the press has been seized." And Ilyich hastened to make the
most of these changed conditions by promptly dashing off with a
bold stroke the main outlines of the "new course." The secret
machinery of the Party was to be preserved. At the same time it
was absolutely essential to set up more and more legal and
semi-legal Party and affiliated organizations. More and more
cadres of workers had to be enlisted in the Party. The working
class was spontaneously and instinctively Social-Democratic, but
ten odd years of Social-Democratic work had done quite a lot to
turn this spontaneity into consciousness. "At the Third Congress
of the Party," Vladimir Ilyich wrote in a footnote to this
article, "I expressed the wish that the Party committees be formed
in the proportion of about eight workers to two intellectuals. How
obsolete this wish appears at the present time!</P>
<p>
"Now we must wish for the new Party organizations to have one
Social-Democratic intellectual to several hundred
Social-Democratic workers." </P>
<p>
Addressing himself to the "committeemen" who feared that the
Party would be swamped by the mass, Vladimir Ilyich wrote: "Do not
invent bogies, comrades!" The Social-Democratic intellectuals now
had to "go to the people." "The initiative of the workers
themselves will now display itself on a scale that we, the
under. grounders and circle-ists of yesterday, did not even dare
dream of." </P>
<p>
"Our task now is not so much to invent norms for the
organizations on a new basis as to develop the most farreaching
and boldest work." </P>
<p>
"In order to put the organization on a new basis, another Party congress must be called." </P>
<p>
Such was the gist of Ilyich's first "legal" article. The
methods of the study-circle stage, which were still in evidence
everywhere, had to be combatted.</P>
<p>
Naturally, one of the first things I did on my arrival was to
go to the Nevskaya Zastava to visit the old Smolenskaya Sunday
Evening School. No "geography" and natural history were being
taught there now. Propagandist work was being conducted in the
classrooms, which were packed with working men and women. The
Party propagandists were reading lectures. I remember one of them,
a young propagandist, who was dealing with a theme of Engels'
<EM>Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</EM>. The workers sat
without stirring, trying their hardest to grasp what the lecturer
was telling them. No one asked any questions. Downstairs, our
Party girls were arranging a club for the workers, setting out
glasses which they had brought from town.</P>
<p>
When I told Ilyich my impressions of what I had seen he
became thoughtfully silent. It was not this he wanted to see, but
the activity of the workers themselves. Not that such activity did
not exist. It did, but it was not in evidence at Party
meetings. The channels through which Party work and the workers'
activity flowed somehow did not seem to meet. The workers had
grown tremendously in stature during those years. I felt it more
than ever when I met my former Sunday School "pupils." Once I was
hailed in the street by a baker. He turned out to be a former
pupil of mine &#8211; "Socialist Bakin," who had been deported to his
home village ten years before as a result of a naive argument with
the manager of the Maxwell Mills, to whom he had tried to prove
that in changing over from two mule-jennies to three he would be
increasing the "intensity of labour." He was now a fully conscious
Social-Democrat, and we had a long talk about the growing
revolution and the organization of the working-class masses. He
told me all about the bakers strike.</P>
<p>
That first article of Ilyich's, in which he wrote openly
about the Party congress and the Party's secret organization,
turned <EM>Novaya Zhizn</EM> into a legal Party organ. It goes
without saying that the presence on the paper of such men as
Minsky, Balmont and their like was no longer conceivable. A
dissociation took place and the newspaper passed completely into
the hands of the Bolsheviks. It became a Party paper
organizationally, too, and began to work under the control and
guidance of the Party.</P>
<p>
Ilyich's next article in<EM> Novaya Zhizn</EM> dealt with a
fundamental issue of the Russian revolution &#8211; the relations between
the proletariat and the peasantry. The Mensheviks were not the
only ones to misinterpret these relations; even among the
Bolsheviks certain comrades still had an "otrezki deviation."
Instead of being a starting-point for agitation, this question of
otrezki became for them an end in itself. They continued to uphold
it even when the facts of reality had made it possible and
necessary to conduct agitation and struggle on quite a different
basis.</P>
<p>
Ilyich's article "The Proletariat and the Peasantry" was a
guiding article which supplied a clear Party slogan: The
proletariat of Russia together with the peasantry is fighting for
the land and freedom, together with the international proletariat
and the agricultural workers it is fighting for socialism.</P>
<p>
The Bolshevik representatives also began to defend this
standpoint in the Soviet of Workers' Deputies. This Soviet came
into being as a militant organ of the fighting proletariat on
October 13, when Vladimir Ilyich was still abroad. I do not
remember Ilyich's speech at the Soviet of Workers' Deputies. I
remember a meeting at the Free Economic Society, where a large
number of Party people had gathered to hear Vladimir Ilyich
speak. Ilyich read a lecture on the agrarian question. It was
there that he first met Alexinsky. Almost everything connected
with that meeting has faded from my memory. I have a dim
recollection of a grey door and Vladimir Ilyich making for the
exit through the crowd. Other comrades will probably recollect it
more clearly. All I remember is that the meeting was held in
November and that Vladimir Nevsky was there.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich was quick to note the fact in his November
articles that the Soviets of Workers' Deputies were militant
organizations of the people in revolt. He expounded the idea that
a provisional revolutionary government could only be forged in the
crucible of revolutionary struggle on the one hand, and that the
Social-Democratic Party, on the other, should strive its hardest
to win influence in the Soviets of Workers' Deputies.</P>
<p>
For reasons of secrecy Vladimir Ilyich and I lived apart. All
day long he worked on the editorial board, which met not only at
the <EM>Novaya Zhizn </EM>offices, but in a secret apartment or at
the flat of Dmitry Leshchenko in Glazovskaya Street. It was not
very convenient for me to go there for reasons of secrecy. More
often than not we met at the <EM>Novaya Zhizn</EM>
offices. Vladimir Ilyich was always busy there, however. It was
not until he received a very good passport and moved to a place on
the corner of Basseinaya and Nadezhdinskaya that I was able to
visit him at home. I had to go in through the back entrance and
speak in an undertone, but nevertheless we could have a good long
talk about everything.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich took a trip to Moscow from this flat. I went
to see him as soon as he returned. I was struck by the number of
spies lurking round every corner. "Why have they started
shadowing you like this?" I asked Vladimir Ilyich. He had not been
out of the house since his arrival and was unaware of it. I began
to unpack his suitcase and suddenly came upon a pair of large blue
spectecles. "What's this?" I asked. It appeared that the comrades
in Moscow had rigged him out in those spectacles as a disguise,
supplied him with a yellow Finnish box and put him on a non-stop
train at the last minute. The sleuths were after him at once,
evidently taking him for an expropriator. We had to get out as
quickly as possible. We left the house arm-in-arm as if nothing
had happened and walked in the opposite direction to the one we
needed. We changed cabs three times, slipped through courtyards
that had double entrances and arrived at Rumyantsev's after having
shaken off our shadowers. We spent the night, I believe, with the
Witmers, old friends of mine. We went there in a cab and drove
past the house where Vladimir Ilyich had been living. The sleuths
were still hanging about. Vladimir Ilyich did not return to those
rooms. A fortnight
or so later we sent a girl to fetch his things away and settle up with the landlady.</P>
<p>
At that time I was a secretary of the Central Committee, and
I got into full harness straightaway. The other secretary was
Mikhail Sergeyevich (M. Y. Weinstein). My assistant was Vera
Menzhinskaya. This constituted our secretariat. Mikhail
Sergeyevich was engaged most of the time on the fighting
organization, and was always busy carrying out the instructions of
Nikitich (L. B. Krasin). I was in charge of the secret meeting
places, contact with the local committees and individuals. It is
difficult today to imagine what makeshift methods of work the
secretariat of the C.C. employed in those days. We never attended
the meetings of the C.C., no one was "in charge" of us, no minutes
were taken, and ciphered addresses were kept in matchboxes, book
covers and similar places. We had to rely on our memories. Crowds
of people besieged us, and we gave them every possible attention,
supplied them with whatever they needed &#8211; literature, passports,
instructions and advice. It is inconceivable now how we ever
managed to cope with such a rush of work, and how we had the
complete and uncontrolled run of the whole business. Usually, on
meeting Ilyich, I gave him a lull account of everything. The most
interesting comrades on the most interesting business we referred
direct to the C.C. members.</P>
<p>
The pitched battle with the government was drawing
near. Ilyich wrote openly in <EM>Novaya Zhizn</EM> that the army
could not and should not be neutral; he wrote about the
nation-wide arming of the people. On November 26 Khrustalev-Nosar
was arrested. His place was taken by Trotsky. On December 2 the
Soviet of Workers Deputies issued a manifesto urging nonpayment
of government dues On December 3 eight newspapers including
<EM>Novaya Zhizn</EM> for having printed this manifesto. When I
went to the editorial office that day to keep a "secret
appointment," loaded up with all kinds of illegal literature, I
was intercepted outside by a newsman. <EM>"Novoye Vremya!</EM>" he
shouted, muttering to me in an "aside" to be careful &#8211; "the police
are on the premises." Vladimir Ilyich remarked in this connection,
"The people are with us.</P>
<p>
The Tammerfors Conference was held in the middle of
December. What a pity the minutes of this conference have been
lost! The enthusiasm that reigned there! The revolution was in
full swing, and the enthusiasm was tremendous. Every comrade was
ready for the fight. In the intervals we learned to shoot. One
evening we attended a Finnish mass torchlight meeting, and the
solemnity of it fully harmonized with the temper of the
delegates. I doubt whether anyone who was at that conference could
ever forget
it. Lozovsky, Baransky, Yaroslavsky and many others
were there. I remember these comrades because of the keen interest which their "local reports" aroused.</P>
<p>
The Tammerfors Conference, which was attended only by
Bolsheviks, passed a resolution calling for the immediate
preparation and organization of an armed uprising.</P>
<p>
The uprising in Moscow was developing apace, and so the
conference had to be cut short. If I am not mistaken, we returned
on the very eve the Semyonovsky Regiment was despatched to
Moscow. One incident, at any rate, is fresh in my memory. Not far
from the Trinity Church a soldier of the Semyonovsky Regiment was
walking along with a sullen look. By his side walked a young
worker, who, with his cap in his hand, was arguing warmly with the
soldier and pleading with him. Their faces were so expressive that
one could guess unerringly what the worker was pleading
about &#8211; that the soldiers should not come out against the
workers. It was equally clear that the Semyonovsky soldier did not
agree.</P>
<p>
The Central Committee called upon the proletariat of
St. Petersburg to support the uprising of the Moscow workers,
but no concerted action was achieved. A comparatively raw district
like the Moskovsky responded to the appeal, but an advanced
district like the Nevsky did not. I remember how furious Stanislaw
Wolski was &#8211; he had been agitating in that very district. He lost
heart at once, and all but doubted whether the proletariat was as
revolutionary as he had thought it to be. He failed to take into
account that the St. Petersburg workers were worn out by previous
strikes, and most important of all, they realized how badly
organized and poorly armed they were for a decisive struggle with
tsarism. And that it would be a struggle to the death, they had
the example of Moscow to tell them.</P>
