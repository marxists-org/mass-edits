Second Emigration</h1>
<hr class="end">
<BR>
<p>
The second emigration may be divided into three periods.</P>
<p>
<EM>The first period </EM>(1908-1911) covers the years of
rampant reaction in Russia. The tsarist took savage reprisals
against the revolutionaries. The prisons were full to overflowing,
the prisoners were subject to brutal treatment, and death
sentences followed one after another. The illegal organizations
were driven deep underground, and even so they found it hard to
escape detection. During the revolution the composition of the
Party membership had undergone a change; new members joined the
Party, who had no experience of the pre-revolutionary underground
or of secrecy methods of work. On the other hand, the tsarist
government did not stint any money for the organization of spying
and stool-pigeoning, The system of spying was extremely well
planned and ramified, and its network covered the central organs
of the Party. The government's intelligence service was splendidly
organized.</P>
<p>
Simultaneously, a regular campaign of persecution was
conducted against all legal societies, trade unions and the
press. The government was all out to deprive the masses of the
rights which they had won during the revolution. But there could
be no return to the past; the revOlution had left its mark on the
masses. and the initiative of the workers found went again and
again through every possible crevice.</P>
<p>
Those were years of the greatest confusion of ideas among the
Social-Democrats. Attempts were made to re vise the very
foundations of Marxism, and philosophic , trends arose which tried
to shake the materialistic concepts on which the whole of Marxism
is based. Those were dark days. Attempts were made to find a way
out by inventing a new refined religion and giving it a
philosophical basis. This new school of philosophy, which opened
its doors to all kinds of "God-seekers" and "God-builders," was
headed by Bogdanov and supported by Lunacharsky, Bazarov and
others. Marx arrived at Marxism by way of philosophy, by way of
the struggle against idealism. Plekhanov in his time had devoted
considerable attention to building up evidence in support of the
materialist philosophy. Lenin had made a very intensive study of
their works and devoted a good deal of time to philosophy while
in exile. He was fully alive to the implications of this attempt
at revising the philosophic tenets of Marxism and its significance
during the years of reaction, and opposed Bogdanov and his school
very strongly.</P>
<p>
Bogdanov was not only an opponent on the philosophic
front. He rallied around him the Otzovists and Ultimatumists as
well. The Otzovists said that the State Duma had become so
reactionary that the Social-Democratic members of it should be
recalled. The Ultimatumists held that an ultimatum should be
presented to the Duma, and the Social-Democratic deputies should
make speeches there which would have them thrown out. Strictly
speaking, there was no difference between the Otzovists and the
Ultimatumists. Among the Ultimatumists were Alexinsky and
Marat. The Otzovists and Ultimatumists were opposed also to the
Bolsheviks participating in the trade unions and the legal
societies. A Bolshevik, they declared, should be hard and
unyielding. Lenin considered this view fallacious. It would mean
giving up all practical work, standing aside from the masses
instead of organizing them on real-life issues. Prior to the
Revolution of 1905 the Bolsheviks showed themselves capable of
making good use of every legal possibility, of forging ahead and
rallying the masses behind them under the most adverse
conditions. Step by step, beginning with the campaign for tea
service and ventilation, they had led the masses up to the
national armed insurrection. The ability to adjust oneself to the
most adverse conditions and at the same time to stand out and
maintain one's high-principled positions &#8211; such were the traditions
of Leninism. The Otzovists cut loose from these Bolshevik
traditions. The fight against Otzovism was the fight for the tried
and tested Bolshevik, Leninist tactics.</P>
<p>
Finally, those years (1908-1911) were years of intense
struggle for the Party, for its illegal organization.</P>
<p>
Naturally, the first to show signs of pessimistic moods during
the period of reaction were the Menshevik practical workers, who
had always tended to swim with the stream and narrow down
revolutionary slogans, and were closely linked with the liberal
bourgeoisie. These pessimistic moods were strikingly manifested in
a striving on the part of broad sections of the Mensheviks to
dissolve the Party. These liquidators, as they were called,
maintained that an illegal party only led to police raids and
arrests, and narrowed the scope of the labour movement. As a
matter of fact, liquidation of the illegal Party would have meant
abandoning the independent policy of the proletariat, lowering the
revolutionary spirit of the Proletarian struggle, weakening the
organization and unity of action of the proletariat. The
liquidation of the Party meant rejecting the teaching of Marx and
all its tenets.</P>
<p>
Of course, Mensheviks like Plekhanov, who had done so much for
the propagation of Marxism and the struggle against opportunism,
could not but realize the reactionary character of these
liquidationist moods; and when the preaching for the Party's
liquidation developed into an agitation for the liquidation of the
basic principles of Marxism itself, he dissociated himself from
them completely and formed a group of his own, a group of
Party-Mensheviks.</P>
<p>
The ensuing struggle for the Party tended to shed light on a
number of organizational issues and to give the rank and file of
the Party a better and clearer understanding of the role of the
Party and the duties of its members.</P>
<p>
The struggle for a materialist philosophy, for contact with
the masses, for Leninist tactics, the struggle for the Party, was
waged under conditions of political emigration.</P>
<p>
During the years of reaction the number of political
emigrants from Russia increased tremendously. People fled abroad
to escape the savage persecutions of the tsarist regime, people
with frayed and shattered nerves, without prospects for the
future, without a penny to their name, and without any help from
Russia. All this tended to give to the political struggle an
extremely painful twist. We had more than enough of squabbling and
bickering.</P>
<p>
Looking back over all those years, it is now transparently
clear what the struggle was all about. Now that experience has so
clearly demonstrated the correctness or Lenin's line, that
struggle seems to be of little interest to many people. Without
that struggle, though, the Party would not have been able to
develop its activities as quickly as it did during the rising
tide, and its progress towards victory would have been
handicapped. The struggle took place at a time when the
above-mentioned trends were just taking shape, and was waged
between people who had only recently been fighting side by side,
and many thought that the trouble was due to Lenin's quarrelsome
disposition, his brusqueness and bad temper. Actually, it
was a struggle for the Party's very existence, for its consistent
line and correct tactics. Another reason for the sharp tone which
the controversy assumed was the complicated nature of the issues,
and Ilyich frequently presented them as sharply as he did because
otherwise the essence of the question would have remained
obscure.</P>
<p>
The years 1908 to 1911 were not merely years of living
abroad &#8211; they were pears of intense struggle on a most important
front &#8211; the ideological front.</P>
<P><EM> The second period</EM> of the second emigration, the years
1911 to 1914, witnessed the rising tide of the movement in Russia.
The growing strike movement, the Lena events, which roused
the whole working class to action, the development of the labour
press, the elections to the Duma and the activity of the
Social-Democratic deputies &#8211; all this called into being new forms
of Party work, gave that work quite a new scope, made the Party
membership far more proletarian, and brought the Party closer to
the masses.</P>
<p>
Contacts with Russia began to strengthen swiftly, and the
influence on the work in Russia steadily increased. The Prague
Conference held in January 1912 expelled the Liquidators from the
Party and laid down the foundations Of the illegal Party
organization. Plekhanov did not join the Bolsheviks.</P>
<P>In 1912 we moved to Cracow. The struggle for the Party and for
its consolidation was no longer waged between small groups
abroad. The Cracow period was one in which Lenin's tactics had
been put to the test in Russia and proved their value in
practice. The questions of practical work absorbed Lenin
completely. But while the working-class movement was developing
widely in Russia, the murmurings of all approaching storm could
already be heard on the international front. The war clouds were
gathering. Ilyich now began to give his attention to the new
relationships that would have to be established between the
different nationalities when the war that was then brewing would
be converted into a civil war. While living in Cracow Ilyich was
able to come into closer contact with the Polish Social-Democrats
and to learn their point of view on the national question. He
persistently combatted their mistakes and gave more definite and
clearer point to his own formulations. During the Cracow period
the Bolsheviks adopted a number of resolutions on the national
question, which were of very great significance.</P>
<p>
<EM>The third period</EM> of the second emigration
(1914-1917) covers the war period, when the whole character of our
life abroad underwent another sharp change. This was the period
when international issues assumed decisive importance, and when
our own Russian affairs could be dealt with only from the point
of view of the international movement.</P>
<p>
Inevitably, they were to be based on much wider ground now,
on international ground. Everything a man could do while living in
a neutral country was done in the way of propaganda for the
struggle against the imperialist war and for converting this war
into civil war, and for laying the foundations for a new
International. This work absorbed all Lenin's energies during the
early years of the war (the end of 1914 and throughout 1915).</P>
<p>
Simultaneously, the events around him suggested to Lenin
some new ideas. They impelled him to a deeper study of the
questions of imperialism, of the nature of the war, of the new
forms of state power that would take shape the day after the
proletariat achieved victory, of the application of the dialectic
method to the policy and tactics of the working class. We moved
from Berne to Zurich, where there were better facilities for
work. Ilyich started writing, and spent all day in the libraries
until the news of the February Revolution came, and we started
to make preparations for returning to Russia.</p>
