<H4>Krupskaya's &#8220;Reminiscences of Lenin&#8221;</H4>
<H1>
Introduction</h1>
<hr class="end">
<BR>
<P>
The reminiscences printed in this volume cover the period 1894
to 1917 from the time I first met Vladimir Ilyich up to the
October Revolution. I have often been told that my reminiscences
are rather sketchy. Everyone, of course, is eager to learn all
he can about Ilyich, and besides, the epoch itself was one of
tremendous historical importance. It saw the development of a
mass movement among the workers, the creation of a strong
staunch party of the working class, steeled under the most
difficult conditions of underground activity and the steady
growth of working-class consciousness and organization. It was
an epoch of desperate struggle, which ended in the victory of
the proletarian socialist revolution.</P>
<p>
Heaps of interesting articles and books could be written both
about that epoch and about Ilyich. The purpose of
these reminiscences is to give a picture of the conditions under which Vladimir Ilyich lived and worked.</P>
<p>
I wrote only of those things which stood out most vividly in
my memory. These reminiscences were written in two stages. Part I,
covering the period 1894-1907, was written a few years after
Lenin's death. It contains recollections relating to his work in
St. Petersburg, to the time of his Siberian exile, the Munich and
London periods of his first emigration, the period preceding the
Second Congress of the Party, the Second Congress itself and the
period immediately following it right up to 1905. Then come
recollections of 1905 both in Russia and abroad, and finally of
the period 1905-1907. I wrote them for the most part at Gorki,
where I roamed about the large house and the overgrown paths of
the park in which Ilyich had spent the last year of his life. The
years 1894-1907 saw the upsurge of the young working-class
movement, and one's thoughts were involuntarily drawn back to that
period, when the foundations of our Party were laid. I wrote the
first part almost entirely from memory. The second part was
written a few years later.</P>
<p>
One had to study very hard during those years, to reread
Lenin sedulously, to learn to link up the past with the present,
to learn how to live with Ilyich without Ilyich. And so the second
part of the book differs from the first. The first has a more
personal touch, the second deals more with Ilyich's interests and
thoughts. I think both parts should preferably be read
together. The first part is closely linked with the second, and
the latter, if read alone, may strike the reader as being less
"reminiscential" than it really is.</P>
<p>
Part II of the reminiscences was written at a time when many
other recollections and symposiums, as well as the second edition
of Lenin's <EM>Works</EM>, had come off the press. This, to a
certain extent, determined the character of the reminiscences of
the second period of emigration. It enabled me to check up on
myself. Moreover, the period they deal with (1908-1917) was far
more complex than the first.</P>
<p>
The first period (1893-1907) covered the early steps of the
working-class movement, the efforts to build up a Party, the
rising wave of the first revolution directed chiefly against
tsarism, and the defeat of that revolution.</P>
<p>
The second period &#8211; that of the second emigration &#8211; was far
more involved. It was a summing up of the revolutionary struggle
of the first period, a period of struggle against the reaction, a
period of fierce struggle against
opportunism of every kind and description, a struggle for the necessity of adapting our work to every kind of condition without any falling off in its revolutionary content. </P>
<P>The period of second emigration was a period of impending world
war, when opportunism in the working-class parties led to the
collapse of the Second International, when entirely new problems
faced the world proletariat, when new paths had to be laid, and
the foundation of the Third International built up stone by
stone, when the struggle for socialism had to be started under the
most adverse conditions. In emigration, all these problems were
sharply focussed and concrete.</P>
<p>
Unless these problems are understood it is impossible for
anyone to grasp how Lenin rose to be the leader of October, the
leader of the world revolution. Leaders are formed in and grow out
of the struggle, from which they draw their strength. No
reminiscences of Lenin during the period of emigration are
conceivable that do not link up every detail of his life with the
struggle that he waged at that time.</p>
<p>
The nine years of his second emigration had not changed Ilyich
a bit. He worked just as hard and as methodically, he took the
same keen interest in every little detail, was able to put two and
two together and had lost none of his ability to see the truth and
face it, no matter how bitter it was. He hated oppression and
exploitation as cordially as ever, was just as devoted to the
cause of the proletariat, the cause of the working people, and
took their interests just as closely to heart. His whole life was
bound up with that cause. It came naturally to him, he could not
live in any other way. He fought opportunism and all and every
backdown as passionately and sharply as ever. He was still capable
of breaking with his closest friends if he saw them acting as a
drag on the movement; he would go up to yesterday's opponent in a
simple comradely way, if it was essential to the cause, and say
what he had to say frankly and bluntly as he had always done. He
was just as fond of nature, of the spring woods, the mountain
oaths and lakes, the noise of the big cities, the working-class
crowd; he loved his comrades, movement, struggle, life in all its
numerous facets. The same Ilyich, except that, watching him day
by day, one would notice that he had become more reticent, still
more kindly towards people, and that he would often lapse into
meditation, roused from which his eyes would have a fleeting
shadow of sadness in them.</P>
<p>
Those years of emigration had been trying ones, and had taken
their toll of Ilyich's strength. But they had moulded a fighter
out of him, the kind of fighter the masses needed to lead them to
victory.</P>
