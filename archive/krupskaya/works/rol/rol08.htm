The Year 1905</h1>

<p>
In his pamphlet <EM>The Zemstvo Campaign</EM> and
<EM>"Iskra's" Plan,</EM> written as far back as November 1904, and
in his subsequent articles written in December in Nos. 1-3 of<EM>
Vperyod,</EM> Ilyich had said that the hour of the masses' real
open fight for freedom was approaching. He had clearly felt the
gathering of the revolutionary storm. But it was one thing to feel
it coming and another to learn that the revolution had already
started. Therefore, when the news of January 9 reached Geneva,
news telling of the concrete form in which the revolution had
started, everything around us seemed to change, as if everything
that had existed until then had suddenly receded into the distant
past. The news of the events of January 9 reached Geneva the next
morning. Vladimir Ilyich and I were going to the library when we
met the Lunacharskys, who were on their way to us. I remember
the figure of Anna Lunacharskaya, who waved her muff at us, too
excited to speak. Instinct drew us, together with all the other
Bolsheviks who had heard the news, to the emigrants' restaurant
kept by the Lepeshinskys. We sought each other's company. But
hardly a word was spoken &#8211; we were all so excited. We sang the
revolutionary funeral march <EM>You Have Fallen
in the Struggle.</EM>.. with grim set faces. The realization
came over everyone in a wave that the revolution had begun, that the shackles of faith in the tsar had been torn apart, and the hour was near when "tyranny shall fall, and the people shall rise up, great, powerful and free...."</P>
<P>We lived at one with all the Russian political emigrants in
Geneva &#8211; from one number of the <EM>Tribune</EM> to the next. All
Ilyich's thoughts were centred in Russia.</P>
<p>
Presently Gapon arrived in Geneva. He was taken up first by
the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who tried to make out that Gapon
was their man, and that the whole labour movement in
St. Petersburg was their handiwork, too. They boosted Gapon and
made a terrible fuss of him. Gapon was in the limelight at that
time and the London <EM>Times</EM> paid him fabulous sums for
every line he wrote.</P>
<p>
Some time after Gapon's arrival in Geneva a
Socialist-Revolutionary lady called one evening and told Vladimir
Ilyich that Gapon wished to meet him. A rendezvous was arranged on
"neutral" ground in a cafe. That evening Vladimir Ilyich paced up
and down his room without lighting the lamp.</P>
<p>
Gapon was a living part of the growing revolution in Russia, a
man closely bound up with the working-class masses who
implicitly believed in him. Ilyich was excited at the prospect of
meeting that man.</P>
<p>
One comrade was recently shocked to learn that Vladimir Ilyich had had to do with Gapon.</P>
<p>
Of course, one could simply have dismissed Gapon by deciding
beforehand that nothing good could ever be expected of a
priest. That is what Plekhanov did. He gave Gapon a very cool
reception. But Lenin's strength lay in
the fact that to him the revolution was a living thing, like a face that one could study in all its varied features, because he knew and understood what the masses wanted. And a knowledge of the masses can only be obtained by contact with them. Ilyich was curious to know what influence Gapon could have had upon the masses.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich related his impressions of Gapon after
returning from the meeting. Gapon was still red-hot from the
breath of the revolution. Speaking about the St. Petersburg
workers, he stormed against the Tsar and his myrmidons. Naive
though his indignation was in many ways, it was none the less
honest. It was in keeping with the mood of the working-class
masses. "He has a lot to learn, though," Vladimir Ilyich said. "I
told him:'Don't you listen to flattery, my dear man. If you don't
study, that is where you'll be' &#8211; and I pointed under the table."</p>
<P>On February 8 Vladimir Ilyich wrote in No. 7 of
<EM>Vperyod:</EM> "Let us hope that G. Gapon, who has had such
acute personal experience of the change-over from views of a
politically unconscious people to revolutionary views, will
succeed in achieving that clarity of revolutionary outlook which
is essential in a political leader." </P>
<p>
Gapon never achieved that clarity. He was the son of a rich
Ukrainian peasant, and never lost touch with his family and his
village. He knew the peasants' needs, and his speech was simple
and familiar to the uneducated working masses. Very likely it
was this origin of his, these links with the countryside, that
accounted for his success; but it would be difficult to imagine
anyone more thoroughly imbued with the priest psychology than
Gapon was. He had never had any contact with revolutionary circles
before, and was by nature not a revolutionary, but a sly priest,
who was ready to accept any compromises Once he related: "At one
time I started having doubts, and my faith was shaken. I got quite
ill and went to the Crimea. There was an old man there who was
said to live a holy life. I went to see him so's to strengthen my
faith. I came to the old man. People were gathered by a stream,
pad the old man was conducting a service. There was a
little dent in that stream where St. George's steed was supposed to have stepped. That's nonsense, of course. The point is, I said to myself, this old man has profound faith. I went up to him after the service to get his blessing, and he slips out of his vestment and says: 'We've opened a candle-shop here and are doing a good trade!' There's faith for you! I got home more dead than alive. I had a friend then, the artist Vereshchagin. He says: 'Why don't you chuck up this priest business!' I thought &#8211; well, at home
my parents are looked up to, my father is the village elder, everyone respects him, and then everyone will point and
say &#8211; your sons unfrocked. No, I didn't do it." </P>
<P>That was Gapon all over.</P>
<p>
He was no good at studying. He spent a lot of time learning
target shooting and horseback riding, but when it came to books
it did not work. True, on Ilyich's advice, he started to read
Plekhanov's works, but did so as a matter of duty. He was unable
to study from books. He was unable to learn from life
either. The priest mentality blinded him. On his return to
Russia he backslid into the mire of <EM>agent provocateur</EM>
activities.</P>
<p>
From the very first days of the revolution Ilyich had seen the
whole thing in clear perspective. He realized that the movement
would now grow like an avalanche, that the revolutionary people
would not stop half-way, and that the workers would throw
themselves into the fight against the autocracy. Whether they
would win or lose, the outcome of that fight would show. In order
to win they would have to be well armed.</P>
<p>
Ilyich always had a remarkable flair for deeply sensing the
moods of the working class at a given moment.</P>
<p>
Taking their cue from the liberal bourgeoisie, who had
not got moving yet, the Mensheviks talked about "untying" the revolution, whereas Ilyich knew that the workers were already determined to fight to the bitter end. And he was with them. He knew that there could be no stopping half. way, that this would so demoralize the working class, so weaken the impetus of their struggle and do such tremendous damage to the cause, that it was not to be thought of under any circumstances. History showed that in the Revolution of 1905 the working class was defeated but not vanquished. Its will to fight was not broken. This is what some people failed to understand, people who had attacked Lenin for his "downright views" and who had had nothing better to say after the defeat than that "they should not have taken to arms." If one was to remain true to one's class, it was impossible not to take to arms, it was impossible for the vanguard to leave its fighting class in the lurch.</P>
<p>
And Ilyich was constantly calling upon the working-class
vanguard &#8211; the Party &#8211; to fight, to organize, to work for the
arming of the masses. He wrote of this in <EM>Vperyod</EM>, and
in his letters to Russia.</P>
<p>
"January 9, 1905 revealed all the gigantic reserves of
revolutionary proletarian energy, and at the same time the utter
inadequacy of the Social-Democratic organization," Vladimir Ilyich
wrote at the beginning of February in his article <EM>Should We
Organize the Revolution?</EM>, every line of which is a clarion
call to pass from words to deeds.</P>
<p>
Ilyich had not only reread and very carefully studied and
thought over all that Marx and Engels had written about revolution
and insurrection, but had read many books dealing with the art of
warfare, made a thorough study of the technique and organization
of armed insurrection. He had given more thought to this than
people know, and his talk about fighting squads in partisan war,
about the squads of "five and ten," was not just the idle talk of
a layman, but a well-thought-out plan.</P>
<p>
The librarian at the Societe de lecture was a witness of how
a Russian revolutionary in cheap trousers with the bottoms turned
up against the mud in Swiss style (he had forgotten to turn them
down) would come early every morning, take the book on barricade
fighting or the technique of attack left over from the day before,
sit down with it at his customary place by the window, pat the
sparse hair on his bald head with an habitual gesture, and become
deeply absorbed in reading. Sometimes he would get up to take down
a big dictionary to look up some unfamiliar term, then pace up and
down a bit, and resume his seat at the desk, where he would start
writing swiftly in a small hand on quarter sheets of paper with an
air of deep absorption.</P>
<p>
The Bolsheviks sought all possible means of sending weapons to
Russia, but all this was a mere drop in the ocean. A Fighting
Committee was set up in Russia (in St. Petersburg), but it worked
too slow. Ilyich wrote to St. Petersburg:</P>
<p>
"In an affair of this kind the last thing we need are
schemes, and discussions and talk about the functions of the
Fighting Committee and its rights. What we need is furious energy,
and still more energy. I am horrified, absolutely horrified, to
see people talking bombs for over six months and not a single bomb
made yet. And those who do the talking are most learned
people.... Go to the youth, gentlemen! That is the only saving
remedy. Otherwise, take my word, you will be late (I can see this
plainly), and will find yourselves with 'scientific' transactions,
plans, drawings, schemes and excellent recipes, but without an
organization, without anything to do.... For God's sake, never
mind all the formalities and schemes, send all those 'functions,
rights and privileges' to the devil." </P>
<p>
The Bolsheviks, in fact, did a great deal in the way of
preparing the armed uprising. They often displayed wonderful
heroism, and risked their lives every minute. Preparation of the
armed uprising &#8211; such was the slogan of the Bolsheviks. Gapon, too,
spoke about an armed uprising.</P>
<p>
Shortly after his arrival he submitted a proposal for a
militant agreement between the revolutionary parties. An appraisal
of Gapon's proposal and a full examination of the whole question
of militant agreements were given by Vladimir Ilyich in No. 7 of
<EM>Vperyod</EM> for February 8, 1905.</P>
<p>
Gapon undertook to supply arms to the St. Petersburg
workers. All kinds of donations had been put at his disposal, and
he used the money to buy weapons in England. All arrangements had
been made at last. A ship was found &#8211; the <EM>John
Grafton</EM> &#8211; whose skipper agreed to take a cargo of arms and
discharge it on one of the islands near the Russian
frontier. Gapon had no idea how illegal shipments were made, and
thought it much simpler than it really was. He received an illegal
passport from us and secret addresses and left for St. Petersburg
to organize the business. To Vladimir Ilyich this whole enterprise
was a passing from words to deeds. The workers had to receive arms
at all costs. Nothing came of the enterprise, however. The
<EM>Grafton</EM> ran aground, and in any case, approach to the
island proved to be impossible. Gapon was unable to do anything
in St. Petersburg either. He had to hide in the working-class
slums and live under an assumed name. It was terribly difficult to
contact people, and the addresses of the Socialist-Revolutionaries
with whom arrangements had to be made for taking delivery of the
consignments proved to be mythical. The Bolsheviks had been the
only ones to send their people out to the island. All this had a
stunning effect on Gapon. It was one thing to address crowded
meetings without running any risks, and quite another thing to
live underground, half-starving and not daring to show one's face
anywhere. It needed people of quite a different revolutionary
mould to organize illegal shipments of arms, people who were
prepared to make any sacrifice in utter obscurity.</P>
<p>
Another slogan advanced by Ilyich was that of support to the
peasants' struggle for land. It would enable the working class to
lean on the peasantry in their struggle Vladimir Ilyich always
gave a great deal of attention to the peasant question. During the
discussion of the Party programme at the Second Congress Vladimir
Ilyich had put forward and strongly advocated the slogan of
restoring to the peasants the otrezki of which they had been
deprived during the Reform of 1861.</P>
<p>
He believed that in order to win over the peasantry a
concrete demand that would meet the peasantry's most urgent need
had to be put forward. The peasantry had to be rallied around a
concrete slogan as had been done in the case of the workers, when
the Social-Democrats had launched their agitation among them with
a campaign for tea service, for reducing working hours, and paying
wages punctually.</P>
<p>
The events of 1905 induced Ilyich to re-examine this
question. His talks with Gapon (a peasant by origin, who had not
lost touch with the village), with Matyushenko, a sailor off the
<EM>Potemkin,</EM> and with a number of workers who had arrived
from Russia and had first-hand knowledge of what was going on in
the countryside, showed Ilyich that the otrezki slogan was no
longer adequate, that a wider slogan than that was needed &#8211; one
calling for the confiscation of the landowners' estates, and all
the crown and church lands. Not for nothing had Vladimir Ilyich
once delved into statistical reference books and fully established
the economic connection between town and country, between big and
small industry, between the working class and the peasantry. He
saw that the time had come when this economic connection would
serve the Proletariat as a lever of powerful political influence
upon the peasantry. He held the proletariat to be the only
consistently revolutionary class.</P>
<p>
I remember an amusing incident, when Gapon once asked
Vladimir Ilyich to listen to an appeal which he had written. He
began to read it out with great fervour. The appeal was full of
abusive terms against the Tsar. "We want no tsar," it ran, "let
there be one master over the land &#8211; God, with all of you his
tenants!" (At that time the peasant movement still had as its main
objective a reduction in land rents.) Vladimir Ilyich burst out
laughing. Naive though the figure of speech was, it revealed most
strikingly the very traits that made Gapon stand so close to the
masses: himself a peasant, he had stirred up in the workers, who
were still half connected with the village, their age-old hunger
for the land.</P>
<p>
Gapon was put out by Vladimir Ilyich's laughter. "If it isn't
right, tell me and I'll alter it," he said. Vladimir Ilyich became
grave at once. "I'm afraid that wouldn't be of any use," he
said. "My whole train of thought is different. Write it in your
own way, in your own style." I remember another scene. It was
after the Third Congress, after the mutiny on the
<EM>Potemkin.</EM> The crew had been interned in Rumania and were
having a very hard time. Gapon had received a lot of money for his
memoirs and by way of donations for the cause of the revolution,
and he spent days on end running about buying clothes for the men
of the <EM>Potemkin.</EM> The sailor Matyushenko, one of the most
prominent participants in the mutiny, arrived in Geneva. He made
friends with Gapon right away and the two of them were
inseparable.</P>
<p>
A young fellow came from Moscow about the same time (I forget
his name now), a red-cheeked young salesman in a bookshop, who had
recently joined the Social-Democrats. He had come on a Party
errand from Moscow. He told us how and why he had become a
Social-Democrat, and then began to enlarge on the subject of why
he thought the programme of the Social-Democratic Party to be
correct, expounding it point by point with the fervour of the
convert. Vladimir Ilyich found it boring and went out to the
library, leaving me to give the young man tea and get what I could
out of him. The young man continued expounding the programme. Just
then Gapon and Matyushenko arrived. I was about to offer them some
tea, too, when the young man got to the clause dealing with the
otrezki. On hearing this and the young man's argument that the
peasants should not go beyond fighting for the recovery of the
otrezki, Matyushenko flared up and shouted: "All the land to the
people!"</P>
<p>
I do not know how far things would have gone if Ilyich had not
returned just then. He immediately grasped what the argument was
about, but instead of going into the matter, he bore Gapon and
Matyushenko off to his room. I got rid of the young man as quickly
as I could.</P>
<p>
A sweeping revolutionary movement was rising among the
peasantry. At the December Conference in Tammerfors Ilyich had
moved that the clause concerning the otrezki should be struck out
of the programme altogether. A clause was inserted instead calling
for support to the revolutionary measures of the peasantry,
including confiscation of landowners', government, church,
monastic and crown lands.</P>
<p>
The German Social-Democrat Kautsky, who was then a very
influential figure, took a different view of the case. He wrote in
<EM>Neue Zeit</EM> at the time that the urban revolutionary
movement in Russia should remain neutral on the question of the
relations between the peasantry and the landowners.</P>
<p>
Kautsky is now one of the most outstanding betrayers of the
workers' cause, but at that time he was considered to be a
revolutionary Social-Democrat, When Bernstein, another German
Social-Democrat, raised the banner
against Marxism at the end of the nineties by trying to prove that Marx's teaching needed revising, that much of it was out of date, and that the aim (socialism) was nothing, and the movement everything, Kautsky then came out against him in defence of Marx's teachings. As a result, Kautsky in those days enjoyed the reputation of being one of the most revolutionary and consistent of Marx's disciples. Kautsky's assertion, however, did not shake Ilyich's conviction that the Russian revolution could win only if it had the backing of the peasantry.</P>
<p>
Kautsky's statement induced Ilyich to check up whether
Kautsky was correctly presenting the case for Marx and Engels. He
began to study Marx's views on the agrarian movement in America in
1848, and Engels views on Henry George in 1885. April already saw
the publication of Vladimir Ilyich's article "Marx on the American
'Redistribution.' "</P>
<p>
He ends this article with the words: "There is hardly another
country in the world where the peasantry is experiencing such
suffering, such oppression and degradation as in Russia. The more
dismal this oppression of the peasantry has been, the more
powerful will now be its awakening, the more invincible its
revolutionary onslaught. It is the business of the class conscious
revolutionary proletariat to support this onslaught with all
its might, so that it may leave no stone standing of this old,
accursed, feudal and autocratic slavish Russia, so that it may
create a new generation of bold and free people, a new republican
country in which our proletarian struggle for socialism will have
room to expand." </P>
<p>
The Bolshevik centre in Geneva stood on the corner of the
famous Rue de Carouge &#8211; a street inhabited by Russian political
emigrants &#8211; and the Arve embankment. The<EM> Vperyod</EM>
editorial and dispatch offices, the Lepeshinskys' Bolshevik
restaurant, and the apartments of the Bonch-Bruyeviches, the
Lyadovs (Mandelstams) and the Ilyins were in the same
building. Regular visitors at Bonch-Bruyeviches' were Orlovsky,
Olminsky and others. Bogdanov, who returned from Russia, had made
arrangements for Lunacharsky to come to Geneva to join the
editorial staff of <EM>Vperyod.</EM> Lunacharsky proved to
be a brilliant speaker, and did much towards strengthening the
Bolshevik positions. Vladimir Ilyich became very friendly with him
from then on and enjoyed his company. He was rather partial to him
during his differences with the <EM>Vperyod-</EM>ists. As a matter
of fact, Lunacharsky was always more than usually gay and witty in
his presence. I remember an occasion &#8211; it was in 1919 or 1920, I
believe &#8211; when Lunacharsky, who had returned from a visit to the
front, described his impressions to Vladimir Ilyich, and the
latter's eyes shone as he listened to him.</P>
<p>
Lunacharsky, Vorovsky, Olminsky &#8211; the <EM>Vperyod </EM>had fine
reinforcements there. Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich, who was the
business manager, went about beaming, full of grandiose schemes,
for ever busy with the printing plant.</P>
<p>
The Bolsheviks gathered almost every evening at the Cafe
Landolt, and sat there for hours over a glass of beer, discussing
events in Russia and making plans.</P>
<P>Many comrades had left for Russia, and many more were preparing to leave.</P>
<p>
There was an agitation in Russia for a Third Congress. Many
changes had taken place there since the Second Congress, and the
new questions that had come up in the course of the daily struggle
made a congress absolutely essential. Most of the committees were
in favour of a congress. A Bureau of Majority Committees was
formed. The Central Committee had co-opted a host of new members,
including Mensheviks. It was in the main a conciliatory body, and
hindered the convocation of the Third Congress in every way it
could. After the raid on the Central Committee at the Moscow flat
of Leonid Andreyev, the author, the unarrested members of the
C.C. consented to the convocation of the congress.</P>
<p>
The congress was held in London. The Bolsheviks had an obvious
majority there, and so the Mensheviks kept away. Their delegates
gathered at a conference of their own in Geneva.</P>
<p>
The C.C. delegates from Russia were Sommer (alias
Mark &#8211; Lyubimov) and Winter (Krasin). Mark was very gloomy, but
Krasin looked just as if nothing had happened. The delegates
furiously attacked the C.C. for its conciliatory stand. Mark sat
as black as a thundercloud and said nothing. Krasin was silent,
too, chin in hand, looking entirely unperturbed, as though all
those vitriolic speeches did not concern him in the least. When
his turn came, he made his report in a calm voice without even
mentioning the attacks. Everyone understood that he had had a
conciliatory bias, but that that had now passed, and from now on
he had taken his stand with the Bolsheviks in whose ranks he would
march to the end.</P>
<p>
Party members now know the big and responsible job which
Krasin did during the Revolution of 1905, when he had helped to
arm the fighting ranks, directed the training of the fighting
squads, and so forth. All this had been done in secret, without
any fuss, but the amount of energy that had gone into its doing
was tremendous. Vladimir Ilyich knew more about this work than
anybody else, and since then had always had a very high opinion of
Krasin.</P>
<p>
Four men came from the Caucasus &#8211; Mikha Tskhakaya, Alyosha
Japaridze, Leman and Kamenev. There were only three
mandates. Vladimir Ilyich wanted to know whose they were and
how it was that four delegates had come on three
mandates. Who had received the majority of votes? Mikha protested:
"Whoever heard of anyone voting in the Caucasus! We settle all our
business in a comradely way. Four of us have been sent, and the
number of man dates doesn't matter." Mikha was the oldest member
at the congress, and it was he who opened it. The Polesye
Committee was represented by Lyova Vladimirov. We had often
written to him in Russia about the split and never received any
reply. In response to our letters describing the tricks the
Martovists were up to we had received letters telling us what
leaflets had been distributed and how many, and what strikes and
demonstrations there had been in Polesye. At the congress he
showed himself a staunch Bolshevik.</P>
<p>
Other delegates from Russia included Bogdanov, Postolovsky
(Vadim), P. P. Rumyantsev, Rykov, Sammer, Zemlyachka,
Litvinov, Skrypnik, Bur (A. E. Essen), Shklovsky and
Kramolnikov.</P>
<p>
Everything at the congress pointed to the fact that the
workers' movement in Russia was in full swing. Resolutions were
passed on various questions, such as the armed uprising, a
provisional revolutionary government, the attitude towards the
government's tactics on the eve of the uprising, the question of
open action by the R.S.D.L.P., the attitude towards the peasant
movement, the attitude towards the liberals and the
Social-Democratic organizations of the non-Russian nationalities,
propaganda and agitation, the breakaway Party group, and so
on.</P>
<p>
The report on the agrarian question was made by Vladimir
Ilyich, and on his motion the clause on otrezki was referred to
the commentaries, while first-place prominence was given to the
question of confiscating the lands of the landowners, the church
and the crown.</P>
<p>
Two other issues characteristic of the Third Congress were
the question of two centres and the question of the relations
between the workers and the intellectuals.</P>
<p>
The predominating element at the Second Congress had been the
literary intellectuals and practical Party workers, who had done a
good deal for the Party one way or another but who had very weak
ties with the organizations in Russia, which were then only just
beginning to take shape.</P>
<p>
The Third Congress was of quite a different character. The
organizations in Russia definitely existed already in the shape of
illegal local committees, which were obliged to work under
extremely difficult conditions of secrecy. As a result, these
committees everywhere practically had no workers among their
membership, although they had a great influence on the workers'
movement. The committees' leaflets and instructions reflected the
mood of the working-class masses, who felt that they now had a
leadership. The committees therefore were very popular with them,
and for most of the workers their activities were cloaked in a
veil of mystery. The workers often got together on their own apart
from the intellectuals to discuss the fundamental issues of the
movement. The Third Congress received a statement by fifty Odessa
workers setting forth the main points of difference between the
Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks, and mentioning that not a single
intellectual had been present at the meeting where this question
was discussed.</P>
<p>
The "committeeman" was usually a rather self-assured
person. He saw what a tremendous influence the work of the
committee had on the masses, and as a rule he recognized no
inner-Party democracy. "Inner-Party democracy only leads to
trouble with the police. We are connected with the movement as it
is," the "committeemen" would say. Inwardly they rather despised
the Party workers abroad, who, in their opinion, had nothing
better to do than squabble among themselves &#8211; "they ought to be
made to work under Russian conditions." The "committeemen"
objected to the overruling influence of the Centre abroad. At the
same time they did not want innovations. They were neither
desirous nor capable of adjusting themselves to the quickly
changing conditions.</P>
<p>
The "committeemen" had done a tremendous job during the period
of 1904-1905, but many of them found it extremely difficult to
adjust themselves to the conditions of increasing legal facilities
and methods of open struggle.</P>
<p>
There were no workers at the Third Congress &#8211; at least, none
of any mark. The Babushkin who attended the congress was not
the worker of that name, who was in Siberia at the time, but was
the alias used by Shklovsky, as far as I remember. There was no
scarcity of "committeemen" though. Unless this make-up of the
congress is borne in mind a great deal of what the congress
records contain will not be properly understood.</P>
<p>
The question of "bringing to heel the Centre abroad" was
raised by prominent Party workers besides the "committeemen." The
opposition to this Centre was headed by Bogdanov.</P>
<p>
A lot was said that were better left unsaid, but Vladimir
Ilyich did not take it much to heart. He considered that the
significance of the emigrants' Centre was diminishing hourly with
the developing revolution. He knew that his own days abroad were
"numbered," and his principal concern was that the Central
Committee (in Russia) should promptly inform the Central Organ as
to what was going on (the Central Organ was henceforth to be
called <EM>Proletary</EM> and to be published abroad for the time
being). He also urged that regular meetings should be arranged
between the sections of the Central Committee in Russia and
abroad.</P>
<p>
The question of drawing workers into the committees was a
sharper issue. Vladimir Ilyich warmly supported the
idea. Bogdanov, the emigrants' Centre members and the writers were
also in favour of it. The "committeemen" were against it. Both
Vladimir Ilyich and the "committeemen" argued heatedly. The
"committeemen" insisted that no resolution should be passed on
this question &#8211; one could not very well carry a resolution to the
effect that workers were not to be drawn into the committees! </P>
<P>Speaking in the debates, Vladimir Ilyich said:</P>
<p>
"I think we ought to take a wider view of the matter. Drawing
workers into the committees is not only a pedagogical but a
political task. The workers have a class instinct, and given a
little political experience they fairly quickly become staunch
Social-Democrats. I would be strongly in favour of having eight
workers on our committees to every two intellectuals. Since the
advice given in literature &#8211; that workers were to be drawn into the
committees wherever possible &#8211; proved to be insufficient, then it
would be expedient for such advice to be given in the name of the
congress. If you have a clear and definite directive of the
congress you will have a radical means for combatting demagogy:
that is the clear will of the congress." </P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich had repeatedly urged the necessity of drawing
as many workers as possible into the committees. He had written
about it as far back as 1903 in his <EM>Letter to a Comrade.</EM>
And now, defending the same view at the congress, he became
terribly excited and heckled his opponents. When Mikhailov
(Postolovsky) said: "In practice, then, very little is required of
intellectuals, and far too much of workers," Vladimir Ilyich cried
out: "Quite right! This was greeted by the "committeemen" with a
chorussed "It's wrong!"</P>
<p>
When Rumyantsev said: "The St. Petersburg Committee has only
one worker on it, despite the fact that it has been working for
fifteen years," Vladimir Ilyich shouted, Shame!"</P>
<p>
Afterwards, at the close of the debates, Ilyich said: "I could
not sit calmly listening to people saying there were no workers
fit to be members of the committees. It's just dodging the issue;
obviously, this is an unhealthy symptom. The workers must be
drawn into the committees." The only reason why Ilyich was not
greatly upset st his point of view receiving such a severe rebuff
at the congress was because he realized that the approaching
revolution was bound to radically cure the Party of this
incapacity to give the committees a more pronounced worker
make-up.</P>
<p>
Another important question before the congress was that of propaganda and agitation.</P>
<p>
I remember a girl coming from Odessa who complained that "The
workers are demanding the impossible of the focal committee &#8211; they
want us to give them propaganda. Wow can we? We can only give them
agitation!"</P>
<p>
The girl's statement made quite an impression on Ilyich. It
served, as it were, as an introduction to the debate on
propaganda. The old forms of propaganda &#8211; as could be gathered from
the speeches of Zemlyachka, Mikha Tskhakaya and Desnitsky &#8211; were
dead, and propaganda bed turned into agitation. With the colossal
growth of the working-class movement verbal propaganda and even
agitation as a whole could not meet the needs of the
movement. What was wanted was popular literature, a popular
newspaper, literature for the peasants and for the non-Russian
nationalities.</P>
<p>
Life raised a hundred and one new questions which could not
be decided within the limits of the old illegal
organizations. They could only be dealt with by setting up a daily
newspaper in Russia and wide facilities for legal
publishing. Freedom of the press, however, had still to be won. It
was decided to publish an illegal newspaper in Russia and form a
group of writers there whose duty it would be to take care of the
publication of a popular paper. It was clear nevertheless that all
these measures were mere palliatives.</P>
<p>
A good deal was said at the congress about the rising
revolutionary struggle. Resolutions were adopted concerning the
events in Poland and the Caucasus. "The movement is steadily
spreading," said the delegate from the Urals. "It's high time we
left off regarding the Urals as a backward sleepy region that was
incapable of moving. The political strike in Lysva, the numerous
strikes at the factories, and a variety of signs indicative of a
revolutionary mood, which even goes to the extent of agrarian and
factory terror in the form of all kinds of small spontaneous
demonstrations &#8211; all these go to show that the Urals is on the
verge of a big revolutionary movement. It is highly probable
that this movement in the Urals will take the form of an armed
uprising. The Urals was the first place where the workers used
bombs and even brought out guns (at the Votkinsk Works). Comrades,
don't forget the Urals!"</P>
<p>
It goes without saying, Vladimir Ilyich had long talks with the Urals delegate.</P>
<p>
On the whole the Third Congress correctly laid down the line
of struggle. The same questions were decided by the Mensheviks
quite differently. The fundamental differences between the
resolutions of the Third Congress and those of the Menshevik
Conference were dealt with by Vladimir Ilyich in his pamphlet
<EM>Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic
Revolution.</EM></P>
<p>
We returned to Geneva. I had been elected to the committee
for editing the congress minutes together with Kamsky and
Orlovsky. Kamsky went away, and Orlovsky was very
busy. Verification of the congress minutes was organized in
Geneva, where quite a number of delegates had come after the
congress. There were no stenographers in those days nor special
secretaries, and the minutes were taken down in turn by two
members of the congress, and
afterwards handed to me. Not all the delegates were good secretaries. It goes without saying, there was no time to report the minutes at the congress. We went over them together with the delegates in Geneva at the Lepeshinskys' restaurant. Naturally, every delegate found that his thoughts had not been recorded correctly and wished to make insertions in the text. This was not allowed, however. Amendments could only be made if the other delegates agreed that they were warranted. It was very hard work, and not without the usual element of friction. Skrypnik (Shchensky) wanted to take the minutes home with him, and when I pointed out that in that case they would have to be given to everybody else and that there would be nothing left of them, he got angry and wrote a print-hand protest to the Central Committee.</P>
<p>
When this work was finished in the rough Orlovsky, too, spent
a good deal more time, editing the minutes.</P>
<p>
In July we received the first minutes of the meetings of the
new Central Committee. They reported that the Mensheviks in Russia
disagreed with Iskra, and would also conduct a boycott, and that
although the C.C. had discussed the question of support to the
peasant movement it had not done anything yet as it wanted to
consult the agronomists.</P>
<p>
The letter struck us as being vexatiously laconic. The next
letter about the work of the C.C. was more meagre still. Ilyich
fretted very much. After that whiff of Russian air at the
congress, it was more painful than ever to feel oneself cut off
from the work in Russia.</P>
<p>
In a letter written in the middle of August Ilyich urged the
C.C. to "stop being dumb" and not confine themselves to discussing
questions among themselves. "The C.C. has some kind of internal
defect," he wrote to the C.C. members in Russia.</P>
<p>
In subsequent letters he took them severely to task for not
carrying out the decision to keep the C.O. regularly informed.</P>
<p>
In his September letter addressed to August, Ilyich wrote:
"To wait for complete solidarity in the C.C. or among its agents
is sheer utopia. This is not a coterie but a Party, my dear
fellow!"</P>
<p>
In a letter to Gusev dated October 13, 1905, he pointed out
the necessity of conducting a trade-union struggle simultaneously
with preparations for an armed uprising. This struggle, however,
had to be waged in a Bolshevik spirit and the Mensheviks would
have to be challenged here too.</P>
<p>
The harbingers of freedom of the press began to loom on the
Geneva horizon. Publishers appeared who vied with each other in
offering to legally publish pamphlets issued illegally abroad. The
Odessa Burevestnik, the Malikh and other publishing houses all
offered their services.</P>
<p>
The C.C. asked us to abstain from signing any contracts as
they were planning to set up publishing machinery of their
own.</P>
<p>
The question of Ilyich going to Finland for a meeting with
the C.C. cropped up in the beginning of October, but the
development of events caused a change of plan. Vladimir Ilyich
intended to go to Russia. I was to remain in Geneva a fortnight
longer to wind things up. I helped Ilyich to sort out his papers
and correspondence, and laid them out in envelopes. Ilyich made a
note of the contents on each envelope. All this was packed up in a
suitcase and handed over, I believe, to Karpinsky for
safekeeping. This suitcase was preserved and forwarded to the
Lenin Institute after Ilyich's death. It contained a mass of
documents and letters which throw a vivid light on the history of
the Party.</P>
<P>In September Ilyich wrote to the C.C.:</P>
<p>
"As regards Plekhanov, I am giving you the local rumours for
your information. He is obviously incensed against us for exposing
him before the International Bureau. He swears like a trooper in
No. 2 of the <EM>Diary of a Social-Democrat</EM>. Some rumours say
he is planning a paper of his own, others that he is returning to
<EM>Iskra</EM>. The inference is &#8211; growing mistrust of him on our
part." </P>
<p>
And on October 8 Ilyich continued: "I ask you
earnestly &#8211; please drop the idea of Plekhanov and appoint your own
delegate from the majority.... It would be good to appoint
Orlovsky." </P>
<P>But when, just as Ilyich was about to leave, news came that
there was a possibility of setting up a daily paper in Russia, he
wrote a warm letter to Plekhanov urging him to collaborate. "The
revolution will itself sweep away our tactical differences with
amazing rapidity...." "....All this will create new ground, upon
which it will be easier to forget the past and work together for a
real live cause." Ilyich ended up by asking Plekhanov to meet
him. I do not remember whether that meeting took place or
not. Probably it did not, otherwise I would hardly have forgotten
such an episode. </P>
<P>Plekhanov did not go to Russia in 1905.</P>
<p>
Ilyich made detailed arrangements for his return to Russia
in his letter of October 26. "Upon my word, our revolution in
Russia is a jolly good thing!" he wrote. In reply to a question
about the timing of the uprising, he says:<EM> "I would put off
the uprising till the spring. But we shan't be asked
anyway."</EM></P>
