The Years of New Revolutionary Upsurge 1911-1914</h1>
<H4>Paris</H4>
<H4>1911-1912</H4>
<hr class="end">
<BR>
<P>
The end of 1910 was marked by a revolutionary upsurge. Between
1911 and 1914 every month, right up to the outbreak of the war
in August 1914, saw symptoms of the rising working-class
movement. This movement, however, was now developing under
conditions different from those that prevailed before 1905. It
now had the experience of the 1905 Revolution to go by. The
proletariat was not what it had been. It had behind it an
experience of strikes, of a number of armed uprisings, of a
sweeping mass movement, and years of defeat. That was the crux
of the matter. This made itself evident in all ways, and Ilyich,
who threw himself into the living vortex with all his ardour,
who was always able to decipher the meaning and significance
of every phrase uttered by the worker, felt this growth of the
proletariat in every fibre of his being. On the other hand, he
knew
that not only the proletariat but the whole situation was not what it had been. The intelligentsia had changed too. In 1905 the broad sections of the intelligentsia had supported the workers. Not so now. The nature of the struggle which the proletariat was going to wage was now clear. It was going to be a fierce grim struggle, in which the proletariat would overthrow everything that stood in its way. There was to be no more using the proletariat to fight for a meagre constitution, the way the liberal bourgeoisie wanted. The working class would not have it. It would lead now, and not be led. The conditions of the struggle were different too. The tsarist government had the experience of the 1905 Revolution behind it too. It now had the whole workers organization enmeshed in its network of spies and agent provocateurs. They were not the old type of spies who used to hang around the street corners and whom it was possible to evade. There were now the Malinovskys, the Romanovs, the Brendinskys and the Chernomazovs, who held high Party posts. The business of spying and making arrests was no longer done haphazardly. It was carefully planned.</P>
<p>
These conditions served as a regular breeding-ground for
opportunists of the worst kind. The striving of the Liquidators
to dissolve the Party &#8211; the vanguard of the working class &#8211; was
supported by the wide sections of the intelligentsia. The
Liquidators sprang up right and left like mushrooms. Every other
Cadet tried to take a smack at the illegal Party. It was
impossible not to fight them tooth and nail. The struggle was
unequal though.The Liquidators had a strong legal centre in Russia
and facilities for carrying on broad activities among the masses,
whereas the Bolsheviks had to fight for every inch of ground under
the most difficult conditions of illegal work which then
prevailed.</P>
<p>
The year 1911 started with a break-through of the censorship
barriers on the one hand, and a vigorous struggle for
strengthening the illegal Party organization on the other. The
struggle started inside the united organization abroad, set up at
the January Plenary Meeting in 1910, but soon broke banks and got
out of control.</P>
<p>
The publication of <EM>Zvezda</EM> in St. Petersburg and
<EM>Mysl</EM> in Moscow delighted Ilyich. The smuggling into
Russia of illegal newspapers published abroad was very badly
organized, worse than in 1905. The police had agent provocateurs
everywhere, both in Russia and abroad, and things were always
going wrong because of them. That is why Ilyich was so pleased
at the publication of legal newspapers and magazines in Russia to
which the Bolsheviks could contribute.</P>
<p>
The editorial board of <EM>Zvezda</EM> consisted of
V. Bonch-Bruyevich (Bolshevik), N. Iordansky (a Plekhanovite at
the time), and I. Pokrovsky (a deputy of the Duma who sympathized
with the Bolsheviks). The newspaper was considered the mouthpiece
of the Duma group. The first issue contained an article by
Plekhanov. Vladimir Ilyich was not very pleased with the first
issue &#8211; he thought it rather dull. But then he was delighted with
the first issue of the Moscow <EM>Mysl.</EM></P>
<p>
"All ours, and it pleases me immensely," Ilyich wrote to
Maxim Corky about it. He started writing a lot for
<EM>Zvezda</EM> and <EM>Mysl</EM>. Publishing legal newspapers at
that time was no easy matter. In February Skvortsov-Stepanov was
arrested in Moscow, and Bonch-Bruyevich and Lydia Knipovich in
St. Petersburg. The latter worked together with Poletayev and
others. In April <EM>Mysl</EM> was closed down, and in June
<EM>Zvesda</EM> ceased publication as the organ of the Duma group
after putting out twenty-five issues. <EM>Zvezda</EM> did not
resume Publication until November (No. 26 came out on November
5). By that time it had become definitely Bolshevik. Another
Bolshevik paper <EM>Sovremennaya Zhizn (Contemporary Life)</EM>
began to appear in Baku.</P>
<p>
In July talks were held with Savelyev about the publication
of a legal journal called <EM>Provoeshchenie (Enlightenment)</EM>
in St. Petersburg. Publication of this magazine was not started
until the end of 1911.</P>
<p>
Ilyich closely followed these publications and wrote for them.</P>
<p>
As regards contact with the workers, an attempt was first
made to repeat the Capri experiment with the students of the
Bologna school, but nothing came of it.</P>
<p>
The Otzovists had organized a school in Bologna, Italy, in
November 1910, and the students had invited down various lecturers
including Dan, Plekhanov and Lenin. Vladimir Ilyich refused the
invitation and asked the pupils to come to Paris. Grown wise with
the experience of the Capri school, however, the
<EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists began to fence and demanded an official
invitation from the Bureau of the Central Committee Abroad, in
which the Mensheviks predominated at the time. And when they
arrived in Paris together with the students, who were to
counteract Lenin's influence, they demanded autonomy. In the long
run, no studies were held, and the B.C.C.A. sent the students back
to Russia.</P>
<p>
In the spring of 1911 we succeeded at last in setting up a
Party school of our own near Paris. It was open to workers and
pro-Party-Mensheviks and <EM>Vperyod</EM>-ist workers (Otzovists),
but the two latter elements were a small minority. The first to
arrive at the school were St. Petersburg comrades &#8211; two
metal-workers Belostotsky (Vladimir) and Georgi (I do not
remember his surname), a <EM>Vperyod</EM>-ist and Vera
Vasilyeva, a woman worker. They were an advanced intelligent
group of people. The first evening they arrived Ilyich invited
them to supper in a cafe, and I remember how earnestly he talked
to them all the evening, asking them about St. Petersburg and
their work, fishing eagerly for details and symptoms of the
upswing of the workers' movement in Russia. Nikolai Semashko fixed
them up for the time being in Fontenay-aux-Roses, a suburb of
Paris not far from where he lived, and they spent their
time reading up while waiting for the others to arrive. Then came
two Muscovites, one a tanner named Prisyagin, the other a mill
worker whose name I forget. The St. Petersburg comrades soon made
friends with Prisyagin. He was no ordinary worker, and had edited
the illegal paper of the leather workers <EM>Posadchik.</EM> He
wrote well, but was terribly shy. He got so nervous when he spoke
that his hands would tremble. Belostotsky chaffed him.</P>
<p>
During the Civil War in Russia, Prisyagin was shot by
Kolchak. He was then chairman of the Gubernia Trade-Union Council
in Barnaul.</P>
<p>
Belostotsky poked fun at the Moscow mill worker, too, but in
anything but a kindly way. The man was intellectually undeveloped
and self-opinionated. He wrote poetry and expressed himself in a
high-flown style. I remember once visiting the students in their
rooms, and this Muscovite met me, and called the students
together, saying: "Mister Krupskaya has come." This "Mister
Krupskaya" made him the butt of Belostotsky's merciless
jests. They were constantly at loggerheads. The end of it was that
the St. Petersburgers insisted on his removal from the
school. "The fellow does not know a thing, and the nonsense he
talks about prostitution!" they said. We tried to argue that the
lad would learn better in time, but the St. Petersburgers insisted
on his being sent back to Russia. We fixed him up temporarily with
a job in Germany.</P>
<p>
It was decided to organize the school in the village of
Longjumeau, fifteen kilometres from Paris, a locality in which
there were no Russians or summer residents. Longjumeau was a
straggling French village stretching along the highroad along
which carts with farmers' produce for le ventre de Paris rolled
endlessly all through the night. There was a small tannery there,
and all around lay fields and orchards. The arrangements were
these: the students rented rooms in the village, while Inessa
Armand rented a house, in which a canteen for the students was organized. We and the Zinovievs moved to Longjumeau too. All the housekeeping was done by Katya Mazanova, the wife of a worker who had been in Siberian exile together with Martov (in Turukhansk) and later had worked illegally in the Urals. Katya was a good housekeeper and a good comrade. Things went swimmingly. Some of the students lodged in Inessa's house. These were Serge (Orjonikidze), Semyon (Schwartz) and Zakhar (Breslav). Serge had only recently arrived in Paris. Until then he had lived for a time in Persia, and I remember the long correspondence we had had with him in clarifying the line which Ilyich had taken in regard to the Plekhanovites, the Liquidators and the <EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists. We had always conducted a lively correspondence with the group of Caucasian Bolsheviks. For a long time we had received no reply to our letter concerning the struggle that was going on abroad, and one day the concierge came in and said: "There's a man downstairs who doesn't speak a word of French. I suppose he's come to see you." I went down and saw a Caucasian-looking man standing there and smiling. He was Sergo. From that time on he became one of our most intimate comrades. Semyon Schwartz we had known for a long time. He was a particular favourite of my mother's, in whose presence he had once related how, at the age of nineteen, he had first distributed leaflets in a factory by pretending to be drunk. He was a worker from Nikolayev. We had known Breslav too since 1905 in St. Petersburg, where he had worked in the Moskovsky District.</P>
<p>
Inessa's house was thus occupied entirely by our own crowd. We lived at the other end of the village and took our meals in the common dining room, where it was pleasant to chat with the students, ask them about all kinds of things, and discuss current topics with them.</P>
<p>
We took two rooms in a small two-storey brick house (all the
houses in Longjumeau were brick-built) tenanted by a tannery worker,
and were able to observe at firsthand the life of a small-factory
employee. We went to work early in the morning and came home in the
evening dog tired. The house did not have a bit of garden round
it. Sometimes a table and chair would be carried outside, and he
would sit there for hours, resting his tired head on his toil-worn
arms. None of his work-mates ever dropped in. On Sundays he went to
the church, which towered across the road. Music had him
spellbound. Nuns with lovely operatic voices came to the church to
sing. They sang Beethoven, etc., and it was no wonder that it
captivated this tanner, whose life was so drab and hard. One could
not help comparing him with Prisyagin, who was also a tanner by
trade. Prisyagin's life was no easier, but he was an intelligent
fighter for the cause, a general favourite among his comrades. The
French tanner's wife put on her clogs every morning, took a broom,
and went to work in the neighbouring chateau where she was employed
as a charwoman. The house was left on the hands of her daughter, no
more than a child, who was busy all day in the damp gloomy kitchen
and looked after her younger brothers and sisters. No play-mates
came to see her either, and her life, too, was just a round of
drudgery on weekdays and visits to the church on Sundays. It never
entered anyone's mind in the home of the tanner that it would be a
good thing to change the existing social system. "Was it not God who
created the rich and the poor &#8211; and everything was as it should be,"
the tanner argued.</P>
<p>
The French nurse whom the Zinovievs employed for their
three-year-old son held similar views, and when her charge tried
to get into the chateau park adjoining the village, she told him:
"This is not for us, it is for the masters." We were highly amused
when the child repeated his nurse's phrase to us with an air of
wisdom.</P>
<P>
At last all the students were assembled: Andreyev, a
Nikolayev worker, who while in exile (in Vologda, I believe) had
taken a peculiar course of training (Ilyich jestingly called him
the best pupil), Dogadov from Baku (Pavel) and Sema (Semkov);
two came from Kiev-Andrei Malinovsky and Chugurin, the latter a
Plekhanovite. Andrei Malinovsky afterwards turned out to be an
agent provocateur. He was not distinguished in any way except
that he had a fine voice. He was quite a young man and not very
observant. He told me how he had eluded the police spies on his
way to Paris, and although his story did not sound very
plausible to me at the time, it did not arouse any suspicions in
my mind. The other man, Chugurin, considered himself a
Plekhanovite. He was a Sormovo worker, who had spent a long time
in prison. He was very intelligent, but highly strung. Before
long he became a Bolshevik. Another Plekhanovite was Savva
(Zevin) who came from Ekaterinoslav. When renting rooms for the
students we said that they were Russian country teachers. Savva
contracted typhus during his stay in Longjumeau, and the French
doctor who attended him afterwards remarked with a smile: "What
odd teachers you have." What surprised the French most of all
was the fact that our "teachers" went about barefooted (the
heat that summer was terrific).</P>
<p>
Six months later Zevin took part in the Prague Party
Conference and fought for a long time in the ranks of the
Bolsheviks until he was killed by the White Guards. He was one of
the twenty-six Baku commissars.</P>
<p>
Vasily (S. Iskryanistov) arrived from Ivanovo-Voznesensk. He
studied well, but behaved rather strangely. He shunned everybody
and locked himself up in his room. When he went back to Russia he
flatly refused to deliver any messages. He was an able Party
worker, and for some years occupied executive posts. He was
refused employment at the factories because he was considered
"unreliable," and he could not find a job anywhere. He, his wife,
and their two children lived for a long time on the meagre
earnings of his wife, who was a mill hand. As we learned
afterwards, Iskryanistov was unable to keep it up and became an
agent provocateur. He began to drink heavily. In Longjumeau he did
not drink, but when he returned to Russia he committed suicide. He
drove his wife and children out of the house one evening, heated
up the stove, and shut the flue. In the morning he was found
dead. He received a miserable pay for his "job" &#8211; about ten
rubles. He was a provocateur for less than a year.</P>
<p>
The Poles were represented by Oleg (Pr&oacute;chniak). Half
way through the term Mantsev arrived.</P>
<p>
The lessons were held with strict regularity. Vladimir Ilyich
read lectures on political economy (thirty lectures), on the
agrarian question (ten lectures) and on the theory and practice of
socialism (five lectures). The seminars on political economy were
conducted by Inessa. Zinoviev and Kamenev lectured on the history
of the Party, and Semashko delivered a couple of lectures
too. Other lecturers were Ryazanov, who lectured on the history of
the West-European labour movement, Charles Rappoport, who lectured
on the French movement, Steklov and Finn-Yenotayevsky, who
lectured on public law and finance, Lunacharsky &#8211; on literature,
and Stanislaw Wolski on newspaper printing.</P>
<P>
The students studied hard and diligently. In the evenings they
sometimes went out into the fields, where they would sing a lot
of songs, or lie about under the haystacks, talking about this
and that. Ilyich sometimes
joined them.</P>
<p>
Kamenev did not live in Longjumeau, and he only came there to
deliver his lectures. He was writing his book <EM>Two Parties</EM>
at the time. He discussed it with Ilyich. I remember them lying in
the grass in a ravine outside the village, while Ilyich expounded
his view to Kamenev. He wrote a preface to the book.</P>
<P>I often went to Paris, where I saw our comrades or,
business. This was necessary in order to keep them from coming to
Longjumeau. All the students intended going back to Russia to work
as soon as the course was over, and their stay in Paris had to be
kept as secret as possible. Ilyich was very pleased with the work
of the school. In our spare time we went out cycling together as
usual, going up the hill and riding out fifteen kilometres to a
place where there was an aerodrome. Being further inland, this was
much less frequented than the aerodrome at Juvisy. We were often
the only spectators, and Ilyich was able to watch the evolutions
of the aeroplanes to his heart's content.</P>
<P>In the middle of August we moved back to Paris.</P>
<p>
The unity of all the groups, achieved with such difficulty in
January 1910, swiftly began to break up. As the practical problems
of the work in Russia began to crop up it became ever more clear
that cooperation was impossible. The exigencies of practical work
tore away the mask of Party principle that some of the Mensheviks
wore. The meaning of Trotsky's "loyalty" &#8211; under the mask of
loyalty he had been trying to unite the Liquidators and
<EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists &#8211; stood forth in its true colours. As soon as
the necessity of better organization for work in Russia made
itself felt the artificiality of this unity became at once
apparent. Lenin, Zinoviev and Kamenev, already at the end of
December 1910, had submitted a proposal to the B.C.C.A. urging
that a plenary meeting of the Central Committee should be convened
abroad. The reply to this proposal did not come until a month
later. The Menshevik B.C.C.A. rejected it. Negotiations on the
subject dragged on until the end of May 1911. It was clear that
all talk with the B.C.C.A. was a waste of time. The Bolshevik
representative on the Bureau, Semashko, resigned, and the
Bolsheviks began to convene a conference of members of the Central
Committee who were abroad at the time. There were nine such
members in June 1911. The Bundist Ionov being ill, the others
assembled on June 10, but the Menshevik Gorev and the Bundist
Liber walked out. The rest discussed the most pressing problems,
debated the question of convening a Party conference, and decided
to set up in Russia an Organizing Committee for convening the
Party conference. In August several comrades left for
Russia &#8211; Breslav (Zakhar) went to St. Petersburg and Moscow, Semyon
Schwartz to the Urals and Ekaterinoslav, and Serge Orjonikidze to
the south. Rykov went to Russia too, but was arrested in the
street as soon as he arrived. The newspapers reported that many
addresses had been found on him. That was not true. A number of
Bolsheviks had been arrested at the same time as Rykov, but
afterwards we learned that in Leipzig, where Pyatnitsky was then
working on the shipping of literature to Russia and where Rykov
had called on his way to Russia, there lived a man named
Brendinsky, our shipping agent, who turned out to be an agent
provocateur. He coded the addresses for Rykov. Therefore, although
the police found nothing on Rykov when they arrested him, all the
addresses became unusable.</P>
<p>
A conference was called in Baku. Its members escaped arrest
by a mere accident, as one of its most prominent members &#8211; Stepan
Shaumyan, and a number of other Baku Party workers had been
arrested. The conference was transferred to Tiflis and held
there. Representatives of five organizations were
present. Schwartz, Sergo and others were there. Bolsheviks and
Plekhanovites were represented. Chernomazov was there too &#8211; he
proved later to be an agent provocateur. The Russian Organizing
Committee, however, had done its work &#8211; a Party conference
was convened in January 1912.</P>
<P>The Bolshevik group in Paris in 1911 was a fairly strong
organization. Among its members were Semashko, Vladimirsky,
Antonov (Britman), Kuznetsov (Sapozhkov), the Belenkys (Abram,
and later his brother Grisha), Inessa Armand, Stael, Natasha
Gopner, Kotlyarenko, Chernov (whose real name I do not remember),
Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Lilina, Taratuta, Mark (Lyubimov) and
Lyova (Vladimirov). There were over forty people all told. On the
whole this group had fairly large contacts with Russia and
considerable revolutionary experience. The struggle with the
Liquidators, Trotskyites and others had steeled it. The group had
done a great deal towards helping the work in Russia and carried
on a certain amount of work among the French workers and the
Russian emigrant public at large. This public in Paris was fairly
numerous. At one time Sta&euml;l and I had tried to do some work
among the mass of emigrant women, such as milliners, dressmakers,
etc. We organized a number of meetings, but underestimation of
this work was a hindrance. At every meeting someone was bound
to kick up a row, and raise the question: "What's the idea of a
women's meeting, anyway?" And so the thing petered out, although
it might have done some good. Ilyich thought it a useful job.</P>
<p>
At the end of September Vladimir Ilyich went to Zurich to
attend a meeting of the International Socialist
Bureau. Molkenburg's letter to the Central Committee of the German
Social-Democratic Party was discussed. The letter urged that
criticism of the colonial policy in connection with the Morocco
incidents should not be stressed too hard owing to the
forthcoming elections. Rosa Luxemburg had published that
letter. Bebel resented it. Vladimir Ilyich defended Rosa. The
opportunist policy of the German Social-Democrats was strikingly
revealed already at this meeting.</P>
<p>
On this trip Ilyich read a number of papers in Switzerland.</P>
<p>
In October the Lafargues committed suicide. Their death was a
great shock to Ilyich. We recalled our visit to them. Ilyich said:
"If you can't do any more work for the Party you must be able to
face the truth and die like the Lafargues." And he wanted to say
over their graves that their work had not been in vain, that the
cause which they had launched, the cause of Marx, with whom both
Paul and Laura Lafargue had been so closely associated,
was growing and spreading to distant Asia. At that time the tide of the mass revolutionary movement was rising in China. Vladimir Ilyich wrote the speech and Inessa translated it. I remember with what deep emotion he delivered it at the funeral on behalf of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.</P>
<p>
On the eve of the New Year the Bolsheviks called a conference
of the Bolshevik groups abroad. The temper of the conference was a
cheerful one, although life in foreign exile had frayed people's
nerves pretty badly.</P>
