Last Months In Emigration</h1>
<H4>The February Revolution</H4>
<H4>Departure for Russia</H4>
<hr class="end">
<BR>
<p>
One day, after lunch, when Ilyich was about to go to the
library and I had finished clearing away the dishes, Bronski came
in, saying: "Haven't you heard the news? There's a revolution in
Russia!" And he told us about the latest reports published in the
special editions of the newspapers. After Bronski had gone, we
went down to the lake, on the shore of which all the newspapers
were posted up as soon as they came out.</P>
<p>
We read the reports several times. A revolution had really
taken place in Russia. Ilyich's mind went to work at once. I
hardly remember how the rest of the day and the night passed. Next
day the second batch of official reports about the February
Revolution found Ilyich writing to Kollontai in Stockholm:
<EM>"Never again</EM> along the lines of the Second International!
<EM>Never again</EM> with Kautsky! By all means <EM>a more
revolutionary</EM> programme and tactics." And further on:
"... <EM>as before,</EM> revolutionary propaganda, agitation and
struggle with the aim of an <EM>international</EM> proletarian
revolution and for the conquest of power by the 'Soviets of
Workers' Deputies (but not by the Cadet fakers)."</P> 
<p>
Ilyich straightaway took a clear uncompromising line, although
he had not yet grasped the scope of the revolution. He still
gauged it by the scope of the 1905 Revolution, and said that the
most important task of the moment was to combine legal work with
illegal.</P>
<p>
The next day, in reply to Kollontai's telegram asking for
instructions, he wrote in a different vein, more concretely. He no
longer spoke about the conquest of power by the Soviets of
Workers' Deputies prospectively, but spoke about concrete
preparations for seizing power and arming the workers, about the
fight for bread, peace and freedom. "Spread out! Rouse new
sections! Awaken fresh initiative, form new organizations in every
stratum and prove to them that peace can come only with the armed
Soviet of Workers' Deputies in power." Together with Zinoviev,
Ilyich set to work drawing up a resolution on the February
Revolution.</P>
<p>
The moment the news of the February Revolution was received,
Ilyich was all eagerness to go back to Russia.</P>
<p>
England and France would never have allowed any Bolsheviks to
go through to Russia. That much was clear to Ilyich, who wrote to
Kollontai: "We are afraid we shall not be able to leave this
accursed Switzerland very soon." With this in mind, he discussed
with Kollontai in his letters of March 16 and 17 how best to
organize contact with St. Petersburg.</P>
<p>
As there were no legal ways of travelling, illegal ways would
have to be used. But what ways? From the moment the news of the
revolution was received, Ilyich had no sleep. His nights were
spent building the most improbable plans. We could fly over by
plane. But such an idea could only be thought of in a waking
dream. Put into words, its unreality became at once obvious. The
thing was to obtain the passport of some foreigner from a neutral
country, best of all a Swede, who was less likely to arouse
suspicion. A Swedish passport could be obtained through the
Swedish comrades, but ignorance of the language was an obstacle to
using it. Perhaps just a little Swedish would do? You might easily
give yourself away, though. "Imagine yourself falling asleep and
dreaming of Mensheviks, which will start you off swearing juicily
in Russian! Where will your disguise be then?" I said with a
laugh.</P>
<p>
Nevertheless Ilyich wrote to Ganiecki enquiring whether there
was any way of getting into the country through Germany.</P>
<p>
On March 18, the anniversary of the Paris Commune, Ilyich went
to Chaux-de-Fonds, a large Swiss labour centre. He went there
gladly. Abramovich, a young comrade, worked at a factory there and
took an active part in the Swiss labour movement. The thought of
the Paris Commune, of utilizing its experience in the newly
launched Russian revolutionary movement, and of avoiding its
errors occupied Ilyich's mind a good deal those days, and so his
lecture went off very well and he was pleased with it himself. His
address impressed our comrades tremendously, but the Swiss thought
it impracticable &#8211; even the Swiss working-class centres had but a
vague idea of what was going on in Russia.</P>
<p>
The Russian emigrant groups of internationalists living in
Switzerland met on March 19 to discuss ways of getting back to
Russia. Martov proposed a plan for allowing emigrants to pass
through Germany in exchange for German and Austrian prisoners of
war interned in Russia. However, no one was inclined to accept
this plan. Lenin was the only one who jumped at it. We would have
to go about it carefully, he said. The best thing would be to have
the negotiations started at the initiative of the Swiss
Government. Grimm was authorized to enter into negotiations with
the Swiss authorities. Nothing came of it, however. No replies
were received to the telegrams sent to Russia. Ilyich fretted.
"What torture it is for us all to sit here at such a
time!" he wrote to Ganiecki in Stockholm. But he had already
taken a grip upon himself.</P>
<p>
<EM>Pravda</EM> started coming out in St. Petersburg on March
18, and on the 20th Ilyich started to send in his "Letters from
Afar." They were five in number ("The First Stage of the First
Revolution," "The New Government and the Proletariat," "Concerning
a Proletarian Militia," "How To Achieve Peace," and "The Tasks
Connected with the Building of Revolutionary Proletarian State
System"). Only the first letter was published on the day Lenin
arrived in St. Petersburg, three others were lying in the editors'
office and the fifth had not even been sent to <EM>Pravda,</EM> as
Lenin had started writing it just before leaving for Russia.</P>
<p>
These letters strikingly reflect Ilyich's train of thoughts
on the eve of his departure. I particularly remember what he then
said about the militia. This question is dealt with in the third
of the series &#8211; "Concerning a Proletarian Militia." It was not
published until 1924, after the death of Ilyich. In it Ilyich
expounds his ideas on the nature of the proletarian state. To
obtain a really proper understanding of Lenin's book <EM>The
State and Revolution,</EM> one must read these "Letters from
Afar." The whole subject is treated in this article with
extraordinary concreteness. Ilyich spoke about a new type of
militia, consisting entirely of armed citizens, of adult citizens
of both sexes. Besides its direct military duties, this militia
was to effect prompt and proper appropriation and distribution of
grain and other food surpluses, act as sanitary inspectors, see to
it that every family had bread, every child a bottle of good milk,
and that not a single grown-up in a rich family should dare to
have any extra milk until the children had been provided for, that
the palaces and rich homes should not stand empty, but be used as
shelter for the homeless and destitute. "Who can carry out these
measures except a people's militia, to which women should without
fail belong equally with men?" Ilyich wrote.</P>
<p>
"These measures <EM>do not yet</EM> constitute socialism. They
pertain to the distribution of articles of consumption, and not to
the reorganization of production.... How to classify them
theoretically is not the point now. We would be committing a great
mistake if we attempted to force the complex, urgent, rapidly
developing practical tasks of the revolution into the Procrustean
bed of narrowly conceived 'theory' instead of regarding theory
primarily and mostly as a <EM>guide to action."</EM> The
proletarian militia would <EM>actually educate the masses </EM>to
take part <EM>in all</EM> state affairs. "Such a militia would
draw the young people into political life and teach them not only
by word of mouth, but also by action, by <EM>work."</EM> "On the
order of the day is the task of <EM>organization,</EM> but
certainly not in the stereotyped sense of working only on
stereotyped organizations, but in the sense of drawing
unprecedentedly broad masses of the oppressed classes into an
organization and of making this organization itself take over
military, state and national-economic functions."</P>
<p>
Rereading this letter of Ilyich's today, after so many years,
I can see him before me, as large as life: on the one hand, his
extraordinary sober-mindedness, his clear appreciation of the
necessity of an irreconcilable armed struggle and of the fact that
no concessions or vacillation could be tolerated at that moment;
on the other hand, his unremitting attention to the mass movement,
to the organization of the broad masses in a new way, to their
concrete needs, and to the immediate improvement of their
conditions. Ilyich spoke about all these matters a great deal in
the winter of 1916-1917, and especially in the period immediately
preceding the February Revolution.</P>
<p>
The negotiations dragged on. The Provisional Government
obviously did not want to allow the internationalists entry into
Russia, and the news from Russia pointed to certain vacillation
among the comrades there. All this necessitated our speedy
departure. Ilyich sent a telegram to Ganiecki, which the latter
did not receive until March 25, saying: "Cannot understand
delay. Mensheviks demand sanction of Soviet of Workers'
Deputies. Send someone immediately Finland or Petrograd make
possible arrangements with Chkheidze. Opinion Belenin
desirable." By Belenin was meant the Bureau of the Central
Committee. Kollontai arrived in Russia on March 18 and explained
how matters stood with Ilyich's arrival. Letters were received
from Ganiecki. The Bureau of the Central Committee issued
instructions through him that "Ulyanov must come immediately."
Ganiecki re-telegraphed this message to Lenin. Vladimir Ilyich
insisted that negotiations be opened through Fritz Platten,
the Swiss Socialist-Internationalist. Platten came to a definite
written understanding with the German Ambassador in
Switzerland. The principal points of this agreement were: 1. That
all emigrants were to be allowed to go regardless of their views
on the war, 2. That no one could enter the railway car in which
the emigrants were travelling without the permission of
Platten. There was to be no inspection of passports or luggage;
3. That the passengers undertook to agitate in Russia for a
corresponding number of Austro-German internees to be repatriated
by way of exchange. Ilyich got busy making preparations for
departure, and wrote to various comrades in Berne and Geneva,
etc. The <EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists Ilyich was negotiating with refused
to go. Karl and Kasparov, two close comrades who were dying in
Davos, had to be left behind. Ilyich wrote them a farewell
greeting. Or rather he added a postscript to my long letter. I
wrote in detail about who was going, what preparations we were
making and what our plans were. The few words that Ilyich added
showed how well he understood the feelings of those who were
staying behind.</P>
<p>
"Dear Kasparov," he wrote, "I send you and Karl my heartiest
greetings and wish you good cheer. You must have patience. I
hope we shall meet soon in St. Petersburg. My best wishes to you
both. Yours, Lenin." </P>
<p>
"I wish you good cheer. You must have patience...." Aye, that
was just the thing. We never met again. Both Kasparov and Karl
died soon after.</P>
<p>
Ilyich wrote an article "The Tasks of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party in the Russian Revolution" for the
Zurich paper <EM>Volksrecht,</EM> and a "Farewell Letter to the
Swiss Workers" which ended with the words: "Long live the
proletarian revolution that is beginning in Europe!" He also
wrote a letter "To Comrades Languishing in Captivity" in which he
told them about the revolution that had started and the coming
struggle. We had to write to them. While living in Berne we had
started a fairly wide correspondence with Russian prisoners of war
in German camps. We could not do much for them in the way of
financial assistance, of course, but we did what we could, wrote
letters to them and sent them literature. A number of close
contacts were made. After our departure from Berne this work was
continued by the Safarovs. We sent illegal literature to these
prisoners of war, including Kollontai's pamphlet on the war, which
was a great success, a number of leaflets, etc.</P>
<p>
A few months before we left Zurich two prisoners of war turned
up &#8211; one of them a Voronezh peasant named Mikhalyov, the other an
Odessa worker. They had escaped from a German prisoner-of-war camp
by swimming across Bodensee. They came to our Zurich group. Ilyich
had long talks with them. Mikhalyov's stories about life among
the prisoners of war were of great interest. He told us how the
Ukrainian prisoners had first been sent to Galicia, how
pro-Ukrainian agitation against Russia had been conducted among
them, and how afterwards he and others had been transferred to
Germany where they had been made to work for well-to-do
farmers. "What wonderful management, not a crust of bread goes
waste with them," Mikhalyov exclaimed. "When I get back to my
home village I'll run the farm the same way as they do." He came
of a family of Old Believers, and his grandfather and grandmother
would not allow him to learn to read and write &#8211; literacy was
supposed to be the mark of the devil. Nevertheless, during his
captivity, he had learned to read and write. His grandparents sent
him millet and pork fat, and the Germans looked on with
astonishment as he cooked and ate millet porridge. Mikhalyov had
counted on going to a people's university in Zurich, and was
shocked to hear that there was none. He was interned. He got
some work to do as a navvy and could not stop wondering at
the downtrodden state of the Swiss working man. "Going to the
office to draw my pay," he said, "I see the Swiss workers standing
there and not daring to go into the office &#8211; they stood hugging the
wall and peeping in through the window. What a downtrodden people!
I went straight up, opened the door, walked in and got my money
for my work!" Ilyich was greatly intrigued by this Voronezh
peasant, who had only just learned to read and write and yet
talked about the abject condition of the Swiss workers. Mikhalyov
also described how a Russian priest once visited the prisoners
camp, but the soldiers began to shout and swear and refused to
listen to him. One of the prisoners went up to him and kissed his
hand, saying: "You'd better go away, Father, this is no place for
you." Mikhalyov and his comrades asked us to take them with us to
Russia, but we did not know how we would fare ourselves &#8211; we might
all be arrested for all we knew. After our departure Mikhalyov
crossed over to France, first living in Paris, then working at
some tractor plant and later at some job in Eastern France, where
there were a lot of Polish emigrants. In 1918 (or 1919 &#8211; I do not
remember which) Mikhalyov returned to Russia. Ilyich met
him. Mikhalyov related how in Paris he and several other prisoners
of war who had escaped from Germany were sent for by the Russian
Embassy and asked to sign an appeal urging that the war be
continued to a victorious end. And although important bemedalled
officials spoke to them, the soldiers refused to sign it. "I got
up and said the war should be stopped, and went away. The others
slipped out on the quiet too," he said. He described the big
anti-war campaign which the young people started in the little
French town where he lived. Mikhalyov himself no longer resembled
the Voronezh peasant we had first met. He wore a French cap, and
khaki puttees, and his face was clean shaven. Ilyich fixed him up
with some job in a factory, but all his thoughts were for
his native village. The place had passed from hand to hand, from
the Reds to the Whites and back again. The central part of the
village had been burned down by the Whites, but his house was
intact, and his grandparents were still alive. I learned all this
from Mikhalyov himself, who came to see me at the Central
Political Education Department. He told me that he was going home
soon. "Why don't you go now?" I asked him. "I'm waiting for my
beard to grow. If Grandma and Grandpa see me without it they'll
die of grief!" This year I received a letter from Mikhalyov. He is
working on the railway in Central Asia, and writes that on Lenin
Memorial Day he spoke at a workers' club about how he had met
Ilyich in 1917 in Zurich and about our life abroad. Everyone had
listened with interest, but had doubted the truth of the story,
and so Mikhalyov asked me to confirm that he had really met Ilyich
in Zurich.</P>
<p>
Mikhalyov was a piece of real life. So also were the letters
which our prisoners of war sent to our P.O.W. Relief
Committee. </P>
<P>
Ilyich could not leave for Russia without writing to them of
what was uppermost in his mind at the moment.</P>
<p>
When we received the letter from Berne telling us that
Platten's negotiations had been successfully concluded, and that
as soon as the protocol was signed we could start for Russia,
Ilyich sprang to his feet: "Let us catch the first train." The
train was due to leave in two hours. In those two hours we had to
wind up our "household," settle with the landlady, return the
books to the library, pack up and so on. "Go by yourself, I'll
leave tomorrow," I said. But Ilyich insisted on us going
together. In two hours everything was done &#8211; the books packed,
letters destroyed, the necessary clothes and articles selected,
and all affairs settled. We caught the first train to Berne.</P>
<p>
All the comrades who were going to Russia gathered at the
People's House in Berne. Among the passengers were the Zinovievs,
the Usieviches, Inessa Armand, the Safarovs, Olga Ravich,
Abramovich from Chaux-de-Fonds, Grebelskaya, Kharitonov, Linda
Rosenblum, Boitsov, Mikha Tskhakaya, the Marienhoffs and
Sokolnikov. Radek went under the guise of a Russian. Altogether
thirty people were going, not counting curly-headed little Robert,
the four-yeard-old son of a Bundist woman. </P>
<P>We were escorted by Fritz Platten.</P>
<p>
The defencists raised a terrible hullabaloo about the
Bolsheviks travelling through Germany. Naturally, the German
Government gave permission for us to travel through Germany in the
belief that revolution was a disaster to a country, and that by
allowing emigrant internationalists to return to their country
they were helping to spread the revolution to Russia. The
Bolsheviks, for their part, considered it their duty to develop
revolutionary agitation in Russia, and made it their aim to bring
about a victorious proletarian revolution. They did not care what
the german bourgeois government thought about it. They knew that
the defencists would start a mud-slinging campaign against them,
but that the masses in the long run would follow their lead. At
that time, on march 27, the Bolsheviks were the only ones to take
the risk of going that way. A month later, over two hundred
emigrants, including Martov and other Mensheviks, followed the
same route through Germany.</P>
<p>
When boarding the train, no one examined either our luggage or
our passports. Ilyich withdrew completely into himself, and his
thoughts ran forward into Russia. The talk during the journey was
mostly of a trivial nature. Robert's chirpy voice rang through the
car. He took a great liking to Sokolnikov, and would have no truck
with the women. The Germans went out of their way to show that
they had plenty of everything, and the cook served up good square
meals, to which our emigrant fraternity was hardly
accustomed. Looking out of the carriage window, we were struck by
the total absence of grown-up men. Only women, teenagers and
children could be seen at the wayside stations, on the fields, and
in the streets of the towns. This impression often came back to me
during the early days of our arrival in Petrograd, where the
tramcars were packed with soldiers.</P>
<p>
In Berlin our train was shunted to a siding. Just before we
came to Berlin, several German Social-Democrats had got in in a
special compartment. None of us spoke to them except Robert, who
looked into their compartment and began interrogating them in
French: "What does the conductor do?" I don't know what the
Germans told Robert, but I do know that they had no chance to put
any questions of their own to the Bolsheviks. On March 31 we
arrived in Sweden. At Stockholm we were met by the Swedish
Social-Democratic M.P.'s Lindhagen, Karlsson, Strom, T. Nerman and
others. A red flag had been hung up in the waiting room and a
meeting was held there. I have only a dim recollection of
Stockholm, as all my thoughts were in Russia. The Provisional
Government of Russia did not allow Fritz Platten and Radek into
the country. It did not dare to stop the Bolsheviks, however. We
crossed into Finland from Sweden in Finnish country
sleighs. Everything was dear and familiar &#8211; the rickety old
third-class carriages, the Russian soldiers. It made you feel
good. It was not long before Robert woke up in the arms of an
elderly soldier, and clasped him round the neck, chattering away
to him in French and eating the sweet Easter cream-cheese with
which the soldier was feeding him. We all huddled round the
windows. The station platforms we passed were crowded with
soldiers. Usievich leaned out and shouted: "Long live the world
revolution!" The soldiers stared at him. A pale-faced lieutenant
passed us several times, and when Ilyich and I went into the next
car, which was empty, he sat down beside Ilyich and engaged him in
conversation. The lieutenant was a defencist. They began a
spirited argument. Ilyich, too, was very pale. Little by little
the car filled with soldiers until it was packed tight. They stood
up on the seats the better to be able to see and hear the man who
was speaking in such understandable terms against the predatory
war. Their faces grew tense as they listened with growing
interest.</P>
<p>
At Beloostrov we were met by Maria Ilyinichna, Shlyapnikov,
Stael and other comrades. There were women workers there
too. Stael kept urging me to say a few words of greeting to them,
but words utterly failed me. The comrades got in with us. Ilyich
asked whether we would be arrested on our arrival. The comrades
smiled. Soon we arrived in Petrograd.</P>
