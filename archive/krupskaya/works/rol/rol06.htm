The Second Congress</h1>
<H4>July-August 1903</H4>
<hr class="end">

<p>
It was originally intended to hold the congress in
Brussels, and in fact the first sittings were held there. Koltsov,
an old Plekhanovite, lived in Brussels at the time, and he
undertook to see to all the arrangements. As it turned out,
however, it was not so easy to arrange the congress there. All the
delegates were to have reported to Koltsov, but after four or five
Russians had called on him his landlady told him that she would
not stand any more of this coming and going, and if one more
person called he would have to move out at once. Koltsov's wife
after that stood on the street corner all day long, intercepting
the delegates and directing them to the socialist hotel Cog d'Or
as I believe it was called.</P>
<p>
The delegates overran the whole hotel, and Gusev, after a drop
of brandy, sang operatic arias in the evening in such a powerful
voice that crowds collected at the windows outside. (Vladimir
Ilyich liked Gusev's singing, especially the song <EM>We Were
Wedded Out of Church</EM>.) </P>
<P>We overdid the secrecy precautions, though. The Belgian Party
thought it would be safer to hold the congress in a vast flour
warehouse. Our intrusion there only succeeded in astonishing the
rats and the policemen. The word went round that Russian
revolutionaries had got together to plot in secret.</P>
<p>
The congress was attended by forty-three delegates with a
deciding vote and fourteen with a deliberative vote. In comparison
with present-day congresses, where the numerous delegates
represent hundreds of thousands of Party members, this congress
would seem a small one, but at that time we thought it big.
The First Congress held in 1898 was attended by only nine
persons. Everyone felt that considerable progress had been made
in those five years. Most important of all, the organizations
these delegates came from were no longer semi-mythical, they
definitely existed and were already in touch with the
working-class movement, which was beginning to spread ever
wider.</P>
<p>
How Vladimir Ilyich had dreamt of such a congress! He always,
as long as he lived, attached tremendous importance to Party
congresses. He held the Party congress to be the highest
authority, where all things personal had to be cast aside, where
nothing was to be concealed, and everything was to be open and
above board. He always took great pains in preparing for Party
congresses, and was particularly careful in thinking out his
speeches.</P>
<p>
Plekhanov looked forward to the congress just as eagerly as
Vladimir Ilyich. He opened it. The big window of the flour
warehouse near the improvised platform was covered with some red
cloth. Everyone was excited. Plekhanov's speech, uttered with
genuine deep feeling, sounded very Solemn. And no wonder! The
long years of emigrant life seemed to be a thing of the past. He
was opening the Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour Party.</P>
<p>
Strictly speaking, the Second Congress was an inaugural
congress. Fundamental questions of theory were raised there, and
the foundations of Party ideology were laid. At the First Congress
only the Party's designation and a manifesto on its formation had
been adopted. Up to the time of the Second Congress the Party had
had no programme. The editorial board of <EM>Iskra </EM>had
drafted such a programme, and it had been under discussion for a
long time. Every word, every sentence had been motivated, and
weighed, and hotly debated. Correspondence on the programme had
been carried on for months between the Munich and Swiss sections
of the editorial board. Many practical workers regarded these
disputes to be of a purely abstract nature, and did not think it
mattered whether a "more-or-less" proviso was left standing in the
programme or not.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich and I were once reminded of a simile used by
Lev Tolstoi. He was going along and saw from afar a man squatting
and waving his arms about in a ridiculous way; a madman, he
thought, but when he drew nearer, he saw it to be a man sharpening
a knife on the kerb. The same thing happens in theoretical
disputes. From the outside it seems a sheer waste of time, but
when you go into the matter more deeply you see that it is a
momentous issue. It was like that with the programme.</P>
<p>
When the delegates began to arrive in Geneva the chief
question discussed with them in greatest detail was that of the
programme. That question went through at the congress more
smoothly than any other.</P>
<p>
Another question of tremendous importance discussed at the
Second Congress was that of the Bund. It had been resolved at the
First Congress that the Bund constituted a section of the Party,
albeit an autonomous one. During the five years that had elapsed
since the First Congress the Party, practically speaking, had not
existed as a united whole, and the Bund had led a separate
existence. Now the Bund wanted to make good this separateness and
to establish merely federative relations with the R.S.D.L.P. The
motive behind this was that the Bund, reflecting as it did the
mood of the artisans of the small Jewish towns, was much more
interested in the economic than in the political struggle, and
therefore sympathized much more with the "Economists" than with
the <EM>Iskra</EM>-ists. The issue at stake was whether the
country was to have a strong united workers' Party, rallying
solidly around it the workers of all nationalities living on
Russian territory, or whether it was to have several workers'
parties constituted separately according to nationality. It was a
question of achieving international solidarity within the
country. The <EM>Iskra</EM> editorial board stood for
international consolidation of the working class. The Bund stood
for national separatism and merely friendly contractual relations
between the national workers' parties of Russia.</P>
<p>
The question of the Bund had also been discussed in detail
with the delegates as they arrived, and was likewise decided on
<EM>Iskra</EM> lines by an overwhelming majority.</P>
<p>
The vast importance of the fundamental issues dealt with and
decided at the Second Congress was later overshadowed for many by
the split. During the debates on these questions Vladimir Ilyich
felt more than usually I close to Plekhanov. The latter's
speech to the effect that the thesis "the good of the revolution
is the highest law" should be considered the basic democratic
principle, and that even the idea of universal franchise should be
regarded from the point of view of this principle, made a profound
impression on Vladimir Ilyich. He recollected it fourteen years
later, when the Bolsheviks were faced with the question of
dismissing the Constituent Assembly.</P>
<p>
Another speech of Plekhanov's that fell in with Vladimir
Ilyich's ideas was that in which he spoke about the importance of
popular education as being the "guarantee of the rights of the
proletariat." </P>
<P>Plekhanov felt close to Lenin, too, at the congress.</P>
<p>
Replying to Akimov, an ardent supporter of the <EM>Rabocheye
Delo</EM> group, who was all out to create dissension between
Plekhanov and Lenin, Plekhanov said humorously: "Napoleon had a
craze for making his marshals divorce their wives. Some marshals
submitted, although they loved their wives. Comrade Akimov
reminds me of Napoleon in that respect &#8211; he wants to divorce me and
Lenin at all costs. But I shall show more character than
Napoleon's marshals &#8211; I shall not divorce Lenin and I hope he does
not intend to divorce me." Vladimir Ilyich laughed and shook his
head.</P>
<p>
During the discussion of the first item on the agenda (the
constitution of the congress) an unexpected incident occurred over
the question of inviting a representative of the <EM>Borba</EM>
(Struggle) group (Ryazanov, Nevzorov, Gurevich). The O.C. wanted
to come forward with its own opinion. It was not a question of the
<EM>Borba </EM>group at all; the O.C. was trying to impose a
special discipline on its members in face of the congress. The
O.C. wanted to act as a group, which had previously decided among
themselves how they were going to vote, and to speak at the
congress as a group. Thus the supreme authority for a member of
the congress would be the group and not the congress
itself. Vladimir Ilyich was fairly boiling with indignation. He
was not the only one to support Pavlovich (Krasikov), when the
latter protested against these tactics; he was backed by Martov,
too, and others. Although the O.C. was dismissed by the congress,
the incident was significant and augured all kinds of
complications. The incident, however, was temporarily pushed into
the background by such momentous issues as the Bund's place within
the Party and the Party's programme. On the question of the Bund,
the <EM>Iskra</EM> editorial board, the O.C. and the local
delegates were of one mind. Yegorov (Levin), representative of
<EM>Yuzhny Rabochy</EM> and member of the O.C. also came out
emphatically against the Bund. Plekhanov complimented him during
the recess, saying that his speech ought to be "spread wide
through all the communes." The Bund was utterly defeated. The
thesis that national peculiarities must not interfere with the
unity of Party work and the monolithic unity of the
Social-Democratic movement was securely established.</P>
<p>
Meanwhile we were compelled to move to London. The Brussels
police made things difficult for the delegates, and when they
deported Zemlyachka and someone else, we all got moving. In London
the Takhtarevs did all they could to make congress
arrangements.'The London police raised no obstacles.</P>
<p>
The discussion of the Bund question was continued. Then, while
the question of the programme was in its committee stage, we
passed to the fourth item of the agenda &#8211; the question of approving
the central organ. <EM>Iskra</EM> was unanimously recognized as
such, the <EM>Rabocheye Delo</EM> group alone being
against. <EM>Iskra</EM> was hailed with enthusiasm. Even Popov
(Rozanov), the representative of the O.C., said: "Here, at this
congress, we see a united Party, created largely through the
activity of <EM>Iskra.</EM>" That was the tenth sitting. There
were thirty-seven sittings in all. Clouds steadily began to
gather. Three persons had to be elected to the Central
Committee. No nucleus of a C.C. was yet available. One
unquestionable candidature was Glebov (Noskov), who had proved
himself to be an energetic organizer. Another would have been that
of Clair (Krzhizhanovsky), had he been at the congress. But he was
not. The voting for him and Kurz had to be done by proxy, which
was extremely awkward. On the other hand, there were far too many
"generals" at the congress who were candidates for the Central
Committee. These were Jacques (Stein-Alexandrova), Fomin
(Krokhmal), Stern (Kostya &#8211; Rosa Galberstadt), Popov (Rozanov) and
Yegorov (Levin). All these were candidates for two seats
on the C.C. trio. We all knew one another not only as Party workers, but in intimate personal life. It was all a tangle of personal sympathies and antipathies. The atmosphere grew tenser as the time for voting approached Although the accusations of the Bund and <EM>Rabocheye Delo</EM> about the foreign Centre wanting to control and dictate etc., had met with a solid rebuff at the outset, they had done their work by influencing the Centre and the waverers, although they may not have been aware of it. Of whose "control" were people afraid? Not of Martov's Zasulich's, Starover's and Axelrod's, of course. They were afraid of Lenin's and Plekhanov's control. But they knew that the questions of personnel and Russian work would be decided by Lenin, and not by Plekhanov, who took no part in the practical work.</P>
<p>
The congress had endorsed the <EM>Iskra</EM> line, but the
<EM>Iskra</EM> editorial board had still to be elected.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich moved that the editorial board of
<EM>Iskra</EM> should consist of three members. He had told Martov
and Potresov about this proposal beforehand. Speaking with the
delegates on their arrival, Martov had supported the idea of three
editors as being the most expedient. He realized then that the
three-man proposal was aimed chiefly against Plekhanov. When
Vladimir Ilyich handed Plekhanov his draft proposal for an
editorial board of three, Plekhanov had read it and put it in his
pocket without saying a word. He understood what it was about, and
agreed to it. Once there was a Party, practical work was
necessary.</P>
<p>
Martov mixed more with the members of the Organizing Committee
than anyone else on Iskra. It did not take long to persuade him
that the three-man idea was directed against him, and that if he
joined it he would be betraying Zasulich, Potresov and
Axelrod. Axelrod and Zasulich were greatly upset.</P>
<p>
In such an atmosphere, the dispute over the first paragraph
of the Rules assumed an extremely acrimonious character. Lenin and
Martov disagreed both politically and organizationally on the
question of Paragraph I of the party Rules. They had often
disagreed before, but such differences had then been confined to
narrow limits and had soon been sunk. Now they had come out at the
congress, and everyone who had had a grudge against Iskra, against
Plekhanov and Lenin, went out of his way to fan it up into a
disagreement on a fundamental issue. Lenin
was attacked for his article <EM>Where to Begin? </EM>and his pamphlet <EM>What Is To Be Done?</EM> and accused of being ambitious, and so on. In his booklet <EM>One Step Forward, Two Steps Back</EM> he wrote:</P>
<p>
"I cannot help recalling in this connection a conversation I
happened to have at the congress with one of the 'Centre'
delegates.'How oppressive the atmosphere is at our congress!' he
had complained. 'This bitter fighting, this agitation one
against the other, this biting controversy, this uncomradely
attitude...''What a splendid thing our congress is!' I replied.'A
free and open struggle. Opinions have been stated. The shades have
been brought out. The groups have taken shape. Hands have
been raised. A decision has been taken. A stage has been
passed. Forward! That's the stuff for me! That's life! That's not
like the endless, tedious word-chopping of intellectuals which
terminates not because the question has been settled, but because
they are too tired to talk any more.... The comrade of the
'Centre' had looked at me with a puzzled expression and shrugged
his shoulders. We were speaking in different tongues." </P>
<P>Here, in this quotation we have the whole of Ilyich.</P>
<p>
His nerves had been keyed up from the very beginning Of the
congress. The Belgian woman worker with whom we lodged in Brussels
was very upset at Vladimir Ilyich not eating the lovely radishes
and Dutch cheese which she Served up for breakfast every
morning. He was too worried to be able to eat anything. In London
he worried so much that he stopped sleeping altogether.</P>
<p>
Vehement though he was in the debates, Vladimir Ilyich was
absolutely impartial as chairman and neve, treated an opponent
unfairly. Not so Plekhanov. When he was in the chair he liked to
flash his wit and tease his opponent.</P>
<p>
Although there were no differences among the overwhelming
majority of the delegates on the question or the Bund's place in
the Party, on the question of the programme, and the acceptance of
the Iskra line as their banner, a definite rift made itself felt
half-way through the congress, which deepened towards the
end. Strictly , speaking, no serious differences standing in the
way of joint work or making such work impossible had vet come to
light at the congress. They existed in a latent form, however,
potentially, so to speak. Yet the congress was clearly
divided. Many were inclined to blame Plekhanov's tactlessness,
Lenin's "vehemence" and "ambition," Pavlovich's pinpricks, and the
unfair treatment of Zasulich and Axelrod &#8211; and they sided with
those who had a grievance. They missed the substance through
looking at personalities. Trotsky was one of them. He became a
fierce opponent of Lenin. And the substance was this &#8211; that the
comrades grouped around Lenin were far more seriously committed to
principles, which they wanted to see applied at all cost and
pervading all the practical work. The other group had more of the
man-in-the-street mentality, were given to compromise and
concessions in principle, and had more regard for persons.</P>
<p>
The struggle during the elections was very sharp. One or two scenes before the voting started are still fresh in my memory. Axelrod accused Bauman (Sorokin) of all alleged lack of moral sense, and brought up some gossip about an incident supposed to have taken place in Siberian exile. Bauman said nothing, but there were tears in his eyes.</P>
<p>
Another scene. Deutsch was angrily telling off Glebov
(Noskov), who looked up with flashing eyes and said with
annoyance: "I'd keep my mouth shut if I were you, old boy!"</P>
<p>
The congress ended. Glebov, Clair and Kurz were elected to
the Central Committee, twenty out of the forty-four votes being
abstentions. Plekhanov, Lenin and Martov were elected to the
Central Organ. Martov refused to work on the editorial board. The
split was obvious.</P>
