Preface to Part III</h1>

I hesitated long before deciding to write this third
post-October part of my reminiscences. Until our arrival in
Russia in 1917 I had worked side by side with Ilyich. My work
had been a direct aid to his activities, I had watched him day
by day in his talks with people, and known every little detail
of the things that had interested him. In the post-October
period it was different. Under the new Soviet conditions of work
the character of my secretarial activities underwent a change.
Its scope was considerably narrowed. Ilyich persuaded me to take
up work on the educational front. This work engrossed me
completely. Still more gripping, of course, in all its colourful
complexity, was the tumultuous life that surged all round
me. True, the very intensity of this life somehow drew us still
closer together. When disengaged Ilyich used to call me out from
the People's Commissariat of Education to go for a walk together
through the Kremlin, or to drive out of town to the woods, or
simply to have a chat. But he was very busy all the time. I had
got into the habit of not asking Ilyich any questions whenever
we met, and he would never tell me about his recent experiences
beyond a few casual remarks until some time had passed. Usually
he would start off on a train of thought which those experiences
had suggested. Even now, years afterwards, when rereading
Ilyich's articles, I catch the very tones in which he had
uttered this or that phrase in conversation before it had come
to be written down in his article. But things like this baffle
description. As a result reminiscences are bound to be very
fragmentary and episodic. I had decided, therefore, to write no
reminiscences at all covering the Soviet period. But then I
thought that, given against the general background of events,
such reminiscences, however fragmentary, might be of some
interest. The background itself should merely be the setting,
but not a history of events. I am not sure that I will be able
to do it. However, since comrades are interested in every little
detail that concerns Vladimir Ilyich, I shall try. The
accompanying chapters are my first attempt at reminiscences of
that type.</p><p>
