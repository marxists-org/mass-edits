On the Eve of the Uprising</h1>

<p>
On October 7 Ilyich moved to Petrograd from Vyborg. It was
decided to keep his whereabouts a strict secret, and not even
the members of the Central Committee were to know his address. He
was put up at Marguerite Fofanova's, in a big building on the
corner of Lesnoi Prospekt, Vyborg District, tenanted almost
exclusively by workers. It was a very convenient place, the
family, including the servant, still being out in the country,
where they had gone for the summer. Fofanova herself was an ardent
Bolshevik, who ran all Ilyich's errands for him. Three days later,
on October 10, Ilyich attended a meeting of the Central Committee
at Sukhanova's apartment, where a resolution was adopted calling
for an armed uprising. Ten members of the C.C. voted in favour of
the resolution. They were Lenin, Sverdlov, Stalin, Dzerzhinsky,
Trotsky, Uritsky, Kollontai, Bubnov, Sokolnikov, and
Lomov. Zinoviev and Kamenev voted against it.</P>
<p>
On October 15 a meeting of the Petrograd organization took
place at Smolny (this in itself was significant). Delegates from
the various districts were present, including eight from the
Vyborg District. I remember Dzerzhinsky speaking in favour of an
armed uprising, while Chudnovsky opposed it. The latter had been
wounded at the front and his arm was in a sling. Deeply agitated,
he argued that we would suffer inevitable defeat, that we should
take our time about it. "Dying for the revolution is the easiest
thing, but we shall only harm the cause of the revolution by
letting ourselves be shot down," he said. Chudnovsky, in fact, did
die for the revolution, losing his life during the Civil War. He
was no phrasemonger, but his view was absolutely wrong. I do not
remember the other speeches. When it was put to the vote the
resolution in favour of an immediate uprising was carried by an
overwhelming majority. The Vyborg delegates voted for it in a
body.</P>
<p>
Next day, the 16th, an enlarged meeting of the Central
Committee was held at the offices of the Lesnoi Prospekt
Sub-District Council, which was attended also by members of the
Executive of the Petrograd Committee, the military organization,
the Petrograd Trade-Union Council of factory committees, the
Petrograd Okrug Committee and representatives of the
railwaymen. Two lines were discussed at this meeting &#8211; that of the
majority, who stood for an immediate uprising, and that of the
minority, who were against it. Lenin's resolution was carried by
an overwhelming majority of 19 votes, with 2 against and 4
abstentions. The question was decided. At a closed meeting of the
Central Committee a Military Revolutionary Centre was elected.</P>
<p>
Very few people were allowed to see Ilyich. The only ones who
visited him were I, Maria Ilyinichna, and occasionally Rahja. I
recall the following incident. Ilyich had sent Fofanova out on
some errand; it was arranged in such cases that he was not to open
the door to anyone or answer the bell. I was to knock at the door
by a pre-arranged signal. Fofanova had a cousin, who attended some
sort of military school. When I came that evening, I found the lad
standing on the landing, his face a study. Seeing me, he said:
"Someone's got into Marguerite's flat, you know." "What d'you
mean?" I said. "Well, I came and rang the bell, and a man's voice
answered me. Then I rang again and again, but no one answered any
more." I told him a tale about Marguerite having gone to a meeting
that day, and that it must have been his imagination playing him
tricks. I did not calm down myself until I had seen him get on a
tram and ride off. I went back and knocked in the pre-arranged
manner, and when Ilyich opened the door I began to scold him. "The
boy might have raised an alarm," I said. "I thought it was
something urgent," Ilyich pleaded in excuse. I was running his
errands, too, all the time. On October 24 he wrote a letter to the
Central Committee urging the necessity of seizing power that very
day. He sent Marguerite with this letter, but, without waiting for
her to come back, he put on his wig and went off to Smolny. Not a
minute was to be lost.</P>
<p>
The Vyborg District was preparing for the uprising. Fifty
women workers sat all night in the council office, where a woman
doctor gave them instructions in first aid. In the rooms of the
District Committee they were busy arming the workers; group after
group came up and received weapons. But there was no one to be put
down in the Vyborg District; only a colonel and several cadets who
had come to have some tea at a workers' club were arrested. In the
night Zhenya Yegorova and I went down to Smolny in a lorry to find
out how things were going.</P>
