<BR>
<p>
On the evening of our arrival in Geneva Ilyich wrote a letter
to Alexinsky &#8211; the Bolshevik deputy in the Second Duma, who had
been sentenced to penal servitude together with the other
Bolshevik deputies, had emigrated abroad and was now living in
Austria &#8211; in reply to his letter received in Berlin. A few days
later he answered Maxim Gorky, who had been pressing Ilyich to
visit him on Capri.</P>
<p>
It was impossible to go to Capri, as work had to be started
on Proletary, the illegal Central Organ of the Party. This had to
be done as quickly as possible in order to provide a regular
leadership through the Central Organ in those difficult days of
reaction. Ilyich could not go, but he could dream of it when
writing back to Gorky: "It would be wonderful to take a run over
to Capri!" and continued: "I think it would be best to come over
when you are not too busy with your work, so that we can loaf
about and chat." Ilyich had experienced and thought over so much
in the last few years that he looked forward eagerly to a
heart-to-heart talk with Gorky. He was obliged, however, to
postpone his visit.</P>
<p>
It had not been decided yet whether <EM>Proletary</EM> was to
be published in Geneva or some other place. We had written about
it to Adler, the Austrian Social-Democrat, and to Juzef
(Dzerzhinsky), who lived in Austria too. Austria was closer to the
Russian frontier, it would be more convenient in some ways to
print the paper there, and easier to arrange transport
facilities. Ilyich, however, had little hope of our being able to
organize publication anywhere but in Geneva, and so he was taking
steps to launch the paper there. We learned, to our surprise, that
the type-setting machine we had used in the old days was still
available. This cut down expenses and simplified matters.</P>
<p>
Vladimirov, the old compositor, who had set the type for the
Bolshevik paper <EM>Vperyod</EM> in Geneva before the 1905
Revolution, turned up. The general business management was
entrusted to D. M. Kotlyarenko.</P>
<p>
By February, all the comrades sent from Russia to organize
<EM>Proletary</EM> &#8211; Lenin, Bogdanov and Innokenty
(Dubrovinsky) &#8211; had assembled in Geneva.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich wrote to Maxim Gorky on February 2: "We have
everything ready and are announcing publication in a day or
two. We have put you down as a contributor. Drop me a line whether
you can give us anything for the first few issues (something in
the style of <EM>Notes on the Petty Bourgeois</EM> from
<EM>Novaya Zhizn</EM> or fragments from the story you are now
writing, etc.)." Ilyich had written about bourgeois culture and
the petty bourgeois, which he deeply hated and despised, as far
back as 1894 in his book <EM>What the "Friends of the People" Are
and How They Fight the Social-Democrats.</EM> Gorky's notes on
philistinism therefore greatly appealed to him.</P>
<p>
Ilyich wrote to Lunacharsky, who was staying with Gorky at
Capri: "Drop me a line whether you are fixed up all right and
whether you are fit for work again." </P>
<p>
The editorial board (Lenin, Rogdanov and Innokenty) wrote a
letter to Trotsky in Vienna, asking him to contribute to the
paper. Trotsky refused. He did not want to cooperate with the
Bolsheviks, but he did not say so openly. He excused himself on
the grounds that he was too busy.</P>
<p>
Arrangements had to be made for shipping the paper to
Russia. We started tracing old contacts. Our consignments used to
be shipped by sea via Marseilles and other ports. Ilyich thought
that shipment could now be arranged by way of Capri, where
Gorky lived. He wrote to Maria Andreyeva, Gorky's wife, to arrange
for the literature to be forwarded on to Odessa through the ships'
employees and workers. He got in touch with Alexinsky for shipment
via Vienna, but had little hope of success in that
quarter. Alexinsky was quite unfitted for that kind of work. We
invited over our "shipping expert" Pyatnitsky, now a worker on the
Comintern, who had done a good job in the past in smuggling
literature across the German frontier. But it took Pyatnitsky
(who was in Russia) nearly eight months to throw the police off
the scent, evade arrest and cross the frontier. On arriving abroad
he tried to organize shipments through Lvov, but nothing came of
it. He arrived in Geneva in the autumn of 1908. We arranged that
he was to take up his residence again in Leipzig, where he had
lived before, and pick up old contacts and organize shipments
across the German border as he had done in the past.</P>
<p>
Alexinsky decided to move to Geneva. It was intended to enlist
his wife Tatyana to help me with our Russian mail. But these were
only plans. As for letters, we expected them more than we received
them. Shortly after our arrival in Geneva an incident occurred
with the changing of money.</P>
<p>
In July 1907 an expropriation raid had been made in Erivan
Square in Tiflis. At the height of the revolution, when the fight
against the autocracy was waged on an extended front, the
Bolsheviks considered it permissible to seize tsarist funds by
making raids of expropriation. The money obtained in the Tiflis
raid was handed over to the Bolsheviks for revolutionary
purposes. But the money could not be used. It was all in 500-
ruble notes, which had to be changed. This could not be done in
Russia, as the banks always had lists of the note numbers in such
cases. Now when the reaction was rampant, it was necessary to
arrange escapes from prison, where the tsarist government was
brutally treating the revolutionaries; to keep the movement alive
it was necessary to organize illegal printing plants, etc. The
money was badly needed. And so a group of comrades made an attempt
to change the 500-ruble notes simultaneously in various towns
abroad, just a few days after our arrival. Zhitomirsky, an agent
provocateur, knew about this and took part in organizing the
exchange. No one knew at the time that he was a spy, and he
enjoyed full confidence, although he had already betrayed Comrade
Kamo, who was arrested in Berlin with a suitcase containing
dynamite. Kamo was kept in a German prison for a long time and
then handed over to the Russian authorities. Zhitomirsky had
warned the police about the attempt to change the ruble notes, and
those involved in it were arrested. A member of the Zurich group,
a Lett, was arrested in Stockholm, and Olga Ravich, a member of
the Geneva group, who had recently returned from Russia, was
arrested in Munich with Bogdassarian and Khojamirian. In Geneva
N. A. Semashko was arrested after a post card addressed to one of
the arrested men was delivered to his house.</P>
<p>
The Swiss burgher was frightened to death by this
incident. The "Russian expropriators" were the talk of the
town. The thing was discussed with horror around the table of the
boarding-house where Ilyich and I used to go to dine. Mikha
Tskhakaya, our Caucasian comrade, chairman of the Third Party
Congress in 1905, lived in Geneva at the time, and when he first
came to see us his foreign appearance gave our landlady such a
fright that she slammed the door in his face with a shriek of
terror, taking him for a real expropriator.</P>
<p>
Ultra-opportunist moods prevailed in the Swiss Party at the
time, and in connection with the arrest of Semashko, the Swiss
Social-Democrats declared that theirs was the most democratic
country in the world, that justice reigned supreme there, and that
therefore they could not tolerate crimes against property in their
territory.</P>
<p>
The Russian Government demanded the extradition of the
arrested persons. The Swedish Social-Democrats were prepared to
intervene, but demanded only that the Zurich group, to which one
of the arrested comrades belonged, should confirm that the lad who
had been arrested in Stockholm was a Social-Democrat and had been
living all the time in Zurich. The Zurich group, in which the
Mensheviks predominated, refused to do it. The Mensheviks hastened
also to dissociate themselves from Semashko in the local Berne
press, in which they tried to make out that Semashko was not a
Social-Democrat and had not represented the Geneva group at the
Stuttgart Congress.</P>
<p>
The Mensheviks had condemned the Moscow uprising of 1905; they
were against anything that was likely to scare away the liberal
bourgeoisie. The fact that the bourgeois intelligentsia had swung
away from the revolution at the moment of its defeat was accounted
for by them as being due not to its class character but to the
fact that the Bolsheviks had frightened it by their methods of
struggle. The Bolsheviks' contention that expropriation from the
expropriators during the height of the revolutionary struggle was
a legitimate method of raising funds for revolutionary purposes,
was strongly condemned by them. The Bolsheviks, they said, had
frightened away the liberal bourgeoisie. The fight against the
Bolsheviks played into the hands of the Mensheviks, and in this
fight all means were fair.</P>
<p>
In a letter dated February 26, 1908, to Plekhanov,
P. B. Axelrod set forth his plan of making use of this incident to
discredit the Bolsheviks in the eyes of the foreigners. He
suggested that a report should be drawn up, translated into German
and French, and forwarded to the German Party headquarters
(Vorstand), to Kautsky, Adler, the International Socialist Bureau,
to London and so forth.</P>
<p>
This letter of Axelrod's, published many years later (in
1926), is striking proof of how widely the paths of the Bolsheviks
and Mensheviks had diverged already at that time.</P>
<p>
In connection with the arrest of N. A. Semashko, Vladimir
Ilyich, in his capacity of R.S.D.L.P. representative, sent an
official statement to the International Socialist Bureau. He also
wrote to Gorky, saying that if he knew Semashko personally from
Nizhny days he ought to come out in his defence in the Swiss
press. Semashko was soon released.</P>
<p>
It was difficult for us, after the revolution, to get used to
life in emigration again. Vladimir Ilyich spent all his days in
the library, and in the evenings we did not know what to do with
ourselves. We had no desire to sit in the cold cheerless room we
had rented and longed to be among people. Every evening we went
to the cinema or the theatre, although we seldom stayed to the
end, and usually left in the middle of a show to wander about the
streets, most often around the lake.</P>
<p>
At last, in February, the first Geneva issue of
<EM>Proletary</EM> (No. 21) came out. Vladimir Ilyich's first
article in it was characteristic. He wrote:</P>
<p>
"We knew how to work during the long years preceding the
revolution. Not for nothing do they say we are as firm as a
rock. The Social-Democrats have formed a proletarian party which
will not lose heart at the failure of the first armed onslaught,
will not lose its head, and will not be carried away by
adventures. That party is marching towards socialism, without
binding itself or its future with the issue of any particular
period of bourgeois revolutions. Precisely for that reason it is
also free from the weak sides of bourgeois revolutions.. And that
proletarian party is marching to victory." </P>
<P>These words of Vladimir Ilyich's expressed thoughts that
dominated the whole of his life at the time. At the moment
of defeat he was thinking of the proletariat's sweeping
victories. He talked about this during our evening walks along the
shore of Lake Geneva.</P>
<p>
Adoratsky, who was deported from Russia in 1906 and went back
at the beginning of 1908, was still in Geneva when we arrived. He
recalls the talks he had with Ilyich concerning the character of
the next revolution and that this revolution was bound to place
the power in the hands of the proletariat. Adoratsky's
reminiscences fully dovetail with the spirit of the article
mentioned above and with everything else that Ilyich said at the
time. That the defeat of the proletariat was merely a temporary
setback Ilyich never for a moment doubted.</P>
<p>
Adoratsky also recalls that Vladimir Ilyich made him "write a
full account of the events of 1905 and the October days, with
special reference to the lessons to be drawn from such questions
as the arming of the workers, the organization of fighting squads,
the organization of the uprising and the seizure of power."</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich held that the experience of the revolution
should be studied very carefully, as this experience would come in
useful. He got hold of every participant in the recent struggle
and had long talks with him. He considered that it was the task of
the Russian working class "to safeguard the traditions of the
revolutionary struggle, which the intelligentsia and the petty
bourgeoisie were hastening to renounce; to develop and strengthen
these traditions, inculcate them into the minds of the broad
masses of the people, and sustain them for the next inevitable
upswing of the democratic movement." </P>
<P>The workers themselves," he wrote, "are pursuing this line
spontaneously. They lived through the great struggle of October
and December too passionately; they saw only too clearly that
their conditions could change <EM>only </EM>as a result of this
direct revolutionary struggle. They say now, or at least they feel
like that mill worker, who in a letter to his trade-union paper
declared: 'The bosses have robbed us of our gains, the foremen are
bullying us again the way they did before; <EM>but you wait, we'll
have another 1905.'</EM></P>
<p>
"Wait, we'll have another 1905. That is how the workers look
at it. To the workers that year of struggle was an example of
<EM>what to do</EM>. To the intelligentsia and the renegade petty
bourgeois it was a 'mad year,' an example of <EM>what not to
do</EM>. To the proletariat, the study and critical assimilation
of the experience of the revolution means learning to apply the
methods of struggle <EM>of that time more effectually,</EM>
learning to convert that October strike movement and December
armed struggle into something broader, more concentrated and more
class-conscious."</P>
<P>Ilyich saw the years ahead as years of preparation for a new onslaught.</P>
<p>
The "respite" in the revolutionary struggle had to be used
for the purpose of deepening its content still more.</P>
<p>
In the first place a line of struggle adapted to the
conditions of reaction had to be worked out. It was necessary to
plan the Party's switch over to underground activities while
enabling it at the same time to make use of legal facilities and
keep the Duma forum as a means of speaking to the broad masses of
the workers and peasants. Ilyich noticed a tendency among many
Bolsheviks, the so-called Otzovists, to simplify the problem; in
their anxiety at all cost to preserve the forms of struggle that
had proved expedient when the tide of the revolution was at its
highest, they were actually quitting the struggle in face of the
difficult conditions created by the reaction, withdrawing in face
of the difficulties of adapting the work to the new
conditions. Ilyich qualified Otzovism as Liquidationism from the
Left. An avowed Otzovist was Alexinsky. When he returned to Geneva
relations between him and Ilyich quickly deteriorated. Ilyich had
to deal with him on quite a number of questions, and the man's
self-opinionated narrow-mindedness repelled him more than
ever. The fact that the Duma, even under the reaction, could be
used as a medium of contact with the broad masses of the workers
and peasants, did not interest Alexinsky in the least. All the
same he could not use this rostrum any more since the Second Duma
had been dissolved. The self-centred piggishness of the man stood
out in glaring relief against the Geneva background, and yet he
was still considered a Bolshevik at the time. I remember the
following incident. I was walking down the Rue Carouge one day
(the "Caruzhka," as we called it, had long been a Russian emigrant
centre), when I saw two Bundists standing in the middle of the
pavement with a bewildered air. Together with Alexinsky, they
constituted a committee elected for editing the minutes of the
London Congress (these minutes first came out in Geneva in
1908). After an argument about some formulation, Alexinsky had
begun to shout, then had snatched up all the papers from the table
and run away. I looked round and saw his short figure turning the
corner in the distance. He was striding along swiftly with his
head proudly raised and a batch of huge files under his arms. It
was not even funny.</P>
<p>
It was not a matter of Alexinsky alone, though. Obviously,
the former unity among the Bolshevik group was lacking and a split
threatened, a split with Bogdanov in the first place.</P>
<p>
A volume entitled <EM>Studies in the Philosophy of
Marxism</EM> appeared in Russia containing essays by Bogdanov,
Lunacharsky, Bazarov, Suvorov, Berman, Yushkevich and
Gelfand. These <EM>Studies</EM> were an attempt to revise the
materialist philosophy, the Marxist materialist conception of the
development of humanity, the conception of the class struggle.</P>
<p>
The new philosophy was a loophole for a hodgepodge of
mysticism. Decadent moods among the intelligentsia during the
years of reaction were favourable to the spread of
revisionism. Obviously the line had to be drawn.</P>
<p>
Ilyich had always been interested in questions of
philosophy. He had studied it closely in exile, was familiar with
everything that Marx, Engels and Plekhanov had written in that
field. He had studied Hegel, Feuerbach and Kant. While still in
exile in Siberia he had had heated discussions with comrades who
inclined towards Kant, he followed all that was written on the
subject in the <EM>Neue Zeit</EM>, and was on the whole fairly
well-grounded in philosophy.</P>
<p>
The story of his differences with Bogdanov was told by Ilyich
in his letter of February 25 to Gorky. Ilyich had read
Bogdanov's book <EM>Fundamentals of the Historical Conception of
Nature</EM> in Siberian exile, but Bogdanov's position at the time
had been a stage in his transition to his later philosophic
views. In 1903, when Ilyich was working with Plekhanov, the
latter had often criticized Bogdanov for his philosophic
opinions. Bogdanov's book <EM>Empiriomonism</EM> appeared in 1904,
and Ilyich told Bogdanov outright that he considered Plekhanov's
view right and not his, Bogdanov's.</P>
<p>
"In the summer and autumn of 1904 Bogdanov and I came to terms
as Bolsheviks," Ilyich wrote to Gorky, "and concluded that tacit
bloc tacitly ruling out philosophy as neutral ground, which
existed throughout the revolution and enabled us to jointly carry
out the tactics of revolutionary Social-Democracy (=Bolshevism),
tactics, which, I am profoundly convinced, were the only correct
ones to adopt.</P>
<p>
"There was little time for philosophy at the height of the
revolution. Bogdanov wrote another thing in prison at the
beginning of 1906 &#8211; Part III of his <EM>Empiriomonism,</EM> I
believe. He presented me with a copy of it in the summer of 1906
and I sat down to make a careful study of it. After reading it I
was furious. It became clearer to me than ever before that he was
taking an absolutely wrong non-Marxist line. I wrote him then a
'declaration of love' &#8211; a little letter on philosophy running into
three notebooks. I explained to him there that I was, of course,
just an ordinary Marxist in philosophy, and that it was his clear,
popularly and splendidly written works that had definitely
convinced me that he was essentially wrong and Plekhanov right. I
showed those note-books to some friends (Lunacharsky among them)
and was going to have them published under the title <EM>Notes of
art Ordinary Marxist on Philosophy,</EM> but did not do so. I am
sorry now that I did not publish them immediately.</P>
<p>
"Now the<EM> Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism</EM> has
appeared. I have read all the articles except Suvorov's (which I
am reading now), and every article made me positively furious. I
would rather be drawn and quartered than agree to cooperate with a
publication or body which preaches this sort of thing.</P>
<p>
"I was tempted to take up again the<EM> Notes of an Ordinary
Marxist on Philosophy</EM> and I started to write them, but in the
opinions I expressed to Bogdanov in the course of reading the
<EM>Studies</EM> I was, of course, blunt and outspoken." </P>
<p>
That is how Vladimir Ilyich described the affair to Gorky.</P>
<p>
At the time the first number of <EM>Proletary</EM>
published abroad made its appearance (February 13, 1908), the
relations between Ilyich and Bogdanov were strained to the
utmost.</P>
<p>
At the end of March Ilyich had been of the opinion that
philosophical disputes could and should be detached from Political
groupings within the Bolshevik section. He believed that such
disputes in the section would show better than anything else that
Bogdanov's philosophy could not be put on the same level as
Bolshevism.</P>
<p>
It grew clearer every day, however, that the Bolshevik group would soon fall apart.</P>
<p>
During that difficult time Ilyich became more friendly than ever with Innokenty (Dubrovinsky).</P>
<p>
Up to 1905 we had known Innokenty only by hearsay. Uncle
(Lydia Knipovich), who had met him in exile in Astrakhan, had
spoken favourably of him. The Samara comrades (the
Krzhizhanovskys) had praised him highly, too, but we had never met
him. We had not corresponded with him either. Only once, after the
Second Congress of the Party, when the squabble with the
Mensheviks flared up, did we receive a letter from him in which he
wrote about the importance of preserving Party unity. Afterwards
he was a member of the conciliatory Central Committee and was
arrested with the other C.C. members at Leonid Andreyev's
flat.</P>
<p>
In 1905 Ilyich saw Innokenty at work. He saw how utterly
devoted Innokenty was to the revolutionary cause, how he undertook
the most dangerous and difficult jobs &#8211; a fact that accounts for
his having been unable to attend a single Party congress; he
always got arrested just before the congress was held. Ilyich saw
what a resolute fighter Innokenty was &#8211; he had taken part in the
Moscow uprising, and had been in Kronstadt during the rising
there. Innokenty was not a literary man. He spoke at meetings of
workers, at the factories, and his speeches inspired the workers
in their struggle. No one wrote those speeches down, of
course. Ilyich thought a lot of Innokenty for his wholehearted
devotion to the cause and was very glad when he arrived in
Geneva. They had much in common to draw them together. Both
attached tremendous importance to the Party and considered it
necessary to wage a determined struggle against the Liquidators,
who argued that the illegal Party should be dissolved because it
only hindered the work. Both had a very high opinion of Plekhanov,
and were glad that he had not sided with the Liquidators. Both
held that Plekhanov was right in the philosophic field, that it
was to dissociate definitely from Bogdanov on philosophic
issues, and that the fight on the philosophic front had now
assumed particular importance. Ilyich saw that there was no one so
quick to understand him as Innokenty was. Innokenty used to have
his meals with us, and after dinner they would sit for a long time
discussing the plans of work and the situation that had arisen. In
the evenings they would meet in the Cafe Landolt to continue their
discussions. Ilyich was so "drunk with philosophy," as he called
it, that he infected Innokenty with it. All this tended to draw
them still closer together. Ilyich became strongly attached to
Inok (Innokenty) at the time.</P>
<p>
They were difficult times. In Russia the organizations
were going to pieces. The police, with the aid of agent
provocateurs, had arrested the leading Party workers. Big meetings
and conferences became impossible. It was not so easy for people,
who had only recently been in the eye of the public, to go
underground. In the spring (April-May) Kamenev and Warski (a
Polish Social-Democrat and intimate friend of Dzerzhinsky, Tyszka
and Rosa Luxemburg) were arrested in the street. A few days later
Zinoviev, and then N. A. Rozhkov (a Bolshevik, member of our C.C.)
were arrested, too, in the street. The masses withdrew into
themselves. They wanted to think things over, try to understand
what had happened; agitation of a general kind had palled and no
longer satisfied anyone. People readily joined the study-circles,
but there was no one to take charge of them. These moods provided
a favourable soil for Otzovism. Left without the leadership of the
Party organization, acting on their own apart from and
independently of the main mass struggle, the fighting squads
degenerated, and Innokenty was obliged to handle many a difficult
case which had arisen in consequence.</P>
<p>
Gorky invited Ilyich to Capri (where Bogdanov, Bazarov and
others were living at the time) in order to come to a general
agreement, but Ilyich did not want to go &#8211; he had a presentiment
that no understanding was possible. In his letter of April 16 to
Gorky he wrote:</P>
<p>
"My going is useless and harmful. I cannot and will not have
anything to do with people who have set out to preach a union of
scientific socialism and religion. The days of copy-book
controversy have passed. There is nothing to argue about, and it's
silly to upset one's nerves for nothing." </P>
<p>
Yielding to Gorky's urgent requests, however, Ilyich did go to
Capri in May, but he spent only a couple of days there. The visit,
of course, brought no conciliation with Bogdanov's philosophical
views. Ilyich afterwards related how he had told Bogdanov and
Bazarov &#8211; "I'm afraid we'll have to separate for two or three
years," and how Maria Fyodorovna, Gorky's wife, had laughingly
called him to order.</P>
<p>
Gorky's place was filled with a crowd of noisy bustling
people playing chess or boating. Ilyich did not have very much to
say about this trip. He spoke mostly about the beautiful scenery,
the sea, and the local wine, but was reticent about the talk on
painful subjects that had taken place there.</P>
<P>Ilyich took up the study of philosophy again.</P>
<p>
This is how he describes the situation in a letter to
Vorovsky which he wrote in the summer of 1908. Vorovsky was a
comrade he had worked with on <EM>Vperyod </EM>and during the
Revolution of 1905. He lived in Odessa at the time.</P>
<P>"My dear friend,</P>
<p>
"Thanks for your letter. Both your 'suspicions' are wrong. I
was not fretting, but the situation here is a difficult one. We
are heading for a break with Bogdanov The real reason is that
he has taken offence at the sharp criticism of his papers (by no
means on the editorial board) on philosophy. Bogdanov now is
trying to find points of difference. He has dragged out the
boycott theme again together with Alexinsky, who is kicking up the
devil of a row, so much so that I have been obliged to break off
all relations with him.</P>
<p>
"They are building up a split on empiriomonistic-boycottist
grounds. Things are quickly coming to a head. A fight at the next
conference is unavoidable. A split is highly probable. I will
leave the group as soon as the line of 'Left' and true
'boycottism' gains the upper hand. I asked you to come because I
thought your speedy arrival would help to keep them quiet. We
absolutely count on you attending the conference in August, New
Style. You must arrange it in such a way that you can come out. We
shall send money for the journey for all the
Bolsheviks. Pass the slogan down to the local organizations that
mandates should be given only to local and actual Party
workers. We ask you earnestly to write for our paper. We can pay
now for articles, and will pay regularly. Sincerely yours."</P>
<p>
"Do you know a publisher who would undertake to publish what
I am now writing on philosophy?" </P>
<p>
At that time the Bolsheviks were well provided with funds.</P>
<P>Twenty-three-year-old Nikolai Schmidt, a nephew of Morozov and
owner of a furniture factory in Moscow (Presnya District), went
over to the workers in 1905 and became a Bolshevik. He provided
money for <EM>Novaya Zhizn</EM> and for the purchase of weapons,
and became a close friend of the workers. The police called his
factory a "devil's nest." The factory played an important part
during the Moscow uprising. Schmidt was arrested and brutally
treated in prison. They took him to see what they had done to his
factory, showed him the murdered workers, and finally killed him
in prison. Before he died he managed to let his friends outside
know that he was bequeathing his property to the Bolsheviks.</P>
<p>
His younger sister, Elizaveta Schmidt, decided to give her
share of the inheritance to the Bolsheviks. As she was not yet of
age, however, a fictitious marriage had to be arranged so that she
could dispose of her money at her own discretion. She went through
a form of marriage with Ignatyev, a member of the fighting squad
who had managed to keep on a legal footing, and she could now
dispose of her legacy, for which the consent of her husband was
needed. Actually, Elizaveta was the wife of another Bolshevik,
Victor Taratuta. The fictitious marriage enabled her to obtain the
legacy immediately and hand the money over to the Bolsheviks. That
explains why Ilyich wrote so confidently about <EM>Proletary
</EM>now being able to pay for contributions and money being sent
to the delegates for the journey.</P>
<p>
Victor Taratuta came to Geneva in the summer, and gave a hand
in business matters. He conducted the correspondence with other
foreign centres in the capacity of secretary of the Foreign Bureau
of the Central Committee.</P>
<p>
Contacts with Russia were gradually restored and
correspondence resumed, but I still had a lot of free time on my
hands. It looked as if we would have to stay on abroad for a long
time yet, and I decided to tackle French in real earnest so as to
be able to take part in the work of the local Social Democratic
Party. I took a course in French arranged in the summer for
foreign teachers of French at the Geneva University. I studied the
methods of foreign teachers, and learned Swiss efficiency as
well as the French language.</P>
<p>
Tired out by work on his book on philosophy, Ilyich would
take my French grammars and books dealing with the history of the
language and the study of its idiom, and read them for hours,
lying in bed, until his nerves, unstrung by philosophic disputes,
relaxed again. I also began to study the system of school training
in Geneva. I realized for the first time what a bourgeois school
"for the people" was. saw excellent buildings with lofty windows
in which the children of workers were trained to be docile
slaves. I saw the school-masters in one and the same classroom
boxing the ears of workers' children and never touching the
children of the rich. I saw how every child's mind was stifled of
independent thought, how all learning was taught by cramming, and
how at every step the worship of power and wealth was inculcated
in the children. I never imagined that anything of the kind could
exist in a democratic country. I shared my impressions with
Ilyich, and he would hear me out attentively.</P>
<p>
During our first emigration (up to 1905), when Ilyich
observed life abroad, it was the labour movement that claimed his
chief attention; he was interested most of all in workers
meetings, demonstrations, etc. Up to the time Ilyich left the
country in 1901 we had had nothing of the kind in Russia. Now,
after the Revolution of 1905, after having experienced the mighty
upsurge of the workers' movement in Russia, after the struggle
between the parties, the experience of the Duma, and especially
after the appearance of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies, he still
took an interest in the forms of the labour movement abroad, but
was particularly interested in seeing what a bourgeois democratic
republic was in real life, what role the masses of the workers
played in it, how great their influence in it was, and how great
the influence of other parties.</P>
<p>
I particularly remember the tone of mingled astonishment and
scorn in which Ilyich repeated the words of a Swiss M.P. who, in
connection with the arrest of Semashko, had said that their
republic had existed for hundreds of years and could not tolerate
any encroachment on the rights or property.</P>
<p>
"The struggle for a democratic republic" was a point in our
programme at the time. Ilyich now visualized the bourgeois
democratic republic more vividly than ever as something more
subtle than tsarism, but nevertheless an instrument for enslaving
the working masses. The whole political structure in a democratic
republic tended to imbue all social life with the bourgeois
spirit.</P>
<p>
I think that if Ilyich had not lived through the Revolution
of 1905 and his second period of emigration, he would not have
been able to write his book <EM>The State and Revolution.</EM></P>
<p>
The controversy on philosophic questions called for the
speedy publication of the book on philosophy which Ilvich had
started. He needed some material which he could not get in
Geneva. Besides, the squabbling that was such a marked feature of
life among the political emigrants, was a great hindrance to his
work. Ilyich therefore decided to go to London to work in the
British Museum and finish his book there.</P>
<p>
In his absence, a lecture by Lunacharsky was announced in
Geneva. Innokenty attended and took part in the debate. Ilyich had
sent him the theses, to which Innokenty had made some
amendments. He was very nervous before lecture day, and sat at our
place all day long with books all round him, making notes. He
spoke well, and declared in his own name and Lenin's that
Bolshevism had nothing in common with the philosophical trend of
Bogdanov (empiriomonism), that he and Lenin advocated dialectic
materialism and sided with Plekhanov.</P>
<p>
Although the paper was read by Lunacharsky, the principal
advocate of empirio-criticism at the meeting was Bogdanov. He
made a violent attack on Innokenty. He knew Innokenty well, knew
that Innokenty stood for a straightforward open fight on the
philosophical front, knew what a strong sense of revolutionary
honour he possessed, and he went out of his way to wound that
feeling. Referring to the lecturer, he said: "A knight rode forth
in a garland of roses, but he was stabbed in the back." Innokenty was not put out by this thrust, of course. He gave Ilyich, on his return from London, a full account of the lecture.</P>
<p>
Ilyich was pleased with his trip to London, where he had
succeeded in collecting the necessary material and working it
up.</P>
<p>
On August 24, shortly after Ilyich's return, a plenary
meeting of the Central Committee was held. It was decided at the
meeting to hasten the convocation of a Party conference. Innokenty
went to Russia to organize the conference. By that time
Liquidationism among the Mensheviks had gained considerable
ground. The Liquidators were out to dissolve the Party and its
illegal organization, which in their opinion only led to failures
and arrests. They wanted to pursue a course of purely legal
activities in the trade unions and various other societies. In
view of the prevailing reaction this meant complete rejection of
all revolutionary activity, rejection of leadership, the surrender
of all positions. On the other hand, the Ultimatumists and
Otzovists in the ranks of the Bolshevik group went to the other
extreme: they were opposed to working not only in the Duma but
also in cultural and educational organizations, clubs, schools,
legal trade unions and workers' insurance societies. They withdrew
completely from wide activity among the masses, and abandoned the
leadership of them.</P>
<p>
Innokenty and Ilyich often discussed the necessity of
combining Party leadership (for which purpose the illegal Party
machinery had to be retained at all costs) with broad work among
the masses. Preparations for the Party conference were the order
of the day. The elections of delegates to it would have to be
utilized for launching an extensive campaign against
Liquidationism from the Right and Left.</P>
<p>
It was to carry out this plan that Innokenty went to
Russia. He took up residence in St. Petersburg, where he organized
the work of the C.C,. Five, consisting of himself, Meshkovsky
(Goldenberg), the Menshevik M. I. Broido, a representative of the
Bund and a Lettish representative. He also organized a bureau of
which Golubkov, afterwards a delegate of the C.C. Bureau to the
Party conference, was a member. Innokenty himself did not attend
the conference, which was held in December 1908 &#8211; about a fortnight
before the conference was to take place he was arrested at the
Warsaw Railway Station just as he was about to leave the country,
and was exiled to the Vologda Gubernia.</P>
<p>
The police happened to be very well informed about Innokenty's
mission in Russia. There is no doubt that this was the handiwork
of Zhitomirsky. Another person drafted in to help with the work of
the C.C. Bureau which Innokenty had organized was Lucy, the wife
of Serov, deputy to the Second Duma. This Lucy soon turned out to
be an agent provocateur too.</P>
<p>
Ilyich finished his book on philosophy in September, after
Innokenty had left for Russia. It was not published until much
later &#8211; in May 1909.</P>
<P>We had settled down in Geneva for good.</P>
<p>
My mother arrived and we set up house on our own in a small
apartment. On the surface our life dropped into a smooth
rut. Maria Ilyinichna arrived from Russia too; other comrades
began to arrive. I remember Skrypnik arriving &#8211; he was studying
cooperative problems at the time. I went with him as interpreter
to the Swiss M.P. Sigg (a terrible opportunist); Skrypnik
discussed the cooperative movement with him, but these talks
yielded little results, for Sigg and Skrypnik approached the
question from different angles. Skrypnik's approach was that of a
revolutionary, whereas to Sigg the cooperative movement was
nothing but well-organized "shopkeeping."</P>
<p>
Zinoviev and Lilina arrived from Russia. A baby boy had been
born to them, and they settled down to build a nest. Kamenev and
his family arrived. After St. Petersburg, everyone found life dull
and nostalgic in this quiet
little backwood of Geneva. Everyone longed to move to some big centre. The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries had already moved to Paris. Ilyich was in two minds. One advantage of Geneva was that life there was cheaper, and provided better facilities for studying. Then Lyadov and Zhitomirsky arrived from Paris and urged us to go there. Various arguments were used: 1. We would be able to take part in the French movement; 2. Paris was a big city, and we were less likely to be spied on there. The latter argument clinched the matter for Ilyich. Late in the autumn we began preparing to leave for Paris.</P>
<p>
In Paris we spent the most trying years of our emigrant life
abroad. Ilyich always looked back upon them with a heavy
feeling. He would often remark later: "What the devil made us go
to Paris!" It was not the devil who drove us there but the need to
swing into the struggle for Marxism, the struggle for Leninism and
the Party in that centre of the Russian political emigrants such
as Paris was during those years of reaction.</P>
