<p>
We left for Paris in the middle of December. A Party
conference was to take place there on the 21st jointly with the
Mensheviks. Vladimir Ilyich was utterly engrossed in this
conference. The situation called for proper appraisal, and the
Party line had to be straightened out to ensure that the Party
remained a class party, the vanguard, capable even during the
hardest times of keeping in close touch with the rank and file,
the masses, of helping them to overcome all difficulties and
organize themselves for fresh battles. A check had to be given to
the Liquidators. Contacts with the organizations in Russia were
poor, and the conference could not rely on any appreciable support
from that quarter (the only delegates from Russia were two
Muscovites &#8211; Baturin from the Urals, followed the next day by Third
Duma member Poletayev from St. Petersburg). The Otzovists, rallied
in a separate group, were worked up to a strong pitch of
excitement. Prior to the conference the Mensheviks had convened a
congress of their emigrant groups in Basle, at which a number of
breakaway resolutions were adopted. The atmosphere was tense.</P>
<p>
Ilyich might not have noticed the great stir and fuss we
women made in fixing up our new domestic den for all the interest
he took in it. We rented an apartment right on the edge of the
town in the Rue Bonier, a street running off the Avenue d'Orleans
not far from the Parc Montsouris. It was a large airy flat, which
even had mirrors over the fireplaces &#8211; a fixture in all the new
houses. There was my mother's room, Maria Ilyinichna's (she had
arrived in Paris by this time), our own room and a living
room. This rather luxurious apartment, however, did not fit in
with our way of living and with the "furniture" which we had
brought from Geneva. The scorn with which the concierge eyed our
white deal tables, plain chairs and stools! Our living room
contained just a couple of chairs and a small table. The place was
anything but cosy.</P>
<p>
I had my hands full right away with all kinds of domestic
cares. Household affairs had been much simpler in Geneva. Here it
was a great bother. To get the gas connected I had to go up to
town three times before I received the necessary written
order. The amount of red tape in France is unbelievable. To get
books from the lending library you must have a householder to
stand surety for you, and our landlord, seeing our miserable
furniture, hesitated to do so. The housekeeping, too, at the
beginning was a terrible bother. I was not much of a housekeeper;
Ilyich and Innokenty were of a different mind, but people who were
accustomed to seeing a house run properly were extremely critical
of my facile approach.</P>
<p>
Life in Paris was a hectic affair. Russian political
emigrants were flocking to Paris at that time from all over
Europe. Ilyich seldom sat at home during that year. Our people
used to sit about in the cafes till late at night. Taratuta was a
great lover of cafe life. Gradually the others acquired the
habit.</P>
<p>
After heated debates at the December Party Conference, we
managed nevertheless to chart out a common
line. <EM>Sotsial-Demokrat</EM> was to become the organ of the
Party as a whole. At the plenary meeting held after the conference
a new editorial board was elected, consisting of Lenin, Zinoviev,
Kamenev, Martov and Marchlewski. Nine issues of the paper were put
out during the year. Martov was in a minority of one on the new
editorial board, and he often forgot about his Menshevism. I
remember Ilyich once remarking with satisfaction that it was good
to work with Martov, as he was an exceedingly gifted
journalist. But that was only until Dan arrived.</P>
<p>
As to the position within the Bolshevik group, relations with
the Otzovists became more strained than ever. The Otzovists became
very assertive. By the end of February relations with them were
broken off completely.</P>
<p>
For about three years prior to this we had been working with
Bogdanov and the Bogdanovites hand in hand, and not just working,
but fighting side by side. Fighting for a common cause draws
people together more than anything. Ilyich, on the other hand, was
wonderful at being able to fire people with his ideas, infect them
with his enthusiasm, while at the same time bringing out the best
in them, taking from them what others had failed to take. Every
comrade working with him seemed, as it were, to have a part of
Ilyich in him, and that perhaps is why he was so close to
them.</P>
<p>
The conflict within the group was a nerve-wracking
business. I remember Ilyich once coming home after having had
words with the Otzovists. He looked awful, and even his tongue
seemed to have turned grey. We decided
that he was to go to Nice for a week to get away from the hurly-burly and take it easy in the sunshine. He did, and returned fit again.</P>
<p>
Studying in Paris was very inconvenient. The Bibliotheque
Nationale was a long way off. Vladimir Ilyich usually cycled
there, but riding a bicycle in Paris was not what it was in the
suburbs of Geneva. It was a great strain. Those cycle rides tired
him out. The library closed at lunch time. There was a lot of
red-tape in the arrangements for ordering books, and Ilyich swore
at the library, and while he was at it, at Paris in general. I
wrote to a French professor who had been giving French lessons at
the summer courses in Geneva, asking him to recommend some other
good libraries. I received an immediate reply, giving me the
necessary information. Ilyich made the round of all the
libraries mentioned but none of them was suitable. In the end his
bicycle was stolen. He used to leave it on the stairs of a house
next door to the Bibliothetque Nationale and pay the concierge ten
centimes a day for it. When he came for the bicycle and found it
gone, the concierge declared that she had not been hired to look
after the bicycle but only to let Ilyich keep it on the
stairs.</P>
<p>
Riding a bicycle in Paris and the suburbs required great
care. Once, on his way to Juvisy, Ilyich was nearly run over by a
motor-car. He barely managed to jump clear, and the bicycle was
wrecked.</P>
<p>
Innokenty arrived after his escape from
Solvychegodsk. Zhitomirsky very kindly offered him lodgings in his
flat. Innokenty was very ill when he arrived. The chains he had
worn going out to his place of exile had chafed his leg so badly
that they had left deep wounds on it. Our doctors examined his leg
and said a lot of alarming things about it. Ilyich went to consult
Professor Dubouche, an excellent French surgeon, who had worked
in Odessa during the Revolution of 1905. Ilyich went to see him
together with Natasha Gopner, who had known him in Odessa. When
Dubouche heard the awful things our doctor comrades had told
Innokenty, he laughed, and said: "Your doctor comrades are good
revolutionaries, but as doctors they are asses!" Ilyich laughed
until he cried, and afterwards often repeated the
story. Innokenty nevertheless had to take a long course of medical
treatment for his leg.</P>
<p>
Ilyich was very glad that Innokenty had arrived. Both were
elated at the fact that Plekhanov had begun to dissociate himself
from the Liquidators. Plekhanov had already announced his
withdrawal from the editorial board of <EM>Golos Sotsial-Demokrata
(Voice of the Social-Democrat)</EM>, where the Liquidators had
gained control in December 1908. Afterwards, he withdrew his
resignation, but his relations with the Liquidators kept
growing more strained, and when the first volume of the Menshevik
symposium <EM>The Social Movement in Russia at the Beginning of
the Twentieth Century</EM> appeared in 1909 containing an article
by Potresov denying the leading role of the proletariat in the
bourgeois-democratic revolution, Plekhanov on May 26 definitely
resigned from the editorial board of <EM>Goles
Sotsial-Demokrata.</EM> Both Ilyich and Innokenty still hoped that
cooperation with Plekhanov would be possible. The younger
generation did not have the same feelings for Plekhanov that the
older generation of Marxists had, since in the lives of the latter
he had played a decisive role.</P>
<p>
Ilyich and Innokenty took the struggle on the philosophic
front very much to heart. To them philosophy was a weapon in the
struggle, organically bound up with the question of evaluating all
phenomena from the point of view of dialectic materialism, with
the questions of the practical struggle in all directions. Ilyich
wrote to Anna Ilyinichna in Russia, asking her to speed up the
publication Of his book. An enlarged meeting of the editorial
board of <EM>Proletary</EM> was planned, at which it was intended
to make a complete break with the Otzovists. "Things look sad over
here," Vladimir Ilyich wrote to his sister Anna Ilyinichna on May
26. "There will probably be <EM>Spaltung</EM> (a split); I hope in
about a month or six weeks to be able to give you exact
information about it." </P>
<p>
May saw the appearance of Ilyich's book <EM>Materialism and
Empirio-Criticism.</EM> In this book he crossed all the t's and
dotted all the i's of the controversy. For Ilyich the questions of
philosophy had a direct bearing on those of the struggle against
religion. That is why he read a paper on the subject of "Religion
and the Workers' Party" at the <EM>Proletary</EM> club in May, and
wrote an article "Attitude of the Workers' Party towards Religion"
for No. 45 of <EM>Proletary</EM> and another entitled "Classes and
the Party in Their Attitude towards Religion and the Church" for
No. 6 of <EM>Sotsial-Demokrat.</EM> These articles, especially the
one in<EM> Proletary,</EM> have not lost their significance to
this day. They lay heavy stress on the class character of
religion, and show that in the hands of the bourgeoisie religion
is a means of diverting the masses from the class struggle and for
drugging their minds. The fight on this front could not be ignored
or underestimated, but neither could it be oversimplified; the
social roots of religion had to be shown up, and the question
dealt with in all its complexity.</P>
<p>
Ilyich realized the harmfulness of religion when still a boy
of fifteen. He stopped wearing the cross and going to church. In
those days this was not such a simple thing as it is now.</P>
<p>
Most harmful of all, according to Lenin, was the subtle type
of religion, shorn of too patent absurdities and external slavish
forms. Such a religion, he believed, was liable to have a stronger
influence on people. "God-building," the attempt to create a new
religion, a new belief, was to him such a subtle religion.</P>
<P>In June the delegates began to arrive for the enlarged
meeting of the <EM>Proletary </EM>editorial board. As a matter of fact this enlarged editorial board was the Bolshevik Gentle, which at that time also included the Vperyodists.</P>
<p>
Golubkov (Davydov) arrived from Moscow. He was a Party worker
on the Central Committee Bureau in Russia, where he worked under
the direction of Innokenty, and had attended the Paris
Conference in 1908. Shulyatikov (Donat) and Shurkanov, a Duma
deputy (who later turned out to be an agent provocateur),
arrived as well. The latter did not come to attend the
conference, though. Following the French custom, our comrades
went to a cafe with them. Shurkanov attacked the beer, drinking
mug after mug. Shulyatikov drank, too, although it was bad for
him &#8211; he suffered from hereditary alcoholism. The beer
brought on a sharp nervous fit, and on leaving the cafe he
suddenly attacked Shurkanov with his walking stick. Innokenty
and Golubkov could barely manage him. They brought him to our
place. I sat with him while they went to look for a doctor and
rent a room for him in the suburbs. They found a room in the
Fontenay-aux-Roses, where Semashko and Vladimirsky lived.</P>
<p>
I sat with the sick man in our bare living room for about
two hours. He tossed about nervously and kept; jumping up, seeing
visions of his sister, who had been hanged. I tried to calm him,
and divert his thoughts, and held his hand. As soon as I let it go
he became restless again. I was greatly relieved when Innokenty
and Golubkov at last came for him.</P>
<p>
The conference of the enlarged editorial board was attended by
members of the editorial board &#8211; Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev and
Bogdanov, representatives of the Bolshevik locals Tomsky
(St. Petersburg), Shulyatikov (Moscow) and Nakoryakov (the Urals);
members of the Central Committee Innokenty, Rykov, Goldenberg,
Taratuta and Marat (Schanzer). Others present were Skrypnik
(Shchur), Lyubimov (Sommer, Mark), Poletayev (a deputy of the
Third Duma), and Golubkov (Davydov). The conference lasted from
July 4 to 13.</P>
<p>
Resolutions were adopted on the Otzovists and Ultimatumists,
for Party unity, and against the holding of a special Bolshevik
congress. The Capri school was a question apart. Bogdanov had seen
clearly that the Bolshevik group was bound to break up, and had
begun in good time to select and organize his own group. Bogdanov,
Alexinsky, Gorky and Lunacharsky had organized a Social-Democratic
propagandist high school for workers. Pupils for the school were
drafted in Russia by a worker named Vilonov. Staunch reliable men
were chosen. After the experiences of the revolution the workers
keenly felt the need for theoretical training, and besides, the
lull in the struggle now allowed time for that sort of
thing. Although they went to Capri to study, it was clear to
anyone with experience of Party work that the school at Capri
would lay the foundations for a new group. And so the meeting of
the enlarged editorial board of <EM>Proletary</EM> condemned the
organization of a new group. Bogdanov declared that he would not
accept the decisions of the conference, and was expelled from the
Bolshevik group. Krasin supported him. The Bolshevik group was
breaking up.</P>
<p>
Maria Ilyinichna had fallen seriously ill in the spring,
before the enlarged meeting of the editorial board. Ilyich was
greatly upset. Luckily, a timely operation checked the
disease. The operation was made by Dubouche. The convalescence,
however, was rather slow. What she needed was to get out of
town somewhere in the country.</P> 
<P>The conference had told on Ilyich, and he, too, was in need of
a holiday somewhere out in the country, away from all the petty
strife and squabbles of emigrant life. </P>
<P>Ilyich began to scan the French papers for notices of cheap
boarding-houses. He found one such pension in the village of
Bombon in the Department of Sa&ocirc;ne-et-Loire, where they
charged only ten francs a day for four persons. We found it very
comfortable and spent about a month there.</P>
<p>
Ilyich did not work at Bombon, and we tried to avoid talking
shop. We went out for walks and cycled almost every day to the
Clamart woods fifteen kilometres away. We also observed French
ways of life. Among the boarders in our pension were various
clerks, a saleswoman from a big store with her husband and
daughter, a valet to some count, and others of that class.
This petty-bourgeois crowd, steeped in middle-class notions and
prejudices, made a very interesting study. On the one hand, they
were a downright practical crowd, who took good care that the food
was up to standard and everything was made comfortable for
them. On the other hand, they all aped the gentry, for whom they
were anxious to be taken. Madame Lagourette (the saleswoman) was
typical in this respect. She had obviously been through the mill,
and liked to tell risque stories of which she had a large fund,
yet at the same time she dreamt of how she would lead her daughter
Martha to her first communion, saying how touching it would be,
etc., etc. Of course, too large a dose of this mediocrity was
rather boring. It was a good thing that we were able to keep aloof
from them and live our own way. On the whole, Ilyich had a good
holiday at Bombon.</P>
<p>
We changed our quarters in the autumn, moving to an apartment
in a quiet side-street &#8211; Rue Marie Rose &#8211; -in the same
neighbourhood. We had two rooms and a kitchen, with windows
overlooking a garden. We made our living room in the kitchen this
time, and it was there that all heart-to-heart talks were held. In
the autumn Ilyich was all set for work. He laid down a rigorous
"regime" as he called it. He got up at eight, went to the
Bibliotheque Nationale and came home at two. He did a lot of work
at home. I tried my best to keep people away from him. We always
had crowds at our place, a regular crush, especially now that with
the reaction rampant in Russia and the adverse conditions of work
prevailing there the number of Russian political emigrants
kept growing swiftly. People arriving from Russia were full of
enthusiastic accounts of what was going on there, and then somehow
they gradually wilted. The petty worries of emigrant life, the
daily cares and struggles to make a living got them down.</P>
<p>
In the autumn the pupils of the Capri school invited Ilyich
to come over and read them some lectures. Ilvich flatly
refused. He explained to them the factional character of the
school and invited them to Paris. A factional fight started within
the Capri school. At the beginning of November five pupils (there
were twelve in all) including Vilonov, the school's organizer,
took their stand as definite Leninists and were expelled from the
school. Nothing could better have illustrated how right Ilyich had
been in pointing out the factional character of the school. The
expelled pupils came to Paris. I remember our first meeting with
Vilonov. He began to speak about his work in Ekaterinoslav. We had
frequently received correspondence from a worker in Ekaterinoslav
who had signed himself "Misha Zavodsky." His correspondence had
been very interesting and dealt with the most pressing problems of
Party and factory life. "Do you happen to know Misha Zavodsky?" I
asked Vilonov. "Why, that's me," he answered. This immediately
disposed Ilyich in his favour, and he and Misha had a good long
chat that day. Later in the day Ilyich wrote to Gorky: "Dear
Alexei Maximovich. I have been fully convinced all this time that
you and Comrade Misha were the firmest supporters of the new
faction, with whom it would be absurd for me to attempt to speak
in a friendly way. Today I met Comrade Misha for the first time
and had a heart-to-heart talk with him about Party affairs and
about yourself, and I see how badly mistaken I was. My word, the
philosopher Hegel was right: life advances by way of
contradictions, and living contradictions are much richer, more
varied and pithy than the human mind is at first able to grasp. I
regarded the school only as the centre of a new faction. This
proved to be wrong &#8211; not in the sense that it is not the centre of
a new faction (the school has been and still is such a centre),
but in the sense that this is not complete, it is not the whole
truth. Subjectively, certain persons were making such a centre of
the school, and objectively that is what it was, but apart from
this the school drafted real foremost workers from real
working-class life."</P>
<p>
And what passionate faith in the strength of the working
class is implicit in the end of this letter, in which Ilyich
writes about the working class being obliged to forge a party out
of heterogeneous and mixed elements. "It will forge it in any
case, it will forge a splendid revolutionary Social-Democracy in
Russia, forge it sooner than it sometimes seems possible from the
point of view of this thrice cursed state of political emigration,
forge it sooner than we imagine, judging by certain outward
symptoms and separate incidents. Men like Misha are a guarantee of
this." </P>
<P>Five other pupils of the Capri school arrived together with
Misha. Vanya Kazanets (Pankratov) stood out more strongly
opposed to the Capri school than the rest. The others were
Lyushvin (Pakhom), Sozyrev (Foma), Ustinov (Vasily) and Romanov
(Alya Alexinsky). Ilyich read lectures to them with pleasure.
They went back to Russia. Misha had tuberculosis, contracted in
the convict labour gangs, where he was brutally treated. We fixed
him up in Davos. He did not live long there, however. He died on
May 1, 1910.</P>
<p>
The rest of the Capri students arrived in Paris at the end of
December when their studies were over, and Ilyich delivered
lectures to them too. He spoke on current topics, on the Stolypin
reform with its "rich peasant" slant, on the leading role of the
proletariat and on the Duma group. Kozrev said that one of the
Capri pupils, at the beginning, tried to accuse Illyich of
attaching more importance to the work of the Duma than to
agitation among the troops. Ilyich smiled, and went on to talk
about the importance of Duma work. Of course, the idea of work
among the troops being slackened in the least degree was farthest
from his thoughts, but what he did think was that it should be
carried on in greater secrecy. This work, he said, should be done
and not talked about. As it happened, a letter had recently been
received from Toulon from a group of Social-Democrat sailors on
the cruiser <EM>Slava</EM>, asking for literature and, more
particularly for someone to be sent to help carry on revolutionary
work among the sailors. Ilyich had sent a comrade there who was
experienced in secret work. The man had settled in Toulon. Ilyich
did not mention a word about this to the students, of course.</P>
<p>
Living with Russia for ever in his thoughts, Ilyich at the
same time made a careful study of the French labour movement. The
French Socialist Party at the time was out-and-out
opportunistic. In the spring of 1909, for instance, there was a
great strike of the postal employees. The whole city was stirred
up over it, but the Party kept aloof. "This is the business of the
trade unions and not ours," the leaders said. To us Russians such
a division of labour, the withdrawal of the Party from all
participation in the economic struggle was simply monstrous. </P>
<P>Ilyich closely followed the election campaign. All
political issues were submerged in a morass of personal squabbles
and mutual recriminations. As a matter of fact political issues
were not discussed at all. Only a few of the meetings were
interesting. I saw Jaures at one of them. His sway over the crowd
was tremendous, but I did not like his speech &#8211; every word seemed
to be so carefully calculated. I liked Vaillant's speech much
more. This old Communard was a special favourite with the
workers. I remember the figure of a tall worker who had come
straight from work with his shirt sleeves rolled up. He listened
to Vaillant with rapt attention. "That's the stuff to give 'em,
old man!" he exclaimed. Two youngsters, the sons of this worker,
gazed at the speaker with the same ecstatic admiration. But not
all the meetings had a Jaures or a Vaillant to address
them. The ordinary speakers played down to their audiences, saying
one thing to a working-class audience, and another thing to an
audience of intellectuals. Attending the French election meetings
gave us a striking picture of what elections are in a "democratic
republic." To an outside observer, it was simply astonishing. That
is why Ilyich was so fond of the revolutionary music-hall singers
who ridiculed the election campaign. I remember a song describing
how a candidate went canvassing in a village; he drinks with the
peasants, tells them a lot of twaddle, and the tipsy peasants vote
for him, singing: "T'as bien dit, mon gars!" (What you say is
true, lad!). Having got the peasants' votes, the candidate begins
to draw his fifteen thousand francs salary as deputy, and betrays
the interests of the peasants.</P>
<P>A socialist member of the Chamber of Deputies by the name of
Dumas visited us once and told us how he had toured the
countryside canvassing for votes. and it made me think of that
music hall song I had heard. One of the most popular music-hall
singers was Montegus, the son of a Communard and a great favourite
of the faubourgs (the working-class districts). His songs were a
mixture of petty bourgeois sentimentality and genuine
revolutionism.</P>
<p>
Ilyich liked to go to the suburban theatres and watch the
working-class crowd. I remember once going to see a play with
Ilyich describing the brutal treatment of army offenders in
Morocco. It was interesting to watch the way the audience, mostly
workers, responded to every incident. The show had not yet begun,
when suddenly the whole theatre started shouting in one voice:
"Hat! Hat!" A lady had come into the theatre in a high fashionable
hat with feathers, and the audience was demanding that she take it
off. She was obliged to submit. The show started. In
the play a soldier is sent off to Morocco, while his mother and
sister are left to live alone in poverty. The landlord is willing
to let them live rent free if the soldier's sister becomes his
mistress. "The swine! The canaille!" cries flew from all over the
hall. I do not remember the details, but the play showed the
brutal way in which soldiers were treated for refusing to obey
their officers. It ended with a revolt and the singing of the
<EM>Internationale.</EM> This play had been banned for performance
in the centre of the city, but it was performed in the suburbs
to cheering audiences. A demonstration about one hundred thousand
strong was held in 1910 to protest against the adventure in
Morocco. We went to see it. The demonstration was held with the
permission of the police. It was headed by Socialist M.P.'s
wearing red sashes. The workers were in an aggressive mood and
shook their fists as they passed the houses of the wealthy
residential districts. Shutters were hastily put up here and
there, but the demonstration passed off very peacefully. It was
not like a protest demonstration at all.</P>
<p>
Ilyich got in touch with Paul Lafargue through Charles
Rappoport. Lafargue, the son-in-law of Karl Marx, was a well-tried
fighter, of whose opinion Ilyich thought very highly. Paul
Lafargue, with his wife Laura &#8211; Marx's daughter &#8211; lived in
Draveil, about 25 kilometres from Paris. They had already retired
from active work. One day Ilyich and I cycled down to see
them. They received us very kindly. Vladimir Ilyich began to talk
to Lafargue about his book on philosophy, while Laura Lafargue
took me for a walk in the park. I was quite excited &#8211; I was
actually walking with the daughter of Karl Marx! I scrutinized her
face eagerly, anxious to find traits of resemblance with Marx. In
my confusion I babbled incoherently about women taking part in the
revolutionary movement, about Russia. She answered me, but somehow
the conversation flagged. When we got back Lafargue and Ilyich
were discussing philosophy. "He will soon prove the sincerity of
his philosophic convictions," Laura said, referring to her
husband, and they looked at each other rather strangely. I did
not understand the meaning of those words and that glance until I
heard of the death of the Lafargues in 1911. They both died as
atheists, having committed suicide together because old age had
come and they had no strength left for the struggle.</P>
<p>
A plenary meeting of the Central Committee was held in
1910. Resolutions in favour of Party unity and against calling a
special Bolshevik congress had been adopted previously at the
enlarged meeting of the editorial board of Proletary. Ilyich and
the group of comrades who had rallied round him upheld the same
line at the plenary meeting of the Central Committee. It was
extremely important, during the period of reaction, to have a
Party that boldly spoke the whole truth, albeit from
underground. It was a time when the reaction was wrecking the
Party, when the Party was being overwhelmed by opportunism, when
it was important to keep the banner of the Party flying at all
cost. In Russia the Liquidators had a strong legal opportunist
centre of their own. The Party was needed in order to stand up
against that centre.</P>
<p>
The experience of the Capri school had shown how often the
factionalism of the workers was relative and peculiar. The thing
was to have a united Party centre, around which the
Social-Democratic worker masses could rally. The struggle in 1910
was a struggle waged for the very existence of the Party, for
exercising influence on the workers through the medium of the
Party. Vladimir Ilyich never doubted that within the Party the
Bolsheviks would be in the majority, that in the end the Party
would follow the Bolshevik path, but it would have to be a Party
and not a group. Ilyich took the same line in 1911, when a Party
school was being organized near Paris to <EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists and
pro-Party-Mensheviks as well as Bolsheviks were admitted. The same
line was pursued at the Prague Party Conference in 1912. Not a
group, but a Party pursuing a Bolshevik line. Naturally, there was
no room in such a Party for Liquidators, against whom forces
were being rallied. Obviously, there could be no room in the Party
for people who had made up their minds beforehand that they would
not abide by the Party decisions. With some comrades, however, the
struggle for the Party assumed the form of conciliation; they lost
sight of the aim of unity and relapsed into a man-of-the-street
striving to unite all and everyone, no matter what they stood
for. Even Innokenty, who fully subscribed to Ilyich's opinion that
the main thing was to unite with the pro-Party-Mensheviks, the
Plekhanovites, was so keen to preserve the Party that he began
himself to incline towards a conciliatory attitude. Ilyich set him
right, however.</P>
<p>
On the whole the resolutions were passed unanimously. It is
absurd to believe that Ilyich was voted down by the conciliators
and gave ground. The plenary meeting lasted three weeks. Ilyich
believed that the utmost concession should be made on
organizational issues without yielding an inch of ground on
fundamental issues. The organ of the Bolshevik
group &#8211; <EM>Proletary</EM> &#8211; was closed down. The remaining
500-ruble notes were burnt. The funds of the Bolshevik group were
handed over to three trustees &#8211; Kautsky, Mehring and Clara
Zetkin &#8211; to be issued by them only for general Party needs. In the
event of a split, the money left over was to be refunded to the
Bolsheviks. Kamenev was sent to Vienna where he was to represent
the Bolsheviks on the Trotskyist <EM>Pravda.</EM> "Things have
been very 'stormy' here recently, but the end of it was an attempt
to make peace with the Mensheviks," Vladimir Ilyich wrote to his
sister Anna Ilyinichna. "Yes, strange as it may seem, the organ of
our group has been closed down and we are trying to make a
stronger move towards unity."</P>
<p>
Innokenty and Nogin went to Russia to organize a collegium of
the Central Committee on the spot. Nogin was a conciliator who was
out to unite all and everyone, and his speeches met with a rebuff
on the part of the Bolsheviks. Innokenty took a different line,
but Russia was not abroad, where every word was common
property. His words were interpreted Nogin's way &#8211; the
non-Bolsheviks saw to that all right. Lindov and V. P. Milyutin
were co-opted on the Central Committee. Innokenty was soon
arrested. Lindov supported Nogin's point of view and was not very
active. Things were in a bad way with a Russian C.C. in 1910.</P>
<p>
They were not much better abroad either. Mark (Lyubimov)
and Lyova (Vladimirov) were "conciliators in general" and very
often took for granted the stories that were retailed about the
Bolsheviks being prone to squabbling and disloyalty. Mark,
particularly, heard many of these stories, as he was a member of
the united Bureau of the Central Committee Abroad, at which all
groups were represented.</P>
<P>The <EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists continued to organize. Alexinsky's
group once broke into a meeting of the Bolshevik group, who had
gathered in a cafe in Avenue d'Orleans. Alexinsky sat down at
the table with an insolent air and demanded to be given the
floor. When this was refused he gave a whistle and the
<EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists who had come with him attacked our
comrades. Two members of our group, Abram Skovno and Isaac Krivoi,
were about to hurl themselves into the fray, but Nikolai Sapozhkov
(Kuznetsov), a man of tremendous physical strength, snatched Abram
up under one arm and Isaac under the other, while the proprietor
of the cafe, an experienced man in the matter of brawls, turned
off the lights. The fight was thus nipped in the bud. But Ilyich
roamed the streets of Paris almost all night after that, and when
he came home he could not fall asleep.</P>
<P>"So there you are", Ilyich wrote in a letter to Gorky dated
April 11, 1910, the 'anecdotic' is the dominant note in the unity
at the present moment, it is pushed into the forefront, it evokes
jeers, and giggles, etc.</P>
<P>Living in the midst of this 'anecdotic' situation, amidst these
squabbles and scandals, this hell and ugly scum is sickening. To
watch it all is sickening too. But one must not be influenced by
one's moods. Emigrant life now is a hundred times worse than it
was before the revolution. Emigrant life and squabbling are
inseparable.</P>
<p>
"But the squabbling can be dismissed &#8211; nine-tenths of it takes
place abroad; squabbling is a minor detail. The thing is that the
Party, the Social-Democratic movement are developing and going
forward in face of all hellish difficulties of the present
situation. The purging of the Social-Democratic Party of its
dangerous 'deviations." Liquidationism and Otzovism is going
ahead unswervingly, and within the framework of unity it has moved
ahead far more than before." </P>
<P>Further, he writes, "I can imagine how hard it must be to watch
this painful growth of the new Social-Democratic movement for
those who have not seen or experienced the painful growth at the
end of the eighties and the beginning of the nineties. At that
time such Social-Democrats could be counted in dozens if not in
units, whereas now there are hundreds and thousands of them. Hence
the crisis and crises. And Social-Democracy as a whole is
weathering these crises openly and honestly." </P>
<p>
The squabbling roused in one a desire to get away from it
all. Lozovsky, for example, gave himself up entirely to the French
trade-union movement. We, too, felt drawn closer to the French
movement. We thought this would be made easier by our living in
the French Party colony. It was situated on the seashore near the
village of Pornic in the famous Vendee. I first went there with my
mother. But our life in the colony was not a success. The French
there kept to themselves, each family holding aloof from the
others, while the attitude to us Russians was not at all friendly,
especially on the part of the manageress of the colony. I became
rather friendly with a French teacher. There were hardly any
workers there. Presently the Kostitsins and S
Savvushka &#8211; <EM>Vperyod-</EM>ists arrived, and the first thing they
did was to have a row with the manageress. We then all decided to
move to Pornic and board together. Mother and I rented two small
rooms in the house of the customs caretaker. Soon Ilyich
arrived. He went sea bathing a lot, cycled a good deal &#8211; he loved
the sea and the sea breezes &#8211; chatted gaily with the Kostitsins
on everything under the sun, and enjoyed eating the crabs which
our landlord caught for us. He took a great liking to him and his
wife. The landlady, a stout loud-voiced laundress, told us about
the war she waged with the Catholic priests. She had a boy who
went to the secular school, and the youngster being an
excellent scholar, a bright and clever boy, the priests kept
urging her to send him to the monastery to be educated and
promised to pay her an allowance. The laundress indignantly
related how she had turned the Catholic priest out of the
house. She had not brought a son into the world, she said, in
order to make a contemptible Jesuit out of him. Ilyich praised the
crabs all the more highly.</P>
<p>
Ilyich arrived at Pornic on August 1, and the 26th found him
already in Copenhagen where he had gone to attend the meeting of
the International Socialist Bureau and the International
Congress. Describing the work of the congress Ilyich wrote:
"Differences with the revisionists are looming, but the
revisionists are still a long way from coming out with any
programme of their own. The fight with revisionism has been
postponed, but the fight is inevitable." </P>
<P>The Russian delegation at the congress was a fairly large
one &#8211; twenty in all, of whom ten were from the Social-Democrats,
seven from the Socialist-Revolutionaries and three from the trade
unions. The Social-Democratic group was represented by all
trends &#8211; Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Plekhanov, Warski, Martov
and Martynov; Trotsky, Lunacharsky and Kollontai had
deliberative votes. There were numerous guests at the congress. A
conference was held during the congress in which Lenin, Plekhanov,
Zinoviev, Kamenev and members of the Third Duma Poletayev and
I. P. Pokrovsky took part. It was decided at this conference to
publish abroad a popular newspaper <EM>Rabochaya Gazeta
(Workers' Newspaper)</EM>. Plekhanov played the diplomat, but
nevertheless wrote an article for the first number of the paper,
entitled "Our Position."</P>
<p>
After the Copenhagen Congress Ilyich went to Stockholm to see
his mother and sister Maria Ilyinichna. He was there ten
days. This was the last time he was to see his mother. He had a
premonition of it, and it was with sad eyes that he watched the
departing steamer. When he returned to Russia seven years
later &#8211; in 1917 &#8211; she was already dead.</P>
<p>
Ilyich related on his return to Paris that he had
managed to have a good talk with Lunacharsky. Ilyich always had a
weak spot for Lunacharsky. He was charmed by the man's gifted
nature. However, an article by Lunacharsky appeared soon
afterwards in <EM>Le Peuple</EM> entitled "Tactical Trends in Our
Party," in which all issues were dealt with from the Otzovist
standpoint. Ilyich read it and said nothing, but he retorted with
an article of his own. Others who attended the congress
commented on it too. Trotsky anonymously wrote an article in
<EM>Vorw&auml;rts</EM> in connection with the congress in which
he attacked the Bolsheviks and praised his own Vienna
<EM>Pravda.</EM> Congress delegates Plekhanov, Lenin and Warski
protested against the publication of this article in
<EM>Vorw&auml;rts</EM>. Plekhanov was hostile towards Trotsky as
far back as 1903, when Trotsky first made his appearance abroad
before the Second Congress. They had had an angry argument on the
question of a popular newspaper then. At the Copenhagen Congress
Plekhanov signed the protest against Trotsky's article without
reservation. Trotsky retaliated with a campaign against
<EM>Rabochaya Gazeta,</EM> which the Bolsheviks had started to
publish, declaring it to be a narrow factional organ. He also
addressed a meeting on the subject at the Vienna club. Kamenev, by
way of protest, resigned from the editorial board of the
Trotskyist <EM>Pravda,</EM> to which he had been sent to work
after the January Plenary Meeting. Influenced by Trotsky, the
Paris conciliators headed by Mark raised a campaign, too, against
<EM>Rabochaya Gazeta,</EM> fearing factionalism. Ilyich simply
could not stand this diffuse, unprincipled conciliationism,
conciliationism with anyone and everyone, which was tantamount to
surrendering one's positions at the height of the struggle.</P>
<p>
No. 50 of <EM>Neue Zeit</EM> for 1910 carried an article by
Trotsky entitled "Tendencies in the Development of Russian
Social-Democracy," and No. 51 an article by Martov "Prussian
Discussion and Russian Experience." Lenin replied with an article
"The Historical Meaning of the Internal Party Struggle in Russia,"
but the editors of <EM>Neue Zeit</EM> &#8211; Kautsky and Wurm, refused
to publish it. Marchlewski (Karsky) replied to Trotsky and Martov
after consulting Vladimir Ilyich by letter.</P>
<p>
In 1911 Comrade Kamo arrived in Paris. He had been arrested in
Berlin early in 1908 while carrying a valise with dynamite. He had
been kept in a German prison for over a year and a half, where he
had feigned madness. In October 1909 he was deported to Russia and
kept in prison there for another sixteen months in the Metekh
fortress in Tiflis. He was certified to be hopelessly insane and
transferred to the Mikhailovsky mental hospital, whence he
escaped, then came to France on board a ship as a stowaway, and
arrived in Paris to have a talk with Ilyich. He was very
distressed to hear that a rupture had occurred between Ilyich
and Bogdanov and Krasin. He was greatly attached to all
three. Besides, he was unable to grasp the situation that had
developed during the years he had spent in prison. Ilyich told
him how things stood.</P>
<P>Kamo asked me to buy him some almonds. He sat in our Paris
kitchen eating almonds, as if in his native Georgia, and telling
us about his arrest in Berlin, about the way he had simulated
insanity, about the sparrow he had tamed in prison, etc. Listening
to his stories, Ilyich felt extremely sorry for that brave,
devoted, childishly naive man with the warm heart, who was so
eager to perform deeds of valeur, but who now did not know what to
turn his hand to. His schemes were fantastic. Ilyich did not argue
with him, but tried delicately to bring him back to earth with
suggestions about organizing the transportation of literature and
so forth. In the end it was decided that Kamo was to go to
Belgium, have an operation on his eyes there (he was cross-eyed,
and this always gave him away to the police spies), and then make
his way south to Russia and the Caucasus. Ilyich examined Kamo's
coat and said: "Haven't you got a warm coat? You'll be cold in
this, walking about on deck." Ilyich himself always promenaded the
deck incessantly when travelling by boat. Hearing that Kamo had no
other coat, Ilyich got out the soft grey cloak which his mother
had given him as a present in Stockholm and of which he was very
fond, and gave it to Kamo. His talk with Ilyich, and the latter's
kindness, somewhat soothed Kamo. Afterwards, during the period of
Civil War, Kamo was back in his own element again, and displayed
miracles of heroism. True, with the passing over to the New
Economic Policy, he was off the rails again and kept talking about
wanting to go and study, while all the time he dreamt of
derring-do. He was killed during Ilyich's last illness. He was
cycling downhill in Tiflis and ran into a motor-car.</P>
<p>
Inessa Armand arrived in Paris from Brussels in 1910 and
immediately became an active member of our Paris group. Together
with Semashko and Britman (Kazakov) she was elected to the
presidium of the group and started an extensive correspondence
with the other groups abroad. She had a family of two little girls
and a boy. She was a hot Bolshevik, and before long our whole
Paris crowd had gathered round her.</P>
<P>Our Paris group, as a matter of fact, was steadily gaining
strength. It was becoming ideologically welded too. The trouble
was that many of us were hard up. The workers managed somehow to
make a living, but the intellectuals were in dire straits. They
could not always become workers. To live at the expense of the
political emigrants' benefit fund and emigrants' restaurant was
humiliating in the extreme. I remember several sad cases. One
comrade became a furniture polisher, but it was a long time before
he learned the job, and he had to change his place of work. He
lived in a working-class district, far away from where the other
emigrants lived. He got so weak from lack of food that he could
not get up from his bed, and he wrote a note, requesting money,
and asking that it should not be brought directly to him but left
with the concierge.</P>
<p>
Nikolai Sapozhkov (Kuznetsov) had a hard time too. He and his
wife got a job painting pottery, but they earned very little at
it. It was painful to see the ravages of starvation gradually
showing on the face of this once healthy giant of a man, who
never, by the way, complained about his circumstances. There were
many such cases. The saddest of all was that of Comrade Prigara, a
participant of the Moscow uprising. He lived somewhere in a
working-class suburb, and the comrades knew little about him. One
day he came to us in a very excitable state and began talking a
lot of nonsense without a stop &#8211; something about chariots full of
corn sheaves with a beautiful girl standing in one of
them. Clearly, the man had gone mad. It struck us at once as being
the result of starvation. Mother began hastily to prepare
something to eat for him. Ilyich, white with emotion, sat with him
while I ran off to fetch a psychiatrist, an acquaintance of
ours. The doctor came, had a talk with the patient, then said it
was a serious case of insanity as a result of starvation. He was
not so bad just now, but when it developed into a persecution
mania the patient was likely to commit suicide. He would have to
be watched. We did not know his address even. Britman went to see
him home, but on the way Prigara gave him the slip. Our whole
group searched for him, but could not find him. Later his body was
found in the Seine with stones tied to his neck and feet. He
had committed suicide after all.</P>
<P>
Another year or two of life in this atmosphere of squabbling and emigrant tragedy would have meant heading for a breakdown. But the years of reaction were followed by years of upsurge.</P>
<p>
The death of L. Tolstoi sparked off demonstrations in
Russia. The first issue of <EM>Zvezda (The Star)</EM> was
published. In Moscow the Bolshevik <EM>Mysl (Thought)</EM>
began to appear. Ilyich picked up at once. His article "The
Beginning of the Demonstrations," written on December 31, 1910, is
full of an inexhaustible buoyancy and vigour. It ends with the
appeal: "To work, comrades! Begin everywhere to build up your
organizations, to set up and strengthen Social-Democratic Party
workers units, develop economic and political agitation. In the
first Russian revolution the proletariat taught the masses to
fight for liberty; in the second revolution it will lead them to
victory!" </P>
