The October Days</h1>
<hr class="end">
<BR>
<p>
The seizure of power in October had been carefully thought out
and prepared by the Party of the proletariat&#8211;the Bolshevik
Party. The uprising during the July days had started
spontaneously, but the Party, keeping a sober mind, had
considered it premature. The truth had to be faced, and that
truth was that the masses were still unprepared for an
uprising. The Central Committee therefore decided to postpone
it. It was no easy thing to restrain the insurgents whose
fighting blood was up. But the Bolsheviks did their duty,
painful though it was, for they appreciated the vital importance
of choosing the right moment for the insurrection.</p><p>
A couple of months later the situation had changed, and Ilyich,
who was compelled to hide in Finland, wrote a letter to the
Central Committee and to the Petrograd and Moscow committees
between the 12th and 14th September, in which he said: "Having
obtained a majority in the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers'
Deputies in both capitals, the Bolsheviks can and must take
power into their hands." He then proceeds to show why the power
had to be seized precisely at that of all times. The surrender
of Petrograd would lessen the chances of success. There was talk
of a separate peace between the British and German
imperialists. "To offer peace to the nations precisely now is to
win," wrote Ilyich.</p><p>
In his letter to the Central Committee he deals at length with
the question of how to determine the moment for the insurrection
and how to prepare it. "To be successful, insurrection must rely
not upon conspiracy and not upon a party, but upon the advanced
class. That is the first point. Insurrection must rely upon a
<em>revolutionary upsurge of the people.</em> That is the second
point. Insurrection must rely upon such a <em>crucial
moment</em> in the history of the growing revolution when the
activity of the advanced ranks of the people is at its height,
and when the <em>vacillations </em>in the ranks of the enemy and
<em>in the ranks of the weak, half-hearted and irresolute
friends of the revolution</em> are strongest. That is the third
point."</p><p>
At the end of his letter Ilyich indicated what had to be done in
order to treat the insurrection in a Marxist way, i.e., as an
art. "And in order to treat insurrection in a Marxist way, i.e.,
as an art, we must at the same time, without losing a single
moment, organize a <em>headquarter staff </em>of the insurgent
detachments, distribute our forces, move the reliable regiments
to the most important points, surround the Alexandrinsky
Theatre," occupy the Peter and Paul Fortress, arrest the general
staff and the government, and move against the cadets and the
Savage Division such detachments as will rather die than allow
the enemy to approach the centres of the city, we must mobilize
the armed workers and call them to fight the last desperate
fight, occupy the telegraph and the telephone exchange at once,
place <em>our</em> headquarter staff of the insurrection at the
central telephone exchange and connect it by telephone with all
the factories, all the regiments, all the points of armed
fighting, etc.</p><p>
"Of course, this is all by way of example, only to illustrate
the fact that at the present moment it is impossible to remain
loyal to Marxism, to remain loyal to the revolution, <em>without
	treating insurrection as an art."</em> (Works, Vol.26, pp. 4,
8-9.)</p><p>
Living in Finland, removed from the actual scene, Ilyich was
terribly worried lest the opportune moment for the insurrection
should be missed. On October 7 he wrote to the Petrograd City
Conference, as well as to the Central Committee, the Moscow
Committee the Petrograd Committee and the Bolshevik members of
the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets. On the 8th he wrote a letter
to the Bolshevik delegates to the Congress of Soviets of the
Northern Region, and worried about whether his letter would
reach them. On the 9th he came to Petrograd himself and put up
illegally in the Vyborg District, whence he directed
preparations for the insurrection.</p><p>
That last month Ilyich thought of nothing else, lived for
nothing else but the insurrection. His mood and his deep
conviction communicated themselves to his comrades.</p><p>
His last letter from Finland to the Bolshevik delegates to the
Congress of Soviets of the Northern Region is a document of the
utmost importance. Here it is":</p><p>
"...Armed insurrection is a <em>special</em> form of political
struggle, one subject to special laws which must be attentively
pondered over. Karl Marx expressed this truth with remarkable
saliency when he wrote that armed <em>'insurrection is an art
quite as much as war.'</em></p><p>
"Of the principal rules of this art, Marx noted the following:</p><p>
"1) Never <em>play</em> with insurrection, but when beginning it
firmly realize that you must <em>go to the end.</em></p><p>
"2) Concentrate a <em>great superiority of forces </em>at the
decisive point, at the decisive moment, otherwise the enemy,
who has the advantage of better preparation and organization,
will destroy the insurgents.</p><p>
"3) Once the insurrection has begun, you must act with the
greatest <em>determination,</em> and by all means, without
fail, take the offensive. The defensive is the death of every
armed rising.'</p><p>
"4) You must try to take the enemy by surprise and seize the
moment when his forces are scattered.</p><p>
"5) You must strive for<em> daily</em> successes, even if small
(one might say hourly, if it is the case of one town), and at
all costs retain the <em>'moral ascendancy.'</em></p><p>
"Marx summed up the lessons of all revolutions in respect to
armed insurrection in the words of 'Danton, the greatest master
of revolutionary policy yet known: <em>de l'audace, de l'audace,
encore de l'audace.</em></p><p>
"Applied to Russia and to October 1917, this means: a
simultaneous offensive on Petrograd, as sudden and as rapid as
possible, which must without fail be carried out from within and
front without, from the working-class quarters and from Finland,
from Revel and from Kronstadt, an offensive of the
<em>whole</em> fleet, the concentration of a <em>gigantic
superiority</em> of forces over the 15,000 or 20,000 (perhaps
more) of our 'bourgeois guard' (the officers schools), our
'Vendean troops' (part of the Cossacks), etc.</p><p>
"Our <em>three</em> main forces&#8211;the navy, the workers and
the army units&#8211;must be so combined as to occupy without
fail and to hold <em>at the cost of any sacrifice:</em> a) the
telephone exchange; b) the telegraph office; c) the railway
stations; d) above all, the bridges.</p><p>
"The most <em>determined</em> elements (our "shock forces" and
<em>young workers,</em> as well as the best of the sailors) must
be formed into small detachments to occupy all the more
important points and to <em>take part</em> everywhere in all
important operations, for example:</p><p>
"To encircle and cut off Petrograd; to seize it by combined
attack of the navy, the workers, and the troops&#8211;a task
which requires <em>art and triple audacity.</em></p><p>
"To form detachments composed of the best workers, armed with
rifles and bombs, for the purpose of attacking and surrounding
the enemy's 'centres' (the military cadets' schools, the
telegraph office, the telephone exchange, etc.). Their watchword
must be: <em>'Rather perish to man than let the enemy
	pass!'</em></p><p>
"Let us hope that if action is decided on, the leaders will
successfully apply the great precepts of Danton and Marx.</p><p>
"The success of both the Russian and the world revolution
depends on two or three days of fighting." (Works, Vol. 26,
pp. 151-53.)</p><p>
This letter was written on the 21st, and the 22nd already found
Ilyich in Petrograd. The next day there was a meeting of the
Central Committee, at which a resolution was carried on his
motion calling for an armed uprising. Zinoviev and Kamenev voted
against it and demanded that a special plenary meeting of the
Central Committee should be called. Kamenev demonstratively
announced his resignation from the Central Committee. Lenin
demanded that the severest measures of Party penalty should be
imposed upon them.</p><p>
Intensive preparations for the uprising were going forward and
breaking down all opportunist resistance. On October 26 the
Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet passed a resolution
to set up a Military Revolutionary Committee. On October 29 an
enlarged meeting of the Central Committee was held together with
representatives of the Party organizations. The same day, at a
meeting of the Central Committee, a Military Revolutionary
Centre was set up to direct the uprising, consisting of Stalin,
Sverdlov, Dzerzhinsky and others.</p><p>
On the 30th the proposed organization of a Military
Revolutionary Committee was endorsed by the Petrograd Soviet as
a whole and not only its Executive Committee. Five days after
this a meeting of the regimental committees acknowledged the
Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee as the leading organ
of the military units in Petrograd, and passed a resolution not
to obey the orders of the Staff unless they were endorsed by the
Military Revolutionary Committee.</p><p>
Already on November 5 the Military Revolutionary Committee had
appointed commissars to the military units. The next day,
November 6, the Provisional Government decided to prosecute the
members of the M.R.C., and arrest the commissars appointed to
the military units. The military cadets were called out to the
Winter Palace. But it was too late. The military units stood for
the Bolsheviks. The workers stood for the transfer of power to
the Soviets. The M.R.C. was working under the direct
guidance of the Central Committee, most of whose members,
including Stalin, Sverdlov, Molotov, Dzerzhinsky and Bubnov,
were members of the M.R.C. The uprising had begun.</p><p>
On November 6 Ilyich was still in hiding at the flat of our
Party member Marguerite Fofanova in the Vyborg District (House
No. 92/1, Flat No. 42 on the corner of Bolshoi Sampsonievsky and
Serdobolskaya streets). He knew that the uprising was about to
take place, and fretted because he was not in the thick of it at
such a crucial moment. He sent two messages through Marguerite
saying that the uprising could not be delayed a moment
more. That evening, at last, Eino Rahja, a Finnish comrade, came
to see him. Eino, who was in close touch with the factories and
the Party organization and served as a medium through whom
Ilyich maintained contact with the organization, told Ilyich
that the guards patrolling the city had been doubled, that the
Provisional Government had given orders to raise the bridges
across the Neva in order to cut off communication between the
working-class quarters, and that the bridges were being guarded
by detachments of soldiers. Obviously, the uprising was
starting. Ilyich had intended asking Eino to send for Stalin,
but had gathered from what Eino had told him that that was
almost impossible. Stalin was probably at the M.R.C. in Smolny,
the tramcars were probably not running, and it would take him a
long time to get there. Ilyich decided to go to Smolny himself
at once. He hurried away, leaving Marguerite a note, saying: "I
am going where you did not want me to go.
Good-bye. Ilyich."</p><p>
That night the Vyborg District was arming in preparation for the
uprising. One group of workers after another came to the
District Committee to receive weapons and instructions. That
night I went to see Ilyich at Fofanova's flat, only to learn
that he had gone to Smolny. Zhenya Yegorova (Secretary of the
Vyborg District Party Committee) and I tacked on to a lorry that
our people were sending to Smolny. I was anxious to know whether
Ilyich had reached Smolny in safety or not. I do not remember
now whether I actually saw Ilyich in Smolny or only learned that
he was there. At any rate, I know I did not talk to him, because
he was completely absorbed in the business of directing the
uprising, and when he did a thing he never did it by
halves.</p><p>
Smolny was brilliantly lit up, a scene of intense activity. Red
Guards, representatives from the factories, and soldiers came
from all over to receive instructions. Typewriters rattled away,
telephones rang, our girls sat sorting out piles of telegrams,
and on the second floor the M.R.C. was in continuous
session. Armoured cars stood throbbing on the square outside, a
held gun stood ready for action, and stacks of firewood had been
built up in case barricades were needed. Guns and machine-guns
stood at the entrance, sentries at the doors.</p><p>
By 10 a.m. on October 25 (November 7, New Style), a manifesto
"To the Citizens of Russia" issued by the M.R.C. of the
Petrograd Soviet came off the press. It said:</p><p>
"The Provisional Government has been overthrown. The power of
state has passed into the hands of the organ of the Petrograd
Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies,
the Military Revolutionary Committee, which stands at the head of the Petrograd proletariat and garrison.</p><p>
"The cause for which the people have fought&#8211;the immediate
proposal of a democratic peace, the abolition of landlord
ownership of the land, workers' control over production and the
creation of a Soviet Government&#8211;is assured.</p><p>
"Long live the revolution of the workers, soldiers and peasants!" (Works, Vol. 26, p. 207.)</p><p>
Although it was obvious that the revolution was victorious, the
M.R.C. continued its activities as intensively as ever,
occupying the government offices one after another, organizing
guard duty, etc.</p><p>
At 2.30 p.m. a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and
Soldiers' Deputies was held. The Soviet hailed with acclamation
the report that the Provisional Government no longer existed,
that some of its ministers had been arrested and the rest were
awaiting their turn, that the Pre-parliament had been dismissed,
and the railway stations, the general post and telegraph offices
and the State Bank occupied. The Winter Palace was being
stormed. It had not been captured yet, but its fate was sealed,
and the soldiers were displaying wonderful heroism. The
uprising had been a bloodless one.</p><p>
Lenin's appearance at the meeting of the Soviet was greeted with
a tumultuous ovation. It was characteristic of Ilyich that he
made no big speeches in connection with the victory. He spoke
instead about the tasks confronting the Soviet power, which had
to be tackled in real earnest. He said that a new period in the
history of Russia had been ushered in. The Soviet Government
would carry on without the bourgeoisie. A decree would be issued
abolishing private ownership of the land. A real workers'
control would be established over industry. The struggle for
socialism would be launched. The old machinery of state would be
broken up and scrapped, and a new authority, the authority of
the Soviet organizations, would be set up. We had the force of a
mass organization which would carry all before it. The task of
the day was to conclude peace. To do that Capital had to be
defeated. The international proletariat, among whom signs of
revolutionary unrest were beginning to appear, would help us to
secure
peace.</p><p>This speech struck home with the members of the
Petrograd Soviet of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies. Yes, a new
period in our history was beginning. The strength of the mass
organizations was invincible. The masses had risen, and the
power of the bourgeoisie had fallen. We shall take the land
from the landowners, and give the law to the factory owners,
and, most important of all, we shall secure peace. The world
revolution will come to our assistance. Ilyich was right. His
speech was greeted with a storm of applause.</p><p>
The Second Congress of the Soviets was to be opened that
evening. It was to proclaim the power of the Soviets and give
official recognition to the victory of the revolution.</p><p>
Agitation was carried on among the delegates when they began to
arrive. The government of the workers was to lean upon the
peasantry, rally it behind them. The party that was supposed to
express the views of the peasantry were the
Socialist-Revolutionaries. The rich peasantry, the kulaks
had their ideologists in the person of the Right
Socialist-Revolutionaries. The ideologists of the peasant
masses, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were typical
representatives of the petty bourgeoisie, which wavered between
the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The leaders of the
Petrograd Committee of the Socialist-Revolutionaries were
Natanson, Spiridonova and Kamkov. Ilyich had met Natanson during
his first emigration. At that time&#8211;in 1904&#8211;Natanson
had stood fairly close to the Marxists, except that he had
believed the Social-Democrats to be underestimating the role of
the peasantry. Spiridonova was a popular figure at that
time. During the first revolution, in 1906, she, then a girl of
seventeen, had assassinated Luzhenovsky, the suppressor of the
peasant movement in the Tambov Gubernia. After being brutally
tortured, she was condemned to penal servitude in Siberia, where
she remained until the February Revolution. The Left
Socialist-ReVolutionaries of Petrograd were strongly influenced
by the Bolshevik temper of the masses. They were more favourably
inclined towards the Bolsheviks than any of the others. They saw
that the Bolsheviks were out in all earnest to confiscate all
the lands of the landowners and hand them over to the
peasants. The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries believed in
introducing a system of equalized land-tenure; the Bolsheviks
realized that a complete reconstruction of agriculture on
socialist lines was necessary. However, Ilyich considered that
the most important thing at the moment was to confiscate the
landowners' lands. As to what turn further reconstruction would
take, experience itself would show. And he gave his thoughts to
the drafting of a decree on the land.</p><p>
The reminiscences of M. V. Fofanova contain a very interesting
item. "I remember," she writes, "Vladimir Ilyich asking me to
get him all the back numbers of <em>Izvestia,</em> the organ of
the All-Russian Soviet of Peasants' Deputies, which I did, of
course. I do not remember exactly how many numbers there were,
but they made a solid batch of material for study. Vladimir
Ilyich spent two days over it, working even at night. In the
morning he says to me: 'Well, I think I've studied these
S.-R.'s inside out. All that remains is for me to read the
mandate of their peasant electors.' Two hours later he called me
in and said cheerfully, slapping one of the newspapers (I saw it
to be the August 19 issue of the <em>Peasant Izvestia)</em>:
'Here's a ready-made agreement with the Left S.-R.'s. It's no
joke&#8211;this mandate has been signed by 242 local deputies. We
shall use it as the basis for our law concerning the land and
see if the Left S.-R.'s dare to reject it.' He showed me the
paper with blue pencil markings all over it and added: 'The
thing is to find a means by which we could afterwards reshape
their socialization idea after our own pattern.' "</p><p>
Marguerite was an agronomist by profession and she came up
against these problems in her work. It was, therefore, a subject
on which Ilyich willingly spoke to her.</p><p>
Would the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries quit the congress or not?</p><p>
The Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets opened at 10.45
p.m. on October 25 (November 7, New Style). That evening the
congress was to be constituted, was to elect a presidium and
define its powers. Of the 670 delegates only 300 were
Bolsheviks; 193 were Socialist-Revolutionaries and 68
Mensheviks. The Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and
Bundists foamed at the mouth and thundered denunciations at the
Bolsheviks. They read out a declaration of protest against the
"military plot and seizure of power engineered by the Bolsheviks
behind the backs of the other parties and factions represented
on the Soviet" and walked out. Some of the
Menshevik-Internationalists quitted too. The Left
Socialist-Revolutionaries, who formed the overwhelming majority
of the S.-R. delegates (169 out of 193), remained. Altogether
fifty delegates quitted the congress. Vladimir Ilyich was not
present at the opening night.</p><p>
While the Second Congress of Soviets was being opened the Winter
Palace was being stormed. Kerensky had escaped the day before,
disguised as a sailor, and was rushed off to Pskov in a
motor-car. The Military Revolutionary Committee of Pskov did not
arrest him, although it had direct orders signed by Dybenko and
Krylenko to do so, and Kerensky left for Moscow to organize a
crusade against Petrograd, where the soldiers and workers had
taken the power into their own hands. The other ministers,
headed by Kishkin, entrenched themselves in the Winter Palace
under the protection of the military cadets and the women's
shock battalion, which had been drawn up there for the
purpose. The Mensheviks, Right S.-R.'s and Bundists were frantic
with rage over the siege of the Winter Palace and went into
hysterics at the congress. Erlich declared that some of the
town-councillors had decided to go unarmed to the Palace Square
and risk being shot down because the palace was being
shelled. The Executive Committee of the Soviet of Peasants
Deputies, and the Menshevik and S.-R. groups decided to join
them. After the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries had
walked out an interval was called. When the proceedings were
resumed at 3.10 a.m. the congress was informed that the Winter
Palace had been taken, the ministers arrested, the officers and
cadets disarmed, and the Third Bicycle Battalion, which Kerensky
had sent against Petrograd, had gone over to the revolutionary
people.</p><p>
When there was no doubt left that victory had been won and that
the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries would not quit the congress,
Vladimir Ilyich, who had hardly slept the previous night and had
taken an active part all the time in directing the uprising,
left Smolny and went to sleep at the Bonch-Bruyeviches', who
lived in Peski, not far from Smolny. He was given a room to
himself, but he could not fall asleep for a long time. He got up
quietly so as not to wake anybody and began to write the Decree
on Land, which he had already thought out in every
detail.</p><p>
Addressing the congress on the evening of October
26 (November 8, New Style) in support of the Decree on Land,
Ilyich said:</p><p>
"Voices are being raised here that the decree itself and the
mandate were drawn up by the Socialist-Revolutionaries. What of
it? Does it matter who drew them up? As a democratic government,
we cannot ignore the decision of the rank and file of the
people, even though we may disagree with it. In the fire of
experience, applying the decree in practice, and carrying it out
locally, the peasants will themselves realize where the truth
lies.... Life is the best teacher and it will show who is
right. Let the peasants solve this problem from one end and we
shall solve it from the other. Life will oblige us to draw
together in the general stream of revolutionary creative work,
in the elaboration of new state forms.... The peasants have
learnt something during the eight months of our revolution; they
want to settle all land questions themselves. We are therefore
opposed to all amendments to this draft law. We want no details
in it, for we are writing a decree, not a programme of action."
(Works, Vol. 26, pp. 228-29.) We have all of Ilyich in those
words&#8211;an Ilyich free from petty conceit (it does not matter
who said it, so long as it says the right thing), taking into
consideration the opinion of the rank and file, appreciating the
power of revolutionary creative work, clearly understanding that
the masses are best convinced by practice and experience, and
that the hard facts of life would show them that the Bolsheviks'
point of view had been correct. The Decree on Land submitted by
Lenin was adopted. Sixteen years have passed since
then. Landlord ownership has been abolished, and step by step,
in a struggle against the old proprietary habits and views, new
forms of farming have been created &#8211;collective farming,
which now embraces the bulk of peasant households. The old
small-farm methods and small-owner mentality are becoming a
thing of the past. A strong and powerful basis for socialist
farming has
been created.</p><p>
The decrees on Peace and Land were passed at the evening session
on October 26 (November 8). On these points agreement was
reached with the S.-R.'s. On the question of forming a
government, however, the position was worse. The Left S.-R.'s
had not quitted the congress because they had realized that such
an action would have cost them their influence among the peasant
masses, but the withdrawal on October 25 of the Right S.-R.'s
and the Mensheviks, and their outcries against the adventurism
of the Bolsheviks, the seizure of power, etc., etc., had
deeply affected them. After the Right S.-R.'s and the others had
left the congress, Kamkov, one of the leaders of the Left
S.-R.'s, declared that they stood for a united democratic
government, and that the Left S.-R.'s would do everything they
could to have such a government set up. The Left S.-R.'s said
they wanted to act as mediators between the Bolsheviks and the
parties who had left the congress. The Bolsheviks did not refuse
to negotiate, but Ilyich understood perfectly well that nothing
would come of such talks. The Bolsheviks had not seized the
power and made the revolution in order to hitch a swan, a pike
and a crab to the Soviet cart, to form a government that would
be incapable of pulling together and getting things
done. Cooperation with the Left S.-R.'s, in Ilyich's opinion,
was possible.</p><p>
A talk on this question with representatives of the Left S.-R.'s
was held a couple of hours before the congress opened on
October 26. I remember the surroundings in which that conference
was held. It was a room in Smolny with small settees upholstered
in dark red. On one settee sat Spiridonova, and next to her
stood Ilyich, arguing with her in a sort of gentle earnest
manner. No agreement was reached with the Left S.-R.'s. They did
not want to join the government. Ilyich proposed the appointment
of Bolsheviks alone to the posts of socialist ministers.</p><p>
The congress session of October 26 (November 8) opened at 9
p.m. I was present. I remember the speech Ilyich made in
submitting his draft Decree on Land. He spoke calmly. The
audience listened with rapt attention. During the reading of the
Decree I was struck by the expression of one of the delegates
who sat a little way off. He was an elderly looking peasant, and
under the stress of powerful emotion his face had assumed a
wax-like appearance and his eyes shone with a peculiar
light.</p><p>
The death sentence, introduced by Kerensky at the front, was
repealed, decrees on Peace, on Land and on Workers' Control were
passed, and a Bolshevik Council of People's Commissars was
formed as follows: Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin)&#8211;Chairman of the
Council; A. I. Rykov-People's Commissar for Internal Affairs;
V. P. Milyutin &#8211;Agriculture; A. G. Shyapnikov&#8211;Labour;
V. A. Ovseyenko (Antonov), N. V. Krylenko and
P. Y. Dybenko&#8211;Committee of Military and Naval Affairs;
V. P. Nogin&#8211;Trade and Industry;
A. V. Lunacharsky-Education; I. I. Skvortsov (Stepanov)
&#8211;Finance; L. D. Bronstein (Trotsky)&#8211;Foreign Affairs;
G. I. Oppokov (Lomov)&#8211;Justice; I. A. Teodorovich&#8211;Food
Supply; N. P. Avilov (Glebov)&#8211;Post and Telegraph; and
J. V. Djugashvili (Stalin)&#8211;Chairman of the People's
Commissariat for the Affairs of Nationalities. The post of
Commissar of Ways of Communication was left open.</p><p>
Eino Rahja relates that when the list of first People's
Commissars was being discussed at a meeting of the Bolshevik
group, he had been sitting in a corner listening. One of the
nominees had protested that he had no experience in that kind of
work. Vladimir Ilyich had burst out laughing and said: "Do you
think any of us has had such experience?" None had any
experience, of course. But Vladimir Ilyich envisaged the
People's Commissar as a new type of minister, an organizer and
manager of one or another branch of state activity, who was
linked closely with the masses.</p><p>
Vladimir Ilyich's mind was hard at work all the time on the
problem of new forms of administration. He was thinking of how
to organize a machinery of government that would be free from
the taint of bureaucratism, that would lean on the masses,
organize their cooperation and assistance, and show itself
capable of training a new type of administrative worker on this
job. In the resolution of the Second Congress of Soviets
concerning the formation of a workers' and peasants' government,
this is expressed in the following words:</p><p>
"The management of the different branches of state activity is
entrusted to commissions whose make-up should ensure the
implementation of the programme proclaimed by the congress in
close unity with the mass
organizations of the workers, sailors, soldiers, peasants and
employees. The government power is vested in a collegium of
chairmen of the said commissions, i.e., the Council of People's
Commissars." (Works, Vol. 26, p. 230.)</p><p>I recall the talks
I had with Ilyich on this subject during the few weeks he lived
at Fofanova's. I was working at the time with tremendous
enthusiasm in the Vyborg District, keenly observing the
revolutionary activities of the masses and the radical changes
that were taking place in the whole pattern of life. On meeting
Vladimir Ilyich I would tell him about life in the district. I
remember telling him about an interesting sitting of a People's
Court which I had attended. Such courts had been held in some
places during the Revolution of 1905&#8211;in Sormovo for one
thing. Chugurin, a worker, whom I had met as a student of the
Longjumeau Party school near Paris and with whom I was now
working at the Vyborg District Council, was a native of
Sormovo. It was his suggestion to start organizing such courts
in the Vyborg District. The first court sat at the People's
House. The place was packed with people standing shoulder to
shoulder on the floor, benches and window sills. I do not
remember now exactly what cases came before the court. They were
not really offences in the strict sense of the word, but
incidents of everyday life. Two suspicious characters were tried
for attempting to arrest Chugurin. A tall swarthy watchman was
"tried" for beating his young son, exploiting him and keeping
him away from school. Many working men and women from among the
public made warm speeches, The
"defendant" kept wiping the sweat from his brow, and then, with the tears streaming down his face, promised not to ill-treat his son any more. Strictly speaking, it was not a court, but a public control of citizens' behaviour; we were witnessing proletarian ethics in the making. Vladimir Ilyich was greatly interested in this "court" and questioned me about it in detail.</p><p>
Mostly I told him about the new forms of educational work. I was
in charge of the Department of Education at the District
Council. The children's school did not function in the summer,
and most of the time I was busy with political education. In
this respect my five years' experience at the Sunday Evening
School in the Nevskaya Zastava District in the nineties came in
very useful to me. These were different times, of course, and we
could go ahead with the job unhampered.</p><p>
Delegates from some forty factories got together every week and
we discussed ways and means of carrying out one or another
measure. Whatever we decided was immediately carried out. For
example, we decided to do away with illiteracy, and the factory
delegates, each at his own place of employment, organized the
registration of illiterates, secured school premises and
raised the necessary funds by bearing down upon the factory
managements. A representative of the workers was attached to
each such school and he saw to it that the school was supplied
with all that it needed in the way of blackboards, chalk, ABC
books, etc. Special representatives were appointed to see that
right teaching methods were used and to find out what the
workers had to say about it. We briefed these representatives
and had them report back to us. We got together delegates of
the soldiers' wives and discussed conditions in the children's
homes, organized their inspection over the children's homes,
gave them instructions, and carried out extensive explanatory
work among them. We got together the librarians of the district,
and together with them and the workers discussed the forms of
work of the public libraries. A powerful impulse was given to
the initiative of the workers, and the Department of Education
rallied around itself considerable forces. Ilyich said at the
time that this was just the style of work that our government
offices and future ministers would have to adopt, a style of
work modelled after these committees of working men and women,
who were in the thick of things and were familiar with the
conditions of life and work of the masses and with everything
that agitated their minds at the moment. Vladimir Ilyich was
all the more keen to draw me out on these subjects in that he
believed I understood how to enlist the masses on the job of
running the government. He had some strong things to say
afterwards about the "rotten" bureaucratism that had wormed its
way in everywhere. Eventually, when the question came up of
raising the responsibility of the People's Commissars and the
Commissariats' department managers, who often shuffled it off on
to the boards and commissions, the question of oneman management
arose. Ilyich unexpectedly got me appointed a member of the
commission under the Council of People's Commissars which was
set up to investigate this question. He said we must be careful
that one-man management should in no way override the initiative
and independent activity of the commissions, or weaken the ties
with the masses; one-man management had to be combined with an
ability to work with the masses. Ilyich tried to make use of
everyone's experience for building up a state of a new type. The
Soviet Government, at the head of which Ilyich now stood, was
faced with the task of setting up a type of state machinery such
as the world had never yet seen, a machinery that relied on the
support of the broad masses; the task was to remodel the whole
social fabric and all human relations along new socialist
lines.</p><p>
But first of all the Soviet power had to be defended against the
enemy's attempts to overthrow it by force and disrupt it from
within. Our ranks had to be strengthened.</p><p>
November 9-15 were days of struggle for the very existence of the Soviet power.</p><p>
As a result of a thorough study of the experience of the Paris
Commune, the world's first proletarian state, Ilyich noted what
a ruinous effect the lenity which the working masses and the
workers' government had shown towards their avowed enemies had
had upon the fate of the Paris Commune. In speaking of the fight
against the enemies, therefore, Ilyich was always inclined to
put the case strongly for fear of the masses and himself showing
too great lenity.</p><p>
At the beginning of the October Revolution there had been far
too much forbearance of this kind. Kerensky and a number of
ministers had been allowed to escape, the cadets who had
defended the Winter Palace had been set free on parole, and
General Krasnov, who commanded Kerensky's advancing troops, had
been left under domiciliary arrest. One day, while sitting in
one of the waiting rooms at Smolny on a heap of army coats, I
heard a conversation between Krylenko and General Krasnov, who
had been brought to Petrograd under arrest. They had come in
together, sat down at a small table standing all by itself in
the middle of the large room, and dropped into a calm easy
conversation. I remember being surprised at the peaceful nature
of their talk. Speaking at a meeting of the Central Executive
Committee on November 17, Ilyich had said: "Krasnov was treated
leniently. He was merely put under domiciliary arrest. We are
against civil war. But if, nevertheless, it continues, what are
we to do?" (Works, Vol. 26, p. 252.)</p><p>
Released by the Pskov comrades, Kerensky had
engineered an attack on Petrograd; set free on parole, the cadets had revolted on November 11, and Krasnov, escaping from under domiciliary arrest, had organized a hundred-thousand-strong White army in the Don with aid of the German Government.</p><p>
The people were tired of the imperialist carnage and wanted a
bloodless revolution, but the enemies compelled them to
fight. Engrossed completely in the problems of socialist
reconstruction of the entire social system, Ilyich was compelled
to turn his attention to the defence of the cause of the
revolution.</p><p>
On November 9 Kerensky succeeded in capturing Gatchina. In an
article "Lenin During the Days of the Uprising" <em>(Krasnaya
Gazeta,</em> November 6, 1927) Podvoisky gives a vivid
description of the tremendous work Lenin did during the days of
Petrograd's defence. He describes how Lenin came to the Area
Staff Headquarters and demanded a report on the
situation. Antonov Ovseyenko began to explain the general plan
of operations, pointing out on the map the disposition of our
forces and the probable disposition and strength of the enemy's
forces. "Lenin examined the map closely. With the keenness of a
profound and attentive strategist and general, he demanded
explanations&#8211;why this point was not being guarded, why that
point was undefended, why such a step was being contemplated
instead of another, why Kronstadt, Vyborg, Helsingfors had not
been called on for support, and so on. After comparing notes, it
became clear that we had really made quite a number of blunders
and not acted with the prompt urgency which the menacing
situation in Petrograd called for in the matter of organizing
the means and forces for its defence." </p><p>On the evening of
the 9th Ilyich spoke with Helsingfors on the private line and
arranged for two destroyers and the battleship
<em>Respublika</em> to be sent to guard the approaches to
Petrograd.</p><p>
Vladimir Ilyich went to the Putilov Works with
Antonov-Ovseyenko to check up whether the armoured train, which
was so badly needed, was being built quickly enough. He talked
with the workers there. Staff Headquarters was transferred to
Smolny, and Lenin took a close interest in all its work, and
helped it to mobilize the
activity of the masses. Podvoisky writes that he began to
appreciate Lenin's work after a delegate conference of workers'
organizations, district Soviets, factory committees, trade
unions and military units, which Lenin had called. "I saw here
wherein Lenin's power lay," he writes. "During an emergency, he
kept the concentration of our forces and means at its highest
pitch of intensity. We squandered our energies, mustered and
used our forces without plan, as a result of which our efforts
lost much of their impact, and blunted the edge of the masses'
activity, initiative and determination. The masses had not felt
that iron will and iron plan which keeps all parts together as
in a finely adjusted machine. Lenin kept driving home the idea
that it was essential to make the utmost concentrated efforts
for defence. Elaborating on this idea he unfolded to the
conference an intelligible plan in which, as in an integral
machine, everyone found a place for himself, for his factory
or his unit. Right there, at the conference, every man was able
to envisage concretely the plan of further work, and to feel his
work to be linked with that of the whole collective body of the
republic. As a result, he felt the responsibility which, from
that moment, the dictatorship of the proletariat was imposing
upon him. To attract the masses and bring it home to them that
no leaders would do their job for them, but that they themselves
would have to get down to work with their own hands if they
wanted to arrange their lives on new lines and defend their
state&#8211;this is what Lenin constantly strove to achieve,this
is where he showed himself to be a true leader of the people, a
leader who was able to make the masses face up to vital and
essential issues and take the step towards their solution
themselves, not by unconsciously following a leader, but by
being profoundly conscious themselves of what they were
doing."</p><p>
In this Podvoisky was absolutely right. Ilyich
was able to alert the masses, was able always to set concrete
aims
before them.</p><p>
The workers of Petrograd rose in defence of their city. Old and
young went off to the front to meet the troops of Kerensky. The
Cossacks and the units that had been called up from the
provinces were none too keen on fighting, and the Petrograd
workers carried on agitation among them, argued with
them. The Cossacks and soldiers whom Kerensky had mobilized
simply quitted the front, taking guns and rifles with
them. Kerensky's front was disintegrating. Nevertheless, many
Petrograd workers lost their lives in defending the city. Among
them was Vera Slutskaya, who had been an active Party worker in
the Vasileostrovsky District. She went out to the front in a
lorry and had her head blown off by a shell. Quite a number of
our Vyborg District comrades were killed too. The whole district
turned out to attend the funeral.</p><p>
On November 11, when Kerensky was marching on Petrograd in full
force, the military cadets, who had been released from the
Winter Palace on parole, decided to help Kerensky and engineered
a revolt. I was still living in Petrograd District at the time
with Ilyich's relatives&#8211;this was before I moved to
Smolny. Early in the morning fighting started near the
Pavlovskoye Military School not far from where we lived. On
hearing of the revolt of the cadets, the Red Guards and workers
from the factories in the Vyborg District came to suppress
it. Guns were used in the fighting, and our house shook. The
people around us were scared to death. Early in the morning of
that day, when I was leaving the house to go to the District
Council, a housemaid from next door had come running towards me
crying horrified: "You ought to see what they're doing! I just
saw them bayonet a cadet just like a fly on a pin!" On the way I
had met a fresh force of the Vyborg Red Guards coming up with
another cannon. The revolt of the cadets was quickly
suppressed.</p><p>
The same day Ilyich addressed a conference of regimental
representatives of the Petrograd garrison. In the course of his
speech he said: "Kerensky's attempt was as pitiful an adventure
as Kornilov's. It is a difficult moment, though. Energetic
measures are needed to improve the food supply and put an end to
the hardships of war. We cannot wait, and we cannot tolerate a
revolt of Kerensky's for a single day. If the Kornilovites
organize a new offensive they will get the same answer as the
cadet revolt received today. The cadets have themselves to
blame. We have taken the power almost without any bloodshed. If
there were any casualties they were on our side alone.... The
government created by the will of the workers', soldiers' and
peasants' deputies, will not tolerate any insults on the part of
the Kornilovites." (Works, Vol.
26, p. 236.)</p><p>
On November 14 Kerensky's revolt was suppressed. Gatchina was
recaptured. Kerensky escaped. In Petrograd victory was
complete. But in the country at large civil war was breaking
out. On November 8 General Kaledin had proclaimed martial law in
the Don Region and began to organize the Cossacks against the
Soviet power. On November 9 the Cossack ataman Dutov had
captured Orenburg. In Moscow things were dragging. The Whites
had seized the Kremlin there. The fight was fiercer than
in Petrograd.</p><p>
The Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Mensheviks and other
factions, who had quitted the Second Congress of Soviets on
November 8, organized a Committee for the Salvation of the
Motherland and the Revolution, around which they thought to
rally all the opponents of the Soviet power. The committee had
on it nine representatives of the Central Town Council, the
whole presidium of the Pre-parliament, three representatives
from each of the executive committees of the All-Russian Soviet
of Workers and Soldiers' Deputies, the Soviet of Peasants'
Deputies, and of the S.-R. and Menshevik factions,
representatives of the Unity-Mensheviks, the Centroflot and
two representatives of Plekhanov's Unity group. They were out to
save the country and the revolution from the Bolshevik
"adventurers" who had seized the power behind their backs. But
they could not do much. The slogans "For Peace," "For Land" were
so popular among the masses that the latter rallied
unhesitatingly around the Bolsheviks with tremendous
enthusiasm. The Committee of Public Security, which had been
formed in Moscow, joined the Petrograd Committee for the
Salvation of the Motherland and the Revolution. It had been
formed on the initiative of the Moscow Town Council, at the head
of which stood the Right Socialist-Revolutionary Rudnev. The
Moscow Committee of Public Security openly sided with the
counter-revolution.</p><p>
Troops had to be sent to Moscow to give a helping hand, but this
could not be done on account of the stand which the All-Russian
Executive Committee of Railway Employees had taken. The
Railwaymen's Executive backed the dissentient factions that had
quitted the congress, and the workers had no influence
there. The Railwaymen's Executive declared that it took a
"neutral stand" in the civil war that had started, and would not
allow the troops of either side to pass. Actually, this
"neutrality" hit the Bolsheviks and prevented them from sending
troops to the assistance of Moscow. The sabotage of the
Railwaymen's Executive was broken by the railway workers, who
undertook to transport the troops themselves. On November 16 the
Military Revolutionary Committee in Petrograd sent a force to
Moscow. The resistance of the Whites, however, was overcome in
Moscow before those troops arrived.</p><p>
At the most difficult moment, when the revolt of the military
cadets had only just been suppressed in Petrograd, when Kerensky
was still advancing, and fighting in Moscow was still in
progress, a number of members of the Party Central Committee
began to vacillate. They believed that concessions ought to be
made, that the situation was desperate. These vacillations were
most strikingly revealed in the negotiations with the
Railwaymen's Executive. On November 9, the latter passed a
resolution calling for the formation of a government of all the
Socialist parties, from the Bolsheviks to the Popular
Socialists, and offering to act as mediators. At first only the
Left wing of the Railwaymen's Executive entered into
negotiations with the Central Committee, who authorized
L. B. Ramenev and G. Y. Sokolnikov to represent it. The
Mensheviks and the Right S.-R.'s took no part in the talks at
first, but when they saw, as they thought, that the Bolsheviks
had been driven into a corner as a result of Kerensky's attack
and the state of affairs in Moscow, and learned that
vacillations had started within the Central Committee, they
became brazen to a degree. They came to the meeting of the
Railwaymen's Executive on November 12-13 and demanded the
repudiation of the power of the Soviets, the exclusion from
participation in the government of those guilty of the October
uprising, the removal, first and foremost, of Lenin, and the
setting up of a new government headed by Chernov or
Avksentyev. The Bolshevik delegation led by Kamenev did not
withdraw from the meeting, thereby permitting discussion of the
proposals submitted by the Mensheviks and the Right S.-R.'s. The
next day, on November 14, a meeting of the Central Committee was
called, at which Lenin demanded that the talks with the
Railwaymen's Executive, who had gone over to the side of the
Kaledins and Kornilovs, should be broken off immediately. A
resolution to that effect was adopted by the Central
Committee. On the 17th, Nogin, Rykov, V. Milyutin and
Teodorovich announced their resignation from the Council of
People's Commissars on the grounds that they considered it
necessary to form a socialist government of all the Socialist
parties. They were joined by a number of other
Commissars. Kamenev, Rykov, Zinoviev, Nogin and Milyutin
announced their resignation from the Central Committee. All of
them had stood for the formation of an all-party coalition
government right after the victory of the October
Revolution. The Central Committee demanded that they should
submit to Party discipline. Ilyich was indignant and fought hard
on this point. Zinoviev published a statement announcing his
return to the Central Committee.</p><p>
The further victories of the Bolsheviks and the Petrograd and
Moscow organizations' sharp disapproval of these comrades'
conduct (their resignation from the Central Committee and
their official posts) enabled the Party to liquidate this
incident fairly quickly. It took one's thoughts back to the
past&#8211;to the Second Congress of the Party fourteen years
earlier, in 1903. The Party then had only just begun to form,
and Martov's refusal to join the editorial board of
<em>Iskra</em> had provoked a serious crisis in the Party, which
had caused Ilyich great distress. The present resignation of a
number of comrades from the Central Committee and from their
posts of Commissars merely created temporary difficulties. The
uplift of the revolutionary movement had helped to quickly
liquidate this incident, and Ilyich, who always spoke about what
was on his mind at the moment during our walks together, never
once mentioned this incident. His mind was set
entirely on the problem of how to begin building up the socialist system of life, how to put into effect the resolutions passed at the Second Congress of Soviets.</p><p>
On November 17, Ilyich spoke at the meeting of the All-Russian
Central Executive Committee and the meeting of the Petrograd
Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies held jointly with
army delegates from the front. His speeches breathed
absolute confidence in victory, confidence in the
correctness of the line which the Bolsheviks had taken,
confidence in the support of the masses.</p><p>
"The criminal inertia of the Kerensky Government brought the
country and the revolution to the brink of disaster; truly,
delay spells death, and in issuing laws that meet the hopes and
wishes of the broad masses of the people, the new government is
setting landmarks upon the path of development of new forms of
life. The local Soviets, in keeping with local conditions, may
modify, extend or supplement the basic principles which the
government establishes. The basic factor of the new public life
is the live creative effort of the masses. Let the workers set
up a workers' control of their factories, let them supply the
countryside with manufactures, barter them for
grain. Every single commodity, every pound of bread should he
accounted for, for socialism, above all, means
accounting. <em>Socialism cannot be built up by decrees from
above. Official bureaucratic automatism is alien to its spirit;
living constructive socialism is the creation of the masses of
the people themselves."</em> (My italics.&#8211;N.K.) (Works,
Vol. 26, pp. 254-55.) </p><p>Wonderful words!</p><p>
"The power belongs to our Party, which has the support and trust of the broad masses of the people. Some of our comrades may have taken a stand that has nothing in common with Bolshevism. But the working masses of Moscow will not follow the lead of Rykov and Nogin," said Ilyich. (Ibid., p. 256.)</p><p>
He concluded his speech with the following words:</p><p>
"The Central Executive Committee charges the Council of People's Commissars to nominate candidates for the posts of People's Commissars for Internal Affairs and Trade and Industry for the next meeting, and offers Kolegayev the post of People's Commissar of Agriculture." (Ibid., p. 259.) Kolegayev was a Left Socialist-Revolutionary. He did not accept the proffered post. The party of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries still shirked responsibility.</p><p>
The Mensheviks, Right S.-R.'s and others agitated for
sabotage. The old government officials refused to work under the
Bolsheviks, and did not come to their offices. Addressing the
Petrograd Soviet on November 17, Lenin said: "They say we are
isolated. The bourgeoisie has created an atmosphere of lies and
slander around us, but I have not seen a soldier yet who has not
hailed the passing of power into the hands of the Soviets with
enthusiasm. I have not seen a peasant who was against the
Soviets." (Works, Vol. 26, p. 262.)</p><p>
And this gave Lenin
confidence in victory.</p><p>
On November 21, 1917, Yakov Sverdlov was elected Chairman of the
All-Russian Central Executive Committee in place of
L.B. Kamenev. He was nominated by Ilyich. The choice was an
exceedingly happy one. Sverdlov was a man of great firmness. In
the struggle for the Soviet power, in the struggle against the
counter-revolution, he was indispensable. Moreover, there was a
tremendous job to be done in organizing a state of a new type,
and this job called for an organizer of exceptional
ability. Sverdlov was just that kind of organizer.</p><p>
Two years later, on March 18, 1919, after having accomplished a
tremendous organizing job for the good of the country at a time
of its greatest need, Sverdlov died. Lenin's speech at the
special meeting of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee
held in connection with his death, has gone down in history as a
splendid memorial to that devoted champion of the working-class
cause. "In the course of our revolution and its victories," said
Lenin, "Comrade Sverdlov has succeeded, more fully and wholly
than anyone else, in expressing the most important and essential
features of the proletarian revolution...." The most "profound
and constant feature of this revolution and the condition for
its victory," Ilyich continued, "has always been the
organization of the proletarian masses, the organization of the
working people. It is this organization of the millions of the
working people that constitutes the finest conditions for the
revolution, the deepest source of its victories.... It was this
feature of the revolution that advanced to the fore such a man
as Y. M. Sverdlov, who was an organizer <em>par
excellence."</em> Ilyich described Sverdlov as "a most clear-cut
type of professional revolutionary," wholeheartedly devoted to
the cause of the revolution, steeled by long years of
underground illegal activity, a man who never lost touch with
the masses, never left Russia, a revolutionary who "succeeded in
becoming not only a leader beloved of the workers, not only a
leader who was best and most widely familiar with the practical
work, but also an organizer of the advanced proletarians.... It
is to the remarkable organizing ability of this man that we owe
whatever we have so far taken such pride in. He has secured for
us the full opportunity for really organized, rational teamwork,
worthy of the organized proletarian masses and fitting the needs
of the proletarian revolution&#8211;organized teamwork without
which we could not have achieved a single success, without
which we could not have overcome a single one of those
innumerable difficulties, a single one of those hardships which
we have had to face till now and are compelled to face at the
present moment." Ilyich characterized Sverdlov as an organizer
who had won for himself an "unassailable reputation," an
organizer of "the whole Soviet power in Russia" and "the most
experienced" organizer of "the work of the Party, which created
these Soviets and practically implemented the Soviet power."
(Works, Vol. 29, pp. 70-74.)</p><p>
The October Revolution altered the conditions of the
revolutionary struggle. These new conditions of struggle
demanded of a man greater determination, greater pertinacity,
greater "stamina," to use a favourite word of Vladimir Ilyich,
greater organizing scope. "The essence of socialism in the
making is organization," Ilyich often said. It was no accident
that the course of events brought to the fore men who were
not afraid to shoulder responsibility, men whose abilities had
been cramped by the conditions of the old underground; constant
arrests and deportations had brought their organizing efforts
to naught, while the need for secrecy had kept them in the
background. One such man was Stalin, an outstanding organizer of
the Party and of the victory of October. It was not for nothing
that when candidates for People's Commissars were being
nominated at the Second Congress of Soviets Ilyich proposed that
Stalin should be appointed Chairman of the Commissariat for the
Affairs of Nationalities. Ilyich had striven for years to
bring about the liberation of the non-Russian nationalities and
give them an opportunity for all-round development; during the
last few years he had fought harder than ever for the right of
nations to self-determination. I remember how closely he took to
heart every little thing that had any bearing on this question,
and how furious he got one day when I told him that there was
some hesitation at the People's Commissariat of Education on the
question as to whether historical monuments of value to the
Poles should be restored to them or not. Ilyich hated
great-power chauvinism with all his soul, and there was nothing
he desired more passionately than that the Republic of the
Soviets should offset the imperialist policy of oppressing the
weaker nationalities by its own policy of complete liberation
for those nationalities, a policy of comradely solicitude for
their welfare. He knew Stalin's views on the national question
very well, as they had often discussed the subject in Cracow. He
was confident that Stalin would consider himself in honour bound
to carry out in deed and not in word all that had been so
carefully thought out and discussed on this subject during
previous years. The nationalities had to be given the right to
self-determination. The task was complicated by the fact that
this right had to be enforced under conditions of acute class
struggle. The work of putting into effect the nations' right to
self-determination had to be combined with the struggle for the
dictatorship of the proletariat and the implementation of the
power of the Soviets. This question was closely linked, with the
question of the international struggle of the proletariat and
the questions of the civil war. A broad mind, profound
conviction and practical organizing ability were required of the
person in charge of affairs on the national front. That is why
Ilyich proposed Stalin for the job.</p><p>
The problem of learning how to work the new way, learning new
habits of mind, the problem of making leading, capable and
tenacious builders of the socialist system out of yesterday's
revolutionary opposition, loomed large before all Party workers.</p><hr class="end"><p>
Ilyich and I moved into Smolny. We were given a room there formerly occupied by a <em>dame de class.</em> It was partitioned off to make room for a bed. Admission to it was through the wash-room. A lift took you upstairs where Ilyich had his private office. Facing this was a small outer office used as a waiting room. Delegation after delegation came to see him. Most of them were from the front. Often, when going up to him, I would find him in the outer office. The room would be crowded with soldiers, all standing up and listening to Ilyich, who was talking to them by the window. Ilyich worked in the bustling atmosphere of Smolny, which was always crowded with people. Everyone came there, as if drawn by a magnet. Smolny was guarded by soldiers of the machine-gun regiment, the same regiment that had been quartered in the Vyborg District in the summer of 1917 and was completely under the influence of the workers there. It had been the first to come out in July 3, 1917, eager to join the fray. Kerensky had decided to make an example of the rebels. They were disarmed and marched out on to the square where they were publicly degraded. After that the machine-gunners hated the Provisional Government worse than ever. In October they fought for the Soviet power and afterwards took over guard duty at Smolny. One machine-gunner by the name of Zheltishev, an Ufa peasant, was told off to look after Ilyich. He was greatly attached to Ilyich and took care of him, attending to his wants and bringing him his meals from the canteen, which was then housed in Smolny. Zheltishev was naive to a degree. He was for ever wondering at things. Even the spirit-lamp set him wondering. I came into the room once and found him sitting on his haunches pouring spirits on the burning lamp that stood before him on the floor. Even the taps and the crockery set him wondering. The machine-gunners who were guarding Smolny once came upon a pile of caskets used by the young ladies of the former Smolny Institute. Curious to know what was in them, they prized them open with their bayonets. They found them to contain diaries, all kinds or knick-knacks and ribbons. The men gave them away to the children of the neighbourhood. Zheltishev brought me a trinket&#8211;a round little mirror with carving on it and the word "Niagara" in English letters. I still have it. Ilyich sometimes exchanged a word with Zheltishev, and the latter was prepared to do anything in the world for him. Zheltishev was supposed to attend on Trotsky, too, who lived opposite us with his family in the rooms formerly occupied by the head mistress of the Institute. But he did not like Trotsky. "He was much too bossy," he once wrote to me.</p><p>
He is now living in a collective farm in the Bashkir
Republic. He has a large family, is ailing, goes in for bee-keeping,
and writes to me occasionally, recollecting things about
Ilyich.</p><p>
I was at work all day, first in the Vyborg District Council,
then in the Commissariat of Education. Ilyich was left pretty
much to shift for himself. Zheltishev brought him his meals and
bread-the usual rations. Maria Ilyinichna sometimes brought him
some food from home, but he had no one to take regular care of
his meals, as I was hardly ever at home. A young fellow named
Korotkov recently told me of an incident connected with
Lenin. He was a boy of twelve at the time, living with his
mother, who was an office cleaner at Smolny. Once she heard
someone walking about in the canteen. She looked in, and there
was Ilyich standing at a table eating a piece of black bread and
herring to which he had helped himself. He was somewhat taken
aback at the sight of the office cleaner, and said with a smile:
"I felt very hungry, you know." Korotkova knew Vladimir
Ilyich. Once, during the days immediately following the
revolution, Ilyich was coming down the stairs, which she was
washing. She stood leaning on the banister, resting. Ilyich
stopped and talked to her. She did not know who he was at the
time. He said to her: "Well, Comrade, don't you find things
better now under the Soviet power than under the old
government?" And she answered: "Oh, I don't care, so long as I
get paid for my work." Afterwards, when she got to know it had
been Lenin, she could not get over it. She told that story of
how she had answered Lenin as long as she lived. She is now an
old-age pensioner, and her son, who had then been employed in
the Forwarding Department of Smolny has taken his degree as

And then, at last, Shotman's mother, a Finn, took matters in
hand. She was very fond of her son and proud
of the fact that he had been a delegate to the Second Party Congress and helped Ilyich to hide himself during the July days. Soon she had everything in the house ship-shape, the way Ilyich liked it, and put Zheltishev, and the cleaners, and the waitresses in the canteen through their paces. I could rest assured now, when going away, that Ilyich would be properly looked after and given his meals.</p><p>
Late in the afternoon, when I came home from work, Ilyich (if he
was disengaged) and I would go for a stroll round Smolny and
have a chat. Few people knew Ilyich by sight in those days, and
he used to go about unattended. True, the machine-gunners,
seeing him go out, used to worry about it, and they saw to it
that the Smolny area alas kept clear of hostile elements. Once
they ran in a dozen or so housewives who had collected on the
corner and were railing loudly at Lenin. Malkov, the commandant
of Smolny, sent for me the next morning and said: "We ran some
women in yesterday&#8211;they were kicking up a row. What am I to
do with them? Will you have a look at them?" For one thing it
turned out that most of the women had slipped away, and the rest
were such an ignorant lot far removed from politics that I
laughingly advised Malkov to let them go. One of the women, on
being released, came back and asked me in a whisper, pointing to
Malkov: "Is that Lenin?" I dismissed her with a smile.</p><p>
We lived in Smolny up to March 1918, when we moved to Moscow.</p>
