The masses of Petrograd &#8211; workers, soldiers and sailors &#8211; came
to welcome their leader. Many of our close comrades were there,
too, among them Chugurin, a student of the Longjumeau school, with
a broad crimson sash across his shoulder and his face wet with
tears. We were in the midst of a surging sea of people.</P>
<p>
No one who has not lived through the revolution can have any
idea of its solemn grandeur. Red banners, a guard of honour of
Kronstadt sailors, searchlights from the Peter and Paul Fortress
lighting up the way from the Finland Station to the Krzesinska
Mansion, armoured cars, files of working men and women guarding
the road.</P>
<p>
Chkheidze and Skobelev met us at the station in the capacity
of official representatives of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers'
and Soldiers' Deputies. Comrades conducted Ilyich to the royal
waiting room where Chkheidze and Skobelev met us. When Ilyich
stepped out on to the platform, a captain came up to him, stood at
attention and reported. Taken by surprise, Ilyich returned the
salute. A guard of honour was lined up on the platform, and Ilyich
was led past it with all the rest of the emigrant fraternity
following. Then we were seated in motor-cars, while Ilyich was
placed on an armoured car, and all of us were driven to the
Krzesinska Mansion. "Long live the socialist world revolution!"
Ilyich shouted into the vast crowd swarming around us.</P>
<p>
Ilyich already felt the beginning of that revolution in every fibre of his being.</P>
<p>
We were taken to the Krzesinska Mansion, which then housed the
Central Committee and Petrograd Committee of
the Party. The comrades arranged a tea party upstairs and wanted to organize speeches of welcome, but Ilyich switched the talk over to a subject that interested him now most of all &#8211; the tactics that had to be pursued. Crowds of workers and soldiers stood outside the Krzesinska Mansion, and Ilyich was obliged to address them from the balcony. The impressions of this meeting, and the tremendous revolutionary enthusiasm threw everything else into the shade.</P>
<p>
We then went home to Lenin's sister, Anna Ilyinichna and her
husband Mark Yelizarov. Maria Ilyinichna was living with them
too. They lived in Shirokaya Street, on Petrograd Side. We were
given a separate room. Little Gora, Anna Ilyinichna's foster son,
had hung a slogan over our beds in honour of our arrival, reading:
"Workers of All Countries, Unite!" Ilyich and I hardly spoke a
word that night &#8211; no words could express what we felt that day;
things were clear enough without words.</P>
<p>
We were living at a time when every moment was
precious. Ilyich had scarcely got up when comrades called for him
to go to a meeting of Bolshevik members of the All-Russian
Conference of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. It was
on an upper floor of the Taurida Palace. Lenin expounded his views
as to what had to be done in a number of theses [Lenin's <EM>April Theses</EM>]. In these theses he weighed the situation, and
clearly set forth the aims that had to be striven for and the ways
that had to be followed to attain them. The comrades were somewhat
taken aback for the moment. Many of them thought that Ilyich was
presenting the case in much too blunt a manner, and that it was
too early yet to speak of a socialist revolution.</P>
<p>
Downstairs a meeting of the Mensheviks was in progress. A
comrade came from there insisting that Ilyich should make a
similar report at a joint meeting of Menshevik and Bolshevik
delegates. The Bolshevik meeting decided that Ilyich was to repeat
his report at a general meeting of all the
Social-Democrats. Ilyich did so. The meeting took place downstairs
in the large hall of the palace. The first thing that struck me, I
remember, was Goldenberg (Meshkovsky) sitting in the presiding
committee. During the Revolution of 1905 he had been a staunch
Bolshevik, one of our closest comrades in the struggle. Now he
sided with Plekhanov and had become a defencist. Lenin spoke for
about two hours. Goldenberg took the floor against him. He spoke
very sharply, saying that Lenin had raised the banner of civil war
in the midst of the revolutionary democrats. We could see now how
far apart we had drifted. I also remember Kollontai's speech, in
which she warmly defended Lenin's theses.</P>
<p>
In his newspaper <EM>Yedinstvo,</EM> Plekhanov called Lenin's theses "ravings."</P>
<p>
Three days later, on April 7, Lenin's theses were printed in
<EM>Pravda.</EM> This was followed the next day by an article in
<EM>Pravda</EM> by Kamenev "Our Disagreements," in which he
dissociated himself from these theses. Kamenev's article stated
that they were the expression of Lenin's private views, which
neither <EM>Pravda</EM> nor the Bureau of the Central Committee
shared. It was not these theses of Lenin's that the Bolshevik
delegates had accepted, but those of the Central Committee Bureau,
Kamenev alleged. <EM>Pravda</EM> stood on its former positions, he
declared.</P>
<p>
A struggle started within the Bolshevik organization. It did not
last long. A week later a general city conference of the
Bolsheviks of Petrograd took place, at which Ilyich's
point of view was upheld. The conference lasted eight days
(from April 14 to 22), during which time a number of important
events took place which showed that Lenin had been right.</p>
<p>
On April 7, the day Lenin's theses were first published, the
Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet voted in favour of the
"Liberty Loan."</P>
<p>
The bourgeois and defencist newspapers started a furious
hounding campaign against Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Kamenev's
opinion meant nothing &#8211; everyone knew that Lenin's point of view
would win the backing of the Bolshevik organization. The campaign
against Lenin was the most effective way of popularizing his
theses. Lenin had called the war an imperialist war of plunder,
and everyone saw that he stood for peace in real earnest. This
stirred the sailors and soldiers, stirred all those for whom the
war was a life-and-death issue. On April 10 Ilyich
addressed the soldiers of the Izmailovsky Regiment; on the
15th<EM> Soldatskaya Pravda (Soldiers' Truth)</EM> began to
appear, and on the 16th the soldiers and sailors of Petrograd held
a demonstration of protest against the campaign that was against
Lenin and the Bolsheviks. On April 18 (May 1, New Style) a great
May Day demonstration was held throughout Russia such as had never
been seen before.</P>
<p>
On the same day Milyukov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
issued a statement in the name of the Provisional Government to
the effect that it would continue the war to a victorious end and
would fulfil all its obligations to the Allies. What did the
Bolsheviks do? They showed up in the press what those obligations
were. The Provisional Government, they pointed out, had pledged
itself to fulfil the obligations incurred by the government of
Nicholas II and the whole tsarist clique. They showed that those
obligations had been incurred on behalf of the bourgeoisie.</P>
<p>
When this became clear to the masses, they came out on the
streets. On April 21 they demonstrated on Nevsky Prospekt. A
counter-demonstration was held there by supporters of the
Provisional Government.</P>
<p>
These events united the Bolshevik ranks. The Petrograd
organization of the Bolsheviks passed resolutions in the spirit of
Lenin's views.</P>
<p>
On April 21 and 22 the Central Committee passed resolutions
clearly admitting the necessity of exposing the Provisional
Government; it condemned the conciliatory tactics of the Petrograd
Soviet, called for a re-election of workers' and soldiers'
deputies, urged the strengthening of the Soviets, and the conduct
of a wide explanatory campaign, while at the same time pointing
out that attempts to immediately overthrow the Provisional
Government were premature.</P>
<p>
By the time the All-Russian Conference opened on April 24,
three weeks after Lenin made public his theses, unity among the
Bolsheviks had already been achieved.</P>
<p>
After our arrival in Petrograd I saw little of Ilyich. He was
working at the Central Committee and in <EM>Pravda,</EM> and
addressing meetings. I went to work at the Secretariat of the
Central Committee in the Krzesinska Mansion, but it was nothing
like the secretarial job I had done abroad or that of 1905-1907,
when I had done rather important work on my own under Ilyich's
direction. Stasova was the secretary, and she had a staff of
assistants to do the clerical work. My job involved talking to the
Party workers who visited us, but I knew little about local
activities at that time. Central Committee members came often,
especially Sverdlov. I was a bit out of touch, though, and the
absence of any definite duties was irksome. But then I drank in
the life around me. The streets in those days presented a curious
spectacle: everywhere people stood about in knots, arguing
heatedly and discussing the latest events. I used to mingle with
the crowd and listen. These street meetings were so interesting,
that it once took me three hours to walk from Shirokaya Street to
the Krzesinska Mansion. The house in which we lived overlooked a
courtyard, and even here, if you opened the window at night, you
could hear a heated dispute. A soldier would be sitting there, and
he always had an audience &#8211; usually some of the cooks, or
housemaids from next door, or some young people. An hour after
midnight you could catch snatches of talk &#8211; "Bolsheviks,
Mensheviks...." At three in the morning "Milyukov, Bolsheviks...."
At five &#8211; still the same street-corner-meeting talk, politics,
etc. Petrograd's white nights are always associated in my mind now
with those all-night political disputes.</P>
<p>
At the Secretariat of the Central Committee I had occasion to
meet lots of people. Besides the Central Committee, the Krzesinska
Mansion housed the military organization and <EM>Soldatskaya
Pravda </EM>offices. Sometimes I attended the meetings of the
Central Committee, where I got to know the people more closely,
and followed the work of the Petrograd Committee. The youngsters
and working-class youth interested me greatly too. The movement
had taken hold of them. They represented different trends of
opinion  &#8211; Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and
Anarchists. There were up to fifty thousand young people in the
organization, but at the beginning the movement was left pretty
much to itself. I did some work among them. A direct contrast to
this working-class youth were the senior pupils of the high
schools. They often came in a crowd to the Krzesinska Mansion and
shouted abuse at the Bolsheviks. They were obviously being
thoroughly indoctrinated.</P>
<p>
Shortly after our arrival &#8211; I do not remember the exact
date &#8211; I attended a teachers congress. There was a big crowd
there. The teachers were completely under the influence of the
Socialist-Revolutionaries. Prominent defencists spoke at the
congress. On the day I went there, Alexinsky had addressed it in
the morning before my arrival. There were altogether fifteen to
twenty Social-Democrats there, including Bolsheviks and
Menshevik-Internationalists. They gathered in a small separate
room where they compared notes as to the kind of school to be
aimed at. Many of those present at that meeting afterwards worked
in the district councils. The mass of the teachers were drunk with
the fumes of chauvinism.</P>
<p>
On April 18 (May 1, New Style) Ilyich took part in the May
Day demonstration. He spoke in the Okhta District and the Field of
Mars. I did not hear him, as I was ill in bed that day. When
Ilyich came home I was struck by his excited face. We usually
attended May Day meetings when we lived abroad, but it was one
thing to go to a May Day meeting sanctioned by the police, and
quite another to follow a May Day procession of the revolutionary
people, a people who had overthrown tsarism.</P>
<p>
On April 21 I was to meet Ilyich at Danskoi's. The address
given to me was No. 3 Staro-Nevsky and I walked all the way down
Nevsky Prospekt. A big workers' demonstration was marching from
the Nevskaya Zastava. Working people crowding the pavements
greeted it as it passed. "Come along!" one young woman worker
shouted to another standing on the pavement. "We're going to march
all night!" Another crowd wearing hats and bowlers was coming from
the other direction; it was greeted by hats and bowlers on the
pavements. In the Nevskaya Zastava area workers predominated, but
round about Morskaya Street and Politseisky Most the bowlers
outnumbered them. Among this crowd the story passed from mouth to
mouth about how Lenin had bribed the workers with German gold, and
now they were all for him. "We must beat Lenin!" screamed a
stylishly dressed young woman. "All those scoundrels ought to be
killed!" shouted a man in a bowler. Class against class! The
working class was for Lenin.</P>
<p>
The All-Russian Party Conference, known as the April
Conference, was held from April 24th to 29th. A hundred and
fifty-one delegates attended. The conference elected a new Central
Committee, and very important issues were discussed at it, namely,
the political situation, the war, the inauguration of a Third
International, the national question, the agrarian question and
the Party programme.</P>
<p>
I particularly remember Lenin's speech on the political
situation. It brought out most strikingly Ilyich's attitude
towards the masses, and showed how closely he followed their lives
and interests. "There is no doubt that, as a class, the
proletariat and semi-proletariat are not interested in the
war. They are influenced by tradition and deception. They still
lack political experience. Therefore, our task is that of
patiently explaining. Our principles remain intact, we do not make
the slightest compromise; yet we cannot approach those masses as
we approach the social-chauvinists. Those elements of our
population have never been Socialists, they have not the slightest
conception of socialism, they are just awakening to political
life. But their class-consciousness is growing and broadening with
extraordinary rapidity. One must know how to approach them with
explanations, and this is now the most difficult task,
particularly for a party that but yesterday was underground."</P> 
<P>"Many of us, myself included," said Ilyich in his speech, "have
had occasion to address the people, particularly the soldiers, and
it seems to me that even when everything is explained to them from
the point of view of class interests, there is still one thing in
our position that they cannot fully grasp, namely, in what way we
intend to finish the war, in what way we think it possible to
bring the war to an end. The masses are in a maze of
misapprehension, there is an absolute lack of understanding as to
our position, that is why we must be particularly clear in this
case. </P>
<p>
"In approaching the masses, we must offer concrete answers to all questions." </P>
<p>
We must be able, said Ilyich, to carry on the work of
explanation not only among the proletariat, but also among wide
sections of the petty bourgeoisie.</P>
<p>
Speaking of control, Vladimir Ilyich said: "To control, one
must have power. If the broad masses of the petty-bourgeois bloc
do not understand this, we must have the patience to explain it to
them, but under no circumstances must we tell them an untruth."
Ilyich never stooped to demagogy, and this the soldiers and
peasants who spoke to him always felt. Confidence, however, is
not won off-hand. Even in those stirring times Ilyich kept a
level head. "So far we are in the minority; the masses do not
trust us yet. We can wait; they will side with us when the
government reveals its true nature." Ilyich had many talks with
soldiers and peasants, and had already seen no few evidences of
trust, yet he entertained no illusions. "The proletarian party
would be guilty of the most grievous error if it shaped its policy
on the basis of subjective desires where organization is
required. We cannot assert that the majority is with us: in this
case our motto should be caution, caution, caution. To base our
proletarian policy on over-confidence means to condemn it to
failure." </P>
<p>
In concluding his speech on the political situation, Ilyich
said: "The Russian Revolution has created the Soviets. No
bourgeois country in the world has or can have such state
institutions. No socialist revolution can function with any other
state power. The Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies must
seize power not for the purpose of building an ordinary bourgeois
republic, nor for the purpose of direct transition to
socialism. The latter could not be accomplished. What, then, is
the purpose? They must seize power in order to take the first
concrete steps towards this transition, steps that can and should
be made. In this case fear is the greatest enemy. The masses
should be convinced that these steps must be taken immediately,
that otherwise the power of the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers'
Deputies would be devoid of meaning, and would offer nothing to
the people." </P>
<p>
Ilyich went on to speak about the immediate tasks confronting
the Soviets. "Private ownership of land must be abolished. This is
our first task, because the majority of the people are for it. To
accomplish this we need the Soviets. This measure cannot be
carried out by means of the old government bureaucracy." He wound
up his speech with an example showing what the struggle for power
locally means. "I shall conclude by referring to the speech that
made the strongest impression on me. I heard a coal-miner deliver
a remarkable speech. Without using a single bookish word, he told
how they had made the revolution. Those miners were not concerned
with the question as to whether or not they should have a
president. They seized the mine, and the important question to
them was how to keep the cables intact so that production might
not be interrupted. Then came the question of bread, of which
there was a scarcity. And the miners again agreed on the method of
obtaining it. Now this is a real programme of the revolution,
not derived from books. This is a real seizure of power
locally." </P>
<p>
Zinaida Krzhizhanovskaya once recalled my having told her
about this miner's speech, and said: "What the miners need now is
their own engineers. Vladimir Ilyich thinks it would be fine if
Gleb went down there."</P>
<p>
We met lots of people we knew at the conference. I remember,
among others, meeting Prisyagin, a former student of the
Longjumeau school, and how his eyes shone as he listened to
Ilyich's speech. Prisyagin is no longer among the living. He was
shot by the Whites in Siberia in 1918.</P>
<p>
Early in May 1917 Ilyich drafted amendments to the Party
programme. The imperialist war and the revolution had brought
about tremendous changes in social life, and this necessitated new
evaluations and a new approach. The old programme was terribly
outdated.</P>
<p>
The outline of the new minimum-programme was imbued with a
striving to improve, to raise the standard of living of the
masses, and give greater scope to their activity.</P>
<p>
I was becoming tired of my job at the Secretariat, and wanted
to get into real work among the masses. I also wanted to see more
of Ilyich, about whom I was getting very anxious. He was being
hounded more and more. Going down the street in the Petrograd
District you could hear the women saying to each other: "What's to
be done with this Lenin fellow who's come from Germany? He ought
to be drowned in a well, if you ask me." There was no doubt as to
the source from which all those rumours about bribery and
treachery came, but they did not make pleasant hearing
nevertheless. It was one thing to hear the bourgeoisie talk like
that, but quite another to hear it from the masses. I wrote an
article for <EM>Soldatskaya Pravda</EM> about Lenin under the
title "A Page from the History of the Party." Vladimir Ilyich
looked through the manuscript and made some corrections, and the
article was published in No. 21 of<EM> Soldatskaya Pravda</EM> for
May 13, 1917.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich used to come home tired, and I did not have
the heart to question him about affairs. But both of us felt a
need to talk things over the way we were used to doing &#8211; during a
walk. We sometimes managed to go for a walk along the quieter
streets of the Petrograd District. I remember once our taking such
a walk together with Shaumyan and Yenukidze, and Shaumyan gave
Ilyich some red badges, which his sons had asked him to give
Lenin. Ilyich smiled.</P>
<p>
We had known Stepan Shaumyan for a long time. He was
tremendously popular with the Baku proletariat. He joined the
Bolsheviks immediately after the Second Congress, and attended the
Stockholm and London congresses. At the Stockholm Congress he was
a member of the Mandate Commission. This congress was numerically
much bigger than either the Second or the Third congresses. At
those congresses we had known what every delegate stood for, but
here there were many delegates whom we hardly knew. A sharp
struggle was fought in the Mandate Commission over every
delegate. I remember the tough time
Shaumyan had on this commission. I was not present at the London Congress. Afterwards, during our second period of emigration, we carried on a lively correspondence with the Baku comrades. I remember them enquiring of me the reasons for the split with the <EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists, and me having to give them a full account of what it was all about.</P>
<p>
In 1913 Ilyich carried on a lively correspondence with
Shaumyan on the national question. A very interesting letter was
that of May 1914 in which Ilyich propounded the idea that the
Marxists of all or most of the nationalities of Russia should
submit to the Stale Duma the draft of a bill on the equal rights
of nations and the defence of the rights of the national
minorities. This draft, according to Lenin's idea, was to contain
a complete interpretation of what we understand by equality of
rights, including the question of language, the school and culture
in general, in all its aspects. "It seems to me," wrote Ilyich,
"that in this way we could popularly explain the folly of cultural
national autonomy and quash the adherents of that folly once
and for all." Ilyich even outlined such a draft.</P>
<p>
In 1917, therefore, Ilyich was glad to see Stepan and discuss
with him at first hand all the questions that then confronted the
Bolsheviks in all their urgency.</P>
<p>
I remember Ilyich's speech at the First All-Russian Congress
of Soviets of Workers and Soldiers' Deputies, which took place at
the military school on Vasilyevsky Island. We walked down long
corridors. The classrooms had been turned into dormitories for the
delegates. The hall was crowded, and the Bolsheviks sat at the
back in a small group. Lenin's speech was applauded only by the
Bolsheviks, but there was no doubt about the strong impression it
had made. Kerensky was said to have lain in a faint for three
hours after that speech. I do not vouch for the truth of that
story, though.</P>
<p>
In June elections to the district councils were held. I went
to Vasilyevsky Island to see how the election campaign was
going. The streets were flooded with working people, most of them
employees of the Tube Factory. There were also a lot of women
workers from the Laferme Factory. This factory voted for the
Socialist-Revolutionaries. Disputes raged all round; people were
not discussing candidates or personalities, but the activities of
the different parties and what they stood for. I was reminded of
the municipal elections in Paris when we were there: we had been
struck by the absence of political issues and by the extent to
which the personal element predominated everywhere. Here the
picture was just the reverse. Another thing that struck one was
the extent to which the masses had politically matured since
1905-1907. It was obvious that all read the newspapers of the
different political trends. One group was discussing the question
whether Bonapartism was possible in this country or not. A squat
figure, suspiciously spy-like in its snooping activity, looked
oddly out of place among this crowd of workers, who had become so
class-conscious during the last few years.</P>
<P>Revolutionary feeling among the masses was mounting.</P>
<p>
The Bolsheviks had decided to hold a demonstration on June
10. The Congress of Soviets banned it by a ruling that no
demonstrations were to be held in the course of three
days. Thereupon Ilyich insisted that the demonstration arranged by
the Petrograd Party Committee should be called off. He held that
since we recognized the power of the Soviets we were bound to
submit to the rulings of the Congress if we did not wish to play
into the hands of our opponents. Yielding to the temper of the
masses, however, the Congress of Soviets itself called a
demonstration for June 18 (Old Style). It was scarcely prepared,
however, for what happened. Nearly four hundred thousand workers
and soldiers took part in the demonstration. Ninety per cent of
the banners and posters bore the slogans of the Bolshevik Central
Committee: "All Power to the Soviets!" "Down with the Ten
Capitalist Ministers!" Only three posters supported the
Provisional Government (one was the Bund's, the other the
Plekhanov group's, and the third the Cossack Regiment's). Ilyich
referred to the 18th of June as one of the days of the turning
point. "The demonstration of June 18th," (July 1st, New Style) he
wrote, "became a demonstration of the strength and the policies of
the revolutionary proletariat which is giving direction to the
revolution, and is showing the way out of the blind alley. Therein
lies the colossal historical significance of the Sunday
demonstration, and therein does it differ in principle from the
demonstration which took place on the day of the funeral of the
victims of the revolution, or from that held on the First of
May. Then it was a universal<EM> tribute </EM>to the first victory
of the revolution and its heroes, a glance backward, cast by the
people over the first lap of the road to freedom and passed by
them most quickly and most successfully. The First of May was a
<EM>holiday </EM>of good wishes and hopes bound up with the
history of the labour movement of the world, with its ideal of
peace and socialism.</P>
<p>
"Neither of the demonstrations aimed at pointing out the
<EM>direction</EM> of the further advance of the
revolution. Neither could point out that direction. Neither the
first nor the second demonstration had placed before the masses,
and in the name of the masses, any concrete and definite questions
of the hour, questions as to whither and how the revolution must
proceed.</P>
<p>
"In this sense the 18th of June was the first political
demonstration of <EM>action;</EM> it was an exposition of issues
not in a book or in a newspaper, but in the street; not through
leaders, but through the masses. It showed how the various classes
act, wish to act, and should act, to further the revolution. The
bourgeoisie had hidden itself." </P>
<p>
The elections to the district councils were over. I was
elected to the Vyborg District Council. Only Bolshevik candidates
were returned here, and a few Menshevik-Internationalists. The
latter refused to work on the council. Those who worked on it were
all Bolsheviks &#8211; L. M. Mikhailov, Kuchmenko, Chugurin, another
comrade and I. Our council was housed at first in the same
building as the Party local, the secretary of which was Zhenya
Yegorova. Lacis worked there too. Our council and the Party
organization worked in close contact. This work in the Vyborg
District taught me a great deal. It was an excellent school of
Party and Soviet work. To me, who had lived abroad for so many
years and had never had the pluck to address even a small meeting
or write a single line for<EM> Pravda,</EM> such a school was very
necessary.</P>
<p>
The Vyborg District had a strong and active Bolshevik
membership, who enjoyed the confidence of the masses of
workers. Shortly after assuming office I took over the business of
the Vyborg District branch of the Committee for Relief of
Soldiers' Wives from my old friend and school chum Nina Gerd
(Struve's wife), with whom we had taught together at the Sunday
School, and, who, in the early years of the working-class
movement, had been a Social-Democrat. Now we held opposing points
of view on political matters. In handing over to me, she said:
"The soldiers' wives don't trust us. No matter what we do they are
never satisfied. They believe only in the Bolsheviks. Well then,
take things into your own hands, perhaps you'll make a better job
of it." We were not afraid to tackle the job, believing, that with
the active cooperation of the workers, we would succeed in
getting things going with a swing.</P>
<p>
The mass of the workers displayed an amazing activity in the
cultural as well as the political fields. Very soon we set up an
Education Council on which all the factories and mills of the
Vyborg District were represented. Of the various factory
representatives I remember Purishev, Kayurov, Yurkin and
Gordienko. We met every week and discussed practical
measures. When the question of general literacy came up, the
workers at the factories very quickly drew up a registry of all
the illiterates. The employers were asked to provide premises for
reading and writing classes, and when one of them refused to
comply, the women workers kicked up a terrific row in the course
of which it came to light that one of the rooms at the factory was
occupied by a special squad of soldiers picked from the most
chauvinistic battalions. In the end the employer was obliged to
rent outside premises for the school. Class attendance and the
teachers work were supervised by the workers. A machine-gun
regiment was quartered not far from the District Council. It was
considered highly reliable at first, but this "reliability"
quickly melted away. The moment the regiment was quartered in the
Vyborg District agitation was started among the soldiers. The
first to agitate in favour of the Bolsheviks were the women
vendors of sunflower seeds, kvass, etc. Many of them were women
workers whom I had known in the nineties and even during the
Revolution of 1905. They were well-dressed, active at meetings,
and politically alert. One of them told me: "My husband's at the
front. We got on well together, but I don't know how things will
be when he gets back. I'm for the Bolsheviks now, I'm going with
them, but I don't know about him there at the front &#8211; whether he
realizes that we've got to go with the Bolsheviks. I often lie
thinking at night &#8211; what if he hasn't grasped it yet? I don't know
whether I'll see him again, though. He may be killed, and I'm
spitting blood, you know &#8211; I am going to the hospital." I shall
never forget the thin face of that woman worker with the hectic
flush in her cheeks, and her worrying about her and her husband
possibly having to part because of differing views. But it was the
working men and not the women who then took the lead in
educational activities. They went deep into every
detail. Gordienko, for instance, gave a good deal of his time to
kindergarten work. Kuklin closely followed the work of the young
people.</P>
<p>
I, too, closely tackled the work among the youth. The
Light and Knowledge League had worked out a programme of its
own. Its members consisted of Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, Anarchists
and non-Party people. The programme was naive and primitive to a
degree, but the dispute it gave rise to was very interesting. One
of the clauses, for example, said that all members must learn to
sew. One lad &#8211; a Bolshevik &#8211; remarked: "Why should we all learn to
sew? I can understand if it's a girl having to learn it, because
otherwise she won't be able to sew a button on her husband's
trousers when the time comes, but why should we all learn!" This
remark raised a storm of indignation. The boys as well as the
girls protested, and jumped up from their seats. "Who said the
wife must sew buttons on trousers? What do you mean? So you stand
for the old domestic slavery of women? A wife is her husband's
comrade, not his servant!" The unfortunate mover of the
women-only-learning-to-sew resolution was obliged to climb
down. I remember a conversation with Murashov, another young man,
who was a warm supporter of the Bolsheviks. "Why don't you join
the Bolshevik organization?" I asked him. "Well, you see," he
said, "there were several of us young people in the
organization. But why did we join? Do you think it was because we
understood that the Bolsheviks were right? No, the reason was that
the Bolsheviks were distributing revolvers to their people. That's
no good at all. You've got to have an intelligent reason for
joining. So I returned my Party card until I got the thing
straight in my own mind." I must say, though, that only
revolutionary-minded young people belonged to the Light and
Knowledge League; they would not have tolerated anyone in their
midst who upheld Right views. They were all active members, who
spoke at meetings at their factories. Their trouble was that they
were much too credulous. This credulity had to be combatted.</P>
<p>
I had a lot of work to do among the women too. I had got over
my former shyness and spoke wherever I had to.</P>
<p>
I threw myself into the job with enthusiasm. I wanted to draw
all the masses into social work, make possible that "people's
militia" of which Vladimir Ilyich had spoken.</P>
<p>
I saw still less of Ilyich when I started work in the Vyborg
District. Those were crucial days and the struggle was mounting
high. June 18 was not only a day when four hundred thousand
workers and soldiers demonstrated under Bolshevik slogans, it was
a day when the Provisional Government, after three months of
vacillation, gave way at last to pressure from the Allies and
launched an offensive at the front. The Bolsheviks had already
started to agitate in the press and at meetings. The Provisional
Government felt that the ground was slipping from under its
feet. June 28 saw the beginning of the rout of the Russian
army at the front; this greatly disturbed the soldiers.</P>
<p>
At the end of June Ilyich went to the country for a few days'
rest with Maria Ilyinichna. They stayed with the Bonch-Bruyeviches
in the village of Neivola, near station Mustamaki (not far from
Petrograd). Meanwhile the following events took place in
Petrograd. The machine-gun regiment quartered in the Vyborg
District decided to start an armed uprising. Two days before this,
our Education Committee had arranged to meet the regimental
Education Committee on Monday to discuss certain questions of
cultural work. Naturally, no one came from the regiment. The whole
machine-gun regiment had turned out. I went to the Krzesinska
Mansion. On my way there I caught up with the
machine-gunners. They were marching down Sampsonievsky Prospekt in
orderly ranks. One incident impressed itself on my mind. An old
workman stepped off the kerb and went towards the soldiers, bowing
low to them and saying in a loud voice: "That's it, boys, stand up
for us working folks." Among those present at the headquarters of
the Central Committee were Stalin and Lashevich. The
machine-gunners halted under the balcony of the Krzesinska
Mansion, saluted, then marched on. Two more regiments marched up
to the C.C. headquarters. followed by a workers'
demonstration. That evening a comrade was sent to Mustamaki for
Ilyich. The Central Committee had given the slogan to keep the
demonstration a peaceful one, but the machine-gun regiment was
already throwing up barricades. I remember Lashevich, who was in
charge of Party work in this regiment, lying on the sofa in the
office of the Vyborg District Council and staring up at the
ceiling for a long time before going out to the machine-gunners to
dissuade them from taking revolutionary action. It was hard on
him, but such was the decision of the Central Committee. The
factory workers had walked out. Sailors had arrived from
Kronstadt. A huge demonstration of armed workers and soldiers was
marching to the Taurida Palace. Ilyich spoke from the balcony of
the Krzesinska Mansion. The Central Committee issued an appeal to
stop the demonstration. The Provisional Government called out the
military cadets and Cossacks. Fire was opened on the
demonstrators in Sadovaya Street.</P>
