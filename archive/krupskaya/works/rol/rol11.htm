In Finland Ilyich was obliged to move still farther
inland. The Bogdanovs, Innokenty (Dubrovinsky) and I stayed on
at the Vaasa house in Kuokkala. There had already been police
raids at Terijoki, and we were expecting them at Kuokkala. Natalia
Bogdanova and I started cleaning up. We went through all the
files, picking out everything of value and giving it to Finnish
comrades to hide, while the rest we burned. We applied ourselves
to the task with such zeal that we were surprised one day to find
that the snow all round Vaasa was strewn with ashes. If the
gendarmes had put in an appearance, though, they would still have
found enough for their purpose. Stacks of papers had accumulated
in the house. Special precautions had to be taken. One morning our
landlady came running in to say that the gendarmes had turned up
at Kuokkala. She took away as much illegal stuff as she could
carry to hide in her own house. We sent Alexander Bogdanov and
Innokenty for a walk in the woods, and sat waiting for the police
to come with a search warrant. On that occasion, however, no
search was made. They were looking for the fighting-squad
comrades.</P>
<p>
The comrades had sent Ilyich to the hinterland. He lived at
Aggelby, a little station near Helsingfors, with two Finnish
sisters. He felt an utter stranger in that spotlessly clean cold
room, cosy in its Finnish way with lace curtains and everything
standing in its proper place, and with the incessant sound of
laughter, a piano and loud chatter in Finnish coming from the next
room. Ilyich spent all day writing his paper on the agrarian
question, during which he carefully weighed the experience of the
recent revolution. He walked up and down the room for hours on
tiptoes, so as not to disturb the landladies. I went to see him
there once.</P>
<p>
The police were looking for Ilyich all over Finland. He had to
leave the country. Plainly, the reaction was going to last for
years. We would have to move back to Switzerland. We had little
heart for it, but there was no other way. Besides, it was
necessary to arrange for the publication of <EM>Proletary</EM>
abroad, since this was no longer possible in Finland. Ilyich was
to leave for Stockholm at the first opportunity and wait for me
there. I had to fix up my sick old mother in St. Petersburg,
settle a number of other affairs and arrange future contacts
before following Ilyich out.</P>
<p>
While I was running about in St. Petersburg, Ilyich very
nearly lost his life on his way to Stockholm. He was being sO
closely shadowed that to go the usual way, that is, by embarking
at Abo, would have meant being arrested for certain. There had
already been cases of our people being arrested when boarding the
steamer. A Finnish comrade advised boarding the steamer at one of
the nearby islands. This was safe as far as avoiding arrest was
concerned, but it involved a three-mile walk across the ice to the
island, and although it was December the ice was not very strong
in some places. No guides were available, as no one cared to risk
his life. At last two tipsy peasants in a pot-valiant mood
undertook to escort Ilyich. Crossing the ice at night, all
three nearly drowned when the ice in one place suddenly started to
give way under them. They barely managed to jump for safety.</P>
<p>
I learned afterwards from Borgo, a Finnish comrade (he was
eventually shot by the White Guards), with whose help I crossed to
Stockholm, how dangerous had been the path Ilyich had chosen and
what a narrow escape he had had. Ilyich afterwards told me that
when the ice began to give way, his first thought had been: "Ah,
what a stupid way to die."</P>
<p>
An exodus of Russians started again &#8211; Bolsheviks, Mensheviks,
S.-R.'s left the country. On the boat going out I met Dan, Lydia
Zederbaum, and a couple of S.-R.'s.</P>
<p>
After a few days in Stockholm, Ilyich and I proceeded to
Geneva via Berlin. Searches and arrests had been made among the
Russians in Berlin on the eve of our arrival. We were met by
Avramov, a member of the Berlin group, who therefore advised us
not to go to the homes of any of our comrades. He led us about
from cafe to cafe all day long. We spent the evening with Rosa
Luxemburg. The Stuttgart Congress, at which Vladimir Ilyich and
Rosa Luxemburg had been at one on the question of war, had brought
them very close together. At that congress, as far back as 1907,
they had said that the struggle against war should aim not only at
peace but at the replacement of capitalism by socialism. The
crisis created by war should be utilized for the speedy overthrow
of the bourgeoisie. "The Stuttgart Congress," Ilyich wrote,
"sharply set off the opportunist and the revolutionary wings of
international Social-Democracy on a number of momentous issues and
gave its decision on these issues in a spirit of revolutionary
Marxism." At the Stuttgart Congress Rosa Luxemburg and Ilyich were
at one. Their talk together that evening was therefore more than
usually friendly.</P>
<p>
We returned to our hotel in the evening feeling ill. Both of
us had a white froth on our lips and felt extremely weak. As it
transpired afterwards, we had got fish-poisoning somewhere during
our round of the restaurants. A doctor had to be sent for during
the night. Vladimir Ilyich was registered as a Finnish chef and I
as an American citizen, and so the hotel attendant fetched an
American doctor. He examined Ilyich and said it was very serious,
then he examined me and said, "You will pull through all right!"
He prescribed a heap of medicines, and, smelling a rat, charged us
a terrific fee for the visit. We lay in bed for a couple of days,
then dragged ourselves off, half-ill, to Geneva, where we arrived
on January 7, 1908. Ilvich afterwards wrote to Gorky that we had
"caught a cold" during the journey.</P>
<p>
Geneva looked bleak. There was not a speck of snow about, and
a cold cutting wind was blowing &#8211; the bise. Post cards with a view
of the freezing water near the railings of the Geneva Lake
embankment were being sold. The town looked dead and empty. Among
the comrades living there at the time were Mikha Tskhakaya,
V. Karpinsky and Olga Ravich. Mikha Tskhakaya lived in a small
room and got out of bed with difficulty when we arrived. The
conversation flagged. The Karpinskys were then living in the
Russian library (formerly Kuklin's) where Karpinsky was
manager. He had a very bad headache when we arrived and kept
wincing all the time. All the shutters were closed, since
the light hurt him. As we were going back from the Karpinskys
through the desolate streets of Geneva, which had turned so
unfriendly, Ilyich let fall: "I have a feeling as if I've come
here to be buried."</P>
<p>
We were beginning our second period of emigration, a much harder one than the first.</P>
