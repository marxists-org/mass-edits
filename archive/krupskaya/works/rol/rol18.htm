The Years of The War</h1>
<H4>Cracow 1914</H4>

<p>
Although war had been in the air for a long time it came as a
shock to all of us. We had to get out of Poronino, but had no idea
where to go. Lilina was seriously ill at the time, and Zinoviev
could not leave in any case. They lived in Zakopane at the time,
and there were doctors there. He decided to stay on in Poronino
for the time being. Ilyich wrote to Kobetsky in Copenhagen,
asking to be kept informed, to establish contacts with Stockholm,
etc. The local hill people were utterly depressed when
mobilization started. No one had the faintest idea what the war
was all about and against whom it was being fought. There was no
enthusiasm whatever; men went like dumb animals to the
slaughter. Our landlady, a peasant woman who owned the summer
house, was numb with grief when her husband was called up. The
Catholic priest tried to fan a patriotic spark front the pulpit.
Rumours were rife, and the six-year-old boy of the poor family
next door, who was always hanging around our house, told me
confidentially that the Russians were putting poison in the
wells &#8211; so the priest had said.</P>
<p>
The local gendarme officer came to our house on August 7 with
a witness &#8211; a local peasant armed with a rifle &#8211; to make a
search. What exactly he was to search for, the officer did not
know himself. He rummaged about in the book-case, found an
unloaded pistol, took several notebooks with figures on the
agrarian question, and asked a few irrelevant questions. The
embarrassed witness sat on the edge of a chair, staring around
with a puzzled air, while the officer poked fun at him. He pointed
to a jar of paste and assured him it was a bomb. Then he told
Vladimir Ilyich that they had received information against him,
and that he really ought to arrest him, but as he would have to
take him down to Nowy Targ (the nearest place where there were
military authorities) the next morning in any case, Vladimir
Ilyich might just as well come down himself tomorrow in time to
catch the six o'clock morning train. One thing was clear &#8211; he was
going to be arrested, and in war-time, especially during the early
days of the war, it did not want much to have a man put out of the
way. Vladimir Ilyich went to see Ganiecki, who lived in Poronino
at the time, and told him what had happened. Ganiecki wired
immediately to the Social-Democratic Deputy Marek, and Vladimir
Ilyich wired to the Cracow police, who knew him as a political
emigrant. The thought of Mother and me remaining alone in Poronino
in a big house worried Ilyich, and he arranged with Tikhomirnov
for the latter to move into an upstairs room for the time
being. Tikhomirnov had recently returned from exile in Olonets,
and the <EM>Pravda</EM> editors had sent him to Poronino to take a
holiday and rest his shattered nerves, and, incidentally, to help
Ilyich to draw up reports in connection with the current campaigns
for a workers' press, etc, based on data published in
<EM>Pravda.</EM></P>
<p>
Ilyich and I sat up all night. We were very upset. I saw him
off in the morning and returned to an empty room. The same day
Ganiecki hired a farm cart which took him to Nowy Targ. He managed
to see the district officer in charge &#8211; the Royal Imperial
starosta &#8211; kicked up a row, told him that Ilyich was a member of
the International Socialist Bureau, a man who was in the public
eye and for whose life he, the officer, would have to answer. Then
he saw the inspector who was handling the case, told him who
Ilyich was, and got a permit for me to see Ilyich the next
day. When Ganiecki got back from Nowy Targ we both drew up a
letter to the Austrian Social-Democrat M.P. and member of the
International Bureau Victor Adler. At Nowy Targ I was permitted to
see Ilyich. I was left alone with him, but he spoke very
little &#8211; the situation was still extremely confused. The Cracow
police wired that there were no grounds for suspecting Ulyanov of
espionage. A similar telegram was received from Marek in Zakopane,
and a well-known Polish writer went to Nowy Targ to intercede on
Ilyich's behalf. On learning of Ilyich's arrest, Zinoviev, who
lived in Zakopane, cycled down in a pouring rain to see Doctor
Dlusski, the old Polish Narodovolets who lived ten versts
away. Dlusski immediately hired a phaeton and drove to Zakopane,
where he began sending telegrams, writing letters, and seeing
people. I was allowed to see Ilyich every day. I took the six
o'clock train to Nowy Targ every morning &#8211; it was an hour's
ride &#8211; then hung about the station, the post office and the
market-place until eleven, then I would have an hour's meeting
with Vladimir Ilyich. Ilyich told me about his prison mates. There
were a lot of local peasants in jail &#8211; some for having allowed
their passports to expire without renewal, some for not having
paid their taxes, others for wrangling with the local authorities,
etc. One of the prisoners was a Frenchman, another was a Polish
government clerk who had used someone's travelling pass to get a
cheap ride, a third was a Gypsy who carried on a shouted
conversation with his wife across the prison wall, where she would
take up her stand at set hours. Ilyich recalled his legal practice
in Shushenskoye among the peasants, whom he had helped out of all
kinds of predicaments, and he set up an improvised legal advice
office in prison, wrote petitions, etc. His prison mates called
Ilyich <EM>byczy chtop </EM>which means a "corker." The "corker"
gradually got used to prison life in Nowy Targ, and was more
composed and animated at our meetings. In this prison, at night,
when the inmates were asleep, he lay pondering and planning what
the Party had to do now, what steps had to be taken ill order to
convert the world war into a world struggle with the bourgeoisie
on the part of the proletariat. I gave Ilyich all the news about
the war I was able to obtain.</P>
<p>
What I did not tell him was this. Returning from the station
one day, I heard some peasant women coming out of the church
talking in loud voices &#8211; apparently for my benefit &#8211; about what they
would do to a spy if they got hold of one. If the authorities by
any chance let a spy go, they would see to it themselves that he
had his eyes put out, his tongue cut off, and so forth. Clearly,
we could not remain in Poronino after Ilyich was released. I began
packing up, sorting out what we needed to take with us and what we
could leave behind. Our household went to pieces. We had a
servant, whom we had hired for the summer because of Mother's
illness. She had been telling the neighbours all kinds of stories
about us and our connections with Russia, and I got rid of her as
fast as I could by paying her fare to Cracow, where she had been
eager to go, and her wages in advance. Our neighbour's girl helped
us to heat the stove and do the shopping. My mother &#8211; she was
already 72 years old &#8211; was feeling very poorly. She could see that
something was wrong, but could not make out exactly what it
was. Although I had told her that Vladimir Ilyich had been
arrested, she would talk at times about his having been called
up. She worried whenever I left the house &#8211; she had an idea that I
would disappear the way Vladimir Ilyich had done. Our lodger
Tikhomirnov smoked with a pensive air, while he helped with
packing up the books. Once had to get some kind of certificate
from the peasant witness whom the gendarme officer had made fun of
during the search of our rooms. I went to see him at the other end
of the village, and we had a long talk together in his hut &#8211; the
typical hut of a poor peasant &#8211; about what the war was all about,
why people were fighting it, and who was interested in having
it. We parted afterwards in a very friendly way.</P>
<p>
At last, the pressure brought to bear by the Vienna
M.P. Victor Adler and the Lvov M.P. Diamand, who both vouched for
Vladimir Ilyich, had its effect. On August 19 Vladimir Ilyich was
released from prison. I was at Nowy Targ as usual since early in
the morning, and this time they even let me go into the prison to
help take Ilyich's things. We hired a cart and went to
Poronino. There we were obliged to stay for about a week until we
received permission to move to Cracow. In Cracow we went to the
landlady with whom Kamenev and Inessa had lodged. Most of the
rooms were being used as a medical station, but she found a place
for us. She had other things to worry about, though. The first
battle had just been fought at Krasnik, in which two of her sons
were engaged. They had signed up as volunteers, and she did not
know what had become of them.</P>
<p>
The next day we witnessed a harrowing scene from the window of
the hotel to which we had moved. A train had arrived from Krasnik
with the dead and wounded. Relatives of the men who had fought in
the battle ran after the stretchers peering into the faces of the
dead and dying, trying yet dreading to identify their kin. Those
who were less seriously wounded walked slowly from the station
with bandaged heads and arms. The people who had come to meet the
train helped them to carry their things, offered them food and
mugs of beer obtained from nearby restaurants. "So this is war!"
one could not help thinking. And it was only the first battle.</P>
<p>
In Cracow it did not take us long to get permission to go
abroad to a neutral country &#8211; Switzerland. Certain matters had to
be attended to first. A little while before that my mother had
become a "capitalist." Her sister, a school-mistress, had died in
Novocherkassk and left all her property to her &#8211; silver spoons,
icons, articles of dress, and four thousand rubles saved up during
thirty years of teaching. The money was deposited in a Cracow
bank, and to get it from there we had to resort to a broker in
Vienna, who got the money for us and took exactly half of it for
his fee. We lived mainly on this money during the war, husbanding
it so carefully that we still had some of it left on our return to
Russia in 1917. And it was this money, a certificate for which was
issued during a police search of our rooms in St. Petersburg
during the July days of 1917, that served as evidence alleging
Vladimir Ilyich to have received money from the German Government
in payment for espionage.</P>
<p>
We were a whole week travelling from Cracow to the Swiss
frontier. Our train made long stops along the line to let military
trains pass. We observed the chauvinistic agitation which the nuns
and their active women associates carried on. At We railway
stations they distributed sacred images, prayer books and so on to
the soldiers. Dandyish military men sauntered about the
stations. The coaches had mottoes pasted ail over them telling men
what to do with the French, the English and the Russians:
<EM>"Jedem Russ ein Schuss!"</EM> (A Shot for Every Russian.) Several carloads of insect powder stood on one of the sidings, waiting to be shipped to the front.</P>
<p>
We stopped for a day in Vienna to get the necessary papers,
arrange our money affairs, and send a wire to Switzerland to get
someone to go surety for us to enable us to enter the
country. Greulich &#8211; a veteran member of the Swiss Social-Democratic
Party &#8211; went surety for us. In Vienna Ryazanov took Vladimir Ilyich
to see Victor Adler, who had helped to secure Ilyich's
release. Adler related his conversation with the Minister. "Are
you sure that Ulyanov is an enemy of the tsarist government?" the
Minister had asked. "Oh, yes," Adler had answered. "He is a more
implacable enemy than Your Excellency." From Vienna we travelled
to the Swiss frontier fairly quickly.</P>
