The Years of New Revolutionary Upsurge 1911-1914</h1>
<H4>Cracow 1912-1914</H4>
<hr class="end">
<BR>
<p>
Political-emigrant Paris or Switzerland. As a matter of fact,
it was only half emigration. In Cracow the chief interest of our
life,
practically speaking, was the work in Russia. Contacts with Russia were quickly established. Newspapers arrived from St. Petersburg in two or three days. At that time <EM>Pravda</EM> was being published in Russia. "And in Russia there is a <EM>revolutionary</EM> upsurge, not just any kind of upsurge, but precisely a <EM>revolutionary</EM> one," Vladimir Ilyich wrote to Gorky. "We succeeded alter all in setting up a daily <EM>Pravda</EM> &#8211; incidentally thanks to the very (January) conference which fools are barking at." 
The closest possible contacts were established with <EM>Pravda.</EM> Ilyich wrote articles for <EM>Pravda</EM> almost every day, sent letters there, followed its work, and recruited contributors for it. He urged Gorky to write for it. Zinoviev and Lilina wrote regularly, too, and the latter collected interesting foreign material for it. Such regular collaboration would have been inconceivable from Paris or Switzerland. Correspondence with Russia was also quickly established. The Cracow comrades taught us how to arrange this with the utmost secrecy. The thing was not to have a foreign cancellation-stamp on the letters. Then the Russian police would not take so much notice of them. Peasant women coming to the market-place from Russia would take letters across and post them in Russia for a small fee.</P>
<p>
There were about four thousand Polish emigrants from Russia living in Cracow.</P>
<p>
On our arrival there we were met by Comrade Bagocki, a Polish
political emigrant, who immediately took us under his wing and helped
us with all our domestic affairs and secret work. He taught us how
to use the polupaski (special passes issued to the local
inhabitants to enable them to cross and recross the frontier). These
polupaski cost very little, and the important thing was that they
greatly facilitated the work of our illegal comrades who travelled
back and forth with them. We sent many comrades across with these
polupaski. Varvara Yakovleva was one of them. She had escaped from
Siberian exile, where she had contracted tuberculosis, and gone
abroad to get medical treatment and see her brother in Germany. She
went back through Cracow, as arrangements had to be made for
corresponding and work. She got through safely. Only recently did I
learn that when crossing the frontier she attracted the attention of
the gendarmes by reason of the large suitcase which she carried. They
wanted to know whether she was really travelling to the place she had
booked her ticket to. The car attendant, however, warned her about
it, and offered to buy her a ticket to Warsaw for a tip. She did so,
and continued her journey without mishap. Once we sent Stalin across
with a polupaska. The thing was to answer promptly in Polish
jestem &#8211; "present" &#8211; when the name of the pass owner was called out at
the frontier. I remember trying to teach our comrades this little
trick. Soon we had this illegal crossing of the frontier properly
organized. On the Russian side the secret rendezvous were arranged
through Krylenko, who lived in Lublin at the time, not far from the
frontier. We used the same means for smuggling illegal literature
across. The police in Cracow gave us no trouble, and our mail was not
tampered with. Generally speaking, they had no contacts with the
Russian police. We had this brought home to us on one
occasion. Shumkin, a Moscow worker, came to us once for literature,
which he wanted to smuggle through in a special waistcoat made for
the purpose. He was a great one for secrecy technique, and used to
walk about the streets with his cap jammed down over his eyes. We
went to a meeting and took him with us. He did not walk with us,
though, and kept at some distance behind for safety sake. He looked
so patently conspiratorial that he attracted the attention of the
Cracow police. A police officer called on us the next day and asked
us whether we knew this man and could vouch for him. We said we
could. Shumkin nevertheless insisted on taking the literature,
although we tried to dissuade him, and smuggled it through
safely.</P>
<P>We had arrived in Cracow in the summer and Bagocki advised us
to take rooms in the Zweizynce suburb. We rented rooms in the same
house as the Zinovievs. It was a terribly muddy place, but the
Vistula was quite near and offered enjoyable bathing, while about
five kilometres away there was the Las Wolski, a vast beautiful
forest which Ilyich and I often went to on our bicycles. In the
autumn we moved to another part of the town, in a newly built
quarter, together with Bagocki and the Zinovievs.</P>
<p>
Ilyich liked Cracow very much. It reminded him of Russia. The
new surroundings and the absence of emigrant squabbles tended to
soothe his nerves. Ilyich closely observed the everyday life of
the Cracow population, its workers and its poor. I liked Cracow,
too. I had lived in Poland once when I was a child from the age of
two to five, and I had still retained some memories of it. I liked
the open wooden galleries in the courtyards; they reminded me of
those on whose steps I used to play with the Polish and Jewish
children; I liked the little gardens &#8211; ogr&oacute;diki, where they
sold kwasne mleko z ziemniakami (sour milk and potatoes). My
mother, too, was reminded of her young days. As for Ilyich, he was
glad to have escaped from Paris at last; he cracked merry jokes,
and praised both the kwasne mleko and the Polish mocna starka
(strong liquor).</P>
<p>
Lilina knew more Polish than any of us. I knew it poorly; I
remembered a little from my childhood days and had studied it a
bit in Siberia and Ufa, and now I was obliged to make immediate
use of the language along domestic lines. The housekeeping there
was much more difficult than in Paris. There was no gas, and we
had to light a wood fire in the kitchen. I tried asking for meat
without bones at the butcher's, the way they used to sell it in
Paris. The butcher looked at me and said: "The Lord God has
created cows with bones, so how can I sell you meat without
bones?" We had to stock up on leaves for Monday, because on
Mondays the bakers would be having their hangover and the bakeries
would be closed. One had to learn how to haggle. There were Polish
shops and Jewish shops. You could buy everything at the Jewish
shops at half the price, but you had to haggle there, pretend to
go away, then come back again, and so on. It was a shocking waste
of time.</P>
<p>
The Jews lived in a separate quarter of the town and dressed
differently. In the waiting room at the out-patient hospital, the
patients would seriously discuss whether a Jewish child was the
same as a Polish child or not, whether it was cursed or not. And a
little Jewish boy sat there listening to it all. The power of the
Catholic clergy in Cracow was boundless. The priests rendered
relief to the victims of fires, to old women and orphans, the
convents found employment for domestic servants and defended
their rights, and church services were the only recreation the
downtrodden ignorant population enjoyed. Feudal customs still
survived in Galicia, and the Catholic Church kept them alive. For
example, a lady would come to the market to hire a servant. A
dozen or so peasant women who had come to hire themselves as
servants would stand round the lady kissing her hand. Tips were
given everywhere. On receiving a tip, the carpenter or cabby would
drop on his knees and bow down to the ground. But then hatred of
their masters lived strongly in the masses. The nurse whom the
Zinovievs had hired for their little boy went to church every
morning, and was wan with fasting and praying. Nevertheless, when
I fell into conversation with her once, she told me how bitterly
she hated the masters; she had worked for an officer's wife once
for three years; like all ladies of the gentry, she slept till
eleven o'clock, took her coffee in bed, and made the servant dress
her and pull on her stockings. This fanatically religious nurse
said that if there was a revolution, she would be the first to go
against the gentry with a pitchfork. The poverty and downtrodden
state of the peasantry and the poor were apparent at every step,
and were much worse even than they were with us in Russia.</P>
<p>
In Cracow Vladimir Ilyich met Ganiecki, who had been a
delegate of the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania to
the Second, and then the Stockholm and London congresses of our
Party. He had been delegated by the Central Board. Vladimir Ilyich
learned the details about the split among the Polish
Social-Democrats from Ganiecki and other Polish comrades. The
Central Board had started a campaign against the Warsaw Committee,
which was backed by the whole Warsaw organization. The Warsaw
Committee had demanded of the Central Board a more principled
policy and a definite attitude towards the internal Party affairs
of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The Central Board
had dissolved the Warsaw Committee and begun to spread rumours
alleging that the latter was connected with the secret
police. Vladimir Ilyich sided with the Warsaw Committee (the
Rozlamowcy, as they were called). He wrote an article in their
defence, and sent a protest to the International Socialist
Bureau. The Warsaw Committee was closely connected with the masses
of Warsaw and other working-class centres (Lodz, etc.). Vladimir
Ilyich did not consider that they were fighting for some alien
interests; their cause had a very close bearing on the general
struggle within the Party, which was very acute at the
moment. Vladimir Ilyich, therefore, could not remain a mere
bystander. Russian affairs, nevertheless claimed his chief
attention.</P>
<p>
Lenin's close comrades, Safarov and Inessa, went to
St. Petersburg from Paris to make arrangements for the election
campaign. They travelled with other people's passports. Inessa
called on us in Cracow when we were still living in Zwiezynce. She
stayed with us for two days, and we went into all the details with
her and supplied her with all the addresses and connections. She
and Ilyich discussed the whole plan of work. Inessa was to call on
Krylenko on the way &#8211; he lived in Lublin, not far from the Galician
border &#8211; in order to organize through him the crossing of the
frontier by comrades bound for Cracow. Inessa and Safarov sent us
fairly detailed reports of what was going on in
St. Petersburg. They made contacts there and did a good deal
towards acquainting the workers with the resolutions of the Prague
Conference and the tasks which then confronted the Party. They set
up their headquarters in the Narva District. The St. Petersburg
Committee was re-established, and subsequently a Northern Regional
Bureau was formed, members of which, in addition to Inessa and
Safarov, were Shotman and his comrades Rahja and Pravdin. A sharp
struggle was going on in St. Petersburg against the
Liquidators. The activities of the Northern Regional Bureau
prepared the ground for the election of Badayev, a Bolshevik
railway worker, as deputy for St. Petersburg. The Liquidators
were losing influence among the working-class masses of
St. Petersburg; the workers saw that instead of fighting a
revolutionary struggle, the Liquidators were taking the way of
reform and actually pursuing a liberal-labour policy. An
irreconcilable struggle had to be waged against the
Liquidators. That is why Vladimir Ilyich was so upset when
<EM>Pravda</EM> at first persistently kept striking out of his
articles his polemics with the Liquidators. He wrote angry
letters to <EM>Pravda.</EM> Only gradually did <EM>Pravda</EM>
join in the struggle.</P>
<p>
The election of deputies in the worker curia in
St. Petersburg was fixed for Sunday, September 16. The police,
too, were preparing for the elections. Inessa and Safarov were
arrested on the 14th. But the police did not know yet that Stalin,
who had escaped from exile, had arrived on the 12th. The elections
in the worker curia passed off very successfully. Not a single
candidate of the Right went through, and everywhere resolutions of
a political character were passed.</P>
<p>
Throughout October all attention was focussed on the
elections. Traditionally and through ignorance, the working
class masses in a number of districts showed a lack of interest in
the elections and did not attach any importance to them. Wide
agitation was needed. Nevertheless, the workers everywhere elected
Social-Democrats. The elections in all the worker curiae of the
big industrial centres resulted in a victory for the
Bolsheviks. Party workers were elected who enjoyed great prestige
among the working class. Six Bolsheviks and seven Mensheviks were
returned to the Duma, but the six Bolshevik deputies represented a
million workers, whereas the seven Menshevik deputies represented
less than a quarter of a million. What is more, the Bolshevik
group at the very outset showed that they were better organized
and welded. The opening of the Duma on October 18 was ushered in
by workers' demonstrations and strikes. The Bolshevik deputies in
the Duma had to work together with the Mensheviks, although
internal Party relations between them had become very strained of
late.</P>
<p>
In January the Prague Conference took place. It played an
important part in organizing the Bolshevik forces.</P>
<p>
A so-called Party conference, sponsored by Trotsky, was
convened in Vienna at the end of August 1912. The avowed object of
this conference was to unite all Social-Democratic forces; the
fact that the ways of the Liquidators and the Bolsheviks had
sharply diverged and that the conduct of the Liquidators was
profoundly antagonistic to the Party line was completely
ignored. The <EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists were also invited to the
conference. As was to be expected, the conference was markedly
Liquidationist in character. The Bolsheviks grouped around the
Central Committee took no part in it, and even the Menshevik
Plekhanovites and Bolshevik conciliators grouped around
Plekhanov's journal <EM>Za Partiu (For the Party)</EM> (published
abroad), refused to attend it. The Poles did not take part in it
either, and Alexinsky, who went to the conference on behalf of the
<EM>Vperyod</EM> group, exposed the weakness of its
composition. The great majority of the conference delegates
were people who lived abroad; two Caucasians were delegated to it
from the Caucasian Regional Bureau, and on the whole all the
delegates were elected by very narrow bodies. The resolutions of
the conference were the quintessence of Liquidationism. The slogan
of a democratic republic was thrown out of the election platform
entirely, and the slogan of "revision of the agrarian
legislation of the Third Duma" was substituted for that of
"confiscation of the landowners' estates." </P>
<P>Boris Goldman (Gorev), one of the principal speakers, said that
the old Party no longer existed, and that the conference was to
become an "inaugural" one. Even Alexinsky protested against
this. This August unification, or August bloc as it was called,
set itself in opposition to the Central Committee and tried to
discredit the decisions of the Prague Conference. Under the guise
of unity of all Social-Democratic forces, a union against the
Bolsheviks was established.</P>
<p>
Meanwhile the workers' movement in Russia was growing. This was proved by the elections.</P>
<p>
Soon after the elections Muranov visited us. He had crossed
the frontier illegally. Ilyich was shocked. "What a scandal there
would have been if you had been caught," he told Muranov. "As a
deputy of the Duma you enjoy immunity, and there would have been
no harm if you had travelled legally. As it is there might have
been a scandal." Muranov told us many interesting things about the
elections in Kharkov, about his Party work, about how he
distributed leaflets through his wife, how she went to the market
with them, and so forth. Muranov was so well up in secrecy
technique that parliamentary immunity meant nothing to him. Ilyich
spoke to him about his future work in the Duma and urged him to go
back as soon as possible. Subsequently, the Duma deputies
travelled openly.</P>
<p>
The first conference with the deputies took place at the end
of December and the beginning of January.</P>
<p>
The first to arrive was Malinovsky. He was very excited, and
I did not like him very much at first. I did not like his eyes,
his free and easy manner, which was so obviously put on. The
impression wore off the very first time we talked business with
him. Then Duma deputies Petrovsky and Badayev arrived. They told
us about their first month of work in the Duma, and their work
among the masses. I can see Badayev, standing in the doorway,
waving his cap about and saying: "The masses have grown up these
last few years, you know." Malinovsky gave one the impression of
being a very intelligent and influential worker. Badarev and
Petrovsky, although somewhat shy, were obviously real dependable
proletarians. At this conference a plan of work was drawn up, and
the nature of the speeches to be delivered in the Duma and of the
work to be carried on among the masses was discussed with special
stress on the importance of closely linking this up with the work
of the Party, its illegal activity. Badayev was put in charge
of<EM> Pravda. </EM>Medvedev, who had come with the Duma deputies,
told us about his work in connection with the printing of
leaflets. Ilyich was very pleased. "Malinovsky, Petrovsky and
Badayev," he wrote to Gorky on January 1, 1913, "send you their
warm regards and best wishes." And added: "Cracow headquarters
have proved useful. Our moving to Cracow has proved a paying
proposition (from the point of view of the cause)." </P>
<p>
In the autumn, owing to the intervention of the Great Powers
in Balkan affairs, the war clouds began to gather. The
International Socialist Bureau organized protest meetings
everywhere. One such meeting was held in Cracow. It was a peculiar
one, though, being more like a hate meeting against Russia than
one of protest against war.</P>
<p>
The International Socialist Bureau held an emergency congress
of the Socialist International in Basle on November 11 and
12. The Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. was represented at the
Basle Congress by Kamenev.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich's indignation was aroused by an article by
Kautsky In <EM>Neue Zeit</EM>, an out-and-out opportunist
article, arguing that it would be a mistake for the workers to
organize armed uprisings or strikes against war. Vladimir Ilyich
had written a good deal about the organizing role of strikes
during the Revolution of 1905. After Kautsky's article he
dealt with the subject more thoroughly still in a number of
articles. He attached tremendous importance to strikes, as he did
to all forms of direct action by the working class.</P>
<p>
The question of war had been discussed at the Stuttgart
Congress in 1907, five years before the Basle Congress, and had
been decided in the spirit of revolutionary Marxism. Opportunism
had made tremendous headway during the intervening five
years. Kautsky's article was a striking illustration of this. The
Basle Congress, however, unanimously adopted a manifesto against
war, and a great anti-war demonstration was organized. The extent
to which the Second International was corroded by opportunism was
not revealed until 1914.</P>
<p>
During the Cracow period &#8211; in the years immediately preceding
the imperialist war &#8211; Vladimir Ilyich devoted a great deal of
attention to the national question. Ever since his youth he had
hated national oppression in every form. Marx's saying that there
could be no greater misfortune for a nation than to subjugate
another nation, was near and comprehensible to him.</P>
<p>
With war impending, the nationalist temper of the bourgeoisie
kept rising, and national hatred was fomented by it in every
possible way. The impending war meant oppression of the weak
nationalities and the suppression of their independence. But the
war &#8211; Ilyich had no doubts about that &#8211; would inevitably grow into
rebellion; the oppressed nationalities would fight for their
independence. It was their right. The International Socialist
Congress held in London in 1896 had confirmed that
right. Underestimation of the right of nations to
self-determination in the face of imminent war at such a
moment &#8211; the end of 1912 and beginning of 1913 &#8211; reused Vladimir
Ilyich's indignation. Instead of rising to the occasion and
high-lighting this issue, the August bloc passed a resolution to
the effect that cultural-national autonomy, [The demand for
cultural-national autonomy was put forward by the Bund in 1905 and
formulated in the following way: all functions connected with
questions of culture (public education, etc.) were to be withdrawn
from the jurisdiction of the state and the organs of local and
regional self-government and vested in the nation as represented
by special institutions &#8211; local and central &#8211; elected by all its
members on the basis of universal, equal, direct and secret
ballot. &#8211; N.K.] which had been a controversial issue as far back
as 1903 at the Second Congress of the Party and had then been
voted down, was allegedly compatible with the clause in the Party
programme dealing with the right of nations to
self-determination. This meant surrendering the position on the
national question, and confining the whole struggle to a fight for
culture only, as if it were not clear that culture and the whole
political system were bound together by a thousand ties. Ilyich
held this to be opportunism carried to extreme lengths. The
main dispute on the question of the right of nations to
self-determination was carried on with the Poles. They
contended &#8211; the Rozlamowcy as well as Rosa Luxemburg &#8211; that the
right of nations to self-determination did not imply the right to
secession. Ilyich understood the reason for the Poles' attitude on
the question of self-determination. The Polish masses hated
tsarism &#8211; this could be observed daily in Cracow. One man related
what his father had lived through during the Polish insurrection,
when he had barely escaped the gallows; another recalled how the tsarist authorities had desecrated the graves of his near and dear ones by turning pigs into the cemetery, etc., etc. Russian tsarism not only oppressed peoples, but mocked and humiliated them.</P>
<p>
With war on the horizon, there was a revival not only of
Black-Hundred nationalism and chauvinism on the part of the
bourgeoisie of the ruling states, but of the hopes of emancipation
of the oppressed nationalities. The Polish Socialist Party was
fired more and more by dreams of Polish independence. The
growing separatism of the P.S.P. &#8211; a party that was
petty-bourgeois to the core &#8211; caused alarm among the Polish
Social-Democrats. The latter, therefore, were opposed to
secession. Ilyich met members of the P.S.P., had several talks
with one of their prominent workers Iodko, and heard Daszyriski
speak. He was therefore able to appreciate the reasons for the
Poles' alarm. "But one cannot approach the question of the right
of nations to self-determination only from the point of view of
the Poles!" he said.</P>
<p>
The controversy on the national question, which had arisen as
far back as the Second Congress of our Party, flared up sharply on
the eve of the war in 1913-1914 and continued in 1916, during the
height of the imperialist war. Ilyich played a leading role in
these disputes; he went to the heart of the problem, and the
controversy was a useful one. It enabled our Party to find a
correct solution of the national question within the Soviet state,
to establish a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in which
inequality of nations and restriction of their rights are
unknown. We see in our country the rapid cultural growth of the
nationalities which formerly lived under unbearable conditions of
oppression, we see the ties being drawn ever closer and closer
between the nationalities of the U.S.S.R., united on a common
basis of socialist construction.</P>
<p>
It would be a mistake, however, to think that the national
question obscured from Ilyich during the Cracow period such
questions as the peasant question, to which he always attached
great importance. During the Cracow period Ilyich wrote over forty
articles on the peasant question. He wrote a complete paper for
Duma deputy Shagov "The Question of the (General) Agrarian Policy
or the Present Government" and a paper for G. I. Petrovsky "On the
Question of the Estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture." He
started a big work in Cracow based on a study of American
sources &#8211; "New Data on the Laws of Development of Capitalism in
Agriculture." America is famous for the precision and wealth of
its statistics. In this work Ilyich set out to refute the view of
Himmer (the name of the now notorious Sukhanov, involved in the
sabotage case).</P>
<p>
"Mr. Himmer," Vladimir Ilyich wrote, "is not a stranger, not
a casual author of a casual magazine article, but one of the most
prominent economists representing the most democratic, the extreme
left, <EM>bourgeois</EM> trend in Russian and European social
thought. It is precisely for this reason that Mr. Himmer's views
may become &#8211; and among the non-proletarian strata of the population
have already become to a certain extent &#8211; particularly widespread
and influential. For these are not his personal views, his
individual mistakes; they are the expression of <EM>common</EM>
bourgeois views &#8211; only particularly democratized, particularly
embellished with pseudo-socialist phraseology &#8211; which in the
conditions of capitalist society are most readily accepted by
official professors who follow the beaten track, and by those
small farmers who are distinguished among the millions of their
kind for their intelligence.</P>
<p>
"The theory of the non-capitalist evolution of agriculture in
capitalist society advocated by Mr. Himmer is in essence the
theory of the vast majority of bourgeois professors, bourgeois
democrats, and opportunists in the labour movement throughout
the world...." </P>
<p>
Started in Cracow, this booklet on American agriculture was
finished in 1915 but not published until 1917.</P>
<p>
Eight years later, in 1923, when Ilyich was already ill, he
scanned Sukhanov's notes about the revolution and dictated an
article on them which was published in <EM>Pravda</EM> under the
title of "Our Revolution." In this article he wrote: "And now
there can be no doubt that in the main we have been victorious."
Sukhanov had not realized this. Ilyich went on to say: "I have
lately been glancing through Sukhanov's <EM>Notes on the
Revolution.</EM> What strikes one particularly is the pedantry of
all our petty-bourgeois democrats, as of all the heroes of the
Second International. Apart from the fact that they are all
extraordinarily faint-hearted... what strikes one is their slavish
imitation of the past.</P>
<p>
"They all call themselves Marxists, but their conception of
Marxism is impossibly pedantic. They have completely failed to
understand what is decisive in Marxism, namely, its revolutionary
dialectics.... Their whole conduct betrays them as cowardly
reformists, who are afraid to take the smallest step away from the
bourgeoisie, let alone break with it." </P>
<p>
Further on Ilyich speaks about the imperialist world war
having created conditions "which enabled us to achieve precisely
that union of a 'peasant war' with the working-class movement
which no less a 'Marxist' than Marx himself had in 1856 suggested
as a possible prospect for Prussia?" </P>
<p>
Eight more years have passed since then. Ilyich is no longer
among the living. Sukhanov still does not see what conditions
for the building up of socialism the October Revolution has
created, and actively strives to prevent us from tearing up the
last roots of capitalism; he does not see how the face of our
country has changed. The collective farms and state farms are
being consolidated, harvester combines are turning up the virgin
soil, the old unploughed bound strips are becoming a thing of the
past, labour is being organized on new lines, and the very face of
agriculture has changed.</P>
<p>
In his numerous articles written during the Cracow period,
Ilyich covers a number of very important questions giving a
striking picture of the state of peasant and landlord farming,
describing the agrarian programme of the different parties,
exposing the character of the government measures, and calling
attention to a number of momentous problems, such as the settler
movement, wage labour in agriculture, child labour, the sale and
purchase of land, the concentration of peasant lands, etc. Ilyich
had a first-hand knowledge of the countryside and the 'peasants'
needs, and the workers and peasants always felt and saw this.</P>
<p>
The rising tide of the revolutionary workers' movement at the
end of 1912 and the role which <EM>Pravda</EM> played in that
movement were obvious to all, including the
<EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists.</P>
<p>
Alexinsky on behalf of the Paris group of the
<EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists made an offer of cooperation to the
<EM>Pravda</EM> editorial board in November 1912. He wrote a
number of articles for <EM>Pravda,</EM> and in No. 3 of the
<EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists' symposium <EM>Na Temi Dnya (Current
Topics),</EM> he even urged the necessity of calling off the fight
within the Bolshevik ranks and of forming a bloc of all Bolsheviks
for the purpose of combatting the Liquidators. The editorial
board of <EM>Pravda</EM> included in its list of contributors not
only the members of the Paris group to which Alexinsky belonged,
but also Bogdanov. Ilyich got to know of this only through the
press. It was characteristic of Ilyich that he was able to draw
the line between disputes on fundamental issues and squabbling and
personal grievances, was able to set the interests of the cause
above all else. Plekhanov might heap abuse on his head, but if the
cause required unity with him, Ilyich was not one to hold back.
Alexinsky might fight his way into a meeting of the group and
conduct himself disgracefully, but once he realized that it was
necessary to work wholeheartedly in <EM>Pravda,</EM> to fight the
Liquidators and stand up for the Party, Ilyich was well
pleased. One could cite dozens of examples like this. Ilyich hit
back hard when he was attacked, and defended his point of view,
but when new problems had to be tackled and it was found possible
to cooperate with his opponent, Ilyich was able to approach his
opponent of yesterday as a comrade. He did not have to make any
special effort to do this. Herein lay Ilyich's tremendous
advantage. Very guarded though he always was on matters where
principles were involved, he was a great optimist as far as people
were concerned. Despite an occasional error of judgement, this
optimism of his was, on the whole, very useful to the cause. But
where there was no agreement on matters of principle, there was no
reconciliation.</P>
<p>
In a letter to Gorky Ilyich wrote."I am wholeheartedly
prepared to share your joy at the return of the
<EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists provided that your supposition about
'Machism, God-building and all that stuff having gone for good,'
as you say, is really true. If that is so, if the
<EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists have realized this or will realize it now,
then I heartily share your joy at their return. But I emphasize
the 'if,' for so far this has been more a wish than a fact.... I
do not know whether Bogdanov, Bazarov, Wolski (the
semi-anarchist), Lunacharsky and Alexinsky are <EM>capable of
learning</EM> anything from the painful experiences of
1908-1911. Have they learned that <EM>Marxism </EM>is a much more
serious and profound thing than they had believed, that you cannot
scoff at it the way Alexinsky did, or slight it as a dead thing
the way the others did? If they have, then a thousand greetings to
them, and all the personal things (inevitably involved in acute
struggles) will go by the board in a twinkling. And if they have
not realized this, not learned anything, then don't blame
me &#8211; friendship is one thing, duty is another. Any attempt to throw
mud at Marxism or confuse the policy of the workers' Party will
make us light to the death.</P>
<p>
"I am <EM>very</EM> glad that a way has been found for a
gradual return of the <EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists through
<EM>Pravda</EM>, which did not hit them directly. I am very glad
But if this rapprochement is to be <EM>durable,</EM> we must go
about it slowly and <EM>cautiously.</EM> That is what I wrote in
<EM>Pravda.</EM> The friends who are anxious to bring about a
reunion between us and the <EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists should direct
their efforts towards this too. A careful return of the
<EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists (tested by experience), from Machism,
Otzovism and God-building, may do a devil of a lot of good. The
slightest carelessness and 'a relapse to the disease of Machism,
Otzovism, etc., may make the struggle flare up worse than
ever.... I have not read Bogdanov's <EM>Philosophy of Living
Experience;</EM> I suppose it is the same old Machism in a new
garb...." </P>
<p>
Reading those lines today brings up the whole path of struggle
against the <EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists in that period of profound
cleavage between 1908 and 1911. Now that that period was over,
Ilyich was completely absorbed in Russian work, carried away by
the rising tide of the movement. He could speak more calmly now
about the<EM> Vperyod</EM>-ists, but he hardly believed, if he
believed at all, that Alexinsky was capable of learning by
experience or that Bogdanov would cease to be a Machist. Things
turned out just as Ilyich had anticipated. Before long a sharp
conflict broke out with Bogdanov, who, under cover of supplying
a popular explanation of the word "ideology," attempted to smuggle
his philosophy into <EM>Pravda.</EM> The end of it was that
Bogdanov was crossed out of the list of <EM>Pravda's</EM>
contributors.</P>
<p>
During the Cracow period Vladimir Ilyich's mind was already
running on socialist construction. Of course, this can only be
said conditionally, since the direction which the socialist
revolution would take in Russia was not yet clear at the
time. Nevertheless, without the Cracow experience of
semi-emigration, when the leadership of the political struggle of
the Duma group came to grips with all the concrete problems of
economic and cultural activity, it would have been difficult,
during the period immediately following the October Revolution,
to tackle ail the essential aspects of Soviet construction in
their entirety. The Cracow period was a sort of preparatory class
for socialist construction. Naturally, the problems were posed in
bare outline, but they were so vital and real that they have lost
none of their significance to this day.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich devoted a good deal of attention at that time
to questions of culture. At the end of December arrests and
searches were made among the pupils of the Witmer gymnasium in
St. Petersburg This school, of course, was unlike the others of
its type. The head mistress and her husband took an active part in
the first Marxist circles formed in the nineties, and rendered
various services to the Bolsheviks in 1905-1907. In the Witmer
gymnasium no one was forbidden to go in for politics, organize
circles, etc. It was this gymnasium that the police raided. The
question of the students' arrests was raised in the Duma, and
the Minister for Education, Kasso, gave an explanation. His
explanation was rejected as unsatisfactory by a majority of
votes.</P>
<p>
In an article entitled "Growing Incongruity," written for
Nos. 3 and 4 of <EM>Prosveshchenie,</EM> Vladimir Ilyich pointed
out in Chapter X that the State Duma passed a vote of no
confidence in Kasso, the Minister of Education, in connection with
the arrests of the students of the Witmer gymnasium. This, he
said, was not the only thing the people ought to know. "The
people and democracy must know the <EM>motives</EM> for this vote
of non-confidence in order to <EM>understand</EM> the reasons of
things regarded as abnormal in politics, and to find a <EM>way
out</EM> to the normal." Ilyich goes on to examine the formulas
of the various parties for proceeding to the next business. He
examined the formula of the Social-Democrats, and writes:</P>
<p>
"This formula can hardly be regarded as faultless either. One
cannot help wishing it a more popular and comprehensive style of
exposition, one cannot help regretting that it does not mention
the legitimacy of engaging in politics, etc., etc.</P>
<p>
"But our criticism of <EM>all the formulas</EM> is in no way
directed against a particular style of editing; it is directed
exclusively against the <EM>basic political ideas</EM> of the
authors. A democrat should have said the main thing &#8211; that circles
and talks are <EM>natural and gratifying.</EM> That is the
point. Condemnation of political activity, albeit at an 'early
age,' is hypocrisy and obscurantism. A democrat should have raised
the question <EM>from</EM> that of a 'united cabinet' <EM>to</EM>
that of the political regime. A democrat should have pointed out
the 'indissoluble connection' first 'with the dominance of the
secret police,' secondly, with the dominance of the class of large
landowners of the feudal type in the economic life." Thus did
Vladimir Ilyich teach how to link up concrete questions of culture
with important political issues.</P>
<p>
Speaking of culture, Ilyich always emphasized the connection
between culture and the general political and economic system. He
severely criticized the slogan of cultural-national autonomy, and
wrote: "So long as various nations live in a single state they are
bound together by millions and billions of threads of an economic,
legal and social nature. How can school education be torn away
from these links? How can it be 'removed from the jurisdiction' of
the state, to use the classic and emphatic absurdity of the Bund
formula? If economics unite nations living in a single state, then
any attempt to divide them once for all in the sphere of
'culture,' and especially on school questions, is ridiculous and
reactionary. On the contrary, we should strive to <EM>unite</EM>
the nations in school matters, in order that the school may
prepare for what is carried out in life. At present we witness the
inequality of nations and dissimilarity in their levels of
development; under such conditions the division of school
education by nationalities will <EM>actually</EM> make it
inevitably <EM>worse</EM> for the more backward nations. In the
southern, former slave states of America. Negro children attend
separate schools to this day, while in the northern states white
and Negro children go to the same schools." In February 1913
Vladimir Ilyich wrote a special article "Russians and Negroes," in
which he tried to show how the ignorance and cultural backwardness
of one nationality affects the culture of another, how the
cultural backwardness of one class leaves its mark upon the
culture of the entire country.</P>
<p>
Vladimir Ilyich's remarks about proletarian policy in the
field of school education are extremely interesting. Protesting
against cultural-national autonomy and the removal of school
education "from the jurisdiction" of the state, he wrote: "The
interests of democracy, in general, and of the working class, in
particular, demand the exact opposite. We must strive to
<EM>bring</EM> the children of <EM>all</EM> nationalities
<EM>together</EM> in the <EM>same</EM> school of a given
locality. The workers of all nationalities must carry out
<EM>together</EM> the proletarian policy in school education that
was so well expressed by Samoilov, a deputy of the Vladimir
workers, on behalf of the R.S.D.L.P. group in the State Duma."
Samoilov had demanded the separation of the church from the state
and the school from the church; he had demanded the complete
secularization of the schools. Vladimir Ilyich also said that
facilities for the children of the national minorities to study
their own culture would easily be arranged under a real democracy,
when bureaucratism and "Peredonovism" [Peredonov-a gymnasium
teacher, a character in Sologub's novel
<EM>Little Demon</EM> typifying a vulgar sordid bureaucrat and petty tyrant, snob and sneaking cad.-N.K.] would be completely ousted from the schools.</P>
<p>
In the summer of 1913 Ilyich drafted a Duma speech for
Badayev "In Reference to the Policy of the Ministry of Education."
Badayev delivered it, but was prevented from finishing it by the
Chairman of the Duma.</P>
<p>
In this draft Ilyich cited statistical data showing the
unbelievable cultural backwardness of the country and the paltry
sums allocated for education. He showed that the policy of the
tsarist government barred nine-tenths of the population from
education. In this draft speech Ilyich wrote about "the
government's mean, shameless and disgustingly tyrannical treatment
of the teachers." He drew a comparison again with America. There
were 11 per cent of illiterates in America, and as much a 44
per cent among the Negroes. "But the American Negroes are <EM>more
than twice</EM> better off than the Russian peasants in respect of
"popular education." The Negroes in 1900 were more literate than
the Russian peasants because half a century before that the
American people had utterly defeated the American slaveowners. The
Russian people, too, should have overthrown their government in
order to make their country a literate, cultured country.</P>
<p>
In a speech drafted for Shagov, Ilyich wrote that the only
way for Russia to become a literate country was to give the
landowners' estates over to the peasants. In an article "What Can
Be Done for Education?" written at that period. Ilyich gave a
detailed account of library organization in America and urged the
necessity of doing the same job in Russia. In June he wrote his
article "The Working Class and Neo-Malthusianism," in which he
said: "We are fighting better than our fathers did. Our children
will fight still better, and <EM>they will win.</EM></P>
<p>
"The working class is not finished, it is growing, maturing,
becoming stronger, more united and enlightened, and hardened in
the struggle. We are pessimists as regards serfdom, capitalism and
small-scale production, but we are ardent optimists as far as the
working-class movement and its aims are concerned. We are laying
the foundations of the new edifice, and our children will complete
it." </P>
<p>
Ilyich was interested not only in questions of cultural
development, but in a number of other questions of practical
importance in socialist construction.</P>
<p>
Characteristic of the Cracow period were articles such as "A
Great Victory of Technics," in which Vladimir Ilyich compares the
role of great inventions under capitalism and under
socialism. Under capitalism, inventions go to enrich a handful of
millionaires, tending to worsen the general conditions of the
workers and increase unemployment. "Under socialism, the
application of Ramsey's system would 'emancipate' the toil of
millions of mining workers, etc., and would immediately make it
possible to reduce the eight-hour working day <EM>for all</EM>
workers from eight to, say, seven and even less
hours. 'Electrification' of all the factories and railways would
make the conditions of work more hygienic, would rid millions of
workers of dust, smoke and dirt, and quicken the process of
converting the filthy workshops into clean and airy laboratories
fit for human beings. Electric lighting and heating in all houses
would save millions of 'domestic drudges' from wasting
three-quarters of their lives in smelly kitchens.</P>
<p>
"Capitalist technics every day are steadily outgrowing the
social conditions, which condemn the working people to hired
drudgery." Eighteen pears ago Ilyich was thinking about
"electrification," a seven-hour day, kitchen-factories and the
emancipation of women.</P>
<p>
Ilyich's article "A Young Industry" shows him eighteen Years
ago pondering the problems and significance of automobile
developments Under socialism. In his article "Metals in
Agriculture," Ilyich described iron as "the iron
foundation of a country's culture." "We are all fond of chattering about culture, about the development of productive forces, about raising the level of peasant farming, etc.," he wrote. "But the moment the question is brought up of removing the barrier that prevents millions of impoverished, downtrodden, hungry, barefooted, neglected peasants from being 'raised,' our millionaires' tongues stick in their throats.... Our industrial millionaires prefer to share their medieval privileges with the Purishkeviches and sigh about liberating the 'muterlend' from medieval backwardness... ." </P>
<p>
Of especial interest, however, is Ilyich's article "The Ideas
of Advanced Capital." In this article he examined the ideas of an
American millionaire businessman by the name of Filene, who tried
to impress upon the masses that the employers were bound to become
their leaders, because they were learning ever better and better
to understand the community of interests between themselves and
the masses. Democracy was spreading, the strength of the masses
was increasing, the cost of living was rising. Parliamentarism and
the daily Press with its vast circulation were keeping the masses
increasingly well informed. The ideas of advanced capital were
designed to dupe the masses, make them believe that there was no
antagonism of interests between labour and capital, for the sake
of which they were prepared to go to a certain expense (by giving
office employees and skilled workers a share in the
profits). Having got to the bottom of these ideas of advanced
capital, Ilyich exclaims: "My most esteemed Mr. Filene! Are you
quite sure that the workers of the world are the simpletons you
take them for?" </P>
<p>
Written eighteen years ago, these articles show what problems
of construction Ilyich was interested in at the time, problems,
which, at the time the Soviet power was established, already
proved to be familiar ones; all that had to he done was to put in
effect ideas that had already been worked out.</P>
<p>
In the autumn of 1912 we made the acquaintance of Nikolai
Bukharin. Besides Bagocki, whom we saw pretty often, we received
visits at the beginning from Kazimierz Czapinski, a Pole who
worked on the Cracow newspaper <EM>Naprzod (Forward)</EM>. This
Czapinski told us a lot about the famous Cracow health resort
Zakopane, about the lovely mountains there and the wonderful
scenery, and incidentally mentioned that a Social-Democrat by the
name of 0rlov lived there, who made fine paintings of the Zakopane
mountains. Shortly after this we moved into town from Zwiezynce,
and looking through the window one day we saw a young fellow
coming up to the house with a huge canvas bag on his back. It
turned out to be Orlov &#8211; otherwise Bukharin. He and Ilyich had a
fairly long talk together. Bukharin lived in Vienna. We were in
close touch with Vienna ever since. The Troyanovskys lived there
too. When we asked Bukharin about his paintings he pulled a number
of splendid reproductions of German painters out of his bag. We
examined them with great interest. Some of the pictures were by
Boecklin. Vladimir Ilyich was fond of paintings. I remember how
surprised I was when Ilyich once brought home from Vorovsky's a
heap of illustrated write-ups of various painters over which he
spent hours in the evenings.</P>
<p>
We had lots of visitors in Cracow. Comrades going to Russia
used to call on their way to make arrangements about their
work. Nikolai Yakovlev, the brother of Varvara Nikolayevna, stayed
with us a fortnight once. He was on his way to Moscow to start the
Bolshevik paper <EM>Nash Put (Our Way)</EM>. He was a staunch and
reliable Bolshevik. Ilyich had long talks with him. Yakovlev got
the paper going, but it was soon suppressed and he was
arrested. This was not surprising, since the man who had "helped"
him start the newspaper was the Duma deputy from
Moscow &#8211; Malinovsky. The latter told us a great deal about his
tours of the Moscow Gubernia and the workers' meetings which he
had conducted. I remember him telling us about a meeting at which
a policeman had been present; the policeman had listened very
attentively and had been very obliging. In relating this incident
Malinovsky
had laughed. He told us a good deal about himself. One story was about how he came to volunteer for the Russo-Japanese War. During the recruiting a demonstration passed by, he said, and he couldn't resist making a speech from the window. He was arrested for it, and afterwards the colonel of the police spoke to him and said he would leave him to rot in jail or pack him off to a military convict gang unless he volunteered to join up. He had no alternative, Malinovsky said. He also told us that his wife was religious and when she found out that he was an atheist, she all but committed suicide; she suffered from nervous fits ever since. His stories sounded queer. No doubt there was a particle of truth in them. In talking about his past experiences, he held certain things back, omitted important points, and gave things a wrong twist.</P>
<p>
Later on I thought perhaps that recruiting story of his was
true, and maybe that was the reason why, on returning from the
front, he had had an ultimatum put to him &#8211; either to become an
agent provocateur or to go to prison. His wife was really under
great emotional stress, and had actually attempted suicide, but
the reason may have been something else &#8211; perhaps she suspected her
husband of being an agent provocateur. At any rate, Malinovsky's
stories were a mixture of truth and lies, and it was this that
made them sound so plausible. It never occurred to anyone at the
time that he was a police spy.</P>
<p>
Besides Malinovsky, the government took care to have a spy
on<EM> Pravda,</EM> too. He was Chernomazov. He lived in Paris,
and called on us in Cracow on his way to Russia, where he was
going to work on <EM>Pravda.</EM> We took a dislike to him, so
much so that I did not offer him to stay the night with us, and he
was obliged to walk the streets of Cracow all night. Ilyich
attached tremendous importance to <EM>Pravda.</EM> He sent
articles there almost every day, carefully counted up what
collections had been made for the paper and where, how many
articles had been written for it and on what subjects, etc. He was
very glad when the paper carried good articles and took the
correct line. Once, at the end of 1913, Ilyich asked
<EM>Pravda</EM> to send him its lists of subscribers, and my
mother and I sat right through the evenings for over a fortnight
cutting them up and sorting them out by towns and
villages. Nine-tenths of the subscribers were workers. Sometimes
you would come across a small town with a large number of
subscribers, and on looking it up, you would find that it
contained a big factory of which we had known nothing. This chart
of <EM>Pravda</EM> distribution turned out to be an interesting
one. It was never printed, however. Chernomazov must have thrown
it into the wastepaper basket. Ilyich had liked it very
much. Worse things than that happened, though. Sometimes &#8211; but not
often &#8211; Ilyich's articles got lost. At other times they were held
up and inserted only after some delay. Ilyich used to worry; he
wrote angry letters to <EM>Pravda,</EM> but that did not help
much.</P>
<p>
Not only people going to Russia called on us at Cracow. We
had visitors from Russia, too, who came to consult us on various
matters. I remember Krylenko arriving shortly after Inessa Armand
had visited him. He came to arrange closer contacts. I remember
how glad Ilyich was to see him. In the summer of 1913 Gnevich and
Dansky came to see us to make arrangements for publishing the
journal <EM>Voprosy Strakhovania (Insurance Questions)</EM>
under the auspices of the Priboy Publishing House. Ilyich attached
great importance to the insurance funds campaign, which he
believed would strengthen the Party's ties with the masses.</P>
<p>
A conference of Central Committee members was held in Cracow
in the middle of February 1913, to which our Duma deputies
arrived. Stalin arrived too. Ilyich had met Stalin at the
Tammerfors Conference and the Stockholm and London
congresses. This time Ilyich had long talks with Stalin on the
national question. He was glad to have met a man who was seriously
interested in that question and well informed on it.</P>
<p>
Previously Stalin had spent two months in Vienna, where he
had studied the national question. He had become closely
acquainted with our comrades there, notably Bukharin and the
Trovanovskys. After the conference Ilyich wrote to Gorky about
Stalin: "We have a wonderful Georgian here who is writing a long
article for <EM>Prosveshchenie,</EM> for which he has collected
all the Austrian and other materials on the subject." Ilyich was
worried about <EM>Pravda,</EM> and so was Stalin. They discussed
ways of putting things right. Troyanovsky, if I am not mistaken,
was invited to these talks. They talked about
<EM>Prosveshchenie. </EM>Vladimir Ilyich set great hopes on the
Troyanovskys. Elena Troyanovskaya (Rozmirovich) was preparing to
go to Russia. A scheme for the publication by <EM>Pravda</EM> of a
series of pamphlets was discussed. We had big plans.</P>
<p>
Just before this we had received a parcel from containing
various fish products &#8211; salmon, caviar and cured fillet of
sturgeon. I got Mother's cookery book out for the occasion and
made a pancake party. Vladimir Ilyich was tickled by the whole
affair &#8211; he loved to treat his comrades to good and satisfying
fare.</P>
<p>
On his return to Russia, Stalin was arrested in St. Petersburg on February 22.</P>
<p>
Life in Cracow was rather monotonous when there were no
visitors. "We are living here as if in Shushenskoye &#8211; from one mail
to another," I wrote to Ilyich's mother. "Until eleven o'clock we
manage somehow to pass the time, waiting for the first post, and
after that we have another long wait of six dreary hours."
Vladimir Ilyich found the Cracow libraries rather inconvenient to
work in. He started going in for ice-skating, but spring soon
came. At Easter we went for a walk in the Wolski
forest. Springtime in Cracow is lovely and in the woods it was
simply glorious. The bushes were a riot of yellow blossoms and the
trees were budding. The heady scents of spring were in the air. We
had a long walk back to town, and had to cross the whole city on
foot to reach home, as the trams were not running on account of
the Easter holidays. I felt quite done up. In the winter of 1913 I
felt rather low; my heart became tricky, my hands trembled, and I
suffered from general debility. Ilyich insisted on my going to see
a doctor. The doctor said my case was serious &#8211; my nerves and heart
were out of order as a result of goitre. He advised the mountains
of Zakopane. I came home and related what the doctor had said. The
charwoman &#8211; a cobbler's wife &#8211; waxed indignant. "Fancy saying you
have nerves! It's the rich ladies who have nerves and throw
crockery at your head!" I did not throw crockery about, but in the
state I was in I was hardly fit for work.</P>
<p>
We moved out to Poronino, seven kilometres from Zakopane, for
the summer together with the Zinovievs and the Bagockis with their
famous dog Zhulik. Zakopane was overcrowded and expensive;
Poroninn was simpler and cheaper. We rented a large summer house
together. It stood on high ground, some 2,300 feet above
sea-level, in the Tatra foothills. The air was wonderful, although
there were frequent mists and drizzling rains. But the view of the
mountains during clear spells was beautiful. We would climb to the
plateau near our house and feast our eyes on the snow-capped
summits of Tatra. Sometimes Ilyich would go to Zakopane with
Bagocki, and take long walks in the mountains with the local
comrades (Vigelev). Ilyich was terribly fond of hiking. The
mountain air did not do me any good, and I steadily got
worse. After consulting Bagocki (who was a neurologist), Ilyich
insisted on my going to Berne to be operated on by Kocher. We went
there in the middle of June, stopping over at Vienna, where we
visited the Bukharins. Bukharin's wife Nadezhda was ill in bed,
and he was obliged to look after the house and do the cooking. He
put sugar into the soup instead of salt while engaged in an
animated conversation with Ilyich about matters that Ilyich was
interested in and about our comrades who lived in Vienna. We met
several of them, and went for a ramble about the city. This large
charming city was a very pleasant contrast to Cracow. In Berne we
were taken charge of by the Shklovskys who made quite a fuss of
us. They rented a little house with a garden. Ilyich joked with
the younger girls and teased Zhenyurka. I was in the hospital for
about three weeks; Ilyich sat at my bedside half the day and spent
the rest of the day in the libraries. He read a great deal. He
even waded through a number of medical books on thyroid complaints
and jotted down notes for himself. While I was in the hospital he
visited Zurich, Geneva and Lausanne to read lectures on the
national question. He also lectured on the same subject in
Berne. After I came out of the hospital a conference of Party
groups abroad took place in Berne, at which the state of affairs
in the Party was discussed. I was to have spent another fortnight
after the operation convalescing in the mountains of Beatenberg on
Kocher's advice, but we got word from Poronino that a lot of
urgent business was waiting to be attended to, and a telegram was
received from Zinoviev, which induced us to go back.</P>
<p>
We stopped at Munich on the way. Boris Knipovich, a nephew of
Lydia Knipovich, lived there. I had known him since he was a
child, when I used to tell him fairy-tales. Four-year-old
blue-eyed little Boris used to climb up on my knees, put his arms
round my neck, and demand, "Krupa, tell me the story about the
little tin soldier." In 1905-1907 Boris was an active organizer of
Social-Democratic study-circles in the gymnasiums. In the summer
of 1907, after the London Congress, Ilyich had lived with the
Knipoviches in the country in Finland, at Styrsudd. Boris was a
gymnasium student at the time, but already took an interest in
Marxism, and lent an eager ear to Ilyich, knowing in what high
esteem his Aunt Lydia held Ilyich.</P>
<p>
Boris was arrested in 1911 and later deported abroad, where
he studied at the University of Munich. His first book <EM>The
Differentiation Among the Russian Peasantry</EM> was published in
1912. He sent a copy of it to Ilyich. Ilyich's letter to Boris
shows a keen interest in the young author "I read your book with
great pleasure," he wrote, "and I was very glad to see that you
were tackling something serious and important. A work of this kind
should enable you to test, deepen and strengthen your Marxian
convictions." Ilyich then went on to make several very tactful
remarks and suggestions as to method.</P>
<p>
Rereading this letter reminds me of Ilyich's attitude
towards inexperienced writers. He always went to the heart of the
matter, and considered in what way he could help to improve it. He
did this very tactfully, however, so that the writer was hardly
aware he was being corrected. Ilyich was really wonderful at
helping people in their work. For instance, wanting to ask someone
to write an article and not being sure whether that person would
do it properly, he would first draw him out on the subject,
unfold his own ideas, and get the person interested. After
sounding him out, Ilyich would suggest: "What about your writing
an article on the subject?" And the writer would not even have
noticed how helpful this preliminary discussion with Ilyich had
been to him, and he would use the latter's own turns of phrase and
expressions without being aware of it.</P>
<p>
We had planned to stay in Munich for a couple of days to see
what changes had taken place there since we lived there in 1902,
but as we were in a great hurry to get back we only stayed a few
hours and caught the next train out. Boris and his wife had come
to meet us, and we spent the time together in the Hof Br&auml;u
restaurant, which was famous for its beer. The initials "H.B."
inscribed on the walls and the beer mugs read N. V. in Russian,
and I laughingly deciphered them as <EM>Narodnaya Volya.</EM> We
Spent the whole evening with Boris in that <EM>Narodnaya
Volya</EM> place. Ilyich praised the beer with the air of a
connoisseur. He and Boris discussed class differentiation among
the peasantry, and we all talked about Uncle &#8211; Lydia Knipovich &#8211; who
was also seriously ill with the same thyroid trouble as I
had. Ilyich dashed a letter off to her there and then, urging her
to go abroad and be operated on by Kocher. We arrived in Poronino
at the beginning of August &#8211; the 6th, if I am not mistaken &#8211; to find
it still drizzling there. Lev Kamenev gave us the latest news
about Russia.</P>
<p>
A conference of members of the Central Committee had been
arranged for the 9th. <EM>Pravda</EM> had been suppressed
<EM>Rabochnya Pravda (Workers' Truth)</EM> started coming out, but
almost every number was confiscated. The strike wave was
mounting. Strikes had broken out in St. Petersburg, Riga,
Nikolayev and Baku.</P>
<p>
Kamenev moved into the rooms above ours, and in the evenings
after dinner he and Ilyich sat on for a long time in our big
kitchen discussing the news from Russia.</P>
<p>
Preparations were going forward for the Party conference
which became known as the "Summer Conference." It was held in
Poronino between September 22 and October 1. All the Duma deputies
arrived except Samoilov; others attending were two Moscow
electors &#8211; Novozhilov and Balashov, Rozmirovich from Kiev, Sima
Deryabina from the Urals, Shotman from St. Petersburg and
others. <EM>Prosveshchenie </EM>was represented by Troyanovsky,
and the Poles by Ganiecki and Domski and two other Rozlamowcy (the
influence of the Rozlamowcy at that time extended to the four
largest industrial centres of Warsaw, Lodz, Dabrowa and
Kalisz).</P>
<p>
Of the Duma deputies present I remember only Malinovsky. The
conference discussed the affairs of <EM>Rabochayn Pravda,</EM> of
the Moscow newspaper, of <EM>Prosveshchenie,</EM> the Priboy
Publishing House, and the tactics to be pursued at the forthcoming
cooperative and shop-assistants' congresses and other current
tasks.</P>
<p>
Inessa Armand arrived at the conference when it was half
through. Arrested in September 1912, she bad been kept in prison
under an assumed name in conditions that had seriously undermined
her health (she developed symptoms of tuberculosis). She had lost
none of the old energy, however, and threw herself into Party work
with all her usual zest. All our people in Cracow were delighted
to see her.</P>
<p>
In all there were twenty-two persons present at the
conference. It was decided to raise the question of convening a
Party congress. The Fifth London Congress had been held six years
ago, and since that time many changes had taken place. The growth
of the working-class movement made a congress imperative. The
questions before the conference were the strike movement,
preparation for a general political strike, the tasks of
agitation, the publication of a number of popular pamphlets, and
the inadmissibility of watering down the slogans calling for a
democratic republic, the confiscation of the land owners'
estates and the eight-hour day, in the course of agitation
work. The questions of conducting activities in the legal
societies and Social-Democratic work in the Duma were also
discussed. Of special significance were the decisions on the need
for securing equal rights for the Bolshevik and Menshevik groups
in the Social-Democratic group of the Duma, on the inadmissibility
of the Bolsheviks being voted down in the group by a majority of
one on the part of the "Seven," *[The Social-Democratic group in
the Fourth Duma consisted of thirteen members (not counting one
representative of the Polish Socialist Party Jagiello, who had no
vote), of whom six were Bolsheviks and seven Mensheviks. The
Bolshevik group consisted exclusively of workers and represented
the broad masses of the Russian proletariat, whereas the "Seven"
represented mostly the interests of the petty bourgeoisie and the
radical intelligentsia. The Mensheviks forced an advantage for
themselves out of this one-man majority by putting through their
own resolutions on all fundamental issues in the name of the whole
group. The "Six" demanded equal rights in making decisions on all
Duma questions. The Mensheviks refusing, the "Six" withdrew from
the united S.-D. group and formed a Russian Social-Democratic
group of their own. &#8211; N.K.] who represented the views of only a
negligible minority of the workers. Another important resolution
adopted was that on the national question which wholly reflected
the views of Vladimir Ilyich. I remember the arguments on that
question in our kitchen, the heat with which it was discussed.</P>
<p>
Malinovsky worried more than ever. He got drunk night after
night, became maudlin and complained that he was being treated
with suspicion. I remember Balashov and Novozhilov, the Moscow
electors, resenting his behaviour. They sensed a false note and
play-acting in the way he carried on.</P>
<p>
We stayed in Poronino for about another fortnight after the
conference. We took long walks, went once to Czarny Staw, a
mountain lake of remarkable beauty, and other places in the
mountains.</P>
<p>
That autumn all of us &#8211; -our entire Cracow group &#8211; were drawn
very close to Inessa. She was just brimming with vitality and
exuberant good spirits. We had known her in Paris, but the colony
there had been a large one, whereas in Cracow we lived together in
a small close and friendly circle. Inessa rented a room in the
same house where Kamenev lived. My mother was greatly attached to
her. Inessa often came to have a chat with her, or sit and
smoke. Things seemed cosier and more cheerful when Inessa was
there.</P>
<p>
We were completely absorbed by Party cares and affairs. Our
home life was more like that of students, and we were very glad to
have Inessa. During this visit of hers, she told me a great deal
about her life and her children, and showed me their
letters. There was a delightful warmth about her stories. Ilyich
and I went for long walks with Inessa. Kamenev and Zinoviev called
us the "gadding party." We used to go for long walks outside the
town, to the meadows &#8211; called blon in Polish. Inessa in fact took
the pseudonym of Blonina. She loved music, and persuaded us all
to attend the Beethoven concerts. She was a good musician herself
and played many Beethoven pieces very well. A particular favourite
of Ilyich's was the <EM>Sonate pathetique,</EM> and he always
asked her to play it. He loved music. Later, in Soviet times, he
would go to Tsyurupa's to hear that sonata played by some famous
musician. We talked a lot about literature &#8211; fiction, "What we are
really starved for here is fiction," I wrote home to Ilyich's
mother. "Vladimir knows Nadson and Nekrasov almost by heart, and
has read <EM>Anna Karenina</EM> &#8211; the only odd volume we
have &#8211; about a hundred times. We left our fiction library in Paris
(an insignificant part of what we had in St. Petersburg), and here
no Russian books are obtainable. We sometimes read with envy the
advertisements of second-hand book-dealers offering
twenty-eight volumes of Uspensky, or ten volumes of Pushkin,
etc. As luck would have it, Vladimir has taken a sudden liking to
belles-lettres. And he's such an out-and-out nationalist, too. You
couldn't get him to go and see the Polish painters for love or
money, yet he picked up an old catalogue of the Tretyakov Gallery
at a friend's place and very often buries himself in it." </P>
<p>
It was originally planned that Inessa was to remain in Cracow
and bring her children over from Russia. I had even gone with her
to look for rooms. Life in Cracow, however, was very secluded, and
reminded one a bit of Siberian exile. Inessa's energies, with
which she was
bubbling over at the time, found no outlet there. She decided to make the round of our groups abroad and deliver there a series of lectures before taking up her residence in Paris, where she was to organize the work of our Committee of Organizations Abroad. Before her departure we had long talks together about women's work. Inessa strongly urged that propaganda work be widely developed among the women workers and a special women workers' magazine be published in St. Petersburg. Ilyich wrote to his sister Anna about the necessity of such a magazine, which began to make its appearance shortly afterwards. Inessa eventually did a great deal towards developing work among working women, and devoted no little time and energy to the business.</P>
<p>
In January 1914 Malinovsky arrived in Cracow, and together
with Vladimir Ilyich, went to Paris, and thence to Brussels to
attend the Fourth Congress of the Lettish Social-Democrats, which
opened on January 13.</P>
<p>
In Paris Malinovsky delivered what Ilyich described as a very
able report on the work of the Duma group, while Ilyich delivered
a lengthy address on the national question. He also spoke at a 9th
of January commemoration meeting, and at a meeting of the
Bolshevik group in Paris in connection with the attempt of the
International Socialist Bureau to intervene in Russian affairs
with the aim of reconciliation and in connection with Kautsky's
speech at the December meeting of the International Bureau to the
effect that the Social-Democratic Party in Russia was
dead. This meddling in Russian affairs on the part of the
International Socialist Bureau worried Ilyich, who was afraid that
it would merely act as a drag on the growing influence of the
Bolsheviks in Russia. Ilyich sent a report to Huysmans concerning
the state of affairs in the Party. The Fourth Congress of the
Lettish Social-Democrats resulted in a victory for the
Bolsheviks. Among those who attended the congress were Berzins,
Lacis and Hermans. Ilyich spoke at the congress and appealed, to
the Letts to line up with the Central Committee. In a letter to
his mother Ilyich wrote that his trip to Paris had refreshed
him.</P>
<p>
"Paris is an uncomfortable place for anybody with modest means
to live in, and very tiring," he wrote. "But for a short visit or
a joy-ride there is no better or jollier city. It did me good."</p> 
<p>
In the winter, shortly after Vladimir Ilyich had returned
from Paris, it was decided to send Kamenev to Russia to run<EM>
Pravda</EM> and direct the work of the Duma group. Both
<EM>Pravda</EM> and the Duma group were in need of help. Kamenev's
wife came for him with their little son.</P>
<P>Kamenev's little boy and Zinoviev's son, Styopa, gravely
debated whether St. Petersburg was a city or Russia. Preparations
were made for departure. We all went to the station to see them
off. It was a cold wintry evening. Very little was said. Kamenev's
boy alone kept up a steady chatter. Everyone was wrapped up in
his own thoughts. Would Kamenev hold out long there, we
wondered. When would we meet again? How long would it be before we
went to Russia? Everyone was thinking about Russia, longing to be
back there. I used to dream of Nevskaya Zastava in my sleep. We
avoided the subject, although secretly it was on everyone's
mind.</P>
<p>
The first number of the popular magazine <EM>Rabotnitsa (Woman
Worker)</EM> came out in St. Petersburg on March 8, 1914. It cost
four kopeks. The St. Petersburg Committee issued leaflets on
Women's Day. Inessa and Sta&euml;l sent in articles for the
magazine from Paris, and Lilina and I from Cracow. Seven numbers
of this magazine were published. The eighth was to carry articles
on the forthcoming Socialist Women's Congress in Vienna, but that
issue never appeared &#8211; the war broke out.</P>
<p>
We planned to hold the Party congress at the same time as the
International Socialist Congress, which was to take place in
Vienna in August. We hoped that some of the delegates would be
able to come legally. As for the rest, we planned to organize the
crossing of the border en masse under the guise of an excursion
party. This plan was to be carried through by the Cracow
printers. In May we moved back to Poronino again.</P>
<p>
Kisilev, Glebov-Avilov and Anya Nikiforova were specially
assigned to conduct the campaign of preparation for the congress
in St. Petersburg. They came to Poronino to make arrangements
about it all with Vladimir Ilyich. On the day of their arrival we
sat for a long time on the slope near our country house, listening
to them talk about the work in Russia. They were all young people,
full of energy, and Ilyich took a liking to them. Glebov-Avilov
had been a pupil at the Bologna school, and was now a staunch
Leninist. Ilyich advised the visitors to go for a walk in the
mountains. As he was feeling indisposed, they went without him. On
their return, they gave us a humorous account of the climbing they
had done (they had climbed a very steep height), of how their
knapsacks had been a nuisance, and they had carried them in turns,
and how, when it was Anya's turn, all the passers-by had laughed
at them and advised her to carry her gentlemen friends as well
while she was at it.</P>
<p>
The nature of the agitation for the congress was decided
upon. Having received all the necessary instructions, Kiselev went
to the Baltic provinces, and Glebov-Avilov and Anya Nikiforova
went to the Ukraine.</P>
<p>
Romanov, an ex-pupil of the Capri school, who had become an
agent provocateur, arrived from Moscow too. I forget on what
pretext he came, but it was in connection with the forthcoming
congress. The secret police wanted all the information they could
get about it.</P>
<p>
Inessa had had her children over from Russia for the summer,
and lived in Trieste by the seaside. She was preparing a report
for the International Women's Congress, which was to be held in
Vienna at the same time as the International Socialist
Congress. She had work to do in other fields too. The
International Socialist Bureau planned a conference in Brussels
for the middle of June consisting of representatives of eleven
organizations of the R.S.D.L.P. of all trends in order to organize
an exchange of opinions there with the aim of establishing
unity. It was obvious, however, that things would be carried
further, that the Liquidators, the Trotskyists, the Bundists and
others would take this opportunity to limit the activities of the
Bolsheviks and bind them by a number of resolutions. The influence
of the Bolsheviks in Russia was growing. As Badayev pointed out
in his book <EM>The Bolsheviks in the State Duma,</EM> by the
summer of 1914 the Bolsheviks had a majority on the executives of
fourteen out of the eighteen trade unions that existed in
St. Petersburg. The biggest trade unions, including the
Metal-Workers' Union, which was the largest and most powerful in
St. Petersburg, were on the side of the Bolsheviks. The same ratio
existed among the workers' group of the insurance institutions. Of
the Insurance Fund delegates elected in St. Petersburg and Moscow,
thirty-seven were Bolsheviks and only seven Mensheviks, while in
the case of the all-Russian insurance institutions forty-seven
were Bolsheviks and ten Mensheviks.</P> 
<P>Election of delegates to the International Socialist Congress
in Vienna was organized on a broad scale. The majority of the
workers' organizations elected Bolsheviks.</P>
<p>
Preparations for the Party congress were making good headway
too. Beginning with the spring this campaign steadily gained
strength. "The task confronting us," Badayev writes, "during the
period preceding the congress  &#8211; namely, the consolidation and
extension of the local Party units, was largely fulfilled thanks
to the tremendous upsurge of the revolutionary movement in the
country during the past few months. The workers' swing towards the
Party increased; new cadres of revolutionary-minded workers joined
the Party organizations, and the work of the leading bodies showed
a steady improvement. In this connection, the forthcoming congress
and the questions on its agenda were assured of a heightened
interest on the part of the working-class masses of the Party."</p>
<p>
Badayev received considerable sums of money collected for the
organizing fund of the congress. He had already received a number
of mandates, draft resolutions, instructions, etc. He gives a
striking picture of how legal activities were linked with
illegal. "The summertime," he writes, "favoured the organization
of illegal meetings in the woods outside the city, where we were
more or less safe from police raids. When it was necessary to
call wider meetings, these were arranged under the guise of
country excursions supposedly sponsored by some educational
society. After riding out of St. Petersburg some twenty or
thirty versts we would strike off into the woods 'for a walk,' and
once there, we would post patrols to show people the way after the
password had been given, and then hold our meeting. Police spies
fairly swarmed around all the labour organizations, paying
particular attention to the editorial offices of <EM>Pravda</EM>
and our group premises, which were known to be the centres of
Party work. But while the secret police increased their activity,
our own secrecy technique steadily improved as well. Of course,
comrades were still being arrested, but there were no big and
disastrous breakdowns." </P>
<P>Thus, the line adopted by the Central Committee aimed at
increasing legal publications, and giving the legal press a
definite angle towards developing the work of the Duma group
inside and outside of the Duma, towards framing all questions in a
clear and definite manner and combining legal with illegal work,
proved to be absolutely correct.</P>
<p>
The attempt to override this policy through the International
Socialist Bureau made Ilyich furious. He decided not to go to the
Unity Conference in Brussels, but to send Inessa instead. She knew
French well (it was her mother tongue), was able to keep a cool
head, and had plenty of character. She could be depended upon not
to surrender positions. Inessa lived in Trieste, and Ilyich sent
her the report of the Central Committee which he had drafted,
together with instructions how she was to act in particular
circumstances. He thought out every detail. The delegation of the
Central Committee, in addition to Inessa, consisted of
M. F. Vladimirsky and N. F. Popov. Inessa read out the report of
the C.C. in French. As was to be expected, things went beyond a
mere exchange of opinions at the conference. Kautsky, on behalf of
the Bureau, submitted a motion condemning the split and declaring
that no serious differences existed. All voted for the resolution
except the delegates of the Central Committee and the Letts. The
latter refused to vote in spite of Huysmans' threat that he would
report to the Vienna Congress that those who did not vote were
taking upon themselves the responsibility for side-stepping the
attempt to bring about unity.</P>
<p>
At a private meeting in Brussels the Liquidators, Trotskyists,
<EM>Vperyod</EM>-ists, Plekhanovists and the Caucasian regional
organization formed a bloc against the Bolsheviks, and decided to
take advantage of the situation to bring pressure to bear on the
Bolsheviks.</P>
<p>
Another very painful affair that completely absorbed Ilyich in
the summer of 1914 besides this Brussels unity business was the
Malinovsky affair.</P>
<p>
When General Junkovsky, the newly appointed Deputy Minister
of the Interior, discovered the role of agent provocateur that
Malinovsky was playing, he reported it to Rodzyanko, the Chairman
of the Duma, with a view to preventing a grave political
scandal.</P>
<p>
On May 8 Malinovsky handed Rodzyanko his resignation from the
Duma and left the country. The local and central Party
organizations condemned Malinovsky's action as being anarchistic
and disruptive, and expelled him from the Party. As for the charge
of being a police spy, this seemed to be so monstrous at the time,
that the Central Committee appointed a special commission of
enquiry under the chairmanship of Ganiecki, with Lenin and
Zinoviev as members.</P>
<P>Rumours that Malinovsky was an agent-provocateur had been
creeping about for a long time. These rumours originated in
Menshevik circles. Elena Rozmirovich had strong suspicions of him
in connection with her arrest &#8211; she had been working for the Duma
group, and the gendarmes who interrogated her were informed of
details which only an inside agent could have supplied them
with. Bukharin, too, had heard various reports about
Malinovsky. Vladimir Ilyich thought it utterly incredible that
Malinovsky could be an agent-provocateur. Only once did a
fleeting suspicion cross his mind. I remember once in Poronino, as
we were returning from the Zinovievs and talking about these
sinister rumours, Ilyich suddenly stopped on the bridge we were
crossing and said: "What if they are true!" A look of
dismay showed on his face. "That's impossible," I
answered. Reassured, Ilyich fell to cursing the Mensheviks, who
had no scruples as to the means they used in fighting the
Bolsheviks. He had no further doubts on this score.</P>
<p>
The commission of enquiry investigated all the rumours about
Malinovsky received Burtsev's statement to the effect that he
considered the charge improbable, considered the evidence of
Bukharin and Rozmirovich, but could not establish Malinovsky's
guilt.</P>
<p>
Malinovsky hung around in Poronino, feeling utterly miserable
and lonely. God knows what he must have lived through during that
time. Then he disappeared from Poronino. No one knew where he had
gone to. The February Revolution showed him up in his true
colours.</P>
<p>
He returned to Russia of his own free will after the October
Revolution and gave himself up to the Soviet authorities. He was
sentenced to death by the Supreme Tribunal and shot.</P>
<p>
Meanwhile, in Russia the struggle was becoming more acute. The
strike movement was building up, particularly in Baku. The working
class supported the Baku strikers. The police opened fire on a
crowd of 12,000 Putilov workers gathered at a meeting in St.
Petersburg. Clashes with the police assumed a more violent
character. The Duma deputies were becoming leaders of the
rising proletariat. Mass strikes became the order of the day.</P>
<p>
A hundred and thirty thousand workers came out on strike in
St. Petersburg on July 7. The strike grew in intensity rather than
waned. Barricades were erected on the streets of red
St. Petersburg.</P>
<p>
But war broke out.</P>
<p>
Germany declared war on Russia on August 1, on France on
August 3, and on Belgium on August 4. On the same day Britain
declared war on Germany. On August 6 Austria-Hungary declared war
on Russia, and on August 11 France and Britain declared war on
Austria-Hungary.</P>
<p>
It was the beginning of the world war, which temporarily
checked the rising revolutionary movement in Russia, turned the
whole world upside down, precipitated a number of grave crises,
gave new and much sharper emphasis to vital issues of the
revolutionary struggle, accentuated the role of the proletariat as
the leader of all the working people, roused new strata to the
struggle, and made the victory of the proletariat a question of
life or death for Russia.</P>
