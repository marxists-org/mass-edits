<hr />
<p>OWING to the backwardness of industry in Russia, the workers'
movement only began to develop in the nineties, when the revolutionary
struggle of the working class was already taking place in a number of
other countries. There had already been the experience of the great
French Revolution, the experience of the revolution of 1848, the
experience of the Paris Commune in 1871. The great ideological leaders
of the workers' movement-Marx and Engels-were forged out in the fire of
the revolutionary struggle. The teachings of Marx showed the direction
taken by social development, the inevitability of the disintegration of
capitalist society, the replacement of this society by Communist
society, the paths which will be taken by the new social forms, the
path of the class struggle; they disclosed the role of the proletariat
in this struggle, and the inevitability of its victory.</p>


<p>Our workers' movement developed under the banner of Marxism.
It did not grow blindly, groping its way, but its aim and its path were
plain.</p>


<p>Lenin did a tremendous amount to illuminate the path of
struggle of the Russian proletariat with the light of Marxism. Fifty
years have passed since the death of Marx, but for our Party Marxism is
still the guide to action. Leninism is merely a further development of
Marxism, a deepening of it.</p>


<p>It is therefore obvious why it is of so great an interest to
illuminate the question of Lenin's study of Marx.</p>


<p><em>Lenin had a wonderful knowledge of Marx</em>.
In 1893, when he came to St. Petersburg, he astonished all of us who
were Marxists at the time with his tremendous knowledge of the works of
Marx and Engels.</p>


<p>In the nineties, when Marxist circles began to be formed, it
was chiefly the first volume of "Capital" which was studied. It was
possible to obtain "Capital," although with great difficulties. But
matters were extremely bad with regard to the other works of Marx. Most
of the members of the circles had not even read the "Communist
Manifesto." I, for example, read it for the first time only in 1898, in
German, when I was in exile.</p>


<p>Marx and Engels were absolutely prohibited. It is sufficient
to mention that in 1897, in his article "The Characteristics of
Economic Romanticism" written for the <em>New Word</em>,
Lenin was compelled to avoid using the words "Marx" and "Marxism." and
to speak of Marx in a roundabout way so as not to get the journal into
trouble.</p>


<p>Lenin understood foreign languages, and he did his best to dig
out everything that he could by Marx and Engels in German and French.
Anna. Ilyinishna tells how he read "The Poverty of Philosophy" in
French together with his sister, Olga. He had to read most in German.
He translated into Russian for himself the most important parts of the
works of Marx and Engels which interested him.</p>


<p>In his first big work, published illegally by him in 1894,
"Who are the Friends of the People?" there are quotations from the
"Communist Manifesto," the "Critique of Political Economy," the
"Poverty of Philosophy," "German Ideology," "The Letter of Marx to Ruge
" in 1843, Engels' books "Anti-Dühring" and "The Origin of the Family,
Private Property and the State."</p>


<p>The "Friends of the People " tremendously widened the Marxist
outlook of the majority of the then Marxists, who as yet had very
little acquaintance with the works of Marx. It dealt with a number of
questions in an entirely new way and was tremendously successful.</p>


<p>In the next work of Lenin, "The Economic Content of the
Teachings of the Narodniki and a Criticism of Them in the Book of
Struve" we find already references to "The Eighteenth Brumaire" and the
"The Civil War in France," to the "The Criticism of the Gotha
Programme" and the second and third volumes of "Capital."</p>


<p>Later, life in emigration made it possible for Lenin to become
acquainted with all the works of Marx and Engels and to study them.</p>


<p>The biography of Marx written by Lenin in 1914 for "Granat':
Encyclopaedia" illustrates better than anything else the wonderful
knowledge of the works of Marx by Lenin.</p>


<p>This is also shown by the innumerable extracts from Marx which
Lenin constantly made when reading his works. The Lenin Institute has
many notebooks with extracts from Marx.</p>


<p>Lenin used these extracts in his work, read them over and over
and made notes on them. <em>Lenin not only knew Marx, but he
also thought deeply on all his teachings</em>. In his speech at
the Third All-Russian Congress of the Y.C.L. in 1920, Lenin said to the
youth that it was necessary "to take the whole sum of human knowledge
and to take it in such a way that Communism will not be something
learned by heart but something which you have thought out yourselves,
something which forms the inevitable conclusion from the point of view
of modern education." (Volume XXV.) "If a Communist were to boast of
Communism on the basis of ready-made conclusions, without doing
serious, big and difficult work, without thoroughly understanding the
facts towards which he must take a critical attitude, such a Communist
would be a very poor one." (Volume XXV.)</p>


<p>Lenin not only studied the works of Marx but he studied what
was written about Marx and Marxism by the opponents from the camp of
the bourgeoisie and the petty-bourgeoisie. In a polemic with them he
explains the basic positions of Marxism.</p>


<p>His first big work was "Who are the Friends of the People" and
how they fight against the Social-Democrats (a reply to an article in
"Russian Wealth" against the Marxists), where he drew a contrast
between the point of view of the Narodniki (Mikhailovsky, Krivenko,
Yushakova) and the point of view of Marx.</p>


<p>In the article, "The Economic Content of the Teachings of the
Narodniki, and the Criticism of Them in the Works of Struve," he
pointed out in what way the point of view of Struve was different from
the point of view of Marx.</p>


<p>When examining the agrarian question, he wrote a book, "The
Agrarian Question and the Criticism of Marx" (Volume IV.), where the
petty-bourgeois point of view of the Social-Democrats David, Hertz, and
the Russian critics, Chernov and Bulgakov was contrasted with the point
of view of Marx.</p>


<p>"<em>De choc des opinions jaillit la verite</em>"
(Truth arises from a conflict of opinions), says the French proverb.
Lenin loved to carry it out. He constantly brought to light and
contrasted class points of view on the basis of the questions of the
workers' movement.</p>


<p><em>It is very characteristic how Lenin set forth
various points of view side by side</em>. A great deal of light
is thrown on this by Volume XIX. or works, where the extracts,
conspects, plans for essays, &amp;c., on the agrarian question for
the period preceding 1917 are collected.</p>


<p>Lenin carefully recapitulates the <em>statements of the
" critics,"</em> selects and copies out the clearest and most
characteristic phrases and counter-poses them to the statements of
Marx. In carefully analysing the statements of the " critics," he tries
to show the class essence of their statements, putting forward the most
important and urgent questions in prominent relief.</p>


<p>Lenin very frequently <em>deliberately sharpened a
question</em>. He considered that the tone was not the important
thing. You may express yourself coarsely and bitingly. What is
important is that you speak to the point. In the preface to the
correspondence of F. A. Sorge, he gives a quotation from Mehring from
his Correspondence with Sorge : " Mehring is right in saying that Marx
and Engels gave little thought to a ' high tone.' They did not stop
long to think before dealing a blow, but they did not whine about every
blow they received." (Volume XI.) Incisiveness of form and style were
natural to Lenin. He learned it from Marx. He says "Marx relates how he
and Engels fought constantly against the miserable conducting of this
"Social-Democrat" and often fought <em>sharply (wobei oft scharf
hergeht)</em> (Volume XI.). Lenin did not fear sharpness, but he
demanded that objections should be to the point. Lenin had one
favourite word which he frequently used: " quibbling." If a polemic
began which was not to the point, if people began to pick at trifles or
juggle with facts, he used to say: "that is mere quibbling." Lenin
expressed himself with still greater force against polemics which had
not the aim of bringing clearness into the question but of paying off
small factional grudges. This was the favourite method of the
Mensheviks. Concealing themselves behind quotations from Marx and
Engels, taken out of their context, out of the circumstances in which
they were written, they served factional aims entirely. In the preface
to the correspondence of F. A. Sorge, Lenin wrote: " To imagine that
the advice of Marx and Engels to the Anglo-American workers' movement
can be simply and directly adapted to Russian conditions means to
utilise Marxism, not to elucidate his method, not to study the concrete
historic peculiarities of the workers' movement in definite countries,
but for petty factional grudges of the intelligentsia." (Volume XI.)</p>


<p>Here we arrive directly at the question of <em>how
Lenin studied Marx</em>. This can partly be seen from the
previous quotation: It is necessary to elucidate the method of Marx, to
learn from Marx how to study the peculiarities of the workers' movement
in definite countries. Lenin did this. For Lenin the teachings of Marx
were a guide to action. He once used the following expression: "Who
wants to consult with Marx ? " . . . It is a very characteristic
expression. He himself constantly "consulted with Marx." At the most
difficult turning points of the revolution, he once again turned to the
reading of Marx. Sometimes when you went into his room, when everyone
around was excited, Lenin was reading Marx and could hardly tear
himself away. It was not to quieten his nerves, not to arm himself with
belief in the power of the working class, belief in its ultimate
victory. Lenin had sufficient of this faith. He buried himself in Marx
so as to "consult" with Marx, to find a reply from him to the burning
questions of the workers' movement. In the article "F. Mehring, on the
Second Duma," Lenin wrote : "The argumentation of such people is based
on a poor selection of quotations. They take the general position on
the support of the big bourgeoisie against the reactionary
petty-bourgeoisie and without criticism adapt it to the Russian Cadets
and the Russian Revolution. Mehring gives these people a good lesson. <em>Anyone
who wants to consult with Marx</em> (my italics, N.K.) on the
tasks of the proletariat and the bourgeois revolution must take the
reasoning of Marx which apply <em>precisely</em> to the
epoch of the German bourgeois revolution. It is not for nothing that
our Mensheviks so fearfully avoid this reasoning. In this reasoning we
see the fullest and clearest expression of the merciless struggle
against the <em>conciliatory</em> bourgeoisie which was
carried on by the Russian 'Bolsheviks' in the Russian revolution."
(Volume XI.)</p>


<p>Lenin's method was to take the works of Marx dealing with a <em>similar
situation</em> and carefully analyse them, compare them with the
current moment, discovering resemblances and differences. The
adaptation to the revolution of 1905 to 1907 illustrates best of all,
how Lenin did this.</p>


<p>In the pamphlet, "What is to be Done? " in 1902, Lenin
wrote&nbsp;</p>


<p class="indentb">"History now puts before us an
immediate task which is the <em>most
revolutionary</em> of all the <em>immediate</em>
tasks of the proletariat of any other country. The carrying out of this
task the destruction of the most powerful support not only for European
but also (we may now say) Asiatic reaction would make the Russian
proletariat the vanguard of the international revolutionary
proletariat." (Volume IV.)</p>


<p>We know that the revolutionary struggle of 1905 raised the
international role of the Russian working class, while the overthrow of
the Tsarist Monarchy in 1917, really made the Russian proletariat into
the vanguard of the international revolutionary proletariat, but this
took place only 15 years after "What is to be Done?" was written. When
in 1905, after the shooting of the workers on January 9th, the
revolutionary wave from the Dvortsoff Square began to rise higher and
higher, the question urgently arose as to where the Party must lead the
masses, what policy it must follow. And here Lenin consulted with Marx.
He quotes with special, attention the works of Marx dealing with the
French and German bourgeois democratic revolutions of 1848: "The Class
Struggle of 1848-50" and the third volume of The Literary Heritage of
Marx and Engels," published by F. Mehring and dealing with the German
revolution.</p>


<p>In June-July, 1905, Lenin wrote a pamphlet, "The. Two Tactics
of Social-Democracy and the Democratic Revolution," where the tactic of
the Mensheviks, who took the line of conciliation with the liberal
bourgeoisie was contrasted to the tactics of the Bolsheviks, who called
on the working class to carry on a most determined and irreconcilable
struggle against the Monarchy to the point of armed rebellion.</p>


<p>It was necessary to put an end to Tsarism, wrote Lenin in "Two
Tactics." "The conference (of the New Iskra-ites) also forgot that as
long as the power remains in the hands of the Tsar, any decisions of
any representatives remain empty talk and just as pitiful as the
'decisions' of the Frankfurt parliament which are famous in the history
of the German Revolution of 1848. For this very reason Marx, in the <em>Neue
Rheinische</em> <em>Zeitung,</em>
mercilessly poured sarcasm on the liberal Frankfurt 'liberators'
because they spoke excellent words, adopted all kinds of democratic
'decisions,' 'established' all kinds of freedom, but in reality left
the power in the hands of the Monarchy, and did not organise the armed
struggle against the troops of the monarchy. And while the Frankfurt
liberators chattered, the monarchy bided its time, strengthened its
military forces, and counter-revolution, relying on real force,
overthrew the democrats with all their beautiful decisions." (Volume
VIII.)</p>


<p>Lenin raises the question whether it would be possible for the
bourgeoisie to destroy the Russian Revolution by an agreement with
Tsarism, "or," as Marx said at one time, "settling with Tsarism in a
'plebeian' manner." "When the revolution decisively conquers, we shall
settle with Tsarism in a Jacobine, or if you will, in a plebeian,
manner." The whole of French terrorism, wrote Marx in the famous <em>Neue
Rheinische Zeitung</em> in 1848, was nothing else but
the plebeian manner of settling with the enemies of the bourgeoisie
with absolutism, feudalism, respectability. (See Marx's Literary
Heritage -- published by Mehring.)</p>


<p>Did those people who frightened the Social-Democratic Russian
workers with the bogey of "Jacobinism" in the epoch of the democratic
revolution ever think of the meaning of these words of Marx ? (Volume
VIII.)</p>


<p>The Mensheviks said that their tactics were "to remain the
Party of the extreme revolutionary opposition." And that this did not
exclude partial seizures of power from time to time and the formation
of revolutionary communes in one town or another. What do
"revolutionary communes" mean, asks Lenin, and replies:</p>


<p class="indentb">The confusion of revolutionary thought
leads them (the new
Iskra-ites), as often happens, <em>to <sub>.</sub>revolutionary
phrases</em>.The use of the words, "Revolutionary commune" in the
resolution of representatives of social-democracy is a revolutionary
phrase and nothing more. Marx more than once condemned such phrases,
when the tasks of the future are concealed behind soothing terms of the
<em>dead past.</em> The fascination of terms which have
played a rôle in history is converted in such cases into an empty and
harmful tinsel, into a rattle. We must give to the workers and to the
whole people a clear and unmistakeable idea of <em>why</em>
we want to establish a provisional revolutionary government, <em>what
changes exactly</em> we shall carry out if we
decisively influence the power, even to-morrow, if the national revolt
which has commenced is victorious. These are the questions which face
the political leaders. (Volume VIII.)</p>


<p class="indentb">These vulgarisers of Marxism never gave
thought to the words
of Marx on the necessity of replacing the weapon of criticism by
criticism with weapons. Using the name of Marx everywhere, they in
reality draw up a tactical resolution entirely in the spirit of the
Frankfurt bourgeois cacklers, freely criticising absolutism, deepening
democratic consciousness, and not understanding that the time of
revolution is a time of action, above and below. (Volume VIII.</p>


<p class="c1">"Revolutions are the locomotives of
history," says Marx. By this reference to Marx, Lenin appraises the
role of the revolution that was breaking out.</p>


<p>In his further analysis of the sayings of Karl Marx in the <em>Neue
Rheinische Zeitung</em>, Lenin makes clear what the revolutionary
democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry means. But in
drawing the analogy, Lenin dwells also on the question in what way our
bourgeois democratic revolution differs from the German bourgeois
democratic revolution of 1848. He says:</p>


<p class="indentb">Thus it was only in April, 1849, after
the revolutionary
newspaper, <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> (which had
been published since June 1, 1848) had existed almost a year, that Marx
and Engels expressed themselves in favour of a separate labour
organisation. Hitherto they simply conducted the "organ of democracy,"
which was not connected by any organisational link with an independent
labour party. This fact -- monstrous and improbable from our
contemporary point of view -- shows us clearly what an enormous
difference there was between the then German and the present Russian
social-democratic Labour Party. This fact shows us how much weaker
(owing to the backwardness of Germany in 1848, economically and
politically -- absence of state unity) were the proletarian features of
the movement in the German democratic revolution, the proletarian
streak in it.</p>


<p>Particularly interesting are Vladimir Ilyitch's articles which
refer to 1907 and are devoted to the correspondence and activity of
Marx.</p>


<p class="c1">They are "The Foreword to the Translation of
Marx's Letters to K.L. Kugelmann," "Mehring on the Second Duma," and
"The Foreword to the Letters to F.A. Sorge." These articles throw a
particularly vivid light on the method by which Lenin studied Marx. The
last article is of exceptional interest. It was written in the period
when Lenin had taken up once more seriously the study of philosophy, in
connection with his divergencies with Bogdanov, when the issues of
dialectical materialism called for his special attention.</p>


<p>While studying simultaneously also the sayings of Marx that
referred to questions analogous to those which sprang up among us in
connection with the breakdown of the revolution, and questions of
dialectical and historical materialism, <em>Lenin learned from
Marx how to <sub>.</sub>apply to the study</em> <em>of
historical development the method of dialectical materialism</em>.</p>


<p>In the "Foreword to the Correspondence with F.A. Sorge" he
wrote:</p>


<p class="indentb">"A comparison of what Marx and Engels
had to say on questions of
the Anglo-American and German labour movements is very instructive. If
one takes into consideration that Germany, on the one hand, and Great
Britain and America, on the other, represent different stages of
capitalist development, different forms of the rule of the bourgeoisie
as a class in the whole political life of these countries, the said
comparison assumes special significance. From the scientific pointof
view we have here a sample of materialist dialectic, ability to bring
forward and emphasise different points, different sides of the question
in their application to the concrete peculiarities of various political
and economic conditions. From the point of view of practical politics
and tactics of the worker's party, we have here a sample of the manner
in which the creators of the "Communist Manifesto" defined the task of
the struggling proletariat as applied to the various phases of the
national labour movement of the various countries" (free translation).</p>


<p>The revolution of 1905 brought to the fore a whole series of
new essential questions during the solution of which Lenin went more
deeply into the works of Karl Marx. The Leninist method (Marxist
through and through) of studying Marx was forged in the fire of the
revolution.</p>


<p>This method of studying Marx armed Lenin for struggle against
the distortions of Marxism with their emasculation of its revolutionary
essence. We know what an important part Lenin's book " State and
Revolution " has played in the organising of the October Revolution and
the Soviet Power. This book is entirely based on a deep study of Marx's
revolutionary teachings about the state. There Lenin writes :</p>


<p class="indentb">Marx's doctrines are now undergoing the
same fate which, more
than once in the course of history, has befallen the doctrines of other
revolutionary thinkers and leaders of oppressed classes struggling for
emancipation. During the lifetime of great revolutionaries, the
oppressing classes have invariably meted out to them relentless
persecution, and received their teaching with the most savage
hostility, most furious hatred, and a ruthless campaign of lies and
slanders. After their death, however, attempts are usually made to turn
them into harmless saints, canonising them, as it were, and investing
their name with a certain halo by way of "consolation" to the oppressed
classes, and with the object of duping them, while at the same time
emasculating and vulgarising the real essence of their revolutionary
theories and blunting their revolutionary edge. At the present time the
bourgeoisie and the opportunists within the labour movement are
co-operating in this work of adulterating Marxism. They omit,
obliterate, and distort the revolutionary side of its teaching, its
revolutionary soul, and push to the foreground and extol what is, or
seems, acceptable to the bourgeoisie. All the Socialist Chauvinists are
now " Marxists " - save the mark<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="" id="_ednref1">[1]</a>!
And more and more do German bourgeois professors, erstwhile specialists
in the demolition of Marx, now speak of the "National-German" Marx,
who, forsooth, has educated the splendidly organised working class for
the present predatory war. In these circumstances, when the distortion
of Marxism is so widespread, our first task is to resuscitate the real
nature of Marx's teachings on the subject of the State. (First page in
" The State and Revolution.")</p>


<p>In "The Foundations of Leninism " Comrade Stalin wrote :</p>


<p class="indentb">Not until the next phase, the phase of
direct action, of
proletarian revolution, when the overthrow of the bourgeoisie had
become a question of practical politics, did the problem of finding
reserves for the proletarian army (strategy) become actual, and the
problem of the organisation of that army whether on the parliamentary
or the extra-parliamentary field (tactics) clearly demand a solution.
Not until this phase had begun, could proletarian strategy be
systematised and proletarian tactics be elaborated. <em>It was
now that Lenin disinterred Marx's and Engels' masterly ideas on
strategy and tactics, ideas which the opportunists of the Second
International had buried out of sight</em>. (The italics are
mine. - N.K.)</p>


<p>But Lenin did not confine himself to re-establishing
individual tactical propositions of Marx and Engels. He developed them
further and supplemented them by new ideas and propositions, creating
out of all this a system of rules and leading principles for the
conduct of the class struggle of the proletariat. Such pamphlets of
Lenin as "What is to be Done," "Two Tactics," "Imperialism," "State and
Revolution," "Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky," and
"Left-Wing Communism," will no doubt be a most valuable contribution to
the common treasure-house of Marxism, to its revolutionary arsenal. The
strategy and tactic of Leninism is a science regarding the leadership
of the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat." (J. Stalin, "
Questions of Leninism.") Marx and Engels said that their teaching "is
not a dogma, but a guide to action." These words of theirs were
continually repeated by Lenin. The method by which he studied the works
of Marx and Engels, and revolutionary practice, all the circumstances
of the epoch of proletarian revolutions, helped Lenin to convert just
the revolutionary side of Marx into a real guide to action.</p>


<p>I shall dwell on a question which is of decisive significance.
Not so long ago we celebrated the fifteenth anniversary of the Soviet
Power. And in this connection we recalled how the seizure of power was
organised in October. it wasn't a spontaneous act, it was deeply
thought out by Lenin who was guided by Marx's direct instructions
regarding the organising of an uprising.</p>


<p>The October Revolution, by placing dictatorship into the hands
of the proletariat, radically changed all the conditions of struggle,
but only because Lenin was guided not by the letter of the teachings of
Marx and Engels, but by their revolutionary essence, because he knew
how to apply Marxism also to the building up of Socialism in the epoch
of proletarian dictatorship.</p>


<p>I shall only dwell on a few points. Thorough research work is
necessary here: select everything that was taken by Lenin from Marx and
Engels, indicating in what periods and in connection with what tasks of
the revolutionary movement. I have not even mentioned such important
questions as the national question, imperialism, &amp;c. The
publication of Lenin's complete collected works makes this work easier.
<em>Lenin's way of studying Marx in all the phases of
revolutionary struggle from beginning to end will help us to understand
better and go deeper not only into Marx, but into Lenin himself, into
his method of studying Marx and the method of converting Marx's
teachings into a guide to action.</em></p>


<p>There is one more side of Lenin's study of Marx which must be
mentioned owing to its great significance. Lenin did not only study
what Marx and Engels wrote as well as what Marx's " critics " wrote
about him, <em>he also studied the way which led Marx to his
various views, and the works and books which stimulated Marx's thoughts
and drove them in a definite direction</em>. He studied, so to
speak, the sources of Marxist philosophy, what and how precisely Marx
took from this or that writer. He was specially concerned in making a
deep study of the method of dialectical materialism. In 1922, in the
article "Meaning of Militant Materialism," Lenin said that it was up to
the contributors to the periodical "Under the Banner of Marxism " to
organise the work for a systematic study of Hegel's dialectics from the
materialist point of view. He believed that without a serious
philosophical basis it is impossible to hold out in the struggle
against the pressure of bourgeois ideas and the restoration of
bourgeois philosophy. It was on the basis of his own experience that
Lenin wrote about the manner of studying Hegel's dialectics from the
materialist point of view. We give here the corresponding paragraph
from Lenin's article "On the Meaning of Militant Materialism."</p>


<p class="indentb">But in order to avoid reacting to such
a phenomenon
unintelligently, we must understand that no natural science, no
materialism whatever, can hold out in the struggle against the
onslaught of bourgeois ideas and the restoration of bourgeois
philosophy without a solid philosophical basis. In order, to give aid
to this struggle and help to carry it out to its successful conclusion,
the natural scientist must be a modern Materialist--a conscious
adherent of that Materialism which Marx-represents that is, he must be
a <em>dialectical</em> Materialist. To achieve this the
staff of <em>Under the Banner of Marxism</em> must
organise a systematic study of Hegelian dialectics from the Materialist
point of view, i.e., the dialectics which Marx applied concretely in
his <em>Capital</em> and used in his historical and
political works. . . .</p>


<p class="indentb">. . . Basing ourselves on the manner in
which Marx applied the
materialist conception of Hegelian dialectics we can, and must, work
out these dialectics from all sides. The magazine must publish excerpts
from the principal works of Hegel; must interpret them
materialistically, and give examples of how Marx applied dialectics, as
well as examples of dialectics from the field of economic and political
relations. Modern history, particularly modern imperialist war and
revolution, provide innumerable examples of this kind. The editors and
staff of <em>Under the Banner of Marxism</em> should, I
think, represent a sort of "Association of Materialist Friends of
Hegelian Philosophy." Modern natural scientists will find (if they will
seek and if we can learn to help them) in the materialist
interpretation of Hegelian dialectics a number of answers to those
brought forward to the front and which cause the intellectual admirers
of bourgeois fashions to "slip" into the reactionary camp. (P. 41, <em>Lenin
on Religion</em>, Little Lenin Library, Volume VII.)</p>


<p>The IX. and XII. volumes of Lenin's collected works have
already been published in the Soviet Union. They divulge the whole
process of Lenin's thought when he was working through Hegel's chief
works, they show how he applied the method of dialectical materialism
to the study of Hegel, how closely he connected this study with a deep
study of Marx's sayings, with the ability of converting Marxism into a
guide to action in the most varied circumstances.</p>


<p>But Hegel was not the only object of Lenin's study. He read
Marx's letter to Engels of November 1859, in which he criticises
severely Lassalle's book, " The Philosophy of Heraclitus, the Dark, of
Ephesus " (two volumes), and calls this work "amateurish." Lenin gives,
to begin with, a brief formulation of Marx's criticism: "Lassalle
simply <em>repeats</em> Hegel, he <em>describes</em>
him, <em>ruminates</em> millions of times on certain
sayings of Heraclitus, embellishing his work with a surfeit of Most
learned Gellertian ballast." But, nevertheless, Lenin plunges into the
study of this work of Lassalle, makes conspects and extracts of it,
writes notes to it, and sums it up thus: "Marx's criticism is on the
whole correct. It isn't worth while to read Lassalle's book." But the
work over this book gave Lenin himself a deeper understanding of Marx :
he understood why this book of Lassalle displeased Marx to such an
extent.</p>


<p>In conclusion, I will mention one more form of Lenin's work
over Marx - the popularisation of Marx's teachings. If the populariser
takes his work "seriously," if his aim is to give in a very simple and
intelligible form an explanation of the very essence of this or that
theory, this work will help him very much.</p>


<p>Lenin treated this work very seriously indeed. "There is
nothing I would like so much as being able to write for the workers,"
he wrote from exile to Plekhanov and Axelrod.</p>


<p>He wanted to explain and bring near to the masses the
teachings of Marx. In the nineties, when he worked in workers' circles,
he endeavoured to explain to them first of all the first volume of
"Capital," and illustrated the propositions brought forward there by
examples from the life of his hearers. In 1911, in the Party school in
Lonjumeau (near Paris), where Lenin was working hard for the
preparation of cadres of leaders for the budding revolutionary
movement, he lectured to the workers on political economy, and tried to
bring home to them as simply as possible the foundations of Marx's
teachings. In his articles to <em>Pravda</em>, Ilyitch
-tried to popularise various points from Marx's teachings. A sample of
Leninist popularisation is his characterisation during the 1921
disputes on trade unions of the manner of studying the subject with the
application of the dialectical method. Lenin said :</p>


<p>To know the subject thoroughly, one must take hold of and
study all its sides, all the connections and its proper place in the
given situation. We shall never fully attain this, but the demand of
many-sidedness will make us steer clear of errors and inertia. This
comes first. Secondly, dialectical logic demands that the subject be
taken in its development, in its "self-motion" (as Hegel says) and its
changes. Thirdly, human practice must concentrate on full "definition"
of the subject, as a criterion of truth, as well as a practical
indicator of the connection of the subject with what man needs.
Fourthly, dialectical logic teaches us that "There is no abstract
truth, that truth is always concrete," as the late Plekhanov, who was a
follower of Hegel, liked to say.</p>


<p>These few lines are the quintessence of what Lenin came to as
a result of long years of work over philosophical questions, in which
he always made use of the method of dialectical materialism, "
consulting " all the time, Marx. In a compressed form, these lines
indicate all that is essential, that must be a guide to action, while
studying phenomena.</p>


<p>The way in which Lenin worked over Marx is a lesson in how to
study Lenin himself. His teaching is inseparably connected with the
teaching of Marx, it is Marxism in action, it is the Marxism of the
epoch of imperialism and proletarian revolutions.</p>
