<h1>The Marx-Engels Institute</h1>
<h2>by "L.B."</h2>
<h3>(Translated from <em>La Critique sociale</em>, no.2, July 1931,
pp.51-2.)</h3>
<p class="fst">The Marx-Engels Institute was founded towards the end of
the year 1920, but was only able to install itself in the building it
has since occupied a year later (previously the town residence of the
Dolgorukov princes <sup class="note"><a id="1b" href="#1" name="1b" target="_blank" >[1]</a></sup>),
situated in Moscow's Znamenka quarter, formerly the Malo-Znamenky
sector, now Marx-Engels Street.</p>

<p>In a pamphlet published in 1929 the Institute's founder, D.
Riazonov, informed us that the Central Committee of the Communist Party
- following the entire preparatory work of Riazonov, about which the
pamphlet was silent - had originally proposed that he organise a
"Museum of Marxism". But Riazonov envisaged something greater, more
important, and also more useful. He obtained its permission to create a
scientific institute, a sort of "laboratory" where historian and
activist alike could study "in the most favourable conditions the
birth, development and spread of the theory and practice of scientific
socialism", whose aim was to contribute the utmost "to the scientific
propaganda of marxism".</p>
<p>It should be said straightaway that the Institute, while remaining
strictly faithful to its aim, and without ever departing from the ideas
that had caused it to be set up, soon extended the field of its
researches and even, may it be said, its ambitions. Nothing, whether
close or distant, that touches upon the project of liberating the
people and the working class movement throughout the world and
socialist thought, is alien to it.</p>
<p>In 1924 the Institute was included among the cultural establishments
of the Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R., in other words
recognised as a state institution, and functioning -in view of its
exceptional importance - under the immediate control of the Central
Executive Committee.</p>
<p>From 1924 onwards,
after four years of existence - including years of famine and
civil war - Riazonov was able to say, and not without pride, that the
Marx-Engels Institute was among the foremost in the world. In fact, on
the 1st January 1925 the Institute's library already possessed 15,628
selected volumes. Moreover, its archives contained numerous manuscripts
of Marx and Engels, and myriads of others of the highest interest on
the history and men of the First International, Saint-Simonism,
Fourrierism<sup class="note"><a id="2b" href="#2" name="2b" target="_blank" >[2]</a></sup>,
and the revolutionary and working class movement - among them the
journal maintained by Lassalle in his youth<sup class="note"><a id="3b"
href="#3" name="3b" target="_blank" >[3]</a></sup>, and some two hundred letters of the
same sort to his acquaintances. Finally, it had acquired the rarest
publications with which Marx and Engels had collaborated - including
the <em>Vorw&auml;rts</em>
published by Marx in Paris in 1844, and the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>

of 1842-43.</p>
<p>To begin with the Institute drew its books from the nationalised
libraries, among them that of Tani&eacute;ev, containing an excellent
collection of socialist authors, and a rare collection of prints from
the time of the French revolution. However, this source was quickly
exhausted, for even in the richest libraries of the dignitaries of the
old regime and other aristocrats he was only able to find a few books
that were of interest to the Institute: the previous
political conditions would in no way allow those who were interested to
procure foreign publications that dealt with the social questions and
revolutionary movements of Europe; even some books by Renan and Michelet<sup
class="note"><a id="4b" href="#4" name="4b" target="_blank" >[4]</a></sup>were
forbidden; socialist publications were never freely admitted into
Russia.</p>
<p>Riazonov bought the library of Theodore Mautner (a socialist
book-lover), that of Karl Gr&uuml;nberg (a historian of socialism), and
that of M. Windelband, consisting of philosophical works. He obtained
all that was necessary to complete the collections from abroad and
undertook research in the archives and the great European libraries,
having manuscripts and documents photographed, and even some printed
matter that could not be found in libraries.</p>
<p>This is how the materials were photocopied relating to the work of
Marx and Engels conserved in the archives of the German Social
Democratic Party, the essential documents on the life and trial of
Babeuf<sup class="note"><a id="5b" href="#5" name="5b" target="_blank" >[5]</a></sup> in
the national archives in Paris, on the revolution of 1848, the trial of
Auguste Blanqui<sup class="note"><a id="6b" href="#6" name="6b" target="_blank" >[6]</a></sup>,
the Paris Commune of 1793<sup class="note"><a id="7b" href="#7"
name="7b" target="_blank" >[7]</a></sup>, the Commune of 1871<sup class="note"><a
id="8b" href="#8" name="8b" target="_blank" >[8]</a></sup>, etc...</p>

<p>At present the Institute has collected thousands of photographs to
make up the necessary documentation, as much for general resarch as for
publishing. Among the publications of the Institute we should note the
monumental edition of the works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in
twenty-seven volumes (of which seven have appeared), the <em>Marx-Engels
Archives</em> and the <em>Annals of Marxism</em>, rich in studies and
documents, the <em>Materialist Library</em> (including the works of
Holbach, Hobbes, Diderot, Feuerbach, La Mettrie, etc.), the <em>Complete
Works</em> of G. V. Plekhanov, Russia's foremost theoretician of
marxism, those of K. Kautsky, of P. Lafargue, the <em>Marxist Library</em>,
including the best edition of <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>,
annotated by Riazonov, the Library of the <em>Classics of Political
Economy</em>, etc.</p>

<p>The Institute now has more than 400,000 volumes, including a very
fine collection on the French revolution, with the works and
publications of Marat, Robespierre, Anacharsis Clootz<sup class="note"><a
id="9b" href="#9" name="9b" target="_blank" >[9]</a></sup>, and Babeuf in first
editions, the very rare brochures and pamphlets of the Enrag&eacute;s<sup
class="note"><a id="10b" href="#10" name="10b" target="_blank" >[10]</a></sup>, the
most precious periodicals, such as the <em>Ami du Peuple</em>, the <em>P&egrave;re
Duchesne</em>, the <em>Tribun du Peuple</em>, etc.; a complete
collection, also in the original editions, of the works of Robert Owen<sup
class="note"><a id="11b" href="#11" name="11b" target="_blank" >[11]</a></sup>,
including many brochures, manifestos, etc., not mentioned in the
remarkable <em>Bibliography of Robert Owen</em> (2nd enlarged edition,
1925); a remarkable collection of the British economists; an almost
complete collection of the periodicals of 1848 (over 400 titles), and
most of the publications relating to the events of 1848 in the various
countries; and the main publications of the working class and on the
working class movement, etc.</p>

<p>Among recent acquisitions we might mention a file of <em>The Times</em>
from its foundation to the war; a very rare file of the <em>New York
Tribune</em>, including the years when Marx and Engels collaborated
with it; the unique collection of M. Helfert, wholly devoted to the
revolutionary movement of 1848-49 in Austria, Hungary, Italy and the
slav countries, amounting to 5,000 volumes, 10,000 posters, placards,
proclamations, etc., 4,500 prints and portraits, and 1,000 autograph
letters; a collection of manuscripts, most of them unpublished, of
Gracchus Babeuf, including his letters to his son Emil, his wife, and
his writings during his trial; and a remarkable collection of posters,
placards, cartoons and other documents from the time of the Commune.</p>
<p>Whereas a partial documentation is generally to be found in most of
the important European libraries, only relating to the social movement
of such and such a country (and even within these limits, often
incomplete), the various collections of the Institute make up a unique
centre of documentation on the working class movement in Europe.</p>
<p>The Institute is organised in such a way as to assist work and make
it productive; it is a centre of study and of publication at one and
the same time; it is divided into different sections or <em>cabinets</em>
forming two series; a historical series, and an ideological series.</p>
<p>The historical series includes these sections: German (the
richest), 50,000 volumes; French (almost 40,000 volumes); English; and
each has its own archives.</p>
<p>The ideological series includes these sections: Philosophy
(25,000 volumes); Socialism, where the Mautner, Gr&uuml;nberg and
Tani&eacute;ev collections are deposited; Political Economy (20,000
volumes); Sociology, Law and Politics; and archives are also attached
to each cabinet.</p>

<p>The Institute also has a museum, where prints, stamps, portraits,
and medals are exhibited - set up for instruction, not for marvelling,
with the sole aim of encouraging work. It organises exhibitions
methodically. An exhibition on the French revolution in 1928 aroused
the liveliest interest.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, it was the first undertaking of its kind to be
made abroad. It was an excellent illustration of the Institute's
methods, its educational outlook, its researches and its wealth. It
allowed schoolchildren and workers to study the forerunners of modern
ideas and the pioneers of socialism, to follow the events of the
revolution in the order in which they happened, to get to know a little
about the men and the atmosphere, and to form an opinion of the press
of the time, and how it represented the actions of the popular masses
and the struggle of the classes and parties.</p>
<p>In the same methodical manner, and with the same scientific
preoccupations, the Institute organised an important exhibition on the
Commune of 1871. Unique material was arranged in four spacious rooms
(including 375 authentic documents of the time, 223 periodical
publications, a quantity of prints and cartoons, and two flags) on the
Second Empire, the war and the siege of Paris, the origins of the
Commune, its 72 days of existence, and its bloody suppression.</p>
<p>We should also mention a remarkable Marx-Engels exhibition,
pictorially very rich in rare editions, providing authentic new
information on the life and work of the founders of scientific
socialism, on the origin and development of marxism, and on its
distribution throughout the world.</p>
<p>Such, in sum, is the unprecedented work of the Marx-Engels
Institute, corresponding to the new needs of our time.</p>
