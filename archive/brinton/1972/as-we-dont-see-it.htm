<hr>

<p class="fst">When, in 1967, we first published <i>As We See It</i> we felt it 
would be both accurate and a fairly concise summary of our views. Alternatives 
had been discussed and every possible effort had been made to avoid ambiguities. 
We thought we had produced a fairly explicit text, acceptance of which should be 
the basis of adherence to a <i>Solidarity</i> group.</p>

<p class="fst">Over the years we have come to realize that we were wrong. There 
was either something the matter with the document - or with some of those who 
read it. Or perhaps there was something the matter with us - for having thought 
the text was self-explanatory. Radicals repeatedly told us that they agreed with 
every word of the statement ... and in the next breath asked us why we were not 
doing faction work in the Labour Party, or living in communes, or campaigning 
for the trade union "lefts", or eulogizing the Black Panthers or Karume's 
anti-imperialist regime in Zanzibar, or participating in the anti-Common-Market 
agitation. Some even asked why we were not advocating the launching of a "real 
revolutionary, Leninist party".</p>

<p class="fst">We now feel it necessary to dot some i's and cross some t's. What 
follows is an attempt to state explicitly thoughts that were only hinted at, and 
to formulate in writing propositions that were only implied. <i>As We Don't See 
It</i> would convey the general tenor of what follows. In an attempt to avoid 
further ambiguity we will also discuss some matters that were not dealt with in 
the original text.</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<p class="fst">1. "Throughout the world" means exactly what it says. It does not 
mean everywhere except Social-Democratic Sweden, Castro's Cuba, Tito's 
Yugoslavia, Israel's kibbutzim or Sékou Touré's Guinea. "Throughout the world" 
includes pre-Stalinist, Stalinist and post-Stalinist Russia, Ben Bella's and 
Boumedienne's Algeria and the People's Republics of Uzbekistan and North 
Vietnam. Everywhere also includes Albania (and China).</p>

<p class="fst">Our comments about contemporary society apply to all these 
countries just as much as to the USA or to Britain (under either Labour or 
Conservative governments). When we talk of privileged minorities who "control 
the means of production" and who "use the whole machinery of the state" to 
maintain themselves in power we are making a universal critique to which, at the 
moment, we can see no exceptions.</p>

<p class="fst">It <i>follows</i> that we don't regard any of these countries as 
socialist and that we don't act as if we had lurking suspicions that they might 
be something other than what they are: hierarchically-structured class societies 
based on wage slavery and exploitation. Their identification with socialism - 
even as deformed variants - is a slander against the very concept of socialism 
(abortions, after all, share some of the attributes of their parents). It is 
moreover a source of endless mystification and confusion. It also follows from 
this basic assessment that we do not support China against Russia, or Russia 
against China (or alternatively the one and then other), that we do not carry 
NLF flags on demonstrations (the enemies of our enemies are not necessarily our 
friends), and that we refrain from joining sundry choruses demanding more 
East-West trade, more Summit Conferences or more ping-pong diplomacy.</p>

<p class="fst">In every country of the world the rulers oppress the ruled and 
persecute genuine revolutionaries. In every country the main enemy of the people 
is their own ruling class. This alone can provide the basis of genuine 
internationalism of the oppressed.</p>

<p class="fst">2. Socialism cannot be equated with the "coming of power of 
parties claiming to represent the working class". Political power is a fraud if 
working people do not take over and retain power <i>in production</i>. If they 
achieve such power, the organs exerting it (Workers' Councils) will take and 
implement all the necessary political decisions. <i>It follows</i> that we don't 
advocate the formation of "better" or "more revolutionary political parties 
whose objective would remain the "capture of state power". The <i>Party's</i> 
power may grow out of the barrel of a gun. The power of the <i>working class</i> 
grows out of its management of the economy and of society as a whole.</p>

<p class="fst">Socialism cannot be equated with such measures as the 
"nationalization of the means of production". These may help the rulers of 
various class societies to rationalize <i>their</i> system of exploitation and 
solve <i>their own</i> problems. We refuse to choose between options defined by 
our class enemies. <i>It follows</i> that we don't urge nationalization (or 
anything else for that matter) on governments of either "right" or "left".</p>

<p class="fst">Section 2 implies that modern capitalism <i>can</i> further 
develop the means of production. At a cost, it can improve living standards. But 
neither of these has any socialist content. Anyone who wants three square meals 
a day and the prospect of endless employment can find them in any well-run gaol. <i>
It follows</i> that we don't denounce capitalism primarily on the basis of its 
inadequacies in these fields. Socialism, for us, is not about transistors for 
the prisoners. It is about the destruction of the industrial prison itself. It 
is not only about more bread, but about who runs the bakery.</p>

<p class="fst">The section finally emphasizes the multiple methods whereby the 
system perpetuates itself. By mentioning <i>propaganda</i> as well as policemen, <i>
schools</i> as well as prisons, <i>traditional values</i> and <i>traditional 
morality</i> as well as traditional methods of physical coercion, the section 
stresses an important obstacle to the achievement of a free society, namely the 
fact that the vast majority of the exploited and the manipulated have 
internalized and largely accepted the system's norms and values (for example 
such concepts as hierarchy, the division of society into order-givers and 
order-takers, wage labour, and the polarity of sexual roles) and consider them 
intrinsically rational. Because of all this <i>it follows</i> that we reject as 
incomplete (and hence inadequate) notions which attribute the perpetuation of 
the system solely to police repression or to the "betrayals" of various 
political or trade union leaders.</p>

<p class="fst">A crisis of values and an increased questioning of authority 
relations are, however, developing features of contemporary society. The growth 
of these crises is one of the preconditions for socialist revolution. Socialism 
will only be possible when the majority of people understand the need for social 
change, become aware of their ability to transform society, decide to exert 
their collective power to this end, and know with what they want to replace the 
present system. <i>It follows</i> that we reject analyses (such as those of 
every variety of Leninist or Trotskyist) who define the main crisis of modern 
society as "a crisis of leadership". They are all generals in search of an army, 
for whom recruitment figures are the main yardstick of success. For us 
revolutionary change is a question of consciousness: the consciousness that 
would make generals redundant.</p>

<p class="fst">3. When we refer to the "traditional parties of the left" we 
don't only have in mind the social-democratic and "communist" parties. Parties 
of this type have administered, administer and will continue to administer 
exploitative class societies. Under the title of "traditional parties of the 
left" we also include the trad revs [traditional revolutionaries], i.e. the 
various Leninist, Trotskyist and Maoid sects who are the carriers of state 
capitalist ideology and the embryonic nuclei of repressive, state-capitalist 
power.</p>

<p class="fst">These groups are prefigurations of alternative types of 
exploitation. Their critiques of the social-democratic and "Stalinist" or 
"revisionist" left appear virulent enough, but they never deal with fundamentals 
(such as the structure of decision-making, the locus of power, the primacy of the 
Party, the existence of hierarchy, the maximization of surplus value, the 
perpetuation of wage labour, and inequality). This is no accident and flows from 
the fact that they themselves accept these fundamentals. Bourgeois ideology is 
far more widespread than many revolutionaries believe and has in fact deeply 
permeated their thinking. In this sense Marx's statement about "the dominant 
ideas of each epoch being the ideas of its ruling class" is far more true than 
Marx could ever have anticipated.</p>

<p class="fst">As far as authoritarian class society (and the 
libertarian-socialist alternative) is concerned <i>the trad revs are part of the 
problem</i>, <i>not part of the solution</i>. Those who subscribe to 
social-democratic or Bolshevik ideology are themselves either victims of the 
prevailing mystification (and attempts should be made to demystify them), or 
they are the conscious exponents and future beneficiaries of a new form of class 
rule (and should be ruthlessly exposed). In either case <i>it follows</i> that 
there is nothing "sectarian" in systematically proclaiming opposition to what 
they stand for. Not to do so would be tantamount to suppressing our critique of 
half of the prevailing social order. It would mean to participate in the general 
mystification of traditional politics (where one thinks one thing and says 
another) and to deny the very basis of our <i>independent</i> political 
existence.</p>

<p class="fst">4. Because the traditional parties cannot be "reformed", 
"captured", or converted into instruments of working class emancipation - and 
because we are reluctant to indulge in double-talk and double-think - <i>it 
follows</i> that we do not indulge in such activities as "critically supporting" 
the Labour Party at election time, calling for "Labour to Power" between 
elections, and generally participating in sowing illusions, the better at a 
later date to "take people through the experience" of seeing through them. The 
Labour and Communist Parties may be marginally superior to the Conservative 
Party in driving private capitalism along the road to state capitalism. The trad 
revs would certainly prove superior to them both. But we are not called upon to 
make any choice of the kind: it is not the role of revolutionaries to be the 
midwives of new forms of exploitation. <i>It follows</i> that we would rather 
fight for what we want (even if we don't immediately get it) than fight for what 
we don't want ... and get it.</p>

<p class="fst">The trade union bureaucracy is an essential component of 
developing state capitalist societies. The trade union leaders neither "betray" 
nor "sell out" when they manipulate working class struggles and seek to use them 
for their own ends. They are not "traitors" when they seek to increase their 
material rewards or to lessen the frequency with which they have to submit to 
election - they are acting logically and according to their own interests, which 
just happen to be different from those of working people. <i>It follows</i> that 
we do not urge people to elect "better" leaders, to "democratize" the unions or 
to create new ones, which under the circumstances of today would suffer exactly 
the same fate as the old ones. All these are "non-issues" about which only those 
who have failed to grasp the real root of the problem can get worked up.</p>

<p class="fst">The real need is to concentrate on the <i>positive</i> task of 
building the alternative (both in people's minds and in reality), namely <i>
autonomous job organizations</i>, linked to others in the same industry and 
elsewhere, and controlled from below. Sooner or later such organizations will 
either enter into conflict with the existing outfits claiming to "represent" the 
working class (and it would be premature at this stage to define the possible 
forms of this conflict), or they will bypass the old organizations altogether.</p>

<p class="fst">5. This section differentiates our concept of socialism from most 
of those prevailing today. Socialism, for us, is not just a question of economic 
reorganization from which other benefits will "inevitably" follow, without <i>
consciously</i> being fought for. It is a <i>total</i> vision of a <i>completely</i> 
different society. Such a vision is linked to the <i>total critique</i> of 
capitalism we have previously referred to.</p>

<p class="fst">Social-democrats and Bolsheviks denounce equality as "utopian", 
"petty-bourgeois", or "anarchist". They dismiss the advocacy of freedom as 
"abstract", and reciprocal recognition as "liberal humanism". They will concede 
that the radical transformation of all social relations is a valid ultimate 
objective, but cannot see it as an essential, immediate ingredient of the very 
process of meaningful change.</p>

<p class="fst">When we talk of "man's positive self-consciousness" and of "his 
understanding of his environment and of himself we mean the gradual discarding 
of myths and of all types of false consciousness (religion, nationalism, 
patriarchal attitudes, the belief in the rationality of hierarchy, etc.). The 
precondition of human freedom is the understanding of all that limits it. 
Positive self-consciousness implies the gradual breakdown of that state of 
chronic schizophrenia in which - through conditioning and other mechanisms - 
most people succeed in carrying mutually incompatible ideas in their heads. It 
means accepting coherence, and perceiving the relation of means and ends. It 
means exposing those who organize conferences about "workers' control" ... 
addressed by union officials elected for life. It means patiently explaining the 
incompatibilities of "people's capitalism", "parliamentary socialism", 
"Christian communism", "anarcho-Zionism", "Party-led 'workers' councils' ", and 
other such rubbish. It means understanding that a non-manipulative society 
cannot be achieved by manipulative means or a classless society through 
hierarchical structures. This attempt at both gaining insight and at imparting 
it will be difficult and prolonged. It will doubtless be dismissed as 
"intellectual theorizing" by every "voluntarist" or "activist" tendency, eager 
for short cuts to the promised land and more concern with movement than with 
direction.</p>

<p class="fst">Because we think people can and should understand what they are 
doing, <i>it follows</i> that we reject many of the approaches so common in the 
movement today. In practice this means avoiding the use of revolutionary myths 
and the resort to manipulated confrontations, intended to raise consciousness. 
Underlying both of these is the usually unformulated assumption that people 
cannot understand social reality and act rationally on their own.</p>

<p class="fst">Linked to our rejection of revolutionary myths is our rejection 
of ready-made political labels. We want no gods, not even those of the Marxist 
or anarchist pantheons. We live in neither the Petrograd of 1917 nor the 
Barcelona of 1936. We are <i>ourselves</i>: the product of the disintegration of 
traditional politics, in an advanced industrial country, in the second half of 
the twentieth century. It is to the problems and conflicts of <i>that</i> 
society that we must apply ourselves.</p>

<p class="fst">Although we consider ourselves part of the "libertarian left" we 
differ from most strands of the "cultural" or "political" underground. We have 
nothing in common, for instance, with those petty entrepreneurs, now thriving on 
the general confusion, who simultaneously promote such commodities as oriental 
mysticism, black magic, the drug cult, sexual exploitation (masquerading as 
sexual liberation) - seasoning it all with big chunks of populist mythology. 
Their dissemination of myths and their advocacy of "non-sectarian politics" do 
not prevent them from taking up, in practice, many reactionary stances. In fact, 
they ensure it. Under the mindless slogan of "Support for people in struggle", 
these tendencies advocate support for various nationalisms (today always 
reactionary) such as those of both IRAs and of all the NLFs.</p>

<p class="fst">Other strands, calling themselves "libertarian Marxist", suffer 
from middle class feelings of guilt which make them prone to workeritis. Despite 
this, their practice is both reformist and substitutionalist. For instance, when 
they (correctly) support struggles for limited objectives, such as those of 
squatters or Claimants' Unions, they often fail to stress the revolutionary 
implications of such collective direct action. Historically, direct action has 
often clashed with the reformist nature of the objectives pursued. Again, such 
tendencies support the IRAs and NLFs and refrain from criticizing the Cuban, 
North Vietnamese or Chinese regimes. Having rejected the Party, they 
nevertheless share with Leninism a bourgeois concept of consciousness.</p>

<p class="fst">Because we think our politics should be coherent we also reject 
the approach of others in the libertarian movement who place their whole 
emphasis on personal liberation or who seek individual solutions to what are 
social problems. We dissociate ourselves from those who equate the violence of 
the oppressor with the violence of the oppressed (in condemnation of "all 
violence"), and from those who place the rights of strikers on the picket line 
on the same footing as the right of scabs to blackleg (in an abstract defence of 
"freedom as such"). Similarly, anarcho-Catholicism and anarcho-Maoism are 
internally incoherent outlooks, incompatible with revolutionary self-activity.</p>

<p class="fst">We feel that there should be some relation between our vision of 
socialism and what we do here and now. <i>It follows</i> that we seek as from 
now, and starting with those closest to us, to puncture some of the more widely 
held political myths. These are not confined to the "right" - with its belief 
that hierarchy and inequality are of the essence of the human condition. We 
consider irrational (and/or dishonest) that those who talk most of the masses 
(and of the capacity of the working class to create a new society) should have 
the least confidence in people's ability to dispense with leaders. We also 
consider it irrational that most radical advocates of "genuine social change" 
should incorporate in their own ideas, programmes and organizational 
prescriptions so many of the values, priorities and models they claim to oppose.</p>

<p class="fst">6. When we say that socialist society will be "built from below", 
we mean just that. We do <i>not</i> mean "initiated from above and then endorsed 
from below". Nor do we mean "planned from above and later checked from below". 
We mean there should be no separation between organs of decision and organs of 
execution. This is why we advocate workers' "management" of production, and 
avoid the ambiguous demand for workers' "control". (The differences - both 
theoretical and historical - between the two are outlined in the introduction to 
our book on <i><a href="../1970/workers-control/index.htm" target="_self">The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control, 1917-1921</a></i>.)</p>

<p class="fst">We deny the revolutionary organization any specific prerogative 
in the post-revolutionary period, or in the building of the new society. Its 
main function in this period will be to stress the primacy of the Workers' 
Councils (and of bodies based on them) as instruments of decisional authority, 
and to struggle against all those who would seek to lessen or to bypass this 
authority - or to vest power elsewhere. Unlike others on the left who dismiss 
thinking about the new society as "preoccupation with the cookshops of the 
future" we have outlined our ideas about a possible structure of such a society 
in some detail in our pamphlet on <i>Workers' Councils and the Economics of a 
Self-Managed Society</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">7. This section is perhaps the most important and least 
understood of the whole statement. It is the key to how we view our <i>practical 
work</i>. It defines yardsticks with which we can approach everyday political 
life and rationally use our mental and physical resources. It explains why we 
consider certain questions significant while others are dismissed as non-issues. 
Within the limits of our own coherence, it explains the content of our paper.</p>

<p class="fst">Because we do not consider them of particular relevance to the 
attitudes and aptitudes we seek to develop, we do not get worked up about such 
matters as parliamentary or trade union elections (getting others to do things 
for one), the Common Market or the convertibility crisis (partisan involvement 
in the problems of the rulers is of no help to the ruled), or about the struggle 
in Ireland or various putsches in Africa ("taking sides" in struggles waged 
under the domination of a totally reactionary false consciousness). We cannot 
ignore these events without ignoring a portion of reality but we can at least 
avoid endowing them with a relevance to socialism they do not possess. 
Conversely we think the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the French events of 
May 1968 <i>were</i> deeply significant (for they were struggles against 
bureaucracy, and attempts at self-management in both Eastern and Western 
contexts).</p>

<p class="fst">These yardsticks also help clarify our attitude to various 
industrial disputes. While most are a challenge to the employer, some have a 
deeper socialist content than others. Why for instance are "unofficial" actions 
on conditions of work, waged under the close control of the rank and file, 
usually of deeper significance than "official" actions on questions of wages, 
run from afar by the union bureaucrats? In terms of the development of socialist 
consciousness <i>how</i> a struggle is waged and what it is <i>about</i> are of 
fundamental importance. <i>Socialism</i>, after all, <i>is about who takes the 
decisions</i>. We believe this needs stressing, <i>in practice</i>, <i>from now</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">In our accounts of disputes our guide line is that one cannot 
tidy up reality, and that more is gained by honestly analyzing real difficulties 
than by living in a mythical world, where one takes one's wishes for reality. <i>
It follows</i> that we seek to avoid the "triumphalist" (in reality 
manipulatory) tone that mars so much of the "interventions" of the trad revs.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally the emphasis on self-activity, and its warning about the 
harmful effects of manipulation, substitutionism or reliance on others to do 
things for one have deeper implications, or relevance to our own organization.</p>

<p class="fst">8. We are not pacifists. We have no illusions about what we are 
up against. In all class societies, institutional violence weighs heavily and 
constantly on the oppressed. Moreover the rulers of such societies have always 
resorted to more explicit physical repression when their power and privileges 
were really threatened. Against repression by the ruling class we endorse the 
people's right to self-defence, by whatever means be appropriate.</p>

<p class="fst">The power of the rulers feeds on the indecision and confusion of 
the ruled. Their power will only be overcome if confronted with ours: the power 
of a conscious and self-reliant majority, knowing what it wants and determined 
to get it. In modern industrial societies the power of such a majority will lie 
where thousands congregate daily, to sell their labour power in the production 
of goods and services.</p>

<p class="fst">Socialism cannot be the result of a putsch, of the capture of 
some Palace, or of the blowing up of some Party or Police Headquarters, carried 
out "on behalf of the people" or "to galvanize the masses". If unsuccessful, all 
that such actions do is to create martyrs and myths - and to provoke intensified 
repression. If "successful", they would only substitute one ruling minority for 
another, i.e. bring about a new form of exploitative society. Nor can socialism 
be introduced by organizations themselves structured according to authoritarian, 
hierarchical, bureaucratic or semi-military patterns. All that such 
organizations have instituted (and, if "successful", are likely to continue 
instituting) are societies in their own image.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>The social revolution is no Party matter</i>. It will be the 
action of the immense majority, acting in the interests of the immense majority. 
The failures of social-democracy and of Bolshevism are the failure of a whole 
concept of politics, a concept according to which the oppressed could entrust 
their liberation to others than themselves. This lesson is gradually entering 
mass consciousness and preparing the ground for a genuinely libertarian 
revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">9. Because we reject Lenin's concept that the working class can 
only develop a trade union (or reformist) consciousness <i>it follows</i> that 
we reject the Leninist prescription that socialist consciousness has to be 
brought to the people from outside, or injected into the movement by political 
specialists: the professional revolutionaries. It further follows that we cannot 
behave as if we held such beliefs.</p>

<p class="fst">Mass consciousness, however, is never a theoretical 
consciousness, derived individually through the study of books. In modern 
industrial societies socialist consciousness springs from the real conditions of 
social life. These societies generate the conditions for an adequate 
consciousness. On the other hand, because they are class societies, they usually 
inhibit accession to that consciousness. Here lies both the dilemma and the 
challenge confronting modern revolutionaries.</p>

<p class="fst">There <i>is</i> a role for conscious revolutionaries. <i>Firstly</i>, 
through personal involvement, in one's own life and where possible at one's own 
place of work. (Here the main danger lies in "prolier than thou" attitudes, 
which lead people either to believe that there is little they can do if they are 
not industrial workers, or to pretend to be what they are not, in the false 
belief that the only relevant areas of struggle are in relation to industry.) <i>
Secondly</i>, by assisting others in struggle, by providing them with help or 
information they are denied. (Here the main danger lies in the offering of 
"interested help", where recruitment of the militant to the "revolutionary" 
organization is as much an objective of the "help" as is his victory in the 
struggle in which he is involved.) <i>Finally</i>, by pointing out and 
explaining the deep (but often hidden) relations between the socialist 
objective and what people are driven to do, through their own experiences and 
needs. (This is what we mean when we say revolutionaries should help make 
"explicit" the "implicitly" socialist content of many modern struggles.)</p>

<p class="fst">10. This section should differentiate <i>Solidarity</i> from the 
traditional type of political organization. We are not a leadership and do not 
aspire to be one. Because we do not want to lead or manipulate others, we have 
no use for hierarchy or for manipulatory mechanisms within our own ranks. 
Because we believe in the autonomy - ideological and organizational - of the 
working class, we cannot deny groups such autonomy within the Solidarity 
movement itself. On the contrary, we should seek to encourage it.</p>

<p class="fst">On the other hand we certainly wish to influence others and to 
disseminate Solidarity ideas (not just any ideas) as widely as possible. This 
requires the co-ordinated activity of people or groups, individually capable of 
self-activity and of finding their own level of involvement and their own areas 
of work. The instruments of such co-ordination should be flexible and vary 
according to the purpose for which co-ordination is required.</p>

<p class="fst">We do not reject organizations as necessarily implying 
bureaucracy. If we held such views there would be no socialist perspective 
whatsoever. On the contrary, we hold that organizations whose mechanisms (and 
their implications) are understood by all can alone provide the framework for 
democratic decision-making. There are no institutional guarantees against the 
bureaucratization of revolutionary groups. The only guarantee is the perpetual 
awareness and self-mobilization of their members. We are aware, however, of the 
danger of revolutionary groups becoming "ends in themselves". In the past, 
loyalties to groups have often superseded loyalties to ideas. Our prime 
commitment is to the social revolution - not to any particular political group, 
not even to Solidarity. Our organizational structure should certainly reflect 
the need for mutual assistance and support. But we have <i>no</i> other ulterior 
objectives, aspirations or ambitions. We therefore do not structure ourselves as 
if we had.</p>
