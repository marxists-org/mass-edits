<p class="fst">This pamphlet<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
consists of a translation of Reich's famous essay, "What is Class 
Consciousness?", first published in 1934 (under the pseudonym of Ernst Parell). 
It includes an introduction, some well-chosen illustrations, an excerpt from the 
preface to the third (1945) edition of Reich's <i>Mass Psychology of Fascism</i> 
and the full text of the <i>Sexpol Manifesto</i> of 1936.</p>

<p class="fst">The subject is topical in view of the resurgence of interest in 
Reich's writings and of the new awareness, at least among some revolutionaries, 
of the many factors influencing class consciousness, delaying its appearance or 
distorting its features. The essay is essential reading for anyone interested in 
looking a little deeper than the surface of things, or dissatisfied with the 
facile political "explanations" which are the stock-in-trade of so many on the 
Left.</p>

<p class="fst">Unfortunately Reich's text, while containing many insights of 
deep significance, is vitiated by a number of Leninist residues. Throughout 
Reich endorses the belief that "the leadership must bring revolutionary 
consciousness to the masses". He claims that "awareness of the social situation, 
of the means of its mastery and of the correct path to socialism must be 
concentrated in the revolutionary vanguard". Party members are described as the 
"engineers ... bricklayers and carpenters" of the building of socialism. Lenin 
is described as "the greatest mass psychologist of all time". All this moreover 
is not merely a verbal tribute: it permeates much of the practical approach. It 
is always the Party which is failing to understand the real nature of class 
consciousness, failing to stress this or that in its propaganda, and thereby 
failing to evoke the appropriate echoes.</p>

<p class="fst">It would be a tragedy, however, if modern revolutionaries saw no 
further than these hang-ups and, in their revulsion, failed to get to grips with 
Reich's main message, namely that "one of the reasons for the failure of the 
revolutionary movement is that the real life of individuals is played out on a 
different level than the instigators of social revolution believe". "While we 
were presenting the masses with grandiose historical analyses and economic 
arguments about the contradictions of imperialism, their innermost feelings were 
being kindled for Hitler". Still shocked at the "total failure" of the German 
Left, in the early 1930s "to seize the imagination and enthusiasm of the 
masses", Reich is making a plea for a revolutionary political psychology. This 
is a useful approach, provided it is seen as a means of gaining a new awareness 
into the springs of human behaviour, rather than as a means of developing a new 
manipulative technique.</p>

<p class="fst">Despite its title, Reich's essay is not really about the nature 
of class consciousness. It is about all that prevents the growth of such 
consciousness. Although constantly stressing the need for revolutionary 
leadership, Reich is realist enough to perceive that even the best of leadership 
cannot <i>create</i> class consciousness. It could not even contribute to the 
growth of such consciousness if it were not "inherent in the daily experience of 
the working class". The main problem for Reich is to seek what it is, in society 
at large (and in the practice of revolutionaries, in particular), which inhibits 
the growth of that consciousness.</p>

<p class="fst">"If you want to develop class consciousness", Reich writes, "you 
must at least know what you want to develop, why it does not spontaneously 
develop under the pressure of deprivations of every sort and hence what stops it 
doing so". Queries of this type, Reich reminds us, would always cause intense 
annoyance among party functionaries or activists of all kinds, a clear 
indication that the Left were not even aware of the importance of these 
questions, let alone capable of providing an answer. In this respect the "scene" 
doesn't seem to have changed much.</p>

<p class="fst">Reich starts by contrasting the "consciousness" of the leaders 
and the consciousness of the masses. The leaders know "about the contradictions 
of the capitalist economic system, the terrific possibilities of socialist 
planning the necessity of social revolution in order to accommodate the form of 
appropriation to the form of production". They know all about the "progressive 
and reactionary forces in history". The consciousness of the masses "is remote 
from such knowledge and from wide perspective. It is concerned with petty, 
banal, everyday questions". The leaders "grasp the objective socio-economic 
process, those external conditions of an economic and social nature to which the 
individuals constituting society are subjected". The masses, on the other hand, 
are "completely unconcerned by the quarrels of Russia and Japan, or England and 
America - or in the development of the productive forces". Mass consciousness is 
"made up of concern about food, clothing family relationships, the possibilities 
of sexual satisfaction in the narrowest sense, sexual pleasure and amusements in 
a broader sense, such as the cinema, theatre, fairground entertainments and 
dancing". It is concerned "with the difficulties of bringing up children, with 
furnishing the house, with the length and utilization of free time, etc. If 
politics are to bring about international socialism, they "must find the 
connection with the petty, banal, primitive, simple everyday life and wishes of 
the broadest mass of the people, in all the specificity of their situation in 
society".</p>

<p class="fst">Reich then turns to the "traditional allegiances" and to the 
"wishes, anxieties, ideas and thoughts" which inhibit the development of class 
consciousness. He points out that "political reaction, with Fascism and the 
Church at its head, demands of the working masses the renunciation of earthly 
happiness, obedience, propriety, abjuration and self-sacrifice". Reaction "grows 
politically fat from the fulfilment of these demands by the masses themselves". 
It bases itself "on the guilt feelings of every member of the proletariat, upon 
their usual unassuming moderation, upon their tendency to undergo privation with 
dumb willingness and sometimes even with joy". Reaction and the Church exploit 
the identification of the masses with the glorious Führer whose "love for the 
nation" is substituted for real satisfaction of popular needs.</p>

<p class="fst">Reich then comes to the kernel of his analysis. Revolutionaries 
must recognize that "the principle of renunciation is harmful, stupid and 
reactionary". "The principle of full earthly pleasure by which Reich does not 
mean "beer and skittles" must be set against the political reactionaries' 
principle of renunciation". 'The moderation of the "simple man", the prime 
virtue as far as Church and Fascism are concerned, is from the standpoint of 
socialism his greatest fault, one of the many elements which militate against 
his class consciousness." "<i>We are heading up a dead-end</i>", Reich writes, "<i>if 
we consider class consciousness an ethical quality</i>" and hence compete with 
the bourgeoisie and its agents on grounds of their choosing. It would not only 
be futile but harmful to condemn, for instance, "adolescent sexuality, the 
character of prostitutes, the depravity of the criminal and immorality of the 
thief. (Reich clearly differentiates this attitude from any "romantic admiration 
for the world of crime".) He points out that "everything which goes by the name 
of morality and ethics today stands unequivocally in the service of the 
oppression of working humanity". "Everything that supports and strengthens the 
bourgeois order and attaches people to it is an impediment to class 
consciousness". On the other hand "everything that is in contradiction with the 
bourgeois order, that contains the seeds of revolt, may be regarded as an 
element of class consciousness".</p>

<p class="fst">Reich warns that the right will exploit these "amoral" 
conceptions in its propaganda. This doesn't matter he says, for the right has 
anyway always considered the left as thieves (who want to expropriate the means 
of production). Failure to deal with these matters, or "holier than thou" 
attitudes on the part of the left will only drive the frustrated and 
misunderstood masses into the arms of reaction.</p>

<p class="fst">We have touched on this subject in previous issues of <i>
Solidarity</i>, perhaps without appreciating its full significance. In 
industrial struggles, for instance, there is nearly always a very strong urge 
among workers, to "make the dispute official", to project an image of being 
moderate, sensible people, acting constitutionally and within the framework of a 
procedure "agreed" by both sides. Instead of defending a sacked steward, as 
being a good militant, doing things that the trade union bureaucracy will not 
and cannot do, he is defended as "only implementing official union policy", etc.</p>

<p class="fst">From where do these conformist attitudes stem? Dealing with 
inhibiting influences, Reich stresses the importance of the early rebellion 
against the parents. "Sexual inhibition, the fear of sexual activity and the 
corresponding feelings of guilt are always either reactionary or at least 
inhibit revolutionary thinking. Sexual oppression is so immediately perceptible 
for the child - and class problems for the most part so alien to its thinking - 
that there is no question of a choice in this matter. Early, correct sexual 
knowledge does not merely create a lively attachment to the person giving it, 
does not merely destroy all the child's usual mistrust of adults, but 
constitutes in itself the best foundation for irreligious thinking and hence for 
class feeling". The ideological struggle against "being good" is seen by Reich 
as "one of the most important tasks on the ideological front". Attachment to the 
parents, on the other hand, is "a powerful, inhibiting element, which can never 
be exploited by revolutionaries in the interests of social revolution". Reich 
points out that these are class questions, not personal matters. The Church was 
well aware of all this, even if the revolutionaries, permeated by bourgeois 
inhibitions, were not. The Church was not afraid to discuss "these so-called 
taboo subjects. As far as <i>it</i> was concerned, children masturbating <i>was</i> 
a political matter". It required care and sensitivity to discuss these subjects 
with children. "Revolutionaries should at least not get in the way, by chiming 
in with the Church".</p>

<p class="fst">Reich then discusses such things as "parades, uniforms and 
military music", all seen as factors damaging the development of a critical 
consciousness. The Right would always be better than the Left at the game of 
pageantry, at creating myths and in mobilizing people around them. The task of 
the Left was to blend natural emotion with real understanding. This required 
patience and some insight into what went on in people's minds. It required 
understanding their unarticulated fears and doubts, the pressure to which they 
were submitted in the home or more generally outside of the work situation. "A 
worker can never be brought to <i>class</i> feeling by simply being called on to 
strike, as those obtuse individuals demand who do not know what goes on in a 
worker's mind." The message, here, is as relevant today as when first uttered 
nearly forty years ago. Honest discussion about <i>
all</i> aspects of life will, on the other hand gain workers to the 
revolutionary cause, "if not immediately for a strike, certainly for later, when 
such islands of comprehension of the psychology of the masses come together in 
suburbs, towns and provinces, and the feeling that there are people who know 
exactly what is preoccupying one, arousing one's indignation, holding one back, 
driving one on and at the same time restricting one begins to gather people like 
an avalanche".</p>

<p class="fst">In a passage of deep relevance to what might happen tomorrow 
Reich writes "that in the course of the last ten years adolescents, adults, men 
and women, people from every walk of life have passed through the revolutionary 
organizations without becoming attached or committed to the revolutionary 
cause". What drove them in, in the first place? "Not uniforms, not material 
advantage, merely vague socialist conviction, revolutionary feeling". Why did 
they not stay in? "Because the organizations failed to develop this 
revolutionary feeling". Why did people lapse into indifference, or go over to 
the Right? "Because there were bourgeois structures in them that were not 
destroyed". Why were they not destroyed? "Because nobody knew what to promote 
and what to destroy". The desired objective could not be achieved by appeals to 
discipline not even "by music and marching, for the others the Right could do 
that a lot better". Nor could it be done with slogans "for the political clamour 
of the others was better and more powerful". "The only thing which the 
revolutionary organizations could, <i>without competition</i>, have offered the 
masses and which in reality they did not offer ... would have been the <i>
knowledge</i> of what the uneducated, oppressed children of capitalism, 
hankering both after freedom and after authoritarian protection really wanted, 
without themselves being clearly aware of it". The revolutionaries should have 
put all this into words, and said it for the masses, in their own language, "but 
organizations which dismissed all psychology as counter-revolutionary were not 
up to such tasks". Underlying these formulations of Reich's are a number of very 
important matters (the role of intellectuals in the revolutionary movement, the 
importance of knowledge as a basis of self-activity, the growth of 
"consciousness", etc.) which we cannot here go into.</p>

<p class="fst">Among other interesting insights of Reich's one might mention his 
observations that organizations which saw themselves "the preordained leaders of 
the coming revolution" repelled people and would be swamped in the revolution 
itself. Reich also repeatedly stressed that revolutionary propaganda should be 
positive. It should not be frightened of discussing the future, as concretely as 
possible. Fear of revolution was partly the product of ignorance. The broad 
"apolitical" masses would have a decisive effect upon the fate of the 
revolution. Revolutionaries should therefore find them where they were. They 
should "politicize private life, fairs, dance halls, cinemas, markets, bedrooms, 
hostels and betting shops". Long before the Situationists (or <i>Solidarity</i>) 
came on the scene Reich had proclaimed that "revolutionary energy lies in 
everyday life".</p>

<p class="fst">This synopsis can only give a partial insight into the sort of 
problems Reich is dealing with. It should be enough, however, to cause serious 
revolutionaries to ask themselves a few questions about what they are <i>really</i> 
doing, about the emphases and priorities of their work, about the "triumphalist" 
myths some are so busy con-cocting and about the <i>lasting</i> content of their 
"interventions".</p>
