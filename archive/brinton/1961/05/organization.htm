<h3><a name="h1">1. "What is not to be done"</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The term "rethinking" is often used as an excuse for not thinking 
at all. One hesitates to use it. Much rethinking has nevertheless to be done by 
revolutionary socialists. A cursory glance at the Labour movement in Western 
Europe today should convince anyone of this dire need. More and more ordinary 
people show an indifference bordering on contempt for the mass Labour and 
Communist Parties of yesterday. The old men of the "left" attempt to resolve 
this crisis by repeating in ever more strident tone the dogmas and concepts that 
were good enough for their own grandads.</p>

<p class="fst">We here wish to examine one of the most fervently adhered to 
dogmas of the "Left": the need for a tightly centralized socialist party, 
controlled by a carefully selected leadership. The Labour Party describes this 
type of organization as an essential feature of British democracy in practice. 
The Bolsheviks describe it as a "democratic centralism". Let us forget the names 
and look below the surface. In both cases we find the complete domination of the 
party in all matters of organization and policy by a fairly small group of 
professional "leaders".</p>

<p class="fst">As none of these parties has ever been successful in achieving a 
society where the great mass of people control and manage their own destinies, 
both their politics and their organizational methods must be considered suspect. 
It is our opinion that the type of organization required to assist the working 
class in its struggle for socialism is certainly a matter for serious thought.</p>

<p class="fst">Post-war capitalism has certainly provided more jobs and better 
paid ones than many may have thought possible. But its drive to subordinate 
people to the process of production has intensified at an enormous rate. At 
work, people are reduced more and more to the role of button-pushing 
lever-pressing machines. In the "ideal" capitalist factory human beings would 
perform only the most simple, routine tasks. The division of labour would be 
carried to its extreme. Managers would decide. Foremen would supervise. The 
workers only comply.</p>

<p class="fst">In the body politic, omnipotent social institutions similarly 
decide all issues: how much production will be "allowed" to increase or 
decrease, how much consumption, what kind of consumption, how many H-bombs to 
produce, whether to have Polaris bases or not, etc., etc. Between those who rule 
and those who labour there exists a wide and unbridgeable gulf.</p>

<p class="fst">Exploiting society consciously encourages the development of a 
mass psychology to the effect that the ideas or wishes of ordinary people are 
unimportant and that all important decisions must be taken by people specially 
trained and specially equipped to do so. They are encouraged to believe that 
success, security, call it what you will, can only be achieved within the 
framework of the accepted institutions. The rebel, the militant, the iconoclast 
may be admired, even envied, but their example must be shunned. After all no one 
can really challenge the powers that be. Just look at what happens to those who 
try!</p>

<p class="fst">Ironically enough the very organizations that have set themselves 
up as the liberators of the working class and the champions of their cause have 
become facsimile replicas of the very society they are supposedly challenging. 
The Labour Party, the Communist Party and the various Trotskyite and Leninist 
sects all extol the virtues of professional politicians or revolutionaries. All 
practice a rigid division within their own organizations of leaders and led. All 
fundamentally believe that socialism will be instituted from above and through 
their own particular agency.</p>

<p class="fst">Each of them sees socialism as nothing more than the conquest of 
political power, and the transformation, by decree, of economic institutions. 
The instruments of socialism, in their eyes, are nationalization, state control 
and the "plan". The objective of socialism is to increase both productivity and 
consumption. The elimination of economic anarchy and the full development of the 
productive forces are somehow equated with the millennium.</p>

<p class="fst">Labour's nationalized industries are proof of the attitude of the 
Social Democrats. The Bolsheviks would replace the Robertsons and Robens with 
people loyal to the Party. The Soviet experience makes this quite clear. As 
early as 1918 Lenin had stated "the Revolution demands, in the interests of 
socialism, that the masses <i>unquestioningly obey the single will</i> of the 
leaders of the labour process".<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
By 1921 he was saying: "It is absolutely essential that all authority in the 
factories should be concentrated in the hands of management ... under these 
circumstances all direct interference by the trade unions in the management of 
factories must be regarded positively harmful and impermissible."<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky wanted to militarize the trade unions. Is it very far 
from this to the statement, issued by Stalin's Central Committee in September 
1929, that "Soviet Union Communists must help to establish order and discipline 
in the factory. Members of the Communist Party, union representatives and shop 
committees are instructed not to interfere in questions of management".<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">None of them argued for the working people themselves managing 
and organizing industry and the affairs of society, now. That was a carrot to be 
nibbled in a distant future.</p>

<p class="fst">This conception of socialism spawns the bureaucratic parties that 
today constitute the traditional political organizations of the "left". To all 
of them the determination and application of policies are a matter for experts. 
Gaitskell scorns the Scarborough decisions because they were made by people whom 
he considers to be intellectually incapable of comprehending matters of 
international importance. The Communist Party and the Socialist Labour League 
oppose British H-bombs but support Russian ones. Their leaders consider the 
millions of people who want to end <i>all</i> H-bombs as being sentimental and 
uninformed. They have obviously not read the appropriate volumes that would 
"clarify" them and make them see how essential Russian bombs really are.</p>

<p class="fst">The businessmen insist on the importance of their managerial 
rights. So do the leaders of the political organizations of the "Left". This 
rigid control from above creates not efficiency but the very reverse. Whenever 
decisions are taken at higher levels and simply transmitted to the lower orders 
for execution a conspiracy against both leaders and orders arises. In the 
factory the workers devise their own methods of solving work problems. If bonus 
can be made in five hours well and good. Work is skilfully spread over 
eight-and-a-half hours. Supervisors lie to departmental managers. These, in 
turn, lie to works' managers, who lie to the directors and shareholders. Each 
seeks to preserve his own niche. Each seeks to hide wastage, error, and 
inefficiency. In the hierarchical organization of the modern factory where work 
is not a matter for common decision and responsibility, and where relations are 
based on mistrust and suspicion, the best "plan" can never be fulfilled in life.</p>

<p class="fst">This is repeated in the political parties. Officials have an 
existence to justify. Members who are nothing more than contributors to party 
funds, and sellers of party literature are regularly called to order to explain 
how many papers they have sold and how many contacts they have visited with 
their leader's latest line. Those who attempt to discuss reality or to think for 
themselves are denounced as either "sectarians" or "opportunists" or just 
"politically immature". The factory managers never really know what is happening 
in their factories. The political "leaders" really don't know either what is 
taking place in their own organizations. Only the leaders, for instance, believe 
the membership figures issued.</p>

<p class="fst">Bolsheviks argue that to fight the highly centralized forces of 
modern capitalism requires an equally centralized type of party. This ignores 
the fact that capitalist centralization is based on coercion and force and the 
exclusion of the overwhelming majority of the population from participating in 
any of its decisions. The most highly specialized and centralized bodies under 
capitalism are its means of enforcing its rule - its military and its police. 
Because of their bureaucratic centralism these organizations produce a special 
breed of animal noted for its insensitiveness, brutality and other moronic 
qualities.</p>

<p class="fst">The very structure of these organizations ensures that their 
personnel do not think for themselves, but unquestionably carry out the 
instructions of their superiors. Trotsky, as far back as 1903, believed that the 
Marxist movement should have a similar structure. He told the Brussels 
Conference that the statutes of the revolutionary organization should express 
"the leadership's organized distrust of the members, a distrust manifesting 
itself in vigilant control from above over the Party".<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Advocates of "democratic centralism" insist that it is the only 
type of organization which can function effectively under conditions of 
illegality. This is nonsense. The "democratic centralist' organization is 
particularly vulnerable to police persecution. When all power is concentrated in 
the hands of the leaders, their arrest immediately paralyses the whole 
organization. Members trained to accept unquestioningly the instruction of an 
all-wise Central Committee will find it very difficult or impossible to think 
and act for themselves. The experiences of the German Communist Party confirm 
this. With their usual inconsistency, the Trotskyists even explain the demise of 
their Western European sections during World War II by telling people how their 
leaders were murdered by the Gestapo!</p>

<p class="fst">The overthrow of exploiting society is not a military operation 
to be planned by a secretariat of amateur generals, armed with a library of 
Marxist textbooks and an outdated military manual. A social revolution can only 
take place providing the working class itself is conscious of the need to change 
society and is prepared to struggle. Its success is dependent on the 
disintegration of the capitalist institutions more than on their military 
overthrow. Unless whole sections of the military can either be won over or 
neutralized, then the taking of power is impossible.</p>

<p class="fst">Because of their basically reactionary ideas and methods of 
organization neither social democracy nor Bolshevism are able to understand or 
express the real needs of people. The dynamic of any socialist movement is the 
desire of people to change the conditions of their lives. The Hungarian 
Revolution was more than a struggle for an extra ten bob a week. It was not a 
struggle for an extension of nationalization or for more "efficiency" in 
Government departments. Millions of Hungarian people rose against their 
oppressors because <i>they</i> wanted to determine the conditions of their own 
lives and to manage their own affairs. For a brief, heroic period they replaced 
the society of rulers and ruled with direct democracy, where every 
representative was not only elected by direct vote but was revocable at any 
time. The ideas of committees appointed from above and of "panels' commissions" 
would have been quite alien to them. Surely political tendencies whose 
organizational methods are the very antithesis of what the working class has 
demonstrated, in practice, that it wants, should re-examine all their ideas and 
previously held theories.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. Why?</a></h3>

<p class="fst">All the ruling groups in modern society encourage the belief that 
decision taking and management are functions beyond the comprehension of 
ordinary people. All means are used to foster this idea. Not only do formal 
education, the press, the radio, television and the church perpetuate this myth, 
but even the parties of the so-called opposition accept it and, in so doing, 
lend it strength. All the political parties of the "left" - whether social 
democratic or Bolshevik - oppose the present order only by offering "better" 
leaders, more "experienced" and more capable of solving the problems of society 
than those who mismanage the world today.</p>

<p class="fst">All of them, bourgeois and "radicals" alike, distort the history 
of the working class and attempt to draw a discreet veil over the immense 
creative initiative of the masses in struggle. For the bourgeois, the Russian 
revolution was the conspiracy of organized fanaticism. To Stalinists and 
Trotskyists, it is the justification for their right to lead. For the bourgeois, 
the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 showed how capitalist rulers were better than 
Stalinist ones. For the Stalinists, it was a fascist conspiracy. The Trotskyists 
wrote pamphlets showing how badly the Hungarians needed their own services. Over 
every revolution and struggle the parties compete in the squalid business of 
seeking to justify both themselves and their dogmas. They all ignore the 
efforts, the struggles, the sacrifices and the positive achievements of the 
participants themselves. Every attempt by people to take control of their own 
destiny by instituting their own rule has been buried beneath a million official 
tracts and a welter of "expert" interpretations.</p>

<p class="fst">It is now almost impossible to learn what actually happened in 
Italy during the early 1920s when the workers occupied and managed the 
factories. The Asturian Commune of 1934, the May Days in Barcelona in 1937, the 
sit-down strikes in France and the U.S.A. during the late thirties and the 
events of Budapest in 1956 have become closed books.</p>

<p class="fst">If the myth that people are unable to manage, organize and rule 
society themselves is to be debunked, workers must be made aware that on several 
occasions other workers have in fact managed society. They have done so both 
more humanely and more effectively than it is managed at present. To us who 
publish <i>Agitator</i> there can be no thought of socialism unless the working 
class establishes its own rule. Socialism for us implies the complete and total 
management of both production and government. The essential precondition for 
this is a rise in mass consciousness and the development of a confidence within 
people that they are able not only to challenge the old society but build the 
new one.</p>

<p class="fst">Making these past experiences available to people is one of the 
primary tasks of revolutionary socialists. All channels of information are in 
the hands of capitalists, bureaucrats, or self-appointed saviours with special 
axes to grind. We disagree with those who argue that there is no need for a 
revolutionary organization. The production of a truthful and a serious history 
requires the conscious and organized association of revolutionary socialists.</p>

<p class="fst">The revolutionary organization must also bring to workers' notice 
the common interests that they share with other workers.</p>

<p class="fst">On the one hand the concentration of capital has led to an 
increasing concentration of workers in giant factories often linked with one 
another in various kinds of monopolies. On the other hand the new productive 
techniques have led to greater division between the producers. The labour 
process has been so broken down that workers are not only separated by national, 
regional and sectional boundaries, but also by artificial divisions within 
factories and departments. The increasing tempo of production and introduction 
of piecework has fostered the idea that the interests of workers in one section 
are quite different from those of men in other sections.</p>

<p class="fst">The trade union officials help the employers to maintain these 
divisions. Separate and often widely differing wage and piece-rates are 
negotiated. Workers in one factory or shop are pitted against workers in other 
factories and shops. The employers and the union officials unscrupulously use 
the men's short-term interests - or apparent short-term interests - to sabotage 
their real needs. The very presence of different unions competing against one 
another for members illustrates how sectional interests are promoted above 
general requirements. Clerical workers are today being reduced to mere cogs in 
the impersonal machine of production. The increase in union membership among 
these workers shows that they are becoming aware of this fact. The union 
bureaucracies organize them into separate unions for white-collar workers, or 
into special sections of the industrial unions.</p>

<p class="fst">The revolutionary organization must help break down the false 
divisions between workers. With its paper and publications and through its 
militants the revolutionary organization should bring to people's notice the 
struggles that are taking place in society. It must truthfully report what these 
struggles are about and show how they affect the lives and interests of other 
workers.</p>

<p class="fst">Most people do not at present see the need for socialism. If by 
socialism is meant what currently passes as such - both East and West of the 
Iron Curtain - we can scarcely blame them. There is no doubt, however, that vast 
numbers of people are prepared to struggle on real issues, on issues that really 
concern them, and against the innumerable and monstrous social injustices and 
social frustrations of contemporary society. At an elementary level, they are 
prepared to fight against rent increases, against changes in piecework rates and 
against changes in job organization about which they have not even been 
consulted. At a higher level, they are prepared to campaign against the 
production of nuclear weapons. They are constantly challenging the various 
"solutions" to these problems, imposed upon them from above. How can this 
challenge be generalized? How can it be transformed into one directed against 
the very society which perpetuates the division of men into order-givers and 
order-takers?</p>

<p class="fst">The revolutionary organization must assist people engaged in a 
struggle against exploiting society to understand the need to act in an 
organized class way and not as isolated groups with limited or sectional 
objectives.</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<p class="fst">Is the socialist society a Utopian dream? The answer depends on 
how one sees the development of socialist consciousness. The Bolsheviks - 
Stalinists and Trotskyists - both endorse Lenin's statement: 'The history of all 
countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own efforts, is able 
to develop only trade union consciousness."<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The adherents to this theory, quite logically, consider it the 
job of professional revolutionaries to <i>plan</i> the strategy, <i>organize</i> 
the taking of power and take all the decisions for the instituting of the 
"socialist" society. Lenin, the firmest advocate of this reformist and 
reactionary idea which was borrowed from Kautsky<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> 
went so far as to applaud the Webbs' ironical and scornful comments about the 
attempts of the British workers to manage their own trade unions.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">We completely reject this idea. First, because it attempts to 
impose upon workers a relationship to "their" leadership which is a replica of 
the relation already existing under capitalism. The effect would only be to 
create apathy and the alienation of the masses - conditions which powerfully 
assist the growth of decision-taking groups, which rapidly assume increasing 
managerial functions and which however "well-intentioned" originally, rapidly 
start settling matters in their own interests and become exploiting groups and 
bureaucracies.</p>

<p class="fst">We believe that people in struggle <i>do</i> draw conclusions 
which are fundamentally socialist in content. Industrial disputes, particularly 
in Britain, frequently take on the character of a challenge to managerial 
rights. Workers constantly dispute the bosses' right to hire and fire. Strikes 
regularly take place over employers' attempts to reorganize and "rationalize" 
production. In these workers counterpoise their own conceptions and ideas of how 
production should be organized to those of the employers. Such disputes not only 
undermine the whole authoritarian, hierarchical structure of capitalist 
relations, they also show quite clearly that people are repeatedly seeing the 
need to organize production - which is the basis of all social life - as <i>they</i> 
think best.</p>

<p class="fst">During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 the Workers' Councils 
demanded drastic reductions in wage differentials, called for the abolition of 
piecework and introduced workers' management of industry. These organizations of 
political and industrial rule - far more important than the Nagy government - 
were based on elected and immediately revocable delegates.</p>

<p class="fst">The Hungarian Revolution followed the tradition first established 
by the Commune of 1871. But the aims of the Hungarian workers went further than 
those of any previous revolution. In the anti-bureaucratic nature of their 
demands the Hungarian workers showed that they were fighting for something which 
will become the fundamental feature of all workers' struggles in this epoch. 
Such a programme is far more revolutionary and more profoundly socialist in 
character than anything advocated by any of today's so-called socialist parties.</p>

<p class="fst">The Social Democrats and Bolsheviks look either to war or 
economic misery as means of converting to socialism. It is primitive and 
insulting to believe that people are unable to oppose exploiting society unless 
their bellies are empty or their heads about to be blown off.</p>

<p class="fst">That this is untrue is shown by the innumerable disputes which 
take place in the motor industry. Car workers - despite their relatively high 
wages - fight back against employers' attempts to establish an ever more rigid 
control over workshop conditions. Often employers are prepared to pay more money 
if workers will give up their hard-won rights in the workshops. Workers often 
reject this bribery.</p>

<p class="fst">Capitalist and bureaucratic societies both seek to subordinate 
the great majority to the needs of their ruling groups. The rulers attempt to 
impress the stamp of obedience and conformity on to every aspect of social life. 
Initiative, intellectual independence, creativeness are crushed and despised. 
Unless man can develop to the full these - his most precious qualities - he 
lives but half a life. Men want to be something more than well-fed servants. The 
desire to be free is not a pious liberal phrase, but the most noble of man's 
desires. The pre-condition of this freedom is, of course, freedom in the field 
of production - workers' management. There can be no real freedom and no real 
future for humanity in an exploiting society. The path to freedom lies through 
the socialist revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The resentment of people today against the stifling and degrading 
relations imposed upon them by class society provides the strongest driving 
force towards the socialist future.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">3. How?</a></h3>

<p class="fst">What type of organization is needed in the struggle for 
socialism? How can the fragmented struggles of isolated groups of workers, of 
tenants, of people opposed to nuclear war be co-ordinated? How can a mass 
socialist consciousness be developed?</p>

<p class="fst">In parts 1 and 2 we were quite emphatic about what we <i>didn't</i> 
want. We looked at all the traditional organizations and found both in their 
doctrine and in their structure mirror images of the very society they were 
allegedly fighting to overthrow. We would like now to develop some of our 
conceptions of what is needed.</p>

<p class="fst">Our suggestions are not blueprints. Nor are they intended as the 
ultimate and final word on the matter. The methods of struggle decided by the 
working class will to a large extent mould the revolutionary organization - that 
is, provided the organization sees itself as the instrument of these struggles 
and not as a self-appointed "leadership". "Elitist" conceptions lead to a 
self-imposed isolation. Future events may show us the need to modify or even 
radically alter many of our present conceptions. This does not worry us in the 
least. There is nothing more revolutionary than reality, nothing more 
reactionary than an erstwhile revolutionary idea promoted to the rank of 
absolute and permanent truth.</p>

<p class="fst">Exploiting society constantly seeks to coerce people into obeying 
its will. It denies them the right to manage their own lives, to decide their 
own destinies. It seeks to create obedient conformists. The real challenge of 
socialism is that it will give to men the right to be masters of their fate.</p>

<p class="fst">It seems quite obvious to us that the socialist organization must 
be <i>managed</i> by its members. Unless it can ensure that they work together 
in a spirit of free association and that their activity is genuinely collective 
it will be useless. It will appear to people as no different from any other 
organization or institution of capitalism, with its rigid division into 
order-givers and order-takers.</p>

<p class="fst">Without democracy the revolutionary organization will be unable 
to develop the required originality of thought and the vital initiative and 
determination to fight upon which its very existence depends. The Bolshevik 
method of self-appointed and self-perpetuating leaders, selected because of 
their ability to "interpret" the teachers' writings and "relate them to today's 
events" ensures that no one ever intrudes with an original idea. History becomes 
a series of interesting analogies. Thought becomes superfluous. All the 
revolutionaries need is a good memory and well-stocked library. No wonder the 
"revolutionary" left is today so sterile.</p>

<p class="fst">Struggle demands more than a knowledge of history. It demands of 
its participants an understanding of today's reality. During strikes, workers 
have to discuss in a free and uninhibited way how best to win. Unless this is 
made possible the ability and talent of the strikers is wasted. The loyalty and 
determination that strikers display - often referred to by the press as 
stubbornness or ignorance - derives from the knowledge that they have 
participated in the decisions. They have a feeling of identification with their 
strike and with its organization. This is in marked contrast to their general 
position in society where what they think and do is considered quite unimportant</p>

<p class="fst">During strikes, representatives of the various political groups 
gain control of the Committee. Demands entirely unrelated to the dispute then 
make their appearance. The outcome is inevitable. A lack of interest, a 
diminution of activity, sometimes even a vote to return to work. The feeling of 
identification disappears and is replaced by a feeling of being used.</p>

<p class="fst">When the direct management of an organization by its members is 
replaced by an alien control from above, vitality is lost, the will to struggle 
lessens. Many will ask what do we mean by "direct management"? We mean that the 
organization should be based upon branches or groups, each of which has the 
fullest autonomy, to decide its own activities, that is in keeping with the 
general purpose of the organization. When possible decisions should be 
collective ones. Branches should elect <i>delegates</i> to any committees 
considered necessary for the day-to-day functioning of the organization. Such 
delegates are not elected for three years, for twelve months ... or even twelve 
days. They are, <i>revocable</i>, <i>at any time</i> their fellow members 
consider it necessary. This is the only way that the membership can effectively 
ensure that their representatives carry out their jobs properly. We lay no 
claims to originality in proposing this. In every revolution, during most 
strikes and daily at the level of workshop organization the working class 
resorts to this type of direct democracy.</p>

<p class="fst">It is rather amusing to hear Bolsheviks argue that this may be 
all right for everybody else - but not for themselves. Apparently the same 
workers who are expected to have determination and consciousness sufficient to 
overthrow capitalism and to build a new society do not possess sufficient 
know-how to put the right man in the right place in their own organization.</p>

<p class="fst">The same arguments against direct democracy repeatedly raise 
their bald heads! We are reminded that you cannot have a mass meeting to discuss 
every single issue - true, but not very profound. Of course certain committees 
are needed. They must however be directly responsible to the membership, and 
their duties must be clearly defined. They must be charged with placing <i>all</i> 
the facts of any matter under discussion before all the members. The withholding 
of essential information from members is a powerful factor reinforcing the 
division between leaders and led. It lays the basis for bureaucracy within the 
organization. Genuine democracy does not only imply an equality of rights ... it 
implies the fullest possible dissemination of information, allowing the rational 
use of those rights.</p>

<p class="fst">We reject the idea that matters of great importance require split 
second decisions by a central committee, with "years of experience" to its 
credit, meeting in a secret conclave. If the social conflict is so intense as to 
require drastic action, the need for such action will certainly have become 
apparent to many workers. The organization will at best be the expression of 
that collective will. A million correct decisions are quite useless unless they 
are <i>understood</i> and <i>accepted</i> by those involved. People cannot fight 
blindly in such situations, their unthinking actions projected by a group of 
revolutionary theoreticians - if they do the results are liable to be dangerous.</p>

<p class="fst">When important decisions have to be taken they must be placed 
before the members for approval or otherwise. Without this there can be no 
understanding of what is involved. And without understanding there can be no 
conviction, and no genuinely effective action. There will only be the usual 
frantic appeals to "discipline". And as Zinoviev once put it: "discipline begins 
where conviction ends".</p>

<p class="fst">Our critics will ask us about differences of opinion within the 
organization. Should not the majority decisions be binding on all? The 
alternative, we are informed, is ineffectiveness. Again there are precedents to 
which we may refer: the real experiences of workers in struggle. During strikes 
and even more so during revolutions, big issues are at stake. Fundamental 
decisions have to be taken. In these circumstances the members will 
automatically expect of each other full and active participation. Those who do 
not give it will cut themselves off from the movement, will have no desire to 
remain members. It is quite another matter, however, to insist on the absolute 
acceptance of a party line on matters not calling for immediate decision and 
action. Those who wish an organization to be run on these lines have clearly 
assigned to themselves a divine right of interpretation. Only they know what is 
"correct", what is "in the best interest of the movement'.</p>

<p class="fst">This attitude is very widespread and is an important factor in 
the utter fragmentation of the revolutionary left today. Various sects, each 
claiming to be the elite, the one-and-only "genuine" Marxist group, fight 
furiously with one another, each quite certain that the fate of the working 
class, and of humanity at large, is tied up with "finding the correct solution" 
to each and every doctrinal squabble. Faction fights and the "elite" conception 
of the Party (the "brain" of the working class) are but different sides of the 
same coin. This conception profoundly underestimates the creative abilities of 
the working class. No wonder they reject this type of organization ... and this 
type of politics.</p>

<p class="fst">What should the activity of the revolutionary organization be? 
Whilst rejecting the substitutionism of both reformism and Bolshevism, we also 
reject the essentially propagandist approach of organizations such as the 
Socialist Party of Great Britain. We consider it important to bring to workers 
information and reports of the struggles of other workers - both past and 
present - reports which emphasize the fact that workers <i>are</i> capable of 
struggling collectively and of rising to the greatest heights of revolutionary 
consciousness. The revolutionary press must help break down the conspiracy of 
silence about such struggles. It must bring to the working class the story of 
its own past and the details of its present struggles. But it must do more than 
merely disseminate information. When strikes occur, when tenants oppose rent 
increases, when thousands protest against the threat of nuclear war, we feel it 
our responsibility to provide the maximum support and assistance. The 
revolutionary organization or its members should actively participate in these 
movements, not with the idea of "gaining control" or "winning them over" to a 
particular line - but with the more honest objective of helping people in 
struggle to win.</p>

<p class="fst">This does not absolve conscious revolutionaries from arguing for 
their own ideas or from the need to try and convince people of the wider 
implications of their struggles. We do not "bow to spontaneity".<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> 
We believe we have something positive to say but also that we must earn our 
right to say it. The revolutionary organization must see its job as serving the 
working class, not leading it, helping co-ordinate its struggles, not imposing 
methods of struggle upon it, learning from the struggles that are taking place, 
not ramming <i>its</i> learning down the throat of others. It must realize that 
correct as its ideas may be, they are dependent on workers agreeing with them.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> In <i>Neue Zeit</i>, 1901 
-1902, XX, No.3, p. 79, Kautsky wrote: "... socialist consciousness is 
represented as a necessary and direct result of the proletarian class struggle. 
This is absolutely untrue ... Modem socialist consciousness can arise only on 
the basis of profound scientific knowledge ... the vehicles of science are not 
the proletariat but the bourgeois intelligentsia ..." Lenin, in <i>What Is To Be 
Done?</i> (p. 40), quotes Kautsky in full and refers to his views as "profoundly 
true and important utterances".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a> Lenin wrote (<i>ibid.</i> p. 
125): "In Mr. and Mrs. Webb's book on trade unionism, there is an interesting 
chapter entitled 'Primitive Democracy'. In this chapter, the authors relate how, 
in the first period of existence of their unions, the British workers thought it 
was an indispensable sign of democracy for all the members to do all the work of 
managing the unions; not only were all questions decided by the votes of all the 
members but all the official duties were fulfilled by all the members in turn. A 
long period of historical experience was required to teach these workers how 
absurd such a conception of democracy was and to make them understand the 
necessity for representative institutions on the one hand, and <i>for full-time 
professional officials on the other</i>".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n8" href="#fn8">[8]</a> Most discussions on this 
theme are quite meaningless. All mass struggles have both immediate and remote 
causes and all are influenced to a greater or less degree by the experiences of 
previous struggles.</p>
