<h3><a name="h1">The Commune ... from Marx to Trotsky</a></h3>

<p class="fst">"Each time we study the history of the Commune we see something 
new in it, thanks to the experiences gained in later revolutionary struggles 
..." Thus wrote Trotsky in 1921, in his preface to a book by Talès<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
which was to become basic reading for a whole generation of French 
revolutionaries.</p>

<p class="fst">The "tricks of History", as Marx delighted to call them, <i>have</i> 
amply confirmed the correctness of Trotsky's statement. We can now examine the 
Paris Commune in a new light - in the light precisely of the rich experience of 
Bolshevism and of Trotskyism. We mean, more specifically, in the light of their 
failure. Stated more concretely, the proletarian revolution of 1871 must now be 
re-evaluated in the light of the degeneration of the Russian Revolution and of 
the positive lessons of the revolutionary struggle of the Hungarian Workers' 
Councils in 1956 against bureaucratic society in which the means of production 
were completely "nationalized".</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky could hardly have forseen these developments when he 
wrote his prophetic words in the heroic days of 1921. This however in no way 
detracts from their absolute correctness.</p>

<p class="fst">For Trotsky and Talès the great defect of the Commune was the 
absence of a revolutionary leadership. "The Commune", Trotsky emphasized, shows 
us "the incapacity of the masses to choose their own path, their indecision in 
the leadership of the movement, their fatal inclination to stop after the first 
successess ..." How can this be overcome? Trotsky is quite explicit: "It is only 
through the help of the Party, basing itself on the whole history of the past, 
theoretically forseeing the paths of development and all its stages, and 
extracting from them the necessary formulas for action, that the proletariat 
frees itself from the need constantly to restart its own history ..." He 
summarizes his views with his usual logic: "We can look, page by page, through 
the history of the Commune. We will find in it <i>only a single lesson</i>: 
there must be a strong Party leadership" (our emphasis).</p>

<p class="fst">The present generation of revolutionaries have lived through or 
studied the history of the last forty years, and have experienced all the ills 
that have flown from the hypertrophy and subsequent degeneration of such a 
"leadership"- even when it has proved victorious in its struggle against the 
bourgeoisie. They have witnessed its gradual separation from the masses and its 
steady conversion into a ruling group, as fundamentally opposed to the basic 
wishes of the masses themselves to administer society as any previous ruling 
group in history. For revolutionaries in 1961 the Paris Commune of 1871 should 
be seen as an historical precursor of the essentially anti-bureaucratic mass 
movement that swept through Hungary in 1956. The measures taken by the 
Communards to prevent the emergence of a bureaucracy from within their own ranks 
were to be taken up again by the Budapest workers in 1956. Both revolutions 
posed the question of who was in reality to manage both production and society 
in no uncertain terms.</p>

<p class="fst">It is interesting to contrast the Bolshevik appreciation of the 
Commune with that of the Commune's great contemporaries, Marx and Engels. In his 
<i>Civil War in France</i>, written as the last Communards were being slaughtered 
by the forces of the victorious Versaillese, Marx does not once attribute the 
defeat to the absence of a "strong Party leadership". He is vastly impressed by 
its great positive achievements. He describes the Commune as "essentially a 
working class government, the produce of the struggle of the producing against 
the appropriating class, the political form, at last discovered, under which to 
work out the economic emancipation of Labour". He does not say that it was the 
Party who discovered this particular form, a form which neither he nor any other 
member of the First International had either forseen or prepared for. The masses 
in struggle <i>themselves</i> created this form of organization, just as in 1905 
they were themselves to create the Soviets, at first denounced by the Bolsheviks 
as "sectarian organizations". There is no question of the Party, or anyone else 
for that matter, "theoretically foreseeing the paths of development and all its 
stages ..." Twenty years later, in 1891, Engels was to write, "what is still 
more wonderful is the correctness of much that was done by the Commune, composed 
as it was of Blanquists and Proudhonists".<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
In other words the everyday experience of the masses impelled them to take 
measures of a class character. They generated their own socialist consciousness, 
assisted but not dictated to by conscious revolutionaries of various kinds.</p>

<p class="fst">The Commune was militarily crushed, having held power for just 
over two months. Its defeat was an extremely bloody one. It is scarcely 
surprising that Trotsky, president in October 1917 of the Revolutionary War 
Committee in Petrograd, brilliant military strategist and creator of the Red 
Army, should have been exasperated by the Commune's lack of military success, by 
its vacillations, by the "inefficiency" of a number of its leaders and by its 
total lack of a clearly thought-out military policy, when confronted by a 
cynical bourgeoisie prepared ruthlessly to destroy it and "to restore order for 
a generation".</p>

<p class="fst">What is less permissible however is that the same Trotsky should 
have lent military authority to Talès's effort systematically to denigrate the 
most creative and positive aspects of the Paris Commune. But the real culprit 
here is not even Talès. It is Bolshevism and Trotskyism themselves. If, as they 
tell us, "the crisis of society is the crisis of the revolutionary leadership", 
it is easy to equate the history of the Commune with the history of its 
leadership. From this postulate everything flows quite logically ... and in 
particular the defeat of the Commune! Or so they would have us believe!</p>

<p class="fst">History, on this basis, becomes an easy subject. The social 
composition and the prevailing ideologies of the Central Committee of the 
National Guard<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> and of the Commune 
itself were extremely diverse. The predominating influence was that of the 
radical, patriotic, anti-clerical petty-bourgeoisie. The members of the First 
International lacked ideological clarity. The Blanquists, the most determined 
revolutionaries and the ones most prepared to struggle, lacked any positive 
social conceptions. To these facts should be added the backward structure of the 
Parisian proletariat of the time. Industrial concentration, which had been 
achieved many years previously in the textile mills of Manchester and which was 
to be achieved some decades later by the Russian proletariat in the great 
Putilov works in Petrograd, was only just beginning in Paris.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But such an emphasis on the leadership of the Commune immediately 
leads to an insoluble contradiction. If history is an account of the 
achievements or shortcomings of revolutionary leaderships, how can we explain 
that the Commune, with its petty-bourgeois leadership, was capable of 
introducing to the modern world the most advanced conceptions of proletarian 
democracy? Why did Marx refer to it as "the glorious harbinger of a new 
society"? Why did Engels state that the measures taken by the Communards would, 
in the last resort, have led "to the abolition of class antagonism between 
capitalists and workers"? Why did he taunt the Social-Democratic philistines 
with his famous "Look at the Paris Commune. That was the Dictatorship of the 
Proletariat!"</p>

<p class="fst">The Commune introduced the eligibility and revocability of all 
officials and the payment to them of working men's salaries. These are 
profoundly revolutionary measures. Their application will inevitably undermine 
and destroy any bourgeois (or bureaucratic) state machine. These demands 
introduce complete popular domination of the civil administration, of the army 
and of the judiciary. They lead to the creation, from below, of a completely new 
kind of social organization. The October Revolution, in its early days, sought 
to implement these demands. The developing Stalinist bureaucracy sought 
ruthlessly to destroy them. Nearly a century after they were first put forward 
by the Communards, they still form the basis of all genuinely revolutionary 
struggles.</p>

<p class="fst">Marx stated that the Communards had "stormed heaven". Talès 
explains that the story of the Commune is the story of the failure of a 
radical-anarchist-petty-bourgeois leadership! His "explanation" is also peddled 
today by the crudest of Stalinists. This is no accident. In March 1961, during 
the ninetieth anniversary celebrations in Paris, Garaudy, Stalinist senator for 
the Seine department and university pen-pusher in the cause of Stalinism 
(completely unknown in England ... and rightly so), declared: 'The great lesson 
of the Commune is that the working class can only overcome its enemies under the 
leadership of a revolutionary party. It is essential to grasp this fundamental 
precondition of revolutionary victories at a time when some people under the 
pretext of a creative development of Marxism-Leninism are leading us back to the 
worst illusions of pre-Marxist socialism, to petty bourgeois anarchism, to 
Proudhonism, or to Blanquist adventurism ..." Sundry Trotskyists and 
non-Trotskyist Leninists would agree with every word of this.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> 
In so doing they reveal themselves worthy successors of those Marx castigated as 
"mere bawlers, who by dint of repeating year after year the same set of 
stereotyped declamations ... have sneaked into the reputation of revolutionists 
of the first water".</p>

<p class="fst">How did it come about, we would ask these gentlemen (or at least 
those of them who refuse to accept that Russia is not in any sense a socialist 
society) that in the twentieth Century <i>all</i> revolutionary movements, 
despite their repeated victories over and expropriations of the bourgeoisie, and 
despite the drastic changes they have introduced in the <i>property relations</i>, 
have failed to bring about socialism, that is a fundamental change in the 
<i>relations of production</i>, in the relation of man to man in his labour and in 
his social life?</p>

<p class="fst">To answer this question one needs a very different conception of 
history than that of Talès or of the Bolsheviks. A serious study of the Commune, 
which we cannot here undertake in full, will suggest some of the answers. The 
real history of the Commune is the history of the masses themselves, struggling 
for fundamentally different conditions of existence, and not primarily the 
history of leadership. Seen in this light the history of the Commune has still 
to be written.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">The Commune: A creation of the people.</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The workers, artisans and ordinary people of the period did not 
conceive of social life, least of all their own, in terms of universal concepts, 
but in terms of action. Nine workers out of ten still do so today. Action is 
their language. It is in fact the only language of which they have acquired 
complete mastery. For intellectuals words are often a substitute for action. For 
workers, actions are a form of speech. To add to revolutionary theory in the 
course of revolutionary action is the essential task of the revolutionary 
proletariat.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> This was the 
immortal contribution to revolutionary theory of the Parisian workers in 1871 
and of their successors, the Hungarian workers of 1956. Such was the language of 
the Commune, which socialists must now attempt to decipher.</p>

<p class="fst">The decisive date in the history of the Commune is March 18, 
1871. Thiers sees the armed workers of Paris as his main obstacle to the 
conclusion of a peace treaty with Bismarck, and as a potential danger for the 
whole of bourgeois France. He decides to send "loyal" battalions to remove the 
cannons held by the National Guard at Montmartre, Buttes Chaumont and 
Belleville, cannons bought by public subscription during the siege. The 
operation starts successfully in the early hours of the morning. After a little 
firing the guns at Montmartre are captured. But time passes. The operation has 
been bureaucratically and inefficiently planned. The necessary gun-carriages 
don't arrive to remove the captured guns. The crowd begins to grow. Women, 
children, old people mingle with the troops. The National Guard, hastily 
summoned, arrives. An extraordinary confusion reigns. Some soldiers of the 88th 
Regiment start talking to the Guard. When General Lecomte, losing his head, 
orders his troops to open fire, it is already too late. The soldiers refuse to 
fire, turn their rifle butts up, join with the people. The language of acts has 
been heard. Soldiers and civilians have fraternized.</p>

<p class="fst">But acts have a logic of their own. The soldiers have compromised 
themselves. They take General Lecomte as a hostage. A little late General 
Thomas, "the butcher of 1848", is spotted in the crowd. Tempers mount. Both 
generals are shot by their own soldiers.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thiers orders the withdrawal from the town of the standing Army. 
There is a precipitous retreat, in complete confusion, to Versailles. The major 
part of the civilian administration, government officials, senior officials in 
charge of food supplies, of the post, of lighting, of sewerage, of public 
assistance, of public health and of the thousand and one other aspects of life 
in a big city, leave Paris precipitously in the course of the next few days. An 
enormous social vacuum is created. Everything has to be created anew, from next 
to nothing, from below. And a war has to be fought at the same time.</p>

<p class="fst">We must dispose of the myth, which has gained much credence in 
Bolshevik circles, that alone a revolutionary Party would have had the "correct 
answers" at such a moment. "If there had been in Paris a Party leadership", 
Trotsky wrote, "it would have incorporated in the retreating armies ... a 
hundred or a few dozen devoted workers giving them the following directives: 
work up the discontent of the soldiers against their officers and take advantage 
of the first psychologically favourable moment to break the soldiers from their 
officers and bring them back to Paris to unite with the people".</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky speaks here with the wisdom of hindsight and somewhat 
distorts the real facts. Talès himself tells us that "March 18 ... started by 
the collective and anonymous action of the masses and ended in acts of 
individual initiative, isolated militants rallying the support of (local) 
committees of the National Guard". On March 19 leading Blanquists such as Eudes 
and Duval "proposed an immediate march on Versailles" but their proposals 
"encountered no echo on the Central Committee". A far-sighted minority <i>had</i> 
a fairly clear idea of what was required. That the majority were not at that 
stage prepared to follow their advice was a regrettable fact, but was also an 
objective element in the real situation. To argue that "if there had been a 
revolutionary Party, this or that would have followed" is like arguing that "if 
my aunt had ... she would be my uncle".</p>

<p class="fst">What of the creative activity of the Commune? What were its 
prevailing moods and the level of consciousness of it participants? These are 
clearly enumerated in Engels's 1891 introduction to Marx's <i>Civil War in 
France</i>. We don't apologize for reproducing the relevant passage, in full:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"On March 30 the Commune abolished conscription and the 
standing army, and declared the sole armed force to be the National Guard, in 
which all citizens capable of bearing arms were to be enrolled. It remitted all 
payments of rent for dwelling houses from October 1870 until April, the amounts 
already paid to be booked as future rent payments, and stopped all sales of 
articles pledged in the municipal loan office. On the same day the foreigners 
elected to the Commune were confirmed in office, because 'the flag of the 
Commune is the flag of the World Republic'. On April 1 it was decided that the 
highest salary to be received by any employee of the Commune, and therefore also 
by its members themselves, was not be exceed 6,000 francs ... On the following 
day the Commune decreed the separation of the church from the state, and the 
abolition of all state payments for religious purposes as well as the 
transformation of all church property into national property; as a result of 
which, on April 8, the exclusion from the schools of all religious symbols, 
pictures, dogmas, prayers - in a word, 'of all that belongs to the sphere of the 
individual's conscience' - was ordered and gradually put into effect. On the 
5th, in reply to the shooting, day after day, of captured Commune fighters by 
the Versailles troops, a decree was issued for the imprisonment of hostages, but 
it was never carried into execution. On the 6th, the guillotine was brought out 
by the 137th battalion of the National Guard, and publicly burnt, amid great 
popular rejoicing. On the 12th, the Commune decided that the Viceroy Column on 
the Place Vendome, which had been cast from captured guns by Napoleon after the 
war of 1809, should be demolished as a symbol of chauvinism and incitement to 
national hatred. This was carried out on May 16. On April 16 it ordered a 
statistical tabulation of factories which had been closed down by the 
manufacturers, and the working out of plans for the operation of these factories 
by the workers formerly employed in them, who were to be organized in 
co-operative societies, and also plans for the organization of these 
co-operatives in one great union. On the 20th it abolished night work for 
bakers, and also the employment offices, which since the Second Empire had been 
run as a monopoly by creatures appointed by the police - labour exploiters of 
the first rank; these offices were transferred to the mayoralties of the twenty 
<i>arrondissements</i> of Paris. On April 30 it ordered the closing of the 
pawnshops, on the ground that they were a private exploitation of the workers, 
and were in contradiction with the right of the workers to their instruments of 
labour and to credit. On May 5 it ordered the razing of the Chapel of Atonement, 
which had been built in expiation of the execution of Louis XVI.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Thus from March 18 onwards the class character of the Paris 
movement, which had previously been pushed into the background by the fight 
against the foreign invaders, emerged sharply and clearly. As almost only 
workers, or recognized representatives of the workers, sat in the Commune, its 
decisions bore a decidedly proletarian character."</p>

<p class="fst">The Commune was born of the exasperation provoked by the 
prolonged siege of Paris and of the disgust engendered by its capitulation 
without a fight. Nationalist or even chauvinist feeling might have been strong 
in the Paris of 1871. Yet the Commune "admitted all foreigners to the honour of 
dying for an immortal cause" and made a German working man, Leo Frankel, its 
Minister of Labour. It "honoured the heroic sons of Poland<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> 
by placing them at the head of the defenders of Paris" (Marx).</p>

<p class="fst">Much has been made by the advocates of the "hegemony of the 
Party" of the fact that few, if any, of the social measures taken by the Commune 
were <i>consciously socialist</i> ones. To accept that they were would of course 
deny the exclusive function of the Party, that of bringing "socialist 
consciousness" to the working class. What did the Communards think of their own 
activities? The very first proclamation of the Central Committee of the National 
Guard, on March 18, said: 'The proletarians of Paris, amidst the failures and 
treasons of the ruling class, have understood that the hour has struck for them 
to save the situation, <i>by taking into their own hands</i> the direction of 
public affairs ... they have understood that it is their imperious duty and 
their absolute right <i>to render themselves masters of their own destinies</i>, 
by seizing upon the governmental power". We would suggest that this reveals an 
extremely high degree of political consciousness, a degree which was to be 
achieved again by the Hungarian workers of 1956. One of the essential reasons of 
the degeneration of the Russian revolution was that the Russian masses were 
unable to sustain this degree of revolutionary consciousness for more than a few 
months. Under the mistaken idea that they could "leave it to the Party" which 
they themselves had created out of their flesh and blood, they retreated from 
the historical arena. The bureaucratic degeneration set in, with the Party as 
its nucleus.</p>

<p class="fst">Marx himself was aware of the importance of self-conscious 
activity. He refers to "the new era of history" which the Commune "was conscious 
of initiating". The great positive achievements of the Commune were no isolated 
or artificial gestures, but were measures reflecting the popular will and 
determined by it. Talès, our "Bolshevik" historian, makes fun of the love of the 
masses, at the time, for what he calls "symbolic acts". To illustrate his point 
he quotes the destruction of the monuments. This is because he has never 
understood this language of acts, through which ordinary people express 
themselves. When it pulled down the Vendome column, which Marx referred to as a 
"colossal symbol of martial glory", the crowd was expressing in actions the very 
notion which completes internationalism, namely anti-militarism.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">The Meaning of the Commune</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Almost every measure taken by the Commune can be explained 
through an understanding of the deepest daily experiences of the masses. Such 
was the decree limiting to 6,000 francs a year the top salary paid to any member 
of the revolutionary government (incidentally, such a salary was in practice 
never received by anyone). Such also was the decree stipulating that workshops 
abandoned by the employers should be taken over by the working class 
organizations and run by them, for the workers themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">These two measures were among the most characteristic taken by 
the Commune. Bolsheviks have argued interminably on the compensation clause. 
Today we realize how academic such a discussion really is. What the workers felt 
at the time was the importance of themselves <i>managing</i> production and 
distribution. As long as <i>they</i> managed what mattered indemnity to the 
previous owners, an indemnity whose effects would be restricted in time anyway? 
Ninety years later the Chinese bureacracy was to discover all this anew ... and 
in its own interests. Having bureaucratically ensured to itself the effective 
management of industry, it allowed itself the luxury of compensating - and even 
at times even of employing - the previous owners as salaried executives!</p>

<p class="fst">Marx was quite conscious of these deep-going aspects of the 
Commune. "When the Paris Commune took the <i>management</i> of the revolution in 
its own hands", he wrote, "when plain working men for the first time dared to 
infringe upon the governmental privilege of their 'natural superiors' and under 
circumstances of unexampled difficulty performed their work modestly, 
conscientiously and efficiently ... the old world writhed in convulsions of rage 
at the sight of the Red Flag, the symbol of the Republic of Labour, floating 
over the Hôtel de Ville". The distance separating <i>this</i> evaluation of the 
role of the Commune and that of Trotsky who saw the "only lesson" of the Commune 
to be the need for "a strong Party leadership" could hardly be greater!</p>

<p class="fst">As for the strivings of the Commune towards an equalization of 
wages, and its demands for the eligibility and revocability of all 
representatives, they reflect a fundamental preoccupation with the question of 
destroying <i>at its very roots</i> the hierarchical organization of society.</p>

<p class="fst">Since then much has been written and said about "Soviets" and 
about "workers' councils". But it would seem that the real nature of these new 
forms of social life has been forgotten by those who stand in admiration before 
their bureaucratic caricatures. Discussing the Commune, Marx wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Instead of deciding once in three or six years which member 
of the ruling class was to misrepresent the people in Parliament, universal 
suffrage was to serve the people, constituted in Communes, as individual 
suffrage serves every other employer in the search for workmen and managers in 
his business. And it is well known that companies, like individuals, in matters 
of real business generally know how to put the right man in the right place, 
and, if they for once make a mistake, to redress it promptly ... Nothing could 
be more foreign to the spirit of the Commune than to supersede universal 
suffrage by hierarchic investiture."</p>

<p class="fst">"Hierarchic investiture"! Here is the hub of the whole problem. 
How is the hierarchical structure of society to be destroyed and superseded? The 
Commune showed in its <i>acts</i> how this was to be done. At <i>all</i> levels, 
<i>all</i> officials and functionaries were to be elected. And <i>all</i> were to 
be removable by those who elected them!</p>

<p class="fst">Direct election and permanent revocability are clearly not 
panaceas for the solution of all problems. But in themselves they carry the seed 
of the most profound transformation of society. An officer or a magistrate whom 
one elects and whom one controls <i>at all times</i> is already no longer fully 
an officer or a magistrate. This is the yardstick by which one can begin to 
measure the "withering away of the state". The real content of this withering 
away is precisely the progressive elimination of hierarchical investiture and of 
hierarchical institutions.</p>

<p class="fst">Engels was quite emphatic on this question. Again referring to 
the Commune he stated "the working class must ... safeguard itself against its 
own deputies and officials, by declaring them <i>all</i>, <i>without exception</i>, 
subject to recall at any moment" (our emphasis).</p>

<p class="fst">There has been much misunderstanding about the significance of 
the "communal" regime, some of it patently dishonest. Thus Trotsky, correctly 
criticizing some of the leaders of the Commune, could give vent to his sarcasm: 
"Paris, you see, is but one commune among many others. Paris does not wish to 
impose anything on anyone. Paris does not struggle for a dictatorship other than 
'the dictatorship of example' ". But he continues quite wrongly: "The Commune 
was but an attempt to replace the developing proletarian revolution by a 
petty-bourgeois reform: communal autonomy. This idealist chatter, of the type 
indulged in by parlour anarchists, was in reality a cover for cowardice when 
confronted with revolutionary action, which needed to be carried out ceaselessly 
and to the end ..."<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> Marx had seen 
deeper than this. He pointed out that the Commune had (already in May 1871!) 
been subjected to a "multiplicity of interpretations" but that its essential 
features were that it was "a working class government" and "a thoroughly 
expansive political form, while all previous forms of government had been 
emphatically repressive".</p>

<p class="fst">The most significant aspect, however, of the Paris Commune is 
that it created social forms which in a sense define socialism itself, social 
forms which serve as yardsticks for proletarian revolutions passed, present and 
to come. These forms provide criteria for analyzing the social nature of any 
particular regime. Nearly a century later, societies can still be looked at 
according to categories established by the Paris Commune. And it is most 
revealing how clearly things fall into proper perspective when one confronts the 
Russian or Chinese realities of today with the first, short, hesitant experience 
in 1871 of a genuinely proletarian revolution and of genuine working class 
power.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">Paris 1871-Hungary 1956</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 is seen in a completely new 
light when looked at with the proletarian experience of 1871 in mind.</p>

<p class="fst">There are both superficial and deep analogies. The central facts 
of the Hungarian Revolution were firstly the active participation of the masses 
and secondly the anti-bureaucratic and anti-hierarchical character of the most 
spontaneous and deepest-going demands of the working class, demands which 
emerged more and more clearly as the Workers' Councils became the sole 
revolutionary force, in the later stages of the struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">In the first stages of both revolutions one sees the civilian 
crowds, women, children, old people, massively erupt on to the scene. Their 
total participation paralyzes for a while the intervention of the enemy. In both 
revolutions temporary conditions exist for genuine fraternization.</p>

<p class="fst">The Hungarian workers in 1956 immediately put forward demands for 
workers' management of the factory, for a drastic reduction in the wage 
differential and for the abolition of piece-rates. Like the Parisians they get 
straight down to essentials. Managers are elected and submitted to continuous, 
direct control. It matters less, in this respect, that a number of the previous 
managers were re-elected. What is essential is the radical transformation of all 
existing relations between men.</p>

<p class="fst">On a more tragic plane, in their fate each revolution resembles 
one another. In both cases it is a desperate, bitter struggle, fought out street 
by street, to the last drop of blood, without compromise, without submission, as 
only men can fight who know what they are fighting for and who have themselves 
determined the objectives of their struggle. Despite military defeat, which the 
revolutionaries in both circumstances came to see as more or less inevitable, it 
was a timeless ideal they fought for, an ideal to be defended unconditionally, 
in a fight in which inevitable death was almost welcomed as a release.</p>

<p class="fst">In both revolutions the threatened classes resorted to bloody 
repression. This was done with the calculated ferocity which ruling classes only 
resort to when their most fundamental prerogative is threatened, namely their 
right to rule. The iron fist then emerges from the velvet glove. Class society 
reveals itself in its true colours - as the perpetual, systematized, 
organization of violence by the minority against the immense majority. That 
Thiers was "more liberal" than Napoleon III is about as relevant in this respect 
as the fact that Khrushchev was "more liberal" than Stalin.</p>

<p class="fst">During both civil wars moreover, bystanders stood cynically on 
the side lines (Bismarck and Eisenhower) protesting at the use of so much 
violence, and forgetting that this class violence was but an image of their own.</p>

<p class="fst">The tragic defeat of the Hungarian Revolution, like the tragic 
defeat of the Commune, both call for reflection. Their lessons are innumerable. 
The need for an efficient co-ordination and for an organization capable of 
ensuring it should be obvious to all. But what kind of organization? How is it 
to be evolved? What are its relationships to the masses? <i>This</i> is the 
whole question. When we speak of organization we mean an organization evolved 
through struggle by the communes, by the Soviets, by the workers' councils 
themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">In his preface to the book by Talès, mentioned at the beginning, 
Trotsky wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Before the broad masses of the soldiers can acquire the 
experience of well choosing and selecting commanders, the revolution will be 
beaten by the enemy, who is guided in the choice of his commanders by the 
experience of centuries. The methods of amorphous democracy (<i>simple 
eligibility</i>) <i>must be supplemented and to a certain degree replaced by 
measures of selection from above</i>. The revolution must create an organ 
composed of experienced, reliable organizers in which one<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> 
can have absolute confidence, and give it full powers to choose, designate and 
educate the command."</p>

<p class="fst">In this last quotation from Trotsky two little words epitomize, 
in a way, the whole subsequent degeneration of the great proletarian revolution 
of 1917: the words "from above". No one denies the need for selection, 
particularly in so crucial a field as the field of armed struggle, to which the 
whole fate of the revolution is tied. Obviously the command must be selected. 
Training, aptitudes, experiences vary enormously. The proletarian heritage is 
heterogeneous in the extreme. But it is a question of selection <i>from below</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Selection from above has a remarkable tendency to transform 
itself from the exception to the rule. It is carried over, by its own momentum, 
from wartime into peace time. It spreads from the regiment into the factory. 
From the barracks it invades the factories involved in war work and the workers' 
councils themselves. From the military "High Command" it takes a brisk step into 
the "High Command" of the Party. It becomes systematized. It becomes the 
"hierarchic investiture" of which Marx spoke and which is one of the essential 
features of all class society. And as the principle proceeds on its way the 
masses soon retreat from the historical arena, leaving it to others who "are 
more efficient", who "know better" to act "on their behalf". The degeneration 
has begun. The seeds of the Stalinist regime are sown: the co-option of 
bureaucracy by the bureaucracy itself. Engels was almost prophetic in his 
foresight when he insisted that "<i>all</i> officials, <i>without exception</i>, 
must be subject to recall <i>at any moment</i>".</p>

<p class="fst"><i>A</i> new generation of young revolutionaries must now 
seriously turn the lessons of the Paris Commune and the lessons of the great 
contemporary analogue, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Scattered, 
misinterpreted, deliberately misused for ends that are not the ends of the 
Revolution, the basic documents of both are to be found<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> 
by those wishing to find them. They should be studied. Both revolutions are of 
fundamental importance to the socialist movement, and to an understanding of the 
class struggle in our epoch.</p>

elected and revocable representatives which took over the defence of Paris, 
first against the armies of Bismarck, then against those of Thiers, the most

<p class="endnote"><a name="n4" href="#fn4">[4]</a> "In 1886, at the apogee of 
Parisian expansion in this period, the total population was 1,825,274. There 
were 570, 280 workshops (as against 64,816 in 1847 and 101,171 in 1860), owned 
by 65,987 masters, employing only 442,310 workers (besides 34,846 clerks and 
23,251 servants). This meant that the average number of workers per shop was 
only 7.7 sinking from 13 in the building and metal trades to 1.4 in the food 
industry. By far the largest numbers were employed in the garment industry: 
306,567 (208,675 women); building, owing to Baron Haussmann's reconstruction of 
the capital, employed most men, 125,371 (63,675 women); and the various luxury 
industries, upon which the repute and prosperity of Paris mainly depended, 
employed 63,617 workers. In all, workers (468,337) and their dependents 
(286,670) made up about 40 per cent of the population of Paris" (F. Jellinek, 
<i>The Paris Commune of 1871</i> (London: Gollancz, 1937).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> The idea that revolutionary 
theory is something static, enshrined once and for all in the writings of the 
four great teachers, something to be derived from the study of books, and the 
idea that socialist consciousness has to be brought to the proletariat "from 
outside" (Lenin) by the bourgeois intelligentsia, which is "the vehicle of 
science" (Kautsky), are both profoundly reactionary and profoundly 
anti-dialectical, in the deepest sense of the term.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a> As Marx so clearly put it: 
"the inveterate habits acquired by the soldiery under the training of the 
enemies of the working class, are not of course likely to change, the very 
moment these soldiers change sides".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n10" href="#fn10">[10]</a> Who is this anonymous and 
mysterious "one"? Who is to bestow "absolute confidence" in the revolutionary 
organ and the revolutionary organizers? Is it the masses? Is it the Party 
"acting in the interests of the masses"? Is it the Party leaders "acting in the 
interests of the Party" as a whole? Is Trotsky's ambiguity on this point 
entirely accidental?</p>
