<p class="transcriber">THE BACKGROUND: In 1950 a general strike had led to the 
abdication of King Leopold. In 1958-59 workers, and in fact whole villages, had 
taken part in widespread strikes and struggles in protest at the closing of the 
nationalized Borinage coalfields. The strike of 1960-61 was the culmination of a 
growing movement of social protest that had been building up over many years. 
The economic situation of Belgium had been slowly deteriorating. The last and 
most drastic attempt to improve it, at the expense of the working class, was the 
introduction of the loi unique, which cut into workers' purchasing power and 
threatened their conditions of work. On December 14, 1960, a one-day 
demonstration was called by the Socialist Party and the trade unions to protest 
against this law. It met with tremendous success. On December 20, the day the 
debate on the law began in Parliament, the municipal workers came out on 
official, nationwide, strike. While most of the other unions were discussing 
what to do next, a spontaneous movement of unparalleled extent swept the country 
like a tidal wave. The official strike call, which came a few days later, was 
the endorsement of an accomplished fact Within a week nearly a million workers 
were out.</p>

<h3><a name="h1">Brussels, Wednesday, December 28</a></h3>

<h4><a name="h2">11.00 am.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">This is the seventh day of the struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">At the Air Terminal, the escalator is not moving. Current, says 
the Government, must be economized. Buses and trams have stopped. Refuse blows 
along pavements that have not been swept for days. The weather is clear and 
sunny, but very cold. A few people hurry about their business. There seem to be 
plenty of cars. Petrol distribution is not seriously affected. In the Air 
Terminal windows, an enormous portrait of the recently married royal couple. 
This is a bit provocative, I feel, and unlikely to endure.</p>

<p class="fst">The Central Railway Station is almost deserted. Out of curiosity, 
I walk in. Well provided with light weapons, small groups of soldiers in green 
and brown camouflage uniform stand disconsolately about. In the poorly lit 
central hall an enormous blackboard announces: "In view of the social conflict, 
no communications can be ensured in any direction". People walk up to it, stare, 
read it once, twice, three times ... and walk silently away. One ticket kiosk is 
open. "A train to Liège?" "No, Sir. We have no information, Sir. If you would 
call again in a couple of hours, Sir, we may know something more. We cannot 
guarantee that you will arrive, Sir". I wonder whether the man behind the 
counter is obsequious because he is a scab or whether it's the other way around.</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<p class="fst">At a little kiosk I buy a copy of <i>Le Peuple</i>, the official 
organ of the Belgian Socialist Party (PSB). It announces a big demonstration for 
that morning. At the Maison du Peuple, the party headquarters, I am told the 
direction the procession has moved. After an hour I catch up as it is about to 
disperse. About two or three thousand people are still thronging a broad 
crossroads. A tram has been surrounded and its front windows smashed. The crowd 
is swarming around another tram. Posters proclaim, "No, to the New Law" and "Why 
must <i>we</i> always pay?". "Eyskens, resign", chants the crowd in rhythm. 
Other groups are shouting, "Eyskens, to the gallows". There are masses of young 
people there.</p>

<p class="fst">Two hefty-looking lads, one about 25, the other older, tell me 
they are tram drivers. This is the first day of a token strike of the Brussels 
tramwaymen. All the tram workers belonging to the Brussels FCTB<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
have been called out. The Catholic trade union has instructed its members to 
remain at work. For psychological reasons, they tell me, all the scabs have been 
concentrated on the 6.00 am shift, "to give the public an impression that many 
trams are still running". "Look", they say, "they have taken out the smallest 
trams they could and the ones in the worst state of repair. They would never 
allow an old tram like that on the lines in ordinary times. They won't run them 
for long. There's a rule that if, for any reason, a tram window is broken, the 
vehicle must return to the depot". "If it can", chipped in the other, laughing.</p>

<p class="fst">The crowd starts marching down one of the main shopping streets, 
singing the <i>Internationale</i>. The police half-heartedly throw a cordon of 
about thirty men across it. They are only one deep. Good-humouredly the crowd 
turns the edges of the cordon, or even walks straight through it, and proceeds 
down the boulevard, singing, laughing and shouting. I see the banners of the 
Socialist Youth. They are very interested to learn how closely some people in 
Britain have been following their struggle. Fraternal bonds are established 
within minutes. 'This is something", one of them says, "that neither your rulers 
nor ours will ever understand".</p>

<h4><a name="h3">2.00 pm.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The Socialist Youth (Jeunes Gardes Socialistes) are very helpful. 
Mobilized since the struggle began, their working headquarters is a long, dark 
room in a little side street just behind the Maison du Peuple. It is a constant 
hive of activity. One of the comrades accompanies me to their official office in 
the party headquarters. I am given my passport to Socialist Belgium: a letter of 
introduction from the Jeunes Gardes.</p>

<p class="fst">The comrade then takes me to the national FGTB headquarters, a 
massive modern well-equipped building, just like "official" trade union 
headquarters anywhere else. The walls are hung with large portraits of the aged 
and bearded founders of the Belgian labour and trade union movement. I am 
introduced to André Renard's secretary. Renard is assistant secretary of the 
FGTB and is generally regarded as the official spokesman of its "left" wing, a 
kind of Belgian Frank Cousins, with a big following in the industrial region 
around Liège.</p>

<p class="fst">I explain my purpose to her. Our interview is constantly 
interrupted by incoming and outgoing telephone calls, themselves a time 
consuming procedure. The conversations are constantly interrupted or branched on 
to wrong numbers. The grossly restricted staff of scabs at the Central Telephone 
Exchange must be having an exhausting time. At the FGTB the delays are accepted 
with patience and a sort of amused pride. "In Brussels, everything is normal", 
the wireless has just announced. I reflect on the multiple aspects of a 
telephonists' strike in a period of mass social upheaval.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally I meet Andre Renard for a few minutes. Here is the 
"anarchist", the "revolutionary", the actual villain in the eyes of the 
screaming bourgeois press. Looking younger than his years, an immensely 
self-confident man, he is obviously aware of the tremendous strength of several 
hundred thousand miners and metal workers in the Walloon area. At least for the 
time being they seem to speak one language and he appears to be the embodiment 
of their will to struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">He assures me that I will encounter no difficulties from the 
strike pickets and trade unions in the Walloon area and wishes me good luck in 
my tour. 'Tell your readers that we will fight this to the end", he says. His 
secretary appends a few lines to my "pass" which is now an open-sesame to 
strike-bound Belgium. We leave.</p>

<p class="fst">"No applications in writing! No referral of the matter to this or 
that sub-committee!", I comment to my young friend, delighted at the informality 
and helpfulness just encountered. "They have to ... now", he answered.</p>

<h4><a name="h4">9.00 pm.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">With the picket, outside the Brussels Main Post Office and 
Sorting Station. This is an enormous modern building, some 300 yards long and 
perhaps ten storeys high. Half an hour ago the postmen's delegate had called at 
the Socialist Youth Headquarters asking for reinforcements. A dozen comrades 
quickly go there. Soon we are joined by other hastily summoned reinforcements.</p>

<p class="fst">The majority of the 2,000 postal workers attached to the office 
have been on strike for about a week. The scabs are still working, protected by 
tommy-gun carrying parachutists and gendarmes. All the sorting of incoming and 
outgoing mail for the Brussels area takes place here. Only one entrance is in 
use, for both pedestrians and vehicles. This leads under an arch and into a 
small yard and is very heavily guarded. Between 9.00 and 9.30 pm the shifts 
change. Work at the office goes on around the clock. The authorities seem well 
aware of the importance of maintaining even a skeleton staff. Fast-moving, 
heavily guarded lorries carry the scabs in and out. They are loudly booed. The 
picket, which numbers perhaps fifty people, is not allowed within eighty yards 
of the entrance to the depot and contact, verbal or physical, with the scabs is 
not possible. Such is the present relation of forces. At the moment, little can 
be done to alter it. The lads on the picket seem however just as aware as the 
authorities of the necessity to maintain a substantial picket. I am repeatedly 
told it is one of the key points of the strike in the Brussels area.</p>

<p class="fst">It is extremely cold. We walk up and down, along the pavement, 
between the arrival and departure of the scab lorries. Only a small minority of 
the picket seem to be post office workers. The rest are militants from other 
unions, the Socialist Party and the Jeunes Gardes.</p>

<p class="fst">I interview a young postal worker, who has worked for five years 
at this depot. He tells me that for the first few days there was a massive 
picket of post-office workers. "But there were too many troops. We now only send 
a token picket. We know who's working".</p>

<p class="fst">I question him about the organization of the post office workers 
at this depot (Bruxelles X - Bureau de Tri). About fifty percent apparently 
belong to the Centrale Générale des Services Publics, an affiliate of the FCTB. 
About thirty percent belong to the Catholic Confédération Syndicale Chrétienne. 
The others are either not in unions or are members of the <i>syndicate neutres</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">He tells me that in the FGTB, to which he belongs, there are no 
regular branch meetings for the workers in his department. Every so often, when 
important decisions have to be imparted on the men, the union leaders convene a 
meeting. Such meetings may be attended by up to eighty percent of the men. 'The 
leaders tell us what we have to decide. Then they take the temperature of the 
meeting. If there is massive opposition, things are modified". I ask him if 
there are ever mass meetings of all the workers employed in a given department 
or section, irrespective of their particular union affiliation. No, he says. He 
agrees it would be a good idea. "We are very divided. It weakens us". He had 
been in the Socialist Youth movement but now concerns himself exclusively with 
trade union matters. He has heard of and is interested in the British Shop 
Stewards' Movement.</p>

<p class="fst">He tells me how union delegates are elected at his place of work. 
There are yearly elections to determine the distribution of delegates, between 
the various unions "catering" for post office workers. "In a given office, the 
elections may show that FGTB will be allocated three delegates, the Christians 
two, the others one. The FGTB will then assemble its supporters separately, to 
elect its three delegates". These are not revocable during their tenure in 
office. "We don't see as much of them as we would like".</p>

<p class="fst">At this stage a platoon of about twenty gendarmes marches past us 
on the pavement. They are greeted with a resounding <i>Internationale</i>. They 
glare at us as they march by.</p>

<h4><a name="h5">10.30 pm.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">General Assembly at the Socialist Youth Headquarters. About forty 
young comrades are present, sitting on crates and chairs in various states of 
disrepair. About a third of them are girls. No one seems much over thirty. A 
single light. The corners of the room are in darkness. On one side a big stove. 
On the walls posters of the Algerian Revolution, posters relating to their own 
activities and a portrait of Lenin. Earlier that afternoon they had met and 
discussed what they would do the following day. Certain slogans had been 
collectively decided upon: "Eyskens to the gallows" -"For a strike to the 
finish" - 'The bankers must pay" - 'The soldiers are with us" - 'The factories 
to the workers". Two comrades had been delegated to contact Communist Youth to 
explore the possibilities of united action for Thursday.</p>

<p class="fst">The Communist Youth, the delegates report, had agreed to all the 
slogans except the last one. The delegation had thereupon agreed to omit the 
"offending" slogan. When they announced this to the Assembly there was an unholy 
rumpus. "Mandate exceeded", they were told again and again. An overwhelming vote 
was taken dissociating the meeting from the actions of its delegates and 
pledging support for the controversial slogan. The delegates were instructed to 
contact the Communist Youth again, informing them of the decision: "We will 
march separately, if necessary. We will carry the slogans of our choice".</p>

<p class="fst">The posters were made. Next day the slogan, 'The factories to the 
workers", was taken up again and again by the crowd. Various papers carried 
pictures of comrades carrying this poster. It was shown on the television 
newsreel. The message had been taken into tens of thousands of working class 
homes.</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<p class="fst">Today, there has been a further extension of the strike. 35,000 
metal workers in the Senne valley have downed tools. The strike has spread to 
the engineering works of Peugeot, Raguenau, Metallurgia, Rateau, Acomal and 
Standard Triumph. It also spread at Ypres, at Courtrai and at Alost. The 
furniture workers at Malines and both boot and shoe operatives and textile 
workers at Termonde have joined the strike.</p>

<p class="fst">There have been massive demonstrations at Bruges and at Ghent, 
where 10,000 demonstrators paraded in the streets. There were several violent 
scuffles with the police. At Namur a gendarme told the strikers: "You can have 
another Grace-Berleur, if you want one!"<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">At Herstal, an industrial suburb of Liège, 5,000 strikers 
assembled to hear Lambion, the secretary of the local metal workers federation. 
At Liège 2,000 railway workers walked through the streets and then paraded in 
front of the railway station singing the <i>Internationale</i>, 15,000 workers 
assembled in the industrial town of Huy, 8,000 at Waremme.</p>

<p class="fst">At Charleroi, a recently arrived comrade tells us, the strikers 
had formed enormous queues outside the Post Office, where a few scabs are still 
working, under heavy police protection. Any genuine customers arriving had been 
sent to the end of the queue, where they soon lost patience. One by one, the 
strikers had entered the Post Office to buy ten centime (halfpenny) stamps, each 
holding out a bank note and telling the scab to hurry up and give them change. 
"That's what you're there for, isn't it?", they had asked.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h6">Brussels, Thursday, December 29.</a></h3>

<h4><a name="h7">10.00 am.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">By 10.00 am, an enormous crowd has already assembled in front of 
the Maison du Peuple, the headquarters of the Socialist Party, of the 
Cooperatives and of the Mutual Aid Societies. Together with the FGTB unions 
these three organizations constitute the Action Commune which is "running" the 
strike.</p>

<p class="fst">Here are the working people of Brussels in their thousands: metal 
workers and engineers from the "red" suburb of Forest, railway workers, 
Government and municipal employees, shop girls and white collar workers from ail 
over the city, old and young, seasoned veterans and people participating in this 
sort of thing for the first time, all of them in their opposition to the latest 
Government proposals, all of them determined to say, "No! It will not always be 
at <i>our</i> expense that they solve <i>their</i> problems". It is an 
impressive sight. The crowd swarms over the pavements, overflows into the 
neighbouring streets. Vendors selling <i>Le Peuple</i> (journal of the Socialist 
Party), <i>La Wallonie</i> (journal of the socialist trade unions of the Liège 
area), <i>Le Drapeau Rouge</i> (journal of the Communist Party) and <i>La Gauche</i> 
(journal of the Socialist Party "left") are all doing a roaring trade. The crowd 
is in good humour. People buy all the papers they can lay their hands on, 
discuss them, avid for news, happy at the sight of their own multitude.</p>

<p class="fst">Loudspeakers are fitted on the window-sills of the Maison du 
Peuple, Trade Union and Party leaders address the crowd, assure it that <i>they</i> 
will fight to a finish, that <i>they</i> will not compromise, that the 
iniquitous law cannot be amended, that it must be rejected wholesale, that 
Government propaganda is spreading, that victory is assured and that the 
Government cannot but be impressed at the numerical strength and self-discipline 
of the thousands of demonstrators. The crowd listens happily in the pale winter 
sunshine. Contingents from some of the big cities (Ghent, Antwerp, Liège) march 
up the street, singing the <i>Internationale</i>, and are loudly applauded. 
Finally the procession sets off, socialist parliamentarians and provincial 
delegations in the lead, a broad river of red flags and posters denouncing the 
law in Flemish, overflowing its banks, lapping up small streams of demonstrators 
joining it at various points.</p>

<p class="fst">Slowly the procession proceeds to the fringes of the so-called 
neutral zone, where Parliament is situated and within which demonstrators are 
not permitted. The zone is guarded by barbed wire and crammed with mounted 
police, troops in jeeps, detachments of gendarmerie, water-lorries with pressure 
hose equipment, etc. A very small delegation of the Action Commune is allowed to 
enter the zone and is received by the Prime Minister. The main procession 
continues through the main streets, growing in volume from minute to minute.</p>

<p class="fst">It passes in front of a number of big banks and finance houses. 
The slogan, 'The bankers must pay", is taken up by thousands of demonstrators 
and must be heard in the most remote offices or crypts. The windows of several 
banks are bombarded with stones and large bolts, with which many demonstrators 
seem extraordinarily well supplied. The police lining the pavement look on, 
quite helpless. On one occasion two policemen advance towards a demonstrator 
carrying a large brick. An angry growl from the crowd sends them scurrying back, 
as fast as their legs can take them. Some of the missiles thrown do not reach 
their targets, but hit the masonry between the windows and fall back on to the 
pavement. So confident is the crowd in its numbers that demonstrators come and 
pick up their projectiles at the feet of the policemen, pocketing them for later 
use. The relation of forces is rather different than last night, outside the 
Post Office.</p>

<p class="fst">The official socialist press commented as follows: "After ten 
days of an extremely hard strike, Thursday's demonstrators had no particular bad 
feelings towards the shopkeepers in the city centre. If the windows were broken 
of a few enterprises representing big business, it's because the demonstrators 
were fully aware whence was coming the aggression threatening their social 
conquests". Which, from the mouthpiece of social democracy, is quite an 
admission!</p>

<p class="fst">The procession proceeds joyfully through a number of lesser 
streets to emerge into an enormous boulevard, the Botanique, where it turns 
sharply to descend into the centre of the city. The sight is unforgettable. 
Marching twenty or thirty abreast, occupying the whole width of the boulevard, 
the procession extends as far back as the eye can see. The <i>Internationale</i> 
rends the air again and again. Many young people are now in the very front rows. 
They sing as if they mean every word of it Here is the answer, I cannot help 
thinking, to those who assert that youth is non-political, that the proletariat 
no longer exists, that it has suffered disintegration through capitalist 
prosperity or assimilation into the structure of capitalist society. The slogan, 
'The factories to the workers", is taken up again and again encountering each 
time a growing echo. The most popular slogan however is undoubtedly "Eyskens, to 
the gallows"!</p>

<p class="fst">After a further hour of marching through the shopping area, 
bedecked with forlorn looking Christmas decorations, the procession reaches the 
Place Fontainas, where a mass rally was to have taken place. The speakers are 
already waiting, all smiles, with their microphones and their flags, on an 
elevated dais. The continuation of the street is barred by a double row of 
stewards: this is intended to be the dispersal point.</p>

<p class="fst">The head of the procession has now been taken over by the 
Socialist Youth and a number of young militants from Liège and Antwerp. They 
have been discussing for the last two hours. More marches? More speeches? What 
next? How can <i>we</i> intervene? What does the crowd really want? Is it one 
crowd or several crowds? Half a mile further on, beyond the barrage of stewards, 
lies the main Post Office with its two or three hundred massively protected 
scabs.</p>

<p class="fst">A new slogan bursts forth: "<i>A l'action! A l'action!</i>" 
Enough speeches! The procession ignores the call to stop coming from the 
loudspeakers but marches right up to the stewards, cutting through them as if 
they did not exist. Three hundred, four hundred, now five hundred people have 
broken the barrier. The stewards, helped by the trade union officials and 
parliamentarians, succeed in re-establishing it. Twenty or thirty comrades from 
the cut off section at the head of the procession are promptly dispatched behind 
the cordon. Again the slogans ring out and again the crowd swarm through the 
barrier. The flood can no longer be contained. Thousands of people turn their 
backs on the Place Fontainas and surge towards the Post Office.</p>

<p class="fst">The following day the socialist press was to describe the 
incident as follows: "The demonstrators, having reached the Place Fontainas, did 
not stop as had been anticipated but carried on towards the Midi, which was 
guarded by powerful gendarmerie detachments". In fact such was the pressure from 
the rank and file that the paper even had to endorse what happened: 'This was 
not the result of activities of excited agitators. The flood tide, which 
although it may at times take on violent forms, is always inspired by legitimate 
motives".</p>

<p class="fst">The procession raggedly advances on the Post Office. A "black" 
tram is spotted in a side street by some demonstrators who immediately give 
chase to it, disrupting the procession still further. The conductor accelerates, 
fleeing for his life and, disregarding all safety regulations, hurtles along the 
rails, nearly running over several people in the process. He just escapes.</p>

<p class="fst">The comrades in front then stop. The ranks reform. A crowd can 
show immense self-discipline when striving for objectives of its own choice. The 
stragglers and those who had given chase to the tram are reabsorbed. The compact 
procession moves on. The police have obviously been taken as much by surprise as 
have the organizers of the demonstration. Only some thirty mounted gendarmes and 
a few dozen on foot line the front of the building. Boos greet the gendarmes. 
The horses rear and throw off two of their riders as the crowd shower bolts and 
thunder-flashes into the ranks of the police. The crowd cheers ironically. The 
gendarmes do not attempt to disrupt the procession at this stage and are left 
alone by the crowd. At the Post Office every window is broken at street level 
and many on the first floor. The stones rain into the building for at least ten 
minutes. Under the impotent gaze of about fifty extremely frightened policemen, 
demonstrators seize bins, full to the brim with the uncleared refuse of a week, 
and discharge their content through the broken windows into the offices and onto 
the desks of the scabs.</p>

<p class="fst">Some of the demonstrators then disperse, but other contingents 
march through side streets, rejoining the tail of the procession and thus coming 
in front of the Post Office a second time.</p>

<p class="fst">A postal bus, of the kind used to escort scabs into the depot, is 
turned over. Finally, hastily summoned reinforcements of mounted and foot police 
appear and succeed in clearing the street. It requires drawn swords and the 
threatening display of loaded guns to achieve this end. The crowd straggles back 
to the Place Fontainas where they are addressed by Gedhof, the trade union 
delegate from Sabena airline.</p>

<p class="fst">The speaker tells the demonstrators that sixty-five percent of 
the Sabena personnel are on strike but that Mr. Dieu, the manager, has just 
issued an instruction to the staff announcing the strictest measures against the 
strikers. "Mr. Dieu still thinks himself in the Congo", the speaker said. "For 
years he has been ordering coloured people about there; now he thinks he can do 
the same with us".</p>

<p class="fst">The speaker announced a demonstration, for the following day, to 
go to Sabena headquarters. This was the demonstration in which the first fatal 
casualty of the strike was to occur.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h8">Liège, Thursday December 29.</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Arrived here about 5.00 pm. The strike is far more widespread 
than in Brussels. All public transport has been at a standstill for several 
days. Many of the big stores are closed. Others are obeying the "request" of the 
FGTB and are opening only 10.00 am to 1.00 pm. Croups of about a dozen policemen 
scurry about the streets. Croups of strikers congregate in tight little knots 
arguing. Many people have gathered outside the offices of the local FGTB paper, <i>
La Wallonie</i>. Some read the latest issue pasted on the boards. Others examine 
the front window of the premises, damaged a few nights ago when right-wing 
hooligans smashed the panes with a bottle.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>La Wallonie</i> has played an important role in the strike. It 
has been the mouthpiece of the most militant section of the trade union 
apparatus. It has given publicity and support to the strike, describing in 
considerable detail and with many pictures the main meetings of strikers, and 
has reported in full all the statements of the Socialist Party and FGTB leaders. 
It has attempted, from above, to co-ordinate the struggle, announcing meetings 
and places where socialist papers may be collected. It has repeatedly denounced 
and exposed the falsifications of the bourgeois press.</p>

<p class="fst">On December 24 the paper printed a special call to the troops: to 
fraternize with the strikers, to refuse to be used as blacklegs, and not be 
traitors to their class. This appeal, one of the most dramatic documents to have 
emerged from the great struggle of the Belgian working class, truly enraged the 
Government. That same evening, on orders from Brussels, officers of the judicial 
police accompanied by the judge and a royal attorney (<i>procureur du roi</i>) 
were busy in the most undignified task of tearing down posters, forcing the 
locks of display panel boxes, etc. An order had gone out for the paper to be 
"seized". The officers then erupted into the paper's offices and took all the 
issues they could find. In the early hours of Christmas Day visits and searches 
of homes were ordered. Accompanied by gendarmes, parties set out to raid the 
homes of trade union officials and militants; others descended on trade union 
premises and bookshops seizing copies of the December 24 issue.</p>

<p class="fst">In its next issue the paper spoke up quite boldly: "<i>La 
Wallonie</i> has no intention of keeping quiet. It will continue, as before, to 
fight for the good cause. It will not be dissuaded from doing its duty, even if 
threatened by seizure".</p>

<p class="fst">The seizure had interesting repercussions. The "forbidden" 
article was taken up by two other socialist papers, <i>Le Monde du Travail</i> 
and <i>Le Peuple</i>, which published it in full - and were thereupon promptly 
"seized" in their turn! Teams of young socialists and trade unionists then 
plastered the walls and hoardings of the city with leaflets reproducing the 
appeal. Some of these had been scraped off by officialdom but many remained.</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<p class="fst">I am beginning to learn my way about. I ask for "<i>La Populate</i>" 
(the colloquial term for the Maison du Peuple). At this stage of the struggle I 
sense it will be a focal point. The ground floor is an enormous restaurant, run 
on co-operative lines, where free coffees are served to strikers at all times of 
the day or night. Groups of comrades from the unions and the Socialist Party are 
in permanent session in the various offices upstairs. An enormous red flag hangs 
from the first floor windows.</p>

<p class="fst">I tell them my business. Several comrades kindly agree to take me 
to various places. While waiting I talk to several people at the tables 
downstairs. First a refuse collector, a strapping great man with a keen sense of 
humour. "We stopped work on the very first day. In a sense we started all this. 
But they couldn't take it. Dirt frightens them. We were requisitioned on the 
fourth day. An armed gendarme on a motorbike called at each of our homes with a 
summons. We had to report next day at our usual depot. And I'd told the missus 
not to open the door! The cop barged in and just dumped the paper on the table. 
If he doesn't come we'll lock him up, he said. They passed a law in 1789 
entitling them to do this. We discussed it amongst ourselves. We don't want to 
be in clink on great days like this. Sort of an unsanitary place, we felt. We 
couldn't be much help behind bars. So we went to work next day ... wearing 
these!" He showed me the posters they had slipped over their dungarees. One said 
"Requisitioned by force", the other "Solidarity with the strikers", "No to the <i>
loi unique</i>". The photos were published next day in all the socialist press.</p>

<p class="fst">I next spoke to a professional man employed by the municipality. 
'This is the most vicious onslaught on rights and conditions which it has taken 
us years of struggle to acquire. This law is the last straw. Why should ordinary 
people always have to foot the bill? They will agree no longer. In a country 
like Belgium no government can rule without the consent of the working class. We 
will win!" His quiet assurance, I thought, promised untold difficulties for 
anyone trying to sell out the struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">A young metal worker from the industrial suburb of Seraing tells 
me of interesting developments in his area. Old people are short of coal. It is 
a bitterly cold winter. The coal merchants have no stocks. The union now looks 
after all cases of hardship. The coal merchant comes to the union. They issue 
him with a permit, allowing him to collect a given quantity of coal from 
authorized persons. Without this certificate no deliveries can take place. "A 
good idea for after the strike", he muses, "we have accounts to settle!"</p>

<p class="fst">A railway worker tells me of the events that morning outside the 
Gare des Guillemins, the main Liège railway station. In the very early hours a 
scab postal van had arrived, bringing in large bundles of rightwing papers from 
Brussels. The van had intended to discharge its contents into a strike-bound 
militarily guarded postal depot at the station. It had been spotted by the 
railwaymen's picket, before it could reach the depot. Its contents had made an 
enormous bonfire at which the pickets had been able to warm themselves.</p>

<h4><a name="h9">6.30 pm.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">A comrade collects me and we proceed to the <i>Wallonie</i> 
premises. The streets are poorly lit. Current is scarce and supplies may fail, 
we are told, at any moment. A few young comrades are guarding the side entrance 
to the building, the only one in use. They each hold an iron bar. They 
anticipate further trouble. Some people, I am told, have been whipped into a 
white rage against the strikers and their press, by the incitements of the 
bourgeois papers, <i>Le Matin</i> (of Antwerp) and <i>Flandre Liberate</i> had 
called on the Government to become even tougher in relation to "the riot". <i>Le 
Libre Belgique</i> had screamed, "Down with Collard, Major and Leburton" 
(moderate socialist and trade union leaders). The wireless must no longer be put 
at the disposal of the revolutionaries. Daily these papers were exhorting their 
readers to be ruthless with the strikers, who were presented as the scum of the 
earth.</p>

<p class="fst">The young guards were taking no chances. My escort was 
fortunately known to them. Upstairs one of the editors gave me some photos and a 
file of back numbers of the paper. With a chuckle he went to a cupboard and 
produced a copy of the "seized" issue! "Look after this one", he said, "it could 
become a historical number". 'Tell your friends what you have seen. This is a 
magnificent movement. Every working man and woman in this area is involved in 
this struggle. I am now well over fifty. I never thought I would see anything 
like it. Working people in Britain must be told the true facts". I promised to 
do my best. We went downstairs again. We found it considerably easier to leave 
the building than to enter it!</p>

<h4><a name="h10">8.00 pm.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">In the car of one of the comrades of the Liège Socialist Party, 
we visit a number of the Maisons du Peuple around Liège. These are very similar 
to the Working Men's Clubs in Britain. Almost overnight they became local strike 
headquarters. Here the strikers check in each day, or alternate days, according 
to region or occupation. Here the strike benefits are paid. Although they vary 
from area to area the average is around £2 per week. Solidarity funds are 
pouring in on an increasing scale from all over the country and free food is 
distributed here to families in need. The clubs are also distribution centres 
for the working class papers. Picket rotas are planned and other important local 
decisions are taken in these halls. Before the strike the clubs had mainly a 
recreational function. Many ran football teams or had teams of pigeon fanciers. 
Some showed "socialisf films regularly. In the Maison du Peuple of Saint-Gilles, 
which we are now visiting, the film <i>Salt of the Earth</i> had just been 
shown. This had inspired the idea of the women's picket, walking silently round 
and round in front of the Liège Post office from 7.00 to 9.00 am every morning.</p>

<p class="fst">A great welcome meets us at all these places. Everyone is anxious 
that the British working class get to know the facts. 'The papers will all tell 
lies about us", I am told again and again. Naturally I agree. The Belgian 
wireless and television are violently opposed to the strike. I am just in time 
to see a TV version of the events I had personally witnessed in Brussels that 
very morning. Slick editing ensured that the rowdiest episodes were shown in a 
very fragmentary manner. No pictures appeared showing the enormous size of the 
demonstration and discreet cutting had ensured that the brutality of the 
gendarmerie did not appear on the screen. I have a short discussion with a local 
trade union militant, a lorry driver. 'The movement must develop. We have done 
well so far. But we cannot stop. <i>Il faut aller jusqu' au bout</i>".<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst"><i>A</i> local Socialist Party official tells me the Party will 
fight to the end. Another comrade informs me that even Senator Dehousse is on 
their side. He is a local boy who has made good in a big way. He is apparently 
well known in the United Europe movement. His speeches at Strasbourg are very 
polished ones. I point out that Europe is not united now. Half of it is backing 
Eyskens. The other half is on the side of men like themselves. They all agree.</p>

<p class="fst">A little way from there, at the bottom of the Rue St. Laurent, we 
pass over a bridge, spanning the Brussels-Liège railway line. A lone soldier is 
sitting on the stone parapet, a tommy gun on one side and a thermos flask on the 
other. He is talking to a group of three railwaymen, who have just brought him 
hot soup. When the men have left I walk up to him. I tell him who I am. He seems 
quite friendly. He is about 28, fair-haired, Flemish. He told me that he spoke 
to the local people every night. He was called back from Germany three days ago. 
No, he is not a conscript. He has done his time, but re-enlisted. His father is 
a bricklayer, now working at Namur. What he thinks of the strike? 'They must see 
no other way!" Has he heard of the appeal, in the seized issue of <i>La Wallonie</i>? 
Of course! Well? He looks me straight in the eyes: "<i>Je ne tirerai jamais sur 
pareil à moi!</i>"<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> All, after 
this, is anti-climax. Yes, they discuss the strike in his mess. Some are for, 
some against. The officers? As you'd expect! I've orders to speak to no one, he 
suddenly says, abruptly changing his tone, as a military lorry appears at the 
other end of the bridge.</p>

<p class="fst">Leo Collard, leader of the Socialist Party, told a Press 
Conference today that "the strike will last as long as necessary, even if trade 
union resources dry up. Common Action will itself start strike payments on 
Saturday. This will be a first instalment, the extent of which will vary ... 
according to the man's occupation and to the number of days he has been on 
strike. The <i>loi unique</i> cannot be the basis of a solution. The government 
has conceived of this law as an organic whole ... we cannot see how a compromise 
could be reached by amending its details. We are struggling, quite simply, for 
its withdrawal".<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Bold words. But verbal assaults hardly topple governments.</p>

<p class="fst">Also today: a gigantic rally of 50,000 workers in Antwerp. The 
procession, headed by hundreds of red flags, had crossed the town and paraded 
through the working class districts followed by all available local police. All 
shops had shut. One of the main slogans had been "Catholic workers, join us". A 
convoy of gendarmes hastily dispatched from Brussels had then arrived and had 
attacked the tail of the procession with tear gas grenades as it was beginning 
to disperse.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h11">Liège, Friday, December 30.</a></h3>

<h4><a name="h12">6.00 am.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">With the picket, outside the Vuillemins station. The postal sheds 
are the key points. At least eighty lads are picketing. They are cheerful: 
yesterday morning's events warmed both hearts and hands!</p>

<p class="fst">Nothing very much happens. No postal van is likely to run the 
gauntlet again. And it's very early for Messieurs the Gendarmes to be put.</p>

<p class="fst">The picket is again of very mixed composition: postmen, 
railwaymen, engineers, even a miner. I speak to him. He works in a small pit, at 
Milmort, employing 450 men at the face and 150 on top. They joined the strike on 
Wednesday, December 21 - as soon as they heard that the municipal employees in 
Liège had walked out.'"Nothing could stop us. Agitation against the Law had been 
building up for weeks. The men were all prepared for action. The union leaders 
were dithering about when, and how, and for how long ... It was like a tidal 
wave. Within hours the whole coalfield was out. The official decision came 24 
hours later!"</p>

<p class="fst">Other pickets gave the same story: immediate and massive 
solidarity action of the rank and file, then hasty "official" decisions, 
ratifying the established fact. Nevertheless once the official machinery got 
moving it gave a further impetus to the struggle. The Liège-Huy-Waremme Regional 
Congress of the FGTB, meeting on December 22, called for "total and immediate 
cessation of work in all sectors, in production and distribution and in both 
private and public enterprises". It pledged that the local FGTB organizations 
would remain united "until final victory was assured".</p>

<h4><a name="h13">8.00 am.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Over a hundred women are picketing outside the Liège main Post 
Office. They walk in silent procession up and down the pavement in front of a 
small main entrance through which the scabs must pass. Twenty yards away stand 
the menfolk, ominously watching lest they be molested. Three large policemen and 
two armed soldiers stand in front of the door. They look extremely stupid and 
quite embarrassed as the girls circle round them, as if they did not exist. The 
picket seems effective. Few scabs confront the cold irony of these determined 
women.</p>

<p class="fst">On the first day, about thirty of the sixty women pickets had 
been arrested and roughly thrown into two black Marias. There was an unholy 
rumpus because one of them was the deputy Fontaine-Borguet. They were all 
promptly released ... and proceeded straight back to the picket line. Next day, 
over a hundred women were picketing. Today, about 130. My thoughts went to other 
pickets. There women had been arrested, none of whom had enjoyed the benefits of 
parliamentary immunity!</p>

<h4><a name="h14">10.30 am.</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><i>A</i> mass meeting is being held in the big hall of the Maison 
du Peuple, which is packed with about 1,200 local government personnel, postmen, 
clerks from the births and deaths registry, tramwaymen, road sweepers, girls 
from the public library, the manual and white-collar staff of innumerable 
departments of local government, both large and small. The speakers on the 
platform look self-important and self-satisfied. The meeting starts half-an-hour 
late. The crowd waits patiently. The audience are flattered about their "heroic 
struggle, their unity, their discipline", but no plan is developed. They listen 
in silence. Three passages evoke applause: reference to a possible march on 
Brussels, a statement that "although calm and dignified today each one of us is 
prepared for more active forms of struggle tomorrow", and a peroration "that 
Belgium had been misruled for long enough and that it was high time the working 
class took Belgium's fate into its own hands".</p>

<p class="fst">At the end of the lengthy meeting, many of the audience drift 
down to the "gents" in the basement. Money-boxes adorn the walls with the 
inscription: "Now remember that strike fund!"</p>

<h4><a name="h15">12.30 pm.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">After the meeting, several hundred of the audience drift to the 
Place St. Paul, a secluded square in front of the FGTB headquarters. Here they 
are joined by about a thousand strikers who had previously been aimlessly 
strolling through the town. A crowd of about 2,000 is soon waiting for something 
to happen. But nothing happens. In the trade union headquarters, the discussion 
is doubtless proceeding along its orderly course. The situation calls for some 
kind of lead, the absence of which is painfully obtrusive. Suddenly a group of 
quite young workers start chanting rhythmically: "<i>A l'action!</i>" The slogan 
spread. In minutes the whole square is resounding to its echo. Startled heads 
pop out of windows of the trade union building. Some thirty youngsters rush the 
front door shouting: "We'll shake them up". Part of the audience cheers. Others 
laugh. Others loudly disapprove. A minor official, standing on the steps, 
improvises a discourse on ... discipline. A leading official appears and 
skillfully endorses the crowd's desire for action. "It must be united action 
though ... Let us march to the railway station". The crowd agree 
enthusiastically. Their idea of a march on to the station obviously differs from 
that of their leaders. They set off shouting: "<i>A l'action</i>" and "The 
parachutists to the factory bench". One can feel the temperature rising. The 
procession advances for about a mile. It is then overtaken by an official trade 
union van, complete with loudspeaker equipment. The van draws up. The procession 
stops. Posters and banners are handed down to the demonstrators. "No, to the 
Law", "Eyskens, resign", 'The Walloon country has had enough", the banners of a 
week ago. The lads in the front ranks sheepishly take them. The "leaders" launch 
their slogans into the loudspeaker. The crowd takes them up half-heartedly. They 
cannot really compete. The procession reaches the large open space in front of 
the station, circles round it twice - well away from the gendarmes lining the 
pavement - and proceeds, in confused and perplexed silence, to disappear into a 
small street, leading <i>away</i> from the station.</p>

<h4><a name="h16">3.00 pm.</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><i>A</i> young comrade has agreed to drive me to Seraing, the big 
industrial suburb of Liège. This is Renard's home ground, the much publicized 
"heart of the strike". Here live thousands of steel workers and engineers who 
work at the giant Cockerill-Ougree industrial complex. We drive past miles of 
plant - enormous sheds, deserted furnaces, pressing rooms and smelting ovens. I 
was later to learn that many factories in this area had in fact been closed down 
by employers, as soon as they had seen how widespread the strike was going to 
be.</p>

<p class="fst">Too bad for the odd scab who might have wished to work. Too bad 
for their sacred "right to labour". But much safer, no doubt, from the 
employers' point of view. There is danger to valuable equipment when a town is 
full of strikers and the plants all have pickets at their gates. This is a sort 
of strike-cum-lockout, by mutual consent.</p>

<p class="fst">A thin plume of smoke still emerges from some chimneys. By mutual 
consent, too, the maintenance men had been kept at work.</p>

<p class="fst">The threat to withdraw the maintenance staff is Renard's trump 
card, the high point of his industrial strategy. The weapon however is a 
double-edged one. Several</p>

<p class="fst">workers viewed its use with misgiving. "We may win the strike and 
inherit a desert". Cockerill-Ougree employ over 25,000 men. If the furnaces went 
out thousands would be out of work for months.</p>

<p class="fst">The strike in Seraing is total. Only food shops are open - and 
this only at times allowed by the unions. Everything is extraordinarily quiet. 
Not a policeman, not a picket in sight. No women or children in the streets. 
Here and there groups of men stand at the crossroads, doing nothing.</p>

<p class="fst">We reach the Maison du Peuple which at least shows some signs of 
activity. My friend and I are brought into a tiny office where we meet three 
members of the Strike Committee, all three union officials. Elected committees 
are exceptional.</p>

<p class="fst">They look at us cagily. "Yes, the strike is quite solid. Hadn't I 
read the papers?" "Everything is quite orderly in Seraing. What did I expect?" 
Would the present methods of struggle be sufficient to make the Government 
capitulate? "Well, we'd have to see about that. To each day its tasks, however!" 
A march on Brussels? "Well, that would have to be a national decision. They were 
just holding the fort at Seraing!"</p>

<p class="fst">A significant paradox? The strike at its most complete and the 
streets as quiet as early on a Sunday morning. On the home ground of the FCTB 
"left", the apparatus is in full and undisputed control. I have an uneasy 
impression that the wheels seem to be turning in the air.</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<h4><a name="h17">5.00 pm.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">We return from Seraing along another route, close to the river, 
and enter Liège through the densely populated suburbs of Outre-Meuse. As we turn 
sharply on to the <i>quai</i> along the river Ourthe, an unforgettable sight 
suddenly meets our gaze. Three hundred yards on, a bridge spans the river. A 
procession is crossing the bridge, three enormous red flags at its head. Half 
the bridge is empty, half is black with people. The strains of the <i>
Internationale</i> can be heard in the distance.</p>

<p class="fst">We quickly join up with the procession. It was unlike any other I 
had seen, being composed almost solely of young people. It had formed 
spontaneously as soon as the news had reached Liège, of the death that morning 
in a Brussels demonstration, of a young painter. It was entirely "unofficial". A 
single, hastily made poster was carried at its head: "Eyskens, assassin. In 
Brussels today: one dead, ten wounded". Within twenty minutes the procession had 
doubled its size. Through the narrow streets of the working class quarters it 
wound its angry way. A single slogan fiercely chanted by twelve or fifteen 
hundred youngsters: "Eyskens, assassin! Eyskens, assassin!" A single song, sung 
with more passion than I have ever heard: the <i>Internationale</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The procession reaches the square where stands the statue of 
Tchantches, the famous puppet of Walloon folklore. It stops. A youngster gets on 
to the base of the statue, and speaks his mind. 'This is their real face ... 
This is what faces us. What can we do? How can we make our will effective? In 
the Party and Union headquarters, they talk. The Government waits. Time is not 
on our side. I have marched so much I have holes in my shoes. We should do 
something more". Others follow him. The idea of a march on Brussels is greeted 
with applause. But who will organize it? The Party and the Unions? But they 
don't want such a march. Or they only use one as a safety valve. "What can we 
do, here? We can disseminate the idea of the March. We must ourselves contact 
other young people, in other towns. No one will do it for us".</p>

<p class="fst">Others speak in the same vein. "The Government's hands are red 
with blood. The hands of our leaders are crippled with arthritis".</p>

<p class="fst">The procession returns to town, lodges a protest at the town 
hall, "the only practical thing we can do just now, comrades", and disperses. 
Heavy rain begins to fall.</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<p class="fst">Today there have been mass meetings at Mons and Charleroi. At 
Mons a meeting announced the previous evening was attended by 10,000 workers. 
Many had had to walk for hours to get to the town, most roads having been either 
unpaved by the strikers or blocked by tree trunks. A socialist leader, Marcel 
Busieau, stated, "it is alleged we might be ready to negotiate with the 
Government on the basis of a withdrawal of parts of the <i>loi unique</i>. This 
is false. We will fight to the end for its complete withdrawal". The <i>Monde du 
Travail</i> described this speech as "wildly applauded". So much for the record. 
The strikers then "visited" a bank where scabs were still at work. There was no 
scuffle. The manager agreed to close down immediately.</p>

<p class="fst">At Charleroi, a gigantic rally of 45,000 strikers shouts, 'To 
Brussels, to Brussels". The speaker Josse van Eynde asks them, "only heed the 
official slogans of the Action Commune".<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> 
A resolution, in which readers will detect interesting undertones, is read over 
the microphone and "approved by acclamation":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Today, Friday, December 30, 45,000 workers who, for the past 
ten days have of their own free will left their factories, building sites, 
mines, schools and offices ... proclaim:</p>

<p class="quoteb">a) their firm opposition to the <i>loi unique;</i></p>

<p class="quoteb">b) their demand that it simply be withdrawn;</p>

<p class="quoteb">c) that they have absolute confidence in their trade union 
organizations and in the Action Commune;</p>

<p class="quoteb">e) that they mandate their leaders to express their wishes and 
defend their interests;</p>

<p class="quoteb">d) that they reject with contempt the campaign of lies, 
intimidation and diversion launched by the Government, 'its' radio, 'its' Press, 
'its' television and 'its' valets of the Confédération Syndicate Chrétienne."</p>

<p class="fst">To all this we oppose the following slogan: 'The Strike 
Continues". Why did the "leaders" need reassuring?</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h18">Liège, Saturday, December 31.</a></h3>

<h4><a name="h19">10.00 am.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Theo Dejace, Communist Party deputy for Liège, is addressing an 
open air meeting in the Place de la République Francaise. Leaflets were 
distributed the previous day. About 600 people listen. The speaker calls for 
daily public meetings of the organizations leading the strike, whence clear 
directives could be issued and where comments from the rank and file might be 
heard. There is too little contact he says, between the official organizations 
and the strikers. This he believes is regrettable. He warns the crowd against 
rowdies, drunkards, and "leftists". The main task apparently is to prevent the 
new law from being voted on January 3. Between now and then assemblies of 
strikers should daily send deputations to the homes of all Social-Christian 
deputies "to impress upon them that they should comply with the wishes of their 
electors rather than obey the orders issued by the Banks and Government". An 
official Communist Party leaflet (<i>Two Communist Proposals for a Total and 
Rapid Victory</i>) is distributed at the meeting. It ends as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"If despite the popular will, the reactionary majority in 
Parliament were to continue its support for the <i>loi unique</i>, the struggle 
would continue. Let the Government have no doubt on this matter!</p>

<p class="quoteb">A Parliament which opposed itself in so flagrant a manner to 
public opinion would have to be dissolved without delay!</p>

<p class="quoteb">The strike is powerful. Let there be no irresponsible acts, 
that might weaken it!"</p>

<p class="fst">The crowd listens without great enthusiasm. The labels are 
different. The medicine tastes the same.</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<p class="fst">The Communist Party has played no important role in the present 
upsurge of the Belgian working class. Its rank-and-file members have doubtless 
fought shoulder to shoulder with Socialist Party militants and with thousands of 
struggling workers who do not belong to either organization, but its leadership 
and in particular its press have played, to say the least, a ludicrous role.</p>

<p class="fst">On December 20 the Communist Party had issued a call for a 
24-hour general strike (having previously demanded only a national demonstration 
on that day). The self-appointed "leadership" proved quite out of touch with the 
militancy of the rank and file. The movement has now lasted four weeks!</p>

<p class="fst">On December 27 the Communist Party deputy Gaston Moulin addressed 
a letter to Mr. Kronacker, President of the Chamber of Deputies, in which "he 
sought permission to question the Prime Minister of the Interior ... on the 
utilization of the Army and on the recall of reservists ... on the arbitrary 
arrests of strikers and militant workers, on the arbitrary 'seizures' of 
leaflets and papers and on the dissemination of false news through official 
channels".</p>

<p class="fst">Does it really take a general strike to make the Communists aware 
of the class nature of the Capitalist State, and to drive them to "protest" 
about it ... in Parliament?</p>

<p class="fst">On December 28, the <i>Drapeau Rouge</i> splashed on its front 
page that the Liège demonstrations demanded of the Liberal and Social-Christian 
deputies that they "obey the will of their electors". The paper hoped that in 
the next few days closer contacts would be established between the population 
and the (right-wing) deputies, "who had become isolated from their electors".</p>

<p class="fst">The paper reported that the Liège Federation of the Communist 
Party considered that "the Liège deputies Harmal, Herbiet, Olislaeger, Deslenay 
and Jeunehomme must answer the call addressed to them by the demonstrators and 
must finally understand that their stubbornness is an obstacle to the rapid and 
democratic solution to the conflict".</p>

<p class="fst">On December 29 the <i>Drapeau Rouge</i> was even more explicit: 
it titled in big letters "An Essential Objective of the Strikers: To Recall to 
the Liberal and Christian Deputies that they are in Parliament to Accomplish the 
Popular Will!" Well, well! And we, around the <i>Agitator</i>, who always 
thought they were in Parliament to defend the class interests of the bourgeoisie 
...</p>

<p class="fst">And what does the Belgian Communist Party see as the outcome of 
the strike? This is made quite explicit in a draft law submitted to Parliament 
by Communist Party deputies Gaston Moulin and Theo Dejace. This demanded:</p>

<p class="indentb">"a) the control of the banks, of the insurance companies and 
of big business [no specification as to who does the "controlling"];</p>

<p class="indentb">b) the creation of a Committee for National Investment; and</p>

<p class="indentb">c) the creation of a National Investment Fund to allow the 
rapid and harmonious development of the economy, to ensure full employment and 
to permit a rapid rise in the material and cultural level of the people."</p>

<p class="fst">Somehow I doubt the Borinage miners are struggling as they are 
for ends of this kind.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h20">Liège, Saturday, December 31.</a></h3>

<h4><a name="h21">10.00 am.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">A procession to mourn the death of the Brussels painter has been 
hastily arranged by the Action Commune. Instructions go out that the procession 
is to be a silent one. No posters. No slogans. Only red flags draped with black 
will be allowed. "This is a heaven-sent opportunity for them", a young bank 
clerk tells me. "It will enable them to contain the movement a little longer. 
Without this excuse for a silent march there would have been real violence 
today".</p>

<p class="fst">December 31 is usually a bumper day for the big stores. They were 
to have been allowed (in agreement with the FGTB) to remain open from 10.00 am 
to 6.00 pm. But when the news reached Liège yesterday that a man had been killed 
in Brussels, the Liège FGTB immediately issued a request: all shops were to 
remain closed the following day as a sign of mourning.</p>

<p class="fst">Today all the big stores are shut. Some have big posters in their 
windows: "In agreement with the FGTB and as a sign of mourning, we will not open 
on Saturday, December 31". The solicitude of the multiple store millionaires for 
a humble Brussels painter is truly touching. And the size and temper of the 
crowd in the streets is impressive.</p>

<p class="fst">The procession sets off in silence - about 6,000 strong. For the 
first half-hour no slogans are shouted, no songs sung. People exchange 
experiences, discuss the events of the past few days.</p>

<p class="fst">I meet a young worker from Cockerill-Ougrée, the big steel works 
outside Liège. Lucien works on the night shift, in one of the tin-plating shops. 
He gives me the most vivid account of the onset of the movement I have yet 
heard.</p>

<p class="fst">The unions had first called a national demonstration for December 
15. This was the day of the royal wedding. It had officially been decreed a paid 
holiday. Under pressure from the ranks the demonstration had been brought 
forward to December 14. A massive strike took place that afternoon. Fifty 
thousand workers assembled at the Place St.-Lambert, in Liège. Many of the 
posters demanded a general strike.</p>

<p class="fst">Renard had spoken. He had concluded with the ambiguous statement: 
"Consider yourselves mobilized on a war footing ... and wait for official 
directives". The meeting had been noisy and at times angry. A member of the 
Socialist Youth had then climbed on to the balcony and attempted to address the 
crowd. He had been prevented from doing so by Party officials. PSB deputy Simon 
Paque had seized the microphone from him and had again addressed the crowd. 
"Remain ready for action. The meeting is closed".</p>

<p class="fst">I asked Lucien what had happened where he worked, on that famous 
Tuesday, December 20. "Things moved immediately. Hundreds of workers left the 
central shops. They went from shop to shop, getting the lads to down tools. 
Three thousand men gathered in the new Thomas steel plant among valuable 
equipment! It was dangerous but it's one of the biggest available places. 
Several fights took place with the trade union delegates. They were trying to 
get the men back to work until official instructions had been received. Meetings 
were promised for the next day. Why not now, the men had asked. Many remained on 
the premises to prevent the night shift from coming on. Only half the factory 
worked that night. By Wednesday morning it had come to a complete standstill. 
The Metal Workers Federation of the Liège FCTB called us all out officially as 
from the Thursday".</p>

<p class="fst">The procession has now crossed the river. The first incidents 
occur as we pass a large store that has not complied with the FGTB request. A 
group of angry demonstrators enter threateningly. Stewards hastily intervene. <i>
They</i> will talk to the manager. The demonstrators reluctantly walk out, but 
wait outside. After a few minutes, the shutters are closed. The manager has 
decided to participate in the mourning.</p>

<p class="fst">A little further on we pass a shop displaying a poster of the 
"Union of the Middle Classes". This is headed "FREEDOM FIRST". The freedom 
referred to is the freedom of scabs to work and of the Government to use all 
means to break the strike. The owner of the shop is instructed to remove the 
poster. He takes one look at the crowd and immediately obeys. Further on other 
shopkeepers start arguing. But not for long. If the offending posters do not 
disappear, the window-panes do. Noisily. The whole atmosphere gradually changes. 
The demonstrators are now on the lookout for hostile posters and for open shops 
of any size. Small shops are left strictly alone. Some of the stewards - notably 
those of the socialist students - object to the transformation taking place. 
"Remember, comrades, this is a silent procession. You must obey the official 
instructions". But their protests are of little avail. The police lining the 
pavements are powerless, as in Brussels on Thursday morning. The Union of the 
Middle Classes is in for a bad day. Instinctively the crowd is becoming aware of 
its terrific strength.</p>

<p class="fst">I am with a group of comrades associated with the weekly <i>La 
Gauche</i>. They have no illusions on the limitations of the present leadership 
of both Party and Unions. But they still seem to think that genuine solutions 
are possible within the framework of these organizations. The idea that they 
should themselves get together and issue a leaflet saying quite openly what they 
think strikes them as sectarian.</p>

<p class="fst">Ernest Mandel, editor of <i>La Gauche</i>, writes in a special 
issue of the paper (December 24):</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The workers fear that if the Government fell as a result of 
the present social crisis the Socialist Party would enter a new coalition 'so 
that the country should not become ungovernable'. The immense majority of the 
strikers will only tolerate such a reversal of the (parliamentary) alliances on 
two conditions:</p>

<p class="quoteb">a) that the new government abandon the <i>loi unique</i>, i.e. 
not only the austerity measures in the social field but also the increases in 
indirect taxation;</p>

<p class="quoteb">b) that the new ministerial programme should retain the 
essential features of the '<i>réformes de structure</i>'.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">If these two conditions are not fulfilled one must be 
resolutely opposed to any socialist participation in the Government in order to 
end the strike."</p>

<p class="fst">Mr. Mandel believes that these objectives might even be achieved 
through the bourgeois deputies. Under the heading "Decisive Moments" he writes: 
"A new parliamentary majority in relation to the questions of withdrawing the <i>
loi unique</i> and voting a law on fiscal reform and the '<i>réformes de 
structure</i>' could well emerge. It would only require that the 
Christian-Democrat deputies listen to the voices of their electors and, under 
the pressure of the strike, align themselves on the aspirations of those they 
represent".</p>

<p class="fst">Thus speaks Trotskyism, at the height of a general strike ...</p>

<h4><a name="h23">3.00 pm.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">We are driving back to Brussels in a tiny Citroen. Episodes too 
numerous to record still jostle in my mind: the sympathy with the strikers shown 
by innumerable small shopkeepers and cafe owners; the farmers supplying free 
vegetables to the Maisons du Peuple, for the communal soup kitchens; thousands 
of ordinary people discovering within themselves unlimited reserves of energy, 
initiative and devotion; men, women and children, many seriously short of sleep, 
active from dawn to dusk on the picket lines, as couriers, organizing relief, 
participating in meetings, marches and demonstrations, all imbued with an 
indomitable determination to assert their collective will, all feeling for once 
that what they do, feel, think, really matters, all dragged out of the anonymity 
and isolation of their daily lives and suddenly confronted with the 
heart-warming image of their numbers, their cohesion, their strength ...</p>

<p class="fst">I remembered what a postman told me, on the picket line at 
Brussels. "Each Christmas we sell calendars to the people in our areas. They 
give generously. We often get, at this time, what amounts to two months' pay. We 
decided nevertheless to launch this fight on December 20. We knew we would not 
fight alone".</p>

<p class="fst">He was right, of course. Solidarity action was massive and not 
confined to other workers. Early in the course of the strike, the Minister of 
the Interior had issued orders to all local <i>bourgmestres</i> (mayors) 
instructing them to report to the authorities all absences from work of local 
government employees. On December 26, the 62 socialist <i>bourgmestres</i> from 
the Liège district met and unanimously decided "to take no account of the orders 
of the minister". They proclaimed their complete solidarity with the strikers. 
Similar statements were made by meetings of the socialist <i>bourgmestres</i> of 
the Verviers, Nivelles, Charleroi, Namur, Borinage and other districts.</p>

<p class="fst">At Huy the Common Action Committee had even concluded an 
agreement with the local shopkeepers' federation, who had declared itself 
against the <i>loi unique</i> and had made financial contributions to the local 
strike fund. In Seraing, even the priests had, on Christmas day, read messages 
in their Churches expressing solidarity with the strikers. These messages were 
in marked contrast to the appeal of Cardinal van Roey, Archbishop of Malines, 
exhorting the strikers to return to work.</p>

<p class="fst">I recall how in a street in Liège, working men had been repairing 
a burst main. On their van a large poster: "We are strikers. We are working of 
our own free will, with the permission of our union, and out of consideration 
for the local population".</p>

<p class="fst">Local Government had broken down. Local initiative and 
self-reliance had replaced it. Here was the true face of the working class - the 
harbinger of a new society.</p>

<p class="fst">I recall above all a discussion with two young comrades one 
evening in Liège. One worked in a machine tool factory, the other at the 
Ateliers Jaspar, making lifts. 'The leaders tell us do this, do that. We don't 
know any longer. We, the workers, ought to decide. We are the ones that get shot 
and wounded. We are the ones they put in gaol. There will be no sell out if we 
decide how we should struggle".</p>

<p class="transcriber"><i>[Editor's note: The general strike lasted until 21 
January, when the 120,000 metal workers from the Liège and Charleroi regions 
finally returned to work. The Eyskens government was compelled to dissolve 
Parliament and in the ensuing election the governmental coalition was defeated. 
Important sections of the loi unique were never implemented and there was no 
decline in the real wages of the working class. On the other hand, the new 
government was a coalition of the Social Christians (Parti Social Chrétien), not 
only the majority in the previous administration but Eyskens's own party, and 
the Socialists (PSB); and not even any of the reformes de structure that had 
been envisaged by Ernest Mandel and the left-wing of the PSB materialized. For 
further details see Ernest Mandel, "The Dialectic of Class and Region in 
Belgium", New Left Review, no. 20 (Summer 1963), esp. pp. 24-6; and Serge Simon,

History, VII, 1 (1998).]</i></p>

Among these "reforms" are the control of the holding banks, the nationalization 
of power industries, a national economic plan and the constitution of a public 
National Investment Fund. We see no basic socialist content in any of these 
demands.</p>
