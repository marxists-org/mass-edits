<p class="fst"><i>Few of us run our own lives</i>. This is because we have no 
control over the main decisions that affect us. These decisions are made by 
small self-perpetuating minorities. This situation cannot be "democratically" 
changed. What our rulers call "democracy" is a system which operates for their 
own protection. As long as their "democracy" is not seriously challenged, their 
dominating position in society is secure.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Their threatened use of violence</i> is intended to frustrate 
any challenge. It is implicit in the large police force, the courts, and the 
armed forces which they control. The limited freedom that their "democracy" 
allows us is further restricted or curtailed altogether whenever they think 
their power is seriously threatened.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>They hold the power to maintain their power</i>. This is key 
to their security. They determine the kind of education provided, and the ways 
and means of providing it. By controlling what and how people are taught, those 
who rule us seek to preserve the structure of existing society. Children are 
educated first through the family - i.e. through the already-conditioned 
parents. Then the education factories (schools and universities) take over. 
Their aim is to produce people conditioned to fit into this rat-race society.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Workers created trade unions and political parties to change 
all this</i>. But gradually adopting similar patterns of organization to those 
of their oppressors, and by concentrating the struggle almost solely on 
improving working conditions and living standards, the original revolutionary 
intentions have been bypassed. Working people have gained considerable material 
advantages but they have lost control of their own organizations. Today the 
hierarchies are in control. They can neither be removed nor brought back to the 
initial aim of freeing people.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Those who dominate production dominate society</i>. So long as 
they have their kind of industrial stability, control will remain in their 
hands. This control enables them to continue deciding what is to be produced, 
who is to produce it, where, when how, and in what quantities. All this 
conflicts with the interests of the real producers - the workers. Those who run 
our lives continually seek ways of blurring the conflict and of manipulating 
workers into accepting that management alone is capable of making these 
decisions.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>The union hierarchy</i> assists them in this fraud. While 
acting as middlemen in the labour market, the union bosses do all they can to 
frustrate any awareness in workers of their own ability to run industry. In 
fact, so-called working class organizations are today an essential part of the 
set up. The formation of new unions or parties would not solve the problem. In 
today's conditions, they would suffer the same fate as the old ones.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>But the system is contested</i>. There is a constant struggle 
in which the objective is self-management. In a large majority of disputes, 
workers have taken real democratic decisions to act without the consent of the 
union bureaucrats (so-called unofficial strikes). This is one of the signs that 
our rulers' "industrial stability" is under strain. The strain is also visible 
in the education factories, where students are increasingly demanding the right 
to take decisions on fundamental issues. There are many other signs of the 
crisis that is affecting every aspect of this society.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Solidarity</i> participates in the struggle wherever possible. 
We try to expose the true situation. We seek to strengthen the confidence of 
working people in their <i>own</i> ability to manage their <i>own</i> lives - at 
work and outside of it. People's reliance on others to do things for them has 
led to defeat after defeat. It is time for victories! Victories depend on people 
consciously taking action themselves. To help in the development of this 
consciousness is the only reason for the existence of <i>Solidarity</i>.</p>
