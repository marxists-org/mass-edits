<p class="quoteb">"I never read a book before reviewing it. It prejudices one 
so" (<b>Sydney Smith</b>).</p>

<p class="quoteb">&quot;They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the 
other's neck, and Alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them 
had 'DUM' embroidered on his collar, and the other 'DEE'. 'I suppose they've 
each got 'TWEEDLE' round at the back of the collar', she said to herself ..." 
(<b>Lewis Carroll,</b> <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>).</p>

<p class="fst">"Capitalism and Socialism" tried to break new ground. It sought 
to differentiate the kind of critique libertarian socialists should be making of 
capitalism from the purely economic (and therefore restrictive) critique made by 
the "traditional left". The article also sought to link this more total critique 
with a complementary (more total) vision of a free society, a society in which 
man would not only be free at the level of production but also free in all other 
areas where he is at present oppressed or alienated.</p>

<p class="fst">Under the title "Bread or Freedom" the following issue of <i>
Solidarity</i> carried an attack on this article by J.S., roundly denouncing it 
as "rancid puritanism", "monasticism", "soggy humanitarianism" and "an argument 
against socialism".</p>

<p class="fst">Arguments are about ideas, and ideas cannot be wished away by 
appending labels to them, however derogatory. They have to be discussed on their 
own merit. This, J.S.'s article fails to do. Instead, like a man stung in a 
sensitive spot, he flings himself upon his horse and rides off madly in all 
directions. Two main ingredients of my original article seem to stick in J.S.'s 
throat. One is what he calls my "method", the basic weapon of which is "the 
amalgam". The other is my attack on the notion that "the conflicts and evils of 
society flow from a particular pattern of <i>ownership</i> of the means of 
production". According to J.S. "those who hold this view are correct in doing 
so". In my view this assessment of the roots of the conflict in modern society 
is both inadequate and incomplete.</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<p class="fst">The word "amalgam" implies the "lumping together" for the 
purposes of denunciation (or administrative action, such as liquidation) of 
people holding fundamentally dissimilar political viewpoints, but whose 
conjunctural objectives may superficially appear to coincide. J.S. points out 
that "Stalin could show that fascists, Trotskyists and anarchists were opposed 
to his regime. Fascists planned to invade the Soviet Union. Therefore 
Trotskyists were part of a fascist-Trotskyist conspiracy to carry out this 
invasion".<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This kind of smearing by "amalgam" is widely practiced in all 
parts of the political spectrum. It assumes a low level of political 
sophistication among those at whom it is addressed. Fascist politicians - or the 
more reactionary employers - denounce all their opponents as "reds" (without 
worrying unduly as to their doctrinal differences). Establishment Liberals call 
the Young Liberals "anarcho-syndicalists". Labour leaders appeal to the loyalty 
of their supporters, denouncing dissidence as "Tory-inspired". Trade union 
leaders, threatened with a rank-and-file challenge to their authority, can only 
think in terms of "anarchist conspiracy". "Left" critiques of the Communist 
Party are all, of course, initiated by the Economic League, and opposition to 
the General Secretary in Clapham High Street must of necessity originate in 
Scotland Yard.</p>

<p class="fst">But is the conceptual category of a "trad left" an "amalgam"? In 
politics one should not accept people at their own self-assessment, but seek 
objectively to evaluate their ideas and actions. Has the "trad left" - despite 
its squabbles - more in common than it realizes? Has it a common denominator of 
values, ideas, priorities, methods of action and methods of argument? Do its 
component parts share (whether explicitly or not) certain basic assumptions? Is 
the very heat engendered by its internal disputations the living proof that its 
publicists share common premises? "Capitalism and Socialism" asserted that there 
were such common premises and that this explained both the nature and 
limitations of the trad left's critique of capitalism and the narrowness of its 
vision of socialism might be like. There is nothing accidental in this 
phenomenon. The poisoned ideological fount is none other than the persistence of 
class society, of its values and of its ideology. The longer bourgeois or 
bureaucratic societies survive, the more deeply will bourgeois (or bureaucratic) 
ideology permeate the thinking of those who originally set out to destroy these 
societies. That "the dominant ideas of each epoch are the ideas of its ruling 
class" has now become true in a much deeper sense than Marx could have ever 
foreseen.</p>

<p class="fst">At this stage it is worth disposing of one objection voiced in 
"Bread or Freedom", namely that one cannot jointly label as trad socialists 
"those who wish to establish a society modelled on Soviet Russia <i>and</i> 
those who believe Russia is State Capitalist;<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
bureaucrats like Kosygin and Gomulka <i>and</i> revolutionary socialists like 
Kuron and Modzelewsi;<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> our present 
government <i>and</i> those who are trying to fight back against its 
anti-working class policies".<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Leaving aside the fanciful examples chosen, the implication of 
this kind of argument is that political controversy - in particular <i>heated</i> 
controversy - necessarily implies a difference over fundamentals. This just 
isn't true. When the Stalinists in Russia eliminated their Trotskyist opponents 
by methods of physical terror it was no proof that they stood for anything 
basically different. Both accepted the inability of the working class to 
transcend a trade union consciousness. Both endorsed the primacy of the party. 
Both participated in the slander and suppression of their "left" opponents, both 
outside the Party (Kronstadt) and within it (the Workers' Opposition and other 
groups).<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> The argument that 
because people fight against one another they cannot share wide common premises 
is too simple by half. Torquemada had various Catholic theologians burned at the 
stake. Is one resorting to an "amalgam" if one proclaims the <i>common</i> 
mystification of both executioner and victim, manifested in their <i>common</i> 
belief in Cod, the Catholic Church, and the necessity for a "correct" 
interpretation of Papal writ? Has J.S. never heard of "false consciousness"? Is 
the Left by some miracle, immune from it? At a cruder level, is a violent 
settlement of scores between gangsters necessarily an affirmation of deep 
ideological differentiation?</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<p class="fst">One of the charges in J.S.'s article is that I "refuse to specify 
the characteristics of the traditional left". If by "refuse" he means "omit", 
his claim is true. The article, however, was about something specific: the 
attitude of the trad left to what was wrong with capitalism. If J.S. seeks to 
widen the terms of the debate, I am quite willing. Here goes (briefly for 
shortage of space prevents full treatment of each proposition):</p>

<p class="indentb">a) Among the identifying features of the trad left (whether 
Fabian or Bolshevik) are an ingrained belief in man's incapacity to manage his 
own affairs without an elite or leadership of some kind (themselves!). In this, 
both reflect the typically bourgeois concept of "masters and men".</p>

<p class="indentb">b) The trad left places the question of formal ownership (as 
distinct from control)<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> at the 
centre of its preoccupations. It believes that solving society's economic 
problems by planning and the increase in the productivity of labour will 
necessarily result in society's other problems being solved.</p>

<p class="indentb">c) Wilson, Collan, Healy (and both Stalin and Trotsky in 
their lifetime) would all assert that Russia (economically speaking) was a 
"fundamentally different" kind of society from that existing in the West. 
Libertarian Socialists would not. It all depends on what one considers 
"fundamental". The yardstick of the former ("amalgam" again?) would be the 
presence or degree of "competition", "planning", "nationalization", etc. The 
yardstick of the latter: human freedom as expressed in workers' self-management.</p>

<p class="indentb">d) Many in the "Marxist" section of the trad left believe in 
a revolutionary theory based on allegedly objective laws. But they also hold 
that they alone can "correctly" interpret this theory (hence the multiplicity of 
the mutually hostile "Marxist" organizations). Under appropriate conditions 
these beliefs lead them to assume what Trotsky called the Party's "historical 
birthright". In defence of this birthright the Party is prepared to manipulate 
(and if necessary shoot) workers in the interest of a higher, "historically 
determined" purpose, which <i>it</i> has grasped, even if the masses haven't.</p>

<p class="fst">At the more mundane level the trad left can be recognized by its 
deeply ingrained conservatism and its ideological sterility. It is the living 
embodiment of Bagehot's aphorism that "one of the greatest pains to human nature 
is the pain of a new idea". At a time when everything is being revolutionized 
more deeply and rapidly than in any other period of history, only their 
"revolutionary" ideology seems to remain static. A "frantic search for novelty" 
(to use J.S.'s phrase) should be the prime preoccupation of those slowly sinking 
in an antediluvian morass of half-truths and outmoded concepts. But for them, as 
for all conservatives, "novelty" is a term of opprobrium.</p>

<p class="fst">Those who seem frightened of new ideas might at least rearrange 
their prejudices once in a while. But even this seems to be asking too much. In 
argument, they defend their errors as if they were defending their inheritance. 
All buttoned up by impeccable little coats of complacency, they are like a man 
who will not look at the new moon out of deference for the old one. They react 
to the ideological stimuli like Pavlovian dogs in an early stage of conditioning 
with a non-discriminatory and purely salivatory response. When for instance I 
claim that those who only see man as a consumer see him in "much less than his 
full stature", I am accused of drawing "a sharp distinction between man as a 
consumer and man's urge to fulfil himself. When I claim the "essential <i>
identity</i> of relations of domination, whether they manifest themselves in the 
capitalist factory, in the patriarchal family or in the authoritarian upbringing 
of children" and suggest that the "socialist revolution will have to take all 
these fields within its compass, and immediately", I am arraigned for describing 
fields "neatly fenced of from each other" and "not organically connected". The 
mind boggles at such feats of logic! J.S. even ends up by stating that 
"Capitalism and Socialism" "insinuates that society's ills are not due to the 
existence of the capitalist system". How much further can polemical creativity 
go? In more senses than one J.S.'s article epitomizes the response of a 
traditional Marxist when confronted with a new idea: noise, fog, distortion, 
invention, childish imputation of reactionary motives, etc, etc.</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<p class="fst">J.S. defines the nature of the capitalist system as "a particular 
pattern of <i>ownership</i> of the means of production" (my emphasis). To avoid 
being misunderstood, he defends the trad socialists in their vision of the evil 
of society as "flowing from a particular pattern of <i>ownership</i> of the 
means of production".</p>

<p class="fst">This is putting the clock back nearly a decade. It is tragedy 
that after eight years of the existence of <i>Solidarity</i> and after the 
publication of such sophisticated texts as <i>The Meaning of Socialism</i>, <i>
Socialism or Barbarism</i> and <i>Modern Capitalism and Revolution</i> there 
should persist such confusion between "property relations" and the much more 
fundamental "relations of production". This confusion can even lead J.S. to 
assert that "Capitalism and Socialism" is in "complete contradiction with <i>
Solidarity</i> practice". The contrary is in fact the case.</p>

<p class="fst">Since the first issues <i>of Solidarity</i> we have stressed that 
the crisis of contemporary society is a manifold one which cannot be fully 
understood solely in terms of the "private ownership of the means of 
production". This wider awareness has helped comrades who accept <i>Solidarity</i> 
ideas to intervene meaningfully in disputes such as King Hill, the anti-bomb 
movement, the student upsurge and in industrial disputes in which questions of 
job control were paramount. It enabled us to be the first to respond to events 
like the revolt at Berkeley (in 1964) and to recent developments in France 
(which had very little to do with "property relations" but a great deal to do 
with relations of another kind). It is a deep awareness of the totality of the 
crisis of all capitalist values and all capitalist institutions that explains 
our own survival in an initially hostile political environment and the recent 
wide response evoked by ideas similar to our own. If we had spoken exclusively 
of "property relations" or of "contradictions within the economy", we would have 
been condemned to the role of a sect because we would only have been dealing 
with <i>one</i> aspect of social reality, blowing it up to the exclusion of all 
others.</p>

<p class="fst">But "double think" can go still further. J.S. proves that it is 
possible both to believe that the crisis stems from the pattern of ownership and 
to claim that for trad socialists "the relations of production determine the 
other social relationships". Confusion not only reigns ... it pours! The trad 
socialists (Labour Party lefts, Communists, orthodox Trotskyists, Maoists, etc.) 
believe that "property relations" are paramount. The more sophisticated among 
them will claim that the juridical superstructure ("property relations") 
necessarily corresponds with the "relations of production". In fact as Marx (and 
later many others) have shown<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> the 
"property relations" may serve to mask the reality of the relations of 
production. If trad socialists ever came to acknowledge that the "relations of 
production" were fundamental, they would have to accept the relevance of our 
deepest critique of Leninism and Trotskyism, with their imposition of 
authoritarian relations in production from the earliest weeks in 1918. Sooner or 
later they would have to envisage the logical link between Leninism and 
Stalinism. This they are clearly not yet prepared to do. Neither, apparently, is 
J.S.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1]</a> The example chosen is 
(significantly?) rather a late variant of the technique. For Solidarists, more 
interesting historical antecedents would be <i>Pravda's</i> denunciation (March 
3, 1921) of the Kronstadt insurrection as "a white Guard plot ... expected and 
undoubtedly prepared by the French counter-revolution", or Lenin's assertion 
(Selected <i>Works</i>, vol. IX, p. 98) that "White Guard generals ... played a 
great role in this (the Kronstadt uprising). This is fully proved". Khrushchev 
later "proved" that the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was an American plot.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n2" href="#fn2">[2]</a> I carefully refrained from 
mentioning this political species. I am nevertheless accused of attacking them. 
Mark Twain once said: "Get your facts first, then you can distort them as much 
as you like".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> I didn't mention these 
comrades either, most of whose criticism of the Polish bureaucracy I would 
accept. Their critique, incidentally, closely parallels the arguments developed 
in issues 19, 20 and 21 of <i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i>, all of which were 
widely distributed in Poland in 1956 and early 1957. We were in fact the first 
to publish sections of the Polish text in English (<i>Solidarity</i>, IV, 2, 3 
and 4). J.S. isn't just apathetic to facts, but actively hostile to them!</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n4" href="#fn4">[4]</a> Here the imputation is 
partly correct. Only I would word it rather differently: "our present government <i>
and</i> 
those (Communist Party, Trotskyist 'entrists' of every kind) who helped put it 
there".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n5" href="#fn5">[5]</a> When, in 1927, Stalin 
arrested those responsible for the Trotskyist underground printing press (headed 
by Mrachkovsky) he was able to refute their objections without much difficulty, 
remarking: 'They say such things are unknown in the history of the Party. This 
is not true. What about the Myasnikov group? And the Workers' Truth group? Does 
not everyone know that Comrades Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev themselves 
supported the arrest of the members of these groups?" (Robert Conquest, <i>The 
Great Terror</i> (London: Macmillan, 1968), p. 130).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> As will be shown, J.S. 
shares this confusion between "property relations" (ownership) and "relations of 
production" (which are essentially authority relations).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a> See, for instance, Tony 
Cliff, Russia: <i>A Marxist Analysis</i>, or earlier texts in <i>Socialisme ou 
Barbarie</i>.</p>
