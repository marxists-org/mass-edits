<p class="fst">This pamphlet<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
produced five months after the events it describes is not really an attempt to 
analyze the French events of May and June 1968. At this level - as we shall 
show - it epitomizes the theoretical incapacity of even the more sophisticated 
representatives of the contemporary Marxist Left. The Cliff-Birchall text is 
something quite different. It is a factional document, aimed primarily at 
influencing the discussion on the "organizational question" now taking place 
within International Socialism between Leninists and libertarian 
revolutionaries.</p>

<p class="fst">After a major earthquake, everyone longs for a return to order. 
The French events are no exception. Today the Prefecture de Police wants order 
in the streets. The Minister of Education wants order in the universities. The 
CCT and Communist Party want order in the factories. And the traditional 
revolutionaries want order ... in the realm of ideas.</p>

<p class="fst">But it is the hallmark of all truly revolutionary events that 
they show no more respect for established ideas than they do for established 
institutions. All major social upheavals in history have gone far beyond the 
anticipations of even the most radical revolutionaries of the previous period. 
Whether immediately recognized or not, they have raised <i>new</i> issues, 
thrown up <i>new</i> social forms and created <i>new</i> problems of theory and 
practice. The French Revolution of 1968 was no exception.</p>

<p class="fst">During the Commune of 1871 the Paris workers put forward the 
demands for a ceiling on wages and for the eligibility and revocability of all 
officials. These demands had not been - and could not have been - anticipated in 
Marx's writings. When the first Soviets appeared in Russia in 1905 their 
significance was not apparent to Lenin or to the Bolsheviks. They had not been 
anticipated in any Party programme. But both Marx and Lenin were to incorporate 
the autonomous creations of the French and Russian workers into their own 
theoretical frameworks. It is a symptom of the degeneration of the contemporary 
Left that nothing similar has happened - or been felt necessary - in relation to 
recent events in France.</p>

<p class="fst">The pamphlet under review is like a piece of Gruyère cheese, full 
of holes and with a thick and rather mouldy rind. It fails to recognize any of 
the <i>new phenomena</i> (new in themselves or new to traditional theory) 
witnessed earlier this year in France. It fails to grasp the tremendous 
implications of the new type of issue ("self-management") around which the 
struggle was initially fought. The question of nationalization, plugged by 
revolutionaries for decades, just did not enter anyone's mind. Isn't this worthy 
of comment?</p>

<p class="fst">The traditional organizations, confronted with a human flood tide 
of this size, were initially swept aside. The massive influx into them, 
prophesied by sundry revolutionaries for years just did not materialize. In fact, 
these hollow shells only retained any residual influence to the extent that 
people had reservations as to their own capacity to manage things for 
themselves. This isn't even sensed. Instead the pamphlet learnedly dissects the 
minor fluctuations of the CGT and CFDT votes, without stressing that less than 
20% of French workers belong to a union <i>of any kind</i> - and without seeking 
to assess the deep significance of <i>that</i> phenomenon, at a time when ten 
million workers are prepared to occupy their factories in the biggest general 
strike in history.</p>

<p class="fst">The pamphlet does not sense the <i>new specific weight</i> now to 
be allocated in the revolutionary process to previously marginal layers of 
society, to new strata of the working class or even to new age groups. For 
instance, never before in history has one seen massive and militant political 
demonstrations of schoolboys aged fifteen or sixteen.</p>

<p class="fst">Nor does the pamphlet recognize the <i>new dynamic</i> through 
which the struggle unfurled, a dynamic which is itself a product of the 
increasing bureaucratization of all social institutions under modern capitalism. 
In a society where everything is planned and anticipated (except that the 
manipulated should erupt against their manipulation) deliberate and systematic 
"provocation" - like that indulged in by the March 22 Movement - can, and did, 
have profound repercussions. The <i>new revolutionaries</i> (whose ideas and 
style of action aren't even suspected as a <i>new</i> element in the situation) 
clearly anticipated the bureaucratic responses to their new pinpricks, each of 
which succeeded in escalating the conflict in the desired direction.</p>

<p class="fst">In its conclusions, the Cliff-Birchall pamphlet goes no further 
than to echo what Trotsky wrote about the French events... of June 1936. 
(Trotsky's views were probably already out of date at that time.) In discussing, 
finally, what is now needed in Britain, the authors come down - yes, wait for it 
- for a Revolutionary Party built on the principles of "democratic centralism", 
the latter defined straight out of L.D.B.'s writings of... 1924. <i>Parturiunt 
montes; nascetur ridiculus mus</i>.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The French events of May and June 1968 have sounded the death 
knell of Western bureaucratic capitalist society. But they also herald the end 
of all those "revolutionary" groups whose basic concepts of "hierarchically 
structured leadership" so integrally reflect the society around them that they 
fail to recognize that the masses themselves have already gone beyond these 
conceptions. The decomposition of "vanguardist" politics will be an integral 
part of the decomposition of bourgeois-bureaucratic authoritarianism in general. 
When this dog dies its fleas will die with it.</p>

<p class="fst">For revolutionaries who want to understand events (and not just 
tail-end them or live them as visitations from outer space) the upheaval in 
France has profound theoretical implications. In this article we can only 
formulate some of the more urgent questions which no one seems to be asking, let 
alone seeking to answer.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>1. The most clear and obvious thing about the French events is 
that, a month before they took place, their imminence and quality was clear and 
obvious to no one. Why didn't either the French Establishment - or the French 
revolutionaries -anticipate what was about to happen?</b></p>

<p class="fst">Gaullism was about to enter its tenth year. It basked in 
complacent self-confidence. It had "modernized" the French economy, extricated 
France from the Algerian imbroglio, broken free of the American embrace, 
developed a French Hydrogen Bomb, even cleaned up the facades of the Louvre and 
of the Opera. Over this period the gross national product had been increasing at 
an average rate of 5% per annum (in volume terms, i.e. at constant prices) and 
real wages by about the same amount. True, over the last eighteen months, 
unemployment had been rising slightly,<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> 
but by and large the economic basis of the regime seemed fairly stable. Not even 
the most percipient of Gaullists could have sensed the social cataclysm that lay 
immediately ahead.</p>

<p class="fst">But neither had this been sensed by the revolutionaries. A 
perusal of <i>Voix Ouvrière</i>, <i>Révoltes</i>, or <i>Avant-Garde</i> for the 
early months of 1968 gives no inkling of awareness that France was on the 
threshold of a major convulsion. The content of these papers could have been 
written at any time during the last ten (or twenty, or thirty) years. They 
contained the usual denunciations of the economic policy of the government, the 
usual "exposures" of the "betrayals" of the CGT and of the Communist Party 
(combined with descriptions of perennially unsuccessful attempts to capture 
positions within these outfits), the usual prognostications as to the likelihood 
of slump in the more or less distant future (on account of the "insurmountable 
economic contradictions of capitalism"), the customary denunciation of the 
latest crime of the Stalinist bureaucracy, and the ritual epilogue: the need to 
build the revolutionary party of Leninist type (of which each tendency saw 
itself as the sole, historically-predetermined nucleus). Early in 1968, all this 
was being recited as usual, but without any <i>special</i> sense of urgency.</p>

<p class="fst">This convergence of outlooks between Establishment and 
established revolutionaries is really most interesting. Its deep roots lie in 
the fact that both used the same kind of yardstick. They looked at production, 
consumption, wages and employment. They used the same kind of thermometer to 
assess the clinical condition of the body politic. They both looked for the same 
kind of symptoms of possible disease. Neither seemed aware that new diseases 
might develop, with symptoms of an entirely new kind, or that the thermometer 
itself might now be quite the wrong kind of instrument with which to diagnose 
them. From opposite sides of the (then largely metaphorical) barricades they 
shared a common outlook on life. When Marx said that the dominant ideas of each 
epoch were the ideas of its ruling class, little did he foresee how deeply true 
this statement would one day become.</p>

<p class="fst">It is of little concern to revolutionaries that the bourgeoisie 
should have been incapable of foreseeing the crisis towards which it was 
heading. What should concern them, however, are the shortcomings of their own 
philosophy, with its bold claim to be the means "not only of interpreting the 
world, but of changing it".</p>

<p class="fst">We don't want to be misunderstood. Our critique is not that 
traditional theory failed to predict the precise moment when the upheaval would 
take place. It's not a question of faulty revolutionary chronometry. (Only the 
crudest determinists have ever attempted to use Marxism in this way.) It is a 
question of whether established Marxist categories can now provide even an 
elementary insight into the kind of upheaval that is on the historical agenda. 
In relation to France, they clearly failed. Why? And what are the implications 
of this failure? What would aircraft pilots say of a brand of radar that didn't 
even suspect, in the immediate vicinity, the presence of a mountain 20,000 feet 
high?</p>

<p class="fst"><b>2. The second lot of questions flow automatically from the 
first. Are the traditional criteria (level of employment, level of consumption, 
etc.) still adequate in assessing the social tensions within a given society and 
hence the proximity or otherwise of a revolutionary upheaval? Or do they need to 
be replaced or amplified by other criteria, more difficult to quantify (sense of 
alienation, sense of dissatisfaction with the nature of work or the quality of 
life, rejection of established values, gap between expectations and reality, 
desire to break out of the proletarian condition, whatever the level of wages, 
etc.). The main danger here is to avoid a lapse into mysticism. But even 
Marxists must admit that "man does not live by bread alone" ...</b></p>

<p class="fst">Both bourgeois and revolutionary historians have until now seen 
the preconditions of social revolution in mainly economic terms. Men have 
revolted because the social system has been incapable of providing them with the 
basic economic necessities of life. Past revolutionary upheavals have tended to 
occur in condition of economic duress, or in the wake of wars, or both (Paris, 
1871; Russia, 1905 and 1917; Germany, 1918; Hungary, 1919; the British General 
Strike, 1926; the Belgian General Strike, 1960-61). This has never been a 
thoroughly satisfactory explanation of revolutionary upheavals (Spain 1936 and 
Hungary 1956 have always been notoriously difficult to interpret on this basis). 
We believe this kind of interpretation is likely to be less and less 
satisfactory in the future.</p>

<p class="fst">The French Thunderbolt fell out of a fairly clear economic sky. 
The students whose struggle played so important a role were not starving. Over 
90% of them were of bourgeois or petty bourgeois origin. The workers at 
Sud-Aviation and Renault, who initiated the factory occupations, were among the 
best paid in the country. The "traditional" criteria do not help one understand 
the real nature of such events.</p>

<p class="fst">We don't doubt that those who are unable to develop a new idea of 
their own will now devote their energy and time to skillful use of the 
"retrospectroscope". They will belatedly discern in the pattern of industrial 
struggle in France, during the early months of 1968, the obvious harbingers of 
what in fact followed. The pamphlet under review does this at some length. The 
endeavour is rather pointless however. The man-hours lost through strikes during 
1967 or during the first three months of 1968 have certainly been exceeded on 
many occasions during other arbitrary three or twelve month periods of the 
Gaullist reign. The fairly recent police violence against workers at Rhodiaceta 
(Lyon), Caen and Redon had had its bloody antecedents during the great miners' 
strike of 1949 and in the Charonne massacre of 1962. The level of unemployment 
may have risen from 1.5% to 2% of the labour force during the last few months 
but this in itself hardly represents the transgression of some critical point 
below which nothing happens and above which everything suddenly becomes possible 
(unemployment levels incidentally have been consistently higher in Britain).</p>

<p class="fst">One has to look elsewhere for the beginnings of an 
interpretation. The "old mole of history" had been burrowing deep. The 
bureaucratic society had generated new tensions of its own - some of which are 
clearly anticipated in Cardan's <i>Modern Capitalism and Revolution</i><a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a>. 
The gulf between expectations and reality had been steadily widening and this 
not only in relation to consumption. So had the gulf between order-givers and 
order-takers, at all levels of society. Attitudes had been changing - even 
attitudes to the presence of 400,000 unemployed. Traditional values had been 
disintegrating. Whole new layers of society had been proletarianized, <i>not</i> 
according to the Marxist model of absolute or relative pauperization, but in the 
sense of a profound transformation of the nature of their world. The increasing 
bureaucratization of society at all levels had not only rendered the traditional 
organization meaningless for hundreds of thousands of young people, but had also 
ensured that those in authority were less and less capable of understanding and 
controlling a reality whose real nature constantly eluded them.</p>

<p class="fst">It is on the basis of considerations such as these - however 
tenuous and inadequately defined at the moment - that one should attempt a 
reconstruction of revolutionary theory. Ideas cannot remain static while reality 
changes - nor can a new reality be grasped without a revolution in ideas. 
Religion may reflect a neurotic insecurity when confronted with the unknown. It 
is a form of false consciousness. Traditional theory is now in danger of playing 
exactly the same role.</p>

<p class="fst">But there is nothing as painful as a new idea. Some will deny the 
need for any kind of theoretical framework or - at most - will cling to a few 
primitive slogans (state: bad; self-activity: good). Others will prefer to hang 
on to a schema which they sense to be inadequate rather than embark on the 
difficult yet imperative task now confronting serious revolutionaries - that of 
the collective elaboration of a new revolutionary theory.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>3. Why did the revolutionary upheaval start among the 
students? Why did they struggle with such militancy and courage? Was their 
revolt just a "spark" or "fuse" which "detonated" the working class? Or has it a 
deeper significance at its own level?</b></p>

<p class="fst">Two attitudes seem to be emerging on this subject. Both are 
inadequate.</p>

<p class="fst">One attitude, epitomized in the <i>Black Dwarf</i> (and also put 
forward in some of the writings of the German SDS), sees the students as the 
"new revolutionary vanguard". It assigns to them the role assigned to the 
proletariat in classical revolutionary theory. It more or less explicitly puts 
forward the view that the working class is becoming or had become integrated 
into the "affluent society" and that it has lost all revolutionary potential.</p>

<p class="fst">Cliff and Birchall correctly take Wright Mills and Marcuse to 
task for "denying the revolutionary potentiality of the working class" and for 
"describing students and intellectuals as the main vehicle for revolutionary 
action now and in the future". But it is interesting - although hardly 
surprising - that they fail to identify the real fount of this pernicious 
doctrine. In 1901 Kautsky (in his draft programme for the Austrian 
Social-Democratic Party) wrote that it was "absolutely untrue" that socialist 
consciousness was a "necessary and direct result of the proletarian class 
struggle". "Modern socialist consciousness could arise only on the basis of 
profound scientific knowledge". "The vehicle of science was not the proletariat 
but the bourgeois intelligentsia". "Socialist consciousness is something 
introduced into the proletarian struggle from without".<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> 
Lenin, in his <i>What Is To Be Done?</i>, endorsed Kautsky's views on this 
matter describing them as a "profoundly true and important utterance".<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> 
The ideological premise for this conclusion was Lenin's belief that "the working 
class, by its own efforts, is able only to develop trade union consciousness".<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> 
It requires no great effort to understand all the substitutionist practices that 
must inevitably flow - and have inevitably flowed - from such a conception. In 
their absolute rejection of the notion that the working class, through its own 
experiences in modern industrial society, can, does and must autonomously accede 
to a socialist consciousness, Marcuse and Lenin have more in common than the 
followers of either would like to believe.</p>

<p class="fst">The fallacy of this first attitude should be obvious. If the 
working class cannot come to understand socialism - and want it - there can be 
no socialist perspective. There can only be the replacement of one ruling elite 
by another. However "enlightened" and "revolutionary" the new elite may be, it 
will sooner or later come to express its own interests, rather than those of the 
working class.</p>

<p class="fst">The second attitude to students (shared by most "orthodox" 
Marxists) is less naive but just as short-sighted. It correctly sees the 
students as a minority in modern industrial society, the need for the majority 
to move if anything fundamental is to happen and the fact that this majority, in 
advanced industrial countries, is the working class. Its inadequacy is that it 
cannot transcend the conception of student action as just a "catalyst", "fuse" 
or "spark", capable of igniting the powder kegs of industrial discontent but 
devoid of any deeper significance at its own level.</p>

<p class="fst">This is to underestimate the increasing importance (and 
increasing vulnerability) today of both the university and of education 
generally. Both help maintain the social cohesion of class society. Reinforcing 
patriarchal authority, both help perpetuate (at the ideological level) the 
prevailing relations of hierarchy and domination. In the long run both prove 
more effective mechanisms for helping the slaves accept their slavery than 
either police or prison. In the realm of ideas they provide the basic mechanism 
for the replication of bourgeois-bureaucratic society, of its values and 
assumptions, generation after generation. But the <i>lycées</i> and universities 
of France are now full of students, with heads full of "subversive" thoughts. 
The night-long discussions of last May, in occupied schools and faculties, among 
young people, will leave indelible marks.</p>

<p class="fst">The university churns out the technologists, sociologists, 
industrial psychologists, computer programmers, managers, time-and-motion 
experts, in short the whole administrative personnel of the modern industrial 
machine. In France substantial numbers of students began to refuse the future 
role assigned to them as "watchdogs of capital". If this mood lasts (and 
particularly if it spreads beyond the faculties of sociology, philosophy or 
psychology), the effects could be profound. In May even such traditional 
disciplines as medicine and law were not immune from the general ferment. 
Closing particular faculties or even whole universities would be a double-edged 
weapon for the authorities, an open admission of failure, a permanent mutilation 
of the liberal image they have been at such pains to protect.</p>

<p class="fst">Workers on strike can stop assembly lines. But a deep 
implantation of "subversives" in universities could disrupt the mass production 
of conformist cadres, and prove an additional spoke in the wheels of bourgeois 
society. The Establishment can tolerate students demanding bigger credits for 
higher education. It cannot tolerate demands that the universities "be converted 
into Red bases", or that they "provide facilities for continuous political 
forums, open to all", etc. Revolutionaries in France now see the universities as 
permanent foci of contestation of bourgeois ideology, permanent running sores on 
the body of bourgeois society. The current backwardness of the student movement 
in Britain makes it difficult for us soberly to conceive of this here, but last 
year few in France would have thought it possible either. The theory of French 
"exceptionalism" - based on such undoubted realities as the rigidity of official 
French institutions, the widespread hatred of the <i>flics</i> (cops) in France, 
and the undoubted French aptitude for critical revolutionary thought - should 
not be taken too far.</p>

<p class="fst">These aspects of what the students did in May 1968 differ from 
what "intellectuals" have done in previous revolutions (1871, 1917, or even in 
Hungary in 1956). Then, they helped articulate popular demands. Now, by making 
radical demands of their own, demands which cannot be encompassed by the system, 
they are opening a second front in the onslaught against bourgeois society. 
Fully aware of the dangers of being trapped in a "ghetto" of university 
politics, the modern French revolutionaries also reject the false alternative of 
struggling for purely student demands or total and exclusive immersion in the 
working class fight. This new type of consciousness isn't even hinted at in the 
Cliff-Birchall pamphlet.</p>

<p class="fst">The totality of the student rejection of bourgeois society 
explains the totality of their dedication to the revolutionary cause and the 
totality of their involvement in the struggle on the streets. It was not the 
product of economic misery. It reflected something more fundamental. The 
students were being denied the right to be themselves - and had become aware of 
the fact. They were not risking loss of sight and limb (amid the gas grenades 
and batons of the CRS) for a 3% annual increase in the size of the educational 
budget. They were fighting for the right to reappropriate what bourgeois society 
was taking from them. When this dormant consciousness is aroused in other layers 
of the population, the effect will be irresistible. <i>This</i> is the real 
lesson and hope of the French events of May 1968.</p>

related to the sudden increase in births in the years which immediately followed 
the war (1945-1950). The "overcrowding" in the universities is partly due to the
