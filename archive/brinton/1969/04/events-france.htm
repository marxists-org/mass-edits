<p class="fst">This book,<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
although hastily compiled to meet the mass demand for such works which followed 
the events of May 1968, is nevertheless essential reading. It is an exciting 
piece of living history, written by articulate and active participants, one of 
whom became the spokesman for a wide layer of student revolutionaries. The 
original French version was called <i>Le Gauchisme - remède à la maladie sénile 
du communisme</i> - a witty and meaningful rejoinder to Lenin's denunciation of 
left-wing communism as an "infantile disorder". The English title is 
unfortunately quite meaningless.</p>

<p class="fst">Starting with the student revolt in modern industrial societies, 
the authors analyze the background to the March 22 Movement, the spread of the 
ideas of May to sections of the working class, the strategy of the bourgeois 
state, the Gaullist phenomenon and - in considerable detail - the role of the 
Communist Party and its historical roots in ideology and previous practice.</p>

<p class="fst">The authors' thinking is throughout clearly influenced by 
material published in <i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i>, <i>Internationale 
Situationniste</i>, <i>Informations et Correspondance Ouvrières</i>, <i>Noir et 
Rouge</i>, and <i>Recherches Libertaires</i>, an ideological debt freely, but 
rather erratically, acknowledged. The "plagiarism" is extensive, intelligently 
selective and thoroughly commendable, ensuring a wide audience for views as yet 
insufficiently known. Great chunks, for instance, of the Solidarity Pamphlet on <i>
The Workers' Opposition</i> are to be found in the authors' discussion of the 
nature of Bolshevism. As the authors nicely put it: "Cohn-Bendit is simply the 
anonymous author of all these reviews".</p>

<p class="fst">I have but one criticism and it has been voiced before. It is a 
note of scepticism concerning the implied proximity of total revolution. It is 
hard to accept that, last May, it was touch and go whether everything would be 
swept aside. Or to believe that if, on the morning of May 25, Paris had awoken 
with several ministries occupied, Gaullism would have collapsed ... and 
self-management become an objective immediately to be fulfilled.</p>

<p class="fst">The grip of class society unfortunately exerts itself at a much 
deeper level than the authors appear to suspect. Even the decomposition of 
bourgeois state power -and one could argue whether it was as profound as they 
believe - is no guarantee that bourgeois institutions will be replaced by 
consciously created socialist ones. The essential precondition for a radical and 
total social transformation is the change, brought about through the class 
struggle itself, in the attitudes of the mass of the population, i.e. the 
working class. These attitudes today are not only coloured by the traditional 
organizations but are constantly reinforced by the very conditions of capitalist 
production and of life in capitalist society (passivity of workers subjected to 
domination by machines, pressure of financial insecurity, preoccupation with 
only immediate things, etc.). These attitudes (which add up to the more or less 
widespread acceptance of slavery by the majority of the slaves) are one of the 
main causes for the perpetuation of bourgeois or bureaucratic rule. (Other 
factors act in an opposite direction, constantly compelling people to question 
the methods, priorities and relations of capitalist production.) The ideological 
superstructure of capitalist society isn't as fragile as many revolutionaries 
seem to think. It has enormous resilience and to shatter it a whole epoch of 
sustained and conscious struggle will be necessary. The French events 
undoubtedly initiated such a period. But by ignoring this facet the Cohn-Bendit 
book at times unconsciously lapses into a system of ideas in which the role of 
active minorities would seem to be paramount. Paradoxically it is a system of 
ideas which thus explicitly formulated the authors would be the first to reject.</p>
