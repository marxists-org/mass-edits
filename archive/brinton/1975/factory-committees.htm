<hr>

<p class="fst">It is a welcome sign of the times that a serious exchange of 
radical opinion is now under way concerning the formative period of the Russian 
state, and <i>Critique</i> is to be congratulated on having played a part in the 
initiation of this discussion. How deep the confrontation goes will, of course, 
depend on how open the journal remains to those in the revolutionary movement 
who do not accept the label of "Marxist", but who feel they may nevertheless 
have something of relevance to contribute.</p>

<p class="fst">In your last issue, Chris Goodey claims that "it is only the 
current practice and experience of the world movement for socialist revolution 
that is beginning to allow us an overall view of the battle-stations which we 
have unthinkingly maintained for a long time". In a very general sense that is, 
of course, true. But elements of a serious critique antedated - and by a 
considerable period - "May 1968 in France, the Prague events and the Chilean 
Revolution". Some of those who initiated this critique would moreover shudder to 
find themselves subsumed under the "we" that Goodey refers to. They did not wait 
until the late sixties to express their views. As early as 1918 they had clearly 
seen the direction in which Russian society was moving and proclaimed a 
principled opposition, often at the cost of their lives. It is a tragic fact, 
for which Leninists of all kinds (Stalinists, Trotskyists, Maoists, and the 
advocates of various theories of "state capitalism", i.e. International 
Socialists, Bordigists, "Marxist Humanists", etc.) must carry their full share 
of responsibility, that we know less today about the early weeks of Russian 
Revolution than we do, for instance, about the history of the Paris Commune.</p>

<p class="fst">"Unfortunately it is not the workers who write history. It is 
always 'the others.' "<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> "Official" 
historians seldom have eyes to see or ears to hear the acts and words which 
express the autonomous activity of the working class. They think in terms of 
institutions, congresses, leaders. In the best instances they will vaunt 
rank-and-file activity as long as it coincides with their own conceptions. But 
they "will radically condemn it or impute the basest of motives to it as soon as 
it deviates from that line".<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> They 
seem to lack the categories of thought necessary to perceive life as it really 
is. To them an activity which has no leader or programme, no institutions and no 
statutes, can only be conceptualized as "troubles", "disorder", "anarchy". In 
the words of Cardan "the spontaneous activity of the masses belongs, by 
definition, to what history suppresses".<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Goodey is correct when he claims it is "part of the revolutionary 
process to demystify our own history" and when he points out that the struggle 
for "direct forms of working people's power at the point of production" has been 
"hidden and ignored". (The formulation in the passive is, however, disingenuous. 
By whom was it hidden? And why was it ignored?) But he is profoundly wrong when 
he attributes this silence of the "Marxist left" to such ideological 
shortcomings as lack of "temerity" or insufficient "capacity for self-criticism". 
A proper evaluation of these matters cannot but lead, for anyone with even 
moderate pretensions to intellectual honesty, to a complete break with Leninism 
in all its aspects and to a re-examination of certain basic Marxist beliefs.</p>

<p class="fst">A steady trickle of documentation is now coming to light 
concerning the role of the Factory Committees in the Russian Revolution.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> 
Goodey sees these Committees as "the most powerful institution in Russia by the 
end of 1917" and in this he is certainly right. He is also correct in claiming 
that "this power later submerged". What is lacking in his article, however, is 
the serious attempt to explain what happened in between, when it happened, why 
it happened, and to whom it happened. The "submergence" of which Goodey speaks 
was well advanced, if not virtually completed, by May 1918, i.e. <i>before</i> 
the Civil War and the "Allied" intervention really got under way. The 
traditional explanations of the degeneration of the Russian revolution are just 
not good enough.</p>

<p class="fst">In my view, Goodey's silence on these essential questions is 
unavoidable. It flows directly from his honestly declared political position. He 
sees Party and State as "indirect forms of workers' power", and explicitly 
absolves the Leninist Party from any blame in the degeneration. He claims that 
"even in our present world, in spite of the fact that bureaucratic degeneration 
is inherent in the 'workers' state' and the 'workers' party, these are still the 
necessary complement to forms of direct workers' power". He only conceives these 
forms of direct workers' power as "effective anti-bodies against that 
degeneration". He nowhere posits them as the necessarily dominant units in the 
initiation of policy, in other words as the basic nuclei of the new society. 
With this kind of overall outlook a serious analysis of the smashing of the 
Factory Committees is virtually impossible, for the Bolshevik Party was to play 
a dominant role in this tragedy. There is nothing more utopian than the belief 
that the Russian working class could have maintained its power through a 
"workers' party" or a "workers' state" when it had already lost that power at 
the point of production.</p>

<p class="fst">I have elsewhere<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> 
sought to bring together material from disparate sources and to document as 
concisely and yet as fully as possible the various stages of a process which 
led, within the short period of four years, from the tremendous upsurge of the 
Factory Committee movement (a movement which both implicitly and explicitly 
sought to alter the relations of production) to the establishment of 
unquestioned domination by a monolithic and bureaucratic agency (the Party) over 
all aspects of economical and political life. I argued that as this agency was 
not itself based on production, its rule could only epitomize the continued 
limitation of the authority of the workers in the productive process. This 
necessarily implied the perpetuation within society at large.</p>

<p class="fst">It is impossible, within the space available, to recapitulate all 
the evidence here. The first stage of the process under discussion was the 
subordination of the Factory Committees to the All-Russian Council for Workers' 
Control in which the unions (themselves already strongly under Party influence) 
were heavily represented. This took place very shortly after the coming to power 
of the Soviet Government. The second phase - which almost immediately followed 
the first - was the incorporation of this All-Russian Council for Workers' 
Control into the Vesenka (Supreme Economic Council), even more heavily weighted 
in favour of the unions, but also comprising direct nominees of the state (i.e. 
of the Party). By early 1918 the Bolsheviks were actively seeking to merge the 
Committees into the trade union structures. The issue provoked heated 
discussions at the First All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions (January 7-14, 
1918) which saw desperate attempts, led mainly by anarcho-syndicalists, to 
maintain the autonomy of the Committees, against the advice Ryazanov who urged 
the Committees "to commit suicide by becoming an integral element of the trade 
union structure".<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> During the next 
two years a sustained campaign was waged to curb the power of the unions 
themselves, for the unions, albeit in a very indirect and distorted way, could 
still be influenced by the working class. It was particularly important for the 
new bureaucracy to replace this power by the authority of direct party nominees. 
These managers and administrators, nearly all appointed from above, gradually 
came to form the basis of a new ruling class. The important point, as far as the 
re-evaluation of history is concerned, is that each of these steps was to be 
resisted, but each fight was to be lost. Each time, the "adversary" appeared in 
the garb of the new "proletarian" power. And each defeat was to make it more 
difficult for the working class itself directly to manage production, i.e. 
fundamentally to alter its status as a subordinate class.</p>

<p class="fst">Goodey claims that the "essence of the libertarian argument is 
that the level of the productive forces plays a less determining role in the 
development of history than the existence of hierarchy: in the revolutionary 
process that hierarchy takes the form of 'authoritarianism' among the leaders 
(in this case the Bolshevik Party) and 'false consciousness' among the masses in 
submitting to what they consider their natural leaders". It is difficult to know 
from where he can derive such a crudely psychological formulation of the 
libertarian case. As far as I know, no libertarian has argued that the level of 
the productive forces is either "more" or "less" important than the role of 
ideas and attitudes in influencing historical development. Both are important. 
What libertarians have stressed (and most Marxists have signally refused to 
recognize) is that the conceptions and attitudes of the dominant Party were as 
much an objective fact of history - influencing the evolution of events at 
critical moments - as were production statistics for electricity or steel.</p>

<p class="fst">Goodey claims that the libertarian argument "can be nailed quite 
easily" and I find it a compliment that he should choose my essay on which to 
practice his skills as a carpenter. He focuses attention on one particular 
episode I describe in the hope that by challenging its factual accuracy he can 
somehow impugn the credibility of the rest. He correctly defines the area of the 
discussion. "The argument is that Lenin and Bolshevik leaders suppressed the 
factory committees immediately on the seizure of Power, because they held too 
much real power". Right on! Goodey is also correct in attributing to me the view 
"the legislation on workers' control immediately after October was elaborated in 
totally different ways by Lenin and by the committees' leaders". Again, right 
on! There is abundant evidence (summarized in my text) to substantiate this 
view. The Achilles' heel of my thesis is allegedly my reference to a document 
drawn up by certain members of the Central Council of Petrograd Factory 
Committees on how the economy should have been run immediately after the October 
events. I am quite prepared to take up the challenge on this rather narrow 
basis.</p>

<p class="fst">According to Goodey (and he devotes three pages to the matter) my 
knowledge of the document in question was "fifth hand". I had inherited from one 
Didier Limon<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> "an amputated 
quotation, bearing the wrong date, the wrong title, and the wrong authors". I 
had then "rewritten the text". Strong stuff. Unfortunately, on every single 
point Goodey is wrong.</p>

<p class="fst">According to Goodey the fateful history of this document was as 
follows. It was originally published in part in <i>Izvestia</i> (December 7, 
1917) and fully in <i>Narodnoe Khozyaistvo</i> (no. 1, 1918). Lozovsky, a 
Bolshevik trade unionist, allegedly altered its title from "Draft Instructions 
on Workers' Control" to "Practical Manual for the Execution of Workers' 
Control". This was done in his book, <i>Rabochii Kontrol</i>, which according to 
Goodey was written "in November of 1917". (Goodey does not explain how Lozovsky 
could, in November 1917, have been distorting the title of a text that had not 
yet been published, but this is a minor point.) Then, still according to 
Goodey's chronology, Pankratova took up the text in her writings of 1923.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> 
For reasons of her own she dated it February 6, 1918 (i.e. after the First Trade 
Union Congress, which sought to "fuse from above" the Factory Committees and the 
Unions). Goodey is to be congratulated in detecting this early piece of 
falsification by one of Stalin's pet historians. But the relevance of this to 
what either Limon or I wrote totally escapes me: neither of us gave the wrong 
date for the text under discussion.</p>

<p class="fst">According to Goodey, Limon takes over from Pankratova "the wrong 
title and the wrong date and adds his own embellishments". He truncates a 
quotation in the text and changes the authorship of the original document, 
attributing it to the "non-Bolshevik leaders of the All-Russian Council of the 
Factory Committees". On all these scores, Goodey is wrong. Limon did <i>not</i> 
get his facts<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> via Pankratova. The 
"secret" can now be let out of the bag. Limon got his facts from someone who had 
seen the documentation at the first hand, and before Pankratova had even thought 
of writing about it. I have also seen this original source. Even Goodey could 
have had access to it, had he been less concerned in proving the bad faith of 
those he disagrees with politically, and had he chosen to check with Limon. 
(Limon is, after all, on the Editorial Board of <i>Autogestion</i>, for which 
Goodey is the "correspondent for Great Britain".)</p>

<p class="fst">The "original" source is Chapter 8 ("Les Soviets d'usine à 
l'oeuvre") of Max Hoschiller's book <i>Le Mirage Sovietique</i> (Paris: Payot, 
1921). Hoschiller was a French revolutionary who spoke Russian well. The 
authenticity of his account is vouched for by no less a figure than André 
Merrheim who wrote the Preface to Hoschiller's book.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> 
It was in fact at Merrheim's suggestion that Hoschiller went to Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">Now what does Hoschiller say as to the authorship, the title, and 
the content of the controversial document?</p>

<p class="fst">Hoschiller makes it clear that in the weeks preceding the 
revolution it was the anarchists who were striking the tune ("<i>donnaient le la</i>") 
in the Factory Committees and that the Bolsheviks could only trail along after 
them ("<i>étaient bien obligés de marcher à leur remorque</i>"). On December 7, 
1917, the decree setting up the Vesenkha (Supreme Economic Council) was 
promulgated.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> The Vesenkha 
comprised some members of the All-Russian Council of Workers' Control (a very 
indirect sop to the Factory Committees), massive representation of all the new 
Commissariats and a number of experts, nominated from above, in a consultative 
capacity. According to Hoschiller the leaders of the Factory Committees, 
dissatisfied with Lenin's concessions ("<i>mécontents en dépit de toutes les 
concessions du chef du gouvernement</i>"), did not implement the decisions but 
elaborated their own decree in the form of a "Practical Manual for the 
Implementation of Workers' Control" ("<i>élaborerent leur pro-pre décret sous 
forme d'un</i> '<i>Manuel Pratique pour l'Execution du Contrôle Ouvrier</i>' "). 
Hoschiller describes how jealously he had kept the eight great in-folio sheets, 
printed in double columns, that had been widely distributed in the streets of 
Petrograd. He has clearly seen the original, which is more than can be said with 
any confidence of Lozovski, Pankratova ... or even of Goodey.</p>

<p class="fst">Goodey then takes issue with Limon's attribution of this text to 
the "non-Bolshevik leaders of the All-Russian Council of Factory Committees". Is 
he really suggesting that the "Manual" was a Party document? Reference to the 
Hoschiller text shows that it was no such thing. One particular prescription of 
the "Manual" epitomizes this point. The "Manual" spoke of "Regional Federations 
of Factory Committees" and of the need for a "National Union of Factory 
Committees". But even Deutscher is forced to point out that such demands were 
diametrically opposed to Party policy at the time. "A few weeks after the 
upheaval the Factory Committees attempted to form their own national 
organization ... The Bolsheviks now called upon the trade unions to render a 
special service to the nascent Soviet State and to discipline the Factory 
Committees. The unions came out firmly against the attempt of the Factory 
Committees to form a national organization of their own. They prevented the 
convocation of a planned All-Russian Congress of Factory Committees".<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> 
It ill behoves various Bolsheviks, after all this, to denounce the Factory 
Committees as only having had parochial preoccupations.</p>

<p class="fst">Two other facts stress the wide divergence of approach already 
obvious at this stage between the Leninists and the leaders of the Factory 
Committees. First the very real difficulties Lenin experienced in getting wide 
support for his "Draft Decrees on Workers' Control". These were originally 
published in <i>Pravda</i> (on November 3, 1917) but only ratified by the 
V.Ts.I.K. (All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Soviets) eleven days 
later, after heated opposition from the rank and file of the Factory Committees.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> 
Secondly the fact that <i>Izvestiya</i> (December 13, 1917) found it necessary 
to publish a text ("General Instructions on Workers' Control in Conformity with 
the Decree of November 14") which became widely known as the "Counter-Manual".</p>

<p class="fst">Concerning the substance of the passage under dispute 
Hoschiller's text makes it crystal clear that Limon has "amputated" nothing. 
Quoting from the introduction to the "Manual", Hoschiller (p. 167) writes that 
workers' control "<i>ne doit pas être consideré dans le sens étroit d'une 
révision mais dans le sens plus large de</i> '<i>l'ingerance</i>' ". Full stop. (A full 
stop put by Hoschiller, not by Limon. And a reasonable place, I would have 
thought, at which to end a quotation.) That my own reference to this document 
included, through the carelessness of a misplaced unquote, a few words that were 
Limon's hardly constitutes "rewriting the text" and alters precisely nothing to 
the substance of the matter.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">So there you have it. No plot. No "fifth hand knowledge" of a 
"shop-soiled" quotation. No Lozovsky as the "evident" original secondary source 
of all the rest. No wrong dates inherited from Pankratova. No Limon changing the 
authorship of the document. No truncating of quotations. All these are figments 
of Goodey's imagination and he should clearly stop prattling about "attitudes to 
verifiable facts". If this is really the best your contributor can do to "nail" 
the libertarian argument those who manufacture bandages for sore thumbs are in 
for a boom.</p>

<p class="fst">But let us return to the main argument. Goodey claims that "if 
... there was a nascent bureaucracy in 1917, then the Factory Committees were 
part of it". This is totally to misunderstand the concept of bureaucracy. It 
attributes to the word a restricted meaning, of little value to those who seek 
radically to change society. The classical Marxist conceptions are here totally 
inadequate. A bureaucracy is not just "officialdom" or a "social stratum 
enjoying certain material privileges" or a "gendarme, ensuring a certain pattern 
of distribution under conditions of want". If the concept of self-management is 
to have any meaning a bureaucracy must be seen as a group seeking to manage <i>
from the outside</i> the activities of others. If that group has a monopoly of 
decisional authority, its bureaucratic potential will be vastly enhanced. In 
this sense if there was a nascent bureaucracy by the end of 1917 in Russia it 
was certainly not to be found in the Factory Committees. It was to be found in 
the Party itself. Certain Party attitudes here played a very important role. 
Trotsky himself (if we must refer to him) perceptively described all this. 
Referring to the Third Party Congress (April 25-May 10, 1905) he spoke of "the 
young revolutionary bureaucrat already emerging as a type. They were far more 
intransigent and severe with the revolutionary working men than with themselves, 
preferring to domineer".<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> No 
less a man than Lenin had written that "a worker-agitator who shows any talent 
should not work in the factory".<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> 
Is it any wonder that with these conceptions the Party soon lost all contact 
with the class?</p>

<p class="fst">Goodey seeks to prove his point that the Factory Committees 
belong to the nascent bureaucracy by looking at the later careers of certain 
Factory Committees' leaders: men such as Chubar, Matvei, Zhivotov and Skrypnik. 
That non-Bolshevik leaders of the Factory Committees later supported the 
Bolsheviks is indisputable. But so what? It is not unknown for individual shop 
stewards to end up as foremen. Does this really prove anything beyond the 
capacity of established power, in its various garbs, to recuperate dissent? Does 
the fact that Alexandra Kollontai later became a Stalinist ambassador invalidate 
her earlier writings on the emancipation of women? Does Trotsky's later 
Bolshevism invalidate his prophetic warnings of 1904 on the subject of the Party 
substituting itself for the working class?<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">If Goodey is really interested in the history of what happened to 
the personnel of the Factory Committees (and not to just a few of their leaders) 
a fruitful area might be the history of the various syndicalist groups, and in 
particular of the "Revolutionary Centre of Factory Committees", a body of 
anarchist inspiration which competed for a while with the All-Russian Council of 
Factory Committees, without ever succeeding in supplanting it, so many were the 
obstacles put in its path. The search will, I suspect, prove disappointing. 
Systematic persecution of "left" dissidents soon became a way of life. 
Proletarian partisans of the individual Factory Committees tried to resist and 
to regroup but their resistance was easily overcome.<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> 
The search also might encompass the fate of groupings of Bolshevik origin, such 
as Masnikov's <i>Workers' Group</i> (an offspring from the Workers' Opposition) 
and of Bogdanov's <i>Workers' Truth</i>. One fact such a search will reveal - 
and of this there can be little doubt - is that this group had perceived (as 
early as 1921, without the privilege of hindsight, and far more clearly than 
does Chris Goodey) that the "dictatorship of the proletariat" had been 
liquidated <i>pari passu</i> with the liquidation of the Factory Committees.</p>
