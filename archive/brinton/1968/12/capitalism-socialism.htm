<p class="fst">What is basically wrong with capitalism? Ask a number of 
socialists and you will get a number of different answers. These will depend on 
their vision of what socialism might be like and on their ideas as to what 
political action is all about. Revolutionary libertarian socialists see these 
things very differently from the trad "left". This article is not an attempt to 
counterpoise two conceptions of socialism and political action. It is an attempt 
to stress a facet of socialist thought that is in danger of being forgotten.</p>

<p class="fst">When one scratches beneath the surface, "progressive" 
capitalists, liberals, Labour reformists, "communist" macro-bureaucrats and 
Trotskyist mini-bureaucrats all see the evils of capitalism in much the same 
way. They all see them as primarily economic ills, flowing from a particular 
pattern of ownership of the means of production. When Khrushchev equated 
socialism with "more goulash for everyone" he was voicing a widespread view. 
Innumerable quotations could be found to substantiate this assertion.</p>

<p class="fst">If you don't believe that traditional socialists think in this 
way, try suggesting to one of them that modern capitalism is beginning to solve 
some economic problems. He will immediately denounce you as having "given up the 
struggle for socialism". He cannot grasp that slumps were a feature of societies 
that state capitalism had not sufficiently permeated and that they are not 
intrinsic features of capitalist society. "No economic crisis" is, for the 
traditional socialist, tantamount to "no crisis". It is synonymous with 
"capitalism has solved its problems". The traditional socialist feels insecure, 
as a socialist, if told that capitalism can solve this kind of problem, because 
for him this is <i>the</i> problem, par excellence, affecting capitalist 
society.</p>

<p class="fst">The traditional "left" today has a crude vision of man, of his 
aspirations and his needs, a vision moulded by the rotten society in which we 
live. It has a narrow concept of class consciousness. For them class 
consciousness is primarily an awareness of "non-ownership". They see the "social 
problem" being solved as the majority of the population gain access to material 
wealth. All would be well, they say or imply, if as a result of their capture of 
state power (and of their particular brand of planning) the masses could only be 
ensured a higher level of consumption. "Socialism" is equated with full bellies. 
The filling of these bellies is seen as the fundamental task of the socialist 
revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Intimately related to this concept of man as essentially a 
producing and consuming machine is the whole traditional "left" critique of 
laissez-faire capitalism. Many on the "left" continue to think we live under 
this kind of capitalism and continue to criticize it because it is inefficient 
(in the domain of production). The whole of John Strachey's writings prior to 
World War II were dominated by these conceptions. His <i>Why You Should Be a 
Socialist</i> sold nearly a million copies - and yet the ideas of freedom or 
self-management do not appear in it, as part of the socialist objective. Many of 
the leaders of today's "left" graduated at his school, including the so-called 
revolutionaries. Even the usual vision of communism, "from each according to his 
ability, to each according to his needs", usually relates, in the minds of 
"Marxists", to the division of the cake and not at all to the relations of man 
with man and between man and his environment.</p>

<p class="fst">For the traditional socialist "raising the standard of living" is 
the main purpose of social change. Capitalism allegedly cannot any longer 
develop production. (Anyone ever caught in a traffic jam, or in a working class 
shopping area on a Saturday afternoon, will find this a strange proposition.) It 
seems to be of secondary importance to this kind of socialist that under modern 
capitalism people are brutalized at work, manipulated in consumption and in 
leisure, their intellectual capacity stunted or their taste corrupted by a 
commercial culture. One must be "soft", it is implied, if one considers the 
systematic destruction of human beings to be worth a big song and dance. Those 
who talk of socialist objectives as being <i>freedom in production</i> (as well 
as out of it) are dismissed as "Utopians".</p>

<p class="fst">Were it not that misrepresentation is now an established way of 
life on the "left", it would seem unnecessary to stress that as long as millions 
of the world's population have insufficient food and clothing, the satisfaction 
of basic material needs must be an essential part of the socialist programme 
(and in fact of <i>any</i> social programme whatsoever, which does not extol the 
virtues of poverty.) The point is that by concentrating entirely on this aspect 
of the critique of capitalism the propaganda of the traditional "left" deprives 
itself of one of the most telling weapons of socialist criticism, namely an 
exposure of what capitalism does to people, particularly in countries where 
basic needs have by and large been met. And whether Guevarist or Maoist friends 
like it or not, it <i>is</i> in these countries, where there is a proletariat, that the 
socialist future of mankind will be decided.</p>

<p class="fst">This particular emphasis in the propaganda of the traditional 
organizations is not accidental. When they talk of increasing production in 
order to increase consumption, reformists and bureaucrats of one kind or another 
feel on fairly safe ground. Despite the nonsense talked by many "Marxists" about 
"stagnation of the productive forces", bureaucratic capitalism (of both the 
Eastern and Western types) <i>can</i> develop the means of production, has done 
so and is still doing so on a gigantic scale. It can provide (and 
historically has provided) a gradual increase in the standard of living - at the 
cost of intensified exploitation during the working day. It can provide a fairly 
steady level of employment. So can a well-run gaol. But on the ground of the 
subjection of man to institutions which are not of his choice, the socialist 
critiques of capitalism and bureaucratic society retain all their validity. In 
fact, their validity increases as modern society simultaneously solves the 
problem of mass poverty <i>and</i> becomes increasingly bureaucratic and 
totalitarian.</p>

<p class="fst">It will probably be objected that some offbeat trends in the 
"Marxist" movement do indulge in this wider kind of critique and in a sense this 
is true. Yet whatever the institutions criticized, their critique usually 
hinges, ultimately, on the notion of the unequal distribution of wealth. It 
consists in variations on the theme of the corrupting influence of money. When 
they talk for instance of the sexual problem or of the family, they talk of the 
economic barriers to sexual emancipation, of hunger pushing women to 
prostitution, of the poor young girl sold to the wealthy man, of the domestic 
tragedies resulting from poverty. When they denounce what capitalism does to 
culture they will do so in terms of the obstacles that economic needs puts in 
the way of talent, or they will talk of the venality of artists. All this is 
undoubtedly of great importance. But it is only the surface of the problem. 
Those socialists who can only speak in these terms see man in much less than his 
full stature. They see him as the bourgeoisie does, as a consumer (of food, of 
wealth, of culture, etc.). The essential, however, for man is to fulfil <i>
himself</i>. Socialism must give man an opportunity to create, not only in the 
economic field but in all fields of human endeavour. Let the cynics smile and 
pretend that all this is petty-bourgeois utopianism. "The problem", Marx said, 
"is to organize the world in such a manner that man experiences in it the truly 
human, becomes accustomed to experience himself as a man, to assert his true 
individuality".</p>

<p class="fst">Conflicts in class society do not simply result from inequalities 
of distribution, or flow from a given division of the surplus value, itself the 
result of a given pattern of ownership of the means of production. Exploitation 
does not <i>only</i> result in a limitation of consumption for the many and 
financial enrichment for the few. This is but one aspect of the problem. Equally 
important are the attempts by both private and bureaucratic capitalism to limit 
- and finally to suppress altogether - the <i>human</i> role of man in the 
productive process. Man is increasingly expropriated from the very management of 
his own acts. He is increasingly alienated during all his activities, whether 
individual or collective. By subjecting man to the machine - and through the 
machine to an abstract and hostile will - class society deprives man of the real 
purpose of human endeavour, which is the constant, conscious transformation of 
the world around him. That men resist this process (and that their resistance 
implicitly raises the question of self-management) is as much a driving force in 
the class struggle as the conflict over the distribution of the surplus. Marx 
doubtless had these ideas in mind when he wrote that the proletariat "regards 
its independence and sense of personal dignity as more essential than its daily 
bread".</p>

<p class="fst">Class society profoundly inhibits the natural tendency of man to 
fulfil himself in the objects of his activity. In every country of the world 
this state of affairs is experienced day after day by the working class as an 
absolute misfortune, as a permanent mutilation. It results in a constant 
struggle at the most fundamental level of production: that of conscious, willing 
participation. The producers utterly reject (and quite rightly so) a system of 
production which is imposed upon them from above and in which they are mere 
cogs. Their inventiveness, their creative ability, their ingenuity, their 
initiative may be shown in their own lives, but are certainly not shown in 
production. In the factory these aptitudes may be used, but to quite different 
and "non-productive" ends! They manifest themselves in a resistance to 
production. This results in a constant and fantastic waste compared with which 
the wastage resulting from capitalist crises or capitalist wars is really quite 
trivial!</p>

<p class="fst">Alienation in capitalist society is not simply economic. It 
manifests itself in many other ways. The conflict in production does not 
"create" or "determine" secondary conflicts in other fields. Class domination 
manifests itself in all fields, at one and the same time. Its effects could not 
otherwise be understood. Exploitation, for instance, can only occur if the 
producers are expropriated from the management of production. But this 
presupposes that they are partly expropriated at least from the capacities of 
management - in other words from culture. And this cultural expropriation in 
turn reinforces those in command of the productive machine. Similarly a society 
in which relations between people are based on domination will maintain 
authoritarian attitudes in relation to sex and to education, attitudes creating 
deep inhibitions, frustrations and much unhappiness. The conflicts engendered by 
class society take place in every one of us. A social structure containing deep 
antagonisms reproduces these antagonisms in variable degrees in each of the 
individuals comprising it.</p>

<p class="fst">There is a profound dialectical interrelationship between the 
social structure of a society and the attitudes and behaviour of its members. 
"The dominant ideas of each epoch are the ideas of its ruling class", whatever 
modern sociologists may think. Class society can only exist to the extent that it 
succeeds in imposing a widespread acceptance of its norms. From his earliest 
days man is subjected to constant pressures designed to mould his views in 
relation to work, to culture, to leisure, to thought itself. These pressures 
tend to deprive him of the natural enjoyment of his activity and even to make 
him accept this deprivation as something intrinsically good. In the past this 
job was assisted by religion. Today the same role is played by "socialist" and 
"communist" ideologies. But man is not infinitely malleable. This is why the 
bureaucratic project will come unstuck. Its objectives are in conflict with 
fundamental human aspirations.</p>

<p class="fst">We mention all this only to underline the essential identity of 
relations of domination - whether they manifest themselves in the capitalist 
factory, in the patriarchal family, in the authoritarian upbringing of children 
or in "aristocratic" cultural traditions. We also mention these facts to show 
that <i>the socialist revolution will have to take all these fields within its 
compass</i>, <i>and immediately</i>, <i>not in some far distant future</i>. The 
revolution must of course start with the overthrow of the exploiting class and 
with the institution of workers' management of production. But it will 
immediately have to tackle the reconstruction of social life in <i>all</i> its 
aspects. If it does not, it will surely die.</p>
