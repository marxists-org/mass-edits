<h2><a name="h1">Introduction</a></h2>

<p class="fst">This is an eyewitness account of two weeks spent in Paris during 
May 1968. It is what one person saw, heard or discovered during that short 
period. The account has no pretence at comprehensiveness. It has been written 
and produced in haste, its purpose being to inform rather than to analyze - and 
to inform quickly.</p>

<p class="fst">The French events have a significance that extends far beyond the 
frontiers of modern France. They will leave their mark on the history of the 
second half of the twentieth century. French bourgeois society has just been 
shaken to its foundations. Whatever the outcome of the present struggle, we must 
calmly take note of the fact that the political map of Western capitalist 
society will never be the same again. A whole epoch has just come to an end: the 
epoch during which people could say, with a semblance of verisimilitude, that 
"it couldn't happen here". Another epoch is starting: that in which people <i>
know</i> that revolution is possible under the conditions of modern bureaucratic 
capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">For Stalinism too, a whole period is ending: the period during 
which Communist Parties in Western Europe could claim (admittedly with dwindling 
credibility) that they remained revolutionary organizations, but that 
revolutionary opportunities had never really presented themselves. This notion 
has now irrevocably been swept into the proverbial "dustbin of history". When 
the chips were down, the French Communist Party and those workers under its 
influence proved to be the final and most effective "brake" on the development 
of the revolutionary self-activity of the working class.</p>

<p class="fst">A full analysis of the French events will eventually have to be 
attempted for, without an understanding of modern society, it will never be 
possible consciously to change it. But this analysis will have to wait for a 
while until some of the dust has settled. What can be said now is that, if 
honestly carried out, such an analysis will compel many "orthodox" 
revolutionaries to discard a mass of outdated slogans and myths and to reassess 
contemporary reality, particularly the reality of modern bureaucratic 
capitalism, its dynamic, its methods of control and manipulation, the reasons 
for both its resilience and its brittleness and - most important of all - the 
nature of its crises. Concepts and organizations that have been found wanting 
will have to be discarded. The new phenomena (new in themselves or new to 
traditional revolutionary theory) will have to be recognized for what they are 
and interpreted in all their implications. The <i>real</i> events of 1968 will 
then have to be integrated into a new framework of ideas, for without this <i>
development</i> of revolutionary theory, there can be no <i>development</i> of 
revolutionary practice - and in the long run no transformation of society 
through the <i>conscious</i> actions of men.</p>

<h2><a name="h2">Rue Gay-Lussac</a></h2>

<h4><a name="h3">Sunday, May 12.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The Rue Gay-Lussac still carries the scars of the "night of the 
barricades". Burnt-out cars line the pavement, their carcasses a dirty grey 
under the missing paint. The cobbles, cleared from the middle of the road, lie 
in huge mounds on either side. A vague smell of tear gas still lingers in the 
air.</p>

<p class="fst">At the junction with the Rue des Ursulines lies a building site, 
its wire-mesh fence breached in several places. From here came material for at 
least a dozen barricades: planks, wheelbarrows, metal drums, steel girders, 
cement mixers, blocks of stone. The site also yielded a pneumatic drill. The 
students couldn't use it, of course - not until a passing building worker showed 
them how, perhaps the first worker actively to support the student revolt. Once 
broken, the road surface provided cobbles, soon put to a variety of uses.</p>

<p class="fst">All that is already history.</p>

<p class="fst">People are walking up and down the street, as if trying to 
convince themselves that it really happened. They aren't students. The students 
themselves know what happened and why it happened. They aren't local inhabitants 
either. The local inhabitants saw what happened, the viciousness of the CRS<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
charges, the assaults on the wounded, the attacks on innocent bystanders, the 
unleashed fury of the state machine against those who had challenged it. The 
people in the streets are the ordinary people of Paris, people from neighbouring 
districts, horrified at what they have heard over the radio or read in their 
papers and who have come for a walk on a fine Sunday morning to see for 
themselves. They are talking in small clusters with the inhabitants of the Rue 
Gay-Lussac. The Revolution, having for a week held the university and the 
streets of the Latin Quarter, is beginning to take hold of the minds of men.</p>

<p class="fst">On Friday, May 3rd, the CRS had paid their historic visit to the 
Sorbonne. They had been invited in by Paul Roche, Rector of Paris University. 
The Rector had almost certainly acted in connivance with Alain Peyrefitte, 
Minister of Education, if not with the Elysee itself. Many students had been 
arrested, beaten up, and several were summarily convicted.</p>

<p class="fst">The unbelievable - yet thoroughly predictable - ineptitude of 
this bureaucratic "solution" to the "problem" of student discontent triggered 
off a chain reaction. It provided the pent-up anger, resentment and frustration 
of tens of thousands of young people with both a reason for further action and 
with an attainable objective. The students, evicted from the university, took to 
the street, demanding the liberation of their comrades, the reopening of their 
faculties, the withdrawal of the cops.</p>

<p class="fst">Layer upon layer of new people were soon drawn into the struggle. 
The student union (UNEF) and the union representing university teaching staff 
(SNESup) called for an unlimited strike. For a week the students held their 
ground, in ever bigger and more militant street demonstrations. On Tuesday, May 
7, 50,000 students and teachers marched through the streets behind a single 
banner, "<i>Vive La Commune</i>", and sang the <i>Internationale</i> at the Tomb 
of the Unknown Soldier, at the Arc de Triomphe. On Friday, May 10, students and 
teachers decided to occupy the Latin Quarter en masse. They felt they had more 
right to be there than the police, for whom barracks were provided elsewhere. 
The cohesion and sense of purpose of the demonstrators terrified the 
Establishment. Power couldn't be allowed to lie with this rabble, who had even 
had the audacity to erect barricades.</p>

<p class="fst">Another inept gesture was needed. Another administrative reflex 
duly materialized. Fouchet (Minister of the Interior) and Joxe (Deputy Prime 
Minister) ordered Grimaud (Superintendent of the Paris police) to clear the 
streets. The order was confirmed in writing, doubtless to be preserved for 
posterity as an example of what not to do in certain situations. The CRS charged 
... clearing the Rue Gay-Lussac and opening the doors to the second phase of the 
Revolution.</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<p class="fst">In the Rue Gay-Lussac and in adjoining streets, the 
battle-scarred walls carry a dual message. They bear testimony to the incredible 
courage of those who held the area for several hours against a deluge of tear 
gas, phosphorous grenades and repeated charges of club-swinging CRS. But they 
also show something of what the defenders were striving for ...</p>

<p class="fst">Mural propaganda is an integral part of the revolutionary Paris 
of May 1968. It has become a mass activity, part and parcel of the Revolution's 
method of self-expression. The walls of the Latin Quarter are the depository of 
a new rationality, no longer confined to books, but democratically displayed at 
street level and made available to all. The trivial and the profound, the 
traditional and the esoteric, rub shoulders in this new fraternity, rapidly 
breaking down the rigid barriers and compartments in people's minds. "<i>Désobéir 
d'abord</i>: <i>alors écris sur les murs</i> (<i>Loi du 10 Mai 1968</i>)" reads 
an obviously recent inscription, clearly setting the tone. "<i>Si tout le peuple 
faisait comme nous</i>" (If everybody acted like us ...) wistfully dreams 
another in joyful anticipation, I think, rather than in any spirit of 
self-satisfied substitutionism. Most of the slogans are straightforward, correct 
and fairly orthodox: "<i>Libérez nos camarades</i>"; "<i>Fouchet, Grimaud, 
demission</i>"; "<i>A bas L'Etat policier</i>"; "<i>Grève Générale Lundi</i>"; "<i>Travailleurs, 
Etudiants, solidaires</i>"; "<i>Vive les Conseils Ouvriers</i>". Other slogans 
reflect the new concerns: "<i>La Publicité te manipule</i>"; "<i>Examens = 
Hiérarchie</i>"; "<i>L'art est mort, ne consommez pas son cadaver</i>"; "<i>A 
bas la société de consommation</i>"; "<i>Debout les damnés de Nanterre</i>". The 
slogan, "<i>Baisses-toi et broute</i>" (Bend your head and chew the cud), was 
obviously aimed at those whose minds are still full of traditional 
preoccupations.</p>

<p class="fst">"<i>Contre la fermentation groupusculaire</i>" moans a large 
scarlet inscription. This one is really out of touch. For everywhere there is a 
profusion of pasted-up posters and journals: <i>Voix Ouvrière, Avant-Garde</i> 
and <i>Révoltes</i> (for the Trotskyists), <i>Servir le Peuple</i> and <i>
Humanité Nouvelle</i> (for the devotees of Chairman Mao), <i>Le Libertaire</i> 
(for the Anarchists), <i>Tribune Socialiste</i> (for the PSU).<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
Even odd copies of <i>L'Humanité</i> are pasted up. It is difficult to read 
them, so covered are they with critical comments.</p>

<p class="fst">On a hoarding, I see a large advertisement for a new brand of 
cheese: a child biting into an enormous sandwich. "<i>C'est bon le fromage</i> 
So-and-So" runs the patter. Someone has covered the last few words with red 
paint. The poster reads "<i>C'est bon la Révolution</i>". People pass by, look, 
and smile.</p>

<p class="sub">***</p>

<p class="fst">I talk to my companion, a man of about 45, an "old" 
revolutionary. We discuss the tremendous possibilities now opening up. He 
suddenly turns towards me and comes out with a memorable phrase: "To think one 
had to have kids and wait twenty years to see all this ..." We talk to others in 
the street, to young and old, to the "political" and the "unpolitical", to 
people at all levels of understanding and commitment. Everyone is prepared to 
talk - in fact everyone wants to. They all seem remarkably articulate. We find 
no one prepared to defend the actions of the administration. The "critics" fall 
into two main groups.</p>

<p class="fst">The "progressive" university teachers, the Communists, and a 
number of students see the main root of the student "crisis" in the backwardness 
of the university in relation to society's current needs, in the quantitative 
inadequacy of the tuition provided, in the semi-feudal attitudes of some 
professors, and in the general insufficiency of job opportunities. They see the 
university as unadapted to the modern world. The remedy for them is adaptation: 
a modernizing reform which would sweep away the cobwebs, provide more teachers, 
better lecture theatres, a bigger educational budget, perhaps a more liberal 
attitude on the campus and, at the end of it all, an assured job.</p>

<p class="fst">The rebels (which include some but by no means all of the "old" 
revolutionaries) see this concern with adapting the university to modern society 
as something of a diversion. For it is modern society itself which they reject. 
They consider bourgeois life trivial and mediocre, repressive and repressed. 
They have no yearning (but only contempt) for the administrative and managerial 
careers it holds out for them. They are not seeking integration into adult 
society. On the contrary, they are seeking a chance radically to contest its 
adulteration. The driving force of their revolt is their own alienation, the 
meaninglessness of life under modern bureaucratic capitalism. It is certainly 
not a purely economic deterioration in their standard of living.</p>

<p class="fst">It is no accident that the "revolution" started in the Nanterre 
faculties of Sociology and Psychology. The students saw that the sociology they 
were being taught was a means of controlling and manipulating society, not a 
means of understanding it in order to change it. In the process they discovered 
revolutionary sociology. They rejected the niche allocated to them in the great 
bureaucratic pyramid, that of "experts" in the service of a technocratic 
Establishment, specialists of the "human factor" in the modern industrial 
equation. In the process they discovered the importance of the working class. 
The amazing thing is that, at least among the active layers of the students, 
these "sectarians" suddenly seem to have become the majority: surely the best 
definition of any revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The two types of "criticism" of the modern French educational 
system do not neutralize one another. On the contrary, each creates its own kind 
of problems for the university authorities and for the officials at the Ministry 
of Education. The real point is that one kind of criticism - what one might call 
the quantitative one - could in time be coped with by modern bourgeois society. 
The other - the qualitative one - never. This is what gives it its revolutionary 
potential. The "trouble with the university", for the powers that be, isn't that 
money can't be found for more teachers. It can. The "trouble" is that the 
university is full of students - and that the heads of the students are full of 
revolutionary ideas.</p>

<p class="fst">Among those we speak to there is a deep awareness that the 
problem cannot be solved in the Latin Quarter, that isolation of the revolt in a 
student "ghetto" (even an "autonomous" one) would spell defeat. They realize 
that the salvation of the movement lies in its extension to other sectors of the 
population. But here wide differences appear. When some talk of the importance 
of the working class it is as a substitute for getting on with any kind of 
struggle themselves, an excuse for denigrating the students' struggle as 
"adventurist". Yet it is precisely because of its unparalleled militancy that 
the students' action has established that direct action works, has begun to 
influence the younger workers and to rattle the established organizations. Other 
students realize the relationship of these struggles more clearly. We will find 
them later at Censier, animating the "worker-student" Action Committees. But 
enough, for the time being, about the Latin Quarter. The movement has already 
spread beyond its narrow confines.</p>

<h2><a name="h4">May 13: From Renault to the Streets of Paris</a></h2>

<h4><a name="h5">Monday, May 13. 6.15 am, Avenue Yves Kermen.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">A clear, cloudless day. Crowds begin to gather outside the gates 
of the giant Renault works at Boulogne-Billancourt. The main trade union <i>
centrales</i> (CGT, CFDT and FO) have called a one-day general strike. They are 
protesting against police violence in the Latin Quarter and in support of 
long-neglected claims concerning wages, hours, the age of retirement and 
trade-union rights in the plants.</p>

<p class="fst">The factory gates are wide open. Not a cop or supervisor in 
sight. The workers stream in. A loud-hailer tells them to proceed to their 
respective shops, to refuse to start work and to proceed, at 8.00 am, to their 
traditional meeting place, an enormous shed-like structure in the middle of the 
Ile Seguin (an island in the Seine entirely covered by parts of the Renault 
plant).</p>

<p class="fst">As each worker goes through the gates, the pickets give him a 
leaflet, jointly produced by the three unions. Leaflets in Spanish are also 
distributed (over 2,000 Spanish workers are employed at Renault). French and 
Spanish orators succeed one another, in short spells, at the microphone. 
Although all the unions are supporting the one-day strike, all the orators seem 
to belong to the CGT.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> It's their 
loudspeaker ...</p>

<h4><a name="h6">6.45 am.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Hundreds of workers are now streaming in. Many look as if they 
had come to work rather than to participate in mass meetings at the plant. The 
decision to call the strike was only taken on the Saturday afternoon, after many 
of the men had already dispersed for the weekend. Many seem unaware of what it's 
all about. I am struck by the number of Algerian and black workers. There are 
only a few posters at the gate, again mainly those of the CGT. Some pickets 
carry CFDT<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> posters. There isn't 
an FO<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> poster in sight. The road 
and walls outside the factory have been well covered with slogans: "One-day 
strike on Monday"; "Unity in defence of our claims"; "No to the monopolies".</p>

<p class="fst">The little cafe near the gates is packed. People seem unusually 
wide-awake and communicative for so early an hour. A newspaper kiosk is selling 
about three copies of <i>L'Humanité</i> for every copy of anything else. The 
local branch of the Communist Party is distributing a leaflet calling for 
"resolution, calm, vigilance and unity" and warning against "provocateurs".</p>

<p class="fst">The pickets make no attempt to argue with those pouring in. No 
one seems to know whether they will obey the strike call or not. Less than 25 
per cent of Renault workers belong to any union at all. This is the biggest car 
factory in Europe.</p>

<p class="fst">The loudhailer hammers home its message: "The CRS have recently 
assaulted peasants at Quimper, and workers at Caen, Rhodiaceta (Lyon) and 
Dassault. Now they are turning on the students. The regime will not tolerate 
opposition. It will not modernize the country. It will not grant us our basic 
wage demands. Our one-day strike will show both Government and employers our 
determination. We must compel them to retreat." The message is repeated again 
and again, like a gramophone record. I wonder whether the speaker believes what 
he says, whether he even senses what lies ahead.</p>

<h5><a name="h7">Text of CGT Poster, Placarded All over Boulogne-Billancourt</a></h5>

<p class="quoteb">WORKERS BEWARE! For some months the most diverse publications 
have been distributed by elements recruited in a milieu foreign to the working 
class.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The authors of these articles remain anonymous most of the 
time, a fact which fully illustrates their dishonesty. They give the most weird 
and tempting titles to their papers, the better to mislead: <i>Luttes Ouvrières</i>; <i>
Servir le Peuple</i>; <i>Unité et Travail</i><a href="#r1" name="rn1" target="_self">[1*]</a>; <i>
Lutte Communiste</i>; <i>
Révoltes</i>; <i>Voix Ouvrière</i>; <i>Un Group d'Ouvriers</i>.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The titles may vary but the content has a common objective: to 
lead the workers away from the CGT and to provoke divisions in their ranks, in 
order to weaken them.</p>

<p class="quoteb">At night, their commandos tear up our posters. Every time they 
distribute something at the gates, the police is not far off, ready to protect 
their distribution, as was the case recently at LMT Recently they attempted to 
invade the offices of the Labour Exchange at Boulogne. Their activities are 
given an exaggerated publicity on the Gaullist radio and in the columns of the 
bourgeois press.</p>

<p class="quoteb">This warning is no doubt superfluous for the majority of 
Renault workers, who, in the past, have got to know about this kind of 
agitation. On the other hand the younger workers must be told that these 
elements are in the service of the bourgeoisie, who has always made use of these 
pseudo-revolutionaries whenever the rise of united left forces has presented a 
threat to its privileges. It is therefore important not to allow these people to 
come to the gates of our factory, to sully our tradeunion organization and our 
CGT militants, who are tirelessly exerting themselves in defence of our demands 
and to bring about unity. These elements always reap a fat reward at the end of 
the day for their dirty work, and for the loyal services given to the bosses 
(some now occupy high positions in the mangagement of the factory).</p>

<p class="quoteb">This having been said, the CGT (Renault) Committee calls on 
the workers to continue the fight for their demands, to intensify their efforts 
to ensure greater unity of the trade union and democratic forces, and to 
strengthen the ranks of the CGT struggling for these noble objectives.</p>

<p class="quotec">The Trade Union Bureau, CGT, Renault.</p>

<p class="fst">At 7.00 am a dozen Trotskyists of the FER (Fédération des 
Etudiants Révolutionaires) turn up to sell their paper <i>Révoltes</i>. They 
wear large red and white buttons proclaiming their identity. A little later 
another group arrives to sell <i>Voix Ouvrière</i>. The loudspeaker immediately 
switches from an attack on the Gaullist government and its CRS to an attack on 
"provocateurs" and "disruptive elements, alien to the working class". The 
Stalinist speaker hints that the sellers are in the pay of the government. As 
they are here, "the police must be lurking in the neighbourhood". Heated 
arguments break out between sellers and CGT officials. The CFDT pickets are 
refused the use of the loudhailer. They shout "<i>démocratic ouvrière</i>" and 
defend the right of the "disruptive elements" to sell their stuff. A rather 
abstract right, as not a sheet is sold. The front page of <i>Revoltés</i> 
carries an esoteric article on Eastern Europe.</p>

<p class="fst">Much invective (but no blows) is exchanged. In the course of an 
argument I hear Bro. Trigon (delegate to the second electoral "college" at 
Renault) describe Danny Cohn-Bendit as "<i>un agent du pouvoir</i>" (an agent of 
the authorities). A student takes him up on this point. The Trots don't. Shortly 
before 8.00 am they walk off, their "act of presence" accomplished and duly 
recorded for history.</p>

<p class="fst">At about the same time, hundreds of workers who had entered the 
factory leave their shops and assemble in the sunshine in an open space a few 
hundred yards inside the main gate. From there they amble towards Ile Seguin, 
crossing one arm of the River Seine on the way. Other processions leave other 
points of the factory and converge on the same area. The metallic ceiling is 
nearly 200 feet above our heads. Enormous stocks of components are piled up 
right and left. Far away to the right an assembly line is still working, lifting 
what looks like rear car seats, complete with attached springs, from the ground 
to first floor level.</p>

<p class="fst">Some 10,000 workers are soon assembled in the shed. The orators 
address them through a loudspeaker from a narrow platform some forty feet up. 
The platform runs in front of what looks like an elevated inspection post but 
which I am told is a union office inside the factory.</p>

<p class="fst">The CGT speaker deals with various sectional wage claims. He 
denounces the resistance of the government "in the hands of the monopolies". He 
produces facts and figures dealing with the wage structure. Many highly skilled 
men are not getting enough. A CFDT speaker follows him. He deals with the steady 
speed-up, with the worsening of working conditions, with accidents and with the 
fate of man in production. "What kind of life is this? Are we always to remain 
puppets, carrying out every whim of the management?" He advocates uniform wage 
increases for all (<i>augmentations non-hiérarchisées</i>). An FO speaker 
follows. He is technically the most competent, but says the least. In flowery 
rhetoric he talks of 1936, but omits all reference to Léon Blum. The record of 
FO is bad in the factory and the speaker is heckled from time to time. The CGT 
speakers then ask the workers to participate en masse in the big rally planned 
for that afternoon. As the last speaker finishes, the crowd spontaneously breaks 
out into a rousing <i>Internationale</i>. The older men seem to know most of the 
words. The younger workers only know the chorus. A friend nearby assures me that 
in twenty years this is the first time he has heard the song sung inside Renault 
(he has attended dozens of mass meetings in the Ile Seguin). There is an 
atmosphere of excitement, particularly among the younger workers.</p>

<p class="fst">The crowd then breaks up into several sections. Some walk back 
over the bridge and out of the factory. Others proceed systematically through 
the shops where a few hundred blokes are still at work. Some of these men argue 
but most seem only too glad for an excuse to stop and join in the procession. 
Gangs weave their way, joking and singing, amid the giant presses and tanks. 
Those remaining at work are ironically cheered, clapped or exhaled to "step on 
it" or "work harder". Occasional foremen look on helplessly, as one assembly 
line after another is brought to a halt.</p>

<p class="fst">Many of the lathes have coloured pictures plastered over them: 
pin-ups and green fields, sex and sunshine. Anyone still working is exhorted to 
get out into the daylight, not just to dream about it. In the main plant, over 
half a mile long, hardly twelve men remain in their overalls. Not an angry voice 
can be heard. There is much good-humoured banter. By 11.00 am thousands of 
workers have poured out into the warmth of a morning in May. An open-air beer 
and sandwich stall, outside the gate is doing a roaring trade.</p>

<h4><a name="h8">Monday, May 13, 1.15 pm.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The streets are crowded. The response to the call for a 24-hour 
general strike has exceeded the wildest hopes of the trade unions. Despite the 
short notice Paris is paralyzed. The strike was only decided 48 hours ago, after 
the "night of the barricades". It is moreover "illegal". The law of the land 
demands a five-day notice before an "official" strike can be called. Too bad for 
legality. A solid phalanx of young people is walking up the Boulevard de 
Sébastopol, towards the Care de l'Est. They are proceeding to the student 
rallying point for the giant demonstration called jointly by the unions, the 
students' organization (UNEF) and the teachers' associations (FEN and SNESup).</p>

<p class="fst">There is not a bus or car in sight. The streets of Paris today 
belong to the demonstrators. Thousands of them are already in the square in 
front of the station. Thousands more are moving in from every direction. The 
plan agreed by the sponsoring organizations is for the different categories to 
assemble separately and then to converge on the Place de la République, from 
where the march will proceed across Paris, via the Latin Quarter: to the Place 
Denfert-Rochereau. We are already packed like sardines for as far as the eye can 
see, yet there is more than an hour to go before we are due to proceed. The sun 
has been shining all day. The girls are in summer dresses, the young men in 
shirtsleeves. A red flag is flying over the railway station. There are many red 
flags in the crowd and several black ones too.</p>

<p class="fst">A man suddenly appears carrying a suitcase full of duplicated 
leaflets. He belongs to some left <i>groupuscule</i> or other. He opens his 
suitcase and distributes perhaps a dozen leaflets. But he doesn't have to 
continue alone. There is an unquenchable thirst for information, ideas, 
literature, argument, polemic. The man just stands there as people surround him 
and press forward to get the leaflets. Dozens of demonstrators, without even 
reading the leaflet, help him distribute them. Some 6,000 copies get out in a 
few minutes. All seem to be assiduously read. People argue, laugh, joke. I 
witnessed such scenes again and again.</p>

<p class="fst">Sellers of revolutionary literature are doing well. An edict, 
signed by the organizers of the demonstration, that "the only literature allowed 
would be that of the organizations sponsoring the demonstration" (<i>L'Humanité</i>, 
13 May 1968) is being enthusiastically flouted. This bureaucratic restriction 
(much criticized the previous evening when announced at Censier by the student 
delegates to the Coordinating Committee) obviously cannot be enforced in a crowd 
of this size. The Revolution is bigger than any organization, more tolerant than 
any institution "representing" the masses, more realistic than any edict of any 
Central Committee.</p>

<p class="fst">Demonstrators have climbed on to walls, on to the roofs of bus 
stops, on to the railings in front of the station. Some have loudhailers and 
make short speeches. All the "politicos" seem to be in one part or other of this 
crowd. I can see the banner of the Jeunesse Communiste Révolutionnaire, 
portraits of Castro and Che Guevara, the banner of the FER, several banners of 
Servir le Peuple (a Maoist group) and the banner of the UJCML (Union de la 
Jeunesse Communiste Marxiste-Léniniste), another Maoist tendency. There are also 
banners from many educational establishments now occupied by those who work 
there. Large groups of <i>lycéens</i> (high school kids) mingle with the 
students as do many thousands of teachers.</p>

<p class="fst">At about 2.00 pm the student section sets off, singing the <i>
Internationale</i>. We march twenty to thirty abreast, arms linked. There is a 
row of red flags in front of us, then a banner fifty feet wide carrying four 
simple words: "<i>Etudiants</i>, <i>Enseignants</i>, <i>Travailleurs</i>, <i>
Solidaires</i>". It is an impressive sight.</p>

<p class="fst">The whole Boulevard de Magenta is a solid seething mass of 
humanity. We can't enter the Place de la Republique, already packed full of 
demonstrators. One can't even move along the pavements or through adjacent 
streets. Nothing but people, as far as the eye can see.</p>

<p class="fst">As we proceed slowly down the Boulevard de Magenta, we notice on 
a third-floor balcony, high on our right, an SFIO (Socialist Party) 
headquarters. The balcony is bedecked with a few decrepit-looking red flags and 
a banner proclaiming "Solidarity with the Students". A few elderly characters 
wave at us, somewhat selfconsciously. Someone in the crowd starts chanting "<i>O-por-tu-nistes</i>". 
The slogan is taken up, rhythmically roared by thousands, to the discomfiture of 
those on the balcony who beat a hasty retreat. The people have not forgotten the 
use of the CRS against the striking miners in 1958 by "socialist" Minister of 
the Interior Jules Moch. They remember the "socialist" Prime Minister Guy Mollet 
and his role during the Algerian War. Mercilessly, the crowd shows its contempt 
for the discredited politicians now seeking to jump on the bandwagon. "<i>Guy 
Mollet</i>, <i>au musée</i>", they shout, amid laughter. It is truly the end of 
an epoch.</p>

<p class="fst">At about 3.00 pm we at last reach the Place de la Republique, our 
point of departure. The crowd here is so dense that several people faint and 
have to be carried into neighbouring cafes. Here people are packed almost as 
tight as in the street, but can at least avoid being injured. The window of one 
cafe gives way under the pressure of the crowd outside. There is a genuine fear, 
in several parts of the crowd, of being crushed to death. The first union 
contingents fortunately begin to leave the square. There isn't a policeman in 
sight.</p>

<p class="fst">Although the demonstration has been announced as a joint one, the 
CGT leaders are still striving desperately to avoid a mixing-up, on the streets, 
of students and workers. In this they are moderately successful. By about 4.30 
pm the students' and teachers' contingent, perhaps 80,000 strong, finally leaves 
the Place de la Republique. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have preceded 
it, hundreds of thousands follow it, but the "left" contingent has been well and 
truly "bottled-in". Several groups, understanding at last the CGT's manoeuvre, 
break loose once we are out of the square. They take short cuts via various side 
streets, at the double, and succeed in infiltrating groups of a hundred or so 
into parts of the march ahead of them or behind them. The Stalinist stewards 
walking hand in hand and hemming the march in on either side are powerless to 
prevent these sudden influxes. The student demonstrators scatter like fish in 
water as soon as they have entered a given contingent. The CGT marchers 
themselves are quite friendly and readily assimilate the newcomers, not quite 
sure what it's all about. The students' appearance, dress and speech do not 
enable them to be identified as readily as they would be in Britain.</p>

<p class="fst">The main student contingent proceeds as a compact body. Now that 
we are past the bottleneck of the Place de la République the pace is quite 
rapid. The student group nevertheless takes at least half an hour to pass a 
given point. The slogans of the students contrast strikingly with those of the 
CGT. The students shout "<i>Le Pouvoir aux Owners</i>" (All Power to the 
Workers); "<i>Le Pouvoir est dans la rue</i>" (Power lies in the street); "<i>Libérez 
nos camarades</i>". CGT members shout "<i>Pompidou</i>, <i>démission</i>" 
(Pompidou, resign). The students chant "<i>De Gaulle</i>, <i>assassin</i>", or "<i>CRS-SS</i>". 
The CGT: "<i>Des sous</i>, <i>pas de matraques</i>" (Money, not police clubs) or 
"<i>Défense du pouvoir d'achat</i>" (Defend our purchasing power). The students 
say "<i>Non à l'Université de classe</i>". The CGT and the Stalinist students, 
grouped around the banner of their paper <i>Clarte</i> reply "<i>Université 
Démocratique</i>". Deep political differences lie behind the differences of 
emphasis. Some slogans are taken up by everyone, slogans such as "<i>Dix ans</i>, <i>
c'est assez</i>", "<i>A bas l'Etat policier</i>", or "<i>Bon anniversaire</i>, <i>
mon Général</i>". Whole groups mournfully intone a well-known refrain: "<i>Adieu</i>, <i>
de Gaulle</i>". They wave their handkerchiefs, to the great merriment of the 
bystanders.</p>

<p class="fst">As the main student contingent crosses the Pont St.-Michel to 
enter the Latin Quarter it suddenly stops, in silent tribute to its wounded. All 
thoughts are for a moment switched to those lying in hospital, their sight in 
danger through too much tear gas or their skulls or ribs fractured by the 
truncheons of the CRS. The sudden, angry silence of this noisiest part of the 
demonstration conveys a deep impression of strength and resolution. One senses 
massive accounts yet to be settled.</p>

<p class="fst">At the top of the Boulevard St.-Michel I drop out of the march, 
climb on to a parapet lining the Luxembourg Gardens, and just watch. I remain 
there for two hours as row after row of demonstrators marches past, thirty or 
more abreast, a human tidal wave of fantastic, inconceivable size. How many are 
they? 600,000? 800,000? A million? 1,500,000? No one can really number them. The 
first of the demonstrators reached the final dispersal point hours before the 
last ranks had left the Place de la République, at 7.00 pm.</p>

<p class="fst">There were banners of every kind: union banners, student banners, 
political banners, non-political banners, reformist banners, revolutionary 
banners, banners of the Mouvement contre Armement Atomique, banners of various 
Conseils de Parents d'Elèves, banners of every conceivable size and shape, 
proclaiming a common abhorrence at what had happened and a common will to 
struggle on. Some banners were notedly applauded, such as the one saying "<i>Libérons 
l'information</i>" (Let's have a free news service) carried by a group of 
employees from the ORTF. Some banners indulged in vivid symbolism, such as the 
gruesome one carried by a group of artists, depicting human hands, heads and 
eyes, each with its price tag, on display on the hooks and trays of a butcher's 
shop.</p>

<p class="fst">Endlessly they filed past. There were whole sections of hospital 
personnel, in white coats, some carrying posters saying "<i>Où sont les disparus 
des hopitaux?</i>" (Where are the missing injured?). Every factory, every major 
workplace seemed to be represented. There were numerous groups of railwaymen, 
postmen, printers, Metro personnel, metal workers, airport workers, market men, 
electricians, lawyers, sewer-men, bank employees, building workers, glass and 
chemical workers, waiters, municipal employees, painters and decorators, gas 
workers, shop girls, insurance clerks, road sweepers, film studio operators, 
busmen, teachers, workers from the new plastic industries, row upon row upon row 
of them, the flesh and blood of modern capitalist society, an unending mass, a 
power that could sweep <i>everything</i> before it, if it but decided to do so.</p>

<p class="fst">My thoughts went to those who say that the workers are only 
interested in football, in the <i>tiercé</i> (horse-betting), in watching the 
telly, in their annual <i>congés</i> (holidays), and that the working class 
cannot see beyond the problems of its everyday life. It was so palpably untrue. 
I also thought of those who say that only a narrow and rotten leadership lies 
between the masses and the total transformation of society. It was equally 
untrue. Today the working class is becoming conscious of its strength. Will it 
decide, tomorrow, to use it?</p>

<p class="fst">I rejoin the march and we proceed towards Denfert-Rochereau. We 
pass several statues, sedate gentlemen now bedecked with red flags or carrying 
slogans such as "<i>Libérez nos camarades</i>". As we pass a hospital silence 
again descends on the endless crowd. Someone starts whistling the <i>
Internationale</i>. Others take it up. Like a breeze rustling over an enormous 
field of corn, the whistled tune ripples out in all directions. From the windows 
of the hospital some nurses wave at us.</p>

<p class="fst">At various intersections we pass traffic lights which by some 
strange inertia still seem to be working. Red and green alternate, at fixed 
intervals, meaning as little as bourgeois education, as work in modern society, 
as the lives of those walking past. The reality of today, for a few hours, has 
submerged all of yesterday's patterns.</p>

<p class="fst">The part of the march in which I find myself is now rapidly 
approaching what the organizers have decided should be the dispersal point. The 
CGT is desperately keen that its hundreds of thousands of supporters should 
disperse quietly. It fears them, when they are together. It wants them nameless 
atoms again, scattered to the four corners of Paris, powerless in the context of 
their individual preoccupations. The CGT sees itself as the only possible link 
between them, as the divinely ordained vehicle for the expression of their 
collective will. The Mouvement du 22 Mars, on the other hand, had issued a call 
to the students and workers, asking them to stick together and to proceed to the 
lawns of the Champ de Mars (at the foot of the Eiffel Tower) for a massive 
collective discussion on the experiences of the day and on the problems that lie 
ahead.</p>

<p class="fst">At this stage I sample for the first time what a <i>service 
d'ordre</i> composed of Stalinist stewards really means. All day, the stewards 
have obviously been anticipating this particular moment. They are very tense, 
clearly expecting "trouble". Above all else they fear what they call <i>
débordement</i>, i.e. being outflanked on the left. For the last half-mile of 
the march five or six solid rows of them line up on either side of the 
demonstrators. Arms linked, they form a massive sheath around the marchers. CGT 
officials address the bottled-up demonstrators through two powerful loudspeakers 
mounted on vans, instructing them to disperse quietly via the Boulevard Arago, 
i.e. to proceed in precisely the opposite direction to the one leading to the 
Champ de Mars. Other exits from the Place Denfert-Rochereau are blocked by lines 
of stewards linking arms.</p>

<p class="fst">On occasions like this, I am told, the Communist Party calls up 
thousands of its members from the Paris area. It also summons members from miles 
around, bringing them up by the coachload from places as far away as Rennes, 
Orléans, Sens, Lille and Limoges. The municipalities under Communist Party 
control provide further hundreds of these "stewards", not necessarily Party 
members but people dependent on the goodwill of the Party for their jobs and 
future. Ever since its heyday of participation in the government (1945-47) the 
Party has had this kind of mass base in the Paris suburbs. It has invariably 
used it in circumstances like today. On this demonstration there must be at 
least 10,000 such stewards, possibly twice that number.</p>

<p class="fst">The exhortations of the stewards meet with a variable response. 
Whether they are successful in getting particular groups to disperse via the 
Boulevard Arago depends of course on the composition of the groups. Most of 
those which the students have not succeeded in infiltrating obey, although even 
here some of the younger militants protest: "We are a million in the streets. 
Why should we go home?" Other groups hesitate, vacillate, start arguing. Student 
speakers climb on walls and shout: "All those who want to return to the telly, 
turn down the Boulevard Arago. Those who are for joint worker-student 
discussions and for developing the struggle, turn down the Boulevard Raspail and 
proceed to the Champ de Mars".</p>

<p class="fst">Those protesting against the dispersion orders are immediately 
jumped on by the stewards, denounced as "provocateurs" and often manhandled. I 
saw several comrades of the Mouvement du 22 Mars physically assaulted, their 
portable loud-hailers snatched from their hands and their leaflets torn from 
them and thrown to the ground. In some sections there seemed to be dozens, in 
others hundreds, in others thousands of "provocateurs". A number of minor 
punch-ups take place as the stewards are swept aside by these particular 
contingents. Heated arguments break out, the demonstrators denouncing the 
Stalinists as "cops" and as "the last rampart of the bourgeoisie".</p>

<p class="fst">A respect for facts compels me to admit that most contingents 
followed the orders of the trade-union bureaucrats. The repeated slanders by the 
CGT and Communist Party leaders had had their effect. The students were 
"trouble-makers", "adventurers", "dubious elements". Their proposed action would 
only lead to a massive intervention by the CRS (who had kept well out of sight 
throughout the whole of the afternoon). "This was just a demonstration, not a 
prelude to Revolution". Playing ruthlessly on the most backward sections of the 
crowd, and physically assaulting the more advanced sections, the apparatchiks of 
the CGT succeeded in getting the bulk of the demonstrators to disperse, often 
under protest. Thousands went to the Champ de Mars. But hundreds of thousands 
went home. The Stalinists won the day, but the arguments started will surely 
reverberate down the months to come.</p>

<p class="fst">At about 8.00 pm an episode took place which changed the temper 
of the last sections of the march, now approaching the dispersal point. A police 
van suddenly came up one of the streets leading into the Place 
Denfert-Rochereau. It must have strayed from its intended route, or perhaps its 
driver had assumed that the demonstrators had already dispersed. Seeing the 
crowd ahead the two uniformed gendarmes in the front seat panicked. Unable to 
reverse in time in order to retreat, the driver decided that his life hinged on 
forcing a passage through the thinnest section of the crowd. The vehicle 
accelerated, hurling itself into the demonstrators at about fifty miles an hour. 
People scattered wildly in all directions. Several people were knocked down and 
two were seriously injured. Many more narrowly escaped. The van was finally 
surrounded. One of the policemen in the front seat was dragged out and 
repeatedly punched by the infuriated crowd, determined to lynch him. He was 
finally rescued in the nick of time, by the stewards. They more or less carried 
him, semi-conscious, down a side street where he was passed horizontally, like a 
battered blood sausage, through an open ground-floor window.</p>

<p class="fst">To do this, the stewards had had to engage in a running fight 
with several hundred very angry marchers. The crowd then started rocking the 
stranded police van. The remaining policeman drew his revolver and fired. People 
ducked. By a miracle no one was hit. A hundred yards away the bullet made a 
hole, about three feet above ground level, in a window of Le Belfort, a big cafe 
at 297 Boulevard Raspail. The stewards again rushed to the rescue, forming a 
barrier between the crowd and the police van, which was allowed to escape down a 
side street, driven by the policeman who had fired at the crowd.</p>

<p class="fst">Hundreds of demonstrators then thronged round the hole in the 
window of the cafe. Press photographers were summoned, arrived, duly took their 
close-ups - none of which, of course, were ever published. (Two days later <i>
L'Humanité</i> carried a few lines about the episode, at the bottom of a column 
on page 5.) One effect of the episode is that several thousand more 
demonstrators decided not to disperse. They turned and marched down towards the 
Champ de Mars, shouting "<i>Ils ont tiré à Denfert</i>" (They've shot at us at 
Denfert). If the incident had taken place an hour earlier, the evening of 13 May 
might have had a very different complexion.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<h2><a name="h9">The Sorbonne "Soviet"</a></h2>

<p class="fst">On Saturday, May 11, shortly before midnight, M. Pompidou, Prime 
Minister of France, overruled his Minister of the Interior, his Minister of 
Education, and issued orders to his "independent" judiciary. He announced that 
the police would be withdrawn from the Latin Quarter, that the faculties would 
reopen on Monday, May 13, and that the law would "reconsider" the question of 
the students arrested the previous week. It was the biggest political climb-down 
of his career. For the students, and for many others, it was the living proof 
that direct action worked. Concessions had been won through struggle which had 
been unobtainable by other means.</p>

<p class="fst">Early on the Monday morning the CRS platoons guarding the 
entrance to the Sorbonne were discreetly withdrawn. The students moved in, first 
in small groups, then in hundreds, later in thousands. By midday the occupation 
was complete. Every <i>tricolore</i> was promptly hauled down, every lecture 
theatre occupied. Red flags were hoisted from the official flagpoles and from 
improvised ones at many windows, some overlooking the streets, others the big 
internal courtyard. Hundreds of feet above the milling students, enormous red 
and black flags fluttered side by side from the chapel dome.</p>

<p class="fst">What happened over the next few days will leave a permanent mark 
on the French educational system, on the structure of French society and - most 
important of all - on the minds of those who lived and made history during that 
hectic first fortnight. The Sorbonne was suddenly transformed from the fusty 
precinct where French capitalism selected and moulded its hierarchs, its 
technocrats and its administrative bureaucracy into a revolutionary volcano in 
full eruption whose lava was to spread far and wide, searing the social 
structure of modern France.</p>

<p class="fst">The physical occupation of the Sorbonne was followed by an 
intellectual explosion of unprecedented violence. Everything, literally 
everything, was suddenly and simultaneously up for discussion, for question, for 
challenge. There were no taboos. It is easy to criticize the chaotic upsurge of 
thoughts, ideas and proposals unleashed in such circumstances. "Professional 
revolutionaries" and petty bourgeois philistines criticized to their heart's 
content. But in so doing they only revealed how they themselves were trapped in 
the ideology of a previous epoch and were incapable of transcending it. They 
failed to recognize the tremendous significance of the new, of all that could 
not be apprehended within their own pre-established intellectual categories. The 
phenomenon was witnessed again and again, as it doubtless has been in every 
really great upheaval in history.</p>

<p class="fst">Day and night, every lecture theatre was packed out, the seat of 
continuous, passionate debate on every subject that ever preoccupied thinking 
humanity. No formal lecturer ever enjoyed so massive an audience, was ever 
listened to with such rapt attention - or given such short shrift if he talked 
nonsense.</p>

<p class="fst">A kind of order rapidly prevailed. By the second day a 
noticeboard had appeared near the front entrance announcing what was being 
talked about, and where. I noted: "Organization of the struggle"; "Political and 
trade union rights in the University"; "University crisis or social crisis?"; 
"Dossier of police repression"; "Self-management"; "Non-selection" (or how to 
open the doors of the University to everyone); "Methods of teaching"; "Exams"; 
etc. Other lecture theatres were given over to the Students-Workers Liaison 
Committees, soon to assume great importance. In yet other halls, discussions 
were under way on "sexual repression", on "the colonial question", on "ideology 
and mystification". Any group of people wishing to discuss anything under the 
sun would just take over one of the lecture theatres or smaller rooms. 
Fortunately there were dozens of these.</p>

<p class="fst">The first impression was of a gigantic lid suddenly lifted, of 
pent-up thoughts and aspirations suddenly exploding on being released from the 
realm of dreams into the realm of the real and the possible. In changing their 
environment people themselves were changed. Those who had never dared say 
anything suddenly felt their thoughts to be the most important thing in the 
world and said so. The shy became communicative. The helpless and isolated 
suddenly discovered that collective power lay in their hands. The traditionally 
apathetic suddenly realized the intensity of their involvement. A tremendous 
surge of community and cohesion gripped those who had previously seen themselves 
as isolated and impotent puppets, dominated by institutions that they could 
neither control nor understand. People just went up and talked to one another 
without a trace of self-consciousness. This state of euphoria lasted throughout 
the whole fortnight I was there. An inscription scrawled on a wall sums it up 
perfectly: "<i>Déjà dix jours de bonheur</i>" (Ten days of happiness already).</p>

<p class="fst">In the yard of the Sorbonne, politics (frowned on for a 
generation) took over with a vengeance. Literature stalls sprouted up along the 
whole inner perimeter. Enormous portraits appeared on the internal walls: Marx, 
Lenin, Trotsky, Mao, Castro, Guevara, a revolutionary resurrection breaking the 
bounds of time and place. Even Stalin put in a transient appearance (above a 
Maoist stall) until it was tactfully suggested to the comrades that he wasn't 
really at home in such company.</p>

<p class="fst">On the stalls themselves every kind of literature suddenly 
blossomed forth in the summer sunshine: leaflets and pamphlets by anarchists, 
Stalinists, Maoists, Trotskyists (three varieties), the PSU and the 
non-committed. The yard of the Sorbonne had become a gigantic revolutionary 
drug-store, in which the most esoteric products no longer had to be kept beneath 
the counter but could now be prominently displayed. Old issues of journals, 
yellowed by the years, were unearthed and often sold as well as more recent 
material. Everywhere there were groups often or twenty people, in heated 
discussion, people talking about the barricades, about the CRS, about their own 
experiences, but also about the Commune of 1871, about 1905 and 1917, about the 
Italian left in 1921 and about France in 1936. A fusion was taking place between 
the consciousness of the revolutionary minorities and the consciousness of whole 
new layers of people, dragged day by day into the maelstrom of political 
controversy. The students were learning within days what it had taken others a 
lifetime to learn. Many <i>lycéens</i> came to see what it was all about. They 
too got sucked into the vortex. I remember a boy of fourteen explaining to an 
incredulous man of sixty why students should have the right to depose 
professors.</p>

<p class="fst">Other things also happened. A large piano suddenly appeared in 
the great central yard and remained there for several days. People would come 
and play on it, surrounded by enthusiastic supporters. As people talked in the 
lecture theatres of neo-capitalism and of its techniques of manipulation, 
strands of Chopin and bars of jazz, bits of <i>La Carmagnole</i> and atonal 
compositions wafted through the air. One evening there was a drum recital, then 
some clarinet players took over. These "diversions" may have infuriated some of 
the more single-minded revolutionaries, but they were as much part and parcel of 
the total transformation of the Sorbonne as were the revolutionary doctrines 
being proclaimed in the lecture halls.</p>

<p class="fst">An exhibition of huge photographs of the "night of the 
barricades" (in beautiful half-tones) appeared one morning mounted on stands. No 
one knew who had put it up. Everyone agreed that it succinctly summarized the 
horror and glamour, the anger and promise of that fateful night. Even the doors 
of the chapel giving on to the yard were soon covered with inscriptions. "Open 
this door - <i>Finis</i>, <i>le tabernacles</i>". "Religion is the last 
mystification". Or more prosaically: "We want somewhere to piss, not somewhere 
to pray".</p>

<p class="fst">The massive outer walls of the Sorbonne were likewise soon 
plastered with posters - posters announcing the first sit-in strikes, posters 
describing the wage rates of whole sections of Paris workers, posters announcing 
the next demonstrations, posters describing the solidarity marches in Peking 
posters denouncing the police repression and the use of CS gas (as well as of 
ordinary tear-gas) against the demonstrators. There were posters, dozens of 
them, warning students against the Communist Party's bandwagon jumping tactics, 
telling them how it had attacked their movement and how it was now seeking to 
assume its leadership. Political posters in plenty. But also others, proclaiming 
the new ethos. A big one for instance near the main entrance, boldly proclaimed 
"<i>Défense d'interdire</i>" (Forbidding forbidden). And others, equally to the 
point: "Only the truth is revolutionary"; "Our revolution is greater than 
ourselves"; "We refuse the role assigned to us, we will not be trained as police 
dogs". People's concerns varied but converged. The posters reflected the deeply 
libertarian prevailing philosophy. "Humanity will only be happy when the last 
capitalist has been strangled with the guts of the last bureaucrat". "Culture is 
disintegrating. Create!" "I take my wishes for reality for I believe in the 
reality of my wishes". Or more simply: "Creativity, spontaneity, life".</p>

<p class="fst">In the street outside, hundreds of passers-by would stop to read 
these improvised wall-newspapers. Some gaped. Some sniggered. Some nodded 
assent. Some argued. Some, summoning their courage, actually entered the 
erstwhile sacrosanct premises, as they were being exhorted to by numerous 
posters proclaiming that the Sorbonne was now open to all. Young workers who 
"wouldn't have been seen in that place" a month ago now walked in groups, at 
first rather self-consciously, later as if they owned the place, which of course 
they did.</p>

<p class="fst">As the days went by, another kind of invasion took place: the 
invasion by the cynical and the unbelieving or - more charitably - by those who 
"had only come to see". It gradually gained momentum. At certain stages it 
threatened to paralyze the serious work being done, part of which had to be 
hived off to the Faculty of Letters, at Censier, also occupied by the students. 
It was felt necessary, however, for the doors to be kept open, 24 hours a day. 
The message certainly spread. Deputations came first from other universities, 
then from high schools, later from factories and offices, to look, to question, 
to argue, to study.</p>

<p class="fst">The most telling sign, however, of the new and heady climate was 
to be found on the walls of the Sorbonne corridors. Around the main lecture 
theatres there is a maze of such corridors: dark, dusty, depressing and hitherto 
unnoticed passageways leading from nowhere in particular to nowhere else. 
Suddenly these corridors sprang to life in a firework of luminous mural wisdom - 
much of it of Situationist inspiration. Hundreds of people suddenly stopped to 
read such pearls as: "Do not consume Marx. Live if. "The future will only 
contain what we put into it now". "When examined, we will answer with 
questions". "Professors, you make us feel old". "One doesn't compose with a 
society in decomposition". "We must remain the maladjusted ones". "Workers of 
all lands, enjoy yourselves". "Those who carry out a revolution only halfway 
through merely dig themselves a tomb (St. Just)". "Please leave the PC 
(Communist Party) as clean on leaving as you would like to find it on entering". 
"The tears of the philistines are the nectar of the gods". "Co and die in 
Naples, with the Club Mediterranee". "Long live communication, down with 
telecommunication". "Masochism today dresses up as reformism". "We will claim 
nothing. We will ask for nothing. We will take. We will occupy". "The only 
outrage to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was the outrage that put him there". 
"No, we won't be picked up by the Great Party of the Working Class". And a big 
inscription, well displayed: "Since 1936 I have fought for wage increases. My 
father, before me, also fought for wage increases. Now I have a telly, a fridge, 
a Volkswagen. Yet all in all, my life has always been a cunt's life. Don't 
discuss with the bosses. Eliminate them".</p>

<p class="fst">Day after day the courtyard and corridors are crammed, the scene 
of an incessant bi-directional flow to every conceivable part of the enormous 
building. It may look like chaos, but it is the chaos of a beehive or of an 
anthill. A new structure is gradually being evolved. A canteen has been 
organized in one big hall, people pay what they can afford for glasses of orange 
juice, <i>menthe</i>, or <i>grenadine</i> - and for ham or sausage rolls. I 
inquire whether costs are covered and am told they more or less break even. In 
another part of the building a children's creche has been set up, elsewhere a 
first-aid station, elsewhere a dormitory. Regular sweeping-up rotas are 
organized. Rooms are allocated to the Occupation Committee, to the Press 
Committee, to the Propaganda Committee, to the Student-Worker Liaison 
Committees, to the committees dealing with foreign students, to the Action 
Committees of <i>Lycéens</i>, to the committees dealing with the allocation of 
premises, and to the numerous commissions undertaking special projects such as 
the compiling of a dossier on police atrocities, the study of the implications 
of autonomy, of the examination system, etc. Anyone seeking work can readily 
find it.</p>

<p class="fst">The composition of the committees was very variable. It often 
changed from day to day, as the committees gradually found their feet. To those 
who pressed for instant solutions to every problem it would be answered: 
"Patience, comrade. Give us a chance to evolve an alternative. The bourgeoisie 
has controlled this university for nearly two centuries. It has solved nothing. 
We are building from rock bottom. We need a month or two ..."</p>

<p class="fst">Confronted with this tremendous explosion which it had neither 
foreseen nor been able to control the Communist Party tried desperately to 
salvage what it could of its shattered reputation. Between May 3rd and May 13th 
every issue of <i>L'Humanité</i> had carried paragraphs either attacking the 
students or making slimy innuendoes about them. Now the line suddenly changed.</p>

<p class="fst">The Party sent dozens of its best agitators into the Sorbonne to 
"explain" its case. The case was a simple one. The Party "supported the 
students" - even if there were a few "dubious elements" in their leadership. It 
"always had". It always would.</p>

<p class="fst">Amazing scenes followed. Every Stalinist "agitator" would 
immediately be surrounded by a large group of well-informed young people, 
denouncing the Party's counter-revolutionary role. A wall paper had been put up 
by the comrades of <i>Voix Ouvrière</i> on which had been posted, day by day, 
every statement attacking the students to have appeared in <i>L'Humanité</i> or 
in any of a dozen Party leaflets. The "agitators" couldn't get a word in 
edgeways. They would be jumped on (non-violently). "The evidence was over there, 
comrade. Would the Party comrades like to come and read just exactly what the 
Party had been saying not a week ago? Perhaps <i>L'Humanité</i> would like to 
grant the students space to reply to some of the accusations made against them?" 
Others in the audience would then bring up the Party's role during the Algerian 
War, during the miners' strike of 1958, during the years of <i>tripartisme</i> 
(1945-1947). Wriggle as they tried, the "agitators" just could not escape this 
kind of "instant education". It was interesting to note that the Party could not 
entrust this "salvaging" operation to its younger, student members. Only the 
"older comrades" could safely venture into this hornets' nest. So much so that 
people would say that anyone in the Sorbonne over the age of forty was either a 
copper's nark or a Stalinist stooge.</p>

<p class="fst">The most dramatic periods of the occupation were undoubtedly the <i>
Assemblées Générales</i>, or plenary sessions, held every night in the giant 
amphitheatre. This was the soviet, the ultimate source of all decisions, the 
fount and origin of direct democracy. The amphitheatre could seat up to 5,000 
people in its enormous hemicycle, surmounted by three balcony tiers. As often as 
not every seat was taken and the crowd would flow up the aisles and on to the 
podium. A black flag and a red one hung over the simple wooden table at which 
the chairman sat. Having seen meetings of fifty break up in chaos it is an 
amazing experience to see a meeting of 5,000 get down to business. Real events 
determined the themes and ensured that most of the talk was down to earth.</p>

<p class="fst">The topic having been decided, everyone was allowed to speak. 
Most speeches were made from the podium but some from the body of the hall or 
from the balconies. The loudspeaker equipment usually worked but sometimes 
didn't. Some speakers could command immediate attention, without even raising 
their voice. Others would instantly provoke a hostile response by the stridency 
of their tone, their insincerity or their more or less obvious attempts at 
manoeuvring the assembly. Anyone who waffled, or reminisced, or came to recite a 
set-piece, or talked in terms of slogans, was given short shrift by the 
audience, politically the most sophisticated I have ever seen. Anyone making 
practical suggestions was listened to attentively. So were those who sought to 
interpret the movement in terms of its own experience or to point the way ahead.</p>

<p class="fst">Most speakers were granted three minutes. Some were allowed much 
more by popular acclaim. The crowd itself exerted a tremendous control on the 
platform and on the speakers. A two-way relationship emerged very quickly. The 
political maturity of the Assembly was shown most strikingly in its rapid 
realization that booing or cheering during speeches slowed down the Assembly's 
own deliberations. Positive speeches were loudly cheered - at the end. Demagogic 
or useless ones were impatiently swept aside. Conscious revolutionary minorities 
played an important catalytic role in these deliberations, but never sought - at 
least the more intelligent ones - to impose their will on the mass body. 
Although in the early stages the Assembly had its fair share of exhibitionists, 
provocateurs and nuts, the overhead costs of direct democracy were not as heavy 
as one might have expected.</p>

<p class="fst">There were moments of excitement and moments of exhortation. On 
the night of May 13th, after the massive march through the streets of Paris, 
Daniel Cohn-Bendit confronted J. M. Catala, general secretary of the Union of 
Communist Students, in front of the packed auditorium. The scene remains printed 
in my mind. "Explain to us", Cohn-Bendit said, "why the Communist Party and the 
CGT told their militants to disperse at Denfert-Rochereau, why it prevented them 
joining up with us for a discussion at the Champ de Mars?"</p>

<p class="fst">"Simple, really", sneered Catala. "The agreement concluded 
between the CGT, the CFDT, the UNEF and the other sponsoring organizations 
stipulated that dispersal would take place at a predetermined place. The Joint 
Sponsoring Committee had not sanctioned any further developments ..."</p>

<p class="fst">"A revealing answer", replied Cohn-Bendit, "the organizations 
hadn't foreseen that we would be a million in the streets. But life is bigger 
than the organizations. With a million people almost anything is possible. You 
say the Committee hadn't sanctioned anything further. On the day of the 
Revolution, comrade, you will doubtless tell us to forego it 'because it hasn't 
been sanctioned by the appropriate sponsoring committee' ..."</p>

<p class="fst">This brought the house down. The only ones who didn't rise to 
cheer were a few dozen Stalinists. Also, revealingly, those Trotskyists who 
tacitly accepted the Stalinist conceptions - and whose only quarrel with the CP 
is that it had excluded them from being one of the "sponsoring organizations".</p>

<p class="fst">That same night the Assembly took three important decisions. From 
now on the Sorbonne would constitute itself as a revolutionary headquarters 
("Smolny", someone shouted). Those who worked there would devote their main 
efforts not to a mere reorganization of the educational system, but to a total 
subversion of bourgeois society. From now on the University would be open to all 
those who subscribed to these aims. The proposals having been accepted the 
audience rose to a man and sang the loudest, most impassioned <i>Internationale</i> 
I have ever heard. The echoes must have reverberated as far as the Elysée Palace 
on the other side of the River Seine ...</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<h2><a name="h10">The Censier Revolutionaries</a></h2>

<p class="fst">At the same time as the students occupied the Sorbonne, they also 
took over the Centre Censier (the new Paris University Faculty of Letters).</p>

<p class="fst">Censier is an enormous, ultra-modern, steel-concrete-and-glass 
affair situated at the south-east corner of the Latin Quarter. Its occupation 
attracted less attention than did that of the Sorbonne. It was to prove, 
however, just as significant an event. For while the Sorbonne was the shop 
window of revolutionary Paris - with all that that implies in terms of garish 
display - Censier was its dynamo, the place where things really got done.</p>

<p class="fst">To many, the Paris May Days must have been an essentially 
nocturnal affair: nocturnal battles with the CRS, nocturnal barricades, 
nocturnal debates in the great amphitheatres. But this was but one side of the 
coin. While some argued late into the Sorbonne night, others went to bed early 
for in the mornings they would be handing out leaflets at factory gates or in 
the suburbs, leaflets that had to be drafted, typed, duplicated, and the 
distribution of which had to be carefully organized. This patient, systematic 
work was done at Censier. It contributed in no small measure to giving the new 
revolutionary consciousness articulate expression.</p>

<p class="fst">Soon after Censier had been occupied a group of activists 
commandeered a large part of the third floor. This space was to be the 
headquarters of their proposed "worker-student action committees". The general 
idea was to establish links with groups of workers, however small, who shared 
the general libertarian-revolutionary outlook of this group of students. Contact 
having been made, workers and students would cooperate in the joint drafting of 
leaflets. The leaflets would discuss the immediate problems of particular groups 
of workers, but in the light of what the students had shown to be possible. A 
given leaflet would then be jointly distributed by workers and students, outside 
the particular factory or office to which it referred. In some instances the 
distribution would have to be undertaken by students alone, in others hardly a 
single student would be needed.</p>

<p class="fst">What brought the Censier comrades together was a deeply felt 
sense of the revolutionary potentialities of the situation and the knowledge 
that they had no time to waste. They all felt the pressing need for direct 
action propaganda, and that the urgency of the situation required of them that 
they transcend any doctrinal differences they might have with one another. They 
were all intensely political people. By and large, their politics were those of 
that new and increasingly important historical species: the ex-members of one or 
other revolutionary organization.</p>

<p class="fst">What were their views? Basically they boiled down to a few simple 
propositions. What was needed just now was a rapid, autonomous development of 
the working-class struggle, the setting up of elected strike committees which 
would link union and non-union members in all strike-bound plants and 
enterprises, regular meetings of the strikers so that the fundamental decisions 
remained in the hands of the rank and file, workers' defence committees to 
defend pickets from police intimidation, a constant dialogue with the 
revolutionary students aimed at restoring to the working class its own tradition 
of direct democracy and its own aspiration to self-management (<i>autogestion</i>), 
usurped by the bureaucracies of the trade unions and the political parties.</p>

<p class="fst">For a whole week the various Trotskyist and Maoist factions 
didn't even notice what was going on at Censier. They spent their time in public 
and often acrimonious debates at the Sorbonne as to who could provide the best 
leadership. Meanwhile, the comrades at Censier were steadily getting on with the 
work. The majority of them had "been through" either Stalinist or Trotskyist 
organizations. They had left behind them all ideas to the effect that 
"intervention" was meaningful only in terms of potential recruitment to their 
own particular group. All recognized the need for a widely-based and moderately 
structured revolutionary movement, but none of them saw the building of such a 
movement as an immediate, all important task, on which propaganda should 
immediately be centred.</p>

<p class="fst">Duplicators belonging to "subversive elements" were brought in. 
University duplicators were commandeered. Stocks of paper and ink were obtained 
from various sources and by various means. Leaflets began to pour out, first in 
hundreds, then in thousands, then in tens of thousands as links were established 
with one group of rank-and-file workers after another. On the first day alone, 
Renault, Citroën, Air France, Boussac, the Nouvelles Messageries de Presse, 
Rhône-Poulenc and the RATP (Métro) were contacted. The movement then snowballed.</p>

<p class="fst">Every evening at Censier, the action committees reported back to 
an <i>Assemblée Générale</i> devoted exclusively to this kind of work. The 
reactions to the distribution were assessed, the content of future leaflets 
discussed. These discussions would usually be led off by the worker contact who 
would describe the impact of the leaflet on his workmates. The most heated 
discussion centred on whether direct attacks should be made on the leaders of 
the CGT or whether mere suggestions as to what was needed to win would be 
sufficient to expose everything the union leaders had (or hadn't) done and 
everything they stood for. The second viewpoint prevailed.</p>

<p class="fst">The leaflets were usually very short, never more than 200 or 300 
words. They nearly all started by listing the workers' grievances - or just by 
describing their conditions of work. They would end by inviting workers to call 
at Censier or at the Sorbonne. "These places are now yours. Come there to 
discuss your problems with others. Take a hand yourselves in making known your 
problems and demands to those around you." Between this kind of opening and this 
kind of conclusion, most leaflets contained one or two key political points.</p>

<p class="fst">The response was instantaneous. More and more workers dropped in 
to draft joint leaflets with the students. Soon there was no lecture room big 
enough for the daily <i>Assemblée Générale</i>. The students learned a great 
deal from the workers' self-discipline and from the systematic way in which they 
presented their reports. It was all so different from the "in-fighting" of the 
political sects. There was agreement that these were the finest lectures ever 
held at Censier!</p>

<p class="fst">Among the more telling lines of these leaflets, I noted the 
following: <i>Air France leaflet</i>: "We refuse to accept a degrading 
'modernization' which means we are constantly watched and have to submit to 
conditions which are harmful to our health, to our nervous systems and an insult 
to our status of human beings ... We refuse to entrust our demands any longer to 
professional trade union leaders. Like the students, we must take the control of 
our affairs into our own hands."</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Renault leaflet</i>: "If we want our wage increases and our 
claims concerning conditions of work to be secure, if we don't want them 
constantly threatened, we must now struggle for a fundamental change in society 
... As workers we should ourselves seek to control the operation of our 
enterprises. Our objectives are similar to those of the students. The management 
(<i>gestion</i>) of industry and the management of the university should be 
democratically ensured by those who work there ..."</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Rhône-Poulenc leaflet</i>: "Up till now we tried to solve our 
problems through petitions, partial struggles, the election of better leaders. 
This has led us nowhere. The action of the students has shown us that only 
rank-and-file action could compel the authorities to retreat ... the students 
are challenging the whole purpose of bourgeois education. They want to take the 
fundamental decisions themselves. So should we. <i>We</i> should decide the 
purpose of production, and at whose cost production will be carried out."</p>

<p class="fst"><i>District leaflet</i> (distributed in the streets at 
Boulogne-Billancourt): "The government fears the extension of the movement. It 
fears the developing unity between workers and students. Pompidou has announced 
that 'the government will defend the Republic'. The Army and police are being 
prepared. De Gaulle will speak on the 24th. Will he send the CRS to clear 
pickets out of strikebound plants? Be prepared. In workshops and faculties, 
think in terms of self-defence ..."</p>

<p class="fst">Every day dozens of such leaflets were discussed, typed, 
duplicated, distributed. Every evening we heard of the response: "The blokes 
think it's tremendous. It's just what they are thinking. The union officials 
never talk like this". "The blokes liked the leaflet. They are sceptical about 
the 12 per cent. They say prices will go up and that we'll lose it all in a few 
months. Some say let's push all together now and take on the lot." "The leaflet 
certainly started the lads talking. They've never had so much to say. The 
officials had to wait their turn to speak ..."</p>

<p class="fst">I vividly remember a young printing worker who said one night 
that these meetings were the most exciting thing that had ever happened to him. 
All his life he had dreamed of meeting people who thought and spoke like this. 
But every time he thought he had met one all they were interested in was what 
they could get out of him. This was the first time he had been offered 
disinterested help. I don't know what has happened at Censier since the end of 
May. When I left, sundry Trots were beginning to move in, "to politicize the 
leaflets" (by which I presume they meant that the leaflets should now talk about 
"the need to build the revolutionary Party"). If they succeed - which I doubt, 
knowing the calibre of the Censier comrades - it will be a tragedy.</p>

<p class="fst">The leaflets <i>were</i> in fact political. During the whole of 
my short stay in France I saw nothing more intensely and relevantly political 
(in the best sense of the term) than the sustained campaign emanating from 
Censier, a campaign for constant control of the struggle from below, for 
self-defence, for workers' management of production, for popularizing the 
concept of Workers' Councils, for explaining to one and all the tremendous 
relevance, in a revolutionary situation, of revolutionary demands, of organized 
self-activity, of collective self-reliance.</p>

<p class="fst">As I left Censier I could not help thinking how the place 
epitomized the crisis of modern bureaucratic capitalism. Censier is no 
educational slum. It is an ultra-modern building, one of the showpieces of 
Gaullist <i>grandeur</i>. It has closed-circuit television in the lecture 
theatres, modern plumbing, and slot machines distributing 24 different kinds of 
food - in sterilized containers - and ten different kinds of drink. Over 90 per 
cent of the students there are of petty bourgeois or bourgeois backgrounds. Yet 
such is their rejection of the society that nurtured them that they were working 
duplicators 24 hours a day, turning out a flood of revolutionary literature of a 
kind no modern city has ever had pushed into it before. This kind of activity 
had transformed these students and had contributed to transforming the 
environment around them. They were simultaneously disrupting the social 
structure and having the time of their lives. In the words of a slogan scrawled 
on the wall: "<i>On n'est pas là pour s'emmerder</i>" (you'll have to look this 
one up in the dictionary).</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<h2><a name="h11">Getting Together</a></h2>

<p class="fst">When the news of the first factory occupation (that of the Sud 
Aviation plant at Nantes) reached the Sorbonne - late during the night of 
Tuesday, May 14th - there were scenes of indescribable enthusiasm. Sessions were 
interrupted for the announcement. Everyone seemed to sense the significance of 
what had just happened. After a full minute of continuous, delirious cheering, 
the audience broke into a synchronous, rhythmical clapping, apparently reserved 
for great occasions.</p>

<p class="fst">On Thursday, May 16, the Renault factories at Cléon (near Rouen) 
and at Flins (north-west of Paris) were occupied. Excited groups in the Sorbonne 
yard remained glued to their transistors as hour by hour news came over of 
further occupations. Enormous posters were put up, both inside and outside the 
Sorbonne, with the most up-to-date information of which factories had been 
occupied: the Nouvelles Messageries de Presse in Paris, Kléber-Colombes at 
Caudebec, Dresser-Dujardin at Le Havre, the naval shipyard at Le Trait ... and 
finally the Renault works at Boulogne-Billancourt. Within 48 hours the task had 
to be abandoned. No noticeboard - or panel of noticeboards - was large enough. 
At last the students felt that the battle had really been joined.</p>

<p class="fst">Early on the Friday afternoon an emergency <i>Assemblée Générale</i> 
was held. The meeting decided to send a big student deputation to the occupied 
Renault works. Its aim was to establish contact, express student solidarity and, 
if possible, discuss common problems. The march was scheduled to leave the Place 
de la Sorbonne at 6.00 pm.</p>

<p class="fst">At about 5.00 pm thousands of leaflets were suddenly distributed 
in the amphitheatre, in the Sorbonne yard and in the streets around. They were 
signed by the Renault Bureau of the CGT The Communist Party had been working ... 
fast. The leaflets read:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"We have just heard that students and teachers are proposing 
to set out this afternoon in the direction of Renault. This decision was taken 
without consulting the appropriate trade union sections of the CGT, CFDT and FO.</p>

<p class="quoteb">We greatly appreciate the solidarity of the students and 
teachers in the common struggle against the <i>pouvoir personnel</i> (i.e. de 
Gaulle) and the employers but are opposed to any ill-judged initiative which 
might threaten our developing movement and facilitate a provocation which would 
lead to a diversion by the government.</p>

<p class="quoteb">We strongly advise the organizers of this demonstration 
against preceding with their plans.</p>

<p class="quoteb">We intend, together with the workers now struggling for their 
claims, to lead our own strike. We refuse any external intervention, in 
conformity with the declaration jointly signed by the CGT, CFDT and FO unions, 
and approved this morning by 23,000 workers belonging to the factory."</p>

<p class="fst">The distortion and dishonesty of this leaflet defy description. 
No one intended to instruct the workers how to run the strike and no student 
would have the presumption to seek to assume its leadership. All that the 
students wanted was to express solidarity with the workers in what was now a 
common struggle against the state and the employing class.</p>

<p class="fst">The CGT leaflet came like an icy shower to the less political 
students and to all those who still had illusions about Stalinism. "They won't 
let us get through". "The workers don't want to talk with us". The 
identification of workers with "their" organizations is very hard to break down. 
Several hundred who had intended to march to Billancourt were probably put off. 
The UNEF vacillated, reluctant to lead the march in direct violation of the 
wishes of the CGT.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally some 1,500 people set out, under a single banner, hastily 
prepared by some Maoist students. The banner proclaimed: "The strong hands of 
the working class must now take over the torch from the fragile hands of the 
students". Many joined the march who were not Maoists and who didn't necessarily 
agree with this particular formulation of its objectives.</p>

<p class="fst">Although small when compared to other marches, this was certainly 
a most political one. Practically everyone on it belonged to one or other of the <i>
groupuscules</i>: a spontaneous united front of Maoists, Trotskyists, 
anarchists, the comrades of the Mouvement du 22 Mars and various others. 
Everyone knew exactly what he was doing. It was this that was so to infuriate 
the Communist Party.</p>

<p class="fst">The march sets off noisily, crosses the Boulevard St.-Michel, and 
passes in front of the occupied Odéon Theatre (where several hundred more 
joyfully join it). It then proceeds at a very brisk pace down the Rue de 
Vaugirard, the longest street in Paris, towards the working-class districts to 
the south-west of the city, growing steadily in size and militancy as it 
advances. It is important we reach the factory before the Stalinists have time 
to mobilize their big battalions ... </p>

<p class="fst">Slogans such as "<i>Avec nous</i>, <i>chez Renault</i>" (Come 
with us to Renault), "<i>Le pouvoir est dans la rue</i>" (Power lies in the 
street), "<i>Le pouvoir aux ouvriers</i>" (Power to the workers), are shouted 
lustily, again and again. The Maoists shout "<i>A has le gouvernement gaulliste 
anti-populaire de chomage et de misère</i>" - a long and politically equivocal 
slogan, but one eminently suited to collective shouting. The <i>Internationale</i> 
bursts out repeatedly, sung this time by people who seem to know the words - 
even the second verse!</p>

<p class="fst">By the time we have marched the five miles to Issy-les-Moulineaux 
it is already dark. Way behind us now are the bright lights of the Latin Quarter 
and of the fashionable Paris known to tourists. We go through small, poorly lit 
streets, the uncollected rubbish piled high in places. Dozens of young people 
join us en route, attracted by the noise and the singing of revolutionary songs 
such as <i>La Jeune Garde</i>, <i>Zimmerwald</i>, and the song of the Partisans. 
"<i>Chez Renault</i>, <i>chez Renault</i>", the marchers shout. People 
congregate in the doors of the bistros, or peer out of the windows of crowded 
flats to watch us pass. Some look on in amazement but many - possibly a majority 
- now clap or wave encouragement. In some streets many Algerians line the 
pavement. Some join in the shouting of "<i>CRS - SS</i>", "<i>Charonne</i>", "<i>A 
bas l'Etat policier</i>". They have not forgotten. Most look on shyly or smile 
in an embarrassed way. Very few join the march.</p>

<p class="fst">On we go, a few miles more. There isn't a gendarme in sight. We 
cross the Seine and eventually slow down as we approach a square beyond which 
lie the Renault works. The streets here are very badly lit. There is a sense of 
intense excitement in the air.</p>

<p class="fst">We suddenly come up against a lorry, parked across most of the 
road, and fitted with loudspeaker equipment. The march stops. On the lorry 
stands a CGT official. He speaks for five minutes. In somewhat chilly tones he 
says how pleased he is to see us. "Thank you for coming, comrades. We appreciate 
your solidarity. But please no provocations. Don't go too near the gates as the 
management would use it as an excuse to call the police. And go home soon. It's 
cold and you'll need all your strength in the days to come".</p>

<p class="fst">The students have brought their own loudhailers. One or two 
speak, briefly. They take note of the comments of the comrade from the CGT. They 
have no intention of provoking anyone, no wish to usurp anyone's functions. We 
then slowly but quite deliberately move forwards into the square, on each side 
of the lorry, drowning the protests of about a hundred Stalinists in a powerful <i>
Internationale</i>. Workers in neighbouring cafes come out and join us. This 
time the Party had not had time to mobilize its militants. It could not 
physically isolate us.</p>

<p class="fst">Part of the factory now looms up right ahead of us, three storeys 
high on our left, two storeys high on our right. In front of us, there is a 
giant metal gate, closed and bolted. A large first floor window to our right is 
crowded with workers. The front row sit with their legs dangling over the sill. 
Several seem in their teens; one of them waves a big red flag. There are no <i>
tricolores</i> in sight - no "dual allegiance" as in other occupied places I had 
seen. Several dozen more workers are on the roofs of the two buildings.</p>

<p class="fst">We wave. They wave back. We sing the <i>Internationale</i>. They 
join in. We give the clenched fist salute. They do likewise. Everybody cheers. 
Contact has been made.</p>

<p class="fst">An interesting exchange takes place. A group of demonstrators 
starts shouting "<i>Les usines aux ouvriers</i>" (The factories to the workers). 
The slogan spreads like wildfire through the crowd. The Maoists, now in a 
definite minority, are rather annoyed. (According to Chairman Mao, workers' 
control is a petty bourgeois, anarcho-syndicalist deviation.) "<i>Les usines aux 
ouvriers</i>" ... ten, twenty times the slogan reverberates round the Place 
Nationale, taken up by a crowd now some 3,000 strong.</p>

<p class="fst">As the shouting subsides, a lone voice from one of the Renault 
roofs shouts back: "<i>La Sorbonne aux Etudiants</i>". Other workers on the same 
roof take it up. Then those on the other roof. By the volume of their voices 
they must be at least a hundred of them, on top of each building. There is then 
a moment of silence. Everyone thinks the exchange has come to an end. But one of 
the demonstrators starts chanting: "<i>La Sorbonne aux ouvriers</i>". Amid 
general laughter, everyone joins in.</p>

<p class="fst">We start talking. A rope is quickly passed down from the window, 
a bucket at the end of it. Bottles of beer and packets of fags are passed up. 
Also revolutionary leaflets. Also bundles of papers (mainly copies of <i>Server 
le Peuple</i> - a Maoist journal carrying a big title, <i>Vive la CGT</i>). At 
street level there are a number of gaps in the metal facade of the building. 
Groups of students cluster at these half-dozen openings and talk to groups of 
workers on the other side. They discuss wages, conditions, the CRS, what the 
lads inside need most, how the students can help. The men talk freely. They are 
not Party members. They think the constant talk of provocateurs a bit 
far-fetched. But the machines must be protected. We point out that two or three 
students inside the factory, escorted by the strike committee, couldn't possibly 
damage the machines. They agree. We contrast the widely open doors of the 
Sorbonne with the heavy locks and bolts on the Renault gates - closed by the CGT 
officials to prevent the ideological contamination of "their" militants. How 
silly, we say, to have to talk through these stupid little slits in the wall. 
Again they agree. They will put it to their <i>dirigeants</i> (leaders). No one 
seems, as yet, to think beyond this.</p>

<p class="fst">There is then a diversion. A hundred yards away a member of the 
FER gets up on a parked car and starts making a speech through a loudhailer. The 
intervention is completely out of tune with the dialogue that is just starting. 
It's the same gramophone record we have been hearing all week at the Sorbonne. 
"Call on the union leaders to organize the election of strike committees in 
every factory. Force the union leaders to federate the strike committees. Force 
the union leaders to set up a national strike committee. Force them to call a 
general strike throughout the whole of the country". (This at a time when 
millions of workers are already on strike without any call whatsoever.) The tone 
is strident, almost hysterical, the misjudging of the mood monumental. The 
demonstrators themselves drown the speaker in a loud <i>Internationale</i>. As 
the last bar fades the Trotskyist tries again. Again the demonstrators drown 
him.</p>

<p class="fst">Groups stroll up the Avenue Yves Kermen, to the other entrances 
to the factory. Real contact is here more difficult to establish. There is a 
crowd outside the gate, but most of them are Party members. Some won't talk at 
all. Others just talk slogans.</p>

<p class="fst">We walk back to the square. It is now well past midnight. The 
crowd thins. Groups drop into a couple of cafes which are still open. Here we 
meet a whole group of young workers, aged about eighteen. They had been in the 
factory earlier in the day.</p>

<p class="fst">They tell us that at any given time, just over 1,000 workers are 
engaged in the occupation. The strike started on the Thursday afternoon, at 
about 2.00 pm, when the group of youngsters from shop 70 decided to down tools 
and to spread into all parts of the factory asking their mates to do likewise. 
That same morning they had heard of the occupation of Cléon and that the red 
flag was floating over the factory at Flins. There had been a hint of talk about 
what to do. At a midday meeting tile CGT had spoken vaguely of a series of 
rotating strikes, shop by shop, to be initiated the following day.</p>

<p class="fst">The movement spread at an incredible pace. The youngsters went 
round shouting "<i>Occupation! Occupation!</i>" Half the factory had stopped 
working before the union officials realized what was happening. At about 4.00 pm 
Sylvain, a CGT secretary, had arrived with loudspeaker equipment to tell them, 
"they weren't numerous enough, to start work again, that they would see tomorrow 
about a one-day strike". He is absolutely by-passed. At 5.00 pm Halbeher, 
general secretary of the Renault CGT, announces, pale as a sheet, that "the CGT 
has called for the occupation of the factory". "Tell your friends", the lads 
say. "<i>We started it</i>. But will we be able to keep it in our hands? <i>Cà</i>, <i>
c'est un autre problème</i> ..."</p>

<p class="fst">Students? Well, hats off to anyone who can thump the cops that 
hard! The lads tell us of two of their mates who disappeared from the factory 
altogether ten days ago "to help the Revolution". Left family, jobs, everything. 
And good luck to them. "A chance like this comes once in a lifetime". We discuss 
plans, how to develop the movement. The occupied factory could be a ghetto, "<i>isolant 
les durs</i>" (isolating the most militant). We talk about camping the cinema, 
the Sorbonne, the future. Almost until sunrise ... </p>

<h2><a name="h12">"Attention aux Provocateurs"</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Social upheavals, such as the one France has just been through, 
leave behind them a trail of shattered reputations. The image of Gaullism as a 
meaningful way of life, "accepted" by the French people, has taken a tremendous 
knock. But so has the image of the Communist Party as a viable challenge to the 
French Establishment.</p>

<p class="fst">As far as the students are concerned the recent actions of the 
PCF (Parti Communiste Français) are such that the Party has probably sealed its 
fate in this milieu for a generation to come. Among the workers the effects are 
more difficult to assess and it would be premature to attempt this assessment. 
All that can be said is that the effects are sure to be profound although they 
will probably take some time to express themselves. The proletarian condition 
itself was for a moment questioned. Prisoners who have had a glimpse of freedom 
do not readily resume a life sentence.</p>

<p class="fst">The full implications of the role of the PCF and of the CGT have 
yet to be appreciated by British revolutionaries. They need above all else to be 
informed. In this section we will document the role of the PCF to the best of 
our ability. It is important to realize that for every ounce of shit thrown at 
the students in its official publications, the Party poured tons more over them 
at meetings or in private conversations. In the nature of things it is more 
difficult to document this kind of slander.</p>

<h4><a name="h13">Friday, May 3</a></h4>

<p class="fst">A meeting was called in the yard of the Sorbonne by UNEF, JCR, 
MAU and FER to protest at the closure of the Nanterre faculty. It was attended 
by militants of the Mouvement du 22 Mars. The police were called in by Rector 
Roche and activists from all these groups were arrested.</p>

<p class="fst">The UEC (Union des Etudiants Communistes) didn't participate in 
this campaign. But it distributed a leaflet in the Sorbonne denouncing the 
activity of the <i>groupuscules</i> (abbreviation for <i>groupes miniscules</i>, 
tiny groups):</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The leaders of the leftist groups are taking advantage of the 
shortcomings of the government. They are exploiting student discontent and 
trying to stop the functioning of the faculties. They are seeking to prevent the 
mass of students from working and from passing their exams. These false 
revolutionaries are acting objectively as allies of the Gaullist power. They are 
acting as supporters of its policies, which are harmful to the mass of the 
students and in particular to those of modest origin."</p>

<p class="fst">On the same day <i>L'Humanité</i> had written: "Certain small 
groups (anarchists, Trotskyists, Maoists) composed mainly of the sons of the big 
bourgeoisie and led by the German anarchist Cohn-Bendit, are taking advantage of 
the shortcomings of the government ... etc. ..." (see above). The same issue of <i>
L'Humanité</i> had published an article by Marchais, a member of the Party's 
Central Committee. This article was to be widely distributed, as a leaflet, in 
factories and offices:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Not satisfied with the agitation they are conducting in the 
student milieu - an agitation which is against the interests of the mass of the 
students and favours fascist provocateurs - these pseudo-revolutionaries now 
have the nerve to seek to give lessons to the working-class movement. We find 
them in increasing numbers at the gates of factories and in places where 
immigrant workers live, distributing leaflets and other propaganda. These false 
revolutionaries must be unmasked, for objectively they are serving the interests 
of the Gaullist power and of the big capitalist monopolies."</p>

<h4><a name="h14">Monday May 6</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The police have been occupying the Latin Quarter over the 
weekend. There have been big student street demonstrations. At the call of UNEF 
and SNESup 20,000 students marched from Denfert-Rochereau to 
St.-Germain-des-Prés calling for the liberation of the arrested workers and 
students. Repeated police assaults on the demonstrators: 422 arrests, 800 
wounded.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>L'Humanite</i> states:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"One can clearly see today the outcome of the adventurous 
actions of the leftist, anarchist, Trotskyist and other groups. Objectively they 
are playing into the hands of the government ... The discredit into which they 
are bringing the student movement is helping feed the violent campaigns of the 
reactionary press and of the ORTF, who by identifying the actions of these 
groups with those of the mass of the students are seeking to isolate the 
students from the mass of the population ..."</p>

<h4><a name="h15">Tuesday, May 7</a></h4>

<p class="fst">UNEF and SNESup call on their supporters to start an unlimited 
strike. Before discussions with the authorities begin they insist on:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"(a) a stop to all legal action against the students and 
workers who have been questioned, arrested or convicted in the course of the 
demonstrations of the last few days;</p>

<p class="quoteb">(b) the withdrawal of the police from the Latin Quarter and 
from all University premises;</p>

<p class="quoteb">(c) a reopening of the closed faculties."</p>

<p class="fst">In a statement showing how completely out of touch they were with 
the deep motives of the student revolt, the "Elected Communist Representatives 
of the Paris Region" declared in <i>L'Humanité</i>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The shortage of credits, of premises, of equipment, of 
teachers ... prevent three students out of four from completing their studies, 
without mentioning all those who never have access to higher education ... This 
situation has caused profound and legitimate discontent among both students and 
teachers. It has also favoured the activity of irresponsible groups whose 
conceptions can offer no solution to the students' problems. It is intolerable 
that the government should take advantage of the behaviour of an infinitesimal 
minority to stop the studies of tens of thousands of students a few days from 
the exams ..."</p>

<p class="fst">The same issue of <i>L'Humanité</i> carried a statement from the 
Sorbonne-Lettres (teachers) branch of the Communist Party:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The Communist teachers demand the liberation of the arrested 
students and the reopening of the Sorbonne. Conscious of our responsibilities, 
we specify that this solidarity does not mean that we agree with or support the 
slogans emanating from certain student organizations. We disapprove of 
unrealistic, demagogic and anti-Communist slogans and of the unwarranted methods 
of action advocated by various leftist groups."</p>

<p class="fst">On the same day Georges Séguy, general secretary of the CGT, 
spoke to the press about the programme of the Festival of Working Class Youth 
(scheduled for May 17-19, but subsequently cancelled): "The solidarity between 
students, teachers and the working class is a familiar notion to the militants 
of the CGT ... It is precisely this tradition that compels us not to tolerate 
any dubious or provocative elements, elements which criticize the working class 
organizations ..."</p>

<h4><a name="h16">Wednesday, May 8</a></h4>

<p class="fst">A big students' demonstration called by UNEF has taken place in 
the streets of Paris the previous evening. The front page of <i>
L'Humanité</i> carries a statement from the Party Secretariat: "The discontent 
of the students is legitimate. But the situation favours adventurist activities, 
whose conception offers no perspective to the students and has nothing in common 
with a really progressive and forward-looking policy".</p>

<p class="fst">In the same issue, J. M. Catala, general secretary of the UEC 
(Union des Etudiants Communistes) writes that "the actions of irresponsible 
groups are assisting the Establishment in its aims ... What we must do is ask 
for a bigger educational budget which would ensure bigger student grants, the 
appointment of more and better qualified teachers, the building of new faculties 
..."</p>

<p class="fst">The UJCF (Union des Jeunesses Communistes de France) and the UJFF 
(Union des Jeunes Filles Françaises) distribute a leaflet in a number of <i>
lycées</i>. <i>L'Humanité</i> quotes it approvingly:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"We protest against the police violence unleashed against the 
students. We demand the reopening of Nanterre and of the Sorbonne and the 
liberation of all those arrested. We denounce the Gaullist power as being mainly 
[!] responsible for this situation. We also denounce the adventurism of certain 
irresponsible groups and call on the <i>lycéens</i> to fight side by side with 
the working class and its Communist Party ..."</p>

<h4><a name="h17">Monday, May 13</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Over the weekend Pompidou has climbed down. But the unions, the 
UNEF and the teachers have decided to maintain their call for a one-day, general 
strike. On its front page <i>L'Humanité</i> publishes, in enormous headlines, a 
call for the 24-hour strike followed by a statement from the Political Bureau:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The unity of the working class and of the students threatens 
the regime ... This creates an enormous problem. It is essential that no 
provocation, no diversion should be allowed to divert any of the forces 
struggling against the regime or should give the government the flimsiest 
pretext to distort the meaning of this great fight. The Communist Party 
associates itself without reservation with the just struggle of the students 
..."</p>

<h4><a name="h18">Wednesday, May 15</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The enormous Monday demonstrations in Paris and other towns - 
which incidentally prevented <i>L'Humanité</i> as well as other papers from 
appearing on the Tuesday - were a tremendous success. In a sense they triggered 
off the "spontaneous" wave of strikes which followed within a day or two. <i>
L'Humanité</i> publishes, on its front pages a statement issued the day before 
by the Party's Political Bureau. After taking all the credit for May 13th, the 
statement continues:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The People of Paris marched for hours in the streets of the 
capital showing a power which made any provocation impossible. The Party 
organizations worked day and night to ensure that this great demonstration of 
workers, teachers and students should take place in maximum unity, strength and 
discipline ... It is now clear that the Establishment confronted with the 
protests and collective action of all the main sections of the population, will 
seek to divide us in the hope of beating us. It will resort to all methods, 
including provocation. The Political Bureau warns workers and students against 
any adventurist endeavours which might, in the present circumstances, dislocate 
the broad front of the struggle which is in the process of developing, and 
provide the Gaullist power with an unexpected weapon with which to consolidate 
its shaky rule ..."</p>

<h4><a name="h19">Saturday, May 18</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Over the past 48 hours strikes with factory occupations have 
spread like a trail of gunpowder, from one corner of the country to the other. 
The railways are paralyzed, civil airports fly the red flag. ("Provocateurs" 
have obviously been at work!) <i>L'Humanité</i> publishes on its front page a 
declaration from the National Committee of the CGT:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"From hour to hour strikes and factory occupations are 
spreading. This action, started on the initiative of the CGT and of other 
trade-union organizations [<i>sic</i>!], creates a new situation of exceptional 
importance ... Long accumulated popular discontent is now finding expression. 
The questions being asked must be answered seriously and full notice taken of 
their importance. The evolution of the situation is giving a new dimension to 
the struggle ... While multiplying its efforts to raise the struggle to the 
needed level, the National Committee warns all CGT militants and local groups 
against any attempts by outside groups to meddle in the conduct of the struggle, 
and against all acts of provocation which might assist the forces of repression 
in their attempts to thwart the development of the movement ..."</p>

<p class="fst">The same issue of the paper devoted a whole page to warning 
students of the fallacy of any notions of "student power" - en passant 
attributing to the Mouvement du 22 Mars a whole series of political positions 
they had never held.</p>

<h4><a name="h20">Monday, May 20</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The whole country is totally paralyzed. The Communist Party is 
still warning about "provocations". The top right hand corner of <i>L'Humanité</i> 
contains a box labelled "WARNING":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Leaflets have been distributed in the Paris area calling for 
an insurrectionary general strike. It goes without saying that such appeals have 
not been issued by our democratic trade union organizations [it does indeed - 
MB]. They are the work of provocateurs seeking to provide the government with a 
pretext for intervention ... The workers must be vigilant to defeat all such 
manoeuvres ..."</p>

<p class="fst">In the same issue, Etienne Fajon, of the Central Committee, 
continues the warnings:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The Establishment's main preoccupation at the moment is to 
divide the ranks of the working class and to divide it from other sections of 
the population ... Our Political Bureau has warned workers and students, from 
the very beginning, against venturing slogans capable of dislocating the broad 
front of the struggle. Several provocations have thus been prevented. Our 
political vigilance must clearly be maintained ..."</p>

<p class="fst">The same issue devoted its central pages to an interview of M. 
Georges Séguy, general secretary of the CGT, conducted over the Europe No 1 
radio network. In these live interviews, various listeners phoned questions in 
directly. The following exchanges are worth recording:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"<i>Question</i>. M. Séguy, the workers on strike are 
everywhere saying that they will go the whole hog. What do you mean by this? 
What are your objectives?</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Answer</i>. The strike is so powerful that the workers 
obviously mean to obtain the maximum concessions at the end of such a movement. 
The whole hog for us, trade unionists, means winning the demands that we have 
always fought for, but which the government and the employers have always 
refused to consider. They have opposed an obtuse intransigence to the proposals 
for negotiations which we have repeatedly made.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The whole hog means a general rise in wages (no wages less 
than 600 francs per month), guaranteed employment, an earlier retirement age, 
reduction of working hours without loss of wages, and the defence and extension 
of trade-union rights within the factory. I am not putting these demands in any 
particular order because we attach the same importance to all of them.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Question</i>. If I am not mistaken the statutes of the CGT 
declare its aims to be the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement by 
socialism. In the present circumstances, that you have yourself referred to as 
'exceptional' and 'important', why doesn't the CGT seize this unique chance of 
calling for its fundamental objectives?</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Answer</i>. This is a very interesting question. I like it 
very much. It is true that the CGT offers the workers a concept of trade 
unionism that we consider the most revolutionary insofar as its final objective 
is the end of the employing class and of wage labour. It is true that this is 
the first of our statutes. It remains fundamentally the CGT'S objective. But can 
the present movement reach this objective? If it became obvious that it could, 
we would be ready to assume our responsibilities. It remains to be seen whether 
all the social strata involved in the present movement are ready to go that far.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Question</i>. Since last week's events I have gone 
everywhere where people are arguing. I went this afternoon to the Odeon Theatre. 
Masses of people were discussing there. I can assure you that all the classes 
who suffer from the present regime were represented there. When I asked whether 
people thought that the movement should go further than the small demands put 
forward by the trade unions for the last ten or twenty years, I brought the 
house down. I therefore think that it would be criminal to miss the present 
opportunity. It would be criminal because sooner or later this will have to be 
done. The conditions of today might allow us to do it peacefully and calmly and 
will perhaps never come back. I think this call must be made by you and the 
other political organizations. These political organizations are not your 
business, of course, but the CGT is a revolutionary organization. You must bring 
out your revolutionary flag. The workers are astounded to see you so timid.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Answer</i>. While you were bathing in the Odéon fever, I 
was in the factories. Amongst workers. I assure you that the answer I am giving 
you is the answer of a leader of a great trade union, which claims to have 
assumed all its responsibilities, but which does not confuse its wishes with 
reality.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>A caller</i>. I would like to speak to M. Séguy. My name is 
Duvauchel. I am the director of the Sud Aviation factory at Nantes.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Séguy</i>. Good morning, sir.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Duvauchel</i>. Good morning, Mr General Secretary. I would 
like to know what you think of the fact that for the last four days I have been 
sequestrated, together with about twenty other managerial staff, inside the Sud 
Aviation factory at Nantes.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Séguy</i>. Has anyone raised a hand against you?</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Duvauchel</i>. No. But I am prevented from leaving, despite 
the fact that the general manager of the firm has intimated that the firm was 
prepared to make positive proposals as soon as free access to its factory could 
be resumed, and first of all to its managerial staff.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Séguy</i>. Have you asked to leave the factory?</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Duvauchel</i>. Yes!</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Séguy</i>. Was permission refused?</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Duvauchel</i>. Yes!</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Séguy</i>. Then I must refer you to the declaration I made 
yesterday at the CGT'S press conference. I stated that I disapproved of such 
activities. We are taking the necessary steps to see they are not repeated."</p>

<p class="fst">But enough is enough. The Revolution itself will doubtless be 
denounced by the Stalinists as a provocation! By way of an epilogue it is worth 
recording that at a packed meeting of revolutionary students, held at the 
Mutualité on Thursday, May 9th, a spokesman of the (Trotskyist) Organisation 
Communiste Internationaliste could think of nothing better to do than call on 
the meeting to pass a resolution calling on Séguy to call a general strike!!!</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<h2><a name="h21">France, 1968</a></h2>

<p class="fst">This has undoubtedly been the greatest revolutionary upheaval in 
Western Europe since the days of the Paris Commune. Hundreds of thousands of 
students have fought pitched battles with the police. Nine million workers have 
been on strike. The red flag of revolt has flown over occupied factories, 
universities, building sites, shipyards, primary and secondary schools, 
pitheads, railway stations, department stores, docked transatlantic liners, 
theatres, hotels. The Paris Opéra, the Folies Bergères and the building of the 
National Council for Scientific Research were taken over, as were the 
headquarters of the French Football Federation - whose aim was clearly perceived 
as being "to prevent ordinary footballers enjoying football".</p>

<p class="fst">Virtually every layer of French society has been involved to some 
extent or other. Hundreds of thousands of people of all ages have discussed 
every aspect of life in packed-out, non-stop meetings in every available 
schoolroom and lecture hall. Boys of fourteen have invaded a primary school for 
girls shouting "<i>Liberté pour les filles</i>". Even such traditionally 
reactionary enclaves as the Faculties of Medicine and Law have been shaken from 
top to bottom, their hallowed procedures and institutions challenged and found 
wanting. Millions have taken a hand in making history. This is the stuff of 
revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Under the influence of the revolutionary students, thousands 
began to query the whole principle of hierarchy. The students had questioned it 
where it seemed the most "natural": in the realms of teaching and knowledge. 
They proclaimed that democratic self-management was possible - and to prove it 
began to practice it themselves. They denounced the monopoly of information and 
produced millions of leaflets to break it. They attacked some of the main 
pillars of contemporary "civilization": the barriers between manual workers and 
intellectuals, the consumer society, the "sanctity" of the university and of 
other founts of capitalist culture and wisdom.</p>

<p class="fst">Within a matter of days the tremendous creative potentialities of 
the people suddenly erupted. The boldest and most realistic ideas - and they are 
usually the same - were advocated, argued, applied. Language, rendered stale by 
decades of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo, eviscerated by those who manipulate it for 
advertizing purposes, suddenly reappeared as something new and fresh. People 
re-appropriated it in all its fullness. Magnificently apposite and poetic 
slogans emerged from the anonymous crowd. Children explained to their elders 
what the function of education should be. The educators were educated. Within a 
few days, young people of twenty attained a level of understanding and a 
political and tactical sense which many who had been in the revolutionary 
movement for thirty years or more were still sadly lacking.</p>

<p class="fst">The tumultuous development of the students struggle triggered off 
the first factory occupations. It transformed both the relation of forces in 
society and the image, in people's minds, of established institutions and of 
established leaders. It compelled the State to reveal both its oppressive nature 
and its fundamental incoherence. It exposed the utter emptiness of Government, 
Parliament, Administration - and of <i>all</i> the political parties. Unarmed 
students had forced the Establishment to drop its mask, to sweat with fear, to 
resort to the police club and to the gas grenade. Students finally compelled the 
bureaucratic leaderships of the "working-class organizations" to reveal 
themselves as the ultimate custodians of the established order.</p>

<p class="fst">But the revolutionary movement did still more. It fought its 
battles in Paris, not in some underdeveloped country, exploited by imperialism. 
In a glorious few weeks the actions of students and young workers dispelled the 
myth of the well-organized, well-oiled modern capitalist society, from which 
radical conflict had been eliminated and in which only marginal problems 
remained to be solved. Administrators who had been administering everything were 
suddenly shown to have had a grasp of nothing. Planners who had planned 
everything showed themselves incapable of ensuring the endorsement of their 
plans by those to whom they applied. This most modern movement should allow real 
revolutionaries to shed a number of the ideological encumbrances which in the 
past had hampered revolutionary activity. It wasn't hunger which drove the 
students to revolt. There wasn't an "economic crisis" even in the loosest sense 
of the term. The revolt had nothing to do with "under-consumption" or with 
"over-production". The "falling rate of profit" just didn't come into the 
picture. Moreover, the student movement wasn't based on economic demands. On the 
contrary, the movement only found its real stature, and only evoked its 
tremendous response, when it went beyond the economic demands within which 
official student unionism had for so long sought to contain it (incidentally 
with the blessing of all the political parties and "revolutionary" groups of the 
"Left"). And conversely it was by confining the workers' struggle to purely 
economic objectives that the trade union bureaucrats have so far succeeded in 
coming to the assistance of the regime.</p>

<p class="fst">The present movement has shown that the fundamental contradiction 
of modern bureaucratic capitalism isn't the "anarchy of the market". It isn't 
the "contradiction between the forces of production and the property relations". 
The central conflict to which all others are related is the conflict between 
order-givers (<i>dirigeants</i>) and order-takers (<i>éxécutants</i>). The 
insoluble contradiction which tears the guts out of modern capitalist society is 
the one which compels it to exclude people from the management of their own 
activities and which at the same time compels it to solicit their participation, 
without which it would collapse. These tendencies find expression on the one 
hand in the attempt of the bureaucrats to convert men into objects (by violence, 
mystification, new manipulation techniques - or "economic" carrots) and, on the 
other hand, in mankind's refusal to allow itself to be treated in this way.</p>

<p class="fst">The French events show clearly something that all revolutions 
have shown, but which apparently has again and again to be learned anew. There 
is no "inbuilt revolutionary perspective", no "gradual increase of 
contradictions", no "progressive development of a revolutionary mass 
consciousness". What are given are the contradictions and the conflicts we have 
described and the fact that modern bureaucratic society more or less inevitably 
produces periodic "accidents" which disrupt its functioning. These both provoke 
popular intervention and provide the people with opportunities for asserting 
themselves and for changing the social order. The functioning of bureaucratic 
capitalism creates the conditions within which revolutionary consciousness may 
appear. These conditions are an integral part of the whole alienating 
hierarchical and oppressive social structure. Whenever people struggle, sooner 
or later they are compelled to question the whole of that social structure.</p>

<p class="fst">These are ideas which many of us in Solidarity have long 
subscribed to. They were developed at length in some of Paul Cardan's pamphlets. 
Writing in <i>Le Monde</i> (May 20, 1968) E. Morin admits that what is happening 
today in France is "a blinding resurrection: the resurrection of that 
libertarian strand which seeks concilation with Marxism, in a formula of which <i>
Socialisme ou Barbarie</i> had provided a first synthesis a few years ago ..." 
As after every verification of basic concepts in the crucible of real events, 
many will proclaim that these had always been their views. This, of course isn't 
true.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> The point however isn't to 
lay claims to a kind of copyright in the realm of correct revolutionary ideas. 
We welcome converts, from whatever sources and however belated.</p>

<p class="fst">We can't deal here at length with what is now an important 
problem in France, namely the creation of a new kind of revolutionary movement. 
Things would indeed have been different if such a movement had existed, strong 
enough to outwit the bureaucratic manoeuvres, alert enough day by day to expose 
the duplicity of the "left" leaderships, deeply enough implanted to explain to 
the workers the real meaning of the students' struggle, to propagate the idea of 
autonomous strike committees (linking up union and non-union members), of 
workers' management of production and of Workers' Councils. Many things which 
could have been done weren't done because there wasn't such a movement. The way 
the students' own struggle was unleashed shows that such an organization could 
have played a most important catalytic role without automatically becoming a 
bureaucratic "leadership". But such regrets are futile. The non-existence of 
such a movement is no accident. If it <i>had</i> been formed during the previous 
period it certainly wouldn't have been the kind of movement of which we are 
speaking. Even taking the "best" of the small organizations - and multiplying 
its numbers a hundredfold - wouldn't have met the requirements of the current 
situation. When confronted with the test of events all the "left" groups just 
continued playing their old gramophone records. Whatever their merits as 
depositories of the cold ashes of the revolution - a task they have now carried 
out for several decades - they proved incapable of snapping out of their old 
ideas and routines, incapable of learning or of forgetting anything.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The new revolutionary movement will have to be built from the new 
elements (students and workers) who have understood the real significance of 
current events. The revolution must step into the great political void revealed 
by the crisis of the old society. It must develop a voice, a face, a paper - and 
it must do it soon.</p>

<p class="fst">We can understand the reluctance of some students to form such an 
organization. They feel there is a contradiction between action and thought, 
between spontaneity and organization. Their hesitation is fed by the whole of 
their previous experience. They have seen how thought could become sterilizing 
dogma, organization become bureaucracy or lifeless ritual, speech become a means 
of mystification, a revolutionary idea become a rigid and stereotyped programme. 
Through their actions, their boldness, their reluctance to consider long-term 
aims, they had broken out of this straightjacket. But this isn't enough.</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover many of them had sampled the traditional "left" groups. 
In all their fundamental aspects these groups remain trapped within the 
ideological and organizational frameworks of bureaucratic capitalism. They have 
programmes fixed once and for all, leaders who utter fixed speeches, whatever 
the changing reality around them, organizational forms which mirror those of 
existing society. Such groups reproduce within their own ranks the division 
between order-takers and order-givers, between those who "know" and those who 
don't, the separation between scholastic pseudo-theory and real life. They would 
even like to impose this division into the working class, whom they all aspire 
to lead, because (and I was told this again and again) "the workers are only 
capable of developing a trade-union consciousness".</p>

<p class="fst">But these students are wrong. One doesn't get beyond bureaucratic 
organization by denying all organization. One doesn't challenge the sterile 
rigidity of finished programmes by refusing to define oneself in terms of aims 
and methods. One doesn't refute dead dogma by the condemnation of all 
theoretical reflection. The students and young workers can't just stay where 
they are. To accept these "contradictions" as valid and as something which 
cannot be transcended is to accept the essence of bureaucratic capitalist 
ideology. It is to accept the prevailing philosophy and the prevailing reality. 
It is to integrate the revolution into an established historical order.</p>

<p class="fst">If the revolution is only an explosion lasting a few days (or 
weeks), the established order - whether it knows it or not - will be able to 
cope. What is more - at a deep level - class society even needs such jolts. This 
kind of "revolution" permits class society to survive by compelling it to 
transform and adapt itself. This is the real danger today. Explosions which 
disrupt the imaginary world in which alienated societies tend to live - and 
bring them momentarily down to earth - help them eliminate outmoded methods of 
domination and evolve new and more flexible ones.</p>

<p class="fst">Action or thought? For revolutionary socialists the problem is 
not to make a synthesis of these two preoccupations of the revolutionary 
students. It is to destroy the social context in which such false alternatives 
find root.</p>

<h3><a name="h23">Notes:</a></h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1]</a> Compagnie Républicaine de 
Sécurité - the riot police.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n2" href="#fn2">[2]</a> Parti Socialiste Unifié - 
left-wing socialist party.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> Confédération Générale du 
Travail - the Communist trade-union federation.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n4" href="#fn4">[4]</a> Confédération Française 
Démocratique du Travail - the Socialist trade-union federation.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n5" href="#fn5">[5]</a> Force Ouvrière - 
"non-political" trade-union organization.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> We recall for instance a 
long review of <i>Modern Capitalism and Revolution</i> in <i>International 
Socialism</i> (no. 22) where, under the heading "Return to Utopia", Cardan was 
deemed to have "nothing to say in relation to theory". His prediction that 
people would eventually reject the emptiness of the consumer society were 
described as "mere moralizing" and as "doing credit to a Christian ascetic". The 
authors should perhaps visit the new monastery at the Sorbonne.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a> We are not primarily 
referring to Trotskyist groups such as the FER, which on the night of the 
barricades, despite repeated appeals for help, refused to cancel their mass 
meeting at the Mutualité or to send reinforcements to assist students and 
workers already engaged in a bitter fight with the CRS on the barricades of the 
Rue Gay-Lussac. We are not referring to their leader Chisseray who claimed it 
was "necessary above all to preserve the revolutionary vanguard from an 
unnecessary massacre". Nor are we referring to the repeated Maoist criticisms of 
the students' struggle, uttered as late as May 7th. What we are referring to is 
the inability of any Trotskyist or Maoist group to raise the real issues 
demanded in a revolutionary situation, i.e. to call for workers' management of 
production and the formation of Workers' Councils. None of these groups even 
touched on the sort of questions the revolutionary students were touching on day 
and night: the relations of production in the capitalist factory, alienation at 
work whatever the level of wages, the division between leaders and led within 
the factory hierarchy or within the "working-class" organizations themselves. 
All that <i>Humanité Nouvelle</i> could counterpoise to the constantly 
demobilizing activities of the CGT was the immensely demystifying slogan, "<i>Vive 
la CGT</i>" (The CGT isn't <i>really</i> what it appears to be, comrade".) All 
that <i>Voix Ouvrière</i> could counterpoise to the CGT's demand for a minimum 
wage of 600 francs was ... a minimum wage of 1,000 francs. This kind of 
revolutionary auction (in purely economic demands), after the workers had been 
occupying the factories for a number of weeks, shows the utter bankruptcy of 
revolutionaries who fail to recognize a revolution. <i>
Avant-Garde</i> correctly attacked some of the ambiguities of <i>autogestion</i> 
(self-management) as advocated by the CFDT, but failed to point out the deeply 
revolutionary implications of the slogan.</p>
