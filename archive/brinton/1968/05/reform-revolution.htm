<p class="fst">French bourgeois society is today being rocked to its 
foundations. Ten million workers are on strike. Factories, building sites, 
shipyards, shops, schools and universities have been taken over by those who 
work there. The whole transport system is at a standstill. The red flag has been 
hoisted over railway stations and state theatres, pitheads and sedate 
educational establishments. Tens of thousands of people of all ages are 
discussing every aspect of life in packed-out, non-stop meetings in every 
available schoolroom and lecture hall. Even the peasants are moving driving 
their tractors into the market places of country towns and challenging the 
authorities. The police force is vacillating. Even the "elite" paramilitary 
formations of the bourgeois state - the CRS - are being subjected to repeated 
drubbings in the streets.</p>

<p class="fst">No one "called" for this general strike. No one foresaw this 
tremendous upsurge of the masses, which caught all the traditional organizations 
of the "left" with their pants down. The pent-up criticism, anger, resentment 
and frustration of millions of young people against a society which treated them 
as objects is exploding in the greatest challenge to established French society 
since the days of the Paris Commune.</p>

<p class="fst">In the circumstances, the demands put forward by different 
sections of the French "left" are most revealing. The bourgeois politicians can 
see no further than a ministerial reshuffle. They are prepared to sacrifice a 
few big names in order to canalize the movement back into safe, parliamentary 
channels. Their game is so obvious that no one is likely to be fooled by it. As 
for the Socialist Party (SFIO), it is utterly discredited by years of 
opportunist and class-collaborationist policies. After all, it was a "socialist" 
Minister of the Interior, Jules Moch, who created the hated CRS. When the 
million-strong demonstration marched past the SFIO headquarters on the Boulevard 
de Magenta, on May 13, they shouted "Guy Mollet, to the museum".</p>

<p class="fst">The Communist Party and the CGT have been dragged into a tornado 
which they had not foreseen, do not understand, and whose development has 
constantly escaped their control. From the outset they have been more concerned 
about being outflanked on the left than in developing this tremendous mass 
movement. During the last three weeks every issue of <i>L'Humanité</i> has 
contained denunciations of the students and warnings against "provocateurs", 
"irresponsible elements", "anarchists" and "Trotskyists". (The bourgeois press 
speaks much the same language.) The Communists refer to Cohn-Bendit, one of the 
student leaders, as an agent of the CIA (while Prime Minister Pompidou hints 
that he is an agent of the Chinese). It seems beyond their combined 
comprehension that he might be what he claims to be: an "agent" of the Nanterre 
students.</p>

<p class="fst">The demands put forward by the CGT are very limited ones: a wage 
increase, a shortening of the working week, a lowering of the retiring age, the 
abolition of charges recently imposed on social security benefits, and the 
recognition of trade union organization in the factories. These demands are 
perfectly legitimate and justified, but also perfectly compatible with the 
continued rule of the bourgeoisie. Yet it is precisely this rule which the 
advanced sections of the workers and students are prepared to challenge. None of 
the industrial demands put forward by the CGT is in any way revolutionary. Even 
if granted, the ruling class could take everything back tomorrow through 
inflation or devaluation.</p>

<p class="fst">At the political level, the Communist Party sees no further than 
the replacement of the Gaullist regime by a "popular front" led by Mitterand, in 
which the CP would be "adequately" represented. At a time when every social 
institution (from the <i>lycées</i> to the Football Federation, from managerial 
authority in the factories to Parliament itself) is being questioned and 
challenged, the Communist Party can see no further than a reshuffle of seats in 
the Palais Bourbon.</p>

<p class="fst">The present movement started earlier this year at Nanterre, near 
Paris, when groups of students decided to challenge the central assumptions of 
bourgeois education by direct action methods (interruption of lectures, holding 
political meetings on the campus, etc.). They proclaimed that they rejected the 
whole hierarchical structure of the university, its selection and examination 
procedures, its administrative methods and more especially its function as a 
provider of industrial sociologists and psychologists whose purpose in life 
would be to help control and manipulate the working class. Confronted with this 
quite deliberate and openly admitted "provocation", the state authorities 
committed one bureaucratic blunder after another, each of which was to permit 
the student movement to take another leap forward. The police were eventually 
called into the faculties, thus provoking the total and irrevocable disaffection 
of the whole student community.</p>

<p class="fst">None of the traditional parties has really grasped what the 
students were after ... or rather they grasp it only too well. None are prepared 
to face the implications of the student challenge - namely that to explode the 
class basis of the university is to present established society with an 
intolerable threat. That is why the Communist Party still talks about the 
"student agitation" in terms of "bigger educational budgets", "more teachers", 
"better facilities", etc, instead of describing its real and profoundly 
revolutionary content.</p>

<p class="fst">This also explains why every attempt by the revolutionary 
students to link up with rank-and-file workers now occupying the factories is 
being strenuously and often physically opposed by the CGT apparatus. The 
students are talking about workers' power, about a free society, things which 
the bureaucrats do not want the workers to think too much about. At Nantes, a 
student delegation from Paris, sent to establish contact with an occupied 
factory, was handed over to the police by a group of CGT pickets who happened to 
be Stalinist hacks. These attempts at dividing the movement, successful at 
first, are beginning to break down as the students show, in action, their 
militancy and their readiness to pursue the struggle to the bitter end.</p>

<p class="fst">It is this student militancy which terrifies every conservative 
layer of French society, from the readers of the <i>Figaro</i> to the elderly 
functionaries of the CGT. The students have shown that Gaullism is not 
omnipotent, that it is possible to fight back against the oppressive apparatus 
of the bourgeois state, and that it is possible to pass from a critique of 
bourgeois education to a total critique, in action, of the capitalist state.</p>

<p class="fst">Alone, of course, the students cannot change society. But student 
militancy has triggered off a massive working class response, compounded of 
sympathy, hatred of the police, and the advocacy of their own specific demands. 
The fate of the revolution now hinges on an unanswerable, yet all important 
question. Will the workers' objectives remain confined to improvements <i>within</i> 
the system? Or will they, like the students, take up the struggle on a much 
broader front? Will they eventually struggle against modern bureaucratic 
capitalist society, in all its multiple manifestations? Only if the workers 
undertake this far more difficult fight, a fight which no one can wage for them, 
a fight which implies a ruthless struggle against "their own" organizations, 
will the revolution be successful in any real sense. Only on the basis of such a 
struggle will it become impossible for various bureaucratic leaderships to take 
the movement in hand again, and lead it up a blind alley.</p>

<p class="fst">What of the other groups, to the left of the Communist Party? At 
a time when everything is still possible, when more and more people are 
realizing that the future will only contain what people put into it now, the 
imagination of many self-styled "revolutionaries" remains caught up in the 
bureaucratic thinking of a previous epoch.</p>

<p class="fst">The various Trotskyist groups fail to see the tremendous 
potentialities of the situation. Their main preoccupation is to establish <i>
their</i> leadership over the mass movement. They all say that what is missing 
is the Party (which they all interpret as their particular party). None of them 
have confidence in the ability of the workers or students to solve their 
problems without this kind of tutelage. Some call for the Communists to take 
power (just as in this country they asked you to vote Labour at the last 
election) in order to "take the masses through the experience". Their economic 
demands only differ quantitatively from the Stalinist ones. They all engage in a 
kind of revolutionary auction. For instance, <i>Voix Ouvrière</i> advocates a 
minimum monthly wage of 1000 new francs, instead of the 600 new francs advocated 
by the CGT.</p>

<p class="fst">Trotskyist groups such as the FER (Fédération des Etudiants 
Révolutionnaires) are calling for organizational measures such as the setting up 
of a hierarchy of strike committees (with a national strike committee at the 
top) representing the various strike-bound factories and enterprises. Given the 
present relationship of forces, the Stalinists would be in an overwhelming 
majority on such bodies. The idea is to "expose" the Stalinists, should they 
seek to liquidate the strike in exchange for financial concessions from the 
employers or parliamentary concessions from the bourgeois state. From this 
"exposure", the Trotskyists hope to benefit. The incalculable damage done to the 
working class in the process is dismissed as an inevitable overhead.</p>

<p class="fst">The practical acts of the Trotskyists have proved equally 
nefarious. On the "night of the barricades" (May 10, 1968), despite repeated 
appeals for help, the FER refused to cancel its mass meeting at the Mutualite 
and to send reinforcements to assist the students and workers who were already 
engaged in a bitter fight with the CRS, on the barricades of the Rue Gay-Lussac, 
hardly a mile away. When several hundred FER members and sympathisers eventually 
turned up at 1.00 am, it was only to advise students to disperse. In the words 
of Chisseray, one of the Trotskyist "leaders", it was "necessary above all to 
preserve the revolutionary vanguard from an unnecessary massacre". The fact has 
been widely discussed in the mass assemblies, held night after night in the 
packed amphitheatres of Censier and La Sorbonne. Thousands are undergoing an 
extremely rapid education, through practice, as to the nature of Stalinism and 
Trotskyism and how they both seek to manipulate the mass movement in their own 
respective interests.</p>

<p class="fst">At first only a handful of revolutionary socialists and 
anarchists appreciated the tremendous opportunities now opening up. These 
groups, which are tending more and more to get together, are talking in terms of 
a <i>total</i> social revolution, of workers' management of production (<i>autogestion</i>) 
and of the need for workers' councils. In fact this radical viewpoint now 
presents the traditional left with the most widely-based challenge it has ever 
had to face. On the initiative of the revolutionaries, hundreds of <i>Comités 
d'action</i> have been set up in various factories and districts of Paris and 
other large towns. These committees consist of workers and students, agreed upon 
a programme of direct action in a given locality or enterprise and who also see 
the need to develop the mass movement as quickly, widely and radically as 
possible. Their activities are already getting an enthusiastic response, not 
only among wide layers of the student population but among smaller layers of 
young workers. If and when the working class as a whole itself takes up these 
demands (and gives them flesh and blood) the door will at least be open for a 
total, final challenge to French capitalist society, a challenge it will no 
longer be able to contain.</p>
