<hr>

<p class="fst">The fiftieth anniversary of the Russian Revolution will be 
assessed, analyzed, celebrated or bemoaned in a variety of ways.</p>

<p class="fst">To the peddlers of religious mysticism and to the advocates of 
"freedom of enterprise", Svetlana Stalin's sensational (and well-timed) 
defection will "prove" the resilience of their respective doctrines, now shown as 
capable of sprouting on what at first sight would appear rather barren soil.</p>

<p class="fst">To incorrigible liberals, the recent, cautious reintroduction of 
the profit motive into certain sectors of the Russian economy will "prove" that 
laissez-faire economics is synonymous with human nature and that a rationally 
planned economy was always a pious pipe-dream.</p>

<p class="fst">To those "lefts" (like the late Isaac Deutscher) who saw in 
Russia's industrialization an automatic guarantee of more liberal attitudes in 
days to come, the imprisonment of Daniel and Sinyavsky for thought-crime (and 
the current persecution of those who stood up for them) will have come as a 
resounding slap in the face.</p>

<p class="fst">To the "Marxist-Leninists" of China (and Albania), Russia's 
rapprochement with the USA, her passivity in the recent Middle East crisis, her 
signing of the Test Ban Treaty and her reactionary influence on revolutionary 
developments in the colonial countries will all bear testimony to her headlong 
slither into the swamp of revisionism, following the Great Stalin's death. 
(Stalin, it will be remembered, was the architect of such revolutionary, 
non-revisionist, measures as the elimination of the Old Bolsheviks, the Moscow 
Trials, the Popular Front, the Nazi-Soviet Pact, the Teheran and Yalta 
Agreements and the dynamic struggles of the French and Italian Communist Parties 
in the immediate post-war years, struggles which led to their direct seizure of 
power in their respective countries.)</p>

<p class="fst">To the Yugoslavs, reintegrated at last after their adolescent 
wandering from the fold, the re-emergence of "sanity" in Moscow will be seen as 
corroboration of their worst suspicions. The 1948 "troubles" were clearly all 
due to the machinations of the wicked Beria. Mihajlo Mihajlov now succeeds 
Djilas behind the bars of a people's prison ... just to remind political 
heretics that, in Yugoslavia too, "proletarian democracy" is confined to those 
who refrain from asking awkward questions.</p>

<p class="fst">To the Trotskyists of all ilk - at least to those still capable 
of thinking for themselves - the mere fact of the fiftieth anniversary 
celebrations should be food for thought. What do words mean? How "transitional" 
can a transitional society be? Aren't four decades of "Bonapartism" in danger of 
making the word a trifle meaningless? Like the unflinching Christians carrying 
their cross, will unflinching Trotskyists go on carrying their question mark 
(concerning the future evolution of Russian society) for the rest of their 
earthly existence? For how much longer will they go on gargling with the old 
slogans of "capitalist restoration or advance towards socialism" proposed by 
their mentor in his <i>Revolution Betrayed</i> ... thirty years ago! Surely only 
the blind can now fail to see that Russia is a class society of a new type, and 
has been for several decades.</p>

<p class="fst">Those who have shed these mystifications - or who have never been 
blinded by them - will see things differently. They will sense that there can be 
no vestige of socialism in a society whose rulers can physically annihilate the 
Hungarian Workers' Councils, denounce equalitarianism and workers' management of 
production as "petty-bourgeois" or "anarcho-syndicalist" deviations, and accept 
the cold-blooded murder of a whole generation of revolutionaries as mere 
"violations of socialist legality", to be rectified - oh so gingerly and 
tactfully - by the technique of "selective posthumous rehabilitation". It will 
be obvious to them that something went seriously wrong with the Russian 
Revolution. <i>What was it? And when did the "degeneration" start?</i></p>

<p class="fst">Here again the answers differ. For some the "excesses" or 
"mistakes" are attributable to a spiteful paranoia slowly sneaking up on the 
senescent Stalin. This interpretation (apart from tacitly accepting the very 
"cult of the individual" which its advocates would claim to decry) fails, 
however, to account for the repressions of revolutionaries and the conciliations 
with imperialism perpetrated at a much earlier period. For others the 
"degeneration" set in with the final defeat of the Left Opposition as an 
organized force (1927), or with Lenin's death (1924), or with the abolition of 
factions at the tenth Party Congress (1921). For the Bordigists the proclamation 
of the New Economic Policy (1921) irrevocably stamped Russia as "state 
capitalist". Others, rightly rejecting this preoccupation with the minutiae of 
revolutionary chronometry, stress more general factors, albeit in our opinion 
some of the less important ones.</p>

<p class="fst">Our purpose in publishing this text about the Kronstadt events of 
1921 is not to draw up an alternative timetable. Nor are we looking for 
political ancestors. The construction of an orthodox apostolic succession is the 
least of our preoccupations. (In a constantly changing world it would only 
testify to our theoretical sterility.) Our occupation is simply to document some 
of the real - but less well-known - struggles that took place against the 
growing bureaucracy during the early post-revolutionary years, at a time when 
most of the later critics of the bureaucracy were part and parcel of the 
apparatus itself.</p>

<p class="fst">The fiftieth anniversary of the Russian Revolution presents us 
with the absurd sight of a Russian ruling class (which every day resembles more 
its Western counterpart) solemnly celebrating the revolution which overthrew 
bourgeois power and allowed the masses, for a brief moment, to envisage a 
totally new kind of social order.</p>

<p class="fst">What made this tragic paradox possible? What shattered this 
vision? How did the Revolution degenerate?</p>

<p class="fst">Many explanations are offered. The history of how the Russian 
working class was dispossessed is not, however, a matter for an esoteric 
discussion among political cliques, who compensate for their own irrelevance by 
mental journeys into the enchanted world of the revolutionary past. An 
understanding of what took place is essential for every serious socialist. It is 
not mere archivism.</p>

<p class="fst">No viable ruling class rules by force alone. To rule it must 
succeed in getting its own vision of reality accepted by society at large. The 
concepts by which it attempts to legitimize its rule must be projected into the 
past. Socialists have correctly recognized that the history taught in bourgeois 
schools reveals a particular, distorted, vision of the world. It is a measure of 
the weakness of the revolutionary movement that <i>socialist</i> history remains 
for the most part unwritten.</p>

<p class="fst">What passes as socialist history is often only a mirror image of 
bourgeois historiography, a percolation into the ranks of the working class 
movement of typically bourgeois methods of thinking. In the world of this type 
of "historian" leaders of genius replace the kings and queens of the bourgeois 
world. Famous congresses, splits or controversies, the rise and fall of 
political parties or unions, the emergence or degeneration of this or that 
leadership replace the internecine battles of the rulers of the past. The masses 
never appear independently on the historical stage, making their own history. At 
best they only "supply the steam", enabling others to drive the locomotive, as 
Stalin so delicately put it.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Most of the time, 'official' historians don't have eyes to 
see or ears to hear the acts and words which express the workers' spontaneous 
activity ... They lack the categories of thought - one might even say the brain 
cells - necessary to understand or even to perceive this activity as it really 
is. To them an activity that has no leader or programme, no institutions and no 
statutes, can only be described as 'troubles' or 'disorders'. The spontaneous 
activity of the masses belongs by definition to what history suppresses."<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This tendency to identify working class history with the history 
of its organizations, institutions and leaders is not only inadequate - it 
reflects a typically bourgeois vision of mankind, divided in almost preordained 
manner between <i>the few</i> who will manage and decide, and the <i>many</i>, 
the malleable mass, incapable of acting consciously on its own behalf, and 
forever destined to remain the object (and never the subject) of history. Most 
histories of the degeneration of the Russian Revolution rarely amount to more 
than this.</p>

<p class="fst">The Stalinist bureaucracy was unique in that it presented a view 
of history based on outright lies rather than on the more usual mixture of 
subtle distortion and self-mystification. But Khrushchev's revelations and 
subsequent developments in Russia have caused official Russian versions of 
events (in all their variants) to be questioned even by members of the Communist 
Party. Even the graduates of what Trotsky called "the Stalin school of 
falsification" are now beginning to reject the lies of the Stalinist era. Our 
task is to take the process of demystification a little further.</p>

<p class="fst">Of all the interpretations of the degeneration of the Russian 
Revolution that of Issac Deutscher is the most widely accepted on the Left. It 
echoes most of the assumptions of the Trotskyists. Although an improvement on 
the Stalinist versions, it is hardly sufficient. The degeneration is seen as due 
to strictly conjunctural factors (the isolation of the revolution in a backward 
country, the devastation caused by the Civil War, the overwhelming weight of the 
peasantry, etc.). These factors are undoubtedly very important. But the growth 
of the bureaucracy is more than just an accident in history. It is a worldwide 
phenomenon, intimately linked to a certain stage in the development of working 
class consciousness. It is the terrible price paid by the working class for its 
delay in recognizing that the true and final emancipation of the working class 
can only be achieved by the working class itself, and cannot be entrusted to 
others, allegedly acting on its behalf. If "socialism is Man's total and 
positive self-consciousness" (Marx, 1844), the experience (and rejection) of the 
bureaucracy is a step on that road.</p>

<p class="fst">The Trotskyists deny that early oppositions to the developing 
bureaucracy had any revolutionary content. On the contrary they denounce the 
Workers' Opposition and the Kronstadt rebels as basically counter-revolutionary. 
Real opposition, for them, starts with the proclamation - within the Party - of 
the Left Opposition of 1923. But anyone in the least familiar with the period 
will know that by 1923 the working class had already sustained a decisive 
defeat. It had lost power in production to a group of managers appointed from 
above. It had also lost power in the Soviets, which were now only ghosts of 
their former selves, only a rubber stamp for the emerging bureaucracy. The Left Oppostion fought within the confines of the Party, which was itself already 
highly bureaucratized. No substantial number of workers rallied to its cause. 
Their will to struggle had been sapped by the long struggle of the preceding 
years.</p>

<p class="fst">Opposition to the anti-working-class measures being taken by the 
Bolshevik leadership in the years immediately following the revolution took many 
forms and expressed itself through many different channels and at many different 
levels. It expressed itself <i>within</i> the Party itself, through a number of 
oppositional tendencies of which the Workers' Opposition (Kollontai, Lutovinov, 
Shlyapnikov) is the best known.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
Outside the Party the revolutionary opposition found heterogenous expression, in 
the life of a number, often illegal groups (some anarchist, some 
anarcho-syndicalist, some still professing their basis faith in Marxism).<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> 
It also found expression in spontaneous, often "unorganized" class activity, 
such as the big Leningrad strikes of 1921 and the Kronstadt uprising. It found 
expression in the increasing resistance of the workers to Bolshevik industrial 
policy (and in particular to Trotsky's attempts to militarize the trade unions). 
It also found expression in proletarian opposition to Bolshevik attempts to 
evict all other tendencies from the Soviets, thus effectively gagging all those 
seeking to re-orient socialist construction along entirely different lines.</p>

<p class="fst">At an early stage several tendencies had struggled against the 
bureaucratic degeneration of the Revolution. By posthumously excluding them from 
the ranks of the revolutionary, Trotskyists, Leninists and others commit a 
double injustice. Firstly they excommunicate all those who foresaw and struggled 
against the nascent bureaucracy <i>prior to 1923</i>, thereby turning a deaf ear 
to some of the most pertinent and valid criticisms ever voiced against the 
bureaucracy. Secondly they weaken their own case, for if the demands for freely 
elected Soviets, for freedom of expression (proletarian democracy) and for 
workers' management of production were wrong in 1921, why did they become 
partially correct in 1923? Why are they correct now? If in 1921 Lenin and 
Trotsky represented the "real interests" of the workers (against the actual 
workers), why couldn't Stalin? Why couldn't Kadar in Hungary in 1956? The 
Trotskyist school of hagiography has helped to obscure the real lessons of the 
struggle against the bureaucracy.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<p class="sub">*</p>

<p class="fst">When one seriously studies the crucial years after 1917, when the 
fate of the Russian Revolution was still in the melting pot, one is driven again 
and again to the tragic events of the Kronstadt uprising of March 1921. These 
events epitomize, in a bloody and dramatic manner, the struggle between two 
concepts of the Revolution, two revolutionary methods, two types of 
revolutionary ethos. Who decides what is or is not in the long term interests of 
the working class? What methods are permissible in settling differences between 
revolutionaries? And what methods are double-edged and only capable in the long 
run of harming the Revolution itself?</p>

<p class="fst">There is remarkably little of a detailed nature available in 
English about the Kronstadt events. The Stalininst histories, revised and 
re-edited according to the fluctuating fortunes of Party functionaries, are not 
worth the paper they are written on. They are an insult to the intelligence of 
their readers, deemed incapable of comparing the same facts described in earlier 
and later editions of the same book.</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky's writings about Kronstadt are few and more concerned at 
retrospective justification and at scoring debating points against the 
Anarchists<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> than at seriously 
analyzing this particular episode of the Russian Revolution. Trotsky and the 
Trotskyists are particularly keen to perpetuate the myth that they were the 
first and only coherent anti-bureaucratic tendency. All their writings seek to 
hide how far the bureaucratization of both Party and Soviets had already gone by 
1921 - i.e. how far it had gone during the period when Lenin and Trotsky were in 
full and undisputed control. The task for serious revolutionaries today is to 
see the link between Trotsky's attitudes and pronouncements during and before 
the "great trade union debate" of 1920-21 and the healthy hostility to 
Trotskyism of the most advanced and revolutionary layers of the industrial 
working class. This hostility was to manifest itself -arms in hand - during the 
Kronstadt uprising. It was to manifest itself again two or three years later - 
this time by folded arms - when these advanced layers failed to rally to 
Trotsky's support, when he at last chose to challenge Stalin, within the limited 
confines of a Party machine, towards whose bureaucratization he had signally 
contributed.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Deutscher in <i>The Prophet Armed</i> vividly depicts the 
background of Russia during the years of Civil War, the suffering, the economic 
dislocation, the sheer physical exhaustion of the population. But the picture is 
one-sided, its purpose to stress that the "iron will of the Bolsheviks" was the 
only element of order, stability and continuity in a society that was hovering 
on the brink of total collapse. He pays scant attention to the attempts made by 
groups of workers and revolutionaries - both within the Party and outside its 
ranks - to attempt social reconstruction on an entirely different basis, from 
below.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> He does not discuss the 
sustained opposition and hostility of the Bolsheviks to workers' management of 
production<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> or in fact to any 
large-scale endeavour which escaped their domination or control. Of the 
Kronstadt events themselves, of the Bolshevik calumnies against Kronstadt and of 
the frenzied repression that followed the events of March 1921, Deutscher says 
next to nothing, except that the Bolshevik accusations against the Kronstadt 
rebels were "groundless". Deutscher totally fails to see the direct relation 
between the methods used by Lenin and Trotsky in 1921 and those other methods, 
perfected by Stalin and later used against the Old Bolsheviks themselves during 
the notorious Moscow trials of 1936 1937 and 1938.</p>

<p class="fst">In Victor Serge's <i><a href="../../../serge/1945/memoirs/ch04x.htm">Memoirs of a Revolutionary</a></i> there is a 
chapter devoted to Kronstadt.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> 
Serge's writings are particularly interesting in that he was in Leningrad in 
1921 and supported what the Bolsheviks were doing, albeit reluctantly. He did 
not however resort to the slanders and misrepresentations of other leading Party 
members. His comments throw light on the almost schizophrenic frame of mind of 
the rank and file of the Party at that time. For different reasons neither the 
Trotskyists nor the anarchists have forgiven Serge his attempts to reconcile 
what was best in their respective doctrines: the concern with reality and the 
concern with principle.</p>

<p class="fst">Easily available and worthwhile <i>anarchist</i> writings on the 
subject (in English) are virtually non-existent, despite the fact that many 
anarchists consider this area relevant to their ideas. Emma Goldman's <i>Living 
My Life</i> and Berkman's <i>The Bolshevik Myth</i> contain some vivid but 
highly subjective pages about the Kronstadt rebellion. <i><a href="../../../ciliga/1938/kronstadt.htm">The Kronstadt Revolt</a></i> 
by Anton Ciliga (produced as a pamphlet in 1942) is an excellent short account 
which squarely faces up to some of the fundamental issues. It has been 
unavailable for years. Voline's account, on the other hand, is too simplistic. 
Complex phenomena like the Kronstadt revolt cannot be meaningfully interpreted 
by loaded generalizations like "as Marxists, authoritarians and statists, the 
Bolsheviks could not permit any freedom or independent action of the masses". 
(Many have argued that there are strong Blanquist and even Bakuninist strands in 
Bolshevism, and that it is precisely these departures from Marxism that are at 
the root of Bolshevism's "elitist" ideology and practice.) Voline even 
reproaches the Kronstadt rebels with "speaking of power (the power of the 
Soviets) instead of getting rid of the word and of the idea altogether ..." The 
practical struggle however was not against "words" or even "ideas". It was a 
physical struggle against their concrete incarnation in history (in the form of 
bourgeois institutions). It is a symptom of anarchist muddle-headedness on this 
score that they can both reproach the Bolsheviks with dissolving the Constituent 
Assembly<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> ... and the Kronstadt 
rebels for proclaiming that they stood for soviet power! The "Soviet anarchists" 
clearly perceived what was at stake - even if many of their successors fail to. 
They fought to defend the deepest conquest of October - soviet power - against <i>
all</i> its usurpers, including the Bolsheviks.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<p class="sub">*</p>

<p class="fst">Our own contribution to the fiftieth anniversary celebrations 
will not consist in the usual panegyrics to the achievements of Russian 
rocketry. Nor will we chant paeans to Russian pig-iron statistics. Industrial 
expansion may be the prerequisite for a fuller, better life for all but is in no 
way synonymous with such a life, unless <i>all</i> social relations have been 
revolutionized. We are more concerned at the social costs of Russian 
achievements.</p>

<p class="fst">Some perceived what these costs would be at a very early stage. 
We are interested in bringing their prophetic warnings to a far wider audience. 
The final massacre at Kronstadt took place on March 18, 1921, exactly fifty 
years after the slaughter of the Communards by Thiers and Calliffet. The facts 
about the Commune are well known. But fifty years after the Russian Revolution 
we still have to seek basic information about Kronstadt. The facts are not easy 
to obtain. They lie buried under the mountains of calumny and distortion heaped 
on them by Stalinists and Trotskyists alike.</p>

<p class="fst">The publication of this pamphlet in English, at this particular 
time, is part of this endeavour. Ida Mett's book <i>La Commune de Cronstadt</i> 
was first published in 1938. It was republished in France ten years later but 
has been unobtainable for several years. In 1962 and 1963 certain parts of it 
were translated into English and appeared in <i>Solidarity</i> (II, 6 to 11). We 
now have pleasure in bringing to English-speaking readers a slightly abridged 
version of the book as a whole, which contains material hitherto unavailable in 
Britain.</p>

<p class="fst">Apart from various texts published in Kronstadt itself in March 
1921, Ida Mett's book contains Petrichenko's open letter of 1926, addressed to 
the British Communist Party. Petrichenko was the President of the Kronstadt 
Provisional Revolutionary Committee. His letter refers to discussions in the 
Political Bureau of the CPGB on the subject of Kronstadt, discussions which seem 
to have accepted that there was no extraneous intervention during the uprising. 
(Members of the CP and others might seek further enlightenment on the matter 
from King Street, whose archives on the matter should make interesting reading.)</p>

<p class="fst">Ida Mett writes from an anarchist viewpoint. Her writings however 
represent what is best in the revolutionary tradition of "class struggle" 
anarchism. She thinks in terms of a collective, proletarian solution to the 
problems of capitalism. The rejection of the class struggle, the 
anti-intellectualism, the preoccupation with transcendental morality and with 
personal salvation that characterize so many of the anarchists of today should 
not for a minute detract "Marxists" from paying serious attention to what she 
writes. We do not necessarily endorse all her judgments and have- in footnotes - 
corrected one or two minor factual inaccuracies in her text. Some of her 
generalizations seem to us too sweeping and some of her analyses of the 
bureaucratic phenomenon too simple to be of real use. But as a chronicle of what 
took place before, during and after Kronstadt, her account remains unsurpassed.</p>

<p class="fst">Her text throws interesting light on the attitude to the 
Kronstadt uprising shown at the time by various Russian political tendencies 
(anarchists, Mensheviks, Left and Right S.R.s, Bolsheviks, etc.). Some whose 
approach to politics is superficial in the extreme (and for whom a smear or a 
slogan is a substitute for real understanding) will point accusingly to some of 
this testimony, to some of these resolutions and manifestos as evidence 
irrevocably damning the Kronstadt rebels. "Look", they will say, "what the 
Mensheviks and Right SR:s were saying. Look at how they were calling for a return 
to the Constituent Assembly, and at the same time proclaiming their solidarity 
with Kronstadt. Isn't this proof positive that Kronstadt was a 
counter-revolutionary upheaval? You yourselves admit that rogues like Victor 
Chernov, President elect of the Constituent Assembly, offered to help the 
Kronstadters? What further evidence is needed?"</p>

<p class="fst">We are not afraid of presenting <i>all</i> the facts to our 
readers. Let them judge for themselves. It is our firm conviction that most 
Trotskyists and Leninists are - and are kept - as ignorant of this period of 
Russian history as Stalinists are of the period of the Moscow Trials. At best 
they vaguely sense the presence of skeletons in the cupboard. At worst they 
vaguely parrot what their leaders tell them, intellectually too lazy or 
politically too well-conditioned to probe for themselves. Real revolutions are 
never "pure". They unleash the deepest passions of men. People actively 
participate or are dragged into the vortex of such movements for a variety of 
often contradictory reasons. Consciousness and false consciousness are 
inextricably mixed. A river in full flood inevitably carries a certain amount of 
rubbish. A revolution in full flood carries a number of political corpses - and 
may even momentarily give them a semblance of life.</p>

<p class="fst">During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 many were the messages of 
verbal or moral support for the rebels, emanating from the West, piously 
preaching the virtues of bourgeois democracy or of free enterprise. The 
objective of those who spoke in these terms were anything but the institution of 
a classless society. But their support for the rebels remained purely verbal, 
particularly when it became clear to them what the real objectives of the 
revolution were: a fundamental democratization of Hungarian institutions <i>
without</i> a reversion to private ownership of the means of production.</p>

<p class="fst">The backbone of the Hungarian revolution was the network of 
workers' councils. Their main demands were for workers' management of production 
and for a government based on the councils. These facts justified the support of 
revolutionaries throughout the world. Despite the Mindszentys. Despite the 
Smallholders and Social-Democrats - or their shadows - now trying to jump on to 
the revolutionary bandwagon. The class critierion is the decisive one.</p>

<p class="fst">Similar considerations apply to the Kronstadt rebellion. Its core 
was the revolutionary sailors. Its main objectives were ones with which no real 
revolutionary could disagree. That others sought to take advantage of the 
situation is inevitable - and irrelevant. It is a question of who is calling the 
tune.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<p class="sub">*</p>

<p class="fst">Attitudes to the Kronstadt events, expressed nearly fifty years 
after the event often provide deep insight into the political thinking of 
contemporary revolutionaries. They may in fact provide a deeper insight into 
their conscious or unconscious aims than many a learned discussion about 
economics, or philosophy, or about other episodes of revolutionary history.</p>

<p class="fst">It is a question of one's basic attitude as to what socialism is 
all about. What are epitomized in the Kronstadt events are some of the most 
difficult problems of revolutionary strategy and revolutionary ethics: the 
problems of ends and means, of the relations between Party and masses, in fact 
of whether a Party is necessary at all.</p>

<p class="fst">Can the working class by itself only develop a trade union 
consciousness".<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> Should it even 
be allowed, at all times, to go that far?<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Or can the working class develop a deeper consciousness and 
understanding of its interests than can any organization allegedly acting on its 
behalf? When the Stalinists or Trotskyists speak of Kronstadt as "an essential 
action against the class enemy", when more "sophisticated" revolutionaries refer 
to it as a "tragic necessity", one is entitled to pause for a moment. One is 
entitled to ask how seriously they accept Marx's dictum that "the emancipation 
of the working class is the task of the working class itself. Do they take this 
seriously or do they pay mere lip-service to the words? Do they identify 
socialism with the autonomy (organizational and ideological) of the working 
class? Or do they see themselves, with their wisdom as to the "historical 
interests" of others, and with their judgments as to what should be "permitted", 
as the leadership around which the future elite will crystallize and develop? 
One is entitled not only to ask ... but also to suggest the answer!</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">"The creation of a socialist society means the organization 
of the workers on new foundations, their adaptation to those foundations and 
their labour re-education, with the one <i>unchanging</i> end of the increase in 
the productivity of labour ..." (p. 146).</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">"I consider that if the Civil War had not plundered our 
economic organs of all that was strongest, most independent, most endowed with 
initiative, we should undoubtedly have <i>entered the path of one-man management</i> 
in the sphere of economic administration much sooner and much less painfully" 
(pp. 162-163).</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">"We have been more than once accused of having substituted 
for the dictatorship of the Soviets the dictatorship of our own Party ... In the 
substitution of the power of the Party for the power of the working class there 
is nothing accidental, and in reality there is no substitution at all. The 
Communists express the fundamental interests of the working class ..." (p. 109).</p>

<p class="endnote">So much for the "anti-bureaucratic" antecedents of 
Trotskyism. It is interesting that the book was highly praised by Lenin. Lenin 
only took issue with Trotsky on the trade union question at the Central 
Committee meeting of November 8 and 9, 1920. Throughout most of 1920 Lenin had 
endorsed all Trotsky's bureaucratic decrees in relation to the unions.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> For an interesting account 
of the growth of the Factory Committees Movement - and of the opposition to them 
of the Bolsheviks at the First Ail-Russian Trade Union Convention (January 
1918), see Maximov's <i>The Guillotine at Work</i> (Chicago, 1940).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a> At the Ninth Party Congress 
(March 1920) Lenin introduced a resolution to the effect that the task of the 
unions was to explain the need for a "maximum curtailment of administrative 
collegia and the gradual introduction of individual management in units directly 
engaged in production" (Robert V. Daniels, <i>The Conscience of the Revolution</i> 
(Cambridge, Mass., 1960), p. 124).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n8" href="#fn8">[8]</a> Serge's writings on this 
matter were first brought to the attention of readers in the UK in 1961 (<i>Solidarity</i>, 
I, 7). This text was later reprinted as a pamphlet.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n9" href="#fn9">[9]</a> See Nicolas Walter's article 
in <i>
Freedom</i> (October 28, 1967) entitled "October 1917: No Revolution at All".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n10" href="#fn10">[10]</a> Lenin proclaimed so 
explicitly in his <i>What Is To Be Done?</i> (1902).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n11" href="#fn11">[11]</a> In a statement to the 
tenth Party Congress (1921) Lenin refers to a mere <i>discussion</i> on the 
trade unions as an "absolutely impermissible luxury" which "we" should not have 
permitted. These remarks speak unwitting volumes on the subject (and 
incidentally deal decisively with those who seek desperately for an "evolution" 
in their Lenin).</p>
