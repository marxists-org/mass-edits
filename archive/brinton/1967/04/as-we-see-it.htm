<hr>

<p class="fst">1. Throughout the world the vast majority of people have no 
control whatsoever over the decisions that most deeply and directly affect their 
lives. They sell their labour power while others who own or control the means of 
production accumulate wealth, make the laws and use the whole machinery of the 
State to perpetuate and reinforce their privileged positions.</p>

<p class="fst">2. During the past century the living standards of working people 
have improved. But neither these improved living standards, nor the 
nationalization of the means of production, nor the coming to power of parties 
claiming to represent the working class have basically altered the status of the 
worker. Nor have they given the bulk of mankind much freedom outside of 
production. East and West, capitalism remains an inhuman type of society where 
the vast majority are bossed at work and manipulated in consumption and leisure. 
Propaganda and policemen, prisons and schools, traditional values and 
traditional morality all serve to reinforce the power of the few and to convince 
or coerce the many into acceptance of a brutal, degrading and irrational system. 
The "Communist" world is not communist and the "Free" world is not free.</p>

<p class="fst">3. The trade unions and the traditional parties of the left 
started in business to change all this. But they have come to terms with the 
existing patterns of exploitation. In fact they are now essential if exploiting 
society is to continue working smoothly. The unions act as middlemen in the 
labour market. The political parties use the struggles and aspirations of the 
working class for their own ends. The degeneration of working class 
organizations, itself the result of the failure of the revolutionary movement, 
has been a major factor in creating working class apathy, which in turn has led 
to further degeneration of both parties and unions.</p>

<p class="fst">4. The trade unions and political parties cannot be reformed, 
"captured", or converted into instruments of working class emancipation. We 
don't call however for the proclamation of new unions, which in the conditions 
of today would suffer a similar fate to the old ones. Nor do we call for 
militants to tear up their union cards. Our aims are simply that the workers 
themselves should decide on the objectives of their struggles and that the 
control and organization of these struggles should remain firmly in their own 
hands. The <i>forms</i> which this self-activity of the working class may take 
will vary considerably from country to country and from industry to industry. 
Its basic <i>content</i> will not.</p>

<p class="fst">5. Socialism is not just the common ownership and control of the 
means of production and distribution. It means equality, real freedom, 
reciprocal recognition and a radical transformation in all human relations. It 
is man's understanding of his environment and of himself, his domination over 
his work and over such social institutions as he may need to create. These are 
not secondary aspects, which will automatically follow the expropriation of the 
ruling class. On the contrary they are essential parts of the whole process of 
social transformation, for without them no genuine social transformation will 
have taken place.</p>

<p class="fst">6. A socialist society can therefore only be built from below. 
Decisions concerning production and work will be taken by Workers' Councils 
composed of elected and revocable delegates. Decisions in other areas will be 
taken on the basis of the widest possible discussion and consultation among the 
people as a whole. This democratization of society down to its very roots is 
what we mean by "workers' power".</p>

<p class="fst">7. <i>Meaningful action</i>, for revolutionaries, is whatever 
increases the confidence the autonomy, the initiative, the participation, the 
solidarity, the equalitarian tendencies and the self-activity of the masses and 
whatever assists in their demystification. <i>Sterile and harmful action</i> is 
whatever reinforces the passivity of the masses, their apathy, their cynicism, 
their differentiation through hierarchy, their alienation, their reliance on 
others to do things for them and the degree to which they can therefore be 
manipulated by others - even by those allegedly acting on their behalf.</p>

<p class="fst">8. No ruling class in history has ever relinquished its power 
without a struggle and our present rulers are unlikely to be an exception. Power 
will only be taken from them through the conscious, autonomous action of the 
vast majority of the people themselves. The building of socialism will require 
mass understanding and mass participation. By their rigid hierarchical 
structure, by their ideas and by their activities, both social-democratic and 
Bolshevik types of organizations discourage this kind of understanding and 
prevent this kind of participation. The idea that socialism can somehow be 
achieved by an elite party (however "revolutionary") acting "on behalf of the 
working class is both absurd and reactionary.</p>

<p class="fst">9. We do not accept the view that by itself the working class can 
only achieve a trade union consciousness. On the contrary we believe that its 
conditions of life and its experiences in production constantly drive the 
working class to adopt priorities and values and to find methods of organization 
which challenge the established social order and established pattern of thought. 
These responses are implicitly socialist. On the other hand, the working class 
is fragmented, dispossessed of the means of communication, and its various 
sections are at different levels of awareness and consciousness. The task of the 
revolutionary organization is to help give proletarian consciousness an 
explicitly socialist content, to give practical assistance to workers in 
struggle, and to help those in different areas to exchange experiences and link 
up with one another.</p>

<p class="fst">10. We do not see ourselves as yet another leadership, but merely 
as an instrument of working class action. The function of <i>Solidarity</i> is 
to help all those who are in conflict with the present authoritarian social 
structure, both in industry and in society at large, to generalize their 
experience, to make a total critique of their condition and of its causes, and 
to develop the mass revolutionary consciousness necessary if society is to be 
totally transformed.</p>
