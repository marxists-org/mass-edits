<p class="fst">The standard of living of workers has improved considerably 
during the last century. The impoverishment predicted by Marx has not taken 
place. But capitalism remains an inhuman system where the vast majority are 
bossed at work and manipulated in consumption and leisure. Increased wages are 
balanced by speed-up and the creation of artificial needs. Both East and West, 
society is still dominated by ruling classes who control the means of 
production, use the state in their own interests and who are prepared to risk 
the destruction of humanity to defend these interests.</p>

<p class="fst">The decay of the trade unions and of the traditional parties has 
gone much further than is generally admitted. They cannot be reformed. They have 
come to terms with the existing system, of which they are now a key part. The 
degeneration of working class organizations, itself the result of the failure of 
the revolutionary movement, has been a major factor in creating working class 
apathy.</p>

<p class="fst">The same applies to the Communist Parties. They are equally 
impotent and although they seek to create a superficially different kind of 
society (namely state capitalism on the Russian or Chinese model) their aims can 
hardly be called socialist.</p>

<p class="fst">The road to socialism - and socialism itself - means the 
conscious and independent action of workers. It means the end of the division 
between leaders and led. By their rigid, hierarchical structure most 
"revolutionary" organizations encourage precisely those divisions. A socialist 
society will be one in which decisions will be taken by workers' councils, 
composed of elected and revocable delegates, and where the workers themselves 
will manage production.</p>

<p class="fst">The class struggle today takes mainly "unofficial" forms. 
Revolutionaries should be active in these struggles rather than attempting to 
take over the traditional organizations. Working class resistance to the 
employers and the union leaders is as strong as ever. But these struggles are 
mainly reflex actions: their aims are inevitably limited. If the working class 
is to learn and generalize its experiences and if it is to struggle for 
socialism it must form revolutionary organizations. These must be instruments of 
struggle, not a general staff imposed from the outside.</p>

<p class="fst">The idea that socialism can be achieved by an "elite" party, 
however "revolutionary" acting on behalf of the working class, is both absurd 
and reactionary. <i>Solidarity</i> does not present itself as yet another 
"leadership" but merely as a tool of struggle.</p>
