<p class="fst">Forget for a moment the scare campaigns of the recent elections: 
Scanlon and Jones presented by the yellow press as proselytizers of red 
revolution, Mr. Wilson in the garb of a latter-day Kerensky opening the gates to 
Bolshevism or worse, bank clerks freezing (<i>à la portugaise</i>) the funds of 
fleeting fascists, the great fear of the bourgeoisie about a "mafia of fanatical 
socialists" in control of the commanding heights ... of the National Executive 
of the Labour Party!</p>

<p class="fst">The reality is less lurid - and less encouraging. What we see 
around us is a confident and aggressive movement, increasingly aware of the fact 
that real power does not lie in Parliament, but profoundly divided as to 
objectives, strategy and tactics and completely at sea as to values and 
priorities. So divergent are its component strands that one has to ask, quite 
bluntly, whether one can legitimately speak of a movement. Among thinking 
socialists there is a deep malaise.</p>

<p class="fst">The purpose of this article is to explore the roots of this 
malaise, and to show that they lie in the transformations of class society 
itself. Over the last few decades - and in many different areas - established 
society has itself brought about the number of the things that the 
revolutionaries of yesterday were demanding. This has happened in relation to 
economic attitudes, in relation to certain forms of social organization, and in 
relation to various aspects of the personal and sexual revolutions. When this 
adaptation in fact <i>benefits</i> established society, it is legitimate to 
refer to it as "recuperation". This article seeks to start a discussion on the 
limits of recuperation.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Recuperation, of course, is nothing new. What is perhaps new is 
the extent to which most "revolutionaries" (whether they be demanding "more 
nationalization", more "self-management" or "more personal freedom") are unaware 
of the system's ability to absorb - and in the long run benefit from - these 
forms of "dissent". Class society has a tremendous resilience, a great capacity 
to cope with "subversion", to make icons of its iconoclasts, to draw sustenance 
from those who would throttle it. Revolutionaries must constantly be aware of 
this strength, otherwise they will fail to see what is happening around them. If 
certain sacred cows (or certain previous formulations, now found to be 
inadequate) have to be sacrificed, we'd rather do the job ourselves.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h1">Recuperation of economic demands</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Keynesian economic policies, once considered radical threats to 
bourgeois society, are today widely accepted as essential to the functioning of 
modern capitalism. The demands for nationalization of the mines or railways, 
for national health insurance, for unemployment benefit and for state pensions 
have been totally recuperated. Despite occasional nostalgic (and largely 
irrelevant) glances into the past, no Conservative politician, seeking to retain 
a shred of credibility, would today advocate the return of the mines or of the 
railways to private ownership - or the dismantling of the essential structure of 
the "welfare" state. All socialists would agree, thus far.</p>

<p class="fst">But there is then a parting of the ways. We would claim that the 
centralization of all the means of production in the hands of the state - the 
most "radical" demand of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> - has been achieved in 
many parts of the world without any corresponding enhancement in the areas of 
human freedom. In fact an exploiting society, divided into order-givers and 
order-takers, functions far better on this type of economic base, which 
eliminates many of the irrationalities of laissez-faire capitalism. Whatever the 
human aspirations of their rank and file, the ideologies and programmes of Social 
Democratic, Communist, Trotskyist or Maoist groups in the West provide the most 
articulate demands for this kind of social organization. These groups are the 
midwives of State Capitalism. They may differ as to tempo and as to tactics. 
They may argue about what they consider to be (for others) the acceptable or 
unacceptable costs. But their fundamental objective is the same - and is 
moreover in keeping with the deepest requirements of Capital itself. <i>Pace</i> 
the ghosts of Hayek and of Schumpeter, <i>pace</i> Enoch Powell and Keith 
Joseph, the division of society into rulers and ruled will not be abolished by 
the abolition of the "free market" or, for that matter, by anything that Messrs. 
Wilson or Gollan (or the "theoreticians" of any of the Marxist sects) may have 
in mind.</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover all over the Third World (from Sékou Touré's Guinea to 
North Vietnam, from Iraq to Zanzibar) "Marxist-Leninist" ideas are today 
influencing the birth and moulding the economic life of many developing 
countries. All are ruthlessly exploitative societies, geared to the rapid 
development of the productive forces. Today this is only possible on the basis 
of intense primary accumulation, carried out on the backs of the peasantry. Here 
again erstwhile revolutionary ideas are becoming vehicles for new forms of 
enslavement.</p>

<p class="fst">To paraphrase Marx, it is not what men think they are doing that 
matters. What matters is the objective result of their beliefs and actions. 
Class society can well recuperate the economic demands of the traditional left. 
It is not of fundamental importance, in this respect, whether various ruling 
classes are fully aware of what is happening to them. They clearly differ from 
one another in the degree of insight they have achieved into their own 
long-term, historical interests. The more far-sighted among them now accept the 
centralization of the means of production in the hands of the State as the 
essential precondition for the growth of the productive forces. For most Marxist 
socialists (and for the bourgeoisie) this growth is <i>the</i> fundamental issue. This 
is what unites them. This is where the bourgeois vision and the Marxist vision 
coalesce. For both of them economic growth is what politics (and ultimately what 
life itself) is all about. There are few other dimensions to their thinking. For 
both of them the future is mainly about "more of the same". And the rest? The 
rest is for "after the revolution". At best, it will look after itself. At 
worst, if one speaks to a traditional Marxist about such issues as women's 
liberation, ecology, the "counter-culture", etc. one is denounced as a 
"diversionist" in tones showing how deeply the work ethic, patriarchal attitudes 
and value system of the existing society have permeated their thinking.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h2">Recuperation of institutional forms</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Sections of the left have fortunately gone far beyond the demands 
for nationalization, planning, etc. In the wake of the Russian Revolution small 
groups of "left" communists clearly foresaw the course of events which this type 
of "socialism" would lead to. Slandered by Lenin, denounced by the "orthodox" 
communists, they warned of what lay ahead: the rule of the party would soon 
result in the emergence of a new ruling class, based not on the private 
ownership of the means of production but on a monopoly of decisional authority 
in all areas of economic, political and social life. To the hegemony of the 
Party and to the omniscience of its Central Committee the left communist 
counter-poised the knowledge and power of an enlightened and autonomous working 
class. They posited the institutional form this power would take: the Workers' 
Councils. This was no genial blueprint for a new society sucked out of the thumb 
of a Gorter or a Pannekoek. From the Paris Commune to the Russian Revolution of 
1917 the "council" form of organization had been the living historical product 
of the class struggle itself. The warnings of these earlier revolutionaries have 
been fully justified.</p>

<p class="fst">But their vision remains limited. Despite Pannekoek's interests 
in science and philosophy, Rühle's interest in pedagogy, and Korsch's stress on 
the need for a deep-going cultural critique, most of the writings of the left 
communists centred on problems of work and of production and distribution. They 
lived in a very different era from our own, and had little of significance to 
say about what have become very important areas of social life: 
bureaucratization, alienation in consumption and leisure, authoritarian 
conditioning, the "youth revolt", women's liberation, etc. Even some of their 
institutional proposals have been partly overtaken by events.</p>

<p class="fst">The recuperation of the demand for working class power at the 
point of production and for a society based on Workers' Councils has, for 
instance, taken on a particularly sinister form. Confronted with the 
bureaucratic monstrosity of Stalinist and post-Stalinist Russia, yet wishing to 
retain some credibility among their working class supporters, various strands of 
Bolshevism have sought posthumously to rehabilitate the concept of "workers' 
control". Although "workers' control" was only referred to once in the documents 
of the first four congresses of the Communist International it has recently 
become one of the Top Ten Slogans. Between 1917 and 1921 all attempts by the 
working class to assert real power over production - or to transcend the narrow 
role allocated to it by the Party - were smashed by the Bolsheviks, after first 
having been denounced as anarchist or anarcho-syndicalist deviations. Today 
workers' control is presented as a sort of sugar coating to the pill of 
nationalization of every Trotskyist or Leninist micro-bureaucrat on the make. 
Those who strangled the viable infant are now hawking the corpse around. The 
Institute for Workers' Control even runs annual conferences, addressed and 
dominated by trade union officials appointed for life. Those who are not 
prepared to allow workers to control their own organizations here and now 
serenade sundry simpletons with fanciful tunes as to their fate in the future. 
Recuperation here is taking place amid incredible confusion.</p>

<p class="fst">For a long time the advocacy of genuine workers' control (or, as 
we prefer to call it, workers' self management)<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> remained confined to small 
groups of revolutionaries swimming against the great bureaucratic tide. 
Following the French events of May 1968 the demand took on a new reality and a 
new coherence. People began to see self-management as the dominant theme (and 
Workers' Councils as the institutional form) of a new society in which 
bureaucracy would be eliminated, and in which ordinary people would at last 
achieve genuine power over many aspects of their everyday life. But this again 
was to ignore the system's capacity for integrating dissent and harnessing it to 
its own advantage.</p>

<p class="fst">Can the demand for self-management be geared to the requirements 
of class society itself? An honest answer would be "yes, in some respects". Yes, 
providing those operating the self-management still accepted the values of the 
system. Yes, if it remained strictly localized. Yes, provided it was eviscerated 
of all political content Car assembly plants seeking to obtain the participation 
of the workers have been operating for some time in the Volvo and Saab factories 
in Sweden. Under the "with it" guise of enriching the workers' job, employers 
have continued to enrich themselves. Groups of workers are allowed to manage 
their own alienation. The powers-that-be seek to resuscitate the anaemic 
institutions of existing society (increasingly abandoned by those expected to 
make them function) with transfusions of "participation". No wonder the slogan 
has been taken up by everyone from Gaullist deputies to our own Liberals.</p>

<p class="fst">Revolutionaries are in some measures to blame for this confusion 
of form and content. They have insufficiently warned against the dangers 
inherent in any attempts at self-management with capitalism. And, in relation to 
the future, they have insufficiently stressed the limitations of the demand. 
Self-management and Workers' Councils are means to liberation. They are not 
liberation itself. Many revolutionaries have, moreover, tended to underestimate 
the complex problems of society as a whole. These have to be considered in 
addition to the problems of particular groups of workers. Our vision has never 
been "the railways to the railwaymen, the dust to the dustmen". We are not for 
self-managed insurance empires, for self-managed advertising companies, for the 
self-managed production of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p class="fst">This is not to say that self-management will not be the dominant 
theme, and the council probably the institutional form of any kind of socialist 
society. But they are no more than that. Into those particular bottles many 
wines can be poured. In contemporary society self-management could very well 
develop on a reformist, racist, nationalistic or militaristic basis. The 
historical precedents are here. Many Workers' Councils in Germany - in December 
1918, and again later on - voted to surrender power to parliamentary 
institutions. Between 1930 and 1945 the vast majority of the British and German 
people identified with their respective rulers and mobilized themselves (or 
allowed themselves to be mobilized) in the defence of interests that were not 
their own. Israeli self-managed kibbutzim are vehicles for the dissemination of 
Zionist ideology and for implementing (anti-Arab) discrimination, i.e. 
anti-socialist policies. In Northern Ireland, amid an "unparalleled explosion of 
self-management", the self-activity of a civilian population recently brought 
down a government ... in the name of sectarian and mystified objectives. The 
lessons are clear. <i>Self-management</i>, <i>divorced from socialist politics</i>, <i>
is meaningless</i>.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h3">Recuperation of "proto-Marxist" demands</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Confronted with the fact that established society has 
successfully co-opted both the economic objectives and some of the institutional 
prescriptions of those who wanted to challenge it, radicals have responded in a 
numbers of ways.</p>

<p class="fst">One response has been to delve deeper into Marx. The 'communist 
project' is redefined in proto-Marxist terms. We now have Marx <i>à la carte</i>. 
What is stressed is not what was the historical reality of Marxism (even in 
Marx's day) but a vision which, although valid, seldom went beyond the realm of 
rhetoric. The Marx of "the proletarians have no Fatherland" replaces the Marx of 
the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71 who supported first Bismarck's armies, then - 
after Sedan - the forces of the Second Empire. The Marx who denounced the slogan 
"a fair day's wage for a fair day's work" (arguing instead for "the abolition of 
the wages system") replaces the more prosaic Marx, manoeuvring among the 
Lucrafts and the Maltman Barrys in the counsels of the First International. The 
Marx who thundered that "the emancipation of the working class is the task of 
the working class itself" erases the pathetic figure of the Marx of 1872, 
cooking the last congress of the International (the only one he attended in 
person), inventing non-existing delegations, shifting the venues of future 
meetings to harass the supporters of the equally authoritarian Bakunin.</p>

<p class="fst">But are even these proto-Marxist prescriptions adequate? Is the 
"abolition of frontiers" any kind of guarantee as to the type of regime that 
will hold sway over the new, frontierless expanse? Is the vision of an 
exploitative society, fusing the techniques of domination of both East and West, 
just a nightmare dreamed up by the writers of science fiction? Is the abolition 
of the wage labour any guarantee against exploitation and alienation? Were there 
not exploitative societies long before wage labour appeared on the historical 
scene? Wage labour underpins and reinforces hierarchies of power. Its abolition 
does not necessarily abolish such hierarchies. Class society might even 
recuperate demands of this kind.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h4">Recuperation of the "personal revolution"</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Another response of those confronted with the tremendous 
recuperative powers of established society has been a tendency to seek 
individual emancipation, to create in the "here and now" microcosms of the 
alternative society. Some advocates of this viewpoint see the growth of social 
freedom as the by-product of the addition of one "free" individual to another, rather like workers going to 
Ruskin College to become "emancipated one by one". This type of revolt, as long 
as it is conceived in purely individual terms, can readily be recuperated by 
established society. Individual revolt, whether in clothing or in hair styles, 
whether in food preferences or in musical tastes, whether in sexual mores or in 
philosophical attitudes, readily becomes a commodity to be frenetically 
exploited in the interests of Capital itself. (The important book, <i>The Failure 
of the Sexual Revolution</i> by George Frankl, deals with this theme.)</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h5">The limits of recuperation</a></h2>

<p class="fst">In <i>The Irrational in Politics</i> we wrote that exploiting 
society would not be able to tolerate "the mass development of critical, 
demystified, self-reliant, sexually emancipated, autonomous, non-alienated 
persons, conscious of what they want <i>and prepared to struggle for it</i>". We 
still hold this idea to be basically correct. Its core - that one cannot 
conceive of any genuinely liberatory movement without genuinely liberated 
individuals - seems irrefutable. But our formulation was inadequate. We should 
have spoken of individuals prepared <i>collectively</i> to struggle for what 
they wanted. And we should have spoken more about the <i>objectives</i> of the 
struggle. We should have described more clearly what the vision was, in our eyes 
at least. The <i>socialist</i> transformation of society is not an automatic 
process, or a reflex activity. It requires a sense of direction. There may be 
many roads to the promised land but it can surely only help if people know where 
they are going.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us take it for granted that meaningful activity needs to be 
collective, that social transformation needs emancipated individuals, and that 
the institutional framework of any new society will probably be based, in part 
at least, on those forms which the struggle itself has repeatedly thrown up at 
its moments of deepest insight and creativity. What we now need to think about - 
and to discuss widely throughout the libertarian left - is the <i>political 
content</i> of an activity that <i>consciously</i> seeks both to avoid 
recuperation and to be relevant to the conditions of today.</p>

<p class="fst">Are certain yardsticks necessary to define such an activity? I 
personally think the answer is "yes" - with the proviso that the definition must 
be seen as an ongoing process. Should revolutionaries who share common 
objectives group together, first to discuss their objectives and then to fight 
for them? Again I think the answer is "yes". "Political inexistentialism" is 
only relevant if one thinks there is some divine guidance ensuring that every 
struggle helps move society in a socialist direction.</p>

<p class="fst">It is only if libertarians speak openly about these questions 
that they will be able to present a credible alternative to the authoritarian 
left. If socialism is the creation of forms of living that will enable all - 
free from external constraints or internalized inhibitions - to rise to their 
full stature, to fulfil themselves as human beings, to enjoy themselves, to 
relate to one another without treading on anybody (and this is as good a 
definition of socialism as any other) - we should say so loud and clear. And we 
should not be afraid of criticizing any activities - however "self-managed" - 
that lead in an opposite direction. Socialism, after all, is about a specific 
way of socializing. In this discussion we must not forget the economic 
prerequisites of what we seek. Nor must we confuse them with the objective 
itself. Finally we must not underestimate the forces we are up against, 
including the recuperative powers of established society. An ongoing 
reassessment of the degree to which one's former goals have been recuperated is 
the most effective antidote to the malaise on the left, and the only possible 
prescription for remaining a revolutionary.</p>
