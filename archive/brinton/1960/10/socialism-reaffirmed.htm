<p class="fst">We here outline certain ideas which might form a basis for a 
regroupment of revolutionary socialists.</p>

<p class="fst">None of the traditional working class organizations express the 
interests of the class. Their degeneration and bureaucratization have been 
accompanied by a profound decay of socialist theory, of concepts of struggle and 
organization and even of fundamental notions concerning the nature of socialism. 
Agreement must be reached on what socialism is, if revolutionary practice is 
genuinely to assist the working class and is not to result in further confusion 
and demoralization. The following points are, in our opinion, quite basic:</p>

<p class="fst">(1) "The proletarian movement is the <i>self-conscious</i>, <i>
independent</i> movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense 
majority". Some of the "revolutionary" tendencies pay lip-service to this idea. 
None take it seriously, or even seem to understand its implications. 
"Self-conscious" implies that the class itself must understand the full 
significance of its actions. 'Independent' implies that the class itself must 
decide the objectives and methods of its struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">(2) "The emancipation of the working class is the task of the 
workers themselves". The working class cannot entrust its historical task to 
anyone else. No "saviours from on high" will free it. The class will never 
achieve power, <i>its</i> power, if it entrusts the revolutionary struggle to 
others. Mass socialist consciousness and mass participation are essential. The 
revolutionary organization must assist in their development and must ruthlessly 
expose all illusions that the problem can be solved in any other way.</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover the working class will never <i>hold</i> power unless it 
is prepared consciously and permanently to mobilize <i>itself</i> to this end. 
All previous attempts by the working class to delegate power to specific groups, 
in the hope that such groups would exert power "on its behalf" have resulted in 
the formation of bureaucracies and in the economic and political expropriation 
of the working class. Socialism, unlike all previous forms of social 
organization, requires the constant, conscious and permanent participation of 
the great majority.</p>

<p class="fst">(3) The fundamental aspect of all class society is that a 
specific social group assumes a dominant position in the relations of 
production. In this position it firstly "disposes of the conditions of 
production" (i.e. organizes and manages production) and secondly determines the 
distribution of the total social product. Individual ownership of the means of 
production is but one of several possible ways in which a ruling class can 
legitimize its domination.</p>

<p class="fst">Every ruling class strives to perpetuate its privileged status in 
society through its control of the instruments of coercion, i.e. the State 
machine. No ruling class in history has ever surrendered its dominant position 
in the economy and its control of the State without ferocious struggle.</p>

<p class="fst"> (4) The fundamental contradiction of contemporary society is its 
division into those who own, manage, decide and direct, and the majority who, 
because they are deprived of access to the means of production, have to toil and 
are forced to comply with decisions they have not themselves taken. This 
contradiction is the basis of alienation, of the class struggle and of the deep 
going crises which affect both bourgeois and bureaucratic societies.</p>

<p class="fst">The objective of the class struggle is to ensure, through the 
revolutionary accession to power of the working class, the abolition of all 
antagonistic divisions within society and of all the limitations these divisions 
impose upon men's lives.</p>

<p class="fst">(5) By its everyday struggle in capitalist society, the working 
class develops a consciousness which has an essentially socialist content. The 
class struggle is not only a struggle for surplus value (as "vulgar" Marxists 
would have us believe). It is also a struggle for completely different 
conditions of existence. This struggle takes place at the point of production, 
where it challenges both bourgeois and bureaucratic prerogatives of management.</p>

<p class="fst">It is in the factory and the workshop that the workers 
counterpoise their wishes and aspirations to the bureaucratic decisions of the 
bosses, and attempt to assert their own forms of organization against those 
imposed upon them from above. This aspect of the class struggle has the most 
profoundly revolutionary implications, for who manages production manages, in 
the last analysis, society itself. The revolutionary organization must stress, 
in its agitation and propaganda, this particular aspect of the working class 
struggle and underline its fundamentally socialist content.</p>

<p class="fst">(6) The working class has repeatedly attempted to solve the basic 
question of its status as an exploited class. It is untrue that workers are only 
capable of achieving "trade union consciousness". The Paris Commune of 1871, the 
revolutions of 1905 and 1917, the Spanish Revolution of 1936-38 and the 
Hungarian Workers' Councils of 1956, all prove that the working class is 
capable of rising to the greatest heights of revolutionary consciousness, and of 
challenging the very basis of all exploiting regimes.</p>

<p class="fst">(7) Between its great revolutionary upsurges, the working class 
has attempted to create political and trade union organizations to fight for 
both its immediate and long-term interests. These organizations have all 
degenerated and now express non-proletarian social interests. This degeneration 
has an objective basis, in the changing structure of capitalist society, and a 
subjective basis in the imposition of capitalist methods of thinking and 
organization into the ranks of the labour movement. Both facts therefore reflect 
the persistence of capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">The struggle of the working class for its social emancipation is 
not just a simple, day-by-day struggle against capitalist exploitation. It also 
takes place within the working class itself, against the constant rebirth of 
capitalist ideas and reformist illusions. The fight of the revolutionary 
organization against all forms of ideological mystification - and against those 
who disseminate them - is both essential and inevitable.</p>

<p class="fst">(8) Socialism means workers' management, both at the level of the 
factory and of society as a whole. If the working class does not hold economic 
power firmly in its own hands, its political power will at best be insecure. As 
long as the working class holds economic power, its political power cannot 
degenerate. Factory committees and workers' councils are the probable forms 
through which the working class will exert its rule.</p>

<p class="fst">"Nationalization" and "planning" can only have a socialist 
content if associated with workers' management of production and working class 
political power. In and of themselves, they can solve nothing. If the workers do 
not themselves manage society, "nationalization" and "planning" can become 
ruthless instruments of exploitation.</p>

<p class="fst">(9) The class needs a revolutionary organization, not as its 
self-appointed leadership but as an instrument of its struggle. The organization 
should assist workers in dispute, help through its press to generalize working 
class experience, provide a framework for linking up autonomous organs of 
working class struggle and constantly stress the ideas and revolutionary 
potentialities of <i>independent mass action</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The structure of the organization should reflect the highest 
achievements of working class struggle (i.e. workers' councils) rather than 
imitate capitalist types of organization. It should anticipate the socialist 
future of society rather than mirror its capitalist past. In practice this 
means:</p>

<p class="indentb">that <i>local organs have the fullest autonomy</i>, in relation 
to their own activities, that is in keeping with the general purpose and outlook 
of the organization;</p>

<p class="indentb">that <i>direct democracy</i> (i.e. the collective decision of 
all those concerned) is resorted to wherever materially possible;</p>

<p class="indentb">that all central bodies having power of decision involving 
others should be constituted by <i>delegates</i>, these being <i>elected</i> by 
those they represent and <i>revocable</i> by them, <i>at any time</i>.</p>
