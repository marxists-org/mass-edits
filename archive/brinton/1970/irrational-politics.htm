<p class="information">"Propaganda and policemen, prisons and schools, traditional 
values and traditional morality all serve to reinforce the power of the few and 
to convince or coerce the many into acceptance of a brutal, degrading and 
irrational system." (AS WE SEE IT - Solidarity)</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="h1">Introduction</a></h2>

<p class="fst">This pamphlet is an attempt to analyze the various mechanisms 
whereby modern society manipulates its wage (and house) slaves into accepting 
their slavery and - at least in the short term - seems to succeed. It does not 
deal with "police" and "jails" as ordinarily conceived but with those 
internalized patterns of repression and coercion, and with those intellectual 
prisons in which the "mass individual" is today entrapped.</p>

<p class="fst">The pamphlet starts by giving a few examples of the irrational 
behaviour - at the level of politics - of classes, groups and individuals. It 
proceeds to reject certain facile "interpretations" put forward to explain these 
phenomena. It probes the various ways in which the soil (the individual psyche 
of modern man) has been rendered fertile (receptive) for an authoritarian, 
hierarchical and class-dominated culture. It looks at the family as the locus of 
reproduction of the dominant ideology, and at sexual repression as an important 
determinant of social conditioning, resulting in the mass production of 
individuals perpetually craving authority and leadership and forever afraid of 
walking on their own or of thinking for themselves. Some of the problems of the 
developing sexual revolution are then discussed. The pamphlet concludes by 
exploring a new dimension in the failure of the Russian Revolution. Throughout 
the aim is to help people acquire additional insight into their own psychic 
structure. The fundamental desires and aspirations of the ordinary individual, 
so long distorted and repressed, are in deep harmony with an objective such as 
the libertarian reconstruction of society. The revolutionary "ideal" must 
therefore be made less remote and abstract. It must be shown to be the 
fulfilment - starting here and now - of peoples' own independent lives.</p>

<p class="fst">The pamphlet consists of two main essays: 'The Irrational in 
Politics' and 'The Russian Experience'. These can be read independently. The 
subject matter does not overlap although the main arguments interlock at several 
levels. The essays are followed by an appendix: an excerpt from Clara Zetkin's 
<i>Reminiscences of Lenin</i>, which illustrates an aspect of Lenin's thinking 
little known - or desirably forgotten - by all those Leninists now jumping on 
the bandwagon of women's liberation.</p>

<p class="fst">Frequent references will be found to the works of Wilhelm Reich. 
This should not be taken to imply that we subscribe to all that Reich wrote - a 
point spelt out in fuller and more specific detail later on. In the area that 
concerns us Reich's most relevant works were written in the early 1930s. At that 
time, although critical of developments in Russia (and more critical still of 
the policy of the German Communist Party) Reich still subscribed to many of 
their common fundamental assumptions. Even later he still spoke of the "basic 
socialism of the Soviet Union"<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
and muted his criticisms of the Bolshevik leaders to an extent that is no longer 
possible for us, writing four decades later. Moreover such is the influence of 
authoritarian conditioning that even those who have achieved the deepest insight 
into its mechanisms cannot fully escape its effects. There is an undoubted 
authoritarian strand in Reich.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A final point concerns the section on the historical roots of 
sexual repression. The author (who is neither a historian nor an anthropologist) 
found this difficult to write. There seems little doubt, on the evidence 
available, that sexual repression arose at a specific point in time and 
fulfilled a specific social function - although experts differ as to many of the 
details. The difficulty here has been to steer a middle course between the great 
system builders of the nineteenth century - who tended to "tidy up reality" in 
order to make it conform to their grandiose generalizations - and the 
theoretical nihilism of many contemporary social scientists who refuse to see 
the forest for the trees. For instance the reluctance of Establishment 
anthropologists to envisage their subject from a cultural-evolutionary viewpoint 
often stems, one suspects, from fear of the revolutionary implications of such 
an approach and of its implicit threat to contemporary institutions. We share 
none of these fears and can therefore look into this area without anxiety.</p>

<h1>The Irrational in Politics</h1>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">1. Some Examples</a></h3>

<p class="fst">For anyone interested in politics the "irrational" behaviour of 
individuals, groups or large sections of the population looms as an unpleasant, 
frightening, but incontrovertible fact. Here are a few examples.</p>

<p class="fst">Between 1914 and 1918 millions of working people slaughtered one 
another in the "war to end wars". They died for ends which were not theirs, 
defending the interests of their respective rulers. Those who had nothing 
rallied to their respective flags and butchered one another in the name of 
"Kaiser" or "King and Country". Twenty years later the process was repeated, on 
an even vaster scale.</p>

<p class="fst">In the early 1930s the economic crisis hit Germany. Hundreds of 
thousands were out of work and many were hungry. Bourgeois society revealed its 
utter incapacity even to provide the elementary material needs of men. The time 
was ripe for radical change. Yet at this critical juncture millions of men and 
women (including very substantial sections of the German working class) 
preferred to follow the crudely nationalistic, self-contradictory 
(anti-capitalist and anti-communist) exhortations of a reactionary demagogue, 
preaching a mixture of racial hatred, puritanism and ethnological nonsense, 
rather than embark on the unknown road of social revolution.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In New Delhi in 1966 hundreds of thousands of half-starving 
Indian peasants and urban poor actively participated in the biggest and most 
militant demonstration the town had ever known. Whole sections of the city were 
occupied, policemen attacked, cars and buses burnt. The object of this massive 
action was not, however, to protest against the social system which maintained 
the vast mass of the people in a state of permanent poverty and made a mockery 
of their lives. It was to denounce some contemplated legislation permitting cow 
slaughter under specific circumstances. Indian "revolutionaries" meanwhile were 
in no position to make meaningful comment. Did they not still allow their 
parents to fix their marriages for them and considerations of caste repeatedly 
to colour their politics?</p>

<p class="fst">In Britain several million working people, disappointed with the 
record of the present Labour Government, with its wage freeze and attempted 
assault on the unions, will vote Conservative within the next few weeks. As they 
did in 1930. And in 1950-51. Or, to the unheard tune of encouragement from 
self-styled revolutionaries, they will vote Labour, expecting (or not) that 
things will be "different next time".</p>

<p class="fst">At a more mundane level the behaviour of consumers today is no 
more "rational" than that of voters or of the oppressed classes in history. 
Those who understand the roots of popular preference know how easily demand can 
be manipulated. Advertizing experts are fully aware that rational choice has 
little to do with consumer preferences. When a housewife is asked why she 
prefers one product to another the reasons she gives are seldom the real ones 
(even if she is answering in total good faith).</p>

<p class="fst">Largely unconscious motives even influence the ideas of 
revolutionaries and the type of organization in which they choose to be active. 
At first sight it might appear paradoxical that those aspiring to a 
non-alienated and creative society based on equality and freedom should "break" 
with bourgeois conceptions ... only to espouse the hierarchical, dogmatic, 
manipulatory and puritanical ideas of Leninism. It might appear odd that their 
"rejection" of the irrational and arbitrarily imposed behaviour patterns of 
bourgeois society, with its demands for uncritical obedience and acceptance of 
authority, should take the form of that epitome of alienated activity: following 
the tortuous "line" of a vanguard Party. It might seem strange that those who 
urge people to think for themselves and to resist the brainwashing of the mass 
media should be filled with anxiety whenever new ideas raise their troublesome 
heads within their own ranks.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> Or 
that revolutionaries today should still seek to settle personal scores through 
resort to the methods prevailing in the bourgeois jungle outside. But, as we 
shall show, there is an internal coherence in all this apparent irrationality.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">2. Some Inadequate Explanations</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Confronted with disturbing facts like mass popular support for 
imperialist wars or the rise of fascism a certain type of traditional 
revolutionary can be guaranteed to provide a stereotyped answer. He will 
automatically stress the "betrayal" or "inadequacy" of the Second or Third 
Internationals, or of the German Communist Party ... or of this or that 
leadership which, for some reason or another, failed to rise to the historical 
occasion. (People who argue this way don't even seem to appreciate that the 
repeated <i>tolerance</i> by the masses of such "betrayals" or "inadequacies" 
itself warrants a serious explanation.)</p>

<p class="fst">Most sophisticated revolutionaries will lay the blame elsewhere. 
The means of moulding public opinion (press, radio, TV, churches, schools and 
universities) are in the hands of the ruling class. These media consequently 
disseminate ruling-class ideas, values and priorities - day in, day out. What is 
disseminated affects all layers of the population, contaminating everyone. Is it 
surprising, these revolutionaries will ask with a withering smile, that under 
such circumstances the mass of people still retain reactionary ideas?<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This explanation, although partially correct, is insufficient. In 
the long run it will not explain the continued acceptance by the working class 
of bourgeois rule - or that such rule has only been overthrown to be replaced by 
institutions of state capitalist type, embodying fundamentally similar 
hierarchical relationships (cult of leader, total delegation of authority to an 
"elite" Party, worship of revealed truth to be found in sacred texts or in the 
edicts of the Central Committee). If - both East and West - millions of people 
cannot face up to [the] implications of their exploitation, if they cannot perceive 
their enforced intellectual and personal underdevelopment, if they are unaware 
of the intrinsically repressive character of so much that they consider 
"rational", "commonsense", "obvious", or "natural" (hierarchy, inequality and 
the puritan ethos, for instance), if they are afraid of initiative and of 
self-activity, afraid of thinking new thoughts and of treading new paths, and if 
they are ever ready to follow this leader or that (promising them the moon), or 
this Party or that (undertaking to change the world "on their behalf"), it is 
because there are powerful factors conditioning their behaviour <i>from a very 
early age</i> and inhibiting their accession to a different kind of 
consciousness.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us consider for a moment - and not through rose-tinted 
spectacles - the average middle-aged working-class voter today (it matters 
little in this respect whether he votes "Conservative" or "Labour"). He is 
probably hierarchy-conscious, xenophobic, racially-prejudiced, pro-monarchy, 
pro-capital-punishment, pro-law-and-order, anti-demonstrator, anti-longhaired 
students and anti-dropout. He is almost certainly sexually repressed (and hence 
an avid, if vicarious, consumer of the distorted sexuality endlessly depicted in 
the pages of the <i>News of the World</i>). No "practical" Party (aiming at 
power through the ballot-box) would ever dream of appealing to him through the 
advocacy of wage equality, workers' management of production, racial 
integration, penal reform, abolition of the monarchy, dissolution of the police, 
sexual freedom for adolescents or the legalization of pot. Anyone proclaiming 
this kind of "transitional programme" would not only fail to get support but 
would probably be considered some kind of a nut.</p>

<p class="fst">But there is an even more important fact. Anyone trying to 
discuss matters of this kind will almost certainly meet not only with disbelief 
but also that positive hostility that often denotes latent anxiety.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> 
One doesn't meet this kind of response if one argues various meaningless or 
downright ludicrous propositions. Certain subjects are clearly emotionally 
loaded. Discussing them generates peculiar resistances that are hardly amenable 
to rational argument.</p>

<p class="fst">It is the purpose of this pamphlet to explore the nature and 
cause of these resistances and to point out that they are not innate but 
socially determined. (If they were innate, there would be no rational or 
socialist perspective whatsoever.) We will be led to conclude that these 
resistances are the result of a long-standing conditioning, going back to 
earliest childhood, and that this conditioning is mediated through the whole 
institution of the patriarchal family. The net result is a powerful 
reinforcement and perpetuation of the dominant ideology and the mass production 
of individuals with slavery built into them, individuals ready at a later stage 
to accept the authority of schoolteacher, priest, employer and politician (and 
to endorse the prevailing pattern of "rationality"). Understanding this 
collective character structure gives one new insight into the frequently 
"irrational" behaviour of individuals or social groups and into the "irrational 
in politics". It might also provide mankind with new means of transcending these 
obstacles.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">3. The Ignored Area and the Traditional Left</a></h3>

<p class="fst">This whole area has been largely ignored by Marxist 
revolutionaries. The appropriate tool for understanding this aspect of human 
behaviour - namely psychoanalysis - was only developed in the first two decades 
of this century. Freud's major contribution to knowledge (the investigation of 
causality in psychological life, the description of infantile and juvenile 
sexuality, the honest statement of fact that there was more to sex than 
procreation, the recognition of the influence of unconscious instinctual drives 
- and of their repression - in determining behaviour patterns, the description 
of how such drives are repressed in accordance with the prevailing social 
dictates, the analysis of the consequences of this repression in terms of 
symptoms, and in general "the consideration of the unofficial and unacknowledged 
sides of human life")<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> only became 
part of our social heritage several decades after Marx's death. Certain 
reactionary aspects of classical psychoanalysis (the "necessary" adaptation of 
the instinctual life to the requirements of a society whose class nature was 
never explicitly proclaimed, the "necessary" sublimation of "undisciplined" 
sexuality in order to maintain "social stability", "civilization" and the 
cultural life of society,<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> the 
theory of the death instinct, etc.) were only to be transcended later still by 
the revolutionary psychoanalysis of Wilhelm Reich<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> 
and others.</p>

<p class="fst">Reich set out to elaborate a social psychology based on both 
Marxism and psychoanalysis. His aim was to explain how ideas arose in men's 
minds, in relation to the real condition of their lives, and how in turn such 
ideas influenced human behaviour. There was clearly a discrepancy between the 
material conditions of the masses and their conservative outlook. No appeal to 
psychology was necessary to understand why a hungry man stole bread or why 
workers, fed up with being pushed around, decided to down tools. What social 
psychology had to explain, however, "is not why the starving individual steals or 
why the exploited individual strikes, but why the majority of starving 
individuals do <i>not</i> steal, and the majority of exploited individuals do 
<i>not</i> strike". Classical sociology could "satisfactorily explain a social 
phenomenon when human thinking and acting serve a rational purpose, when they 
serve the satisfaction of needs and directly express the economic situation. It 
fails, however, when human thinking and acting <i>contradict</i> the economic 
situation, when, in other words, they are irrational".<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">What was new, at the level of revolutionary theory, in this kind 
of concern? Traditional Marxists had always underestimated - and still 
underestimate - the effect of ideas on the material structure of society. Like 
parrots, they repeat that economic infrastructure and ideological 
superstructures mutually interact. But then they proceed to look upon what is 
essentially a dialectical, two-way relationship as an almost exclusively 
one-sided process (economic "base" determining what goes on in the realm of 
ideas). They have never sought concretely to explain how a reactionary political 
doctrine could gain a mass foothold and later set a whole nation in motion (how, 
for instance, in the early 1930s, Nazi ideology rapidly spread throughout all 
layers of German society, the process including the now well documented massive 
desertion of thousands of Communist militants to the ranks of the Nazis).<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> 
In the words of a "heretical" Marxist, Daniel Guérin, author of one of the most 
sophisticated social, economic and psychological interpretations of the fascist 
phenomenon:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Some people believe themselves very 'Marxist' and very 
'materialist' when they neglect human factors and only concern themselves with 
material and economic facts. They accumulate figures, statistics, percentages. 
They study with extreme precision the deep causes of social phenomena. But 
because they don't follow with similar precision how these causes are reflected 
in human consciousness, living reality eludes them. Because they are only 
interested in material factors, they understand absolutely nothing about how the 
deprivations endured by the masses are converted into aspirations of a religious 
type."<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Neglecting this subjective factor in history, such "Marxists" - 
and they constitute today the overwhelming majority of the species - cannot 
explain the lack of correlation between the economic frustrations of the working 
class and its lack of will to put an end to the system which engenders them. 
They do not grasp the fact that when certain beliefs become anchored in the 
thinking (and influence the behaviour) of the masses, they become themselves 
material facts of history.</p>

<p class="fst">What was it therefore, Reich asked, which in the real life of the 
oppressed limited their will to revolution? His answer was that the working 
class was readily influenced by reactionary and irrational ideas because such 
ideas fell on fertile soil.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> 
For the average Marxist, workers were adults who hired their labour power to 
capitalists and were exploited by them. This was correct as far as it went. But 
one had to take into account all aspects of working class life if one wanted to 
understand the political attitudes of the working class. This meant one had to 
recognize some obvious facts, namely that the worker had a childhood, that he 
was brought up by parents themselves conditioned by the society in which they 
lived, that he had a wife and children, sexual needs, frustrations, and family 
conflicts. Overcrowding, physical fatigue, financial insecurity, and back-street 
abortions rendered these problems particularly acute in working-class circles. 
Why should such factors be neglected in seeking to explain working-class 
behaviour? Reich sought to develop a total analysis which would incorporate such 
facts and attach the appropriate importance to them.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">4. The Process of Conditioning</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In learning to obey their parents, children learn obedience in 
general. This deference learned in the family setting will manifest itself 
whenever the child faces a "superior" in later life. Sexual repression - by the 
already sexually repressed parents<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> 
- is an integral part of the conditioning process.</p>

<p class="fst">Rigid and obsessional parents start by imposing rigid feeding 
times on the newborn. They then seek to impose regular potting habits on infants 
scarcely capable of maintaining the sitting posture. They are obsessed by food, 
bowels, and the "inculcating of good eating habits". A little later they will 
start scolding and punishing their masturbating five-year-old. At times they 
will even threaten their male children with physical mutilation.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> 
(They cannot accept that children at that [age] - or any other age for that matter - 
should derive pleasure from sex.) They are horrified at their discovery of 
sexual exhibitionism between consenting juniors in private. Later still, they 
will warn their twelve-year-old boys of the dire dangers of "real masturbation". 
They will watch the clock to see what time their fifteen-year-old daughters get 
home, or search their son's pockets for contraceptives. For most parents, the 
child-rearing years are one long, anti-sexual saga.</p>

<p class="fst">How does the child react to this? He adapts by trial and error. 
He is scolded when he masturbates. He adapts by repressing his sexuality. 
Attempted affirmation of sexual needs then takes the form of revolt against 
parental authority. But this revolt is again punished. Obedience is achieved 
through punishment. Punishment also ensures that forbidden activities are 
invested with feelings of guilt<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> 
which may be (but more often aren't) sufficient to inhibit them.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The anxiety associated with the fulfilment of sexual needs 
becomes part of the anxiety associated with all rebellious thoughts or actions 
(sexuality and all manifestations of rebelliousness are both indiscriminately 
curbed by the "educators"). The child gradually comes to suppress needs whose 
acting out would incur parental displeasure or result in punishment, and ends up 
afraid of his sexual drives and of his tendencies to revolt. At a later stage 
another kind of equilibrium is achieved which has been described as "being torn 
between desires that are repugnant to my conscience and a conscience repugnant 
to my desires".<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> The individual 
is "marked like a road map from head to toes by his repressions".<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the little boy, early repression is associated with an 
identification with the paternal image. In a sense, this is a prefiguration of 
the later "country or party". The father, in this sense, is the representative 
of the state and of authority in the family nucleus.</p>

<p class="fst">To neutralize his sexual needs and his rebellion against his 
parents, the child develops "overcompensations". The unconscious revolt against 
the father engenders servility. The fear of sexuality engenders prudery. We all 
know those old maids of both sexes, ever on the alert against any hint of 
sexuality among children. Their preoccupations are obviously determined by deep 
fears of their own sexuality. The reluctance of most revolutionaries to discuss 
these topics is similarly motivated.</p>

<p class="fst">Another frequent by-product of sexual repression is to split 
sexuality into its component parts. Tenderness is given a positive value, 
whereas sensuality is condemned. A dissociation between affection and sexual 
pleasure is seen in many male adolescents and leads them to adopt double sexual 
standards. They idealize some girl on a pedestal while seeking to satisfy their 
sexual needs with other girls whom they openly or subconsciously despise.</p>

<p class="fst">The road to a healthy sex life for adolescents is blocked by both 
external and internal obstacles. The external obstacles (difficulty in finding 
an undisturbed place, difficulty in escaping from family surveillance, etc.) are 
obvious enough. The internal (psychological) obstacles may, at times, be severe 
enough to influence the perception of the sexual need. The two kinds of 
obstacles (internal and external) mutually reinforce one another. External 
factors consolidate sexual repression and the sexual repression predisposes to 
the influence of the external factors. The family is the hub of this vicious 
circle.</p>

<p class="fst">However apparently successful the repression, the repressed 
material is, of course, still there. But it is now running in subterranean 
channels. Having accepted a given set of "cultural" values, the individual must 
now defend himself against anything that might disrupt the painfully established 
equilibrium. He has constantly to mobilize part of his psychological 
potentialities against the "disturbing" influences. In addition to neuroses and 
psychoses the "energy" expended in this constant repression results in 
difficulties in thought and concentration, in a diminution of awareness and 
probably in some impairment of mental capacity. "Inability to concentrate" is 
perhaps the most common of neurotic symptoms.</p>

<p class="fst">According to Reich, the</p>

<p class="quoteb">"suppression of the natural sexuality in the child, 
particularly of its genital sexuality, makes the child apprehensive, shy, 
obedient, afraid of authority, 'good' and 'adjusted' in the authoritarian sense; 
it paralyzes the rebellious forces because any rebellion is laden with anxiety; 
it produces, by inhibiting sexual curiosity and sexual thinking in the child, a 
general inhibition of thinking and of critical faculties. In brief, the goal of 
sexual repression is that of producing an individual who is adjusted to the 
authoritarian order and who will submit to it in spite of all misery and 
degradation ... The result is fear of freedom, and a conservative, reactionary 
mentality. <i>Sexual repression aids political reaction</i>, <i>not only through 
this process which makes the mass individual passive and unpolitical</i>, <i>but 
also by creating in his structure an interest in actively supporting the 
authoritarian order</i>."<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When a child's upbringing has been completed the individual has 
acquired something more complex and harmful than a simple obedience response to 
those in authority. He has developed a whole system of reactions, regressions, 
thoughts, rationalizations, which form a character structure adapted to the 
authoritarian social system. The purpose of education - both East and West - is 
the mass production of robots of this kind who have so internalized social 
constraints that they submit to them automatically.</p>

<p class="fst">Psychologists and psychiatrists have written pages about the 
<i>medical</i> effects of sexual repression.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> 
Reich however constantly reiterated its <i>social</i> function, exercised 
through the family. The purpose of sexual repression was to anchor submission to 
authority and the fear of freedom into people's "character armour". The net 
result was the reproduction, generation after generation, of the basic 
conditions necessary for the manipulation and enslavement of the masses.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h6">5. The Function of the Family</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In his classical study on <i>The Origin of the Family, Private 
Property and the State</i>, Engels attributes three main functions to the family 
in capitalist society:</p>

<p class="fst">(a) It was a <i>mechanism for the transmission of wealth through 
inheritance</i>, a process which permitted the dominant social groups to 
perpetuate their economic power. This has undoubtedly been an important function 
of the bourgeois family. However Engels's hope that "with the disappearance of 
private property the family would lose its last reason to exist" has not 
materialized. The private ownership of the means of production has been 
abolished in Russia for over fifty years and yet the family (in the compulsive, 
bourgeois sense) still seems deeply embedded both in Russian consciousness and 
in Russian reality. By a strange paradox, it is in the capitalist West that the 
bourgeois family is being submitted to the most radical critique - in both 
theory and practice.</p>

<p class="fst">(b) The family was also a unit <i>of economic production</i>, 
particularly in the countryside and in petty trade. Large-scale industry and the 
general drift to the towns characteristic of the twentieth century have markedly 
reduced the significance of this function.</p>

<p class="fst">(c) The family was finally <i>a mechanism for the propagation of 
the human species</i>. This statement is also correct, in relation to a whole 
period of human history. It should not, of course, be taken to imply that, were 
it not for the civil or religious marriages of the bourgeois type (what Engels 
called "those permits to practise sex") the propagation of the human species 
would abruptly cease! Other types of relationships (more or less lasting, 
monogamous - or otherwise - while they last) are certainly conceivable. In a 
communist society technological changes and new living patterns would largely do 
away with household chores. The bringing up of children would probably not be 
the exclusive function of one pair of individuals for more than a short time. 
What are usually given as psychological reasons for the perpetuation of the 
compulsive marriage are often just rationalizations.</p>

<p class="fst">Engels's comments about the family, partly valid as they still 
are (and valid as they may have been) don't really allow one to grasp the full 
significance of this institution. They ignore a whole dimension of life. 
Classical psychoanalysis hinted at a further function: the transmission of the 
dominant cultural pattern. Revolutionary psychoanalysis was to take this concept 
much further.</p>

<p class="fst">Freud himself had pointed out that the parents brought up their 
children according to the dictates of their own (the parents') superegos:<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">"In general parents and similar authorities follow the 
dictates of their own superegos in the upbringing of children. ... In the 
education of the child they are severe and exacting. They have forgotten the 
difficulties of their own childhood, and are glad to be able to identify 
themselves fully at last with their own parents, who in their day subjected them 
to such severe restraints. The result is that the superego of the child is not 
really built upon the model of the parents but on that of the parents' superego. 
It takes over the same content, it becomes the vehicle of tradition and of all 
the age-long values which have been handed down in this way from generation to 
generation ... Mankind never lives completely in the present; the ideologies of 
the superego perpetuate the past, the traditions of the race and the people, 
which yield but slowly to the influence of the present and to new developments. 
So long as they work through the superego, they play an important part in man's 
life, quite independently of economic conditions."<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Reich was to develop these ideas to explain the lag between class 
consciousness and economic reality, and the tremendous social inertia 
represented by habits of deference and submission among the oppressed. In order 
to do this he had to launch a frontal attack on the institution of the bourgeois 
family, an assault which was to provoke heated attacks on him. These were to be 
launched not only by reactionaries and religious bigots of all kinds, but also 
by orthodox psychoanalysts<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> and 
by orthodox Marxists.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">"As the economic basis (of the family) became less significant", 
Reich wrote, "its place was taken by the political function which the family now 
began to assume. Its cardinal function, that for which it is mostly supported 
and defended by conservative science and law, is that of serving as a <i>factory 
for authoritarian ideologies and conservative structures</i>. It forms the 
educational apparatus through which practically every individual of our society, 
from the moment of drawing his first breath, has to pass ... <i>it is the 
conveyor belt between the economic structure of conservative society and its 
ideological</i> superstructure".<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Reich probed ruthlessly into familial behaviour. The 
predominating type (the "lower-middle-class" family) extended high up the social 
scale, but even further down into the class of industrial workers. Its basis was 
"the relation of the patriarchal father to his wife and children ... because of 
the contradiction between his position in the productive process (subordinate) 
and his family function (boss) he is a sergeant-major type. He kowtows to those 
above, absorbs the prevailing attitudes (hence his tendency to imitation) and 
dominates those below. He transmits the governmental and social concepts and 
enforces them".<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> The process is 
"mitigated in the industrial workers' milieu by the fact that the children are 
much less supervised".<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Nearly all reactionaries clearly perceive that sexual freedom 
would subvert the compulsive marriage and with it the authoritarian structure of 
which the family is a part. (The attitude of the Greek colonels towards 
miniskirts, co-education and "permissive" literature would be a textbook example 
of what we are talking about.) Sexual inhibitions must therefore be anchored in 
the young.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Authoritarian society is not concerned about 'morality per 
se'. Rather, the anchoring of sexual morality and the changes it brings about in 
the organism create that specific psychic structure which forms the 
mass-psychological basis of any authoritarian social order. The vassal-structure 
is a mixture of sexual impotence, helplessness, longing for a Fuhrer, fear of 
authority, fear of life, and mysticism. It is characterized by devout loyalty 
and simultaneous rebellion ... People with such a structure are incapable of 
democratic living. Their structure nullifies all attempts at establishing or 
maintaining organizations run along truly democratic principles.<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> 
They form the mass-psychological soil on which the dictatorial or bureaucratic 
tendencies of their democratically elected leaders can develop."<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A class society can only function as long as those it exploits 
accept their exploitation. The statement would seem so obvious as hardly to need 
elaboration. Yet there are, on the political scene today, groups who maintain 
that the conditions are "rotten ripe for revolution" and that only the lack of 
an appropriate leadership prevents the revolutionary masses, yearning for a 
total transformation of their conditions of life, from carrying out such a 
revolution. Unfortunately, this is very far from being the case. In an empirical 
way even Lenin perceived this. In April 1917 he wrote: "The bourgeoisie 
maintains itself not only by force, but also by the lack of consciousness, by 
the force of custom and habit among the masses".<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is obvious that if large sections of the population were 
constantly questioning the principles of hierarchy, the authoritarian 
organization of production, the wages system, or other fundamental aspects of 
the social structure, no ruling class could maintain itself in power for long. 
For rulers to continue ruling it is necessary that those at the bottom of the 
social ladder not only accept their condition, but eventually lose even the 
sense of being exploited. Once this psychological process has been achieved the 
division of society becomes legitimized in peoples' minds. The exploited cease 
to perceive it as something imposed on them from without. The oppressed have 
internalized their own oppression. They tend to behave like robots, programmed 
not to rebel against the established order. The robots may even seek to defend 
their subordinate position, to rationalize it and will often reject as 
"pie-in-the-sky" any talk of emancipation. They are often impermeable to 
progressive ideas. Only at times of occasional insurrectionary outbursts do the 
rulers have to resort to force, as a kind of reinforcement of a conditioning 
stimulus. Reich describes this process as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"It is not merely a matter of imposing ideologies, attitudes 
and concepts on the members of society. It is a matter of a deep-reaching 
process in each new generation of the formation of a psychic structure which 
corresponds to the existing social order, in all strata of the population ... 
Because this order moulds the psychic structure of all members of society it 
reproduces itself in people ... <i>the first and most important place of 
reproduction of the social order is the patriarchal family</i> which creates in 
children a character which makes them amenable to the later influence of an 
authoritarian order ... this characteriological anchoring of the social order 
explains the tolerance of the suppressed toward the rule of the upper class, a 
tolerance which sometimes goes as far as the affirmation of their own 
subjugation ... The investigation of character structure, therefore, is of more 
than clinical interest. It leads to the question why it is that ideologies 
change so much more slowly than the socio-economic base, why man as a rule lags 
so far behind what he creates and which should and could change him. The reason 
is that the character structure is acquired in early childhood and undergoes 
little change."<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">To return to the title of this pamphlet, it is this collective 
character structure, this "protective" armour of rigid and stereotyped reactions 
and thoughts, which determines the irrational behaviour of individuals, groups 
or large masses of people. In the words of Spinoza our job is "neither to laugh 
nor to weep, but to understand". It is in this collective character structure of 
the masses that one might find explanations for the proletariat's lack of class 
consciousness, for its acceptance of the established order, for its ready 
endorsement of reactionary ideas, for its participation in imperialist wars. It 
is also here that one should seek the cause of dogmatism, of religious attitudes 
in politics, of conservatism among "revolutionaries" and of the anxieties 
generated by the new. It is here that one should seek the roots of "the 
irrational in politics".</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h7">6. The Historical Roots</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Not all human societies are - or have been - sexually repressed. 
There is considerable evidence that the sexual ethos and mores of certain early 
societies - and of certain "primitive" societies today - are very different from 
those of "modern, western man".</p>

<p class="fst">It is impossible to understand how or why sexual repression 
originated - and what influences maintain, enhance or weaken it - without seeing 
the problem in a much wider context, namely that of the historical evolution of 
relations between the sexes, in particular of the evolution of such human 
relationships as kinship and marriage. These are the central concerns of modern 
social anthropology.</p>

<p class="fst">The whole subject is like a minefield, littered with 
methodological and terminological trip wires. About a hundred years ago a number 
of important books were published which shook established thinking to the roots 
in that they questioned the immutability of human institutions and behaviour.<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a> 
The authors of these books played an important role in the history of 
anthropology. They sought to put the subject on a firm historical basis. They 
pointed out important connections between forms of marriage and sexual customs 
on the one hand and - on the other hand - such factors as the level of 
technology, the inheritance of property, and the authority relations prevailing 
within various social groups, etc. They founded the whole study of kinship and 
gave it its terminology. But carried away in the great scientific and 
rationalist euphoria of the late nineteenth century these authors generalized 
far beyond what was permissible on the basis of the available data. They 
constructed great schemes and drew conclusions about the history of mankind 
which some modern experts have politely described as "famous pseudo-historical 
speculations"<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a> and others as 
"quite staggeringly without foundation".<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a></p>

<p class="fst">We will now briefly summarize these "classical" conceptions (in 
relation to the areas which concern us) with a view to commenting on what is 
still valid within them, what is dubious and what can no longer be accepted in 
the light of modern knowledge.</p>

<p class="fst">In primitive societies the level of technology was very low and 
there was no surplus product to be appropriated by non-productive sections of 
the community. There was an elementary, "biological" division of labour: the 
men, who were stronger, went out hunting or sowed the fields; the women prepared 
the meals and looked after the children. It was held that in these societies 
"group marriages" were common. As a result it was difficult or impossible to 
know the father of any particular child. The mother, of course, was always known 
and descent was therefore acknowledged in matrilinear terms. Such societies were 
described as "matriarchal". With improvements in technology (the discovery of 
bronze and copper, the smelting of iron ore, the manufacture of implements, the 
development of new methods of soil cultivation and of rearing cattle) it soon 
became possible for "two arms to produce more than one mouth could consume". War 
and the capture of slaves became a meaningful proposition. The economic role of 
the men in the tribe soon assumed a preponderance which was no longer in keeping 
with their equivocal social status. In Engels's words:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"as wealth increased, it on the one hand gave the man a more 
important status in the family than the woman, and on the other hand it created 
a stimulus to utilize this strengthened position to overthrow the traditional 
order of inheritance in favour of his children. But this was impossible as long 
as descent according to mother-right prevailed."<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">According to the "classical" theory a profound change then took 
place, probably spread over many centuries, which Engels described as "the world 
historic defeat of the female sex".<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a> 
The males gradually became the dominant sex, both economically and socially. 
Women became a commodity to be exchanged against cattle or weapons. With further 
changes in the productivity of labour, a definite social surplus was now being 
produced. Those who had access to this surplus sought to institutionalize their 
right to it as "private property" and to leave part of it to their descendants. 
But to do this they had to know who their descendants were. Hence the appearance 
of the patriarchal family, of monogamous marriage, and of a sexual morality 
which stressed female chastity and which demanded of women virginity before 
marriage and faithfulness during it. Female unfaithfulness becomes a crime 
punishable by death for it allows doubts to arise as to the legitimacy of the 
descendants.</p>

<p class="fst">What is false in this schema is the notion - often explicitly 
stated - that the whole of mankind went through a series of states characterized 
by specific forms of social organization and specific patterns of inheritance.</p>

<p class="fst">There is little evidence that societies based on "matriarchy"<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a> 
or even on "mother-right" were universally dominant forms. It is wrong to regard 
any contemporary tribe in which matrilinear descent still pertains as some kind 
of fossil, arrested at an earlier stage of evolutionary development.<a href="#n39" name="fn39" target="_self">[39]</a> 
It is also wrong to associate specific marriage forms with specific levels of 
technological development ("group marriage" for "savage society", "the 
syndiasmic family" for "barbarism", "the monogamous marriage" for 
"civilization", etc.). This is not to say that kinship systems are arbitrary. 
They are adaptable and have certainly been adapted to fulfil varying human 
needs. These "needs" have differed widely according to population density, 
climatic conditions, land fertility, and numerous other variables, known and 
unknown. The alternatives "patriarchal"-"matriarchal" are moreover extremely 
naive.<a href="#n40" name="fn40" target="_self">[40]</a> We now know that we 
must distinguish between matrilinear, patrilinear or "cognatic" (kinship through 
both lines) patterns of inheritance and between matrilocal and patrilocal (who 
lives where?) patterns of abode, and that these in turn exercise considerable 
influence on social and sexual mores. There are also differences between 
person-to-person relationships and obligations (inheritance, etc.) and group 
obligations (in relation to common or impartible land, to ancestor worship, to 
"duties" to avenge death, etc.) and these may conflict. Reality is extremely 
complex in its manifestations and these cannot today be as readily "tidied up" 
as they were in the past. Moreover the "very rigidity of the [classical] 
theories makes them difficult to use and is in stark contrast to the 
malleability of human beings".<a href="#n41" name="fn41" target="_self">[41]</a></p>

<p class="fst">What remains therefore of the classical schema? Firstly, the 
intellectual courage and ambition of seeking to grasp reality in its totality 
and of not seeking refuge behind the complexity of facts to proclaim the 
incoherence of nature. When one hears that "modern anthropology" has 
"invalidated Morgan" one is reminded of oft-heard verdicts that "modern 
sociology" has "invalidated Marx". At one level this is true but there is also a 
deliberately entertained confusion between perspective and detail, between 
method and content, between intention and fulfilment.</p>

<p class="fst">At the more specific level it remains true that the appearance of 
a social surplus led to a struggle for its appropriation and to attempts to 
restrict its dispersal by institutionalized means. It is also true that by and 
large this process was associated with a progressive restriction of female 
sexual rights and with the appearance of an increasingly authoritarian morality. 
Although some matrilinear societies may have been sexually inhibited, and 
although not all patriarchal societies are necessarily repressive, it remains 
true that by and large the more widespread the "patriarchal" functions the more 
repressive the societies have been. Modern psychoanalysis may throw further 
light on the mechanisms whereby this came about. At this point we can only 
pinpoint an area that badly needs to be studied.</p>

<p class="fst">The "inferior" status of women soon came to be widely accepted. 
Over the centuries, throughout slave society, feudal society and capitalist 
society - but also in the many parts of the world which have not gone through 
this sequence - a whole ethos, a whole philosophy and a whole set of social 
customs were to emerge which consecrated this subordinate relationship, both in 
real life and in the minds of both men and women.</p>

<p class="fst">The sacred texts of the Hindus limit women's access to freedom 
and to material belongings. The Ancient Greeks were profoundly misogynist and 
relegated their women to the gynecaeum. Pythagoras speaks of "a good principle 
which created order, light and man - and a bad principle which created chaos, 
darkness and woman". Demosthenes proclaimed that "one took a wife to have 
legitimate children, concubines to be well looked after and courtesans for the 
pleasures of physical love". Plato in his <i>Republic</i> declares that "the 
most holy marriages are those which are of most benefit to the State". The 
fathers of the Christian Church soon succeeded in destroying the early hopes of 
freedom and emancipation which had led many women to martyrdom. Women became 
synonymous with eternal temptation. They are seen as a constant "invitation to 
fornication, a trap for the unwary". St. Paul states that "man was not created 
for woman, but woman for man". St. John Chrysostome proclaims that "among all 
wild beasts, none are as dangerous as women". According to St. Thomas Aquinas 
"woman is destined to live under man's domination and has no authority of her 
own right".</p>

<p class="fst">These attitudes are perpetuated in the dominant ideology of the 
Middle Ages and even into more recent times. Milton, in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, 
proclaims that "man was made for God and woman was made for man". Schopenhauer 
defines woman as "an animal with long hair and short ideas", and Nietzsche calls 
her "the warrior's pastime". Even the muddleheaded Proudhon sees her as 
"housewife or courtesan" and proclaims that "neither by nature nor destiny can 
woman be an associate, a citizen or a holder of public office". Kaiser Wilhelm 
the Second defined a role for women (later echoed by the Third Reich) as being "<i>Kirche</i>, 
<i>Küche</i>, <i>Kinder</i>" (Church, Kitchen and Kids).</p>

<p class="fst">In 1935 Wilhelm Reich wrote a major work, <i>Der Einbruch der 
sexual-moral</i>, which discussed how an authoritarian sexual morality 
developed. In it Reich discusses some interesting observations of Malinowski's 
concerning the inhabitants of the Trobriand Islands (off Eastern New Guinea), 
where matrilinear forms of kinship prevailed. (Reich had met Malinowski in 
London in 1934.) Among the Trobrianders there was free sexual play during 
childhood and considerable sexual freedom during adolescence. Tics and neuroses 
were virtually unknown and the general attitude to life was easy and relaxed. 
Reich discusses however the practice whereby, among the ruling groups, certain 
girls were encouraged to marry their first cousins (the sons of their mother's 
brother), thereby enabling marriage settlements to be recuperated and remain 
within the family. Whereas sexual freedom was widespread among all other young 
Trobrianders, those destined for a marriage of this kind were submitted from an 
early age to all sorts of sexual taboos. Economic interests - the accumulation 
of wealth within the ruling group - determined restrictions of sexual freedom 
within this group.</p>

<p class="fst">Reich vividly contrasts the Trobrianders and other sexually 
uninhibited societies with classical patriarchal societies which produce mass 
neurosis and mass misery through sexual repression. With the strengthening of 
patriarchy:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the family acquires, in addition to its economic function, 
the far more significant function of changing the human structure from that of 
the free clan member to that of the suppressed family member ... the 
relationship between clan members, which was free and voluntary, based only on 
common vital interests, is replaced by a conflict between economic and sexual 
interests. Voluntary achievement in work is replaced by compulsive work and 
rebellion against it. Natural sexual sociality is replaced by the demands of 
morality; voluntary, happy love relationship is replaced by genital repression, 
neurotic disturbances and sexual perversions; the naturally strong, self-reliant 
biological organism becomes weak, helpless, dependent, fearful of God; the 
orgiastic experiencing of nature is replaced by mystical ecstasy, 'religious 
experience' and unfulfilled vegetative longing; the weakened ego of the 
individual seeks strength in the identification with the tribe, later the 
'nation', and with the chief of the tribe, later the patriarch of the tribe and 
the king of the nation.<a href="#n42" name="fn42" target="_self">[42]</a> With 
that the birth of the vassal structure has taken place; the structural anchoring 
of human subjugation is secured."<a href="#n43" name="fn43" target="_self">[43]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h8">7. Wilhelm Reich and the Sexual Revolution</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Those who want to change society must seek to understand how 
people act and think in society. This is not a field in which traditional 
revolutionaries are at home. For reasons we have shown they feel distinctly 
uncomfortable in it. Reich's views on sexual conditioning are certainly of 
relevance here, whatever one may think of other aspects of his work.<a href="#n44" name="fn44" target="_self">[44]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Some possible misunderstandings should be cleared up immediately. 
We are not saying that the sexual revolution is <i>the</i> revolution. We have 
not abandoned the fight for the Revolution to become "prophets of the better 
orgasm". We are not in transit from collective revolutionary politics to 
individual sexual emancipation. We are not saying that sexual factors are to be 
<i>substituted</i> for economic ones in the understanding of social reality or that 
understanding sexual repression will automatically generate an insight into the 
mechanisms of exploitation and alienation which are at the root of class 
society. Nor are we endorsing Reich's later writings, whether in the field of 
biology or in the field of politics.</p>

<p class="fst">What we <i>are</i> saying is that revolution is a total 
phenomenon or it is nothing,<a href="#n45" name="fn45" target="_self">[45]</a> 
that a social revolution which is not <i>also</i> 
a sexual revolution is unlikely to have gone much below the surface of things 
and that sexual emancipation is not something that will "come later", 
"automatically" or as a "by-product" of a revolution in other aspects of 
peoples' lives. We are stressing that no "understanding" of social reality can 
be total which neglects the sexual factors and that sexual repression itself has 
both economic origins and social effects. We are trying to explain some of the 
difficulties confronting revolutionaries and some of the real problems they are 
up against - here and now. We are finally trying to explain why the task of the 
purely "industrial" militant or of the purely "political" revolutionary is so 
difficult, unrewarding and in the long run sterile.</p>

<p class="fst">Unless revolutionaries are clearly aware of <i>all</i> the 
resistances they are up against, how can they hope to break them down? Unless 
revolutionaries are clearly aware of the resistances (i.e., the unsuspected 
influences of the dominant ideology) within themselves, how can they hope to 
come to grips with the problems of others?</p>

<p class="fst">How much of the life of the ordinary person is devoted to 
"politics" (even in basic terms of organized economic struggle) and how much to 
problems of interpersonal relationships? To ask the question is already to 
provide an answer. Yet just look at the average Left political literature today. 
Reading the columns of the <i>Morning Star</i>, <i>Workers' Press</i> or 
<i>Socialist Standard</i> one doesn't get a hint that the problems discussed in 
this pamphlet even exist. Man is seen as a ridiculous fragment of his full 
stature. One seldom gets the impression that the traditional revolutionaries are 
talking about real people, whose problems in relation to wives, parents, 
companions or children occupy at least as much of their lives as their struggle 
against economic exploitation. Marxists sometimes state (but more often just 
imply) that a change in the property relations (or in the relations of 
production) will initiate a process which will eventually solve the emotional 
problems of mankind (an end to sexual misery through a change in the 
leadership?). This does not follow in the least. If Marx is right, that 
"socialism is man's positive self-consciousness", the struggle at the level of 
sexual emancipation must be waged in explicit terms and victory not just left to 
happen (or not happen) in the wake of economic change. It is difficult, however, 
to convince the average revolutionary of this. Their own "character armour" 
renders them impervious to the basic needs of many of those on whose behalf they 
believe they are acting. They are afraid to politicize the sexual question 
because they are afraid of what is in themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">What are the practical implications of the ideas we have here 
outlined? Can the sexual revolution take place within a capitalist context? Can 
a total revolution take place while people are still sexually repressed? We 
hope, in this section, to show that even posing the question in these terms is 
wrong and that there is a profound dialectical relation between the two which 
should never be lost sight of.</p>

<p class="fst">Reich originally hoped it might be possible to eliminate people's 
neuroses by education, explanation and a change in their sexual habits. But he 
soon came to realize that it was a waste of time to line patients up for the 
analyst's couch if society was producing neuroses faster than analysts were 
capable of coping with them. Capitalist society was a mass-production industry 
as far as neuroses were concerned. And where it did not produce well-defined 
clinically recognizable neuroses, it often produced "adaptations" that crippled 
the individual by compelling him to submit. (In modern society submission and 
adaptation are often the price paid for avoiding an individual neurosis.) 
Growing awareness of this fact led Reich increasingly to question the whole 
pattern of social organization and to draw revolutionary conclusions. He came to 
see that "the sexual problem" was deeply related to authoritarian social 
structures and could not be solved short of overthrowing the established order.</p>

<p class="fst">At this point many would have abandoned psychoanalysis for 
radical politics of the classical type. What makes Reich such an interesting and 
original thinker is that he also perceived the converse, namely that it would be 
impossible fundamentally to alter the existing social order as long as people 
were conditioned (through sexual repression and an authoritarian upbringing) 
into accepting the fundamental norms of the society around them. Reich joined 
the Austrian Communist Party in July 1927 following the shootings in 
Schattendorf and Vienna.<a href="#n46" name="fn46" target="_self">[46]</a> He 
participated in meetings, leafletting, demonstrations, etc. But he 
simultaneously continued to develop revolutionary psychoanalysis, guiding it 
into biologically uncharted territory. He took it from where it ceased to be a 
comfortable profession into areas where it began to be a dangerous occupation. 
He set up free sexual hygiene clinics in the working-class districts of Vienna. 
These proved extremely popular. They gave Reich a very deep insight not only 
into the sexual and economic misery of the population, but also into "the 
acquired irrational structure of the masses" which made "dictatorship through 
utilization of the irrational possible".<a href="#n47" name="fn47" target="_self">[47]</a> 
In Reich's writings "man" as patient and "man" as social being merged more and 
more into one. Reich's very experiences in politics (the endorsement and 
"justification" of police brutality by large sections of the Austrian 
population, the acceptance of authority even by the starving, the relatively 
easy accession to power by the Nazis in Germany, the triumph of the "political 
pirates" over the "repressed and hungry masses") led him to question ever more 
deeply the mechanisms whereby the dominant ideology permeated the ranks of the 
oppressed, to search ever more thoroughly for the roots of the "irrational in 
politics".</p>

<p class="fst">Reich's conclusions have already been indicated: people's 
character structure prevents them from becoming aware of their real interests. 
The fear of freedom, the longing for order (of any kind), the panic at the 
thought of being deprived of a leader, the anxiety with which they confront 
pleasure or new ideas, the distress caused by having to think for oneself, all 
act against any wish at social emancipation. "Now we understand", Reich wrote, 
"a basic element in the 'retroaction of ideology on the economic base'. Sexual 
inhibition alters the structure of the economically suppressed individual in 
such a manner that he thinks, feels and acts against his own material 
interests".</p>

<p class="fst">It might be thought that only pessimistic conclusions could flow 
from such an analysis. If a rational attitude to sexuality is impossible under 
capitalism (because the continuation of capitalism precludes the development of 
rationality in general), and if no real social change is possible as long as 
people are sexually repressed (because this conditions their acceptance of 
authority) the outlook would seem bleak indeed, in relation to both sexual and 
social revolutions.</p>

<p class="fst">Cattier's biography of Reich contains a passage which brilliantly 
illustrates this dilemma:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"When Reich was with his patients he had noticed that they 
would mobilize all their defence reactions against him. They would hang on to 
their neurotic equilibrium and experience fear as the analyst got near the 
repressed material. In the same way revolutionary ideas slither off the 
character armour of the masses because such ideas are appealing to everything 
that people had had to smother within themselves in order to put up with their 
own brutalization.</p>

<p class="quoteb">It would be wrong to believe that working people fail to 
revolt because they lack information about the mechanisms of economic 
exploitation. In fact revolutionary propaganda which seeks to explain to the 
masses the social injustice and irrationality of the economic system falls on 
deaf ears. Those who get up at five in the morning to work in a factory, and 
have on top of it to spend two hours of every day on underground or suburban 
trains, have to adapt to these conditions by eliminating from their minds 
anything that might put such conditions in question again. If they realized that 
they were wasting their lives in the service of an absurd system they would 
either go mad or commit suicide. To avoid achieving such anxiety-laden insight 
they justify their existence by rationalizing it.<a href="#n48" name="fn48" target="_self">[48]</a> 
They repress everything that might disturb them and acquire a character 
structure adapted to the conditions under which they must live. Hence it follows 
that the idealistic tactic consisting of explaining to people that they were 
oppressed is useless, as people have had to suppress the perception of 
oppression in order to live with it. Revolutionary propagandists often claim 
they are trying to raise people's level of consciousness. Experience shows that 
their endeavours are seldom successful. Why? Because such endeavours come up 
against all the unconscious defence mechanisms and against all the various 
rationalizations that people have built up in order not to become aware of the 
exploitation and of the void in their lives."</p>

<p class="fst">This sombre image has far more truth in it than most 
revolutionaries can comfortably admit. But in the last analysis it is 
inadequate. It is inadequate because it implies totally malleable individuals, 
in whom total sexual repression has produced the prerequisites for total 
conditioning and therefore for total acceptance of the dominant ideology. The 
image is inadequate because it is undialectical. It does not encompass the 
possibility that attitudes might change, that the "laws" governing psychological 
mechanisms might alter, that a fight against sexual repression (dictated by 
sexual needs themselves) might loosen the "character armour" of individuals and 
render them more capable of rational thought and action. In a sense the model 
described implies a vision of psychological reactions as something unalterable 
and fixed, governed by objective laws which operate independently of the actions 
or wishes of men. In this sense it bears a strange similarity to the image of 
capitalism present in the mind of so many revolutionaries.<a href="#n49" name="fn49" target="_self">[49]</a> 
But neither the external nor the internal world of man in fact exist in this 
form. The working class does not submit to its history, until one day it makes 
it explode. Its continuous struggle in production constantly modifies the area 
in which the next phase of the struggle will have to be fought. Much the same 
applies to man's struggle for sexual freedom.</p>

<p class="fst">Reich himself was aware of this possibility. In the preface to 
the first edition of <i>Character Analysis</i> (1933) he wrote: "Gradually, with 
the development of the social process, there develops an increasing discrepancy 
between enforced renunciation and increased libidinal tension: <i>this 
discrepancy undermines 'tradition' and forms the psychological core attitudes 
which threaten the anchoring</i>".</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h9">8. Limits and Perspectives</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The "undermining of tradition" to which Reich referred has 
certainly progressed within recent years. The change in traditional attitudes is 
both gaining momentum and becoming more explicit in a manner which would have 
surprised and delighted Reich. Seeing the havoc around him in the working-class 
districts of Vienna and Berlin (in the late 1920s and early 1930s) Reich wrote 
brilliant and bitter pages about the sexual misery of adolescence, about the 
damage done to the personality by guilt about masturbation, about ignorance and 
misinformation concerning birth control, about the high cost of contraceptives, 
about back-street abortions (so often the fate of the working-class girl or the 
housewife) and about the hypocrisy of the "compulsive" bourgeois marriage with 
its inevitable concomitant of jealousy, adultery and prostitution. Real sexual 
freedom for the young, Reich wrote, would mean the end of this type of marriage. 
Bourgeois society needed bourgeois marriage for one of the cornerstones of its 
edifice. For Reich any large-scale sexual freedom was inconceivable within the 
framework of capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">What has happened has been rather different from anything Reich 
could have forseen. In advanced industrial societies the persistent struggle of 
the young for what is one of their fundamental rights - the right to a normal 
sex life from the age at which they are capable of it - has succeeded in denting 
the repressive ideology, in bringing about changes and in modifying the ground 
on which the next stage of the struggle will have to be fought. Adolescents are 
breaking out of the stifling atmosphere of the traditional family, an act which 
could be of considerable significance. Information and practical help about 
birth control is now available, even to the non-married. The increasing 
financial independence of young people and the discovery of oral contraception 
provide a solid material foundation for the whole process. The attitude to 
"illegitimacy" is gradually changing. The upbringing of children is more 
enlightened. Abortion is now more widely available, divorce much easier and the 
economic rights of women more widely recognized. Understanding is increasing. 
People are beginning to grasp that society itself engenders the antisocial 
behaviour which it condemns. It is true that all this has only been achieved on 
a small scale, only in some countries<a href="#n50" name="fn50" target="_self">[50]</a> 
and only in the face of tremendous opposition. It is also true that, as in 
Reich's day, every concession is "too late and too little", belatedly 
recognizing established facts rather than blazing a new trail. Moreover none of 
the "reformers" are as yet demystified or unrepressed enough to boldly trumpet 
the message that sex is a natural and pleasurable activity - or that the right 
to sexual happiness is a basic human right. It is rarely proclaimed that 
throughout history the practice of sex has never had procreation as its main 
end, whatever the preachings of moralists, priests, philosophers or politicians. 
But despite these limitations the fact of a developing sexual revolution is 
undeniable, irreversible and of deep significance.</p>

<p class="fst">As in other areas, the attempt at sexual emancipation encounters 
two kinds of response from established society: frontal opposition - from those 
who still live in the Victorian era - and an attempt at recuperation. Modern 
society seeks first to neutralize any threat presented to it, and ultimately to 
convert such challenges into something useful to its own ends. It seeks to 
regain with one hand what it has been compelled to yield with the other: parts 
of its control of the total situation.</p>

<p class="fst">In relation to sex, the phenomenon of recuperation takes the form 
of first alienating and reifying sexuality, and then of frenetically exploiting 
this empty shell for commercial ends. As modern youth breaks out of the dual 
stranglehold of repressive traditional morality and of the authoritarian 
patriarchal family it encounters a projected image of free sexuality which is in 
fact a manipulatory distortion of it. The image is often little more than a 
means of selling products. Today sex is used to sell everything from cigarettes 
to real estate, from bottles of perfume to pay-as-you-earn holidays; from hair 
lotions to models of next year's car. The potential market is systematically 
surveyed, quantified, exploited. The "pornographic" explosion on Broadway (New 
York) now caters for a previously repressed clientele of massive proportions and 
varied tastes. Here as elsewhere it is often a question of consumer research. 
Separate booths and displays are arranged for homosexuals (active and passive), 
for fetishists, for sadists, for masochists, for voyeurs, etc. Fashion 
advertising, striptease shows and certain magazines and movies all highlight the 
successful development of sex into a major consumer industry.</p>

<p class="fst">In all this sex is presented as something to be consumed. But the 
sexual instinct differs from certain other instincts. Hunger can be satisfied by 
food. The "food" of the sexual instinct is, however, another human being, 
capable of thinking, acting, suffering. The alienation of sexuality under the 
conditions of modern capitalism is very much part of the general alienating 
process, in which people are converted into objects (in this case, objects of 
sexual consumption) and relations are drained of human content. 
Undiscriminating, compulsive sexual activity is not sexual freedom - although it 
may sometimes be a preparation for it (which repressive morality can never be). 
The illusion that alienated sex is sexual freedom constitutes yet another 
obstacle in the road to total emancipation. Sexual freedom implies a realization 
and understanding of the autonomy of others. Unfortunately, most people don't 
yet think in this way.</p>

<p class="fst">The recuperation by society of the sexual revolution is therefore 
partly successful. But it creates the basis for a deeper and more fundamental 
challenge. Modern society can tolerate alienated sexuality, just as it tolerates 
alienated consumption, wage increases which do not exceed increases in the 
productivity of labour, or colonial "freedom" in which the "facts of economic 
life" still perpetuate the division of the world into "haves" and "have nots". 
Modern capitalism not only tolerates these "challenges" but converts them into 
essential cogs of its own expansion and perpetuation. It seeks to harness the 
sexual demands of youth by first distorting them and then by integrating them 
into the present system, in much the same way as working class demands are 
integrated into the economy of the consumer society. From a potential liberating 
force these demands tend thereby to be converted into a further mechanism of 
repression. What exploiting society will not long be able to tolerate, however, 
is the mass development of critical, demystified, self-reliant, sexually 
emancipated, autonomous, non-alienated persons, conscious of what they want and 
prepared to struggle for it.</p>

<p class="fst">The assertion of the right to manage one's own life, in the realm 
of sex as in the realm of work, is helping to disintegrate the dominant 
ideology. It is producing less compulsive and obsessional individuals, and in 
this respect preparing the ground for libertarian revolution. (In the long run 
even the traditional revolutionaries, that repository of repressed puritanism, 
will be affected.)</p>

<p class="fst">The incessant questioning and challenge to authority on the 
subject of sex and of the compulsive family can only complement the questioning 
and challenge to authority in other areas (for instance on the subject of who is 
to dominate the work process - or of the purpose of work itself). Both 
challenges stress the autonomy of individuals and their domination over 
important aspects of their lives. Both expose the alienated concepts which pass 
for rationality and which govern so much of our thinking and behaviour. The task 
of the conscious revolutionary is to make both challenges explicit, to point out 
their deeply subversive content, and to explain their inter-relation. To 
understand revolutionary psychoanalysis is to add a new dimension to the Marxist 
critique of ideologies and to the Marxist understanding of false consciousness. 
Only then will we have the tools to master our own history, will socialism 
("man's positive self-consciousness") be a real possibility, and will man be 
able to break once and for all with the "irrational in politics" and with the 
irrational in life.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h10">The Russian Experience</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In the years following the Russian Revolution, "official" thought 
and action concerning sexual matters were coloured by four main facts:</p>

<p class="fst">(a) The novelty, depth and vast scale of the problems which the 
Bolsheviks had inherited. The new tasks had to be tackled at a time when 
innumerable other problems claimed urgent attention. In the struggle for sexual 
freedom classical Marxist teaching provided no blueprint as to "what was to be 
done". Despite the vast social intellectual and cultural turmoil, despite the 
widespread breaking up of families and despite the disintegration of many 
traditional values, there was no clear or coherent vision as to what ought 
eventually to follow.</p>

<p class="fst">(b) This lack of conscious purpose was associated with a 
widespread, false, and rather naive belief that the abolition of economic 
exploitation and the promulgation of new, progressive legislation were 
sufficient to ensure the liberation of women. It was thought that this 
liberation (often conceived of in the restrictive sense of "equal rights") would 
automatically follow the changes in the ownership of property and it was assumed 
that its growth would be guaranteed by the new laws and institutions of the 
"workers' state".</p>

<p class="fst">(c) There was massive unawareness of the significance of sexual 
repression - and of the traditional morality based upon it - as a central factor 
in social conditioning. Only a small minority of revolutionaries saw a 
<i>conscious</i> sexual revolution as the indispensable means of deepening and 
completing the proposed social transformation, through changing the mental 
structure of the mass individual.</p>

<p class="fst">(d) Among many of the Bolshevik leaders there was a gross lack of 
insight as to their own repressive conditioning in matters of sex and as to the 
impact this could be having on their thoughts and actions. Many had had a fairly 
typical authoritarian upbringing. Later, deportation, imprisonment and struggle 
under conditions of persecution and illegality had prevented most of the Old 
Guard from enjoying a normal sex life. After the Revolution a retrospective 
virtue was made out of what had been a historical necessity, and this 
"dedication" was made an ideal not only for "the vanguard" but for the masses 
themselves. Many leading Bolsheviks considered propaganda for sexual freedom as 
a "diversion from the real struggle". (So do many would-be Bolsheviks today!) 
Some of them were actively to oppose all attempts at such propaganda. These 
various factors were to play their part in the series of internal defeats that 
followed the great events of 1917. They were to undermine important areas of 
human freedom, conquered in the first few months of the Revolution. The 
inhibition of the sexual revolution in Russia was to combine with other defeats 
(discussed at length elsewhere)<a href="#n51" name="fn51" target="_self">[51]</a> 
to reinforce the whole process of bureaucratic degeneration.</p>

<p class="fst">Classical Marxism contained little from which the Bolsheviks 
could have sought practical guidance. True, Engels had written passages with 
which no libertarian could quarrel.<a href="#n52" name="fn52" target="_self">[52]</a> 
But there were other passages, more doctrinaire in nature.<a href="#n53" name="fn53" target="_self">[53]</a> 
Moreover, Engels's historical analyses had constantly emphasized the social 
background against which the sexual revolution was to take place but had rarely 
dealt with the content of the process. As for Marx he had certainly stigmatized 
bourgeois marriage and the bourgeois family. He had mercilessly flayed the whole 
hypocrisy of bourgeois morality. But he had also denounced the "movement 
counterposing universal private property to private property", a movement which 
"finds expression in the bestial form of counterposing to marriage (certainly a 
form of exclusive private property) the community of women, in which a woman 
becomes a piece of communal and common property ..." If such a movement 
triumphed, the woman would pass "from marriage to general prostitution ... from 
the relationship of exclusive marriage with the owner of private property to a 
state of universal prostitution with the community".<a href="#n54" name="fn54" target="_self">[54]</a> 
The terms are emotionally loaded and the antithesis suggested is a false one. 
(Marx still formulates the alternative to individual property in terms of 
property - and not in terms of the free self-determination of both men and 
women. It is in much the same vein that Engels still speaks of "surrender").</p>

<p class="fst">However ambiguous or indistinct the "guidelines" may have been in 
1917 the problems requiring solution were real and practical enough. The 
cultural heritage of Tsarism had to be uprooted. This was an enormous task. 
Tsarist laws had certainly "protected" the family. They decreed that the husband 
"had to love his wife like his own body". The wife "owed unlimited obedience to 
the husband". Men could call on the police to compel women to return to the 
happy home. Parents could have their children of either sex confined to prison 
"for wilfully disobeying parental power". Young people contracting marriage 
without parental consent were also liable to imprisonment. Only religious 
marriages were deemed legal. Divorces, which only the Church could grant, were 
costly and only available to the rich.</p>

<p class="fst">All this reactionary legislation was swept aside by the new 
marriage decrees of December 19 and 20, 1917. These proclaimed the total 
equality of the contracting parties, an end to the legal incapacity of women, 
and the end of "indissoluble" marriage through the ready availability of 
divorce. The husband was deprived of his prerogative of domination over the 
family. Women were given the right freely to determine their name, domicile and 
citizenship. Any man over the age of eighteen (and any woman over the age of 
sixteen) could contract a marriage. As far as the offspring were concerned, no 
difference was recognized between "natural parentage" and "legal parentage".</p>

<p class="fst">Divorce was made very easy. The only criterion was mutual 
agreement between the parties. When a partner wanted to relinquish a sexual 
companionship he did not have to "give reasons". Marriage and divorce became 
purely private matters. The registration of a relationship was not mandatory. 
Even when a relationship was registered sexual relationships with others were 
not "prosecuted". (Not telling the partner about another relationship was, 
however, considered "fraud".) The obligation to pay alimony persisted for six 
months only after a separation, and only came into force if the partner was 
unemployed or otherwise incapable of earning a living. A law of 1919 legalized 
abortion during the first three months of pregnancy. All the old legislation 
directed against homosexuality amongst adults was repealed. Aspirations in this 
whole area of personal freedom are summarized by the jurist Hoichbarg, who wrote 
in the <i>Preface to the Bolshevik Marriage Code of 1919</i> that "the 
institution of marriage carried within itself the seeds of its own destruction" 
and that "the family still persisted only because we are dealing with socialism 
in a nascent state".</p>

<p class="fst">The newly proclaimed laws were radical indeed. Writing in 
<i>Pravda</i> on September 15, 1919, Lenin could truthfully state that "in the 
Soviet Republic not a stone remains of the laws that confined women to an 
inferior status". Particularly degrading had been the laws "which had deprived 
her of her rights and which have often humiliated her - that is to say the laws 
on divorce, the laws distinguishing natural from legitimate children, the laws 
demanding the determination of fatherhood before the upkeep of the child could 
be considered". Lenin also seems to have been aware of the fact that "laws were 
not enough" and that "even when a full equality of rights has been achieved the 
oppression of women would continue". But he saw this persisting oppression 
solely in terms of the domestic chores which for a while would still be her lot:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In most cases such chores were the least productive, the most 
barbarous and the heaviest to fall on women's shoulders. For women to be totally 
free and the real equal of man household chores must be made a public 
responsibility and the women must participate in general production."<a href="#n55" name="fn55" target="_self">[55]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Communal kitchens, creches and kindergartens - combined with 
access to all kinds of labour - were seen as the essential ingredients of 
woman's emancipation.</p>

<p class="fst">"The abolition of private property on the land and in the 
factories <i>alone</i> opens the road", wrote Lenin, "to the total and 
[actual] emancipation of women". Along this road there would be a "transition from the 
small individual household to the big socialist household".<a href="#n56" name="fn56" target="_self">[56]</a> 
This vision was undoubtedly shared by most of the leading Bolsheviks, who saw 
"women's liberation" as the summated freedoms from economic exploitation and 
from domestic slavery. The repressive mechanisms whereby female subjugation had 
become internalized in the minds of millions of women were not even suspected.</p>

<p class="fst">The new laws, it is true, provided a framework within which 
future attempts might be made, free from external constraints, at constructing 
human relationships of a new type. It is also true that the Bolsheviks wished to 
break patriarchal power. But they were only dimly aware of the role of the 
patriarchal family as the "structure-forming cell of class society"<a href="#n57" name="fn57" target="_self">[57]</a> 
- as "the structural and ideological place of reproduction of every social order 
based on authoritarian principles".<a href="#n58" name="fn58" target="_self">[58]</a> 
Still less did they realize the role of sexual repression in perpetuating such 
important aspects of the dominant ideology as the compliance with authority and 
the fear of freedom. Had they been more conscious of these facts many practical 
problems would have been differently managed, many fruitless discussions 
by-passed, many retrogressive statements or acts avoided. The revolutionaries 
would have shown less tolerance with the spokesmen of the old ideology and 
morality, many of whom had been left in high positions, from where they were 
inflicting untold damage upon the developing cultural revolution. The Bolsheviks 
repeatedly stressed that the new laws were "only the beginning". But a beginning 
of what? Wilhelm Reich points out that in the heated discussions of that period 
the conservatives seemed always to have the edge in all the arguments and the 
most ready access to all the "proofs". The revolutionaries "were prepared 
neither theoretically nor practically for the difficulties which the cultural 
revolution brought with it.<a href="#n59" name="fn59" target="_self">[59]</a> 
They knew little about the psychic structure of the generation they were seeking 
to win over from ideological allegiance to the Tsarist patriarchate. They were 
certainly trying to do something new, but they</p>

<p class="quoteb">"felt very clearly that they were not able to put the 'new' 
thing into words. They fought valiantly, but finally tired and failed in the 
discussion, partly because they themselves were caught in old concepts, from 
which they were unable to shake loose."<a href="#n60" name="fn60" target="_self">[60]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Revolution encountered tremendous problems. The compulsive 
family had only been legally abolished. The attitudes on which it was based 
persisted. Economic difficulties persisted too. And "as long as society could 
not guarantee security to all adults and adolescents this guarantee remained the 
function of the family".<a href="#n61" name="fn61" target="_self">[61]</a> The 
family therefore continued to exist. Its demands conflicted more and more with 
the new social obligations and aspirations of the group. The "life-affirmative 
sexual relationships in the collectives" struggled against the old family ties 
which "pervaded every corner of everyday life and the psychic structure".<a href="#n62" name="fn62" target="_self">[62]</a> 
For instance:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"parents, proletarians included, did not like to see their 
adolescent daughters go to meetings. They feared that the girls would 'go wrong' 
- that is start a sexual life. Though the children ought to go to the 
collective, the parents still made their old possessive demands on them. They 
were horrified when the children began to look at them with a critical eye."<a href="#n63" name="fn63" target="_self">[63]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Even in the most radical circles girls could still be denounced 
as "promiscuous", thereby revealing the deep-seated residual moral condemnation 
of female sexuality underlying all the "revolutionary" rhetoric.</p>

<p class="fst">The economic whip hand of the patriarchal father over wife and 
children was certainly loosened. But the increased opportunities for sexual 
happiness did not as yet mean the psychic capacity to enjoy such happiness. The 
internalized constraints had barely been dented. Everything was still distorted 
by the legacy of the past. "Infantile attitudes and pathological sexual habits" 
persisted. Family members would drown out unconscious antagonisms to one another 
with a forced affection and sticky dependence. "One of the main difficulties was 
the inability of the women - genitally crippled and unprepared for economic 
independence as they were - to give up their slave-like protection of the 
family"<a href="#n64" name="fn64" target="_self">[64]</a> and the substitute 
gratification which they derived from their domination over the children. Those 
whose whole lives were sexually empty and economically dependent had made of the 
upbringing of children the be-all and end-all of their existence. It was 
difficult to combat these possessive tendencies and this misuse of power on the 
part of the mothers without real insight to their origin. The mothers fought 
bitterly against any restriction of these powers.</p>

<p class="fst">Everyday life proved much more conservative than economy mainly 
because it was a much less conscious process. The revolutionaries were not 
equipped either ideologically or in terms of their own upbringing to intervene 
effectively in the heated discussions that raged up and down the country on the 
"sexual question". There was no theory of the sexual revolution. Trotsky's 
pamphlet <i>Problems of Life</i>,<a href="#n65" name="fn65" target="_self">[65]</a> 
written in 1923, does not even mention the sexual question. Many Bolshevik 
leaders took refuge in the formula that "sexuality was a private matter". This 
was unfortunate and "essentially an expression of the inability of the members 
of the Communist Party to manage the revolution in their own personal lives".<a href="#n66" name="fn66" target="_self">[66]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There was undoubtedly considerable malaise, at least to begin 
with. Many young people felt that these were important questions which should be 
honestly and openly talked about. Kollontai gives some idea of what was being 
discussed.<a href="#n67" name="fn67" target="_self">[67]</a> A functionary, 
Koltsov, points out that the key questions</p>

<p class="quoteb">"are never discussed. It is as if for some reason they were 
being avoided. I myself have never given them serious thought. They are new to 
me."</p>

<p class="fst">Another, Finkovsky, pinpoints the reasons for this avoidance:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The subject is rarely talked about because it hits home too 
closely with everybody ... The Communists usually point to the golden future and 
thus avoid getting into acute problems ... the workers know that in Communist 
families things are even worse than in their own."</p>

<p class="fst">Yet another official, Tseitlin, stressed that these were "exactly 
the questions which interest the workers, male and female alike". When such 
questions were the topic of Party meetings people would hear about it and flock 
to attend them. "They keep asking these questions and find no answers". Reich 
points out that ordinary people, without sexological training or knowledge, were 
describing exactly what is contended by sex-economy, namely that "the interest 
of the mass-individual is not political but sexual".<a href="#n68" name="fn68" target="_self">[68]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Answers were in fact being provided. They were inadequate, 
incomplete, and sometimes positively harmful. Sex "education" was slipping into 
the hands of public hygienists, biologists, urologists and professors of 
philosophy, ethics and sociology. The repercussions soon began to be felt - the 
cultural revolution began to wither at the roots. The "heated discussions" 
eventually died down. The impetus provided by the new legislation petered out - 
clearly revealing the obvious fact that a sexual revolution could not, like an 
economic revolution, be expressed through plans and laws. To be successful it 
had to manifest itself in all the details of everyday personal life. But here it 
encountered major obstacles. The revolution in the ideological superstructure 
had not yet taken place. The "bearer of this revolution, the psychic structure 
of human beings," was not yet changed.<a href="#n69" name="fn69" target="_self">[69]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Apart from the internalized inhibitions of the mass individual - 
a legacy of the past - change was also being inhibited from without (i.e., as a 
result of the internalized inhibitions of those now in authority). Lenin 
denounced the youth movement as being "exaggeratedly interested in sex".<a href="#n70" name="fn70" target="_self">[70]</a> 
The youth had been "attacked by the disease of modernity in its attitude towards 
sexual questions". All this was "particularly harmful, particularly dangerous". 
The new "flourishing sexual theories" arose out of the personal need of people 
"to justify personal abnormality in sexual life before bourgeois morality". They 
were being peddled by "little yellow-beaked birds who had just broken from the 
egg of bourgeois ideas". Psychoanalysis was to be mistrusted for it "grew on the 
dirty soil of bourgeois society". All that was relevant in this new concern with 
sexual matters "the workers had already read in Bebel, long ago". The new sexual 
life young people were trying to create was "an extension of bourgeois 
brothels". Within a short while every timid official, every repressed 
reactionary was to be found echoing Lenin's famous phrase: "Thirst must be 
satisfied - but will the normal man in normal circumstances lie down in the 
gutter and drink out of a puddle, or out of a glass with a rim greasy from many 
lips?"<a href="#n71" name="fn71" target="_self">[71]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The more farsighted among the revolutionaries sensed the 
backsliding, but their prescription was an intensification of the calls for 
industrialization. The lack of purely economic prerequisites for radical social 
change was stressed again and again. But as Reich points out:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the attitude, 'first the economic questions, <i>then</i> those 
of everyday life' was wrong and only the expression of the unpreparedness for 
the seemingly chaotic forms of the cultural revolution ... true, a society which 
is exhausted by civil war, which is unable immediately to establish public 
kitchens, laundries and kindergartens must first of all think of the economic 
prerequisites ... But it was not just a matter of lifting the masses to the 
level of the capitalist countries ... It was also necessary to be clear as to 
the nature of the new culture ... the cultural revolution posed infinitely more 
difficult problems than the political revolution. This is easy to understand. 
The political revolution requires essentially nothing but a strong trained 
leadership and the confidence of the masses in it. The cultural revolution, 
however, requires an alteration in the psychic structure of the mass individual. 
About this there was hardly any scientific, let alone practical, concept at that 
time."<a href="#n72" name="fn72" target="_self">[72]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It might perhaps be added that the dissemination of what little 
knowledge there was, instead of being actively encouraged, was being actively 
opposed by most of the Russian leaders. Attempts at establishing various kinds 
of "counter-milieu" - such as youth communes - were now also being actively 
discouraged by the authorities.</p>

<p class="fst">It was naive indeed to expect "progressive" legislation plus new 
property relations to solve these fundamental problems. The change in property 
relations may have prepared the ground for a new society but men alone were 
going to build it. For such a task a different kind of vision was necessary and 
it was precisely such a vision that was lacking.</p>

<p class="fst">Too many factors were combining to prevent the formal, legal 
changes that had been proclaimed from really influencing the course of events. 
As Reich was later to point out "an ideology or programme can only become a 
revolutionary power of historical dimensions if it achieves a deep-reaching 
change in the emotions and instinctual life of the masses". It influenced the 
development of society either "by passively tolerating despotism and 
suppression" or "by adjustment to the technical process of development 
instituted by the powers that be", or finally "by actively taking part in social 
development, as for example in a revolution". No concept of historical 
development could be called revolutionary "if it considers the psychic structure 
of the masses as nothing but the result of economic processes and not <i>also</i> 
as their motive power".<a href="#n73" name="fn73" target="_self">[73]</a> In the 
Russian Revolution the psychic structure of the masses never became - and was 
never allowed to become - a "revolutionary power of historical dimensions".</p>

<p class="fst">Between 1920 and about 1933 the situation gradually regressed to 
the point where the sexual ideology of the leading groups in the USSR could no 
longer be distinguished from that of the leading groups in any conservative 
country. Summing up the whole process Reich wrote that the leaders of the new 
Russian state could not be blamed for not knowing the solution to these 
problems,</p>

<p class="quoteb">"but they must be blamed for avoiding the difficulties, for 
taking the line of least resistance, for not asking themselves what it all 
meant, for talking about the revolution of life without looking for it in real 
life itself, for misinterpreting the existing chaos as a 'moral chaos' (using 
the terms in the same sense as the political reaction) instead of comprehending 
it as chaotic conditions which were inherent in the transition to new forms, and 
last but not least for repudiating the contributions to an understanding of the 
problem which the German sex-political movement had to offer."<a href="#n74" name="fn74" target="_self">[74]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In March 1934 the law punishing homosexuality was reintroduced 
into the Soviet Union. In June 1935 an editorial in <i>Pravda</i> wrote that 
"only a good family man could be a good Soviet citizen". By early 1936 a Russian 
trade union paper (<i>Trud</i>, April 27, 1936) could write:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"abortion, which destroys life, is inadmissible in any 
country. Soviet woman has the same rights as Soviet man, but that does not 
absolve her from the great and honourable duty [<i>sic</i>!] imposed on her by 
nature: she is to be a mother. She is to bear life.<a href="#n75" name="fn75" target="_self">[75]</a> 
And this is certainly not a private matter, but a matter of great social 
significance."<a href="#n76" name="fn76" target="_self">[76]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A decree of June 27, 1936, was to prohibit abortion. A further 
decree of July 8, 1944, established that "only a legally recognized marriage 
entails rights and duties for both husband and wife". In other words 
"illegitimate" children - or the offspring of non-registered relationships - 
reverted to their earlier inferior status. Unmarried couples living together 
were urged to "regularize" their relationship. Divorce would only be allowed "in 
important cases" and after "full consideration of all the relevant facts by a 
special tribunal". The cult of motherhood was given official blessing. An 
official Stalinist publication<a href="#n77" name="fn77" target="_self">[77]</a> 
could boast that "on June 1, 1949, in Soviet Russia, there were over two million 
mothers with families of five or six children who hold the 'maternity medal'; 
700,000 with families of seven, eight or nine children holding the 'Glory to 
Motherhood' medal; and 30,000 mothers of ten or more children entitled to the 
medal of 'Heroine Mother' ". (Enough to warm the heart of the most reactionary 
of Popes!) The author proclaims that "Soviet legislation on the question of the 
family has always been inspired by Marxism-Leninism", and that "its evolution, 
over a thirty-year period, had always had as its constant concern the wish to 
defend woman and to free her. This preoccupation had led the Soviet legislator 
from free divorce to regulated divorce and from legal abortion to the 
prohibition of abortion"!</p>

<p class="fst">From the middle thirties on, various critics of the bureaucracy 
became increasingly vocal. Trotsky's book <i>The Revolution Betrayed</i>, first 
published in 1936, contains an interesting chapter on "Family, Youth and 
Culture". In it Trotsky stigmatized those who proclaimed that woman had to 
accept "the joys of motherhood". This was "the philosophy of the priest endowed 
also with the powers of a gendarme". Trotsky correctly points out that the " 
'problem of problems' had not been solved: the forty million Soviet families 
remained in their overwhelming majority nests of medievalism, female slavery and 
hysteria, daily humiliation of children, feminine and childish superstition".</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The most compelling motive of the present cult of the family 
[was] undoubtedly the need of the bureaucracy for a stable hierarchy of 
relations and for the disciplining of youth by means of forty million points of 
support for authority and power."</p>

<p class="fst">The description is excellent. What is lacking is any real 
understanding of how it all came about. Economic and cultural backwardness are 
still seen as the sole ingredients of the failure. A whole dimension is missing. 
The role of Bolshevik obscurantism in relation to sex is not even suspected. One 
would search in vain among Trotsky's voluminous writings for any criticism, 
however muted, of what Lenin had said on the subject.</p>

<p class="fst">In the last twenty years - despite a steady "development of the 
productive forces" - the sexual counter-revolution has gained even further 
momentum. The distance travelled is perhaps best epitomized in a book by T.S. 
Atarov, "Physician Emeritus of the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic". The book, 
published in Moscow in 1959, is called <i>Problems of Sexual Education</i>,<a href="#n78" name="fn78" target="_self">[78]</a> 
and reveals the full extent of the sexual Thermidor. The author proclaims that 
"Soviet marriage is not only a private matter. It is a question involving 
society and the State". Young people are denounced who have pre-marital 
intercourse "without even experiencing guilt". "Unadapted elements" in Russian 
society are denounced, who had even sought to give "philosophical expression" to 
their attitude - in other words who had sought to argue a coherent case against 
the sexually repressive ideology of the Party leaders. Atarov bemoans the fact 
that young people "don't seem to realize the difference between puberty and 
sexual maturity" and that they seem to believe "that the mere existence of 
sexual desire is a justification for its satisfaction". But there were also 
encouraging signs. "Under Soviet conditions masturbation is no longer the mass 
phenomenon it was in the past". But "unfortunately" it still persisted. According 
to Atarov, various factors tended to perpetuate this alarming state of affairs, 
factors such as "tight fitting clothing in the nether parts, the bad habits of 
boys who keep their hands in their pockets or under their blankets or who lie on 
their stomachs, constipation and full bladders, the reading of erotic books and 
the contemplation of the sexual activities of animals".</p>

<p class="fst">How was one to fight this menace to the stability of Russian 
society? Yes! How did you guess? "Regular meals, hard beds, exercise, walking, 
sport and gymnastics, in fact anything that deflect the child's attention from 
sexual preoccupations".<a href="#n79" name="fn79" target="_self">[79]</a> 
Discussing menstruation, Atarov is even more with it! "Under no circumstances 
should any cotton or gauze appliance be inserted into the vagina as so many 
women do". The "outer parts" should be washed twice a day with warm boiled 
water. Our political spinster advises that "young people should be forbidden 
from serving in cafes, restaurants or bars for the atmosphere in these places 
encourages them to indulge in pre-marital relations". "No illness", he stresses, 
"was ever caused through abstinence, which is quite harmless for young and less 
young alike". In a frightening phrase Atarov sums up the spirit of his book. 
"The law cannot concern itself with every case of immoral conduct. The pressure 
of public concern must continue to play the leading role against all forms of 
immorality". The vice squad and public opinion were again to be the pillars of 
the sexual Establishment.</p>

<p class="fst">Readers will grasp the deeply reactionary significance of 
Atarov's pronouncements, particularly when endorsed by the full might of the 
Russian Educational Establishment (over 100,000 copies of Atarov's book were 
sold within a few days of the publication of the first edition). The "public 
opinion" which Atarov refers to is the one which had sought emancipation for a 
short while in 1917, but had soon been dragged back into the old rut of bigotry 
and repression. It could now be used again for censorious ends - as it had been 
for generations in the past.</p>

<p class="fst">Official Russian sexual morality - as seen through other official 
works - today resembles the kind of "advice to parents" dished out about 1890 by 
the bourgeois do-gooders of that time.<a href="#n80" name="fn80" target="_self">[80]</a> 
One finds in it all the fetishes of bourgeois sexual morality - or more 
generally of all systems of morality characterizing class societies of 
patriarchal type. Everything is there: all the reactionary anti-life ideas 
pompously disguised as "science", every backward prejudice, all the hypocritical 
bad faith of screwed-up and repressed puritans. But these "irrational" ideas not 
only have definite social roots (which we have sought to expose). They also have 
a precise significance and a specific function. In this they closely resemble 
the repressive morality which still prevails (although on a diminishing scale) 
in some Church-dominated Western countries.</p>

<p class="fst">Both East and West these ideologies aim at denying to individuals 
the autonomous (i.e., the conscious and self-managing) exercise of their own 
activities. They aim at depriving people of freedom and responsibility in a 
fundamental realm and at obliging them to conform to externally imposed norms 
and to the pressures of "public opinion" rather than to criteria determined by 
each person according to his own needs and experience. The objective of these 
repressive and alienating moralities is the mass creation of individuals whose 
character structure complements and reinforces the hierarchical structure of 
society. Such individuals will revert to infantile attitudes when confronted 
with those who symbolize authority, with those who incarnate - at the scale of 
society - the image of their parents (i.e., rulers of the state, managers of 
industry, priests, political pundits, etc.). In the Russian context they will 
comply with the edicts of the Central Committee, obediently follow the zigzags 
of the Party line, develop religious attitudes to the Holy Writings, etc. Such 
individuals will also react in an anxiety-laden manner when confronted with 
deviants of all kinds (perceptive writers, poets, cosmopolitans, the apostles of 
"modernity", those with long hair and those with long ideas). Is it really 
surprising that the most sexually repressed segment of the Russian population 
(obese, middle-aged women) still seem to be the main vehicle for the 
dissemination of "public opinion" and of the prevailing <i>kulturnost</i><a href="#n81" name="fn81" target="_self">[81]</a> 
despite the creches, despite the kitchens, despite the kindergartens - and 
despite the nationalization, nearly two generations ago, of the vast majority of 
the means of production?</p>

<h2><a name="h11">Appendix: Clara Zetkin, Reminiscences of Lenin</a></h2>

<p class="fst"><b>Lenin seldom talked about sex. Stripped of their 
"revolutionary" rhetoric, his occasional pronouncements on the subject were 
those of a puritan bigot.</b></p>

<p class="fst"><b>Because of Lenin's eminence and authority in other fields his 
views on sex exerted considerable influence. They were seized upon and repeated 
ad nauseam by all those opposed to any radical change in the field of sex 
relations. In this sense they played a significant role in the sexual 
counter-revolution which we have sought to outline in the previous essay.</b></p>

<p class="fst"><b>We here publish an excerpt from the chapter "Women, Marriage 
and Sex" of Clara Zetkin's book Reminiscences of Lenin (New York: International 
Publishers, 1934). This book was written in 1924, shortly after Lenin's death. 
Zetkin, a founding member of the German Communist Party, is speaking to Lenin in 
the Kremlin, in the summer of 1920.</b></p>

<p class="fst">Lenin continued: "Your list of sins, Clara, is still longer. I 
was told that questions of sex and marriage are the main subjects dealt with in 
the reading and discussion evenings of women comrades. They are the chief 
subject of interest, of political instruction and education. I could scarcely 
believe my ears when I heard it. The first country of proletarian dictatorship 
surrounded by the counter-revolutionaries of the whole world, the situation in 
Germany itself requires the greatest possible concentration of all proletarian, 
revolutionary forces to defeat the ever-growing and ever-increasing 
counter-revolution. But working women comrades discuss sexual problems and the 
question of forms of marriage in the past, present and future. They think it 
their most important duty to enlighten proletarian women on these subjects. The 
most widely read brochure is, I believe, the pamphlet of a young Viennese woman 
comrade on the sexual problem. What a waste! What truth there is in it the 
workers have already read in Bebel, long ago. Only not so boringly, not so 
heavily written as in the pamphlet, but written strongly, bitterly, 
aggressively, against bourgeois society.</p>

<p class="fst">"The extension of Freudian hypotheses seems 'educated', even 
scientific, but it is ignorant bungling. Freudian theory is the modern fashion. 
I mistrust the sexual theories of the articles, dissertations, pamphlets, etc., 
in short, of that particular kind of literature which flourishes luxuriantly in 
the dirty soil of bourgeois society. I mistrust those who are always 
contemplating the several questions, like the Indian saint his navel. It seems 
to me that these flourishing sexual theories which are mainly hypothetical, and 
often quite arbitrary hypotheses, arise from the personal need to justify 
personal abnormality or hypertrophy in sexual life before bourgeois morality, 
and to entreat its patience. This masked respect for bourgeois morality seems to 
me just as repulsive as poking about in sexual matters. However wild and 
revolutionary the behaviour may be, it is still really quite bourgeois. It is, 
mainly, a hobby of the intellectuals and of the sections nearest them. There is 
no place for it in the Party, in the class conscious, fighting proletariat".</p>

<p class="fst">I interrupted here, saying that the questions of sex and 
marriage, in a bourgeois society of private property, involve many problems, 
conflicts and much suffering for women of all social classes and ranks. The war 
and its consequences had greatly accentuated the conflicts and sufferings of 
women in sexual matters, had brought to light problems which were formerly 
hidden from them. To that were added the effects of the revolution. The old 
world of feeling and thought had begun to totter. Old social ties are entangling 
and breaking, there are tendencies towards new ideological relationships between 
man and woman. The interest shown in these questions is an expression of the 
need for enlightenment and reorientation. It also indicates a reaction against 
the falseness and hypocrisy of bourgeois society. Forms of marriage and of the 
family, in their historical development and dependence upon economic life, are 
calculated to destroy the superstition existing in the minds of working women 
concerning the external character of bourgeois society. A critical, historical 
attitude to those problems must lead to a ruthless examination of bourgeois 
society, to a disclosure of its real nature and effects, including condemnation 
of its sexual morality and falseness. All roads lead to Rome. And every real 
Marxist analysis of any important section of the ideological superstructure of 
society, of a predominating social phenomenon, must lead to an analysis of 
bourgeois society and of its property basis, must lead to the realization, "this 
must be destroyed".</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin nodded laughingly: "There we have it! You are defending 
counsel for your women comrades and your Party. Of course what you say is right. 
But it only excuses the mistakes made in Germany; it does not justify them. They 
are, and remain, mistakes. Can you really seriously assure me that the questions 
of sex and marriage were discussed from the standpoint of a mature, living, 
historical materialism? Deep and many-sided knowledge is necessary for that, the 
clearest Marxist mastery of a great amount of material. Where can you get the 
forces for that now? If they existed, then pamphlets like the one I mentioned 
would not be used as material for study in the reading and discussion circles. 
They are distributed and recommended, instead of being criticized. And what is 
the result of this futile, un-Marxist dealing with the question? That questions 
of sex and marriage are understood not as part of the large social question? No, 
worse! The great social question appears as an adjunct, a part, of sexual 
problems. The main thing becomes a subsidiary matter. That does not only 
endanger clarity on that question itself, it muddles the thoughts, the class 
consciousness of proletarian women generally.</p>

<p class="fst">"Last and not least. Even the wise Solomon said that everything 
has its time. I ask you: Is now the time to amuse proletarian women with 
discussions on how one loves and is loved, how one marries and is married? ... 
Now all the thoughts of women comrades, of the women of the working people, must 
be directed towards the proletarian revolution. It creates the basis for a real 
renovation in marriage and sexual relations. At the moment other problems are 
more urgent than the marriage forms of Maoris or incest in olden times. The 
question of Soviets is still on the agenda for the German proletariat. The 
Versailles Treaty and its effect on the life of the working woman - 
unemployment, falling wages, taxes, and a great deal more. In short, I maintain 
that this kind of political, social education for proletarian women is false, 
quite, quite false. How could you be silent about it? You must use your 
authority against it.</p>

<p class="fst">I have not failed to criticize and remonstrate with leading women 
comrades in the separate districts, I told my angry friend. He himself knew that 
a prophet is never recognized in his own country or family. By my criticism I 
had laid myself open to the charge of "strong survivals of social-democratic 
ideology and old-fashioned Philistinism". But at last my criticism had begun to 
take effect. Questions of sex and marriage were no longer the central feature of 
discussion. But Lenin continued the thread of thought further.</p>

<p class="fst">"I know, I know", he said. "I have also been accused by many 
people of Philistinism in this matter, although that is repulsive to me. There 
is much hypocrisy and narrow-mindedness in it. Well, I'm bearing it calmly! The 
little yellow-beaked birds who have just broken from the egg of bourgeois ideas 
are always frightfully clever. We shall have to let that go. The youth movement 
too is attacked with the disease of modernity in its attitude towards sexual 
questions and in being exaggeratedly concerned with them". Lenin gave an ironic 
emphasis to the word modernity and grimaced as he did so. "I have been told that 
sexual questions are the favourite study of your youth organizations, too. There 
is supposed to be a lack of sufficient orators on the subject. Such 
misconceptions are particularly harmful, particularly dangerous in the youth 
movement. They can very easily contribute towards over-excitement and 
exaggeration in the sexual life of some of them, to a waste of youthful health 
and strength. You must fight against that, too. There are not a few points of 
contact between the women's and youth movements. Our women comrades must work 
together systematically with the youth. That is a continuation, an extension and 
exaltation of motherliness from the individual to the social sphere. And all the 
awakening social life and activity of women must be encouraged, so that they can 
discard the limitations of their Philistine individualist home and family 
psychology. But we'll come to that later.</p>

<p class="fst">"With us, too, a large part of the youth is keen on 'revising 
bourgeois conceptions and morality' concerning sexual questions. And, I must 
add, a large part of our best, our most promising young people. What you said 
before is true. In the conditions created by the war and the revolution the old 
ideological values disappeared or lost their binding force. The new values are 
crystallizing slowly, in struggle. In the relations between man and man, between 
man and woman, feelings and thoughts are becoming revolutionized. New boundaries 
are being set up between the rights of the individual and the rights of the 
whole in the duties of individuals. The matter is still in a completely chaotic 
ferment. The direction, the forces of development in the various contradictory 
tendencies are not yet clearly defined. It is a slow and often a very painful 
process of decay and growth. And particularly in the sphere of sexual 
relationships, of marriage and the family. The decay, the corruption, the filth 
of bourgeois marriage, with its difficult divorce, its freedom for the man, its 
enslavement for the woman, the repulsive hypocrisy of sexual morality and 
relations fill the most active minded and best people with deep disgust ... </p>

<p class="fst">"The changed attitude of the young people to questions of sexual 
life is of course based on a 'principle' and a theory. Many of them call their 
attitude 'revolutionary' and 'Communistic'. And they honestly believe that it is 
so. That does not impress us old people. Although I am nothing but a gloomy 
ascetic, the so-called 'new sexual life' of the youth - and sometimes of the old 
- often seems to me to be purely bourgeois, an extension of bourgeois brothels. 
That has nothing whatever in common with freedom of love as we Communists 
understand it. You must be aware of the famous theory that in Communist society 
the satisfaction of sexual desires, of love, will be as simple and unimportant 
as drinking a glass of water. This glass of water theory has made our young 
people mad, quite mad. It has proved fatal to many young boys and girls. Its 
adherents claim that it is Marxist. But thanks for such Marxism which directly 
and immediately attributes all phenomena and changes in the ideological 
superstructure of society to its economic basis! Matters aren't quite as simple 
as that. A certain Frederick Engels pointed that out a long time ago with regard 
to historical materialism.</p>

<p class="fst">"I think this glass of water theory is completely un-Marxist, and 
moreover, antisocial ... Of course, thirst must be satisfied. But will the 
normal man in normal circumstances lie down in the gutter and drink out of a 
puddle, or out of a glass with a rim greasy from many lips? But the social 
aspect is most important of all. Drinking water is of course an individual 
affair. But in love two lives are concerned, and a third, a new life, arises. It 
is that which gives it its social interest, which gives rise to a duty towards 
the community.</p>

<p class="fst">"As a Communist I have not the least sympathy for the glass of 
water theory, although it bears the fine title 'satisfaction of love'. In any 
case, this liberation of love is neither new nor Communist. You will remember 
that about the middle of the last century it was preached as the 'emancipation 
of the heart' in romantic literature. In bourgeois practice it became the 
emancipation of the flesh. At that time the preaching was more talented than it 
is today, and as for the practice, I cannot judge. I don't mean to preach 
asceticism by my criticism. Not in the least. Communism will not bring 
asceticism, but joy of life, power of life, and a satisfied love life will help 
to do that. But in my opinion the present widespread hypertrophy in sexual 
matters does not give joy and force to life, but takes it away. In the age of 
revolution that is bad, very bad.</p>

<p class="fst">"Young people, particularly, need the joy and force of life. 
Healthy sport, swimming, racing, walking, bodily exercises of every kind, and 
many-sided intellectual interests. Learning, studying, inquiry, as far as 
possible in common. That will give young people more than eternal theories and 
discussions about sexual problems and the so-called 'living to the full'. 
Healthy bodies, healthy minds! Neither monk nor Don Juan, nor the intermediate 
attitude of the German Philistines. You know young comrade --? A splendid boy, 
and highly talented. And yet I fear that nothing good will come out of him. He 
reels and staggers from one love affair to the next. That won't do for the 
political struggle, for the revolution. And I wouldn't bet on the reliability, 
the endurance in struggle of those women who confuse their personal romances 
with politics. Nor of the men who run after every petticoat and get entrapped by 
every young woman. No, no! that does not square with the revolution". Lenin 
sprang up, banged his hand on the table, and paced the room for a while.</p>

<p class="fst">"The revolution demands concentration, increase of forces. From 
the masses, from individuals. It cannot tolerate orgiastic conditions, such as 
are normal for the decadent heroes and heroines of D'Annunzio. Dissoluteness in 
sexual life is bourgeois, is a phenomenon of decay. The proletariat is a rising 
class. It doesn't need intoxication as a narcotic or a stimulus. Intoxication as 
little by sexual exaggeration as by alcohol. It must not and shall not forget, 
forget the shame, the filth, the savagery of capitalism. It receives the 
strongest [urge] to fight from a class situation, from the Communist ideal. It needs 
clarity, clarity, and again clarity. And so I repeat, no weakening, no waste, no 
destruction of forces. Self-control, self-discipline is not slavery, not even in 
love. But forgive me, Clara, I have wandered far from the starting-point of our 
conversation. Why didn't you call me to order? My tongue has run away with me. I 
am deeply concerned about the future of our youth. It is a part of the 
revolution. And if harmful tendencies are appearing, creeping over from 
bourgeois society into the world of revolution - as the roots of many weeds 
spread - it is better to combat them early. Such questions are part of the women 
question".</p>

<h2><a name="h12">Introduction to the 1975 edition</a></h2>

<p class="fst">We first published this text in June 1970. A great deal has 
happened since then. The works of Wilhelm Reich have become available in many 
cheap editions and his ideas are widely known among revolutionaries.<a href="#n82" name="fn82" target="_self">[82]</a> 
The rise of the Women's Liberation Movement has ensured that many of the notions 
rather tentatively put forward in this pamphlet are now widely accepted. The 
debate about "sexual liberation" and about "sexual politics" in general has in 
fact gone a lot further than was envisaged in these pages.</p>

<p class="fst">What is striking, however, is the disparity between radical 
attitudes in this area (now shared by many) and the continued acceptance by most 
so-called revolutionaries (Stalinists, Trotskyists, Maoists, etc.) of 
authoritarian practices and institutions. Whether we like it or not these groups 
and the ideas they peddle still dominate the political scene. We hope our 
pamphlet may contribute to subverting their orthodoxies and incidentally help 
some of them come to libertarian politics.</p>

<p class="fst">The author has two main criticisms of the original text. The 
first is that it was insufficiently critical of Reich's concept of the 
centrality of sexual repression in the genesis of authoritarian conditioning. 
Reich undoubtedly achieved many valid insights in this field, but other factors 
are also clearly involved and an overwhelmingly unidimensional approach (such as 
Reich's) in the long run creates more problems (both practical and theoretical) 
than it solves.</p>

<p class="fst">Secondly, the original text, while correctly stressing the social 
dimension of the problem of sexual liberation, was probably too optimistic in 
its hopes that it would prove easy for individuals to break with a process of 
conditioning as old as class society itself, and to live as rational, 
emancipated human beings, free of sexual inhibitions, yet considerate of the 
feelings of others.<a href="#n83" name="fn83" target="_self">[83]</a></p>

<p class="fst">These two considerations do not detract, however, from the 
relevance of this area. They should, on the contrary, be seen as a spur to 
further investigation into the roots of human belief and behaviour. If socialism 
is, in the phrase of the young Marx, "man's positive self-consciousness", then 
all endeavours to deepen our understanding of <i>how</i> people think, and 
<i>why</i> they think and feel certain things, seem both worthwhile and necessary.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n5" href="#fn5">[5]</a> To accept this as an

Wilhelm Reich</i> (Lausanne: La Cité, 1969)). It is essential reading for anyone 
seriously concerned at understanding the tragic life of this remarkable man. The 
author of this pamphlet has borrowed deeply from this source.</p>

will describe how the "soil" is rendered "fertile" for the acceptance of such 
ideas. At this stage we would only like to point out that other sections of the 
population are also affected. Ruling classes, for instance, are often mystified 
by their own ideology. But politically this is a phenomenon of lesser 
significance (ruling elites in fact benefit by the maintenance of ideological 
mystification and of irrational social systems which proclaim the "need" for 
such elites!).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n21" href="#fn21">[21]</a> This factual approach is 
a relatively recent development. As Kinsey, Pomeroy and Martin point out in 
their famous study on the <i>Sexual Behaviour of the Human Male</i> 
(Philadelphia: Saunders, 1948), pp. 21-22: "From the dawn of human history, from 
the drawings left by primitive peoples, on through the developments of all 
civilizations (ancient, classic, oriental, medieval and modern), men have 
recorded their sexual activities and their thinking about sex. The printed 
literature is enormous and the other material is inexhaustible ... [This 
literature] is at once an interesting reflection on man's absorbing interest in 
sex and his astounding ignorance of it; his desire to know and his unwillingness 
to face the facts; his respect for an objective scientific approach to the 
problems involved and his overwhelming urge to be poetic, pornographic, 
literary, philosophical, traditional and moral, in short, to do anything except 
ascertain the basic facts about himself.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n22" href="#fn22">[22]</a> According to the Freudian 
model, the personality consists of the id, the ego and the superego. The first 
and last are unconscious. The id is the sum total of the instinctual drives of 
the individual. The superego is a kind of internal policeman, originating in the 
constraints exercised on the individual "on behalf of society" by parents and 
other educators. The ego is man's conscious self.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n24" href="#fn24">[24]</a> In 1927 Freud himself 
warned Reich, his former pupil, that in attacking the family he was "walking 
into a hornet's nest". In August 1934, Reich was to be expelled from the German 
Association of Psychoanalysts.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n25" href="#fn25">[25]</a> Reich was expelled from 
the German Communist Party in 1933. In December 1932 the Party had forbidden the 
circulation of his works in the Communist Youth Movement, among whom they had 
evoked a considerable echo. Marxist and psychoanalyst, Reich saw his work 
condemned by those who claimed to be the standard bearers of Marxism and 
psychoanalysis. A little later, the Nazis were also to forbid the circulation of 
his works in Germany.</p>

understanding was to lead to his open hostility to the sexual revolution which 
swept Russia in the wake of the Civil War and to contribute yet another element

<p class="endnote"><a name="n38" href="#fn38">[38]</a> There has probably never 
been a truly "matriarchal" society in the sense of a mirror image of patriarchal 
society. The notion of such a society where wives hold the purse strings, order 
their husbands about, beat them up from time to time and take all the important 
decisions concerning both individuals and the tribe as a whole is at best a 
retrospective projection or nightmare of guilt-laden males.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n39" href="#fn39">[39]</a> It is interesting that 
the best known modern matrilinear societies (the Nayars of Kerala and the 
Menangkabau Malays) far from being "primitive" are advanced, literate and 
cultured people, who have produced an extensive literature. The Khasi of Assam 
are less advanced but are far from being savages. As Radcliffe-Brown and Forde 
point out (<i>African Systems of Kinship and Marriage</i>): "the typical 
instances of mother-right are found not amongst the most primitive people but in 
advanced or relatively advanced societies".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n40" href="#fn40">[40]</a> In this they resemble 
many of the "alternatives" propounded today by many so-called revolutionaries 
(for instance "monogamous marriage" or "communes" for life "after the 
Revolution").</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n44" href="#fn44">[44]</a> In the last years of his 
life Reich developed paranoid symptoms and quarrelled with nearly all his 
erstwhile supporters. He was driven mad, at least in part, by the apparently 
insoluble contradiction "no social revolution without sexual revolution - no 
sexual revolution without social revolution". Use Ollendorf Reich, <i>Wilhelm 
Reich</i>, <i>op. cit.</i>, gives a fairly objective account of the last phase 
of the life of this remarkable man.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n45" href="#fn45">[45]</a> As St. Just once 
emphasized, "those who will only carry out half a revolution dig their own 
graves".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n46" href="#fn46">[46]</a> Early in 1927, in the 
little Austrian town of Schattendorf, some members of the Heimwehr (a 
paramilitary, right-wing formation, part of which later defected to the Nazis) 
had opened fire from a barricaded inn on a peaceful procession of Socialist 
workers, killing two and wounding many. On July 14 the assassins were acquitted 
by a judge faithful to the Old Regime. The following day there was a mass strike 
and street demonstrations in Vienna, in the course of which the crowd set fire 
to the Palace of "Justice". The police opened fire at short range. 85 civilians, 
all workers, were killed, some of them by police whom they were actually trying 
to rescue from the burning building. Most of the dead were buried in a mass 
"Grave of Honour" provided by the Vienna Council, then under Socialist control. 
The events proved a turning-point in Austrian history. For further details see 
<i>Fallen Bastions</i>, by G. E. R. Geyde.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n47" href="#fn47">[47]</a> Reich, <i>The Mass 
Psychology of Fascism</i>, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 212.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n48" href="#fn48">[48]</a> This is absolutely 
correct. It is often the most oppressed economically and the most culturally 
deprived who will argue most strenuously about the need for leaders and 
hierarchy and about the impossibility of equality or workers' management, all of 
which are vehemently described as contrary to "human nature" (MB).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n49" href="#fn49">[49]</a> See Paul Cardan, 
<i>Modern Capitalism and Revolution</i> (in particular Chapter 9, "Capitalist 
Ideology Yesterday and Today").</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n50" href="#fn50">[50]</a> In Catholic or Muslim 
countries, sexual repression remains a pillar of the social order, but even the 
Catholic Church is having trouble (both with its clergy and with its youth). 
Among the Palestinian guerillas women are fighting alongside men. This fight 
cannot be waged wearing a yashmak or accepting traditional Arab values as to the 
role and function of women in society.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n52" href="#fn52">[52]</a> "What we can conjecture 
at present about the regulation of sex relationships after the impending 
effacement of capitalist production is, in the main, of a negative character, 
limited mostly to what will vanish. But what will be added? That will be settled 
after the new generation has grown up: a generation of men who will never in all 
their lives have had occasion to purchase a woman's surrender either with money 
or with any other means of social power, and of women who have never been 
obliged to surrender to any man out of any other consideration other than that 
of real love, or to refrain from giving themselves to their beloved for fear of 
the economic consequences. Once such people appear, they won't care a rap about 
what we today think they should do. They will establish their own practice and 
their own public opinion ... and that's the end of it!" (Engels, <i>The Origin 
of the Family, Private Property and the State</i>, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 137-8).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n53" href="#fn53">[53]</a> Describing for instance 
the effects of the Industrial Revolution which uprooted women from the home and 
drove them into factories, Engels says (in <i>The Condition of the Working Class 
in England in 1844</i>) that at times women even became the breadwinners while 
the husbands stayed at home as housekeepers. According to Engels this was "an 
insane state of things" which "unsexes the man and takes from the woman all 
womanliness". The notion that woman's place is in the home has some strange 
advocates!</p>

authenticity of Clara Zetkin's account has never been questioned. Her 
<i>Reminiscences of Lenin</i> have been produced many times by official Communist 
publishing houses, both in Russia and elsewhere.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n71" href="#fn71">[71]</a> Lenin's metaphors 
concerning "the gutter" and "puddles" are revealing on two grounds. Implicit in 
them are (a) the conception that sex is intrinsically dirty, and (b) the 
conception that sex is a relation with an object - water - rather than a 
relationship with another human being. The second point, it is true, is 
mitigated by Lenin's later statement that "two lives are concerned ..." But the 
overall image was to be remembered long after the qualifying statement had been 
forgotten.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n75" href="#fn75">[75]</a> The myth that 
childbearing and rearing are the fulfilment of a woman's destiny is among the 
most pernicious and damaging myths that imprison her. It has harmful effects on 
the children themselves. The situation is well described in the following 
passage taken from an article by Laurel Limpus, 
<i>Liberation of Women, Sexual Repression, and the Family</i> (recently reprinted 
by Agit Prop, London): "Having children is no substitute for creating one's own 
life, for producing. And since so many women in this culture devote themselves 
to nothing else, they end up by becoming intolerable burdens upon their children 
because in fact these children are their whole lives". Juliet Mitchell, 
<i>Women: The Longest Revolution</i>, has caught the situation exactly: "At 
present, reproduction in our society is often a kind of sad mimicry of 
reproduction. Work in a capitalist society is an alienation of labour in the 
making of a social product which is confiscated by capital. But it can still 
sometimes be a real act of creation, purposive and responsible, even in 
conditions of the worst exploitation. Maternity is often a caricature of this. 
The biological product - the child - is treated as if it were a solid product. 
Parenthood becomes a kind of substitute for work, an activity in which the child 
is seen as an object created by the mother, in the same way that a commodity is 
created by a worker. Naturally, the child does not literally escape, but the 
mother's alienation can be much worse than that of the worker whose product is 
appropriated by the boss. No human being can create another human being. A 
person's biological origin is an abstraction. The child as an autonomous person 
inevitably threatens the activity which claims to create it continually merely 
as a possession of the parent. Possessions are felt as extensions of the self. 
The child as a possession is supremely this. Anything the child does is 
therefore a threat to the mother herself who has renounced her autonomy through 
this misconception of her reproductive role. There are few more precarious 
ventures on which to base a life."</p>

<p class="endnote">"So we have the forty or fifty-year-old woman complaining to 
her grown child: "But I gave you everything". This is quite true: this is the 
tragedy. It is a gift the child hardly wanted, and indeed, many children are 
daily mutilated by it. And it leaves women at the waning of their years with the 
feeling that they have been deceived, that their children are ungrateful, that 
no one appreciates them because they have come to the realization that they have 
done nothing".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n76" href="#fn76">[76]</a> In his <i>Principles of 
Communism</i>, Engels had written that the socialist revolution "would transform 
the relations between the sexes into purely private relations, only concerning 
the people participating in them and in which society had not to intervene".</p>

Communisme</i> (Paris: Editions Sociales, 1951).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n78" href="#fn78">[78]</a> For a detailed review, 
see "Sexual Thermidor", <i>Solidarity</i>, IV, 8 (July 1967).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n79" href="#fn79">[79]</a> Lenin had also spoken 
(see Appendix) of "healthy sport, swimming, racing, walking, bodily exercises of 
every kind" as giving young people more than "eternal theories and discussions 
about sexual problems". "Healthy bodies, healthy minds", he said, echoing the 
words of Juvenal ("<i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>", <i>Satires</i>, 10, 356), 
the Stoic moralist and misogynist who had "exposed the vices" of ancient Rome.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n80" href="#fn80">[80]</a> Much contemporary 
sexological Russian literature reads like the works of Scout founder 
Baden-Powell, but with the word "socialism" occasionally scattered among the 
references to "duty", "loyalty", "discipline", "service", and "patriotism".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n81" href="#fn81">[81]</a> See "Letter from a Friend 
in Russia", <i>Solidarity</i>, VI, 3 (19 January 1970), for a description of 
these attempts to enforce this "behaviour expected of cultured people".</p>
