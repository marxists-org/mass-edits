<h2><a name="h1">Introduction</a></h2>

<p class="fst">This pamphlet has two aims. It seeks to contribute new factual 
material to the current discussion on "workers' control". And it attempts a new 
kind of analysis of the fate of the Russian Revolution. The two objectives, as 
will be shown, are inter-related.</p>

<p class="fst">"Workers' control" is again being talked about. Nationalization 
(whether of the Western or Eastern variety) and the rule of the "Party of the 
working class" (whether of the Eastern or Western variety) have manifestly 
failed. They have not satisfied the hopes and expectations of ordinary people - 
or given them any real say in determining the conditions under which they live. 
This has created new interest in the subject of "workers' control" and in ideas 
which, in a different context, were common currency at the beginning of the 
century.</p>

<p class="fst">Today people as different as Young Liberals and Labour "lefts", 
tired trade union officials and "Trotskyists" of one kind or another - not to 
mention anarcho-syndicalists and "libertarian Marxists" - all talk about 
"workers' control". This suggests one of two things. Either these people have 
common objectives - which seems unlikely - or the words serve to mask as much as 
they convey. We hope to dispel some of the confusion by recalling how, at a 
critical stage of history, the advocates of different conceptions of "workers' 
control" confronted one another and by showing who won, why they won, and what 
the consequences were to be.</p>

<p class="fst">This return to the historical roots of the controversy is not 
motivated by an addiction to archivism or by a partiality for the esoteric. The 
revolutionary movement in Britain - unlike that in several European countries - 
has never been much concerned with theory, preferring on the whole an empirical, 
"suck-it-and-see" kind of approach. This may at times have helped it avoid 
becoming bogged down in the swamps of metaphysical speculation but the overhead 
costs - in terms of clarity and consistency - have been heavy. Without a clear 
understanding of objectives and of the forces (including ideological forces) 
impeding advance - in short without a sense of history - the revolutionary 
struggle tends to become "all movement and no direction". Without clear 
perspectives, revolutionaries tend to fall into traps - or be diverted into 
blind alleys - which, with a little knowledge of their own past, they could 
easily have avoided.</p>

<p class="fst">The confusion about workers' control (at least in Britain) is 
partly terminological. In the British movement (and to a lesser extent in the 
English language) a clear-cut distinction is seldom made between "control" and 
"management", functions which may occasionally overlap but are usually quite 
distinct. In French, Spanish or Russian political literature two separate terms 
(<i>contrôle</i> and <i>gestion</i>, <i>control</i> and <i>gerencia</i>, <i>
kontrolia</i> and <i>upravleniye</i>) refer respectively to partial or total 
domination of the producers over the productive process. A moment's reflection 
will make it obvious why one must make this distinction.</p>

<p class="fst">Two possible situations come to mind. In one the working class 
(the collective producer) takes all the fundamental decisions. It does so 
directly, through organisms of its own choice with which it identifies itself 
completely or which it feels it can totally dominate (Factory Committees, 
Workers' Councils, etc.). These bodies, composed of elected and revocable 
delegates probably federate on a regional and national basis. They decide 
(allowing the maximum possible autonomy for local units) what to produce, how to 
produce it, at what cost to produce it, at whose cost to produce it. The other 
possible situation is one in which these fundamental decisions are taken 
"elsewhere", "from the outside", i.e. by the State, by the Party, or by some 
other organism without deep and direct roots in the productive process itself. 
The "separation of the producers from the means of production" (the basis of all 
class society) is maintained. The oppressive effects of this type of arrangement 
soon manifest themselves. This happens whatever the revolutionary good 
intentions of the agency in question, and whatever provisions it may (or may 
not) make for policy decisions to be submitted from time to time for 
ratification or amendment.</p>

<p class="fst">There are words to describe these two states of affairs. <i>To 
manage</i> is to initiate the decisions oneself, as a sovereign person or 
collectivity, in full knowledge of all the relevant facts. <i>To control</i> is 
to supervise, inspect or check decisions initiated by others. "Control" implies 
a limitation of sovereignty or, at best, a state of duality of power, wherein 
some people determine the objectives while others see that the appropriate means 
are used to achieve them. Historically, controversies about workers' control 
have tended to break out precisely in such conditions of economic dual power.</p>

<p class="fst">Like all forms of dual power, economic dual power is essentially 
unstable. It will evolve into a consolidation of bureaucratic power (with the 
working class exerting less and less of the control). Or it will evolve into <i>
workers' management</i>, with the working class taking over all managerial 
functions. Since 1961, when <i>Solidarity</i> started advocating "workers' 
management of production", others have begun to call for "workers' <i>direct</i> 
control", "workers' <i>full</i> control", etc. - so many tacit admissions of the 
inadequacy (or at least ambiguity) of previous formulations.</p>

<p class="fst">It would be a short-sighted view to see in all this a question of 
linguistic purism, a terminological or doctrinal quibble. We have to pay a 
ransom to both the past and the present. We have not appeared on the political 
scene from nowhere. We are part of a revolutionary libertarian tradition for 
whom these concepts had deep significance. And we are not living in a political 
vacuum. We are living in a specific historical context, in which a constant 
struggle is taking place. In this struggle the conflicting interests of 
different social strata (bourgeoisie, bureaucracy and proletariat) are expressed 
in different types of demands, more or less clearly formulated. Different ideas 
about control and management figure prominently in these controversies. Unlike 
Humpty Dumpty we cannot make words mean exactly what we choose.</p>

<p class="fst">The revolutionary movement itself moreover is one of the forces 
on this social arena. Whether we like it or not - and whether it fully 
appreciates it or not - most of the revolutionary movement is impregnated with 
the ethos, traditions and organizational conceptions of Bolshevism. And in the 
history of the Russian Revolution - particularly between 1917 and 1921 - the 
issue of "workers' control" versus "workers' management" loomed large. "From 
1917 to 1921 the issue of industrial administration was the most sensitive 
indicator of the clash of principles about the shaping of the new social 
order...It was the most continuous and provocative focus of actual conflict between 
the communist factions".<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> And, it 
should be stressed, between the Bolsheviks and other tendencies in the 
revolutionary movement. Thousands of revolutionaries were to be killed and 
hundreds of thousands incarcerated, fighting it out.</p>

<p class="fst">Most of those now entering the revolutionary movement will be 
unfamiliar with these controversies. A virtue should not however be made of this 
state of affairs. Clarification is essential, but here new problems arise. The 
methodological poverty, ahistoricism (at times even anti-intellectualism) among 
so many of those revolutionaries who <i>do</i> have some knowledge as to what 
actually happened is a first tragic obstacle. And it is one of the ironies of 
the present situation that those others (the residual legatees of Bolshevism) 
who talk loudest about the "need for theory" and the "need to study history" 
should be those with the most to hide (should their own historical antecedents 
really be unearthed) and with the most to lose (should a coherent alternative 
emerge to challenge their ossified beliefs).</p>

<p class="fst">Some of the confusion about "workers' control" is neither 
terminological nor due to ignorance concerning past controversies. It is 
deliberate. Today, for instance, one finds some hardened, old-time Leninists or 
Trotskyists (in the Socialist Labour League, International Marxist Group or in 
the "leadership" of International Socialism for instance) advocating "workers' 
control" without batting an eyelid. Seeking to capitalize on the confusion now 
rampant in the movement, these people talk of "workers' control" as if (a) they 
meant by these words what the politically unsophisticated might think they mean 
(i.e. that working people should themselves decide about the fundamental matters 
relating to production) and (b) as if they - and the Leninist doctrine to which 
they claim to adhere - had always supported demands of this kind, or as if 
Leninism had always seen in workers' control the universally valid foundation of 
a new social order, rather than just a <i>slogan</i> to be used for manipulatory 
purposes in specific and very limited historical contexts.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The question of self-management is not esoteric. Its discussion - 
in the sharpest possible terms - is not sectarian. Self-management is what the 
revolution of our time is all about. This in itself would justify a pamphlet 
such as the present one. A study of this period (Russia, 1917-1921) has, 
however, deeper implications. It could provide the basis for a new kind of 
analysis of the fate of the Russian Revolution, a task to which we will now 
briefly turn.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="h2">The Russian Revolution</a></h2>

<p class="fst">To propose a new way of looking at what happened in Russia in 
1917 (and after) is synonymous with an invitation to be misunderstood. If 
moreover the questions asked and the methodology suggested happen to differ from 
those in current use the proposal almost becomes a guarantee. As we have had 
occasion to mention before misrepresentation is a way of life on the traditional 
left, for whom nothing is quite as painful as a new idea.</p>

<p class="fst">Over the last fifty years all the existing organizations of the 
left have elaborated a whole mythology (and even a whole anti-mythology) about 
the Russian Revolution. The parliamentary fetishists of Social Democracy see 
"the failure of Bolshevism" in its "anti-democratic practices". The original 
sin, for them, was the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly. The self-styled 
"Communist" movement (Stalinists, Trotskyists, Maoists, etc.) talks with filial 
pride of the "glorious, socialist, October Revolution". They seek to vaunt and 
popularize its original achievements while differing in their appreciations of 
what happened subsequently, when it happened, why it happened and to whom it 
happened. For various anarchists the fact that the State or "political power" 
was not immediately "abolished" is the ultimate proof and yardstick that nothing 
of fundamental significance really occurred.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> 
The SPGB (Socialist Party of Great Britain) draw much the same conclusion, 
although they attribute it to the fact that the wages system was not abolished, 
the majority of the Russian population not having had the benefit of hearing the 
SPGB viewpoint (as put by spokesmen duly sanctioned by their Executive 
Committee) and not having then sought to win a Parliamentary majority in the 
existing Russian institutions.</p>

<p class="fst">On all sides people seek to use the Russian Revolution with a 
view to integrating it into their own propaganda - only retaining of it those 
aspects which happen to conform with their own particular analysis of history, 
or their own particular prescriptions for the present. Whatever was new, 
whatever seemed to contradict established theories or break out of established 
categories, has been systematically "forgotten", minimized, distorted, denied.</p>

<p class="fst">Any attempt to re-evaluate the crucial experience of 1917-1921 is 
bound to evoke opposition. The first to react will be the "apparatchiks" who for 
years have been protecting "revolutionary" organizations (and "revolutionary" 
ideology) from the dual threats of subversion and renewal. Opposition will also 
be found however in the minds of many honest militants, seeking the road to 
genuinely revolutionary politics. One isn't dealing here with a simple 
psychological resistance but with a much deeper phenomenon which cannot be 
explained away by reference to the reactionary role and influence of various 
"leaderships". If the average militant has difficulty in understanding the full 
significance of some of the problems raised in the early stages of the Russian 
Revolution, it is because these problems are amongst the most important and 
difficult (if not <i>the</i> most important and difficult) ever to have 
confronted the working class. The working class made a revolution that went 
beyond a mere change in the political personnel at the top. It was able to 
expropriate the former owners of the means of production (thereby profoundly 
altering the existing property relations). But to what extent was it able to go 
beyond even this? To what extent was it able - or prepared - to revolutionize 
the relations of production? Was it willing to destroy the authority structure 
which the relations of production embody and perpetuate in all class societies? 
To what extent was it prepared itself to manage production (and thereby the 
whole of society), or to what extent was it inclined to delegate this task to 
others? And to what extent was the dominant ideology to triumph, compelling the 
working class to substitute for its avowed enemies a Party that claimed to speak 
"on its behalf"?</p>

<p class="fst">To answer these questions is a major task beset with pitfalls. 
One of the dangers confronting anyone seeking dispassionately to analyze the 
"heroic period of the Russian Revolution" is the danger of "retrospective 
identification" with this or that tendency or individual then active on the 
political scene (Osinsky, Kollontai, Maximov, Makhno or Myasnikov, for 
instance). This is a pointless political pastime. It leads rapidly to a state of 
mind where instead of seeking to understand the broad course of events (which is 
a relevant preoccupation) revolutionaries find themselves asking such questions 
as "what should have been done at this or that moment?"; "was this or that 
action premature?"; "who was right at this or that Congress?"; etc. We hope to 
have avoided this snare. When, for instance, we study the struggle of the 
Workers' Opposition against the leadership of the Party (in 1920 and 1921) it is 
not for us a question of "taking sides". It is a question of <i>understanding</i> 
what the forces in conflict really represented. What, for instance, were the 
motives (and the ideological and other limitations) of those who appeared to be 
challenging the drift to bureaucratization in every aspect of social life?</p>

<p class="fst">Another danger (or another form of the same danger) threatens 
those venturing into this field for the first time, while still befuddled by the 
official mythology. It is the danger of becoming entangled in the very legend 
one is seeking to destroy. Those, for instance, seeking to "demolish" Stalin (or 
Trotsky, or Lenin) may successfully achieve their immediate objective. But they 
may "succeed" at the expense of not seeing, sensing or recording the most 
fundamental new features of this period: the autonomous action of the working 
class seeking totally to alter the conditions of its existence. We hope to have 
avoided this trap. If we have quoted at some length the statements of prominent 
individuals it is only insofar as they epitomize the ideologies which, at a 
given point in history, guided the actions and thoughts of men. Throughout the 
account, moreover, we have felt that the only way seriously to deal with what 
the Bolsheviks said or did was to explain the social role of their utterances 
and actions.</p>

<p class="fst">We must now state our own methodological premises. We hold that 
the "relations of production" - the relations which individuals or groups enter 
into with one another in the process of producing wealth - are the essential 
foundations of any society. A certain pattern of relations of production is the 
common denominator of all class societies. This pattern is one in which the 
producer does not dominate the means of production but on the contrary both is 
"separated from them" and from the products of his own labour. In all class 
societies the producer is in a position of subordination to those who manage the 
productive process. Workers' management of production - implying as it does the 
total domination of the producer over the productive process - is not for us a 
marginal matter. It is the core of our politics. It is the only means whereby 
authoritarian (order-giving, order-taking) relations in production can be 
transcended and a free, communist or anarchist, society introduced.</p>

<p class="fst">We also hold 
that the means of production may change hands (passing for instance from private 
hands into those of a bureaucracy, collectively owning them) <i>without this 
revolutionizing the relations of production</i>. Under such circumstances - and 
whatever the formal status of property - the society is still a class society 
for production is still managed by an agency other than the producers 
themselves. Property relations, in other words, do not necessarily reflect the 
relations of production. They may serve to mask them - and in fact they often 
have.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This much of the analysis is fairly widely accepted. What has not 
been hitherto attempted is to relate the history of the Russian Revolution to 
this overall conceptual framework. Here we can only indicate the broad lines of 
such an approach.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> Seen in this 
light the Russian Revolution represents an unsuccessful attempt by the Russian 
working class to break out of relations of production that were proving 
increasingly oppressive. The massive upsurge of 1917 proved strong enough to 
smash the political supremacy of the bourgeoisie (by shattering the economic 
base on which it was founded: the private ownership of the means of production). 
It altered the existing system of property relations. But it did not prove 
strong enough (despite heroic attempts in this direction) to alter the 
authoritarian relations of production characteristic of all class societies. 
Sections of the working class (those most active in the Factory Committee 
Movement) certainly attempted to influence the Revolution in this direction. But 
their attempt failed. It is worth analyzing the causes of this failure - and 
seeing how new masters came to replace the old ones.</p>

<p class="fst">What were the forces pitted against those seeking a total 
transformation of the conditions of industrial life? First, of course, there was 
the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie had <i>everything</i> to lose in such a total 
social upheaval. Confronted with workers' management, it stood to lose not only 
its <i>ownership</i> of the means of production but also the possibility of <i>
privileged positions</i> vested in expertise and in the exercise of decisional 
authority. No wonder the bourgeois breathed a sigh of relief when they saw that 
the leaders of the Revolution would "go no further than nationalization" and 
were keen to leave intact the order-giver/order-taker relationship in industry 
and elsewhere. True, large sections of the bourgeoisie fought desperately to 
regain their lost property. The Civil War was a protracted and bloody affair. 
But thousands of those who, through custom and culture, were more or less 
closely attached to the expropriated bourgeoisie were very soon offered the 
opportunity to re-enter the "revolutionary stronghold" - by the back door as it 
were - and to resume their role as managers of the labour process in the 
"Workers' State". They seized this unexpected opportunity eagerly. In droves 
they either joined the Party - or decided to co-operate with it, cynically 
welcoming every utterance by Lenin or Trotsky in favour of "labour discipline" 
or "one-man management". Many were soon to be appointed (from above) to leading 
positions in the economy. Merging with the new political-administrative "elite", 
of which the Party itself formed the nucleus, the more "enlightened" and 
technologically skilled sections of the "expropriated class" soon resumed 
dominant positions in the relations of production.</p>

<p class="fst">Secondly, the Factory Committee Movement had to cope with openly 
hostile tendencies on the "left", such as the Mensheviks. The Mensheviks 
repeatedly stressed that as the Revolution could only be of bourgeois-democratic 
type there could be no future in attempts by the workers to manage production. 
All such endeavours were denounced as "anarchist" and "utopian". In places the 
Mensheviks proved a serious obstacle to the Factory Committee Movement, but the 
opposition was anticipated, principled and consistent.</p>

<p class="fst">Thirdly - and far more difficult to see through - was the 
attitude of the Bolsheviks. Between March and October the Bolsheviks supported 
the growth of the Factory Committees, only to turn viciously against them in the 
last few weeks of 1917, seeking to incorporate them into the new union 
structure, the better to emasculate them. This process, which is fully described 
in the pamphlet, was to play an important role in preventing the rapidly growing 
challenge to capitalist relations of production from coming to a head. Instead 
the Bolsheviks canalized the energies released between March and October into a 
successful onslaught against the political power of the bourgeoisie (and against 
the property relations on which that power was based). At this level the 
Revolution was "successful". But the Bolsheviks were also "successful" in 
restoring "law and order" in industry - a law and order that reconsolidated the 
authoritarian relations in production, which for a brief period had been 
seriously shaken.</p>

<p class="fst">Why did the Party act in this manner? To answer this question 
would require a much fuller analysis of the Bolshevik Party and of its relation 
to the Russian working class than we can here attempt. Again one would have to 
steer clear both of mythology ("the great Bolshevik Party", "the weapon forged 
by Lenin", "the spearhead of the Revolution", etc.) and of anti-mythology ("the 
Party as the embodiment of totalitarianism, militarism, bureaucracy", etc.), 
seeking constantly to understand rather than to rant or rave. At the superficial 
level both the Party's ideology and its practice were firmly rooted in the 
specific historical circumstances of Tsarist Russia, in the first decade of this 
century. Illegality and persecution partly explain (although they do not 
justify) the Party's organizational structure and its conception of its 
relationship to the class.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> What 
is more difficult to understand is the naivety of the Bolshevik leaders who 
don't seem to have appreciated the effects that this type of organization and 
this type of relationship to the class would inevitably have on the subsequent 
history of the Party.</p>

<p class="fst">Writing of the early history of the Party no lesser an exponent 
of Bolshevik orthodoxy than Trotsky was to state:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The habits peculiar...to a political machine were already 
forming in the underground. The young revolutionary bureaucrat was already 
emerging as a type. The conditions of conspiracy, true enough, offered rather 
meagre scope for such formalities of democracy as elections, accountability and 
control. Yet undoubtedly the Committee men narrowed these limitations 
considerably more than necessity demanded. They were far more intransigent and 
severe with the revolutionary working men than with themselves, preferring to 
domineer even on occasions that called imperatively for lending an attentive ear 
to the voice of the masses. Krupskaya notes that, just as in the Bolshevik 
committees, so at the Congress itself, there were almost no working men. The 
intellectuals predominated. 'The Committee man', writes Krupskaya, 'was usually 
quite a self-confident person...as a rule he did not recognize any internal 
party democracy...did not want any innovations...did not desire and did not 
know how to adapt himself to rapidly changing conditions' ".<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">What all this was to lead to was first hinted at in 1905. Soviets 
had appeared in many places.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The Petersburgh Committee of the Bolsheviks was frightened at 
first by such an innovation as a non-partisan representation of the embattled 
masses. It could find nothing better to do than to present the Soviet with an 
ultimatum: immediately adopt a Social-Democratic programme or disband. The 
Petersburgh Soviet as a whole, including the contingent of Bolshevik working men 
as well, ignored this ultimatum without batting an eyelid".<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Broué, one of the more sophisticated apologists of Bolshevism, 
was to write that "those in the Bolshevik Party who were the most favourable to 
the Soviets only saw in them, in the best of cases, auxiliaries for the 
Party...only belatedly did the Party discover the role it could play in the Soviets, 
and the interest that the Soviets presented for increasing the Party's influence 
with a view to leading the masses".<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> 
The problem is put here in a nutshell. The Bolshevik cadres saw their role as 
the leadership of the revolution. Any movement not initiated by them or 
independent of their control could only evoke their suspicion.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> 
It has often been said that the Bolsheviks were "surprised" by the creation of 
the Soviets: this euphemism should not mislead us. The reaction of the 
Bolsheviks was of far deeper significance than mere "surprise" - it reflected a 
whole concept of revolutionary struggle, a whole concept of the relationship 
between workers and revolutionaries. The <i>action</i> of the Russian masses 
themselves, as far back as 1905, was already to condemn these attitudes as 
outdated.</p>

<p class="fst">This separation between the Bolsheviks and the masses was to be 
revealed repeatedly during 1917. It was first witnessed during the February 
Revolution, again at the time of the <i>April Theses</i>, and later still at the 
time of the July days.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> It has 
repeatedly been admitted that the Party made "mistakes" both in 1905 and in 
1917. But this "explanation" explains nothing. What one should be asking is what 
made these mistakes possible? And one can answer only if one understands the <i>
type of work</i> undertaken by the Party cadres, from the creation of the Party 
right up to the time of the Revolution. The Party leaders (from those on the 
Central Committee down to those in charge of local groups) had been placed, 
through the combined effects of the conditions of the struggle against Tsarism 
and of their own organizational conceptions, in a situation which allowed them 
only tenuous links with the real workers' movement. "A worker-agitator", wrote 
Lenin,</p>

<p class="quoteb">"who shows any talent and is at all promising <i>should not 
work in the factory</i>. We must see to it that he lives on Party 
support...and goes over to an underground status".<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">No wonder the few Bolshevik cadres of working-class origin soon 
lost real contacts with the class.</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolshevik Party was torn by a contradiction which helps 
explain its attitude before and after 1917. Its strength lay in the advanced 
workers who supported it. There is no doubt that this support was at times 
widespread and genuine. But these workers could not control the Party. The 
leadership was firmly in the hands of professional revolutionaries. In a sense 
this was inevitable. A clandestine press and the dissemination of propaganda 
could only be kept going regularly by militants constantly on the move and at 
times compelled to seek refuge overseas. A worker could only become a Bolshevik 
cadre on condition he ceased work and placed himself at the disposal of the 
Party, which would then send him on special missions, to this or that town. The 
apparatus of the Party was in the hands of revolutionary specialists. The 
contradiction was that the real living forces that provided the strength of the 
Party could not control it. As an institution, the Party totally eluded control 
by the Russian working class. The problems encountered by the Russian Revolution 
after 1917 did not bring about this contradiction, they only served to 
exacerbate it. The attitude of the Party in 1917 and after are products of its 
history. This is what rendered so futile most of the attempts made within the 
Party by various oppositions between 1918 and 1921. They failed to perceive that 
a given ideological premise (the preordained hegemony of the Party) led 
necessarily to certain conclusions in practice.</p>

<p class="fst">But even this is probably not taking the analysis far enough. At 
an even deeper level the very conception of this kind of organization and this 
kind of relationship to the mass movement reflect the unrecognized influence of 
bourgeois ideology, even on the minds of those who were relentlessly seeking to 
overthrow bourgeois society. The concept that society must necessarily be 
divided into "leaders" and "led", the notion that there are some born to rule 
while others cannot really develop beyond a certain stage have from time 
immemorial been the tacit assumptions of every ruling class in history. For even 
the Bolsheviks to accept them shows how correct Marx was when he proclaimed that 
"the ruling ideas of each epoch are the ideas of its ruling class". Confronted 
with an "efficient", tightly-knit organization of this kind, built on ideas of 
this kind, it is scarcely surprising that the emerging Factory Committees were 
unable to carry the Revolution to completion.</p>

<p class="fst">The final difficulty confronting the Committees was inherent in 
the Committee Movement itself. Although certain individuals showed extraordinary 
lucidity, and although the Committee Movement represents the highest 
manifestation of the class struggle achieved in 1917, the movement as a whole 
was unable to understand what was happening to it and to offer any serious 
resistance. It did not succeed in generalizing its experience and the record it 
left is, unfortunately, very fragmentary. Unable to proclaim its own objectives 
(workers' self-management) in clear and positive terms, it was inevitable that 
others would step into the vacuum. With the bourgeoisie in full disintegration, 
and the working class as yet insufficiently strong or conscious to impose <i>its 
own</i> solutions to the problems tearing society apart, the triumphs of 
Bolshevism and of the bureaucracy were both inevitable.</p>

<p class="fst">An analysis of the Russian Revolution shows that in allowing a 
specific group, separate from the workers themselves, to take over the function 
of managing production, the working class loses all possibility of even 
controlling the means of producing wealth. The separation of productive labour 
from the means of production results in an exploiting society. Moreover, when 
institutions such as the Soviets could no longer be influenced by ordinary 
workers, the regime could no longer be called a soviet regime. By no stretch of 
the imagination could it still be taken to reflect the interests of the working 
class. <i>The basic question</i>: <i>who manages production after the overthrow 
of the bourgeoisie? should therefore now become the centre of any serious 
discussion about socialism</i>. Today the old equation (liquidation of the 
bourgeoisie = workers' state) popularized by countless Leninists, Stalinists and 
Trotskyists is just not good enough.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1917 the Russian workers created organs (Factory Committees 
and Soviets) that might have ensured the management of society by the workers 
themselves. But the Soviets passed into the hands of Bolshevik functionaries. A 
state apparatus, separate from the masses, was rapidly reconstituted. The 
Russian workers did not succeed in creating new institutions through which they 
would have managed both industry and social life. This task was therefore taken 
over by someone else, by a group whose specific task it became. The bureaucracy 
organized the work process in a country of whose political institutions it was 
also master.</p>

<p class="fst">All this necessitates a serious re-evaluation of several basic 
concepts. "Workers' power" cannot be identified or equated with the power of the 
Party - as it repeatedly was by the Bolsheviks. In the words of Rosa Luxemburg, 
workers' power must be implemented</p>

<p class="quoteb">"by the class, not by a minority, managing things in the name 
of the class. It must emanate from the active involvement of the masses, remain 
under their direct influence, be submitted to control by the entire population, 
result from the increasing political awareness of the people".</p>

<p class="fst">As for the concept of "taking power" it cannot mean a 
semi-military putsch, carried out by a minority, as it obviously does for so 
many who still seem to be living in the Petrograd of 1917. Nor can it only mean 
the defence - however necessary - of what the working class has won against 
attempts by the bourgeoisie to win it back. What "taking power" really implies 
is that the vast majority of the working class at last realizes its ability to 
manage both production and society - and organizes to this end.</p>

<p class="fst">This text is in no sense an economic history of Russia between 
1917 and 1921. It is, at best, a selective industrial chronology. In most 
instances the facts speak for themselves. In a few places, we have taken the 
opportunity of describing our own views, particularly when we felt that all the 
protagonists in the great historical debates were wrong, or trapped in a system 
of ideas that prevented them from appreciating the real significance of what was 
happening. Events such as the stages of the Civil War are only mentioned in 
order to place various controversies in context - and to nail once and for all 
the allegation that many of the measures described were taken "as a result of 
the Civil War".</p>

<p class="fst">It will probably be objected that, throughout the narrative, 
greater stress has been placed on various struggles within the Party than on the 
actions of the millions who, for one reason or another, never joined the Party 
or who, from the beginning, saw through what it was endeavouring to do. The 
"charge" is true but the shortcoming almost unavoidable. The aspirations of 
thousands of people, their doubts, their hesitations, their hopes, their 
sacrifices, their desire to transform the conditions of their daily life and 
their struggles to do so are undoubtedly as much a moulding force of history as 
the resolutions of Party Congresses or the speeches of Party leaders. Yet an 
activity that has neither rules nor statutes, neither tribunes nor troubadours, 
belongs almost by definition to what history suppresses. An awareness of the 
problem, however acute, will not generate the missing material. And an essay 
such as this is largely a question of documentation. The masses make history, 
they do not write it. And those who do write it are nearly always more concerned 
with ancestor worship and retrospective justification that with a balanced 
presentation of the facts.</p>

<p class="fst">Other charges will also be made. The quotations from 
Lenin and Trotsky will not be denied but it will be stated that they are 
"selective" and that "other things, too" were said. Again, we plead "guilty". 
But we would stress that there are hagiographers enough in the trade whose 
"objectivity" (like Deutscher's for instance) is but a cloak for sophisticated 
apologetics. There is moreover another reason for unearthing this material. 
Fifty years after the Revolution - and long after its "isolation" has been 
broken - the bureaucratic system in Russia clearly bears little resemblance to 
the model of the Paris Commune (elected and revocable delegates, none receiving 
more than a working man's wage, etc., etc.). In fact Russia's social structure 
has scarcely any anticipation in the whole corpus of Marxist theory. It 
therefore seems more relevant to quote those statements of the Bolshevik leaders 
of 1917 which helped determine Russia's evolution rather than those other 
statements which, like the May Day speeches of Labour leaders, were forever to 
remain in the realm of rhetoric.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n2" href="#fn2">[2]</a> Not all Trotskyist 
tendencies practice this kind of deception. Some are unambiguously reactionary. 
For instance K. Coates and A. Topham state "it seems sensible for us to speak of 
'workers' control' to indicate the aggressive encroachment of Trade Unions [<i>sic</i>!] 
on management powers, in a capitalist framework, and of 'workers' 
self-management' to indicate attempts to administer a socialized economy 
democratically" (<i>Industrial Democracy in Great Britain</i> (London: MacGibbon 
&amp; Kee, 1968, p. 363). Trotsky himself was just as straightforward. Although not 
making of workers' control a function to be exercised by the unions he 
distinguished clearly enough between "control" and "management". "For us the 
slogan of control is tied up with the period of dual power in production which 
corresponds to the transition from the bourgeois regime to the 
proletarian...In the language of all mankind by control is understood surveillance and 
checking by one institution over the work of another. Control may be very 
active, authoritative and all embracing. But it still remains control. The very 
idea of this slogan is an outgrowth of the transitional regime in industry, when 
the capitalist and his administrators can no longer take a step without the 
consent of the workers, but on the other hand, when the workers have not as 
yet...acquired the technique of management, nor yet created the organs essential 
for this" (L. Trotsky, <i>What Next? Vital Questions for the German Proletariat</i>, 
1932).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> An example of such an over 
simplified analysis of the fate of the revolution can be found in Voline, <i>
Nineteen-Seventeen</i> (London: Freedom Press, 1954). "The Bolshevik Party, once 
in control, installed itself as absolute master. It was quickly corrupted. It 
organized itself as a privileged caste. And later it flattened and subjected the 
working class in order to exploit it, under new forms, in its own interests".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n4" href="#fn4">[4]</a> For a full discussion of 
this concept - and of all its implications - see P. Chaulieu, "Les rapports de 
production en Russie", <i>
Socialisme ou Barbarie</i>, no. 2 (May-June 1949). Although the concept may 
surprise many "Marxists" it is of interest that Engels had clearly perceived it. 
In his letter to Schmidt (October 27, 1890) he wrote: "In a modern state, law 
must not only correspond to the general economic condition and be its 
expression, but must also be an <i>internally coherent</i> expression which does 
not, owing to inner contradictions, reduce itself to nought. And in order to 
achieve this, the faithful reflection of economic conditions suffers 
increasingly...The reflection of economic relations as legal principles is 
necessarily...a topsy-turvy one..." (Marx-Engels, <i>Selected Correspondence</i> 
(Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, n.d.) pp. 504-5).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n5" href="#fn5">[5]</a> That such an analysis might 
be possible was suggested in an excellent short pamphlet: J. Barrot, <i>Notes 
pour une analyse de la Révolution Russe</i> (Paris: Librairie "La Vieille

<p class="endnote"><a name="n10" href="#fn10">[10]</a> The same attitude was to 
be found within the Party itself. As Trotsky himself was to say, this time 
approvingly: "The statutes should express the leadership's organized distrust of 
the members, a distrust manifesting itself in vigilant control from above over 
the Party" (I. Deutscher, <i>The Prophet Armed</i> (Oxford University Press, 
1954), p. 76.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n11" href="#fn11">[11]</a> No, we are not saying 
that the military overthrow of the Provisional Government was possible in July. 
We are merely stressing how out of touch the Party was with what the masses 
really wanted.</p>
