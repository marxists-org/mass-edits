<h2><a name="h1">1920</a></h2>

<h4><a name="h2">January</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Collapse of Whites in Siberia. Blockade lifted by Great Britain, 
France and Italy.</p>

<p class="fst">Decree issued by Sovnarkom laid down general regulations for 
universal labour service "to supply industry, agriculture, transport and other 
branches of the national economy with labour power on the basis of a general 
economic plan". Anyone could be called up on a single occasion or periodically 
for various forms of work (agriculture, building, road-making, food or fuel 
supplies, snow clearance, carting and "measures to deal with the consequences of 
public calamities"). In an amazing aside the document stated that there was even 
cause to "regret the destruction of the old police apparatus which had known how 
to register citizens, not only in towns but also in the country".<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h3">January 12</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Meeting of All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions.</b></p>

<p class="fst">At the gathering of the Bolshevik fraction Lenin and Trotsky 
together urge acceptance of the militarization of labour. Only two of sixty or 
more Bolshevik trade-union leaders support them. "Never before had Trotsky or 
Lenin met with so striking a rebuff".<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h4">January 10-21</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Third Congress of Economic Councils.</b></p>

<p class="fst">In a speech to the Congress Lenin declares:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the collegial principle 
[collective management]...represents something rudimentary, necessary for the first stage, when it is 
necessary to build anew...The transition to practical work is connected with 
individual authority. This is the system which more than any other assures the 
best utilization of human resources."<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Despite this exhortation, opposition to Lenin and Trotsky's views 
was steadily gaining ground. The Congress adopted a resolution <i>in favour</i> 
of collective management of production.</p>

<h4><a name="h5">February</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Regional Party Conferences in Moscow and Kharkov come out against 
"one-man management". So did the Bolshevik faction of the All-Russian Central 
Council of Trade Unions (ARCCTU) at its meetings in January and March.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> Tomsky, a well-known trade-union leader and a member of the ARCCTU presented 
"Theses" ("On the Tasks of the Trade Unions") which were accepted despite their 
implicit criticism of Lenin's and Trotsky's views.</p>

<p class="fst">Tomsky's theses claimed that</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the fundamental principle guiding the work of various bodies 
leading and administering the economy remains the principle now in existence: 
collective management. This must be applied from the Presidium of the Vesenka 
right down to the management of the factories. Collective management alone can 
guarantee the participation of the broad non-Party masses, through the medium of 
the unions."</p>

<p class="fst">The matter was still seen however as one of expediency rather 
than basic principle. "The trade unions", Tomsky claimed, "are the most 
competent and interested organizations in the matter of restoring the country's 
production and its correct functioning".<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The adoption of Tomsky's theses by a substantial majority marked 
the high-point of opposition, within the Party, to Lenin's views. Resolutions 
however were unlikely to resolve the differences. Both sides realized this. A 
more serious threat to the Party leadership came from the efforts of Party 
dissidents in industry to establish an independent centre, from which to control 
the Party organizations in the trade unions. Friction had developed between the 
Party and trade union authorities over assignments of Party members to trade 
union work. The Party fraction in the All-Russian Central Council of Trade 
Unions, dominated by "lefts"</p>

<p class="quoteb">"was claiming direct authority over the Party members in the 
various industrial unions. Shortly before the Ninth Congress the Party fraction 
in the ARCCTU passed a resolution which would confirm this claim, by making all 
Party fractions in the unions directly subordinate to the Party fraction in the 
ARCCTU, rather than to the geographical organizations of the Party. This 
literally would have created a Party within the Party, a semi-autonomous body 
embracing a substantial proportion of the Party's membership...The mere 
existence of such an inner sub-party would be contrary to centralist principles, 
to say nothing of the prospect of its domination by leftist opponents of Lenin's 
leadership...It was inevitable that the unionists' demand for autonomy within 
the Party would be rejected and when the resolution was submitted to the 
Orgbureau this is precisely what happened".<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The whole episode had interesting repercussions. Confronted with 
a conflict between democracy and centralism, the "democratic centralists" proved 
that on this issue - as on so many others - centralist considerations were 
paramount. They proposed a resolution, passed by the Moscow organization of the 
Party, to the effect that "Party discipline in every case takes precedence over 
trade union discipline".<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> On 
the other hand the Southern Bureau of the ARCCTU passed a resolution on autonomy 
for Party trade unionists similar to that drawn up by the parent organization - <i>
and got it passed by the Fourth Ukrainian Party Conference</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="h6">March</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Second All-Russian Congress of Food Industry Workers</b> 
(under syndicalist influence) meets in Moscow. Censures Bolshevik regime for 
inaugurating "unlimited and uncontrolled dominion over the proletariat and 
peasantry, frightful centralism carried to the point of absurdity...destroying 
in the country all that is alive, spontaneous and free". "The so-called 
dictatorship of the proletariat is in reality the dictatorship over the 
proletariat by the Party and even by individual persons".<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h7">March 29-April 4</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Ninth Party Congress.</b></p>

<p class="fst">The Civil War had by now almost been won. The people were 
yearning to taste, at last, the fruits of their revolution. But the Congress 
foreshadowed the continuation and extension into peacetime of some of the 
methods of War Communism (conscription of manpower, compulsory direction of 
labour, strict rationing of consumer goods, payment of wages in kind, 
requisition of agricultural produce from the peasants - in the place of 
taxation). The most controversial issues discussed were the "militarization of 
labour" and "one-man management" of industry. The proposals put to the Congress 
may be taken as representing the views of Lenin and Trotsky concerning the 
period of industrial reconstruction.</p>

<p class="fst">On the question of direction of labour, Trotsky's views were 
heavily influenced by his experiences as Commissar for War. Battalions awaiting 
demobilization had been used on a wide scale for forestry and other work. 
According to Deutscher "it was only a step from the employment of armed forces 
as labour battalions to the organization of civilian labour into military 
units".<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> "The working 
class", Trotsky announced to the Congress:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"cannot be left wandering all over Russia. They must be thrown 
here and there, appointed, commanded, just like soldiers.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Compulsion of labour will reach the highest degree of 
intensity during the transition from capitalism to socialism.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Deserters from labour ought to be formed into punitive 
battalions or put into concentration camps."</p>

<p class="fst">He advocated "incentive wages for efficient workers", "socialist 
emulation" and spoke of the "need to adopt the progressive essence of 
Taylorism".<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> In relation to 
industrial management Lenin and Trotsky's main preoccupations were with 
"economic efficiency". Like the bourgeoisie (both before and after them) they 
identified "efficiency" with individual management. They realized however that 
this would be a bitter pill for the workers to swallow. They had to tread 
carefully.</p>

<p class="fst">"Individual management", the official resolution delicately 
proclaimed,</p>

<p class="quoteb">"does not in any degree limit or infringe upon the rights of 
the working class or the 'rights' of the trade unions, because the class can 
exercise its rule in one form or another, as technical expediency may dictate. 
It is the ruling class at large [again identified with the Party (MB)] which in 
every case 'appoints' persons for managerial and administrative jobs."<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Their caution was justified. The workers had not forgotten how at 
the First Trade Union Congress (January 1918) a resolution had proclaimed that 
"it was the task of workers' control to put an end to autocracy in the economic 
field just as an end had been put to it in the political field".<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Various patterns of industrial management were soon outlined.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> 
In drawing these up it is doubtful whether Lenin and Trotsky were encumbered by 
any doctrinal considerations such as those of Kritzman, the theoretician of 
"left" Communism, who had defined collective management as "the specific, 
distinctive mark of the proletariat...distinguishing it from all other social 
classes...the most democratic principle of organization".<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> 
Insofar as he had any principled view on the matter Trotsky was to declare that 
collective management was a "Menshevik idea".</p>

<p class="fst">At the Ninth Congress Lenin and Trotsky were opposed most 
vehemently by the Democratic Centralists (Osinsky, Sapronov, Preobrazhensky). 
Smirnov, obviously ahead of his time, enquired why if one-man management was 
such a good idea it wasn't being practised in the Sovnarkom (Council of People's 
Commissars). Lutovinov, the metalworkers' leader, who was to play an important 
role in the development of the Workers' Opposition later that year, asserted 
that</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the responsible head of each branch of industry can only be 
the production union. And of industry as a whole it can only be the All-Russian 
Central Council of Trade Unions - it cannot be otherwise".<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Shlyapnikov called explicitly for a three-way "separation of 
powers" between Party, Soviets and the trade unions.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> 
Speaking for the Democratic Centralists, Osinsky endorsed Shlyapnikov's idea. He 
observed a "clash of several cultures" (the "military-soviet" culture, the 
"civil-soviet" culture and the trade-union movement which had "created its own 
sphere of culture"). It was improper to apply to all of the cultures certain 
particular methods (such as militarization) which were appropriate to only one 
of them.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> This was a clear 
case of being caught in a trap of one's own making.</p>

<p class="fst">On the question of "one-man management" the Democratic 
Centralists also had a position which was beside the real point. A resolution, 
which they had voted through the earlier Moscow Provincial Party Conference, 
minimized the matter:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The question of the collegial system [collective management] 
and individual authority is not a question of principle, but a practical one. It 
must be decided in each case according to the circumstances".<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">While correctly grasping that collective management had <i>of 
itself</i> no implicit virtues they failed to recognize that the real problem 
was that of the relation between management (individual or collective) and those 
it managed. The real problem was <i>from whom</i> the "one" or the "several" 
managers would derive their authority.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin was not prepared for any concessions on the matter of 
trade-union autonomy: "The Russian Communist Party can in no case agree that 
political leadership alone should belong to the Party and economic leadership to 
the trade unions".<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> 
Krestinsky had denounced Lutovinov's ideas as "syndicalist contraband".<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> 
At Lenin's instigation the Congress called on the unions "to explain to the 
broad circles of the working class that industrial reconstruction can only be 
achieved by a transition to the maximum curtailment of collective administration 
and by the gradual introduction of individual management in units directly 
engaged in production".<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> 
One-man management was to apply to all institutions from State Trusts to 
individual factories. "The elective principle must now be replaced by the 
principle of selection".<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> 
Collective management was "utopian", "impractical" and "injurious".<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> 
The Congress also called for a struggle "against the ignorant conceit 
of...demagogic elements...who think that the working class can solve its problems 
without having recourse to bourgeois specialists in the most responsible posts":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"There could be no place in the ranks of the Party of 
scientific socialism for those demagogic elements which play upon this sort of 
prejudice among the backward sections of the workers".<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Ninth Congress specifically decreed that "no trade-union 
group should directly intervene in industrial management" and that "Factory 
Committees should devote themselves to the questions of labour discipline, of 
propaganda and of education of the workers".<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a> 
To avoid any recurrence of "independent" tendencies among the leaders of the 
trade unions those well-known proletarians Bukharin and Radek were moved on to 
the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions to represent the Party 
leadership and keep a watchful eye on the ARCCTU's proceedings.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> 
All this of course was in flagrant contradiction with the spirit of the 
decisions taken a year earlier, at the Eighth Party Congress, and in particular 
to the famous Point 5 of the Economic Section of the 1919 Party Programme. It 
illustrates quite clearly how vulnerable the working class was to become, once 
it had been forced to relinquish its real power, the power it had once held in 
production, in exchange for a shadowy substitute - political power represented 
by the power of "its" Party. The policy advocated by Lenin was vigorously to be 
followed. In late 1920, of 2,051 important enterprises for which data were 
available, 1,783 were already under "one-man management".<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Ninth Party Congress also saw changes relating to the 
internal Party regime. The Congress had opened to a storm of protests concerning 
this matter. Local Party Committees (at least democratic in form) were being 
made subservient to bureaucratically constituted local "political departments":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"With the institution of such bodies all political activity in 
the plant, industry, organization or locality under their jurisdiction was 
placed under rigid control from above...This innovation...taken from the 
Army...was designed to transmit propaganda downward rather than opinion 
upward".<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Verbal concessions were again made - amid repeated pleas for 
unity. Both at the Congress and later in the year:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the dissidents made the mistake of concentrating on attempts 
to rearrange top political institutions, to reshuffle the forms of political 
control or to introduce new blood into the leadership - while leaving the real 
sources of power relatively unaffected...Organization, they naively believed, 
was the most effective weapon against bureaucracy".<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Ninth Congress finally gave the Orgbureau (set up a year 
earlier and composed of five members of the Central Committee) the right to 
carry out transfers and postings of Party members without reference to the 
Politbureau. As had happened before - and was to happen again repeatedly - 
retrogressive changes in industrial policy went hand in hand with retrogressive 
changes in internal Party structure.</p>

<h4><a name="h8">April</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Trotsky given Commissariat of Transport as well as his Defence 
post. "The Politbureau...offered to back him to the hilt in any action he 
might take, no matter how severe".<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a> 
Those who peddle the myth of an alleged Leninist opposition to Trotsky's methods <i>
at this stage</i>, please note.</p>

<h4><a name="h9">April 6-15</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Third All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions.</b></p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky declared that "the militarization of labour...is the 
indispensable basic method for the organization of our labour forces":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Is it true that compulsory labour is always 
unproductive?...This is the most wretched and miserable liberal prejudice: chattel slavery too 
was productive.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Compulsory slave labour...was in its time a progressive 
phenomenon.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Labour...obligatory for the whole country, compulsory for 
every worker, is the basis of socialism."</p>

<p class="fst">"Wages...must not be viewed from the angle of securing the 
personal existence of the individual worker" but should "measure the 
conscientiousness, and efficiency of the work of every labourer".<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> 
Trotsky stressed that coercion, regimentation and militarization of labour were 
no mere emergency measures. The workers' state normally had the right to coerce <i>
any</i> 
citizen to perform <i>any</i> work, at <i>any</i> time of its choosing.<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a> 
With a vengeance, Trotsky's philosophy of labour came to underline Stalin's 
practical labour policy in the thirties.</p>

<p class="fst">At this Congress Lenin publicly boasted that he had stood for 
one-man management from the beginning. He claimed that in 1918 he "pointed out 
the necessity of recognizing the dictatorial authority of single individuals for 
the purpose of carrying out the Soviet idea"<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a> 
and claimed that at that stage "there were no disputes in connection with the 
question [of one-man management]". This last assertion is obviously untrue - 
even if one's terms of reference are restricted to the ranks of the Party. The 
files of <i>Kommunist</i> 
are there to prove the point!</p>

<h4><a name="h10">June-July</a></h4>

<p class="fst">By the middle of 1920 there had been little if any change in the 
harsh reality of Russian working class life. Years of war, of civil war and of 
wars of intervention, coupled with devastation, sabotage, drought, famine and 
the low initial level of the productive forces, made material improvement 
difficult. But even the vision had now become blurred. In the "Soviet" Russia of 
1920 the industrial workers were "subjected again to managerial authority, 
labour discipline, wage incentives, scientific management - to the familiar 
forms of capitalist industrial organization with the same bourgeois managers, 
qualified only by the State's holding the title to the property.<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A "white" professor who reached Omsk in the autumn of 1919 from 
Moscow reported that</p>

<p class="quoteb">"at the head of many of the centres and <i>glavki</i> sit 
former employers and responsible officials and managers of business. The 
unprepared visitor to the centres who is personally acquainted with the former 
commercial and industrial world would be surprised to see the former owners of 
big leather factories sitting in Clavkozh, big manufacturers in the Central 
textile organizations, etc."<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Under the circumstances it is scarcely surprising that the 
spurious unity achieved at the Ninth Congress a few months earlier did not last. 
Throughout the summer and autumn differences of opinion on such issues as 
bureaucracy within the Party, the relations of the trade unions to the State and 
even the class nature of the State itself were to take on a very sharp form. 
Opposition groups appeared at almost every level. In the latter part of the year 
(after the conclusion of the Russo-Polish war) repressed discontent broke into 
the open. In the autumn Lenin's authority was to be challenged more seriously 
than at any time since the "left" Communist movement of early 1918.</p>

<h4><a name="h11">July</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Publication of Trotsky's classic <b> <i>Terrorism and Communism</i></b> 
(just before the Second Congress of the Communist International). This work 
gives Trotsky's views on the "socialist" organization of labour in their most 
finished, lucid and unambiguous form:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The organization of labour is in its essence the organization 
of the new society: every historical form of society is in its foundation a form 
of organization of labour.<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">The creation of a socialist society means the organization of 
the workers on new foundations, their adaptation to those foundations and their 
labour re-education, with the one unchanging end of the increase in the 
productivity of labour.<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">Wages, in the form of both money and goods, must be brought 
into the closest possible touch with the productivity of individual labour. 
Under capitalism the system of piecework and of grading, the application of the 
Taylor system, etc., have as their object to increase the exploitation of the 
workers by the squeezing out of surplus value. Under socialist production, 
piecework, bonuses, etc., have as their problem to increase the volume of the 
social product...those workers who do more for the general interest than 
others receive the right to a greater quantity of the social product than the 
lazy, the careless and the disorganizers.<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">The very principle of compulsory labour is for the Communist 
quite unquestionable...the only solution to economic difficulties that is 
correct from the point of view both of principle and of practice is to treat the 
population of the whole country as the reservoir of the necessary labour power - 
an almost inexhaustible reservoir - and to introduce strict order into the work 
of its registration, mobilization and utilization.<a href="#n39" name="fn39" target="_self">[39]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">The introduction of compulsory labour service is unthinkable 
without the application, to a greater or lesser degree, of the methods of 
militarization of labour.<a href="#n40" name="fn40" target="_self">[40]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">The unions should discipline the workers and teach them to 
place the interests of production above their own needs and demands.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The young Workers' State requires trade unions not for a 
struggle for better conditions of labour - that is the task of the social and 
state organizations as a whole - but to organize the working class for the ends 
of production.<a href="#n41" name="fn41" target="_self">[41]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">It would be a most crying error to confuse the question as to 
the supremacy of the proletariat with the question of boards of workers at the 
head of factories. The dictatorship of the proletariat is expressed in the 
abolition of private property in the means of production, in the supremacy over 
the whole soviet mechanism of the collective will of the workers [a euphemism 
for the Party (MB)] and not at all in the form in which individual economic 
enterprises are administered.<a href="#n42" name="fn42" target="_self">[42]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">I consider that if the Civil War had not plundered our 
economic organs of all that was strongest, most independent, most endowed with 
initiative, we should undoubtedly have entered the path of one-man management in 
the sphere of economic administration much sooner and much less painfully".<a href="#n43" name="fn43" target="_self">[43]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h12">August</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Due to the Civil War - and to other factors less often mentioned 
such as the attitude of the railway workers to the "new" regime - the Russian 
railways had virtually ceased to function. Trotsky, Commissar for Transport, was 
granted wide emergency powers to try out his theories of "militarization of 
labour". He started by placing the railwaymen and the personnel of the repair 
workshops under martial law. When the railwaymen's trade union objected, he 
summarily ousted its leaders and, <i>with the full support and endorsement of 
the Party leadership</i></p>

<p class="quoteb">"appointed others willing to do his bidding. He repeated the 
procedure in other unions of transport workers".<a href="#n44" name="fn44" target="_self">[44]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h13">Early September</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Setting up of Tsektran</b> (Central Administrative Body of 
Railways). Very much Trotsky's brainchild, it was brought into being as a result 
of a compulsory fusion of the Commissariat of Transport, of the railway unions 
and of the Party organs ("political departments") in this field. The entire 
railroad and water transport systems were to fall within Tsektran's compass. 
Trotsky was appointed its head. He ruled the Tsektran along strictly military 
and bureaucratic lines. "The Politbureau backed him to the hilt, as it had 
promised".<a href="#n45" name="fn45" target="_self">[45]</a> The railways 
were got going again. But the cost to the image of the Party was incalculable. 
Those who wonder why, at a later stage, Trotsky was unable to mobilize mass 
support for his struggle, within the apparatus, against the "Stalinist" 
bureaucracy should meditate on such facts.</p>

<h4><a name="h14">September 22-25</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Ninth Party Conference.</b></p>

<p class="fst">Zinoviev gave the official report on behalf of the Central 
Committee. Sapronov presented a minority report on behalf of the "Democratic 
Centralists" who were well represented. Lutovinov spoke for the recently 
constituted Workers' Opposition. He called for the immediate institution of the 
widest measures of proletarian democracy, the total rejection of the system 
whereby appointments from above were made to nominally elected positions, and 
the purging of the Party of careerist elements who were now joining in droves. 
He also asked that the Central Committee refrain from its constant and 
exaggerated interventions in the life of the trade unions and of the Soviets.</p>

<p class="fst">The leadership had to retreat. Zinoviev evaded answering the main 
complaints. A resolution was passed stressing the need for "full equality within 
the Party" and denouncing "the domination of rank-and-file members by privileged 
bureaucrats". The resolution instructed the Central Committee to proceed by 
means of "recommendations" rather than by appointments from above and to abstain 
from "disciplinary transfers on political grounds".<a href="#n46" name="fn46" target="_self">[46]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Despite these verbal concessions the leadership, through their 
spokesman Zinoviev, succeeded in getting the September Conference to accept the 
setting up of Central and Regional Control Commissions. These were to play an 
important role in the further bureaucratization of the Party - when the early 
incumbents (Dzerzhinsky, Preobrazhensky and Muranov) had been replaced by 
Stalin's henchmen.</p>

<h4><a name="h15">October</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Signature of Peace Treaty with Poland.</p>

<h4><a name="h16">November 2-6</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Fifth All-Russian Trade Union Conference.</b></p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky points out that the parallelism between unions and 
administrative organs, responsible for the prevailing confusion, had to be 
eliminated. This could only be done by the conversion of trade (<i>professionalny</i>) 
unions into production (<i>proizvodstvenny</i>) unions. If the leadership of the 
unions objected, they would have to be "shaken up" as the leaders of the railway 
unions had been. The "winged word" (Lenin) had been uttered!</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Moscow Provincial Party Conference.</b></p>

<p class="fst">Opposition groups within Party shown to be growing rapidly. The 
recently formed Workers' Opposition, the Democratic Centralists and the Ignatov 
group (a local Moscow faction closely allied to the Workers' Opposition and 
later to merge with it) had secured 124 delegates to this Conference against 154 
for supporters of the Central Committee.<a href="#n47" name="fn47" target="_self">[47]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h19">November 8-9</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Meeting of Plenum of Central Committee.</b></p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky submits a "preliminary draft of theses" entitled "The 
Trade Unions and Their Future Role", later published on December 25 - in 
slightly altered form - as a pamphlet, <i>The Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions</i>: 
"It was necessary immediately to proceed to reorganize the trade unions, i.e. to 
select the leading personnel" (Thesis 5). Dizzy with success, Trotsky again 
threatened to "shake up" various trade unions as he had "shaken up those of the 
transport workers".<a href="#n48" name="fn48" target="_self">[48]</a> What was 
needed was "to replace irresponsible agitators [<i>sic</i>!] by 
production-minded trade unionists".<a href="#n49" name="fn49" target="_self">[49]</a> 
Trotsky's theses were put to the vote and defeated by the narrow margin of eight 
votes to seven. Lenin then "bluntly dissociated himself from Trotsky and 
persuaded the Central Committee to do likewise".<a href="#n50" name="fn50" target="_self">[50]</a> 
An alternative resolution proposed by Lenin was then passed by ten votes to 
four. It called for "reform of the Tsektran", advocated "sound forms of the 
militarization of labour"<a href="#n51" name="fn51" target="_self">[51]</a> 
and proclaimed that "the Party ought to educate and support...a new type of 
trade unionist, the energetic and imaginative economic organizer who will 
approach economic issues not from the angle of distribution and consumption but 
from that of expanding production".<a href="#n52" name="fn52" target="_self">[52]</a> 
The latter was clearly the dominant viewpoint. Trotsky's "error" had been that 
he had carried it out to its logical conclusion. But the Party needed a 
sacrificial goat. The Plenum was "to forbid Trotsky to speak in public on the 
relationship between the trade unions and the State".<a href="#n53" name="fn53" target="_self">[53]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h20">December 2</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Trotsky, in a speech to the enlarged Plenum of Tsektran declared 
that</p>

<p class="quoteb">"a competent, hierarchically organized civil service had its 
merits. Russia suffered not from the excess but from the lack of an efficient 
bureaucracy.<a href="#n54" name="fn54" target="_self">[54]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">The militarization of the trade unions and the militarization 
of transport required an internal, ideological militarization".<a href="#n55" name="fn55" target="_self">[55]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Stalin was later to describe Trotsky as "the patriarch of the 
bureaucrats".<a href="#n56" name="fn56" target="_self">[56]</a> When the 
Central Committee again rebuffed him:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Trotsky fretfully reminded Lenin and the other members of how 
often they had privately urged him...to act ruthlessly and disregard 
considerations of democracy. It was disloyal of them...to pretend in public 
that they defended the democratic principle against him".<a href="#n57" name="fn57" target="_self">[57]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h21">December 7</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>At a Plenum of the Central Committee</b> Bukharin had produced 
a resolution on "industrial democracy". The terms were to infuriate Lenin. They 
were "a verbal twist", "a tricky phrase", "confusing", "a squib":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Industry is always necessary. Democracy is not always 
necessary. The term 'industrial democracy' gives rise to a number of utterly 
false ideas.<a href="#n58" name="fn58" target="_self">[58]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">It might be understood to repudiate dictatorship and 
individual management.<a href="#n59" name="fn59" target="_self">[59]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">Without bonuses in kind and disciplinary courts it was just 
empty talk".<a href="#n60" name="fn60" target="_self">[60]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The strongest opposition to Trotsky's schemes for the 
"militarization of labour" came from that section of the Party with the deepest 
roots in the trade unions. Some of these Party members had not only dominated 
the Trade Union Council up to this time but "were also the direct beneficiaries 
of the doctrine of autonomous trade union responsibility".<a href="#n61" name="fn61" target="_self">[61]</a> 
In other words they were already, in part, trade union bureaucrats. It was 
partly from these elements that the Workers' Opposition was to develop.</p>

<p class="fst">By now, however, the leading politico-economic apparatus was 
quite different from the one we saw emerging in 1918. In just over two years the 
Party apparatus had gained undisputed political control of the State (through 
the bureaucratized Soviets). It had also gained almost complete control of the 
economic apparatus (through trade-union officials and appointed industrial 
managers). The various groups had acquired the competence and experience 
necessary to become a social category with a specific function: to manage 
Russia. Their fusion was inevitable.</p>

<h4><a name="h22">December 22-29</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The <b>Eighth All-Russian Congress of Soviets</b> was held in 
Moscow. It provided an opportunity for a public airing of the diverging 
viewpoints on the trade union question which had developed within the Party and 
which could now no longer be contained within its ranks. The degree of 
opposition which had developed to official Party policy can be gauged by the 
contents of Zinoviev's speech:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"We will establish more intimate contacts with the working 
masses. We will hold meetings in the barracks, in the camps and in the 
factories. The working masses will then...understand that it is no joke when 
we proclaim that a new era is about to start, that as soon as we can breathe 
freely again we will transfer our political meetings into the factories...We 
are asked what we mean by workers' and peasants' democracy. I answer: nothing 
more and nothing less than what we meant by it in 1917. We must re-establish the 
principle of election in the workers' and peasants' democracy...If we have 
deprived ourselves of the most elementary democratic rights for workers and 
peasants, it is time we put an end to this state of affairs".<a href="#n62" name="fn62" target="_self">[62]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Zinoviev's concern for democracy did not carry much weight, being 
factionally motivated (it was part of a campaign to discredit Trotsky). At that 
time public orators in search of laughs could usually get them by carefully 
chosen quotations from Zinoviev on the subject of democratic rights.<a href="#n63" name="fn63" target="_self">[63]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h23">December 30</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Joint meeting of the Party fraction to the Eighth Congress of 
Soviets, of Party members on the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions, 
and of Party members in various other organizations, held in the Bolshoi 
Theatre, Moscow, to discuss the "trade union question". All the main 
protagonists were on hand to state their respective cases. The various 
viewpoints, as stated at the meeting (or outlined in articles written at the 
time or within the next few weeks) can be summarized as follows.<a href="#n64" name="fn64" target="_self">[64]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky and particularly Bukharin later amended their original 
proposals in order to constitute a bloc at the Congress.</p>

<p class="fst">For <i>Lenin</i> the trade unions were "reservoirs of state 
power". They were to provide a broad social basis "for the proletarian 
dictatorship exercised by the Party", a base that was badly needed in view of 
the predominantly peasant nature of the country. The unions were to be the 
"link" or "transmission belt" between the Party and the mass of non-Party 
workers. The unions could not be autonomous. They could not play an independent 
role either in the initiation or in the implementation of policy. They had to be 
strongly influenced by Party thinking and would undertake the political 
education of the masses along lines determined by the Party. In this way they 
would become "schools of Communism" for their seven million members.<a href="#r1" name="rn1" target="_self">[1*]</a> 
The Party was to be the teacher: "The Russian Communist Party, in the person of 
its Central and Regional organizations, <i>unconditionally</i> guides as before 
the whole ideological side of the work of the trade unions".<a href="#n65" name="fn65" target="_self">[65]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lenin stressed that the unions could not be instruments of the 
State. Trotsky's assumption that the unions need no longer defend the workers 
because the State was now a workers' state was wrong: "Our state is such that 
the entire organized proletariat must defend itself: we [<i>sic</i>] must use 
these workers' organizations for the defence of the workers from their state <i>
and for the defence of our state by the workers</i>". (The words in italics are 
often omitted when this famous passage is quoted.)</p>

<p class="fst">According to Lenin, militarization was not to be regarded as a 
permanent feature of socialist labour policy. Persuasion had to be used as well 
as coercion. While it was <i>normal</i> [<i>sic</i>!] for the state to appoint 
officials from above (a long, long way had been travelled since the statements 
recorded under the heading of May 20, 1917) it would be inexpedient for the 
trade unions to do the same. The unions could make recommendations for 
administrative-economic jobs and should co-operate in planning. They should 
inspect, through specialized departments, the work of the economic 
administration.</p>

<p class="fst">Wage-rate fixing was to be transferred to the All-Russian Central 
Council of Trade Unions. In relation to wages the extreme egalitarianism of the 
Workers' Opposition had to be fought. Wages policy was to be designed so as to 
"discipline labour and increase its productivity".<a href="#n66" name="fn66" target="_self">[66]</a> 
Party members had</p>

<p class="quoteb">"chattered enough about principles in the Smolny. Now, after 
three years, they had decrees on all points of the production problem.<a href="#n67" name="fn67" target="_self">[67]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">The decisions on the militarization of labour, etc., were 
incontrovertible and there is no need whatsoever to withdraw my words of 
ridicule concerning references to democracy made by those who challenged these 
decisions...we shall extend democracy in the workers' organizations but not 
make a fetish of it..."<a href="#n68" name="fn68" target="_self">[68]</a></p>

<p class="fst"><i>Trotsky</i> reiterated his belief that "the transformation of 
the trade unions into production unions...formed the greatest task of our 
epoch":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The unions ought permanently to assess their membership from the 
angle of production and should always possess a full and precise 
characterization of the productive value of any worker".</p>

<p class="fst">The leading bodies of the trade unions and of the economic 
administration should have between one-third and one-half of their members in 
common in order to put an end to the antagonism between them. Bourgeois 
technicians and administrators who had become full members of a union were to be 
entitled to hold managerial posts, without supervision by commissars. After a 
real minimum wage had been secured for all workers there should be "shock 
competition" (<i>udarnichestvo</i>) between workers in production.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Bukharin's</i> views had been evolving rapidly. What he now 
advocated was an attempt to build a bridge between the official views of the 
Party and those of the Workers' Opposition. There had to be "workers' democracy 
in production". The "governmentalizing of the unions" had to go hand in hand 
with the "unionizing of the state".</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The logical and historical termination [of this process] will 
not be the engulfment of the unions by the proletarian state, but the 
disappearance of both categories - of the unions as well as of the state - and 
the creation of a third: the communistically organized society".<a href="#n69" name="fn69" target="_self">[69]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lenin was to seize upon Bukharin's platform as "a full break with 
Communism and a transition to a position of syndicalism":<a href="#n70" name="fn70" target="_self">[70]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">"It destroyed the need for the Party. If the trade unions, 
nine-tenths of whose members are non-Party workers, appoint the managers of 
industry, what is the use of the Party?"<a href="#n71" name="fn71" target="_self">[71]</a></p>

<p class="fst">"So we have grown up", he added ominously, "from small 
differences to syndicalism, signifying a complete break with Communism and an 
unavoidable split in the Party".<a href="#n72" name="fn72" target="_self">[72]</a> 
Other attacks by Lenin on Bukharin's views are to be found in his famous article 
censuring Trotsky.<a href="#n73" name="fn73" target="_self">[73]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The views of the <i>Workers' Opposition</i> were put to the 
Moscow meeting by Shlyapnikov, a metalworker (and were later to be developed 
more fully by Kollontai and others). Explicitly or implicitly these views 
postulated the domination of the trade unions over the state.</p>

<p class="fst">The Workers' Opposition referred of course to Point 5 of the 1919 
Programme and charged the leadership of the Party with violating its pledges 
towards the trade unions...the leadership of the Party and of Government 
bodies had in the last two years systematically narrowed the scope of trade 
union work and reduced almost to nil the influence of the working class...The 
Party and the economic authorities, having been swamped by bourgeois technicians 
and other non-proletarian elements displayed outward hostility to the 
unions...The remedy was the concentration of industrial management in the hands of the 
trade unions.</p>

<p class="fst">The transition should take place from below up: "At the factory 
level, the Factory Committees should regain their erstwhile dominant position". 
(The Bolshevik trade unionists had taken a long time to come round to this 
viewpoint!) The Opposition proposed more trade union representation in various 
controlling bodies. Not a single person was to be appointed to any 
administrative-economic post without the agreement of the trade unions. 
Officials recommended by the trade unions were to remain accountable for their 
conduct to the unions, who should also have the right to recall them from their 
posts at any time. The programme culminated in the demand that an "All-Russian 
Producers' Congress" be convened to elect the central management of the entire 
national economy. National Congresses of separate unions were similarly to elect 
managements for the various branches of the economy. Local and regional 
managements should be formed by local trade union conferences, while the 
management of single factories was to belong to the Factory Committees, which 
were to remain part of the trade union organization..."In this way", 
Shlyapnikov asserted, "there is created the unity of will which is essential in 
the organization of the economy, and also a real possibility for the influence 
of the initiative of the broad working masses on the organization and 
development of our economy".<a href="#n74" name="fn74" target="_self">[74]</a> 
Last but not least the Workers' Opposition proposed a radical revision of the 
wages policy in an extremely egalitarian spirit: money wages were to be 
progressively replaced by rewards in kind. Within the Party, it was clearly on 
the shoulders of the Workers' Opposition that, at this late stage, fell the task 
of endeavouring to maintain the revolutionary ideals of <i>State and Revolution</i>, 
with respect to the autonomous and democratic involvement of the masses in the 
functions of economic decision taking.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n64" href="#fn64">[64]</a> These summaries are 
based on Deutscher's detailed accounts in <i>Soviet Trade Unions</i>, <i>op. 
cit.</i>, pp. 42-52. In the course of the pre-Congress discussion a great number 
of factions and groups emerged, each with its own views and "thesis" on the 
trade unions. The differences between some of these groups were very subtle 
indeed, and nearly all groups referred to so many common principles that 
sometimes the object of the debate seemed almost unreal. Only three motions were 
finally presented to the Congress: Lenin's (<i>The Platform of the Ten</i>), the 
Trotsky-Bukharin motion and the proposals of the Workers' Opposition. Deutscher 
points out that "a comparison between these motions tends up to a point to 
obscure rather than throw into relief the issue with which the Congress tried to 
come to grips because, for tactical reasons, the authors of every motion 
incorporated passages from their opponents' motions and thereby blurred the real 
differences".</p>
