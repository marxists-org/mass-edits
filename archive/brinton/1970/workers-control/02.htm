<h2><a name="h1">1917</a></h2>

<h4><a name="h2">February</a><a href="#r1" name="rn1" target="_self">[1*]</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Strikes and bread riots in Petrograd. Angry street demonstrations 
against the Government. Troops, sent to restore order, fraternize with 
demonstrators. Soviets reappear in several cities, for the first time since 
1905.</p>

<h4><a name="h3">February 27</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Abdication of Nicholas II. Formation of Provisional Government 
(Prince Lvov as Prime Minister).</p>

<h4><a name="h4">March</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Factory and Shop Committees,<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
Workers' Councils and Councils of Elders appear in every major industrial centre 
of European Russia. From the onset, their demands are not limited to wages or 
hours but challenge many managerial prerogatives.</p>

<p class="fst">In several instances Factory Committees were set up because the 
previous owners or managers had disappeared during the February turmoil. Most of 
those who later drifted back were allowed to resume their positions - but had to 
accept the Factory Committees. "The proletariat", wrote Pankratova,<a href="#r2" name="rn2" target="_self">[2*]</a> 
"without legislative sanction, started simultaneously to create all its 
organizations: Soviets of Workers' Deputies, trade unions and Factory 
Committees".<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> A tremendous 
working-class pressure was developing all over Russia.</p>

<h4><a name="h5">March 10</a></h4>

<p class="fst">First formal capitulation by a significant body of employers. 
Agreement signed between Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and 
Petrograd Manufacturers' Association, granting the eight-hour day in some 
enterprises and "recognizing" some of the Committees. Most other employers 
refused to follow suit. For instance on March 14 the Committee for Commerce and 
Industry declared that "the question of the eight-hour day cannot be resolved by 
reciprocal agreement between workers and employers, because it is a matter of 
state importance." The first major fight of the Factory Committees took place on 
this issue.</p>

<p class="fst">The eight-hour day was soon imposed in Petrograd, either with the 
reluctant consent of the employers or unilaterally by the workers. The 
"recognition" of the Factory Committees proved much more difficult to impose, 
both employers and State recognizing the threat to them inherent in this form of 
organization.</p>

<h4><a name="h6">April 2</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Exploratory Conference of Factory Committees of Petrograd War 
Industries</b>, convened on the initiative of the workers of the Artillery 
Department. This Conference was to proclaim what were, at that time, the most 
advanced "terms of reference" for any Factory Committee. Paragraphs 5 to 7 of 
the proclamation stipulated:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"From the Factory Committee should emanate all instructions 
concerning internal factory organization (i.e. instructions concerning such 
matters as hours of work, wages, hiring and firing, holidays, etc.). The factory 
manager to be kept notified...</p>

<p class="quoteb">The whole administrative personnel (management at all levels 
and technicians) is taken on with the consent of the Factory Committee which has 
to notify the workers of its decisions at mass meetings of the whole factory or 
through shop committees...</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Factory Committee controls managerial activity in the 
administrative, economic and technical fields...representatives of the Factory 
Committee must be provided, for information, with all official documents of the 
management, production budgets and details of all items entering or leaving the 
factory..."<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h7">April 7</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Publication of <i>April Theses</i>, shortly after Lenin had 
returned to Petrograd from abroad. Only reference to workers' control is in 
Thesis 8: "Our immediate task shall not be the 'introduction of socialism' but 
to bring social production and distribution of products...under the control of 
the Soviet of Workers' Deputies".</p>

<h4><a name="h8">April 23</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The new government had to make some verbal concessions. It passed 
a law partially "recognizing" the Committees but carefully restricting their 
influence. All the key issues were left to the "mutual agreement of the parties 
concerned" - in other words there was no <i>statutory</i> obligation on the 
employers to deal directly with the Committees.</p>

<p class="fst">The workers however showed little concern about the provisions of 
the law. "They commented, in their own fashion, on the law of April 23...They 
determined their own terms of reference, in each factory, steadily expanding 
their prerogatives and decided on what their representatives might do, according 
to the relation of forces in each particular instance".<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lenin writes: "Such measures as the nationalization of the land 
and of the banks and syndicates of capitalists, or at least the immediate 
establishment of the <i>control</i> of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies over 
them (measures which do not in any way imply the 'introduction of socialism') 
must be absolutely insisted on and whenever possible introduced by revolutionary 
means". Such measures were "entirely feasible economically" and without them it 
would be "impossible to heal the wounds of the war and prevent the impending 
collapse".<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">To Lenin's basic ideas of workers' control as a "curb on the 
capitalists" and "a means of preventing collapse", a third was soon to be added 
with recurs in much of Lenin's writing of this period. It is the concept of 
workers' control as a "prelude to nationalization". For instance: "We must at 
once prepare the Soviets of Workers' Deputies, the Soviet of Deputies of Bank 
Employees, etc., to proceed to the adoption of feasible and practicable measures 
for the merging of all the banks into one single national bank, to be followed 
by the establishment of the control of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies over the 
banks and syndicates and then by their nationalization".<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h9">May</a></h4>

<p class="fst">More and more employers were "having to cope" with Factory 
Committees. The bourgeois press launched a massive campaign against the 
eight-hour day and the Committees, trying to smear the workers in the eyes of 
the soldiers as lazy, greedy, good-for-nothings, leading the country to ruin 
through their "excessive" demands. The workers' press patiently explains the 
real causes of industrial stagnation and the real conditions of working-class 
life. At the invitation of various Factory Committees, Army delegates were sent 
to "verify" conditions at the rear. Then they publicly testified as to the truth 
of what the workers were saying...</p>

<h4><a name="h10">May 17</a></h4>

<p class="fst">In <i>Pravda</i> Lenin explicitly endorses the slogan of workers' 
control, declaring that "the workers must demand the <i>immediate</i> 
realization of control, <i>in fact</i> and without fail, by the workers 
themselves".<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h11">May 20</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Lenin produces draft for a new Party programme:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The Party fights for a more democratic workers' and peasants' 
republic, in which the police and standing army will be completely abolished and 
replaced by the universally armed people, by a universal militia. All official 
persons will not only be elected but also subject to recall at any time upon the 
demand of a majority of the electors. All official persons, without exception, 
will be paid at a rate not exceeding the average wage of a competent worker."</p>

<p class="fst">At the same time Lenin calls for the "unconditional <i>
participation</i> [my emphasis] of the workers in the control of the affairs of 
the trusts" - which could be brought about "by a decree requiring but a single 
day to draft".<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> The concept 
that "workers' participation" should be introduced by legislative means (i.e. 
from above) clearly has an illustrious ancestry.</p>

<h4><a name="h12">May 29</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Kharkov Conference of Factory Committees.</b> In certain 
respects the provinces were in advance of Petrograd and Moscow. The Kharkov 
Conference demanded that the Factory Committees become "organs of the 
Revolution...aiming at consolidating its victories". "The Factory Committees must take 
over production, protect it, develop it". "They must fix wages, look after 
hygiene, control the technical quality of products, decree all internal factory 
regulations and determine solutions to all conflicts".<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> 
Some non-Bolshevik delegates even proposed that the Committees should take over 
the factories directly and exercise all managerial functions.</p>

<h4><a name="h13">May 30-June 5</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>First full Conference of Petrograd Factory Committees.</b> The 
Conference met in the Tauride Palace, in the same hall where three months 
earlier the State Duma (Parliament) had assembled. At least half the Committee 
represented were from the engineering industry. "The long and flowery speeches 
of the bourgeois parliamentarians had given way to the sincere, simple and 
usually concise contributions of 'deputies' who had just left their tools or 
their machines, to express for the first time in public their humiliations, 
their class needs and their needs as human beings".<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Bolshevik delegates were in a majority. Although most of their 
contributions centred on the need to introduce workers' control as a means of 
"restoring order" and "maintaining production", other viewpoints were also 
voiced. Nemtsov, a Bolshevik metal worker, proclaimed that the</p>

<p class="quoteb">"working of the factories is now in the exclusive hands of 
higher management. We must introduce the principle of election. To assess 
work...we don't need the individual decisions of foremen. By introducing the 
elective principle we can control production."</p>

<p class="fst">Naumov, another delegate, claimed that "by taking into our own 
hands the control of production we will learn about its practical aspects and 
raise it to the level of future socialist production".<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> 
We are a long way here from the later Bolshevik advocacy of the "efficiency" of 
one-man management and from their later practice of appointments from above.</p>

<p class="fst">The Conference was widely attended. Even M. I. Skobelev, 
Menshevik Minister of Labour in the Provisional Government, was to address it. 
His contribution was of interest as a sort of anticipation of what the 
Bolsheviks would be saying before the year was up. Skobelev asserted that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the regulation and control of industry was a task for the 
State. Upon the individual class, especially the working class, lies the 
responsibility for helping the state in its organizational work."</p>

<p class="fst">He also stated that "the transfer of enterprises into the hands 
of the people at the present time would not assist the Revolution". The 
regulation of industry was the function of Government, not of autonomous Factory 
Committees. "The Committees would best serve the workers' cause by becoming 
subordinate units in a state-wide network of trade unions".<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A similar viewpoint was put by Rozanov, one of the founders of 
the Professional Workers' Union. His assertions that the "functions of the 
Factory Committees were ephemeral" and that "Factory Committees should 
constitute the basic elements of the unions" were sharply criticized. Yet this 
is exactly the role to which - within a few months - the Factory Committees were 
to be relegated by Bolshevik practice. At this stage, however, the Bolsheviks 
were critical of the idea (the unions were still largely under Menshevik 
influence).</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin's address to the Conference contained a hint of things to 
come. He explained that workers' control meant "that the majority of workers 
should enter all responsible institutions and that the administration should 
render an account of its actions to the most authoritative workers' 
organizations".<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> Under 
"workers' control" Lenin clearly envisaged an "administration" other than the 
workers themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">The final resolution, supported by 336 of the 421 delegates, 
proclaimed the Factory Committees "fighting organizations, elected on the basis 
of the widest democracy and with a collective leadership". Their objectives were 
the "creation of new conditions of work". The resolution called for "the 
organization of thorough control by labour over production and distribution" and 
for "a proletarian majority in all institutions having executive power".<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The next few weeks witnessed a considerable growth of the Factory 
Committees. Wherever they were strong enough (both before but especially after 
the October Revolution, when they were abetted by local Soviets) the Committees 
"boldly ousted the management and assumed direct control of their respective 
plants".<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h14">June 16</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>First All-Russian Congress of Soviets.</b></p>

<h4><a name="h15">June 20-28</a></h4>

<p class="fst">A trade union conference held in Petrograd passed a resolution 
which stipulated that "the trade unions, defending the rights and interests of 
hired labour...cannot take upon themselves administrative-economic functions 
in production".<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> The Factory 
Committees were relegated to the role of seeing to it "that laws for the defence 
of labour were observed and that collective agreements concluded by the unions 
were also observed". The Factory Committees were to agitate for the entrance of 
all workers of the enterprise into the union. They should "work to strengthen 
and extend the trade unions, contribute to the unity of their fighting action" 
and "increase the authority of the unions in the eyes of unorganized workers".<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This conference, dominated by Mensheviks and Social 
Revolutionaries, had considerable misgivings concerning the Factory Committees. 
It expressed these by advocating that the Committees should be elected <i>on the 
basis of lists drawn up by the trade unions</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolshevik theses, presented to the conference by 
Glebov-Avilov, suggested that for the conduct of workers' control "economic 
control commissions" should be attached to the central administration of the 
unions. These commissions were to be made up of members of the Factory 
Committees and were to co-operate with the latter in each individual enterprise. 
The Factory Committees were not only to perform "control functions" for the 
trade unions but were also to be financially dependent upon the union.<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The conference set up an All-Russian Central Council of Trade 
Unions, to which representatives were elected in proportion to the numerical 
strength of the various political tendencies present at the conference.</p>

<p class="fst">At this stage the Bolsheviks were riding two horses, seeking to 
gain the ascendancy in both the unions and the Committees. They were not averse 
to a considerable amount of double talk in the pursuit of this double objective. 
In unions under strong Menshevik control, the Bolsheviks would press for 
considerable autonomy for the Factory Committees. In unions under their own 
control, they would be far less enthusiastic about the matter.</p>

<p class="fst">It is necessary at this stage to say a few words about the role 
of the unions before and immediately after the February Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Before 1917 the unions had been relatively unimportant in Russian 
labour history. Russian industry was still very young. Under Tsardom (at least 
until the turn of the century) trade-union organization had been illegal and 
persecuted.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In suppressing trade unionism Tsardom unwittingly put a 
premium upon revolutionary political organization...Only the most 
politically-minded workers, those prepared to pay for their conviction with 
prison and exile, could be willing to join trade unions in these 
circumstances...whereas in Britain the Labour Party was created by the trade unions, the 
Russian trade unions from their beginning led their existence in the shadow of 
the political movement."<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The analysis is correct - and moreover of much deeper 
significance than Deutscher probably realized. The Russian trade unions of 1917 
reflected this peculiar development of the Russian working-class movement. On 
the one hand the unions were the auxiliaries of the political parties, which 
utilized them for recruiting purposes and as a mass to be manoeuvred.<a href="#r3" name="rn3" target="_self">[3*]</a> 
On the other hand the union movement, reborn in a sense after February 1917, was 
pushed forward by the more educated workers: the leadership of the various 
unions reflected the predominance of a sort of intellectual elite, favourable at 
first to the Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries, but later won over, in 
varying proportions, to the Bolsheviks.</p>

<p class="fst">It is important to realize that from the beginning of the 
Revolution the unions were tightly controlled by political organizations, which 
used them to solicit support for their various actions. This explains the ease 
with which the Party was able - at a later date - to manipulate the unions. It 
also helps one understand the fact that the unions (and their problems) were 
often to prove the battleground on which political differences between the Party 
leaders were again and again to be fought out. Taken in conjunction with the 
fact that the Party's whole previous development (including its tightly 
centralized structure and hierarchical organizational conceptions) had tended to 
separate it from the working class, one can understand how heavily the cards 
were stacked against any autonomous expression or even voicing of working-class 
aspirations. In a sense these found a freer expression in the Soviets than in 
either the Party or the trade unions.</p>

<p class="fst">Be that as it may trade union membership increased rapidly after 
February, workers taking advantage of their newly won freedom.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"During the first months of 1917 [union] membership rose from 
a few scores of thousands to 1.5 million...But the practical role of the trade 
unions did not correspond to their numerical strength...In 1917 strikes never 
assumed the scale and power they had in 1905...The economic ruin of Russia, 
the galloping inflation, the scarcity of consumers' goods, and so on, made 
normal 'bread and butter' struggle look unreal. In addition the threat of 
mobilization hung over would-be strikers. The working class was in no mood to 
strive for limited economic advantage and partial reforms. The entire social 
order of Russia was at stake."<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h16">June-July</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Persistent efforts of Mensheviks fully to subordinate the Factory 
and Plant Committees to the trade unions. These were successfully resisted by a 
temporary alliance of anarchists - objecting on grounds of principle - and of 
Bolsheviks acting on the basis of tactical considerations.</p>

<p class="fst">The autonomous Factory Committee Movement found its highest 
development and most militant expression in the engineering industry.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> 
This is of particular relevance as it explains the drastic measures the 
Bolsheviks had to resort to, in 1922, to break the independent organizations of 
the engineering workers.</p>

<h4><a name="h17">July 26-August 3</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Sixth Party Congress.</b> Milyutin declares: "We will ride on 
the crest of the economic wave of the movement of the workers and we will turn 
this spontaneous movement into a conscious political movement against the 
existing state power".<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h18">August 7-12</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Second Conference of Factory Committees of Petrograd, its 
Environs, and Neighbouring Provinces</b>, held at the Smolny Institute.</p>

<p class="fst">The Conference resolved that 1/4% of the wages of all workers 
represented should go to support a "Central Soviet of Factory Committees", thus 
made financially independent of the unions.<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> 
Rank-and-file supporters of the Factory Committees viewed the setting up of this 
"Central Soviet" with mixed feelings. On the one hand they sensed the need for 
co-ordination. On the other hand they wanted this co-ordination to be carried 
out from below, by themselves. Many were suspicious of the motives of the 
Bolsheviks, on whose initiative the "Central Soviet" had been bureaucratically 
set up. The Bolshevik Skrypnik spoke of the difficulties of the Central Soviet 
of Factory Committees, attributing them "in part to the workers themselves". 
Factory Committees had been reluctant to free their members for work in the 
Centre. Some of the Committees "refrained from participation in the Central 
Soviet because of Bolshevik predominance in it".<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> 
V. M. Levin, another Bolshevik, was to complain that the workers "didn't 
distinguish between the conception of control and the conception of taking 
possession".<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Second Conference adopted a whole number of statutes, 
regulating the work of the Committees, the duties of the management (<i>sic</i>!), 
procedures for electing the Committees, etc.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> 
"All decrees of Factory Committees" were declared compulsory "for the factory 
administration as well as for the workers and employees - until such time as 
those decrees were abolished by the Committee itself, or by the Central Soviet 
of Factory Committees". The Committees were to meet regularly <i>during working 
hours</i>. Meetings were to be held on days designated by the Committees 
themselves. Members of the Committees were to receive full pay - from the 
employers - while on Committee business. Notice to the appropriate 
administrative personnel was to be deemed sufficient to free a member of the 
Factory Committee from work so that he might fulfill his obligations to the 
Committee. In the periods between meetings, selected members of the Factory 
Committees were to occupy premises, within the factory, at which they could 
receive information from the workers and employees. Factory administrations were 
to provide funds "for the maintenance of the Committees and the conduct of their 
affairs". Factory Committees were to have "control over the composition of the 
administration and the right to dismiss all those who could not guarantee normal 
relations with the workers or who were incompetent for other reasons".</p>

<p class="quoteb">"All administrative factory personnel can only enter into 
service with the consent of the Factory Committee, which must declare its [<i>sic</i>!] 
hirings at a General Meeting of all the factory or through departmental or 
workshop committees."</p>

<p class="fst">The "internal organization" of the factory (working time, wages, 
holidays, etc.) was also to be determined by the Factory Committees. Factory 
Committees were to have their own press and were "to inform the workers and 
employees of the enterprise concerning their resolutions by posting an 
announcement in a conspicuous place". But as the Bolshevik Skrypnik 
realistically reminded the Conference, "we must not forget that these are not 
normal statutes confirmed by the Government. They are our platform, on the basis 
of which we will fight". The basis of the demands was "customary revolutionary 
right".</p>

<h4><a name="h19">August</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Campaign launched by Provisional Government against "Factory 
Committees" in the Railways. Kukel, Vice-Minister for the Navy, proposes 
proclamation of martial law on the Railways and the creation of commissions 
entitled to "dissolve the Committees". (This is the voice of the bourgeoisie in 
August 1917 - not of Trotsky, in August 1920! See <i><a href="05.htm#h12">August 1920</a></i>.)</p>

<p class="fst">At a Government-sponsored "consultation with the rank-and-file" 
held in Moscow on August 10 the catastrophic condition of the Railways was to be 
attributed to the existence of the Railway Committees:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"According to an enquiry conducted at a meeting of Railway 
Managers, 5,531 workers had been nominated to participate in these Committees on 
the 37 main lines. These people were absolved of all commitments to work. On the 
basis of an average minimum of 2,000 rubles, this little business was costing 
the Government 11 million rubles. And this only concerned 37 of the 60 main 
lines..."<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a></p>

<p class="fst">At about the same time Struve, a well-known bourgeois ideologist 
and economist, was writing that "just as in the military field the elimination 
of officers by soldiers leads to the destruction of the Army (because it implies 
a legalization of revolt incompatible with the very existence of the Army), so 
in the economic field: the substitution of managerial power by workers' 
management implies the destruction of normal economic order and life in the 
enterprises".<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A little later in the month a Conference of Employers was held in 
Petrograd. It set up a Union of Employers' Associations. The main function of 
the new organization was described by its president Bymanov as "the elimination 
of interference by the Factory Committees in what are managerial functions".</p>

<h4><a name="h20">August 11</a></h4>

<p class="fst">First issue of <i>Golos Truda</i>, published in Russia under 
banner of the Union of Anarcho-Syndicalist Propaganda.</p>

<h4><a name="h21">August 25</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><i>Golos Truda</i>, in a famous article headed "Questions of the 
Hour", wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"We say to the Russian workers, peasants, soldiers, 
revolutionists: above all, continue the revolution. Continue to organize 
yourselves solidly and to unite your new organizations: your communes, your 
unions, your committees, your soviets. Continue, with firmness and perseverance, 
always and everywhere to participate more and more extensively and more and more 
effectively in the economic life of the country, continue to take into your 
hands, that is into the hands of your organizations, all the raw materials and 
all the instruments indispensable to your labour. Continue the Revolution. Do 
not hesitate to face the solution of the burning questions of the present. 
Create everywhere the necessary organizations to achieve these solutions. 
Peasants, take the land and put it at the disposal of your committees. Workers, 
proceed to put in the hands of and at the disposal of your own social 
organizations - everywhere on the spot - the mines and the subsoil, the 
enterprises and the establishments of all sorts, the works and factories, the 
workshops and the machines."</p>

<p class="fst">A little later, issue No. 15 of the same paper urged its readers 
to</p>

<p class="quoteb">"begin immediately to organize the social and economic life of 
the country on new bases. Then a sort of 'dictatorship of labour' will begin to 
be achieved, easily and in a natural manner. And the people would learn, little 
by little, to do it."</p>

<p class="fst">During this period there were a number of important strikes 
(tannery and textile workers in Moscow, engineering workers in Petrograd, petrol 
workers in Baku, miners in the Donbas).</p>

<p class="quoteb">"There was a common feature to these struggles: the employers 
were prepared to make concessions through increased wages but categorically 
refused to recognize any rights to the Factory Committees. The workers in 
struggle...were prepared to fight to the bitter end not so much on the 
question of wage increases as on the question of the recognition of their 
factory organizations."<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One of the main demands was the transfer to the Committees of the 
rights of hiring and firing. The inadequacies of the "law" of April 23 were by 
now widely realized. Demands for the Soviets to take the power were beginning to 
evoke an echo. "During its struggle for a 'factory constitution' the working 
class had become aware of the need itself to manage production".<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h22">August 28</a></h4>

<p class="fst">In response to an increasing campaign in the bourgeois journals 
against the Factory Committees and "working class anarchism", the Menshevik 
Minister of Labour Skobelev issued his famous "Circular No. 421" forbidding 
meetings of the Factory Committees during working hours ("because of the need to 
devote every energy and every second to intensive work"). The circular 
authorized management to deduct from wages time lost by workers in attending 
Committee meetings. This was at a time when Kornilov was marching on Petrograd, 
and "when the workers were rising, threatening, to the defence of the Revolution 
without considering whether they were doing so during working hours or not".<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a></p>

<p class="fst"><b>Third Conference of Factory Committees.</b> On September 4, 
another circular from the Ministry of Labour had stated that the right of hiring 
and firing of workers belonged to the owners of the enterprise. The Provisional 
Government, by now very alarmed at the growth of the Factory Committees, was 
striving desperately to curtail their power.</p>

<p class="fst">The Menshevik Kolokolnikov attended the Conference as the 
representative of the Ministry of Labour. He defended the circulars. He 
"explained" that the circulars did not deprive the workers of the right of <i>
control over</i> hiring and firing...but only of the right to hire and fire. 
"As the Bolsheviks were themselves to do later Kolokolnikov defined control as 
supervision over policy, as opposed to the right of making policy."<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">At the conference a worker called Afinogenev asserted that "all 
parties, not excluding the Bolsheviks, entice the workers with the promise of 
the Kingdom of God on earth a hundred years from now...We don't need 
improvement in a hundred years time, but now, immediately."<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a> 
The Conference, which only lasted two sessions, decreed that it would seek the 
immediate abolition of the circulars.</p>

<h4><a name="h25">September 14</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Meeting of the Government-sponsored <b>Democratic Conference</b>. 
Emphasizing that the tasks of the Factory Committees were "essentially 
different" from those of the trade unions, the Bolsheviks requested 25 seats for 
the Factory Committees. (The same number had been allocated by the Government to 
the unions.)</p>

<h4><a name="h26">September 26</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Lenin writes: "The Soviet Government must immediately introduce 
throughout the state workers' control over production and distribution". 
"Failing such control...famine and catastrophe of unprecedented dimensions 
threaten the country from week to week".<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a></p>

<p class="fst">For several weeks the employers had been resorting to lockouts on 
an increasing scale in an attempt to break the power of the Committees. Between 
March and August 1917, 586 enterprises employing over 100,000 workers had been 
closed down,<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a> sometimes because 
of the lack of fuel or raw materials but often as a deliberate attempt by the 
employers to evade the increasing power of the Committees. One of the functions 
of workers' control was seen as putting an end to such practices.</p>

<h4><a name="h27">October 1</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Publication of Lenin's <i>Can the Bolsheviks Retain State Power?</i> 
This text contains certain passages which help one understand many subsequent 
events:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"When we say workers' control, always associating that slogan 
with the dictatorship of the proletariat, and always putting it after the 
latter, we thereby make plain what state we have in mind...If it is a 
proletarian state we are referring to (i.e. the dictatorship of the proletariat) 
then workers' control can become a national, all-embracing, omnipresent, 
extremely precise and extremely scrupulous <i>accounting</i> [emphasis in 
original] of the production and distribution of goods."</p>

<p class="fst">In the same pamphlet Lenin defines the type of "socialist 
apparatus" (or framework) within which the function of accountancy (workers' 
control) will be exercised:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"<i>Without big banks socialism would be impossible of 
realization</i>. The big banks are a 'stable apparatus' we need for the 
realization of socialism and which we shall <i>take from capitalism ready made</i>. 
Our problem here is only to lop away that <i>which capitalistically disfigures</i> 
this otherwise excellent apparatus and to make it still <i>bigger</i>, still 
more democratic, still more comprehensive...</p>

<p class="quoteb">A single huge state bank, with branches in every rural 
district and in every factory - that will already be <i>nine-tenths of a 
socialist apparatus</i>."</p>

<p class="fst">According to Lenin this type of apparatus would allow "general 
state <i>book-keeping</i>, general state accounting of the production and 
distribution of goods", and would be "something in the nature, so to speak, of 
the <i>skeleton</i> of a socialist society".<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">No one disputes the importance of keeping reliable records, but 
Lenin's identification of workers' control in a "workers' state" with the 
function of accountancy (i.e. checking the implementation of decisions taken by 
others) is extremely revealing. Nowhere in Lenin's writings is workers' control 
ever equated with fundamental decision-taking (i.e. with the initiation of 
decisions) relating to production (how much to produce, how to produce it, at 
what cost, at whose cost, etc.).</p>

<p class="fst">Other writings by Lenin in this period reiterate that one of the 
functions of workers' control is to prevent sabotage by the higher bureaucrats 
and functionaries:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"As for the higher employees...we shall have to treat them 
as we treat the capitalists - roughly. They, like the capitalists, will offer 
resistance...we may succeed with the help of workers' control in rendering 
such resistance impossible."<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lenin's notions of workers' control (as a means of preventing 
lockouts) and his repeated demands for the "opening of the books" (as a means of 
preventing economic sabotage) referred both to the immediate situation, <i>and 
to the months which were to follow the Revolution</i>. He envisaged a period 
during which, in a workers' state, the bourgeoisie would still retain the formal 
ownership and effective management of most of the productive apparatus. The new 
state, in Lenin's estimation, would not be able immediately to take over the 
running of industry. There would be a transitional period during which the 
capitalists would be coerced into co-operation. "Workers' control" was seen as 
the instrument of this coercion.</p>

<h4><a name="h28">October 10</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Fourth Conference of Factory Committees of Petrograd and its 
Environs.</b></p>

<p class="fst">The main business on the agenda was the convocation of the first 
All-Russian Conference of Factory Committees.</p>

<h4><a name="h29">October 13</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><i>Golos Truda</i> calls for "total workers' control, embracing 
all plant operations, real and not fictitious control, control over work rules, 
hiring and firing, hours and wages and the procedures of manufacture".</p>

<p class="fst">Soviets and Factory Committees were appearing everywhere at a 
phenomenal rate. Their growth can be explained by the extremely radical nature 
of the tasks confronting the working class. Soviets and Committees were far more 
closely associated with the realities of everyday life than were the unions. 
They therefore proved far more effective mouthpieces of fundamental popular 
aspirations.</p>

<p class="fst">During this period intensive propaganda was conducted for 
libertarian ideas:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Not a single newspaper was closed, not a single leaflet, 
pamphlet or book confiscated, not a single rally or mass meeting 
forbidden...True the Government at that period was not averse to dealing severely with both 
Anarchists and Bolsheviks. Kerensky threatened many times to 'burn them out with 
red hot irons'. But the Government was powerless, because the Revolution was in 
full swing."<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As already pointed out, the Bolsheviks <i>at this stage</i> still 
supported the Factory Committees. They saw them as "the battering ram that would 
deal blows to capitalism, organs of class struggle created by the working class 
on its own ground".<a href="#n39" name="fn39" target="_self">[39]</a> They also 
saw in the <i>slogan</i> of "workers' control" a means of undermining Menshevik 
influence in the unions. But the Bolsheviks were being "carried along by a 
movement which was in many respects embarrassing to them but which, as a main 
driving force of the revolution, they could not fail to endorse"<a href="#n40" name="fn40" target="_self">[40]</a>. 
During the middle of 1917 Bolshevik support for the Factory Committees was such 
that the Mensheviks were to accuse them of "abandoning" Marxism in favour of 
anarchism.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Actually Lenin and his followers remained firm upholders of 
the Marxist conception of the centralized state. Their immediate objective, 
however, was not yet to set up the centralized proletarian dictatorship, but to 
decentralize as much as possible the bourgeois state and the bourgeois economy. 
This was a necessary condition for the success of the revolution. In the 
economic field therefore, the Factory Committee, the organ on the spot, rather 
than the trade union was the most potent and deadly instrument of upheaval. Thus 
the trade unions were relegated to the background..."<a href="#n41" name="fn41" target="_self">[41]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This is perhaps the most explicit statement of why the Bolsheviks 
at this stage supported workers' control and its organizational vehicle, the 
Factory Committees. Today only the ignorant or those willing to be deceived can 
still kid themselves into believing that proletarian power, <i>at the point of 
production</i> was ever a fundamental tenet or objective of Bolshevism.</p>

<h4><a name="h30">October 17-22</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>First All-Russian Conference of Factory Committees</b>, 
convened by <i>
Novy Put</i> (New Path) a paper "strongly coloured with a new kind of 
anarcho-syndicalism, though no anarcho-syndicalists were on its staff".<a href="#n42" name="fn42" target="_self">[42]</a></p>

<p class="fst">According to later Bolshevik sources, of the 137 delegates 
attending the Conference there were 86 Bolsheviks, 22 Social Revolutionaries, 11 
anarcho-syndicalists, 8 Mensheviks, 6 "maximalists" and 4 "non-party".<a href="#n43" name="fn43" target="_self">[43]</a> 
The Bolsheviks were on the verge of seizing power, and their attitude to the 
Factory Committees was already beginning to change. Shmidt, future Commissar for 
Labour in Lenin's government, described what had happened in many areas:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"At the moment when the Factory Committees were formed, the 
trade unions actually did not yet exist. The Factory Committees filled the 
vacuum."<a href="#n44" name="fn44" target="_self">[44]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Another Bolshevik speaker stated:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the growth of the influence of the Factory Committees has 
naturally occurred at the expense of centralized economic organizations of the 
working class such as the trade unions. This of course is a highly abnormal 
development which has in practice led to very undesirable results."<a href="#n45" name="fn45" target="_self">[45]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A different viewpoint was stressed by a delegate from Odessa. He 
declared that "the Control Commissions must not be mere checking commissions but 
must be the cells of the future, which even now are preparing for the transfer 
of production into the hands of the workers".<a href="#n46" name="fn46" target="_self">[46]</a> 
An anarchist speaker argued:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the trade unions wish to devour the Factory Committees. There 
is no popular discontent with the Factory Committees, but there is discontent 
with the trade unions. To the worker the trade union is a form of organization 
imposed from without. The Factory Committee is closer to them."</p>

<p class="fst">Returning to a theme that was to recur repeatedly he also 
emphasized that "the Factory Committees were cells of the future...They, not 
the State, should now administer".<a href="#n47" name="fn47" target="_self">[47]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lenin at this stage saw the tremendous importance of the Factory 
Committees...as a means of helping the Bolshevik Party to seize power. 
According to Ordzhonikidze he asserted:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"we must shift the centre of gravity to the Factory 
Committees. The Factory Committees must become the organs of insurrection. We 
must change our slogan and instead of saying 'All Power to the Soviets' we must 
say 'All Power to the Factory Committees'."<a href="#n48" name="fn48" target="_self">[48]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A resolution was passed at the Conference proclaiming that 
"workers' control - <i>within the limits assigned to it by the Conference</i> - 
was only possible under the political and economic rule of the working class". 
It warned against "isolated" and "disorganized" activities and pointed out that 
"the seizure of factories by the workers and their operation for personal profit 
was incompatible with the aims of the proletariat".<a href="#n49" name="fn49" target="_self">[49]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h32">October 26</a></h4>

<p class="fst">At Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, Bolshevik spokesmen 
proclaimed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The Revolution has been victorious. All power has passed to 
the Soviets...New laws will he proclaimed within a few days dealing with 
workers' problems. One of the most important will deal with workers' control of 
production and with the return of industry to normal conditions. Strikes and 
demonstrations are harmful in Petrograd. We ask you to put an end to all strikes 
on economic and political issues, to resume work and to carry it out in a 
perfectly orderly manner...Every man to his place. The best way to support the 
Soviet Government these days is to carry on with one's job."<a href="#n50" name="fn50" target="_self">[50]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Without apparently batting an eyelid Pankratova could write that 
"the first day of workers' power was ushered in by this call to work and to the 
edification of the new kind of factory".<a href="#n51" name="fn51" target="_self">[51]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Publication of <b> <i>Decree on the Land</i></b>. Lands of 
nobility, church and crown transferred to custody of peasants.</p>

<h4><a name="h33">November 3</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Publication in <i>Pravda</i> of Lenin's "Draft Decree on Workers' 
Control".<a href="#n52" name="fn52" target="_self">[52]</a> This provided for 
the "introduction of workers' control of the production, warehousing, purchase 
and sale of all products and raw materials in all industrial, commercial, 
banking, agricultural and other enterprises employing a total of not less than 
five workers and employees - or with a turnover of not less than 10,000 rubles 
per annum".</p>

<p class="fst">Workers' control was to be "carried out by all the workers and 
employees in a given enterprise, either directly if the enterprise is small 
enough to permit it, or through delegates to be immediately elected at mass 
meetings". Elected delegates were to "have access to all books and documents and 
to all warehouses and stocks of material, instruments and products, without 
exception".</p>

<p class="fst">These excellent, and often quoted, provisions in fact only listed 
and legalized what had already been achieved and implemented in many places by 
the working class in the course of the struggles of the previous months. They 
were to be followed by three further provisions, of ominous import. It is amazing 
that these are not better known. In practice they were soon to nullify the 
positive features of the previous provisions. They stipulated (point 5) that 
"the decisions of the elected delegates of the workers and employees were 
legally binding upon the owners of enterprises" but that they could be "<i>annulled 
by trade unions and congresses</i>" (our emphasis). This was exactly the fate 
that was to befall the decisions of the elected delegates of the workers and 
employees: the trade unions proved to be the main medium through which the 
Bolsheviks sought to break the autonomous power of the Factory Committees.</p>

<p class="fst">The Draft Decree also stressed (point 6) that "in all enterprises 
of state importance" all delegates elected to exercise workers' control were to 
be "answerable to the State for the maintenance of the strictest order and 
discipline and for the protection of property". Enterprises "of importance to 
the State" were defined (point 7) - and this has a familiar tone for all 
revolutionaries - as "<i>all enterprises working for defence purposes</i>, <i>or 
in any way connected with the production of articles necessary for the existence 
of the masses of the population</i>" (our emphasis). In other words practically 
any enterprise could be declared by the new Russian State as "of importance to 
the State". The delegates from such an enterprise (elected to exercise workers' 
control) were now made answerable to a higher authority. Moreover if the trade 
unions (already fairly bureaucratized) could "annul" the decisions of 
rank-and-file delegates, what real power in production had the rank and file? 
The Decree on Workers' Control was soon proved, in practice, not to be worth the 
paper it was written on.<a href="#r4" name="rn4" target="_self">[4*]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h34">November 9</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Decree dissolving Soviet in the People's Commissariat of Posts 
and Telegraphs.<a href="#n53" name="fn53" target="_self">[53]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The concept of workers' control had spread even to the Civil 
Service. A Soviet of Employees had taken control of the People's Commissariat of 
Posts and Telegraphs and another had established itself in the Admiralty. On 
November 9 an appeal was issued by the People's Commissar for the Ministry (<i>sic</i>) 
of Posts and telegraphs which concluded: "I declare that no so-called initiatory 
groups or committees for the administration of the department of Posts and 
Telegraphs can usurp the functions belonging to the central power and to me as 
People's Commissar".<a href="#n54" name="fn54" target="_self">[54]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h35">November 14</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Lenin expected his "draft statutes on Workers' Control" to be 
ratified, with only minor modifications, by the All-Russian Central Executive 
Committee of the Soviets (V.Ts.I.K.) and by the Council of People's Commissars (<i>Sovnarkom</i>). 
In fact his proposals were to give rise to heated discussion and to be 
criticized from both right and left. Lozovsky, a Bolshevik trade unionist, was 
to write:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"To us, it seemed that the basic control units should only act 
within limits rigorously determined by higher organs of control. But the 
comrades who were for the decentralization of workers control were pressing for 
the independence and autonomy of these lower organs, because they felt that the 
masses themselves would incarnate the principle of control."<a href="#n55" name="fn55" target="_self">[55]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lozovsky believed that</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the lower organs of control must confine their activities 
within the limits set by the instructions of the proposed All-Russian Council of 
Workers' Control. We must say it quite clearly and categorically, so that 
workers in various enterprises don't go away with the idea that the factories 
belong to them."</p>

<p class="fst">Despite heated protests from the rank and file - and after nearly 
two weeks of controversy - a "compromise" was adopted in which the trade unions 
- now the "unexpected champions of order, discipline and centralized direction 
of production"<a href="#n56" name="fn56" target="_self">[56]</a> - had clearly 
won the upper hand. The new text was adopted by the All-Russian Central 
Executive Committee of the Soviets (V.Ts.I.K.) on November 14 (by 24 votes to 
10), ratified by the Council of People's Commissars on November 15 and released 
the following day. Milyutin, who presented the revised decree to the V.Ts.I.K., 
explained somewhat apologetically that "life overtook us" and that it had become 
urgently necessary to "unite into one solid state apparatus the workers' control 
which was being operated on the spot". "Legislation on workers' control which 
should logically have fitted into the framework of an economic plan had had to 
precede legislation on the plan itself.<a href="#n57" name="fn57" target="_self">[57]</a> 
There could be no clearer recognition of the tremendous pressures from below and 
of the difficulties the Bolsheviks were experiencing in their attempts to 
canalize them.</p>

<p class="fst">In the revised decree Lenin's eight original points had now 
increased to fourteen.<a href="#n58" name="fn58" target="_self">[58]</a> The new 
decree started with the ingenious statement that: "In the interests of a planned 
regulation of the national economy" the new Government "recognized the authority 
of workers' control throughout the economy". But there had to be a firm 
hierarchy of control organs. Factory Committees would be "allowed" to remain the 
control organ of each individual enterprise. But each Committee was to be 
responsible to a "Regional Council of Workers' Control", subordinated in turn to 
an "<b>All-Russian Council of Workers' Control</b>".<a href="#n59" name="fn59" target="_self">[59]</a> 
The composition of these higher organs was decided by the Party.</p>

<p class="fst">The trade unions were massively represented in the middle and 
higher strata of this new pyramid of "institutionalized workers' control". For 
instance the All-Russian Council of Workers' Control was to consist of 21 
"representatives": five from the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the 
Soviets, five from the Executive of the All-Russian Council of Trade Unions, 
five from the Association of Engineers and Technicians, two from the Association 
of Agronomists, two from the Petrograd Trade Union Council, one from each 
All-Russian Trade Union Federation numbering fewer than 100,000 members (two for 
Federations of over this number)...and five from the All-Russian Council of 
Factory Committees! The Factory Committees often under anarcho-syndicalist 
influence had been well and truly "cut down to size".</p>

<p class="fst">Long gone were the days when Lenin had asserted "the source of 
power is not a law previously discussed and passed by parliament, but the direct 
initiative of the masses from below, in their localities - outright 'seizure', 
to use a popular expression".<a href="#n60" name="fn60" target="_self">[60]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The very mention however in the decree of an "All-Russian Council 
of Factory Committees" meant that side by side with the "official" structure of 
organs of "workers' control" another structure was still present, almost 
inevitably antagonistic: the pyramid of organs representing the Factory 
Committees. It also shows that the Factory Committee Movement was still seeking 
to co-ordinate its activities on a nationwide basis. Even this minor 
representation for the Factory Committees had been a tactical concession on 
Lenin's part and events were soon to show that the leaders of the Russian 
government had no intention of accepting for long this potential threat to the 
hegemony of the Party and of its supporters within the unions. The Party got to 
work. "Those who had paid most lip-service to workers' control and purported to 
'expand' it were in fact engaged in a skilful attempt to make it orderly and 
innocuous by turning it into a large scale, centralized, public institution".<a href="#n61" name="fn61" target="_self">[61]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Bolshevik propaganda, in later years, was constantly to reiterate 
the theme that the Factory Committees were not a suitable instrument for 
organizing production on a national scale. Deutscher for instance claims that, 
almost from their creation, the "anarchic characteristics of the Committees made 
themselves felt: every Factory Committee aspired to have the last and final say 
on all matters affecting the factory, its output, its stocks of raw material, 
its conditions of work, etc., and paid little or no attention to the needs of 
industry as a whole".<a href="#n62" name="fn62" target="_self">[62]</a> Yet in 
the very next sentence Deutscher points out that</p>

<p class="quoteb">"a few weeks after the upheaval [the October Revolution] the 
Factory Committees attempted to form <i>their own</i> national organization, 
which was to secure their virtual economic dictatorship. The Bolsheviks now 
called upon the trade unions to render a special service to the nascent Soviet 
State and to discipline the Factory Committees. The unions came out firmly 
against the attempt of the Factory Committees to form a national organization of 
their own. They prevented the convocation of a planned All-Russian Congress of 
Factory Committees and demanded total subordination on the part of the 
Committees."</p>

<p class="fst">The essential precondition for the Committees to have started 
tackling regional and national tasks was their federation on a regional and 
national basis. It is the height of hypocrisy for latter-day Bolsheviks to blame 
the Committees of 1917-18 for showing only parochial preoccupations when the 
Party itself was to do all in its power to prevent the Committees from 
federating from below, in an autonomous manner. The Bolshevik-sponsored "Central 
Soviet of Factory Committees" was wound up, after the overthrow of the 
Provisional Government, as quickly as it had been set up. The Revolutionary 
Centre of Factory Committees, a body of anarchist inspiration which had been 
going for several months, never succeeded in supplanting it, so many were the 
obstacles put in its path.</p>

<p class="fst">Some comments are called for in relation to these developments. 
The disorganization created by the war and by the resistance of the employing 
class (manifested as sabotage or desertion of their enterprises) clearly made it 
imperative to minimize and if possible eliminate unnecessary struggles, <i>
between Factory Committees</i>, such as struggles for scanty fuel or raw 
materials. There was clearly a need to co-ordinate the activity of the 
Committees on a vast scale, a need of which many who had been most active in the 
Committee Movement were well aware. The point at issue is not that a functional 
differentiation was found necessary between the various organs of working-class 
power (Soviets, Factory Committees, etc.) or that a definition was sought as to 
what were local tasks and what were regional or national tasks. The modalities 
of such a differentiation could have been - and probably would have been - 
determined by the proposed Congress of Factory Committees. The important thing 
is that a <i>hierarchical</i> pattern of differentiation was <i>externally</i> 
elaborated and imposed, by an agency <i>other than</i> the producers themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">A Bolshevik spokesman described the situation, as seen through 
the eyes of those now in power: "Instead of a rapid normalization of production 
and distribution, instead of measures which would have led towards a socialist 
organization of society, we found a practice which recalled the anarchist dreams 
of autonomous productive communes".<a href="#n63" name="fn63" target="_self">[63]</a> Pankratova puts the matter even more bluntly:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"During the transitional period one had to accept the negative 
aspects of workers' control, which was just a method of struggle between capital 
and labour. But once power had passed into the hands of the proletariat [i.e. 
into the hands of the Party] the practice of the Factory Committees of acting as 
if they owned the factories became anti-proletarian."<a href="#n64" name="fn64" target="_self">[64]</a></p>

<p class="fst">These subtleties were however above the heads of most workers. 
They took Bolshevik propaganda about workers' control at face value. They didn't 
see it as "something transitional" or as "just a stage towards other methods of 
normalization of economic life".<a href="#n65" name="fn65" target="_self">[65]</a> 
For them it was not just a means of combating the economic sabotage of the 
ruling class or a correct tactical slogan, decided in committee as "appropriate" 
to a given stage of the "developing revolution". For the masses "workers' 
control" was the expression of their deepest aspirations. Who would be boss in 
the factory? Instinctively they sensed that who managed production would manage 
all aspects of social life. The subtle difference between "control" and 
"management" of which most Bolsheviks were deeply aware<a href="#r5" name="rn5" target="_self">[5*]</a> 
eluded the masses. The misunderstanding was to have bloody repercussions.</p>

<p class="fst">The November 1917 Decree on Workers' Control appeared to give 
official sanction to the drive of the working class towards total domination of 
the conditions of its life. A metalworkers' paper wrote that "the working class 
by its nature...should occupy the central place both in production and 
especially in its organization...All production in the future 
will...represent a reflection of the proletarian will and mind".<a href="#n66" name="fn66" target="_self">[66]</a> 
Whereas before October workers' control had usually taken a passive, 
observational form, workers' committees now took on an increasingly important 
role in the overall management of various enterprises. "For several months 
following the Revolution the Russian working class enjoyed a degree of freedom 
and a sense of power probably unique in its history".<a href="#n67" name="fn67" target="_self">[67]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There is unfortunately little detailed information available 
concerning this most interesting period. The data available usually comes from 
sources (either bourgeois or bureaucratic) fundamentally hostile to the very 
idea of workers' management and solely concerned in proving its "inefficiency" 
and "impracticability". An interesting account of what happened at the Nobel Oil 
refinery has been published.<a href="#n68" name="fn68" target="_self">[68]</a> 
This illustrates the fundamental tendency of the working class towards 
self-management and the hostility it encountered in Party circles. Other 
examples will doubtless come to light.</p>

<h4><a name="h36">November 28</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Meeting of the newly decreed All-Russian Council of Workers' 
Control.</p>

<p class="fst">The previous disagreements reappeared.<a href="#n69" name="fn69" target="_self">[69]</a> Larin, representative of the Bolshevik fraction in the unions, declared that</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the trade unions represent the interests of the class as a 
whole whereas the Factory Committees only represent particular interests. The 
Factory Committees should be subordinated to the trade unions."</p>

<p class="fst">Zhivotov, spokesman of the Factory Committee movement, declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In the Factory Committees we elaborate instructions which 
come from below, with a view to seeing how they can be applied to industry as a 
whole. These are the instructions of the workshop, of life itself. They are the 
only instructions that can have real meaning. They show what the Factory 
Committees are capable of, and should therefore come to the forefront in 
discussions of workers' control."</p>

<p class="fst">The Factory Committees felt that</p>

<p class="quoteb">"control was the task of the committee in each establishment. 
The committees of each town should then meet...and later establish 
co-ordination on a regional basis."</p>

<p class="fst">The setting up of the All-Russian Council of Workers' Control by 
the Bolsheviks was clearly an attempt to bypass the Committee movement. The 
attempt proved partly successful. The Factory Committees continued their 
agitation. But their voice, silenced by administrative means, only evoked a 
feeble echo within the All-Russian Council itself dominated as it was by Party 
nominees.</p>

<p class="fst">In January 1918 Ryazanov was to declare that the body had only 
met once (and in May 1918 that it had never really met at all). According to 
another source it "tried to meet" but couldn't gather a quorum.<a href="#n70" name="fn70" target="_self">[70]</a></p>

<p class="fst">What is certain is that it never really functioned at all. It is 
difficult to say whether this was due to systematic Bolshevik boycott and 
obstruction, to lack of understanding on the part of non-Bolshevik 
revolutionaries as to what was actually happening, or whether it was due to the 
genuine weakness of the movement, unable to burst through the bureaucratic 
straitjacket in which it was being progressively incarcerated. All three factors 
probably played a part.</p>

<h4><a name="h37">November 28</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Decree dissolving Soviet in the Admiralty.<a href="#n71" name="fn71" target="_self">[71]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h38">December 5</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Decree issued<a href="#n72" name="fn72" target="_self">[72]</a> 
setting up a 
<b>Supreme Economic Council</b> (Vesenka) to which were assigned the tasks of 
working out "a plan for the organization of the economic life of the country and 
the financial resources of the government". The Vesenka was to "direct to a 
uniform end" the activities of all existing economic authorities, central and 
local, including the All-Russian Council of Workers' Control.<a href="#n73" name="fn73" target="_self">[73]</a> 
The Vesenka was to be "attached to the Council of People's Commissars" (itself 
made up entirely of members of the Bolshevik Party).</p>

<p class="fst">The composition of the Vesenka was instructive. It comprised a 
few members of the All-Russian Council of Workers' Control (a very indirect sop 
to the Factory Committees), massive representation from all the new 
Commissariats and a number of experts, nominated from above in a "consultative 
capacity". The Vesenka was to have a double structure: (a) the "centres" 
(Glavki), designed to deal with different sectors of industry, and (b) the 
regional organs: the "local Council of National Economy" (Sovnarkhozy).</p>

<p class="fst">At first the "left" Bolsheviks held a majority of the leading 
positions on the Vesenka. The first Chairman was Osinsky and the governing 
bureau included Bukharin, Sakolnikov, Milyutin, Lomov and Schmidt. Despite its 
"left" leadership the new body "absorbed" the All-Russian Council of Workers' 
Control before the latter had even got going. This step was openly acknowledged 
by the Bolsheviks as a move towards "statization" (<i>ogosudarstvleniye</i>) of 
economic authority. The net effect of the setting up of Vesenka was to silence 
still further the voice of the Factory Committees. As Lenin put it a few weeks 
later, "we passed from workers' control to the creation of the Supreme Council 
of National Economy".<a href="#n74" name="fn74" target="_self">[74]</a> The 
function of this Council was clearly to "replace, absorb and supersede the 
machinery of workers' control."<a href="#n75" name="fn75" target="_self">[75]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A process can now be discerned, of which the rest of this 
pamphlet will seek to unravel the unfolding. It is a process which leads, within 
a short period of four years, from the tremendous upsurge of the Factory 
Committee Movement (a movement which both implicitly and explicitly sought to 
alter the relations of production) to the establishment of unquestioned 
domination by a monolithic and bureaucratic agency (the Party) over all aspects 
of economic and political life. This agency not being based on production, its 
rule could only epitomize the continued limitation of the authority of the 
workers in the productive process. This necessarily implied the perpetuation of 
hierarchical relations within production itself, and therefore the perpetuation 
of class society.</p>

<p class="fst">The first stage of this process was the subordination of the 
Factory Committees to the All-Russian Council for Workers' Control in which the 
unions (themselves already strongly under Party influence) were heavily 
represented. The second phase - which almost immediately followed the first - 
was the incorporation of this All-Russian Council for Workers' Control into the 
Vesenka, even more heavily weighted in favour of the unions, but also comprising 
direct nominees of the State (i.e. of the Party). The Vesenka was momentarily 
allowed to retain a "left" Communist leadership. A little later these "lefts" 
were to be removed. A sustained campaign was then launched to curb the power of 
the unions which, albeit in a very indirect and distorted way, could still be 
influenced by the working class. It was particularly important to curb such 
power as the unions still held in relation to production - and to replace it by 
the authority of direct Party nominees. These managers and administrators, 
nearly all appointed from above, gradually came to form the basis of the new 
bureaucracy.</p>

<p class="fst">Each of these steps was to be resisted, but each fight was to be 
lost. Each time the adversary appeared in the garb of the new "proletarian" 
power. And each defeat was to make it more difficult for the working class 
itself directly to manage production, i.e. fundamentally to alter the relations 
of production. Until these relations of production had been altered the 
revolution could not really be considered to have achieved its socialist 
objective, whatever the pronouncements of its leaders. This is the real lesson 
of the Russian Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The problem can be envisaged in yet another way. The setting up 
of the Vesenka represents a partial fusion - in a position of economic authority 
- of trade-union officials, Party stalwarts and "experts" nominated by the 
"workers' state". But these are not three social categories "representing the 
workers". They were three social categories which were already assuming 
managerial functions - i.e. were already dominating the workers in production. 
Because of <i>their own</i> antecedent history each of these groups was, for 
different reasons, already somewhat remote from the working class. Their fusion 
was to enhance this separation. The result is that from 1918 on, the new State 
(although officially described as a "workers' state" or a "soviet republic" - 
and although by and large supported by the mass of the working class during the 
Civil War) was not in fact an institution managed by the working class.<a href="#r6" name="rn6" target="_self">[6*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">If one can read between the lines (and not be blinded by terms 
such as "workers' state" and "socialist perspective", which only reflect the 
false consciousness so prevalent at the time), the following account by 
Pankratova as to what was at stake in the formation of the Vesenka is most 
informative. "We needed", she said,</p>

<p class="quoteb">"a more efficient form of organization than the Factory 
Committees and a more flexible tool than workers' control. We had to link the 
management of the new factories to the principle of a single economic plan and 
we had to do it in relation to the socialist perspectives of the young workers' 
state...the Factory Committees lacked practice and technical know-how...The 
enormous economic tasks of the transition period towards socialism necessitated 
the creation of a single organism to normalize the national economy on a 
state-wide basis. The proletariat understood this. [This was wishful thinking, if 
ever there was (MB).] Freeing the Factory Committees of their mandates, which no 
longer corresponded to the new economic needs, the workers delegated authority 
to the newly created organs, the Council of National Economy."</p>

<p class="fst">She concludes with a telling sentence: "The Petrograd Factory 
Committees, which in May 1917 had proclaimed the need for workers' control, 
unanimously buried the idea at the time of the Sixth Conference".<a href="#n76" name="fn76" target="_self">[76]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Subsequent events were to show that although these were the aims 
and perspectives of the Party leadership, they were far from being accepted by 
the Party rank and file, let alone by the masses, "on whose behalf the Party was 
already assuming the right to speak.</p>

<h4><a name="h39">December (Early)</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Publication of Lenin's <i>State and Revolution</i> (which had 
been written a few months earlier). In this major theoretical work there is 
little discussion of workers' control and certainly no identification of 
socialism with "workers' management of production". Lenin speaks in rather 
abstract terms of "immediate change such that all fulfil the functions of 
control and supervision, that all become 'bureaucrats' for a time, and that no 
one therefore can become a 'bureaucrat' ".</p>

<p class="fst">This was part of the libertarian rhetoric of the Bolshevism of 
1917. But Lenin, as usual, had his feet firmly on the ground. He spelled out 
what this would mean in practice. The development of capitalism created the 
"economic prerequisites" which made it "quite possible, immediately, overnight 
after the overthrow of the capitalists and the bureaucrats, to supersede them in 
the control of production and distribution, in the work of keeping account of 
labour and its products by the armed workers, by the whole of the armed 
population":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The accountancy and control necessary for this have been so 
utterly simplified by capitalism that they have become the extraordinarily 
simple operations of checking, recording and issuing receipts, which anyone who 
can read and write and who knows the first four rules of arithmetic can 
perform."<a href="#n77" name="fn77" target="_self">[77]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There is no mention of who will initiate the decisions which the 
masses will then "check" and "record". <i>State and Revolution</i> includes the 
interesting phrase: "We want the socialist revolution with human nature as it is 
now, with human nature that cannot dispense with subordination, control and 
managers".<a href="#n78" name="fn78" target="_self">[78]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The year 1917 certainly saw a tremendous social upheaval. But it 
was a Utopian dream to assume that socialism could be achieved without a large 
proportion of the population both understanding and wanting it The building of 
socialism (unlike the development of capitalism, which can safely be left to 
market forces) can only be the <i>self-conscious and collective act of the 
immense majority</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="h40">December</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Publication, by the Central Council of the Petrograd Factory 
Committees, of the famous <b> <i>Practical Manual for the Implementation of 
Workers' Control of Industry</i></b>. To the intense annoyance of Party members 
this was widely distributed in the suburbs of Petrograd.</p>

<p class="fst">The main value of this pamphlet is that it deals with how 
"workers' control" could rapidly be extended into "workers' management". Neither 
in Lenin's view - nor in that of the authors (despite the title) - was there any 
confusion between "control" and "management". Lenin was advocating "workers' 
control" and his whole practice, after the revolution, was to denounce attempts 
at workers' management as "premature", "utopian", "anarchist", "harmful", 
"intolerable", etc. It would be tragic if the ahistoricism and anti-theoretical 
bias of much of the libertarian movement today allowed new militants to fall 
into old traps or compelled them again to take turnings that at best lead 
nowhere - or at worst on to the grounds of previous defeats.</p>

<p class="fst">The <i>Manual</i> made a number of concrete suggestions to the 
Factory Committees. Each Committee should set up four control commissions, 
"entitled to invite the attendance of technicians and others in a consultative 
capacity" (so much for the widely peddled lie that the Factory Committees were 
not prepared to associate the technicians or specialists in their work).</p>

<p class="fst">The functions of the four commissions were to be: (a) the 
organization of production; (b) the reconversion from war production; (c) the 
supply of raw materials; and (d) the supply of fuel. The proposals are developed 
in considerable detail. It is stressed throughout that "workers' control" is <i>
not</i> just a question of taking stock of the supplies of raw materials and 
fuel (cf. Lenin's "Socialism is stocktaking; every time you take stock of iron 
bars or of pieces of cloth, that is socialism"),<a href="#n79" name="fn79" target="_self">[79]</a> 
but that it is intimately related to the transformation of these raw materials 
within the factory - in other words with the totality of the work processes 
culminating in a finished product.</p>

<p class="fst">The "production commission" should be entrusted with the task of 
establishing the necessary links between the different sections of the factory, 
of supervising the state of the machinery, of advising on and overcoming various 
deficiencies in the arrangement of the factory or plant, <i>of determining the 
coefficients of exploitation</i> in each section, of deciding on the optimum 
number of shops, and of workers in each shop, of investigating the depreciation 
of machines and of buildings, of determining job allocations (from the post of 
administrator down) and of taking charge of the financial relations of the 
factory.</p>

<p class="fst">The authors of the <i>Manual</i> announce that they intend to 
group the Factory Committees into Regional Federations and these in turn into an 
All-Russian Federation. And to be sure there was no misunderstanding they 
stressed that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"workers' control of industry, as a part of workers' control 
of the totality of economic life, must not be seen in the narrow sense of a 
reform of institutions but in the widest possible sense: that of moving into 
fields previously dominated by others. Control should merge into management."</p>

<p class="fst">In practice the implementation of workers' control took on a 
variety of forms, in different parts of Russia. These were partly determined by 
local conditions but primarily by the degree of resistance shown by different 
sections of the employing class. In some places the employers were expropriated 
forthwith, "from below". In other instances they were merely submitted to a 
supervisory type of "control", exercised by the Factory Committees. There was no 
predetermined model to follow. The various practices and experiments were at 
first the subject of heated discussions. These were not a waste of time, as was 
later to be alleged. They should be seen as essential by all who accepted that 
the advance towards socialism can only come about through the <i>
self-emancipation</i> of the working class. The discussions unfortunately were 
soon to be drawn to a close.</p>

<h4><a name="h41">December 13</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><i>Isvestiya</i> publishes the <b> <i>General Instructions on 
Workers' Control in Conformity with the Decree of November 14</i></b>. These 
became known as the <b> <i>Counter-Manual</i></b> and represent the finished 
expression of the Leninist point of view.<a href="#r7" name="rn7" target="_self">[7*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The first four sections deal with the organization of workers' 
control in the factories and with the election of control commissions. The next 
five sections decree the duties and rights of these commissions, stressing which 
functions they should undertake and which should remain the prerogative of the 
owner-managers. <i>Section 5</i> stresses that insofar as the commissions play 
any real role in the management of enterprises, this role should be confined to 
supervising the carrying out of directives issued by those Central Government 
agencies "specifically entrusted with the regulation of economic activity on a 
national scale". <i>Section 7</i> states that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the right to issue orders relating to the management, running 
and functioning of enterprises remains in the hands of the owner. The control 
commissions must <i>not</i> participate in the management of enterprises and 
have no responsibilities in relation to their functioning. This responsibility 
also remains vested in the hands of the owner."</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Section 8</i> specifies that the commissions should not 
concern themselves with matters relating to finance, all such matters being the 
prerogative of the Central Governmental Institutions. <i>Section 9</i> 
specifically forbids the commissions from expropriating and managing 
enterprises. They are however entitled to "raise the question of taking over 
enterprises with the Government, through the medium of the higher organs of 
workers' control". <i>Section 14</i> finally puts down on paper what had been in 
the minds of the Bolshevik leaders for several weeks. Even at a local level the 
Factory Committees were to be made to merge with the union apparatus:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The control commissions in each factory were to constitute 
the executive organs of the 'control of distribution section' of the local 
trade-union federation. The activities of the control commissions should be made 
to conform with the decisions of the latter."</p>

<p class="fst">The fact that these "general instructions" were issued within a 
fortnight of the setting up of the Vesenka clearly shows the systematic lines 
along which Lenin and his collaborators were thinking. They may have been 
"right" or they may have been "wrong". (This depends on one's ideas of the kind 
of society they were trying to bring about.) But it is ridiculous to claim - as 
so many do today - that in 1917 the Bolsheviks really stood for the full, total 
and direct control by working people of the factories, mines, building sites or 
other enterprises in which they worked, i.e. that they stood for workers' 
self-management.</p>

<h4><a name="h42">December 20</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The official trade-union journal <i>Professional'ny Vestnik</i> 
(Trade-Union Herald) published a "Resolution Concerning the Trade Unions and the 
Political Parties". "Without turning into independent organs of political 
struggle, into independent political parties or appendages to them, the trade 
unions cannot remain indifferent to the problems advanced by the political 
struggle of the proletariat". After these banal generalities the resolution came 
down to earth. "Joining their destiny organizationally with some political 
party, the trade unions, as fighting class organizations of the proletariat, 
must support the political slogans and tactics of that proletarian party, which 
at the given moment approaches more closely than others the solution of the 
historical tasks, etc. etc..."</p>

<p class="fst">The same issue of the paper carried an article by the Bolshevik 
Lozovsky protesting against the Bolshevik policy of suppressing by violence 
workers' strikes against the new government. "The tasks of the trade unions and 
of the Soviet power is the isolation of the bourgeois elements who lead strikes 
and sabotage, but this isolation should not be achieved merely by mechanical 
means, by arrests, by shipping to the front or by deprivation of bread cards":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Preliminary censorship, the destruction of newspapers, the 
annihilation of freedom of agitation for the socialist and democratic parties is 
for us absolutely inadmissible. The closing of the newspapers, violence against 
strikers, etc., irritated open wounds. There has been too much of this type of 
'action' recently in the memory of the Russian toiling masses and this can lead 
to an analogy deadly to the Soviet power."</p>

<p class="fst">That a leading Party member should have to speak in this manner 
is a telling indictment of how widespread these practices must have been. This 
was increasingly the method by which the Party was seeking to settle its 
differences not only with its bourgeois opponents but with its more articulate 
opponents within the working-class movement itself. Withdrawal of bread cards 
deprived those subject to it of the legal right to rations, i.e. of the right to 
eat. Individuals deprived of their cards would be forced to obtain food on the 
black market or by other illegal means. Their "crimes against the State" would 
then be used as legal means of "neutralizing" them.</p>

<p class="fst">It was in this atmosphere concerning Party, unions and non-Party 
masses (euphemistically described as "bourgeois elements") that the big debate 
of January 1918 was to take place.</p>

<h4><a name="h43">December 23</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Decree setting up a network of Regional Councils of National 
Economy (Sovnarkhozy) under the supervision of the Vesenka:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Each regional Sovnarkhoz was [to be] a replica in miniature 
of Vesenka at the Centre. It was to be divided into fourteen sections for 
different branches of production and was to contain representatives of local 
institutions and organizations..."</p>

<p class="fst">Each Sovnarkhoz could set up "smaller units incorporating the 
corresponding organs of workers control where the latter had come into being". 
"What had been created was a central economic department with local offices".<a href="#n80" name="fn80" target="_self">[80]</a></p>

<h3><a name="h45">Remarks:</a></h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="r1" href="#rn1">[1*]</a> On February 14, 1918, 
Russia abandoned the old Julian calendar and adopted the Gregorian one in use in 
Western Europe. February 1 became February 14. Old style dates have been 
observed up to this point. New style dates thereafter.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r2" href="#rn2">[2*]</a> Anna Mikhailovna 
Pankratova joined the Bolshevik Party in 1919 as an Odessa University student. 
She wrote a number of books on the history of the Russian labour movement and 
later became a professor at Moscow University and at the Academy of Social 
Sciences. In 1952 she was elected to the Central Committee of the Party and the 
following year became editor-in-chief of the Party journal, <i>Voprosii Istorii</i> 
(Questions of History). She died in 1957.</p>

<p class="endnote">Published before the era of systematic historical distortion, 
her pamphlet on the Factory Committees contains interesting material. Her scope 
and vision are however seriously limited because of her endorsement of two 
fundamental Bolshevik assumptions: (a) "that the role of the Factory Committees 
ends either with the ebb of the revolutionary tide or with the victory of the 
Revolution" and (b) that the "demands and aspirations arising from the depths of 
the working class are given formulation, and provided with ideological content 
and organizational cement through the Party...The struggle for workers' 
control took place under the leadership of the Party, which had allowed [<i>sic</i>!] 
the proletariat to take political and economic power".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r3" href="#rn3">[3*]</a> We are not here 
"denouncing" the fact that the unions were being influenced by political 
parties. Nor are we advocating anything as simplistic as "keeping politics out 
of the unions". We are simply describing the real state of affairs in Russia in 
1917, with a view to assessing its significance in the subsequent development of 
the Russian Revolution.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r4" href="#rn4">[4*]</a> It is quite dishonest for 
those who should know better (see article by T. Cliff in <i>Labour Worker</i> of 
November 1967) to trumpet these decrees on workers' control as something they 
never were - and were never intended to become.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r5" href="#rn5">[5*]</a> Unlike so many anarchists 
of today, most anarchists at the time were also well aware of the difference. Voline (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 77) says: "the anarchists rejected the vague, 
nebulous slogan of 'control of production'. They advocated expropriation - 
progressive but immediate - of private industry by the organizations of 
collective production".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r6" href="#rn6">[6*]</a> It is not a question of 
counterpoising, as various anarchists do, "the movement of the masses" to 
"dictatorship by the state" but of understanding the specific form of the new 
authority relations which arose at that particular point of history.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r7" href="#rn7">[7*]</a> Both the <i>Manual</i> 
and the <i>Counter-Manual</i> should be translated into English. An idea of 
their contents can be obtained from Limon, <i>op. cit.</i>, although the article 
degenerates in places into sophisticated Leninist apologetics.</p>
