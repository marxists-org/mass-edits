<h2><a name="h1">1919</a></h2>

<h4><a name="h2">January 16-25</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Second All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions.</b></p>

<p class="fst">Throughout 1918 the trade unions had played an important role in 
industrial administration. This had vastly increased when the government, afraid 
that privately-owned industry wouldn't work for the needs of the Red Army, 
speeded up the nationalization programme, "at first as a matter of military 
rather than of economic policy".<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
What Lenin called the "state functions" of the unions had increased rapidly. 
Party members in the trade-union leadership (such as Tomsky, Chairman of the 
All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions) enjoyed considerable power.</p>

<p class="fst">The relation between the union leaderships and the rank and file 
were far from democratic however. "In practice the more the trade unions assumed 
the administrative functions of a conventional managerial bureaucracy, the more 
bureaucratic they themselves became".<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
A Congress delegate, Chirkin, claimed for instance that "although in most 
regions there were institutions representing the trade union movement, these 
institutions were not elected or ratified in any way; where elections had been 
conducted and individuals elected who were not suitable to the needs of the 
Central Council or local powers, the elections had been annulled very freely and 
the individuals replaced by others more subservient to the administration".<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> 
Another delegate, Perkin, spoke out against new regulations which required that 
representatives sent by workers' organizations to the Commissariat of Labour be 
ratified by the Commissariat:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"If at a union meeting we elect a person as a commissar - i.e. 
if the working class is allowed in a given case to express its will - one would 
think that this individual would be allowed to represent our interests in the 
Commissariat, would be our commissar. But, no. In spite of the fact that we have 
expressed our will - the will of the working class - it is still necessary for 
the commissar we have elected to be confirmed by the authorities...The 
proletariat is allowed the right to make a fool of itself. It is allowed to 
elect representatives but the state power, through its right to ratify the 
elections or not, treats our representatives as it pleases".<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The unions - and all other bodies for that matter - were 
increasingly coming under the control of the state, itself already in the 
exclusive hands of the Party and its nominees. But although there had already 
been a very definite shift of power in the direction of the emerging 
bureaucracy, working class organization and consciousness were still strong 
enough to exact at least verbal concessions from Party and union leaders. The 
autonomous Factory Committees had by now been completely smashed but the workers 
were still fighting a rearguard action in the unions themselves. They were 
seeking to preserve a few residual shreds of their erstwhile power.</p>

<p class="fst">The Second Trade Union Congress "sanctioned the arrangements 
under which the unions had become at once military recruiting agents, supply 
services, punitive organs, and so on".<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> Tomsky for instance pointed out:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"that at a time when the trade unions determined wages and 
conditions of work, strikes could no longer be tolerated. It was necessary to 
put dots on the i's".</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin spoke about the "inevitable stratification of the trade 
unions". (The pill was coated with talk about the function of the unions being 
to educate the workers in the art of administration and about the eventual 
"withering away" of the state.) Lozovsky, who had left the Party, spoke as an 
independent internationalist against Bolshevik policy in the unions.</p>

<p class="fst">A resolution was passed demanding that "official status be 
granted to the administrative prerogatives of the unions". It spoke of 
"statization" (<i>ogosudarstvlenie</i>) of the trade unions, "as their function 
broadened and merged with the governmental machinery of industrial 
administration and control".<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> 
The Commissar for Labour, V. V. Shmidt, accepted that "even the organs of the 
Commissariat of Labour should be built out of the trade union apparatus".<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> 
(At this stage the membership of the unions stood at 3,500,000. It had been 
2,600,000 at the time of the First Trade Union Congress, in January 1918, and 
1,500,000 at the July Conference of 1917.)<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Second Congress finally set up an Executive vested with 
supreme authority between Congresses. The decrees of this Executive were 
declared "compulsory for all the unions within its jurisdiction <i>and for each 
member of those unions</i>":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The violation of the decrees and insubordination to them on 
the part of individual unions will lead to their expulsion from the family of 
proletarian unions".<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This would of course place the union outside the only legal 
framework in which the Bolshevik regime would permit unions to exist at all.</p>

<h4><a name="h3">March 2-7</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>First Congress of Comintern (Third International).</b></p>

<h4><a name="h4">March 18-23</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Eighth Party Congress.</b></p>

<p class="fst">The Ukraine and Volga regions had now been reoccupied by the Red 
Army. A short period of relative stability followed. Later in the year, the 
advances of Denikin and Yudenich were to threaten Moscow and Petrograd 
respectively.</p>

<p class="fst">A wave of left criticism surged up at the Eighth Congress against 
the ultra-centralist trends. A new Party programme was discussed and accepted. 
Point 5 of the "Economic Section" stated that</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the organizational apparatus of socialized industry must be 
based primarily on the trade unions...Participating already in accordance with 
the laws of the Soviet Republic and established practice in all local and 
central organs of industrial administration, the trade unions must proceed to 
the actual concentration <i>in their own hands</i> [my emphasis] of all 
the administration of the entire economy, as a single economic unit...The 
participation of the trade unions in economic management and their drawing the 
broad masses into this work constitutes also the chief method of struggle 
against the bureaucratization of the economic apparatus".<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This famous paragraph was to give rise to heated controversies in 
the years to come. The conservatives in the Party felt it was going too far. 
Ryazanov warned the Congress that "we will not avoid bureaucratization until all 
trade unions...relinquish <i>every</i> right in the administration of 
production".<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> On the other 
hand those Bolsheviks who had voted for the incorporation of the Factory 
Committees into the structure of the unions - and belatedly seen the error of 
their ways - were to hang on to this clause as to a last bastion, seeking to 
defend it against the all-pervasive encroachments of the Party bureaucracy. Deutscher describes the famous Point 5 as "a 'syndicalist' slip committed by the 
Bolshevik leadership in a mood of genuine gratitude to the trade unions for the 
work performed by them in the Civil War".<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> He describes how Lenin and the other 
Bolshevik leaders "would soon have to do a lot of explaining away in order to 
invalidate this promissory note which the Party had so solemnly and 
authoritatively handed to the trade unions". The interpretation is questionable. 
Lenin was not in the habit of making "slips" (syndicalist or otherwise) or of 
being influenced by such considerations as "gratitude". It is more probable that 
the relation of forces, revealed at the Congress - itself only a pale reflection 
of working-class attitudes outside the Party - compelled the Bolshevik 
leadership to beat a verbal retreat. The clause was anyway surrounded by a 
number of others, partly invalidating it.</p>

<p class="fst">The programme proclaimed that "the socialist method of production 
could only be made secure on the basis of the comradely discipline of the 
workers". It assigned to the trade unions "the chief role in creating this new 
socialist discipline". Point 8</p>

<p class="quoteb">"urged the unions to impress upon the workers the need to work 
with and learn from the bourgeois technicians and specialists - and to overcome 
their 'ultra-radical' distrust of the latter...The workers could not build 
socialism without a period of apprenticeship to the bourgeois 
intelligentsia...Payment of high salaries and premiums to bourgeois specialists was therefore 
sanctioned. It was the ransom which the young proletarian State had to pay the 
bourgeois-bred technicians and scientists for services with which it could not 
dispense".<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">We cannot here become involved in a full discussion on the role 
of "specialists" after the revolution. The problem is not an exclusively Russian 
one, although the specific conditions of Russian development doubtless resulted 
in a particularly marked divorce between technicians and industrial workers. 
Specialized knowledge of a technical nature will clearly be required by the 
Workers' Councils but there is no reason why those who now possess it should all 
find themselves on the side of the bourgeoisie. This knowledge does not of 
itself, however, entitle anyone either to impose decisions or to enjoy material 
benefits.</p>

<p class="fst">These problems have been exhaustively discussed in a number of 
publications - but nearly always in terms of either crude expediency or of 
immutable "basic principles". The theoretical implications have only recently 
been explored. According to Limon management is partly a technical question.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> 
But the historical circumstances in which the working class will be compelled to 
undertake it will make it appear to them as primarily a political and social 
task. At the everyday, down-to-earth and <i>human</i> level the workers at the 
time of the socialist revolution will almost inevitably see the technicians and 
specialists not as human beings (who also happen to have technological know-how) 
but exclusively as the agents of the exploitation of man by man.</p>

<p class="fst">The capitalist world is one of fetishism, where <i>interpersonal</i> 
relationships tend to disappear behind relationships between <i>things</i>. But 
the very moment when the masses revolt against this state of affairs, they break 
through this smoke screen. They see through the taboo of "things" and come to 
grips with <i>people</i>, whom they had "respected" until then in the name of 
the all-holy fetish known as private property. From that moment on the 
specialist, manager or capitalist, whatever his technical or personal 
relationship to the enterprise, appears to the workers as the incarnation of 
exploitation, as the enemy, as the one with whom the only thing they want to do 
is to get him out of their lives. To ask the workers, <i>at this stage</i>, to 
have a more "balanced" attitude, to recognize in the old boss the new "technical 
director", the "indispensable specialist", is tantamount to asking the workers - 
at the very moment when they are becoming aware of their historical role and of 
their social power, at the very moment when at last confident in themselves they 
are asserting their autonomy - to confess their incompetence, their weakness, 
their insufficiency, and this in the area where they are most sensitive, the 
field encompassing their daily lives from childhood on: the field of production.</p>

<p class="fst">The bureaucratization of the Party itself provoked pointed 
comments at the Congress. Osinsky declared: "It is necessary to enrol workers 
into the Central Committee on a broad scale; it is necessary to introduce there 
a sufficient quantity of workers in order to proletarianize the Central 
Committee".<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> (Lenin was to 
come to the same conclusion in 1923, at the time of the so-called Lenin Levy!) Osinsky proposed that the Central Committee be expanded from 15 to 21 members. 
It was extremely naive, however, to expect that this introduction of 
proletarians into the higher echelons of the administrative machine could 
somewhat compensate for the fact that the working class had by now almost 
totally lost the power it had briefly held <i>at the point of production</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The decline in the Soviets was also discussed at the Congress. 
The Soviets were no longer playing any active role in relation to production - 
and very little role in other matters either. More and more of the decisions 
were being taken by the Party members serving in the "Soviet apparatus". The 
Soviets had become mere organs of ratification (rubber stamps). The theses of 
Sapronov and Osinsky - according to which the Party should not seek to "impose 
its will on the Soviets" - were decisively rejected.</p>

<p class="fst">The Party leaders made minor concessions on all of these issues. 
But the process of tightening up control, both in the Party and in the economy 
as a whole, continued at an unrelenting pace. The Eighth Congress established 
the Politbureau, the Orgbureau and the Secretariat, technically only 
sub-committees of the Central Committee, but soon to assume tremendous power. 
The concentration of decision-making authority had taken a big step forward. 
"Party discipline" was strengthened. The Congress ruled that each decision must 
above all be fulfilled. Only after this is an appeal to the corresponding Party 
organ permissible:<a href="#r1" name="rn1" target="_self">[1*]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">"...The whole matter of posting of Party workers is in the 
hands of the Central Committee. Its decisions are binding for everyone".<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The era of political postings - as a means of silencing 
embarrassing criticism - had begun in earnest.</p>

<h4><a name="h5">April</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Highpoint of Kolchak's offensive in Urals.</p>

<h4><a name="h6">June</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Decree introducing "labour books" for workers in Moscow and 
Petrograd.</p>

<h4><a name="h7">October</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Highpoint of Denikin's offensive in South Russia. Yudenich's 
drive on Petrograd.</p>

<h4><a name="h8">December 2-4</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Eighth Party Conference.</b></p>

<p class="fst">The Eighth Conference worked out a statute which rigidly defined 
the rights and duties of Party cells (fractions or <i>fraktsya</i>) and 
elaborated a scheme calculated to secure for the Party a leading role in every 
organization. "The Communist trade unionist was thus a Communist first and only 
then a trade unionist, and by his disciplined behaviour he enabled the Party to 
lead the trade unions."<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> As 
the Party degenerated this "leadership" was to play an increasingly pernicious 
role.</p>

<h4><a name="h9">December 5-9</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Seventh All-Russian Congress of Soviets.</b> (There had been 
two such Congresses in 1917 and four in 1918). Resolution passed in favour of 
collective management of industry.<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> 
At the congress, Sapronov attacked the unpopular <i>
glavki</i>, arguing that they represented an attempt to substitute "organization 
by departments for organization by Soviets, the bureaucratic for the democratic 
system". Another speaker declared that if people were asked "what should be 
destroyed on the day after the destruction of Denikin and Kolchak, 90 per cent 
would reply: the <i>glavki</i> and the centres".<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h10">December 16</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Trotsky submits to Central Committee of the Party his "<b>Theses 
on the Transition from War to Peace</b>" (dealing in particular with the "<i>militarization 
of labour</i>"), intending them, for the time being to go no further.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> 
The most fundamental decisions, affecting the material conditions of life of 
millions of ordinary Russian workers, had first to be discussed and decided 
behind closed doors, by the Party leaders. The following day, <i>Pravda</i>, 
under the editorship of Bukharin, published Trotsky's theses "by mistake" (in 
reality as part of a campaign to discredit Trotsky). For those who can see 
deeper than the surface of things, the whole episode was highly symptomatic of 
the tensions within the Party at the time.</p>

<p class="fst">At this stage Lenin wholeheartedly supported Trotsky's proposals. 
(A whole mythology was later to be built up by Trotskyists and others to the 
effect that "Trotsky may have been wrong on the militarization of labour" but 
that Lenin was always opposed to it. This is untrue. <i>Lenin was only to oppose 
Trotsky on this question twelve months later</i>, <i>at the end of 1920</i>, as 
will be described shortly.)</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky's proposals let loose "an avalanche of protests".<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> 
He was shouted down at Conferences of Party members, administrators and trade 
unionists.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> A comment is 
perhaps called for at this stage concerning the attitude of revolutionaries 
towards "drastic measures" needed for the salvation of the Revolution. 
Throughout history the masses have always been prepared to make enormous 
sacrifices whenever they felt really fundamental issues were at stake. The real 
problem is not, however, to discuss whether this or that suggestion was "too 
drastic" or not. The problem is to know from whom the decision emanated. Was it 
taken by institutions controlled from below? Or was it taken by some 
self-appointed and self-perpetuating organism divorced from the masses? Party 
members opposing the measures being proposed at this stage were caught in an 
insoluble contradiction. They denounced the <i>policies</i> of the Party leaders 
without really understanding the extent to which their own organizational 
conceptions had contributed to what was happening to the Revolution. Only some 
members of the Workers' Opposition of 1921 (to a slight degree) and Myasnikov's 
Workers' Group of 1922 (to a greater extent) began to sense the new reality.</p>

<h4><a name="h11">December 27</a></h4>

<p class="fst">With Lenin's approval the government sets up the Commission on 
Labour Duty, with Trotsky (still Commissar for War) as its President.</p>

<h3><a name="h12">Remarks:</a></h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="r1" href="#rn1">[1*]</a> A pathetic echo, 
nearly fifty years later, is to be found in the "Perspectives for I.S.", 
submitted in September 1968 by the Political Committee of <i>International 
Socialism</i>. Point 4 ran: "Branches must accept directives from the Centre, 
unless they fundamentally disagree with them, in which case they should try to 
accord with them, while demanding an open debate on the matter".</p>
