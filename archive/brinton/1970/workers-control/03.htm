<h2><a name="h1">1918</a></h2>

<h4><a name="h2">January 6</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Dissolution of Constituent Assembly.</b> The detachment which 
dispersed the Assembly was led by an anarchist Kronstadt sailor, Zheleznyakov, 
now commandant of the Tauride Palace Guard. He unseated the Chairman of the 
Assembly, Victor Chernov, with the blunt announcement: "The guard is tired".<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h3">January 7-14</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>First All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions</b> held in 
Petrograd.</p>

<p class="fst">Two main themes were to dominate the Congress. What were to be 
the relations between the Factory Committees and the unions? And what were to be 
the relations between the trade unions and the new Russian state? Few delegates, 
at this stage, sensed the close relationship between these two questions. Still 
fewer perceived how a simultaneous resolution of the first question in favour of 
the unions and of the second in favour of the new "workers' state" would soon 
emasculate the Committees and in fact irrevocably undermine the proletarian 
nature of the regime.</p>

<p class="fst">The arguments at this Congress reflected matters of deep 
significance and will be referred to in some detail. In the balance lay the 
future of the Russian working class for many decades to come.</p>

<p class="fst">According to Lozovsky (a Bolshevik trade unionist), "the Factory 
Committees were so much the owners and masters that three months after the 
Revolution they were to a significant degree independent of the general 
controlling organs".<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> Maisky, then still a Menshevik, said that in his experience "it was not just 
some of the proletariat but most of the proletariat, especially in Petrograd, 
who looked upon workers' control as if it were actually the emergence of the 
kingdom (<i>tsarstvo</i>) of socialism". He lamented that among the workers "the 
very idea of socialism is embodied in the concept of workers' control".<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> 
Another Menshevik delegate deplored the fact that "an anarchist wave in the 
shape of Factory Committees and workers' control was sweeping over our Russian 
labour movement".<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> D. B. Ryazanov,<a href="#r1" name="rn1" target="_self">[1*]</a> a recent convert 
to Bolshevism, agreed with the Mensheviks on this point and urged the Factory 
Committees "to commit suicide by becoming an integral element of the trade-union 
structure".<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The few anarcho-syndicalist delegates to the Congress "fought a 
desperate battle to preserve the autonomy of the Committees...Maximov<a href="#r2" name="rn2" target="_self">[2*]</a> 
claimed that he and his fellow anarcho-syndicalists were 'better Marxists' than 
either the Mensheviks or the Bolsheviks - a declaration which caused a great 
stir in the hall".<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> He was 
alluding no doubt to Marx's statement that the liberation of the working class 
had to be brought about by the workers themselves.<a href="#r3" name="rn3" target="_self">[3*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Maximov urged the delegates to remember "that the Factory 
Committees, organizations introduced directly by life itself in the course of 
the Revolution, were the closest of all to the working class, much closer than 
the trade unions".<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> The 
function of the Committees was no longer to protect and improve the conditions 
of the workers. They had to seek a predominant position in industry and in the 
economy. "As the offspring of the Revolution the Committees would create a new 
production on a new basis".<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> 
The unions "which corresponded to the old economic relations of Tsarist times 
had lived out their time and couldn't take on this task".<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> Maximov anticipated "a great conflict between state power in the centre and the 
organizations composed exclusively of workers which are found in the 
localities":<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">"The aim of the proletariat was to co-ordinate all activity, 
all local interest, to create a centre but not a centre of decrees and 
ordinances but a centre of regulation, of guidance - and only through such a 
centre to organize the industrial life of the country."<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Speaking on behalf of the Factory Committees a rank-and-file 
worker, Belusov, made a scathing attack on the Party leaders. They continually 
criticized the Committees "for not acting according to rules and regulations" 
but then failed to produce any coherent plan of their own. They just talked:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"All this will freeze local work. Are we to stand still 
locally, wait and do nothing? Only then will we make no mistakes. Only those who 
do nothing make no mistakes."</p>

<p class="fst">Real workers' control was the solution to Russia's economic 
disintegration. "The only way out remaining to the workers is to take the 
factories into their own hands and manage them".<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Excitement in the Congress reached a climax when Bill Shatov<a href="#r4" name="rn4" target="_self">[4*]</a> 
characterized the trade unions as "living corpses" and urged the working class 
"to organize in the localities and create a free, new Russia, without a God, 
without a Tsar, and without a boss in the trade union". When Ryazanov protested 
Shatov's vilification of the unions, Maximov rose to his comrade's defence, 
dismissing Ryazanov's objections as those of a white-handed intellectual who had 
never worked, never sweated, never felt life. Another anarcho-syndicalist 
delegate, Laptev by name, reminded the gathering that the revolution had been 
made "not only by the intellectuals, but by the masses"; therefore it was 
imperative for Russia to "listen to the voice of the working masses, the voice 
from below".<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The anarcho-syndicalist resolution calling for "real workers' 
control, not state workers' control", and urging "that the organization of 
production, transport and distribution be immediately transferred to the hands 
of the toiling people themselves and not to the state or some civil service 
machine made up of one kind or other of class enemy" was defeated. (The main 
strength of the anarcho-syndicalists was among the miners of the Debaltzev 
district in the Don Basin, among the portworkers and cement workers of 
Ekaterinodar and Novorossiysk and among the Moscow railway workers. At the 
Congress they had 25 delegates (on the basis of one delegate per 3,000-3,500 
members).<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The new government would have none of all this talk about 
extending the power of the Committees. It clearly recognized in the unions a 
"more stable" and "less anarchic" force (i.e. a force more amenable to control 
from above) in which it could provisionally vest administrative functions in 
industry. The Bolsheviks therefore urged "the trade-union organizations, as 
class organizations of the proletariat constructed according to the industrial 
principle, to take upon themselves the main task of organizing production and of 
restoring the weakened productive forces of the country".<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> 
(At a later stage the Bolsheviks were to fight tooth and nail to divest the 
unions of these very functions and place them firmly in the hands of Party 
nominees. In fact the Party demands of January 1918 were again and again to be 
thrown back in the face of the Bolshevik leaders during the next three years. 
This will be dealt with further on.)</p>

<p class="fst">The Congress, with its overwhelming Bolshevik majority, voted to 
transform the Factory Committees into union organs.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> 
The Menshevik and Social Revolutionary delegates voted <i>with</i> the 
Bolsheviks for a resolution proclaiming that "the centralization of workers' 
control was the task of the trade unions".<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> 
"Workers' control" was defined as "the instrument by which the universal 
economic plan must be put into effect locally".<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> 
"It implied the definite idea of standardization in the sphere of production".<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> 
It was too bad if the workers read more into the term than this. "Just because 
the workers misunderstand and falsely interpret workers' control is no reason to 
repudiate it".<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> What the 
Party meant by workers' control was spelt out in some detail. It meant, <i>inter 
alia</i>, that</p>

<p class="quoteb">"it was not within the competence of the lower organs of 
workers' control to be entrusted with financial control function...this should 
rest with the highest organs of control, with the general apparatus of 
management, with the Supreme Council of National Economy. In the sphere of 
finance everything must be left to the higher organs of workers' control.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">For workers' control to be of maximum use to the proletariat 
it was absolutely necessary to refrain from atomizing it. Workers of individual 
enterprises should not be left the right to make final decisions on questions 
touching upon the existence of the enterprise."<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A lot of re-education was needed and this was to be entrusted to 
the "economic control commissions" of the unions. They were to inculcate into 
the ranks of the workers the Bolshevik conception of workers' control:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The trade unions must go over each decree of the Factory 
Committees in the sphere of control, explain through their delegates at the 
factories and shops that control over production does not mean the transfer of 
the enterprise into the hands of the workers of a given enterprise, that it does 
not equal the socialization of production and exchange."<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Once the Committees had been "devoured" the unions were to be the 
intermediate agency through which workers' control was gradually to be converted 
into state control.</p>

<p class="fst">These were not abstract discussions. Underlying the 
controversies, what was at stake was the whole concept of socialism: workers' 
power or the power of the Party acting on behalf of the working class. "If 
workers succeeded in maintaining their ownership of the factories they had 
seized, if they ran these factories for themselves, if they considered the 
revolution to be at an end, if they considered socialism to have been 
established - then there would have been no need for the revolutionary 
leadership of the Bolsheviks."<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The bitterness with which the issue of the Factory Committees was 
discussed highlights another point:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Although the Bolsheviks were in a majority at the first 
All-Russian Conference of Factory Committees - and although as representatives 
of the Factory Committees they could force resolutions through this Conference 
they could not enforce resolutions against the opposition of the Factory 
Committees themselves...The Factory Committees accepted Bolshevik leadership 
only so long as divergences in goals were not brought to the test".<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The First Trade Union Congress also witnessed a heated 
controversy on the question of the relation of the trade unions to the state. 
The Mensheviks claiming that the Revolution could only usher in a 
bourgeois-democratic republic, insisted on the autonomy of the unions in 
relation to the new Russian state. As Maisky put it: "If capitalism remains 
intact, the tasks with which trade unions are confronted under capitalism remain 
unaltered".<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> Others too felt 
that capitalism would reassert itself and that the unions should do nothing that 
would impair their power. Martov put a more sophisticated viewpoint. "In this 
historic situation", he said</p>

<p class="quoteb">"this government cannot represent the working class alone. It 
cannot but be a <i>de facto</i> administration connected with a heterogeneous 
mass of toiling people, with proletarian and non-proletarian elements alike. It 
cannot therefore conduct its <i>economic</i> policy along the lines of 
consistently and clearly expressed working class interests".<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The trade unions could. Therefore the trade unions should retain 
a certain independence in relation to the new state. It is interesting that in 
his 1921 controversy with Trotsky - when incidentally it was far too late - 
Lenin was to use much the same kind of argument. He was to stress the need for 
the workers to defend themselves against "their own" state, defined as not just 
a "workers' state, but a workers' and peasants' state" and more over one with 
"bureaucratic deformations".</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolshevik viewpoint, supported by Lenin and Trotsky and 
voiced by Zinoviev, was that the trade unions should be subordinated to the 
government, although not assimilated with it. Trade-union neutrality was 
officially labelled a "bourgeois" idea, an anomaly in a workers' state.<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a> 
The resolution adopted by the Congress clearly expressed these dominant ideas:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The trade unions ought to shoulder the main burden of 
organizing production and of rehabilitating the country's shattered economic 
forces. Their most urgent tasks consist in their energetic participation in all 
central bodies called upon to regulate output, in the organization of workers' 
control [<i>sic</i>!], in the registration and distribution of the labour force, 
in the organization of exchange between town and countryside...in the struggle 
against sabotage and in enforcing the general obligation to work..."</p>

<p class="quoteb">"As they develop the trade unions should, in the process of the 
present socialist revolution, become organs of socialist power, and as such they 
should work in co-ordination with and <i>subordination</i> to other bodies in 
order to carry into effect the new principles...The Congress is convinced that 
in consequence of the foreshadowed process, <i>the trade unions will inevitably 
become transformed into organs of the socialist state</i>. Participation in the 
trade unions will for all people employed in any industry be their duty <i>
vis-à-vis</i> the State".</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolsheviks did not unanimously accept Lenin's views on these 
questions. While Tomsky, their main spokesman on trade-union affairs, pointed 
out that "sectional interests of groups of workers had to be subordinated to the 
interests of the entire class"<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> 
- which like so many Bolsheviks he wrongly identified with the hegemony of the 
Bolshevik Party - Ryazanov argued that</p>

<p class="quoteb">"as long as the social revolution begun here has not merged 
with the social revolution of Europe and of the whole world...the Russian 
proletariat...must be on its guard and must not renounce a single one of its 
weapons...it must maintain its trade union organization".<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">According to Zinoviev, the "independence' of the trade unions 
under a workers' government could mean nothing except the right to support 
'saboteurs' ". Despite this Tsyperovich, a prominent Bolshevik trade unionist, 
proposed that the Congress ratify the right of unions to continue to resort to 
strike action in defence of their members. A resolution to this effect was 
however defeated.<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As might be expected the dominant attitude of the dominant Party 
(both in relation to the Factory Committees and in relation to the unions) was 
to play an important role in the subsequent development of events. It was to 
prove as much an "objective fact of history" as the "devastation" and the 
"atomization of the working class" caused by the (subsequent) Civil War. It 
could, in fact, be argued that Bolshevik attitudes to the Factory Committees 
(and the dashing of the great hopes that these Committees represented for 
hundreds of thousands of workers) were to engender or reinforce working-class 
apathy and cynicism, and contribute to absenteeism and to the seeking of private 
solutions to what were social problems, all of which the Bolsheviks were so 
loudly to decry. It is above all essential to stress that the Bolshevik policy 
in relation to the Committees and to the unions which we have documented in some 
detail was being put forward twelve months <i>before</i> the murder of Karl 
Liebknecht and of Rosa Luxemburg - i.e. before the irrevocable failure of the 
German Revolution, an event usually taken as "justifying" many of the measures 
taken by the Russian rulers.</p>

<h4><a name="h4">January 15-21</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>First All-Russian Congress of Textile Workers</b> held in 
Moscow. Bolsheviks in a majority. The Congress declared that "workers' control 
is only a transitional step to the planned organization of production and 
distribution".<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a> The union 
adopted new statutes proclaiming that "the lowest cell of the union is the 
Factory Committee whose obligation consists of putting into effect, in a given 
enterprise, all the decrees of the union".<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a> 
Even the big stick was waved. Addressing the Congress, Lozovsky stated that "if 
the local patriotism of individual factories conflicts with the interests of the 
whole proletariat, we unconditionally state that we will not hesitate before <i>
any measures</i> [my emphasis, MB] for the suppression of tendencies harmful to 
the toilers".<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a> The Party, in 
other words, can impose its concept of the interests of the working class, even 
against the workers themselves.</p>

<h4><a name="h5">January 23-31</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets.</b></p>

<h4><a name="h6">February</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Bolshevik decree nationalizing the land.</p>

<h4><a name="h7">March 3</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Signature of <b>Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty</b>.</p>

<p class="fst">Decree issued by Vesenka defining the functions of technical 
management in industry. Each administrative centre was to appoint to every 
enterprise under its care a <i>commissioner</i> (who would be the government 
representative and supervisor) and <i>two directors</i> (one technical and the 
other administrative). The technical director could only be overruled by the 
government commissioner or by the "Central Direction" of the industry. (In other 
words only the "administrative director" was under some kind of control from 
below.)</p>

<p class="fst">The decree laid down the principle that "in nationalized 
enterprises workers' control is exercised by submitting all declarations and 
decisions of the Factory or Shop Committee, or of the control commission, to the 
Economic Administrative Council for approval". "Not more than half the members 
of the Administrative Council should be workers or employees".<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a></p>

<p class="fst">During the early months of 1918 the Vesenka had begun to build, 
from the top, its "unified administration" of particular industries. The pattern 
was informative. During 1915 and 1916 the Tsarist government had set up central 
bodies (sometimes called "committees" and sometimes "centres") governing the 
activities of industries producing commodities directly or indirectly necessary 
for the war. By 1917 these central bodies (generally composed of representatives 
of the industry concerned and exercising regulatory functions of a rather 
undefined character) had spread over almost the whole field of industrial 
production. During the first half of 1918 Vesenka gradually took over these 
bodies (or what was left of them) and converted them - under the name of <i>
glavki</i> (chief committees) or <i>tsentry</i> (centres) into administrative 
organs subject to the direction and control of Vesenka. The "chief committee" 
for the leather industry (Glavkozh) was set up in January 1918. This was quickly 
followed by chief paper and sugar committees, and by soap and tea "centres". 
These, together with Tsentrotekstil, were all in existence by March 1918. They</p>

<p class="quoteb">"could scarcely have come into being except on foundations 
already laid before the revolution or without the collaboration of the 
managerial and technical staffs...A certain tacit community of interests could 
be detected between the government and the more sensible and moderate of the 
industrialists in bringing about a return to some kind of orderly production."<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This raised a question of considerable theoretical interest. 
Marxists have usually argued that revolutionaries could not simply seize the 
political institutions of bourgeois society (parliament, etc.) and use them for 
different purposes (i.e. for the introduction of socialism). They have always 
claimed that new political institutions (Soviets) would have to be created to 
express the reality of workers' power. But they have usually remained discreetly 
silent on the question of whether revolutionaries could "capture" the 
institutions of bourgeois economic power and use them to their own ends - or 
whether these too would have first to be smashed, and later replaced with a new 
kind of institution, representing a fundamental change in the relations of 
production. The Bolsheviks in 1918 clearly opted for the first course. Even 
within their own ranks this choice was to give rise to foreboding that all 
energies would now be directed to the "reinforcement and development of 
productive capacity, to organic construction, <i>involving a refusal to continue 
the break up of capitalist productive relations and even a partial restoration 
of them</i>".<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h8">March 6-8</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Seventh Party Congress.</b></p>

<p class="fst">Heated deliberations during this very short Congress centred on 
the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty.</p>

<h4><a name="h9">March 14-18</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Fourth All-Russian Congress of Soviets.</b></p>

<h4><a name="h10">March</a></h4>

<p class="fst">"Left" Communists (Osinsky, Bukharin, Lomov, Smirnov) ousted from 
leading positions in Supreme Economic Council - partly because of their attitude 
to Brest-Litovsk - and replaced by "moderates" like Milyutin and Rykov.<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a> 
Immediate steps taken to shore-up managerial authority, restore labour 
discipline and apply wage incentives under the supervision of the trade union 
organizations. The whole episode was a clear demonstration that "lefts" in top 
administrative positions are no substitute for rank-and-file control at the 
point of production.</p>

<h4><a name="h11">March 26</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><i>Isvestiya</i> of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee 
publishes Decree (issued by the Council of Peoples Commissars) on the 
"centralization of railway management". This decree, which ended workers' 
control on the railways was "an absolutely necessary prerequisite for the 
improvement of the conditions of the transport system".<a href="#n39" name="fn39" target="_self">[39]</a> 
It stressed the urgency of "iron labour discipline" and "individual management" 
on the railways and granted "dictatorial" powers to the Commissariat of Ways of 
Communication. Clause 6 proclaimed the need for selected individuals to act as 
"administrative technical executives" in every local, district or regional 
railway centre. These individuals were to be "responsible to the People's 
Commissars of Ways of Communication". They were to be "the embodiment of the 
whole of the dictatorial power of the proletariat in the given railway centre".<a href="#n40" name="fn40" target="_self">[40]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h12">March 30</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Trotsky, appointed Commissar of Military Affairs after 
Brest-Litovsk, had rapidly been reorganizing the Red Army. The death penalty for 
disobedience under fire had been restored. So, more gradually, had saluting, 
special forms of address, separate living quarters and other privileges for 
officers.<a href="#r5" name="rn5" target="_self">[5*]</a> Democratic forms 
of organization, including the election of officers, had been quickly dispensed 
with. "The elective basis", Trotsky wrote, "is politically pointless and 
technically inexpedient and has already been set aside by decree".<a href="#n41" name="fn41" target="_self">[41]</a> 
N. V. Krylenko, one of the Co-Commissars of Military Affairs appointed after the 
October Revolution, had resigned in disgust from the Defence Establishment as a 
result of these measures.<a href="#n42" name="fn42" target="_self">[42]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h13">April 3</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The Central Council of Trade Unions issued its first detailed 
pronouncement on the function of the trade unions in relation to "labour 
discipline" and "incentives".</p>

<p class="fst">The trade unions should "apply all their efforts to raise the 
productivity of labour and consistently to create in factories and workshops the 
indispensable foundations of labour discipline". Every union should establish a 
commission "to fix norms of productivity for every trade and category of 
workers". The use of piece rates "to raise the productivity of labour" was 
conceded. It was claimed that "bonuses for increased productivity above the 
established norm may within certain limits be a useful measure for raising 
productivity without exhausting the worker". Finally if "individual groups of 
workers" refused to submit to union discipline, they could in the last resort be 
expelled from the union "with all the consequences that flow there-from".<a href="#n43" name="fn43" target="_self">[43]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h14">April 11-12</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Armed detachments of Cheka raid 26 anarchist centres in Moscow. 
Fighting breaks out between Cheka agents and Black Guardsmen in Donskoi 
Monastery. Forty anarchists killed or wounded, over 500 taken prisoner.</p>

<h4><a name="h15">April 20</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The issue of workers' control was now being widely discussed 
within the Party. Petrograd District Committee publishes first issue of <i>
Kommunist</i> (a "left" Communist theoretical journal edited by Bukharin, Radek 
and Osinsky, later to be joined by Smirnov). This issue contained the editors' 
"Theses on the Present Situation". The paper denounced "a labour policy designed 
to implant discipline among the workers under the flag of 'self-discipline', the 
introduction of labour service for workers, piece rates, and the lengthening of 
the working day". It proclaimed that "the introduction of labour discipline in 
connection with the restoration of capitalist management of industry cannot 
really increase the productivity of labour". It would</p>

<p class="quoteb">"diminish the class initiative, activity and organization of 
the proletariat. It threatens to enslave the working class. It will arouse 
discontent among the backward elements as well as among the vanguard of the 
proletariat. In order to introduce this system in the face of the hatred 
prevailing at present among the proletariat against the 'capitalist saboteurs' 
the Communist Party would have to rely on the petty-bourgeoisie, as against the 
workers".</p>

<p class="fst">It would "ruin itself as the party of the proletariat".</p>

<p class="fst">The first issue of the new paper also contained a serious warning 
by Radek: "If the Russian Revolution were overthrown by violence on the part of 
the bourgeois counter-revolution it would rise again like a phoenix; if however 
it lost its socialist character and thereby disappointed the working masses, the 
blow would have ten times more terrible consequences for the future of the 
Russian and the international revolution".<a href="#n44" name="fn44" target="_self">[44]</a> 
The same issue warned of "bureaucratic centralization, the rule of various 
commissars, the loss of independence for local Soviets and in practice the

"It was all very well", Bukharin pointed out, "to say as Lenin had [in <i>State 
and Revolution</i>] that each cook should learn to manage the State. But what 
happened when each cook had a commissar appointed to order him about?"</p>

<p class="fst">The second issue of the paper contained some prophetic comments 
by Osinsky:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"We stand for the construction of the proletarian society by 
the class creativity of the workers themselves, not by the ukases of the 
captains of industry...if the proletariat itself does not know how to create 
the necessary prerequisites for the socialist organization of labour no one can 
do this for it and no one can compel it to do this. The stick, if raised against 
the workers, will find itself in the hands of a social force which is either 
under the influence of another social class or is in the hands of the soviet 
power; but the soviet power will then be forced to seek support against the 
proletariat from another class (e.g. the peasantry) and by this it will destroy 
itself as the dictatorship of the proletariat. Socialism and socialist 
organization will be set up by the proletariat itself, or they will not be set 
up at all: something else will be set up - state capitalism."<a href="#n46" name="fn46" target="_self">[46]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lenin reacted very sharply. The usual vituperation followed. The 
views of the "left" Communists were "a disgrace", "a complete renunciation of 
Communism in practice", "a desertion to the camp of the petty bourgeoisie".<a href="#n47" name="fn47" target="_self">[47]</a> 
The left were being "provoked by the Isuvs [Mensheviks] and other Judases of 
capitalism". A campaign was whipped up in Petrograd which compelled <i>Kommunist</i> 
to transfer publication to Moscow, where the paper reappeared first under the 
auspices of the Moscow Regional Organization of the Party, later as the 
"unofficial" mouthpiece of a group of comrades. After the appearance of the 
first issue of the paper a hastily convened Petrograd Party Conference produced 
a majority for Lenin and "demanded that the adherents of <i>Kommunist</i> cease 
their separate organizational existence".<a href="#n48" name="fn48" target="_self">[48]</a> 
So much for alleged factional rights...in 1918 (i.e. long before the Tenth 
Congress officially prohibited factions - in 1921)!</p>

<p class="fst">During the following months the Leninists succeeded in extending 
their organizational control into areas which had originally backed the "lefts". 
By the end of May the predominantly proletarian Party organization in the Ural 
region, led by Preobrazhensky, and the Moscow Regional Bureau of the Party had 
been won back by the supporters of the Party leadership. The fourth and final 
issue of <i>Kommunist</i> (May 1918) had to be published as a private factional 
paper. The settlement of these important issues, profoundly affecting the whole 
working class, had not been</p>

<p class="quoteb">"by discussion, persuasion or compromise, but by a 
high-pressure campaign in the Party organizations, backed by a barrage of 
violent invective in the Party press and in the pronouncements of the Party 
leaders. Lenin's polemics set the tone and his organizational lieutenants 
brought the membership into line".<a href="#n49" name="fn49" target="_self">[49]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h16">April 28</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Lenin's article on "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government" 
published in <i>Isvestiya</i> of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. 
"Measures and decrees" were called for "to raise labour discipline" which was 
"the condition of economic revival". (Among the measures suggested were the 
introduction of a card system for registering the productivity of each worker, 
the introduction of factory regulations in every enterprise, the establishment 
of rate-of-output bureaux for the purpose of fixing the output of each worker 
and payment of bonuses for increased productivity.) If Lenin ever sensed the 
potentially harmful aspects of these proposals he certainly never mentioned it. 
No great imagination was needed, however, to see in the pen-pushers (recording 
the "productivity of each worker") and in the clerks (manning the 
"rate-of-output bureaux") the as yet amorphous elements of a new bureaucracy. 
Lenin went even further. He wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"We must raise the question of piecework and apply and test it 
in practice...we must raise the question of applying much of what is 
scientific and progressive in the Taylor 
system<a href="#n50" name="fn50" target="_self">[50]</a>...the Soviet Republic must at all costs adopt all that is valuable in the 
achievements of science and technology in this field...we must organize in 
Russia the study and teaching of the Taylor system."</p>

<p class="fst">Only "the conscious representatives of petty-bourgeois laxity" 
could see in the recent decree on the management of the railways, "which granted 
individual leaders dictatorial powers", some kind of "departure from the 
collegium principle, from democracy and from other principles of soviet 
government":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The irrefutable experience of history has shown that the 
dictatorship of individual persons was very often the vehicle, the channel of 
the dictatorship of the revolutionary classes.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Large-scale machine industry - which is the material 
productive source and foundation of socialism - calls for absolute and strict 
unity of will...How can strict unity of will be ensured? By thousands 
subordinating their will to the will of one.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Unquestioning submission</i> [emphasis in original] to a 
single will is absolutely necessary for the success of labour processes that are 
based on large-scale machine industry...today the Revolution demands, in the 
interests of socialism, that the masses <i>unquestioningly obey the single will</i> 
[emphasis in original] of the leaders of the labour process".<a href="#n51" name="fn51" target="_self">[51]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The demand for "unquestioning" obedience has, throughout history, 
been voiced by countless reactionaries, who have sought moreover to impose such 
obedience on those over whom they exerted authority. A highly critical (and 
self-critical) attitude is, on the other hand, the hallmark of the real 
revolutionary.</p>

<h4><a name="h18">May 5</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Publication of <i>Left-Wing Childishness and Petty-Bourgeois 
Mentality</i>. After denouncing <i>Kommunist's</i> views as "a riot of 
phrase-mongering", "the flaunting of high-sounding phrases", etc., etc., etc., 
Lenin attempted to answer some of the points made by the "left" Communists. 
According to Lenin "state capitalism" wasn't a danger. It was, on the contrary, 
something to be aimed for:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"If we introduced state capitalism in approximately six 
months' time we would achieve a great success and a sure guarantee that within a 
year socialism will have gained a permanently firm hold and will have become 
invincible in our country.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Economically, state capitalism is immeasurably superior to the 
present system of economy...the soviet power has nothing terrible to fear from 
it, for the soviet state is a state in which the power of the workers and the 
poor is assured [because a "Workers' Party" held political power]."</p>

<p class="fst">The "<i>sum total</i> of the necessary conditions for socialism" 
were "large-scale capitalist technique based on the last word of modern 
science...inconceivable without planned state organization which subjects tens of 
millions of people to the strictest observance of a single standard in 
production and distribution" and "proletarian state power". (It is important to 
note that the power of the working class <i>in production</i> isn't mentioned as 
one of the "necessary conditions for socialism".) Lenin continues by pointing 
out that in 1918 the "two unconnected halves of socialism existed side by side 
like two future chickens in a single shell of international imperialism". In 
1918 Germany and Russia were the embodiments, respectively of the "economic, 
productive and social economic conditions for socialism on the one hand, and of 
the political conditions on the other". The task of the Bolsheviks was "to study 
the state capitalism of the Germans, to spare no effort at copying if. They 
shouldn't "shrink from adopting dictatorial methods to hasten the copying of 
it". As originally published<a href="#n53" name="fn53" target="_self">[53]</a> 
Lenin's text then contained the interesting phrase: "Our task is to hasten this 
even more than Peter hastened the adoption of westernism by barbarian Russia, 
not shrinking from the use of barbarous methods to fight barbarism". This was 
perhaps the only admiring reference to any Tsar, in any of Lenin's writings. In 
quoting this passage three years later Lenin omitted the reference to Peter the 
Great.<a href="#n54" name="fn54" target="_self">[54]</a></p>

<p class="fst">"One and the same road", Lenin continued, led from the 
petty-bourgeois capitalism that prevailed in Russia in 1918 to large-scale 
capitalism and to socialism, through one and the same intermediary station 
called "national accounting and control of production and distribution". 
Fighting against state capitalism, in April 1918, was (according to Lenin) 
"beating the air".<a href="#n55" name="fn55" target="_self">[55]</a> The 
allegation that the Soviet Republic was threatened with "evolution in the 
direction of state capitalism" would "provoke nothing but Homeric laughter". If 
a merchant told him that there had been an improvement on some railways, "such 
praise seems to me a thousand times more valuable than twenty Communist 
resolutions".<a href="#n56" name="fn56" target="_self">[56]</a> When reading 
passages such as the above, it is difficult to understand how some comrades can 
simultaneously claim to be "Leninists" and claim that the Russian society is a 
form of state capitalism to be deplored. Some, however, manage to do just this.</p>

<p class="fst">It is crystal clear from the above (and from other passages 
written at the time) that the "proletarian" nature of the regime was seen by 
nearly all the Bolshevik leaders as hinging on the proletarian nature of the 
Party that had taken state power. None of them saw the proletarian nature of the 
Russian regime as primarily and crucially dependent on the exercise of workers' 
power <i>at the point of production</i> (i.e. on workers' management of 
production). It should have been obvious to them, as Marxists, that if the 
working class did not hold economic power, its "political" power would at best 
be insecure and would in fact soon degenerate. The Bolshevik leaders saw the 
capitalist organization of production as something which, in itself, was 
socially neutral. It could be used indifferently for bad purposes (as when the 
bourgeoisie used it with the aim of private accumulation) or good ones (as when 
the "workers' state" used it "for the benefit of the many"). Lenin put this 
quite bluntly. "Socialism", he said, "is nothing but state-capitalist monopoly 
made to benefit the whole people".<a href="#n57" name="fn57" target="_self">[57]</a> 
What was wrong with capitalist methods of production, in Lenin's eyes, was that 
they had in the past served the bourgeoisie. They were now going to be used by 
the Workers' State and would thereby become "one of the conditions of 
socialism". It all depended on who held state power.<a href="#n58" name="fn58" target="_self">[58]</a> 
The argument that Russia was a workers' state <i>because</i> 
of the nationalization of the means of production was only put forward by 
Trotsky...in 1936! He was trying to reconcile his view that "the Soviet Union 
had to be defended" with his view that "the Bolshevik Party was no longer a 
workers' party".</p>

<h4><a name="h19">May 24 -June 4</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>First All-Russian Congress of Regional Economic Councils</b> 
held in Moscow. This "economic Parliament" was attended by rather more than a 
hundred voting delegates (and 150 non-voting delegates) drawn from Vesenka, its <i>
glavki</i> and centres, from regional and local Sovnarkhozy, and from the trade 
unions.</p>

<p class="fst">The Congress was presided over by Rykov - a man of "unimpeachable 
record and colourless opinions"<a href="#n59" name="fn59" target="_self">[59]</a> 
Lenin opened the proceedings with a plea for "labour discipline" and a long 
explanation for the need to employ the highly paid <i>spetsy</i> (specialists).</p>

<p class="fst">Osinsky stood uncompromisingly for the democratization of 
industry. He led an attack on "piece rates" and "Taylorism". He was supported by 
Smirnov and a number of provincial delegates. The "opposition" urged the 
recognition and completion of the <i>de facto</i> nationalization of industry 
which the Factory Committees were bringing about and called for the 
establishment of an overall national economic authority based on and 
representing the organs of workers' control.<a href="#n60" name="fn60" target="_self">[60]</a> 
They called for "a workers' administration...not only from above but from 
below" as the indispensable economic base for the new regime. Lomov, in a plea 
for a massive extension of workers' control, warned that</p>

<p class="quoteb">"bureaucratic centralization...was strangling the forces of 
the country. The masses are being cut off from living, creative power in all 
branches of our economy".</p>

<p class="fst">He reminded the Congress that Lenin's phrase about "learning from 
the capitalists" had been coined in the 1890s by the quasi-Marxist (and present 
bourgeois) Struve.<a href="#n61" name="fn61" target="_self">[61]</a> There 
then took place one of those episodes which can highlight a whole discussion and 
epitomize the various viewpoints. A sub-committee of the Congress passed a 
resolution that <i>
two-thirds</i> of the representatives on the management boards of industrial 
enterprises should be elected from among the workers.<a href="#n62" name="fn62" target="_self">[62]</a> 
Lenin was furious at this "stupid decision". Under his guidance a Plenary 
Session of the Congress "corrected" the resolution and decreed that no more than <i>
one-third</i> of the managerial personnel of industrial enterprises should be 
elected. The management committees were to be integrated into the previously 
outlined complex hierarchical structure which vested veto rights in the Supreme 
Economic Council (Vesenka) set up in December 1917.<a href="#n63" name="fn63" target="_self">[63]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Congress formally endorsed a resolution from the Trade Union 
Central Council asserting the principle of "a definite, fixed rate of 
productivity in return for a guaranteed wage". It accepted the institution of 
piecework and of bonuses. A "climate of opinion rather than a settled policy was 
in the course of formation".<a href="#n64" name="fn64" target="_self">[64]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Council of Peoples' Commissars, after an all-night sitting,

were "a decisive struggle against disorganization in production and supply".</p>

<p class="fst">The sectors affected, whose assets were now declared the property 
of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, were the mining, 
metallurgical, textile, electrical, timber, tobacco, resin, glass and pottery, 
leather and cement industries, all steam-driven mills, local utilities and 
private railways, together with a few other minor industries. The task of 
"organizing the administration of nationalized enterprises" was entrusted "as a 
matter of urgency" to Vesenka and its sections. But until Vesenka issued 
specific instructions regarding individual enterprises covered by the decree 
"such enterprises would be regarded as leased rent-free to their former owners, 
who would continue to finance them and to draw revenue from them".<a href="#n65" name="fn65" target="_self">[65]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The legal transfer of individual enterprises to the state was 
easily transacted. The assumption of managerial functions by appointees was to 
take a little longer but this process was also to be completed within a few 
months. Both steps had been accelerated under the threat of foreign 
intervention. The change in the <i>property relations</i> had been deep-going. <i>
In this sense</i> a profound revolution had taken place. "As the Revolution had 
unleashed Civil War, so Civil War was to intensify the Revolution".<a href="#n66" name="fn66" target="_self">[66]</a> 
But as far as any fundamental changes in the relations of production were 
concerned, the Revolution was already spent. The period of "War Communism" - now 
starting - was to see the working class lose what little power it had enjoyed <i>
in production</i>, during the last few weeks of 1917 and the first few weeks of 
1918.</p>

<h4><a name="h22">July 4-10</a></h4>

<p class="fst"><b>Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets.</b></p>

<p class="fst">Throughout the first half of 1918 the issue of "nationalization" 
had been the subject of bitter controversy between the "left" Communists and the 
Leninists. Lenin had been opposed to the total nationalization of the means of 
production, immediately after October. This was not because of any wish to do a 
political deal with the bourgeoisie but because of his underestimation of the 
technological and administrative maturity of the proletariat, a maturity that 
would have been put to an immediate test had all major industry been formally 
nationalized. The result had been an extremely complex situation in which some 
industries had been nationalized "from above", (i.e. by decree of the Central 
Government), others "from below" (i.e. where workers had taken over enterprises 
abandoned by their former owners), while in yet other places the former owners 
were still in charge of their factories - although restricted in their freedom 
of action or authority by the encroachment of the Factory Committees. Kritzman, 
one of the ablest theoreticians of "left" Communism, had criticized this state 
of affairs from an early date. He had referred to the "Workers' Control" decree 
of November 14, 1917, as "half-measures, therefore unrealizable":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"As a slogan workers' control implied the growing but as yet 
insufficient power of the proletariat. It was the implied expression of a 
weakness, still to be overcome, of the working-class movement. Employers would 
not be inclined to run their businesses with the sole aim of teaching the 
workers how to manage them. Conversely the workers felt only hatred for the 
capitalists and saw no reason why they should voluntarily remain exploited".<a href="#n67" name="fn67" target="_self">[67]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Osinsky, another "left" Communist, stressed another aspect. "The 
fate of the workers' control slogan", he wrote,</p>

<p class="quoteb">"is most interesting. Born of the wish to unmask the opponent, 
it failed when it sought to convert itself into a system. Where, despite 
everything it fulfilled itself, its content altered completely from what we had 
originally envisaged. It took the form of a decentralized dictatorship, of the 
subordination of capitalists, taken individually, to various working-class 
organizations acting independently of one another...Workers' Control had 
originally been aimed at subordinating the owners of the means of 
production...But this co-existence soon became intolerable. The state of dual power between 
managers and workers soon led to the collapse of the enterprise. Or it rapidly 
became transformed into the total power of the workers, without the least 
authorization of the central powers."<a href="#n68" name="fn68" target="_self">[68]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Much "left" Communist writing at this time stressed the theme 
that early nationalization of the means of production would have avoided many of 
these ambiguities. Total expropriation of the capitalists would have allowed one 
to proceed immediately from "workers' control" to "workers' management" through 
the medium of some central organism regulating the whole of the socialized 
economy. It is interesting that Lozovsky, although at the time strongly opposed 
to the viewpoint of the "left" Communists (because he felt that the Revolution 
had only been a "bourgeois-democratic" revolution), was later to write: "It was 
soon to be proved that in the era of social revolution, a constitutional 
monarchy in each enterprise [i.e. the previous boss, but only exercising limited 
power (MB)] was impossible and that the former owner - however complex the 
structure of a modern enterprise - was a superfluous cog".<a href="#n69" name="fn69" target="_self">[69]</a> 
A split occurred a little later among the "left" Communists. Radek reached an 
agreement with the Leninists. He was prepared to accept "one-man management" in 
principle (not too hard a task for a non-proletarian?) because it was now to be 
applied in the context of the extensive nationalization decrees of June 1918. In 
Radek's opinion these decrees would help ensure the "proletarian basis of the 
regime". Bukharin too broke with Osinsky and rejoined the fold. Osinsky and his 
supporters however proceeded to form a new oppositional tendency: the 
"democratic centralists" (so-called because of their opposition to the 
"bureaucratic centralism" of the Party leadership). They continued to agitate 
for workers' management of production. Their ideas, and those of the original 
group of "left" Communists were to play an important role in the development, 
two years later, of the Workers' Opposition.</p>

<p class="fst">With the Civil War and "War Communism" the issues appeared, for a 
while, to become blurred. There was little production for any one to control:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The issues of 1918 however were only postponed. They could 
not be forgotten thanks to the left communists' work of criticism. As soon as 
the military respite permitted, left-wing oppositionists were ready to raise 
again the fundamental question of the social nature of the Soviet regime".<a href="#n70" name="fn70" target="_self">[70]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h23">August</a></h4>

<p class="fst">High point of Volga offensive by the Whites.</p>

<p class="fst">The Civil War immensely accelerated the process of economic 
centralization. As a knowledge of previous Bolshevik practice might have led one 
to expect, this was to prove an extremely bureaucratic form of centralization. 
The whole Russian economy was "reorganized" on a semi-military basis. The Civil 
War tended to transform all major industry into a supply organization for the 
Red Army. This made industrial policy a matter of military strategy. It is worth 
pointing out, at this stage, that we doubt if there is any <i>intrinsic</i> 
merit in decentralization, as some anarchists maintain. The Paris Commune, a 
Congress of Soviets (or a shop stewards' committee or strike committee to take 
modern analogies) are all highly centralized yet fairly democratic. Feudalism on 
the other hand was both decentralized and highly bureaucratic. The key question 
is whether the "centralized" apparatus is controlled from below (by elected and 
revocable delegates) or whether it separates itself from those on whose behalf 
it is allegedly acting.</p>

<p class="fst">This period witnessed a considerable fall in production, due to a 
complex variety of factors which have been well described elsewhere.<a href="#n71" name="fn71" target="_self">[71]</a> 
The trouble was often blamed by Party spokesmen on the influence of heretical 
"anarcho-syndicalist" ideas. Mistakes had certainly been made, but what had been 
the growing pains of a new movement were now being attributed to the inherent 
vices of any attempt by the workers to dominate production. "Workers' control 
over industry carried out by the Factory and Plant Committees", wrote one 
government spokesman, "has shown what can be expected if the plans of the 
anarchists are realized".<a href="#n72" name="fn72" target="_self">[72]</a> 
Attempts at control from below were now being systematically suppressed. 
Proletarian partisans of the individual Factory Committees tried to resist but 
their resistance was easily overcome.<a href="#n73" name="fn73" target="_self">[73]</a> 
Bitterness and despair developed among sections of the proletariat (and by no 
means "backward" sections). Such factors must also be taken into account - but 
seldom are - in discussing the fall of production, and the widespread resort to 
"antisocial activities" so characteristic of the years of "War Communism".</p>

<h4><a name="h30">December</a></h4>

<p class="fst">A new decree abolished the regional Sovnarkhozy and recognized 
the provincial Sovnarkhozy as "executive organs of Vesenka". The local 
Sovnarkhozy were to become "economic sections" of the executive committees of 
the corresponding local Soviets. The <i>glavki</i> were to have their own 
subordinate organs at provincial headquarters. "This clearly represented a 
further step towards the centralized control of every branch of industry all 
over the country by its <i>glavk</i> or centre in Moscow, under the supreme 
authority of Vesenka".<a href="#n81" name="fn81" target="_self">[81]</a></p>

<p class="fst"><b>Second All-Russian Congress of Regional Economic Councils.</b></p>

<p class="fst">Molotov analyzed the membership of twenty most important <i>
glavki</i> and "centres". Of 400 persons concerned, over 10 per cent were former 
employers or employers' representatives, 9 per cent technicians, 38 per cent 
officials from various departments (including Vesenka)...and the remaining 43 
per cent workers or representatives of workers' organizations, including trade 
unions. The management of production was predominantly in the hands of persons 
"having no relation to the proletarian elements in industry". The <i>glavki</i> 
had to be regarded as "organs in no way corresponding to the proletarian 
dictatorship". Those who directed policy were "employers' representatives, 
technicians and specialists".<a href="#n82" name="fn82" target="_self">[82]</a> 
"It was indisputable that the Soviet bureaucrat of these early years was as a 
rule a former member of the bourgeois intelligentsia or official class, and 
brought with him many of the traditions of the old Russian bureaucracy".<a href="#n83" name="fn83" target="_self">[83]</a></p>

<h3><a name="h32">Remarks:</a></h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="r1" href="#rn1">[1*]</a> D. B. Ryazanov, a 
Marxist scholar best known as the historiographer of the International 
Workingmen's Association (the First International), later became the founder of 
the Marx-Engels Institute in Moscow and published a biography of Marx and 
Engels.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r2" href="#rn2">[2*]</a> Gregori Petrovich 
Maximov, born in 1893. Graduated as an agronomist in Petrograd in 1915. Joined 
the revolutionary movement while still a student. In 1918 joined the Red Army. 
When the Bolsheviks used the Army for police work and for disarming the workers 
he refused to obey orders and was sentenced to death. The solidarity of the 
steelworkers' union saved his life.</p>

<p class="endnote">Edited anarcho-syndicalist papers <i>Golos Truda</i> (Voice 
of Labour) and <i>Novy Golos Truda</i> (New Voice of Labour). Arrested March 8, 
1921, during the Kronstadt uprising. Released later that year following a hunger 
strike, but only after the intervention of European delegates attending Congress 
of Red Trade Union International. Sought exile abroad.</p>

<p class="endnote">In Berlin edited <i>Rabotchi Put</i> (Labour's Path), paper 
of Russian syndicalists in exile. Later went to Paris and finally settled in 
Chicago. Died 1950. Author of various works on anarchism and on the Bolshevik 
terror (<i>The Guillotine at Work</i>, 1940).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r3" href="#rn3">[3*]</a> It is interesting that 
as great a "Marxist" as Rosa Luxemburg was to proclaim at the founding Congress 
of the German Communist Party (January 1919) that the trade unions were destined 
to disappear, being replaced by Councils of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies and 
by Factory Committees (<i>Bericht über die Verhandlung des Gründungparteitages 
der KPD</i> (1919), pp. 16, 80).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r4" href="#rn4">[4*]</a> Vladimir Shatov, born 
in Russia, emigrated to Canada and USA. In 1914 secretly reprinted 100,000 
copies of Margaret Sanger's notorious birth-control pamphlet, <i>Family 
Limitation</i>. Worked as machinist longshoreman and printer. Joined IWW. Later 
helped produce <i>Golos Truda</i>, weekly anarcho-syndicalist organ of the Union 
of Russian Workers of the United States and Canada. Returned to Petrograd in 
July 1917 and "replanted <i>Golos Truda</i> in the Russian capital". Later 
became member of Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee and an officer of 
the 10th Red Army. In 1919 he played important role in defence of Petrograd 
against Yudenich. In 1920 became Minister of Transport in the Far Eastern Soviet 
Republic. Disappeared during the 1936-38 purges.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r5" href="#rn5">[5*]</a> For years Trotskyist 
literature has denounced these reactionary facets of the Red Army as examples of 
what happened to it "under Stalinism". They were in fact first challenged by 
Smirnov at the Eighth Party Congress, in March 1919.</p>
