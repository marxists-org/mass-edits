    <p>Through all the chorus of abuse and misrepresentation directed against the Russian Soviets by the capitalist press there runs a voice shrill with a sort of panic, which cries: &#8216;There is no government in Russia! There is no organisation among the Russian workers! It will not work! It will not work!&#8217;</p>
    <p>There is method in the slander.</p>
    <p>As all real socialists know, and as we who have seen the Russian Revolution can testify, there is today in Moscow and throughout all the cities and towns of the Russian land a highly complex political structure, which is upheld by the vast majority of the people and which is functioning as well as any newborn popular government ever functioned. Also the workers of Russia have fashioned from their necessities and the demands of life an economic organisation which is evolving into a true industrial democracy.</p>
    <p>In my last asrticle I told something of the external aspect of proletarian Russia. In this I shall sketch the framework of the Soviet state.</p>
    <h4>History of the Soviets</h4>
    <p>The Soviet state is based upon the Soviets (or Councils) of Workers, and Peasants&#8217; Soviets.</p>
    <p>These Councils or institutions so characteristic of the Russian Revolution  originated in 1905, when, during the first general strike of the workers, Petrograd factories and labour organisations sent delegates to a Central Committee. This Strike Committee was named Council of Workers&#8217; Deputies. It called the second general strike of the fall of 1905, sent out organisers all over Russia, and for a short time was recognised by the Imperial Government as the authorised spokesman of the revolutionary Russian working class.</p>
    <p>Upon the failure of the 1905 Revolution, the members of the Council either fled or were sent to Siberia. But so astoundingly effective as a political organ was this type of union that all revolutionary parties included a Council of Workers&#8217; Deputies in their plans for the next uprising.</p>
    <p>In March 1917, when, in the face of all Russia rearing like a sea, the Tsar abdicated and Grand Duke Michael declined the throne, and the reluctant Duma was forced to assume the reins of government, the Council of Workers&#8217; Deputies sprang fully-fledged into being. In a few days it was enlarged to include delegates of the Army, and called the Council of Workers&#8217; <em>and Soldiers&#8217;</em> Deputies. Except for Kerensky the Duma Committee was composed of <em>bourgeois,</em> and had no connection with the revolutionary masses whatever. Fighting had to be done, order had to be restored, the front guarded..... The Duma members had no way of executing these duties; they were obliged to appeal to the representatives of the workers and soldiers  in other words the Council. The Council took charge of the work of Revolution, of co-ordinating the activities of the people, preserving order. Moreover, it assumed the task of assuring the Revolution against its betrayal by the <em>bourgeoisie.</em></p>
    <p>From the moment when the Duma was forced to appeal to the Council, two governments existed in Russia and these two governments struggled for the mastery until November 1917, when the Soviets, with the Bolsheviks in control, overthrew the Coalition Government.</p>
    <p>There were, as I have said, Soviets of both Workers&#8217; and of Soldiers&#8217; Deputies. Somewhat later there came into being Soviets of Peasants&#8217; Deputies. In most cities the Workers&#8217; and Soldiers&#8217; Soviets met together; they also held their All-Russian Congress jointly. The Peasants&#8217; Soviets, however, were held aloof by the reactionary elements in control, and did not join with the workers and soldiers until the November revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Government.</p>
    <h4>Constitution of the Soviets</h4>
    <p>The Soviet is based directly upon the workers in the factories and the peasants in the fields.</p>
    <p>Until the spring of 1918 there existed Soviets of Soldiers&#8217; Deputies. These were abolished after the demobilization of the old army at the treaty of Brest-Litivsk, when the soldiers were absorbed into the factories and the farms.</p>
    <p>At first the delegates of Workers&#8217;, Soldiers&#8217; and Peasants&#8217; Soviets were elected according to rules which varied with the needs and population of various localities. In some villages the peasants chose one delegate for each fifty voters. Soldiers in garrison were given a certain number of delegates for each regiment, regardless of its strength; the army in the field, however, had a different method of electing their Soviets. As for the workers in the great cities, they soon found out that their Soviets became unwieldy unless the delegates were limited to one for each five hundred. In the same way, the first two All-Russian Congresses of Soviets were roughly based upon one delegate for each twenty five thousand voters, but in fact the delegates represented constituencies of various sizes.</p>
    <p>Until February 1918 anybody could vote for delegates to the Soviets. <em>Even had the bourgeoisie organised and demanded representation in the Soviets, they would have been given it.</em> For example, during the regime of the Provisional Government there was <em>bourgeois</em> representation in the Petrograd Soviet &#8211; a delegate of the Union of Professional Men which comprised doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc.</p>
    <p>Last March, the <a href="../../../history/ussr/government/constitution/1918/index.htm">constitution of the Soviets</a> was worked out in detail and applied universally.</p>
    <p>It restricted the franchise too</p>
    <p>&#8220;Citizens of the Russian Socialist Republic of both sexes who shall have completed their eighteenth year by the day of election....&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;All who have acquired the means of living through labour that is productive and useful to society and who are members of labour unions.....&#8221;</p>
    <p>Excluded from the right to vote were: employers of labour for profit; persons who lived on unearned increment; merchants and agents of private business; employers of religious communities; former members of the police and gendarmerie; the former ruling dynasty; the mentally deficient; the deaf and dumb; and those who had been punished for <em>selfish and dishonourable misdemeanours.</em></p>
    <p>As far as the peasants are concerned, each hundred peasants in the villages elect one representative to the Volost, or Township, Soviet. These Volost Soviets send delegates to the Uyezd, or County, Soviets, which in turn send delegates to the Oblast, or Provincial, Soviet, to which also are elected delegates from the Workers&#8217; Soviets in the cities.</p>
    <p>The Petrograd Soviet of Workers&#8217; and Soldiers&#8217; Deputies, which was in operation when I was in Russia, may serve as an example of how the urban units of government function under the socialist state.</p>
    <p>It consisted of about 1200 deputies, and in normal circumstances held a plenary session every two weeks. In the meantime, it elected a Central Executive Committee of 110 members, based upon party proportionality, and this Central Executive Committee <em>added to itself by invitation</em> delegates from the central committees of all the political parties, from the central committees of the professional unions, the factory shop committees, and other democratic organisations.</p>
    <p>Besides the big City Soviet, there were also the Rayon, or Ward, Soviets. These were made up of the deputies elected from each ward to the City Soviet, and administered their part of the city. Naturally, in some wards there were no factories, and therefore normally no representation of the ward either in the City Soviet or in Ward Soviets of their own. But the Soviet system is extremely flexible, and if the cooks and waiters, or the street sweepers, or the courtyard servants, or the cab drivers of that ward organised and demanded representation, they were allowed delegates.</p>
    <p>Elections of delegates are based on proportional representation, which means that the political parties are represented in exact proportion to the number of voters in the whole city. And it is <em>political parties and programmes</em> which are voted for o not candidates. The candidates are designated by the central committees of the political parties, which can replace them by other party members. Also the delegates are not elected for any particular term, but are subject to recall <em>at any time.</em></p>
    <p>No political body more sensitive and responsive to the popular will was ever invented. And this was necessary, for in time of revolution the popular will changes with great rapidity. For example, during the first week of December 1917, there were parades and demonstrations in favour of a Constituent Assembly othat is to say, against the Soviet power. One of these parades was fired on by some irresponsible Red Guards, and several people killed. The reaction to this stupid violence was immediate. <em>Within twelve hours the complexion of the Petrograd Soviet changed.</em> More than a dozen Bolshevik deputies were withdrawn, and replaced by Mensheviki. And it was three weeks before public sentiment subsided o before the Mensheviki were retired one by one and the Bolsheviki sent back.</p>
    <h4>The Soviet State</h4>
    <p>At least twice a year delegates are elected from all over Russia to the <a href="../../../glossary/events/a/l.htm#arcs">All-Russian Congress of Soviets</a>. Theoretically these delegates are chosen by direct popular election: from the provinces, one for each hundred and twenty five thousand voters o from the cities, one for each twenty five thousand; in practice, however, they are usually chosen by the provincial and the urban Soviets. An extraordinary session of the Congress can be called at any time upon the initiative of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, or upon the demand of Soviets representing one third of the working population of Russia.</p>
    <p>This body, consisting of about two thousand delegates, meets in the capital in the form of a <em>great Soviet,</em> and settles upon the essentials of national policy. It elects a Central Executive Committee, like the Central Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, which invites delegates from the central committees of all democratic organisations.</p>
    <p>This augmented Central Executive Committee of the Russian Soviets is the <em>parliament</em> of the Russian Republic. It consists of about three hundred and fifty persons. Between AlloRussian Congresses it is the supreme authority; it must not act outside the lines laid down by the last Congress, and is strictly responsible in all its acts to the next Congress.</p>
    <p>For example, the Central Executive Committee can, and did, order that the peace treaty with Germany be signed, But it could not make this treaty binding on Russia. Only the All Russian Congress has power to ratify the treaty.</p>
    <p>The Central Executive Committee elects from its midst eleven Commissars, to be chairmen of committees in charge of the different branches of government, in place of ministers. These Commissars can be recalled <em>at any time.</em> They are strictly responsible to the Central Executive Committee. The Commissars elect a chairman. Ever since the Soviet Government has been formed, this chairman o or Premier o has been Nicolai Lenin. If his leadership were unsatisfactory, Lenin could be recalled at any moment by the delegation of the masses of the Russian people, or in a few weeks&#8217; time directly by the Russian people themselves.</p>
    <p>The chief function of the Soviets is the defence and consolidation of the Revolution. They express the political will of the masses, not only in the All Russian Congresses, for the whole country, but also in their own localities, where their authority is practically supreme. This decentralisation exists because the local Soviets create the central government, and not the central government the local Soviets. In spite of local autonomy, however, the decrees of the Central Executive Committee, and the orders of the Commissars, are valid throughout all the country, because under the Soviet Republic there are no sectional or private interests to serve, and the cause of the Revolution is everywhere the same.</p>
    <p>Illoinformed observers, mostly from the middle class <em>Intelligentsia,</em> are fond of remarking that they are in favour of the Soviets, but against the Bolsheviks. This is an absurdity. The Soviets are the most perfect organs of working class representation, it is true, but they are also the weapons of proletarian dictatorship, to which all antioBolshevik parties are bitterly opposed. So the measure of the adherence of the people to the policy of proletarian dictatorship is not only measured by the membership of the Bolshevik Party o or, as it is now called, the Communist Party o but also by the growth and activity of local Soviets all over Russia.</p>
    <p>The most striking example of this is among the peasants, who did not take the leadership of the revolution, and whose primitive and almost exclusive interest in it was the confiscation of the great estates. The Soviets of Peasants&#8217; Deputies at first had practically no other function except the solution of the land question. It was the failure of the land solution under the coalition government which turned the attention of the great mass of peasants to the social reasons behind this failure o that, coupled with the ceaseless propaganda of the left wing of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and of the Bolsheviki, and the return to the villages of the revolutionary soldiers.</p>
    <p>The traditional party of the peasants is the Socialist Revolutionary Party. The great inert mass of peasants whose only interest was in their land, and who had neither fighting stamina nor political initiative, at first refused to have anything to do with the Soviets. Those peasants, however, who did participate in the Soviets soon awoke to the idea of the proletarian dictatorship. And they almost invariably joined the Left Socialist Revolutionary Party, and became fighting partisans of the Soviet government.</p>
    <p>In the Commissariat of Agriculture in Petrograd hangs a map of Russia, sprinkled with red-headed pins. Each of these red-headed pins represents a Soviet of Peasants&#8217; Deputies. When I first saw the map, hanging in the old headquarters of the Peasants&#8217; Soviets at 6 Fontanka, the red points were sprinkled sparsely over the vast country, nor did the numbers grow. For the first eight months of the revolution there were <em>volosts, uyezds,</em> whole provinces in fact where only one or two large towns would show a Peasants&#8217; Soviet, and perhaps a scattering of villages. After the November Revolution, however, you could see all Russia redder under your eyes, as village after village, county after county, province after province, awoke and formed its Peasant Council.</p>
    <p>At the time of the Bolshevik insurrection a Constituent Assembly with an anti-Soviet majority could be elected; one month later it would have been impossible. I saw three All-Russian Peasants Conventions in Petrograd. The delegates arrived o the vast majority of them Right Socialist Revolutionaries They met in session o and very stormy sessions they always were o under the presidency of conservatives of the type of Avksentiev and Peshekhanov. In a few days they would move to the left and be dominated by pseudo-radicals like Tchernov. A few days later the majority would become very radical, and Maria Spiridonova would be elected chairman. Then the conservative minority would split off and set up a rump convention, which in a few days dwindled to nothing. And the main body would send delegates to join the Soviets at Smolny. This happened every time.</p>
    <p>I shall never forget the Peasants&#8217; Conference which took place towards the end of November, and how Tchernov fought for control and lost it, and that wonderful procession of grizzled proletarians of the soil who marched to Smolny through the snowy streets, singing, their blood-red banners floating in the bitter wind. It was dark night. On the steps of SmoIny hundreds of working men were waiting to receive their peasant brothers, and in the dim light the two masses moving one down and the other up, rushed together and embraced, and wept, and cheered.....</p>
    <h4>Land Committees</h4>
    <p>The Soviets can pass decrees effecting fundamental economic changes, but these must be carried out by the local popular organisations themselves.</p>
    <p>The confiscation and distribution of the land, for example, were left to the Peasants&#8217; Land Committees.</p>
    <p>These Land Committees were elected by the peasants at the suggestion of Prince Lvov, first premier of the Provisional Government Some settlement of the land question was inevitable, by which the great estates should be broken up and distributed among the peasants. Prince Lvov asked the peasants to elect Land Committees, which should not only determine their own agricultural needs, but should also survey and make a valuation of the landed estates. But when these Land Committees attempted to function, the landlords had them arrested.</p>
    <p>When the Soviets seized the power, its first action was to promulgate the Decree of the Land. This Land Decree was not a Bolshevik project at all, but the programme of the Right (or moderate) Socialist Revolutionary Party, drawn up on the basis of several hundred peasant memorials. It abolished forever private title to land or to natural resources in Russia, and gave over to the Land Committees the task of apportioning the land among the peasants, until the Constituent Assembly should finally settle the question. After the dissolution of the Constitution Assembly, the Decree was made final.</p>
    <p>Outside of these few general propositions, and a section providing for the emigration of surplus population in congested neighbourhoods, the details of confiscation and distribution were left entirely to the local Land Committee. Kalagayev, the first Commissar of Agriculture, drew up an elaborate set of rules to guide the peasants in their action. But Lenin, in a speech before the Central Executive Committee, persuaded the government to leave the peasants to manage the matter in a revolutionary way, merely advising the poor peasants to combine against the rich peasants. ("Let ten poor peasants oppose every rich peasant,&#8221; said Lenin.)</p>
    <p>Of course no peasant could own his land, but still, he could take what land was due him and treat it as his private property. But the policy of the government, acting through the local Land Committee, is to discourage this tendency. Peasants who wish to become private landlords may do so, but they are not assisted by the government On the other hand, peasants who farm cooperatively are given credit, seed, implements and modern technical training.</p>
    <p>Attached to the Land Committees are agricultural and forestry experts. In order to coordinate the practices of the local Committees a central body is elected from them, known as the Main Land Committee, which sits in the capital, in close touch with the Commissariat of Agriculture.</p>
    <h4>Labor Unions</h4>
    <p>Labor Unions in Russia, as at present constituted, are less than twenty years old. Before the Revolution of 1905 there was very little economic organization among the workers and that was illegal. During the Revolution of 1905 actual paid membership in the Professional Unions was about fifty thousand, and the reaction of 1906 outlawed them entirely.</p>
    <p>The Russian Unions are an artificial development. They were designed by intellectuals, who made a scientific study of the labor organizations in other countries, constucted on paper the ideal labor union (in this case, a combination of the French <em>syndicats</em> with the German trade-union system), and applied it to Russia. The Russian unions, however, are industrial unions of the broadest kindofor example, in a cannon-factory the carpenters who make the gun-carriages are members of the Metal Workers Union.</p>
    <p>In the frst three months of the Revolution the membership of the Unions grew to more than two hundred thousand. Five months later the number of organized men over a million, and two months after that more than three million were registered.</p>
    <p>After the manner of Labor Unions everywhere, the Professional Unions undertook the routine business of working for higher wages, shorter hours and better conditions, demanded Boards of Arbitration, and were granted representation in the Ministry of Labor of the Provisional Government.</p>
    <p>This was not enough for Russian workers in Revolution. Although large numbers joined the Unions, still open shops existed, many workers could not see the necessity for organizing, and the struggle between the working mass and the bosses of industry was confused and deadened by the Unions.</p>
    <p>Then, too, like the soldiers&#8217; Army Committees, the consitution of the Unions was such that their policy was controlled by reactionaries, against the rapidly quickening pulse of the rank and file. Thus at the time of the Bolshevik insurrection the central Committees of the telephone workers, the postal and telegraph employees and the railwaymen were able to call strikes against the Bolshekiki in Smolny Institute, and temporarily isolate them from all Russia...This im spite of the revolutionary majority of the workers, who soon called conventions and reversed the policy of their outworn leaders, electing new Committees.</p>
    <p>At the present time the function of the Professional Unions is to standardize wages, hours and consitions throughout each industry, and to maintain laboratories for efficiency and labor-saving experiments. But the Professional Unions occupy a secondary role in the organization of Russian industrial workers. The precedence belongs to another organization, a product of the conditions of the Revolution themselvesothe Factory Shop Committee.</p>
    <h4>Factory Shop Committees</h4>
    <p>When The March Revolution broke, the owners and administrators of many industrial plants either left or were driven out by the workers. In the government factories, where labour had long been at the mercy of irresponsible bureaucrats appointed by the Tsar, this was particularly the case.</p>
    <p>Without superintendents, foremen, and in many cases engineers and bookkeepers, the workers found themselves faced with the alternative of keeping the works going or of starving. A committee was elected, one delegate from each &#8220;shop&#8221; or department; this committee attempted to run the factory..... Of course, at first this plan seemed hopeless. The functions of the different departments could be coordinated in this way, but the lack of technical training on the part of the workers produced some grotesque results.</p>
    <p>Finally there was a committee meeting at one of the factories, where a workman rose and said: &#8216;Comrades, why do we worry? The question of technical experts is not a difficult one. Remember <em>the boss</em> wasn&#8217;t a technical expert; <em>the boss</em> didn&#8217;t know engineering or chemistry or bookkeeping. All he did was to <em>own.</em> When he wanted technical help, he <em>hired</em> men to do it for him. Well, now <em>we</em> are the boss. Let&#8217;s <em>hire</em> engineers, bookkeepers, and so forth o to work for <em>us!&#8217;</em></p>
    <p>In the government factories the problem was comparatively simple, since the Revolution automatically removed the &#8220;boss,&#8221; and never really substituted another. But when the Factory Shop Committees spread to the privatelyoowned works, they were viciously fought by factory owners, most of whom were making contracts with the unions.</p>
    <p>In the private factories, too, the shop committees were the product of necessity. After the first three months of the Revolution, during which the middle class and the proletarian organisations worked together in utopian harmony, the industrial capitalists began to be afraid of the growing power and ambition of the workers&#8217; organisations o just as the country landowners feared the Land Committee, and the officers the soldiers&#8217; committees and Soviets. Along about the first part of June began the more or less conscious campaign of the entire bourgeoisie to halt the Revolution, and break down the democratic organisations. Beginning with the Factory Shop Committees, the industrial owners planned to make a clean sweep of everything. including the Soviets. The army was disorganised, supplies and munitions and food diverted from it, and actual positions betrayed to the Germans o like Riga; in the country the peasants were persuaded to hoard their grain, and provoked to disorders, which gave the excuse to the Cossacks to &#8216;restore peace&#8217;; and in industry, more important than all, the machinery and operation of the factories themselves were sabotaged, transportation was still further wrecked, and the coal mines, metal mines and sources of raw materials damaged as much as possible. Every effort was made to shut down the factories and starve the workers back into submission to the old industrial regime.</p>
    <p>This the workers were forced to resist. The Factory Shop Committee sprang up and took charge. At first, of course, Russian workers made ludicrous mistakes, as all the world has been told again and again. They demanded impossible wages o they attempted to run complicated scientific manufacturing processes without proper experience; in some cases, even, they asked the boss to return at his own terms. <em>But such cases are the great minority In the majority of plants the workers were resourceful enough to be able to conduct the industry without bosses.</em></p>
    <p>The owners attempted to falsify the books, to conceal orders; the Factory Shop Committee was forced to find out ways to control the books. The owners tried to strip the works o so the committee had to rule that nothing should go in or out of the plant without permission. When the factory was going to close down for lack of fuel, raw material, or orders, the Factory Shop Committee had to send men half across Russia to the mines, or down into the Caucasus for oil, to Crimea for cotton; and agents had to be sent out by the workers to sell the product. In the break-down of the railroads, committee agents had to make agreements with the Railwaymen&#8217;s Union for transportation of freight. To guard against strikeobreakers, the committee had to take over the function of hiring and discharging workers.</p>
    <p>Thus the Factory Shop Committee was the creation of Russian anarchy, forced by necessity to learn how to manage industry, so that when the time came the Russian workers could take over actual control with little friction.</p>
    <p>As an instance of how the masses worked together, there is the matter of two hundred thousand poods of coal, which was taken from the bunkers of the Baltic battle fleet in December, and turned over by the sailors&#8217; committees to keep the factories of Petrograd running during the coal famine.</p>
    <p>Obukhov Works was a steel plant manufacturing supplies for the Navy. The chairman of the Obukhov committee was a RussianoArnerican, Petrovsky by name, well known here as an anarchist. One day the foreman of the torpedo department told Petrovsky that the department would have to close down owing to the impossibility of procuring certain small tubes used in the manufacture of torpedoes. The tubes were manufactured by a factory across the river, whose product was contracted for three months ahead. The closing down of the torpedo department meant that four hundred men would be out of work.</p>
    <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get the tubes,&#8221; said Petrovsky.</p>
    <p>He went direct to the tube factory, where, instead of calling upon the manager, he sought the chairman of the local Factory Shop Committee.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Comrade,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if we don&#8217;t get tubes in two days, our torpedo department will have to close down, and four hundred of the boys will be out of a job.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The chairman called for his factory&#8217;s books, and discovered that some thousands of the tubes were contracted for by three private plants in the vicinity. He and Petrovsky thereupon visited these three plants, and called on the Factory Shop Committee chairmen. At two of the factories it was discovered that the tubes were not immediately needed; and next day the tubes were delivered to the Obukhov Works, and the torpedo department didn&#8217;t shut down.....</p>
    <p>In Novgorod was a textile mill. At the outbreak of the revolution the owner said to himself. &#8220;Here&#8217;s trouble coming. We won&#8217;t be able to make any profits while this revolution is on. Let&#8217;s shut down the works until the thing blows over.&#8221; So he shut down the works, and he and the office force, the chemists, engineers and manager, took the train for Petrograd. The next morning the workers opened the mill.</p>
    <p>Now these workers were perhaps a little more ignorant than most workers. They knew nothing of the technical processes of manufacture, of bookkeeping or management, or selling. They elected a Factory Shop Committee, and finding a certain amount of fuel and raw materials in stock, set to work to manufacturing cotton cloth.</p>
    <p>Not knowing what was done with cotton cloth when manufactured, they first helped themselves to enough for their families. Next, some of the looms being out of order, they sent a delegate to a nearby machine-shop saying that they would give cotton cloth in exchange for mechanical assistance. This done, they made a deal with the local city Cooperative, to supply cloth in exchange for food. They even extended the principle of barter so far as to exchange bolts of cloth for fuel with the coal miners of Kharkov, and with the Railwaymen&#8217;s Union for transportation.</p>
    <p>But finally they glutted the local market with cotton cloth, and then they ran up against a demand which cloth could not satisfy o rent. This was in the days of the Provisional Government when there were still landlords. Rent had to be satisfied with money. So they loaded a train with cloth and sent it, in charge of a committeeman, to Moscow. The committeeman left his train at the station, and went down the street. He came to a tailor shop and asked if the tailor needed cloth.</p>
    <p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; asked the tailor.</p>
    <p>&#8220;A train-load", answered the committeeman.</p>
    <p>&#8220;What does it cost?</p>
    <p>&#8220;I don"t know. What do you usually pay for cloth?&#8221;</p>
    <p>The tailor got his cloth for a song, and the committeeman, who had never seen so much money at one time, went back to Novgorod highly elated.</p>
    <p>But the factory committee had been figuring on the rent question, and they had calculated on the basis of average production <em>for just how much they must sell their surplus cloth to provide enough money to pay the rent of all the workers!</em></p>
    <p>So it was that all over Russia the workers were getting the necessary education in the fundamentals of industrial production, <em>and even distribution,</em> so that when the November Revolution came they could take their places in the machinery of workers&#8217; control.</p>
    <p>It was in June 1917 that the first meeting of delegates from the shop committees was held. At this time the committees had hardly spread outside of Petrograd. It was a remarkable gathering, composed of delegates of the actual rank and file, most of them Bolsheviks, many of them Anarchists-Syndicalists; and its character was that of protest against the tactics of the trade-unions. In the political world the Bolsheviks were reiterating that no socialist had any right to participate in a coalition government with the <em>bourgeoisie.</em> The meeting of shop committee delegates put itself on record as taking the same attitude toward industry. In other words, the employing class and the workers have no interests in common; no class conscious worker can be a member of an arbitration or conciliation board except to acquaint the employers with the demands of the workers. No contracts between employers and the workers. Industrial production must be absolutely controlled by the workers.</p>
    <p>At first the unions fought bitterly against the Factory Shop Committees. But the shop committees, who were in a position to clutch the command of industry at its heart, easily extended and consolidated their power. Many workmen could not see the necessity of joining a union; but all of them saw the necessity of participating in the elections of the shop committee, which controlled their immediate jobs. On the other hand, the shop committees recognised the value of the unions; no new worker was employed unless he could show a union card; it was the shop committees which applied locally the regulations of the different unions. At the present time the unions and the Factory Shop Committees work in perfect harmony, each in its place.</p>
    <h4>Workers&#8217; Control</h4>
    <p>Private ownership of industry in Russia is not yet abolished. In many factories the owner still holds title, and is allowed a certain limited profit on his investment, on condition that he works for the success and increase of scope of the enterprise; but control is taken away from him. Those industries whose owners attempt to lock out their workers, or who, by fraud or force, try to hinder the operations of the plant, are immediately confiscated by the workers. Conditions, hours and wages in all industries, private or government-owned, are uniform.</p>
    <p>The reason for this survival of semi-capitalism, in a proletarian state, lies in the backwardness of Russia&#8217;s economic life, the surrounding highly-organised capitalist states, and the necessity for <em>industrial production</em> in Russia <em>immediately,</em> to combat the pressure of foreign industry.</p>
    <p>The agency by which the state controls industry, both labour and production, is called the Council of Workers&#8217; Control. This central body, sitting in the capital, is composed of delegates elected from local Councils of Workers&#8217; Control, which are made up of members of Factory Shop Committees, Professional Union officials, and technical engineers and experts. A central executive committee manages the affairs of each locality, composed of common workmen, but the majority is composed of <em>workmen from other districts,</em> so that its rulings shall be unprejudiced by sectional interests. The local councils recommend to the All-Russian Council the confiscation of plants, report on the needs in fuel, raw materials, transportation and labour in their districts, and assist the workmen in learning to manage the various industries. The All-Russian Council has power to confiscate plants and to equalise the economic resources of the different localities.</p>
    <p>Attached to the Council of Workers&#8217; Control is the so-called Chamber of Insurance. Workers are insured against lack of work, sickness, old age and death. <em>All premiums are paid by the employero</em>whether private person or the State. The compensation paid to the worker is always the <em>full amount of his wages.</em></p>
    <p>Under the Soviet Government the wage system is retained as a necessary accommodation to the capitalist world, the machinery to abolish it being already in place, and the whole system being under the control of the workers themselves. Lenin has clear-sightedly stated that he considers the retention of capitalist forms a step backward, a temporary defeat for the Revolution, but which must be endured until the workers are self-organized and self-disciplined enough to compete with capitalist industry.</p>
    <h4>Supreme Council of Public Economy</h4>
    <p>The tendency of the Russian Soviet Republic, as Lenin has himself pointed out, is away from political Government of any kind, and toward true industrial democracy. Lenin has even gone so far as to foresee the eventual disappearance of the Soviets in favor of an economic, purely administrative, body.</p>
    <p>The prototype of this future economic parliament already exists in Russia. It is called the Supreme Council of Public Economy, and is made up of delegates from the Main Land Committee, and from the Council of Workers&#8217; Control. This Council has the power to regulate the economic life of the country, to control the flow of production and direct it, to administer in a large way the natural resources belonging to the Government, to control export and import; and to it alone belongs the right to start new industries, or to undertake new projects of railroad and highway building, the opening of new mines, the building of new factories, or the development of water-power.</p>
    <p>The acting committee of the Council is composed of fifteen men, each one in charge of one of the fifteen branches of the country&#8217;s economic life, such as railroads, agriculture, etc. These men are chosen as follows: The different professional organizationsosuch as Institute of Mining Engineers, etc., nominate their best-qualified men; and these candidates are voted upon by the delegates of the land committees and the Workers&#8217; Control organizations.</p>
    <p>The fifteen committeemen sit in fifteen offices, surrounded by technical commissions applying to their various fields. In the same building are also representatives of the Soviets, representatives of the Commissariat of Labor, the Commissariat of Commerce and Industry, the Commissariat of Finance; representatives of the factory shop committees, the peasant Soviets, Cooperatives, etcetera.</p>
    <p>Projects are brought in. For example, let us imagine the project of a railroad between Moscow and Novgorod (there is one already, but let us imagine it). The plan is laid before the committeemen in charge of railroads. If he rejects it the project goes to an appeal board. If he accepts, he calls in his technical commissions and tells them to work out the engineering problems. Other commissions, together with representatives of the workers&#8217; organizations from the steel factories, and with the unions, work out the cost. Then the delegates of the local workers&#8217; and peasants&#8217; organizations are brought in. Do they want the railroad? Do they need it? What amount of travel will there be? What amount of traffic in fuel and raw materials and manufactured products of industry? In farm-supplies and crop-transportation?</p>
    <p>In other words, nothing is done in the way of economic development that is not needed by the people, and those things most needed by the people are done first. Since December, although Russia is racked to pieces, although she is at war with every country on earth, still vast projects are planned and work is begun upon themolike the linking of three hundred mines in the Urals with a net of railroads, and the harnessing of the six great rivers of northern Russia to furnish light, heat and industrial power.</p>
    <h4>Cooperative Russia</h4>
    <p>If it had not been for democratic organisations which existed already before the revolution, there is little doubt that the Russian revolution would have been starved to its knees long before this time.</p>
    <p>The ordinary commercial machinery of distribution had been completely smashed. Only the consumers&#8221; cooperative societies managed to feed the people, and their system has since been adopted by the municipalities, and even by the government.</p>
    <p>Before the revolution there were more than twelve million members of the cooperative societies of Russia. It is a very natural way for Russians to combine, because of its resemblance to the primitive cooperation of Russian village life for centuries.</p>
    <p>In the Putilov factory, where more than 40,000 workers are employed, the cooperative society fed, housed and <em>even clothed</em> more than 100,000 people o sending all the way to England for clothing.</p>
    <p>It is this quality in the Russians that is forgotten by people who think that Russia can have no government, because there is no central <em>force;</em> and whose mental picture of Russia is a servile committee in Moscow, bossed by Lenin and Trotsky, and maintained by Red Guard mercenaries.</p>
    <p>Quite the contrary is true. The organisations which I have described are reproduced in almost every community in Russia. And if any considerable part of Russia were seriously opposed to the Soviet government, the Soviets could not last an hour.</p>
    <p>Critics of the Soviet Government are just now crowing over Lenin&#8217;s April article in <em>Pravda,</em> translated and published here as a pamphlet, &#8220; The Soviets at Work.&#8221; In it the Great proletarian statesman tells the Russian workers that they must stop talking, stop striking, stop stealing, maintain rigid discipline and increase production. He praises the Taylor system of scientific management. He points out the inexperience and lack of education of the Russian masses, and analyzes the prevalent anarchy in industry and in agriculture. The proletariat, victorious over the bourgeoisie, must now turn its attention to the problem of &#8220;managing Russia,&#8221; without which the Revolution, must fail.</p>
    <p>What is this, cry the criticsoSocialists among themobut the application of outworn tyranny over the masses by a new set of masters? And see! Lenin himself admits that the Russians are incapable of running the dream-state they have set up....</p>
    <p>Not so. The Socialist state is not to be a return to primeval simplicity, but instead a system of society more efficient than the capitalist state. In Russia particularly the immediate task of the workers is to be able to compete with the pressure of foreign capital, as well as to supply Russia with necessities. What is true of Russia, moreover, is true of the workers of all countries. Only in no other country have the workers clear-sighted leaders like Lenin; in no other country are the workers so united and so conscious. And in Russia there are groups of industries, like the Ural mines, like the factories of Vladivostok, where Workers&#8217; Control has actually improved upon capitalist management. And do not forget that industry <em>belongs</em> to the workerso<em>is run for the profit</em> of the workers.....</p>
    <p>In June, 1918, Lenin told an American that the Russian people were not yet revolutionary. &#8220;If the masses do not become revolutionary in three months&#8217; time,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the Revolution will fail.&#8221;</p>
    <p>We know now what he meant. &#8220;Revolutionary&#8221; does not mean merely a rebellious mood; what must be destroyed must be destroyed, but the new world must be built with anxious and laborious effort.</p>
    <p>Across half the world we watch great Russia shake herself and take hold. In our ears sounds &#8220;the regular march of the iron battalions of the proletariat.&#8221;</p>
