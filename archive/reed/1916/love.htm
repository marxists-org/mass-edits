        <p>Wind smothers the snarling of the great ships,<br />
        And the serene gulls are stronger than turbines;<br />
        Mile upon mile the hiss of a stumbling wave breaks unbroken&#8212;<br />
        Yet stronger is the power of your lips for my lips.</p>
        <p>This cool green liquid death shall toss us living<br />
        Higher than high heaven and deeper than sighs&#8212;<br />
        But O the abrupt, stiff, sloping, resistless foam<br />
        Shall not forbid our taking and our giving!</p>
        <p>Life wrenched from its roots-What wretchedness!<br />
        What waving of lost tentacles like blind sea-things!<br />
        Even the still ooze beneath is quick and profound&#8212;<br />
        I am less and more than I was, you are more and less.</p>
        <p>I cried upon God last night, and God was not where I cried;<br />
        He was slipping and balancing on the thoughtless shifting planes of sea.<br />
        Careless and cruel, he will unchain the appalling sea-gray engines&#8212;<br />
        But the speech of your body to my body will not be denied!</p>
