<p class="c"><small><strong>This is the story of how the Bolsheviks helped blow up the Kaiser and then brought the last world war to an end.</strong></small></p>

<p class="c"><small><strong>It was written by John Reed, the brilliant revolutionary journalist, and author of the famous <a href="../10days/10days/index.htm" target="new"><em>Ten Days That Shook the World</em></a>, who lived through the Russian Revolution of 1917 and recorded its stirring events. In the vast socialist propaganda campaign which the Bolsheviks carried on among the Germans in occupied Russia and in Germany itself, John Reed was himself an active participant. His record of that campaign, here reprinted, originally appeared in the revolutionary magazine, <em>The Liberator</em>, in January 1919.</strong></small></p>

<p class="c"><small><strong><em>Labor Action</em> in its issue announcing this series by John Reed, published an introductory article which contrasted the behavior of the Bolsheviks of 1917 with the behavior of the Stalinists of 1942. To understand the story John Reed tells, to understand its vital significance as it relates to today, to understand it for what it actually is, an indictment of the Stalin regime written years before that regime was established, be sure to read the <a href="../../../../history/etol/newspape/laboraction-ny/1942/vol06no38/conq.htm" target="new">introduction</a> in <em>Labor Action</em> of September 21.</strong></small></p>
