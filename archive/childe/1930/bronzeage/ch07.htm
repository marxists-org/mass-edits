RACES</h3>		<p class="fst">In the last three chapters we have given a rather cursory account of the		culture of the principal communities living north of the Alps between 2000BC		and 500BC. The description of our ancestors&#8212; life in Britain towards the		latter date is rather an anticlimax after the brilliant civilisations of		Sumer, Egypt and Crete with which we started. It is salutary, if depressing, to		compare the hovels, dug in the chalk of the Wiltshire downs or built		of rubble on Dartmoor, with the great cities of Kish and Harappa that are		already two thousand five hundred years older. A single tomb on the acropolis		of Mycenae contained more gold than has been collected from thousands of		British barrows ranging over fifteen hundred years. And the Mycenaean tombs		were poverty-stricken in comparison with the Royal Graves of Ur that are		fifteen hundred years earlier. A Middle Minoan II rapier is a foot longer than		the finest bronze blade forged north of the Alps. And yet the Bronze Age		barbarians had no lack of armourers.</p>		<p>In fact, the northerners were quick to learn and adapt to their peculiar needs		those discoveries of the Ancient East that appealed to barbarian		requirements. But the techniques and models were in every case supplied by		Sumerians, Egyptians, or Minoans. In our period it is not possible to point		to a single vital contribution to material culture originating in Europe		outside the Aegean area.</p>		<p>And, if it be argued that this poverty in material culture was counterbalanced		by an inherent spiritual superiority, we can point to the cannibal		feasts of the Knoviz peoples and the human sacrifices depicted on the Kivik tombstone. Certainly Bronze Age burials suggest a monogamous family		and a high status for women. But, after all, few Orientals could actually		afford a harem, and the queens of Egypt were buried with sufficient pomp. It		would be just silly to say that Scandinavian decorative art was superior		to Babylonian or Minoan. And no one in their senses will compare the Swedish		rock-carvings with even a poor Egyptian bas- relief or the Trondholm horse		with a Sumerian bull of 3000BC.</p>		<p>No, it is not with their civilised contemporaries in the Eastern Mediterranean		that our Bronze Age ancestors must be compared but with the more		backward communities of Africa and Malaysia today.</p>		<p>Nevertheless the roots of modern European civilisation were struck down deep		into this unpromising soil. The general economic and social structure		that may be inferred from the Late Bronze Age remains persisted with		surprisingly superficial modifications throughout the Roman Period in many parts		of the Empire. The native houses and fields of Roman Britain did not differ		essentially from those of the latest Bronze Age. And after all the direct		ancestors of the Romans themselves prior to the rule of the Etruscan kings had		been just an urnfield folk comparable to the inhabitants of the Lausitz		and the Alpine slopes. Even in the British Isles many elements of pure Bronze		Age culture survived unchanged by subsequent migrations and invasions		till late in last century. For example, travellers describe beehive huts of		stone and a foot-plough, exactly like those known directly or inferred in		Bronze Age Britain, as still current in the Hebrides. Despite the upheavals of		the Early Iron Age and the Migration Period one is inclined to believe		in a considerable continuity both in blood and tradition between the Bronze Age and the modern populations.</p>		<p>Furthermore, the earliest historical data imply that the principal European		nations of antiquity must already have existed, either as distinct peoples		or at least as groups in course of formation, before the close of our period.		It should, therefore, theoretically, be possible to attach to our main		Bronze Age groups ethnic labels, derived from the classical authors. Such an		attempt is, however, rendered hazardous in practice both by the extensive		and complicated popular movements that took place during the Early Iron Age and		also by the ambiguous use of ethnic terms by the Greeks and Romans. It		is well to close this book with some account of recent speculations in this		direction, but the results up to date are frankly disappointing.</p>		<p>The &#8220;ethnic&#8221; groups considered in this search almost inevitably become		confused with the linguistic groups distinguished by comparative philologists.		Language is certainly a cultural, rather than a racial, trait and one of those		unifying factors that give to a single people that unity which might		find outward expression in a &#8220;cul- ture&#8221; (as defined in chapter II). The equation		of language and culture can, however, only possess a restricted		validity. Insofar as it is applicable, it gives us a means of supplementing		the somewhat vague testimony of ancient writers; for place names often		define very accurately the former distribution of a group or people. A		comparison of the distribution of place names of a given type with that of		archaeological remains has yielded good fruit already. This line of research		will, I believe, if the complicated problems of the Iron Age are		concomitantly unravelled, lead to the ultimate solution of our questions.</p>		<p>It is generally believed that, with the exception of the Mediterranean basin		and some corners in the extreme North and West, Europe was occupied by		peoples of Indo-European (or Aryan) speech (the great linguistic family to		which all modern European languages, except Basque, Magyar, Turkish and		Finnish, and also Armenian, Persian and Hindu belong) by the beginning of the		Bronze Age. In the Mediterranean basin place names indicate a much		longer survival of a predominantly pre-Aryan population. In the Aegean these		would be Leleges and Carians of Anatolian affinities, in Sicily and South		Italy, Sicels, and in Spain Iberian tribes whose language survives perhaps as		Basque. Beyond the borders of the European economic system to the north-east dwelt perhaps already Lapps and Finns, while it is still open to dispute		whether some early peoples in the British Isles, such as the mysterious		Picts, belonged to our linguistic ancestry at all. For the rest, Aryan		languages must have been in general use. It should therefore be possible to		connect the several Bronze Age cultures with branches of the Indo-European		linguistic family the Teutons, Kelts, Italici, Hellenes, Illyrians,		Thraco-Phrygians, and Slavs of the philologist.</p>		<p>In the case of the Teutons<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">[1]</a></sup></font> alone is there any considerable approach to		unanimity. The bronze culture of Scandinavia and North Germany is continuous		with the demonstrably Teutonic culture of the Roman period. We have even seen		that Teutonic cult practices can be traced far back in the local Bronze		Age. Though Scandinavia and North Germany were subjected to strong &#8220;influence&#8221; from the		Lausitz area in the Late Bronze Age and even stronger from the Kelts in the		Iron Age, there are no grounds for connecting these foreign influences with a		racial or even linguistic change. The only serious problem is the		attribution of certain cultures in Eastern Germany which begin in the closing		years of the Bronze Age. Kossinna has dubbed them &#8220;East Germanic&#8221;,		but the researches of one of his pupils, Petersen, have shown that they		disappear from the area in question altogether before the historical Goths are		traceable there. An identification with the Bastarnae has been suggested, but		rigorous proof is still lacking.</p>		<p>On the origin of the Kelts opinions seem at first hopelessly divided. The issue		is complicated by uncertainty as to the antiquity and significance to		be attributed to the linguistic division into Brythonic and Goidelic Kelts. The		division rests principally on the treatment of the Indo-European		guttural qu which is represented as a labial p, in Brythonic (e.g. Welsh pump		for Latin quinque) while it is preserved as a guttural c, in Goidelic		(Gaelic coic). Brythonic survives today in Welsh and Cornish and in shepherds&#8217;&#8220;counts&#8221; elsewhere in England, even in Lincolnshire. In Roman times		it was spoken by the Britons and most Gauls. Erse and Scots Gaelic, introduced		presumably by the Scotti who crossed over from Ireland in post-Roman		times, alone illustrate the Goidelic speech, although there are traces of the		same branch in the Seine valley.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">[2]</a></sup></font></p>		<p>It is quite certain that the La Tene culture of the Second Iron Age		(from about 450 BC) was created by Kelts and carried by them to Britain		and Ireland and eastward far across Central Europe. It is less certain among		which group of the Hallstatt period the La Tene culture arose and whether there were already Kelts outside the cradle		possessing a different culture. On the second question at least Great Britain		and		Ireland might be expected to afford conclusive evidence. Lord Abercromby boldly		suggested that the round-headed Beaker-folk spoke proto-Keltic, still		preserving the q sound, as in Goidelic. That would agree very well with the		views of Professor Kossinna who ascribes the Tumulus culture of		South-west Germany, that is clearly related to that of our round barrows, to		Kelts. Unfortunately as far as Britain is concerned there is no trace of		Q-Keltic speech, and Ireland was not reached by the Beaker-folk. At the same		time the recognition of a quite extensive infiltration in Late Bronze Age		times has greatly complicated the position. If two waves of Kelts are required		in Britain, the urnfield folk have as good a claim to be the first as		their round-barrow-building precursors. Correspondingly other Germans like Dr		Rademacher of Cologne have modified Kossinna's theory by making an		admixture of urnfield folk with the tumulus-builders a condition for their		becoming Kelts proper.</p>		<p>Still more recent researches have resulted in connecting the oldest strata of		Keltic place names in North Spain with a group of urnfield folk,		culturally descended from the Late Bronze Age lake-dwellers of Switzerland and		Savoy. It is thus possible to assert with some confidence that these		latter were already Keltic. It is not thereby determined whether they were the		sole Kelts nor what element in their complex ancestry urnfield folk from		the East, authors of Rhone culture and perhaps tumulus builders made their		speech Keltic. The association of urnfield folk in Britain with the system		of agriculture practised there throughout the Keltic period on the one hand and the linguistic affinity between Kelts and Italici, who were also		urnfield folk, on the other, would encourage an identification of Kelts and		North Alpine urnfield people. The chief obstacle to such an identification is		the desire to connect the North Alpine culture with Illyrians which is		mentioned below.		</p>		<p>		The position of the Italici is less difficult. There are very strong grounds		for connecting the terramaricoli with the Latini at least, and so with the		Romans. Professor Pigorini and his disciples go further, and regard the		terramaricoli as ancestors also of the Umbrians and Oscans, peoples who, like		Brythonic Kelts, changed q to p. There is indeed an almost overwhelming case for		regarding the Villanovans as Umbrians. And Professors Pigorini and		Collini have argued strongly for a derivation of the Villanovans from the		terramaricoli. Randall-MacIver would, on the other hand, invoke a second		invasion from an undefined district in Central Europe to explain the		Villanovans &#8212; a, to me, gratuitous assumption. But quite apart from this, links		between the Oscans and either the Villanovans or terramaricoli are not as yet		obvious. In particular the Oscans seem to have practised inhumation. Von		Duhn therefore has recently propounded a theory of an invasion by &#8220;inhuming		Italici&#8221; who would have occupied both Umbria and the Oscan territory &#8212; a		theory at the moment very difficult of acceptance. Personally, I regard		Pigorini's identification of the terramaricoli with the ancestors of Latins,		Umbrians and Oscans alike as the most economical and plausible theory.</p>		<p>The ancient writers often mention the Illyrians as a great nation occupying the		West Balkan highlands and parts of the Danube valley. The modern		Albanians are the sole survivors of this linguistic stock. The greater part of the Illyrian territory was occupied until the Roman conquest by		tumulus builders directly descended from the Late Bronze Age group who had		settled at Glasinac in Bosnia. A group of tumuli in Southern Italy can equally		be identified safely with the Illyrian Iapyges. The tumulus builders		practised inhumation even in the First Iron Age when elsewhere cremation		predominated. On the other hand, at the head of the Adriatic the Veneti, who		are supposed to be of Illyrian speech, were urnfield folk. This seems the sole		archaeological argument in favour of attributing to the Illyrians the		Lausitz and even the North Alpine urnfield culture &#8212; a theory that holds		indisputed sway in Germany today. From the point of view of toponymy the		doctrine is supported especially by the distribution of names containing the		allegedly Illyrian word for salt (hal) in places where the Lausitz culture		or its influence is discernible Hallstatt, Hallein, Reichenhall, Halle, Halicz		(in Galicia).</p>		<p>Against this it may reasonably be argued that we have in the regions in		question during Late Hallstatt times intrusive inhumation graves whose		furniture suggests derivation from the south-eastern slopes of the Alps. These		inhumationists may have been responsible for the introduction of the		Illyrian names in question.</p>		<p>The Thracians have a much stronger claim to the Lausitz culture. Though their		centres were in the East Balkans and Hungary, a Thracian or Dacian tribe		was to be found on the Lower Vistula as late as AD180 and left perfectly		good Dacian place names in Poland and Silesia. To them at any rate must be		ascribed the Pannonian urnfields of the latest Bronze Age in Hungary and		Transylvania, to which the Lausitz cemeteries are more or less allied. The		Late Bronze Age culture of this Tisza district, subsequently overlaid by elements contributed by Scythians		and Kelts, seems to be more or less continuous with the historical		civilisation of the Thracians of Dacia. It was also, earlier at least,		connected with the Bronze Age culture of Macedonia and intrusive, perhaps		Phrygian, elements in Asia Minor (Troy VII and perhaps earlier).<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">[3]</a></sup></font> Its		attribution to Thracians seems then certain.</p>		<p>As for the Lausitz culture, a third claimant is to be found among the Slavs.		The case for a Slavonic attribution of the Lausitz urnfields has been		strongly urged recently by several Polish scholars following in the steps of		the Czech archaeologist, Pic. The continuity has not, however, yet been		entirely demonstrated, and one suspects that political considerations are		influencing their championship of this theory as they are the strenuous		opposition of all German investigators. Still, otherwise no Slavonic nuclei		have been offered us during the Bronze Age.</p>		<p>As for the Hellenes, if they were not already south of the Balkans in		pre-Mycenaean times, we cannot identify them to the north. Two northern inroads		may indeed have reached Macedonia. The one, marked by fluted ware, started in		Hungary but was hardly on a scale to account for the Hellenisation of		Greece, besides being rather belated for that. The other, bringing inhumation		graves, spectacle brooches and antennae swords ,ought on the above view		to be connected with Illyrians.</p>		<p>The labelling of Bronze Age groups is accordingly in a very tentative and		precarious stage. In most cases a closer analysis of the cultures of the Iron		Age is indispensable. We believe that with accurate distribution maps of		leading fossils at several periods the question might be solved with almost		scientific precision. But in two key areas, France and Hungary, we are likely to have to wait long before		such maps are available. In the meanwhile Britain offers a most		promising field, and from a co-operation between archaeology and toponymy and		folklore most fruitful results are to be expected.</p>				<hr /><p class="fst"><a href="#1b" name="1">1.</a> Teutonic is the English term used to denote the whole group of allied		languages comprising Anglo-Saxon, Dutch, German, the Scandinavian tongues and		ancient Gothic.
