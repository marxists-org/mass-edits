<h3>IV. THE EARLY BRONZE AGE</h3> 
<p class="fst">The Bronze Age peoples of Europe were essentially descendants of the stocks
		inhabiting the same or adjacent parts of our continent in Neolithic
		times. These were already racially very mixed, and the rise of metallurgy may
		well have involved the incorporation of foreign artificers and miners in
		the community, as indicated in Chapter I. Commercial activity, such as
		necessarily played a prominent part in Bronze Age economics, was also
		accompanied by a certain interchange of populations, not to be confused with
		mass migrations. At the same time the dry climatic conditions prevailing
		facilitated, and in some cases perhaps even necessitated, migratory movements.
		We thus are faced, even before the beginning of the Bronze Age, with
		groups already differentiated that by no means lost their identity when they
		adopted metallurgy. On the contrary, behind the close similarities of
		bronze tools and weapons that mark the earliest Bronze Age we discern already
		great divergences in pottery, burial rites and other traits. These
		divergences soon infect the bronze industry itself. The latter is again
		differentiated according as Egyptian or Anatolian traditions predominated
		among the local artificers.</p>
		<p>In a general way it seems likely that metal first won general acceptance among
		the settled farming populations of the coasts and valleys. On the
		plateaux and plains where forests were giving way to heath and parkland flora,
		more mobile tribes mainly, though by no means exclusively, pastoral, continued for a while to content themselves
		with stone tools. Excluding the Aegean and Sicily, there are only three
		really important centres of Early Bronze Age culture in Europe, namely, Central
		Europe, South-eastern Spain and Britain, though Upper Italy may be
		added as a fourth group and the Rhone valley and Brittany were destined soon to
		join with the other regions.</p>
		<h4>CENTRAL EUROPE</h4>
		<p class="fst">
		In the valleys of the Tisza, the Middle and Upper Danube, the March, the Oder,
		the Upper Elbe and the Saale we find a series of allied communities.
		They are settled upon the great trade routes connecting the Adriatic with the
		amber of Jutland and East Prussia, and Bohemia with Slovakian copper and
		Transylvanian gold. It is convenient to designate all these kindred groups the
		Aunjetitz cultures, after a great cemetery at Unetice, south of Prague.
		There are, however, important differences between the several groups in pottery
		and to some extent also in ornaments. Strictly speaking the Aunjetitz
		culture is confined to Bohemia, Moravia, Lower Austria north of the Danube,
		Silesia and Saxo-Thuringia. On the fringe of this area there are local
		groups named respectively after Gata on the Austro-Hungarian frontier, Toszeg
		near Szolnok on the Upper Tisza, Perjamos near Arad on the Maros and
		Straubing on the Upper Danube in Lower Bavaria.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">[1]</a></sup></font></p>
		<p>All equally belong to descendants of the local Copper Age populations,
		essentially Danubian II (Lengyel) folk mixed in varying proportions with
		intruders from farther north, Anatolians and Bell-beaker folk from Spain. The
		latter had profoundly affected the industry of the region, without,
		however, leaving any appreciable trace on the physical character of the population. The metallurgy of our region
		is nonetheless on the whole inspired primarily by the Anatolian
		school, as a consideration of the pins and ear-rings at once betrays. From
		Danubian II times onwards there had been indications of Anatolian
		penetration in the pottery, Mediterranean shells and stray metal objects
		found in graves throughout the Danubian area; prospectors, perhaps from
		Troy, had discovered the gold of Transylvania and the tin of Bohemia. In the
		advanced Copper Age some ceramic groups exhibit such marked Anatolian
		features that one suspects a considerable influx of Orientals. Such would
		presumably have been extracting gold, copper and tin for export down the
		Danube to Troy, where rich bronze occurs in the second city. But when Troy II
		was sacked, the market would be closed. The strangers must produce for
		local consumption. The rise of the native Aunjetitz industry dated from that
		moment.</p>
		<p>The Aunjetitz people were of moderate stature but long-headed: they were not
		therefore descended from the exclusively round-headed Beaker folk. They
		lived primarily by farming, but undoubtedly controlled the exploitation of ore
		and the trade in amber and metals. Their dwellings were for the most
		part round beehive pits dug in the loess, but rectangular houses with plastered
		wattle walls were also built. The villages were of modest size judging
		from the cemeteries, which comprise no more than a hundred graves. The dead were
		always interred in the contracted position with the knees drawn up to
		the breast. In one case in Bohemia a megalithic kist formed the tomb.</p>
		<p>Stone and bone tools including celts (some of flint with rectangular
		cross-section as in the northern Neolithic province), hammer-axes, grooved hammer-stones, crescent-shaped
		flint sickles, bone awls and chisels, horn picks and axes, are quite
		common in the settlements. From hoards and graves we know flat and flanged
		celts (both axes and chisels) and quadrangular awls of bronze. The principal
		weapon was the flat triangular dagger with wooden or bronze hilt, but two
		bronze battleaxes with knobbed butts have been found in Bohemian graves.</p>
		<p>The pins all belong to the group with loop heads, and in particular those with
		simple roll, knot, perforated globular, racket, disk or husk heads.
		Distinctive of the Aunjetitz culture in the narrower sense is the pin with a
		cast loop surmounting an inverted conical head. In all cases the shaft is
		generally bent near the point. Except for the &#8220;manchette&#8221; armlet with engraved
		or ribbed surface, restricted to Bohemia and the immediately adjoining
		territories, the bracelets are less typical. On the other hand, the ingot
		torque (Fig. 122) is found throughout the area, as are the spiral
		lock-rings of gold or bronze like Fig. 129 and the cognate form of
		Fig. 128. Amber necklaces of two or more strings of beads
		connected by spacers are common only in Bohemia, Saxo-Thuringia and Bavaria. In
		Moravia and Lower Austria amber occurs sporadically, while none is
		reported from Hungarian graves. Tubes of rolled bronze leaf and fossil
		Dentalium shells, together with imported Cardium shells or bronze imitations
		thereof, were likewise strung together for necklaces. Little bone disks
		decorated with concentric circles may have had a similar use. Girdles of stuff
		or of multiple bronze chains were worn, and scutiform or circular plates might
		be sewn on to the former.</p>
		<p>The pottery of the whole group is very fine, well-baked and burnished, but rarely decorated. It varies in colour from orange to
		black and is often mottled like Anatolian wares. The leading form is a
		mug or jug with a loop handle attached some way below the rim. In the narrower
		Aunjetitz area it is at first pouch-shaped, having a rather
		pear-shaped body, a slightly conical neck and an everted rim (Fig. 145).<img src="fig145-152.jpg" width="276" height="268" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Cups" align="right"> The body and neck were moulded separately and then joined, a procedure
		which leaves a groove round the shoulder. Later the body is suppressed
		altogether, and we get the classical keeled mug with cavetto neck (Fig. 147), In both varieties there is a dimple in the base. The earlier pouch-shaped
		type alone is found in Bavaria and Lower Austria and recurs with rather
		longer and narrower neck and a trumpet mouth in the Hungarian Toszeg group. At
		Perjamos and Gata the distinctive type is an hour-glass mug with two
		handles descending from the brim to the belly, an essentially Anatolian type
		that began to appear even in Danubian II. An amphora is also found in
		Bohemia, but there the handles are attached to the neck below the rim.</p>
		<p>Together with the mug goes a wide dish with a groove under the broad brim (Fig.
		146). There are also a few bowls on hollow pedestals and many
		large jars or pithoi intentionally roughened on the outside. Bohemia and
		Moravia have also yielded a number of small vases that obviously imitate stone
		models, imported presumably from the Aegean. Finally, from Nienhagen on the
		northern slopes or the Harz comes a famous clay copy of a Minoan metal cup
		of the so-called Vapheio shape<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">[2]</a></sup></font>.</p>
		<p>Incised ornament when present is limited to a belt of parallel lines round the
		rim or shoulder with fillets hanging from it. In Hungary the incised
		lines are replaced by applied ribs arranged in the same way. Small nipples on
		the shoulders are found everywhere. The art of the Aunjetitz group is better illustrated by the engraved patterns
		on daggers, armlets and pinheads. It is purely rectilinear, the
		favourite motive being a small hatched triangle. On round surfaces these may be
		arranged in concentric rings. The cross is also found on some disk-head
		pins. This rigidly rectilinear style is universal throughout the Early Bronze
		Age save for the Spanish and Scottish stone carvings to be mentioned
		below. It is sometimes regarded as West European but might equally well be
		northern, since similar triangle patterns had been very common on the Corded
		Ware vases of Thuringia in the later Stone Age.</p>
		<p>In Saxo-Thuringia side by side with regular Aunjetitz graves distinguished by
		no superficial monument, we encounter interments under barrows, often
		very richly furnished. The most famous are the barrows of Leubingen and
		Helmsdorf. Both contained halberds in addition to the normal Aunjetitz armoury.
		Such barrows probably belong to descendants of the Neolithic Corded Ware folk
		of Thuringia. The halberds and a celt of English manufacture from
		Helmsdorf show that these warriors controlled trade routes leading westward as
		well as the great amber route along the Elbe. The special culture that
		was differentiated under these circumstances in the Saale valley may well be no
		earlier than Reinecke's phase B while the Aunjetitz culture proper
		occupies both phases A and B.</p>
		<p>North of Magdeburg and Glogau no burials furnished with Early Bronze Age
		types are known. But at least in Scandinavia and along the North Sea coasts
		the old Nordic population still lived on in a Stone Age, burying their dead
		either in megalithic long kists or under barrows. In a few such graves gold
		spirals of Aunjetitz types (like Fig. 129) or other stray imports have been unearthed to confirm the synchronism of this belated Stone
		Age with a precocious Bronze culture. Similarly, south of the Drave the
		so-called Slavonian culture seems to lack metal. Yet the pottery includes
		keeled mugs quite like those of Aunjetitz and Toszeg. Moreover, one group of
		Middle Bronze Age pottery from Hungary is a direct continuation of the Slavonian
		tradition.</p>
		<h4>
		UPPER ITALY</h4>
		<p class="fst">A contemporary centre of metallurgical industry in Northern Italy must be
		inferred from the distribution of certain types such as the flanged celts
		like Fig. 20. I. It is not, however, easy to locate the centre accurately.
		In the province of Brescia extensive cemeteries, notably the type site of
		Remedello, have been explored that go back to the Copper Age, in fact to the
		Bell-beaker period. Beside the narrow-shouldered West European dagger and
		others of Early Minoan form with midrib and short tang and flint copies of
		both, the graves contained round-heeled triangular daggers and even flanged
		celts, albeit of pure copper.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">[3]</a></sup></font></p>
		<p>Within the period covered by the cemeteries pile-dwellings were being founded
		on the Italian Lakes. These were occupied for a long time and have
		yielded stone tools as well as Middle and even Late Bronze Age types. But there
		are indications that some Early Bronze Age forms were actually cast in
		the lake-villages, and amber beads attest their relations with the North. It is
		supposed that the lake-dwellers were invaders from beyond the Alps
		though their precise home is uncertain. Some of the pots really resemble early
		Aunjetitz shapes, but they exhibit a curious spur or thumb-grip at the
		top of the handle that is more at home south of the Alps.</p>
		<p>The Early Bronze Age culture of Italy is, therefore, still rather vague.
		Industrially, Aegean and Spanish traditions met there, even the halberd is
		represented in hoards. Ethnically, an old native Neolithic stock was overlaid by
		Bell-beaker elements from Spain and immigrants from beyond the Alps.</p>
		<h4>SPAIN</h4>
		<p class="fst">As a centre of Early Bronze Age industry South-eastern Spain ranks in
		importance with Bohemia and even perhaps the Aegean. Here, too, it looks as if
		the rise of a local Bronze Age coincided with an interruption of relations with
		the Eastern Mediterranean, which obliged foreign metallurgists, settled
		round the rich lodes of copper and silver, to produce for a local market. The
		effects of earlier eastern trade are illustrated by the Copper Age
		settlements and cemeteries of Los Millares in Almeria and of Palmella in
		Portugal. At Los Millares the dead were buried in beehive tombs built of
		stones and roofed by corbelling. Similar, but sometimes even finer, tombs are
		known from Granada, Andalucia and Southern Portugal. The tombs at
		Palmella are similarly shaped, but hewn out of the rock. Both types seem to be
		derived from the Eastern Mediterranean. That is confirmed by the
		discovery at Los Millares of ostrich-shell beads, pins of hippopotamus-ivory,
		vases of stone and plaster, painted pottery and bone combs, as well as
		flat celts, West European daggers, saws, arrowheads and other copper
		implements. With the Oriental imports are found also Baltic amber, English jet
		and French callais. The pottery in all the above-mentioned tombs includes
		Beaker ware mingled with undecorated local vases sometimes of Early Minoan or
		Cycladic form.</p>
		<p>Siret<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">[4]</a></sup></font> believes that these rich tombs belonged to Oriental colonists
		who had founded trading-posts at points commanding the sea route to the
		North and the local supplies of ore. He insists that the rarity of gold and
		silver at this time is due to the fact that the precious metals were
		exported to the Ancient East and the Aegean, just as in Denmark, when in Late
		Neolithic times the amber trade with Bohemia was established, that
		substance, formerly common in every tomb, ceased to figure in the grave
		inventory. In the Bronze Age culture that succeeded that of Los Millares, silver
		became relatively common and foreign imports correspondingly rare, as might be
		inferred on the assumption of the interruption of eastern trade.</p>
		<p>The chief centre of Early Bronze Age civilisation lay in Almeria, the type
		station being El Argar in that province.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">[5]</a></sup></font> The same culture spread all
		along the east coast of the Peninsula to the Pyrenees and is traceable, though
		in an impoverished form, in Andalucia and Southern Portugal.</p>
		<p>Physically the Bronze Age population of South-eastern Spain was mixed. Among
		the males long-heads and round-heads were represented in approximately
		equal proportions; the women on the other hand were predominantly
		brachycephalic.</p>
		<p>The El Argar folk were certainly farmers and as surely also metallurgists.
		Moulds, grooved hammer-stones and slag have turned up in several
		settlements. The people doubtless exploited the local copper and silver ores,
		but the supply of tin which had to be imported from Galicia, the
		Cevennes, Brittany or Cornwall was irregular. None of the tools analysed
		contained as much as ten per cent, and the majority consist of unalloyed
		copper. In Almeria the El Argar people lived on hilltops defended by great stone walls, sometimes pierced by a
		postern reminiscent of Mycenae. The houses were agglomerations of
		rectangular chambers with stone foundations for the walls. Some may have
		boasted two storeys. The dead were buried, contracted, within the settlements,
		among or under the houses, either in small kists of six thin slabs or in large
		jars. Some sarcophagi, hollowed out of stone, are also assigned to this
		period. Against a wall in one village was an altar-like construction
		embellished with horn-like ends suggesting a well-known Minoan cult object, the
		horns of consecration.</p>
		<p>The principal tools are celts, flat or with low flanges, and quadrangular awls.
		As weapons were employed round-heeled knife-daggers, halberds and the
		bow and arrows. The daggers, as in the Cyclades, were not seldom attached to
		the hilts by small silver rivets. As noted, the daggers eventually grew
		into short flat swords. The halberd, the most distinctive weapon of the peninsula, is already foreshadowed by flint blades from Los Millares and
		contemporary sites. The bronze specimens vary widely in shape: most are
		symmetrical, some have very broad butts, the rivets may be quite big and a
		broad midrib is frequently used to strengthen the blade. The arrows were tipped
		with tanged copper heads, generally lozenge-shaped and seldom barbed.
		The type goes back to the Copper Age culture of Los Millares. Narrow plaques of
		schist, perforated at either end, were probably worn on the wrist by
		archers as a protection against the recoil of the bow-string. Elsewhere such
		wrist-guards are found in graves with Bell-beakers.</p>
		<p>The ornaments are dull in comparison with the Bohemian. The most interesting is
		a diadem, an open circlet of silver or sheet copper, shaped so as to
		leave an upright projection in front. Plain rings of silver or bronze wire were worn
		on the arms and fingers and in the ears. Another ornament for the arm
		or neck was made from a boar&#8217;s tusk perforated with a series of holes through
		which small copper rings were stuck. Beads of rolled copper leaf or
		coiled wire together with shells were hung on necklaces. There are also a few
		imported beads of callais, segmented beads of Minoan or Egyptian faience
		and imitations thereof in bone. Pyramidal bone buttons with V perforation
		served to fasten the garments.</p>
		<p>The El Argar pottery, like that of Aunjetitz, is normally unornamented and red,
		black or mottled. Handles are virtually unknown, nor is the base ever
		dimpled; rounded bottoms are indeed common. The main forms are goblets with
		inverted rims on a solid pedestal (Fig. 149), dishes with similar
		rims, big carinated bowls with flattened conical necks (Fig. 148), and
		keeled mugs with cavetto necks (Fig. 150). The latter closely
		resemble the Aunjetitz form in profile, but never have handles. Such parallels
		need imply no direct connection; they are rather developments of Copper
		Age types in which North African and Aegean elements were prominent, and some
		of which reached Central Europe along with the Bell-beaker culture.</p>
		<p>In the East Spanish cradle of the El Argar culture, so rich in artistic
		production of the Stone and Copper Ages, no indications of decorative activity
		assignable to the Bronze Age have come to light. But in the North-west
		(Northern Portugal, Galicia and the Pyrenees), where isolated bronzes of El
		Argar form and traces of contemporary mining have come to light, two curious
		series of rock-carvings exist that may be described here. The first and
		older group is a degenerate descendant of the well-known Copper Age group described by Burkitt.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">[6]</a></sup></font> Its
		patterns seem to represent yet more conventionalised versions of the human
		figure. The body has become a rectangle or three concentric circles round a
		central dot. The head is denoted by a vertical line starting from the
		periphery and sometimes terminating in a circle or a cross. A pair of short
		oblique strokes, sprouting from the upper corners of the rectangles or the
		appropriate cords of the circles may be added to represent arms, and legs may
		be similarly indicated (Fig. 153). Some of these figures may stand
		for the four-wheeled carts depicted on the Copper Age monuments.</p>
		<p>In a later group conventionalisation had proceeded even farther. Of the old
		figures nothing now remains but circles sometimes traversed by a radial
		line and enclosing a round hollow, termed a cup mark (Fig. 153), or a
		group of such. But mixed up with these geometric figures on some rocks are
		highly conventionalised but quite recognisable animals, carved in the same
		technique. Apart from these animal figures the later <a href="#carvings" name="carvingsb">Galician rock carvings</a> offer most interesting parallels to the &#8220;cup and ring&#8221; markings
		of the British Isles. They thus supplement the evidence afforded by beads
		and tools for the continuance of those ancient trade relations along the
		Atlantic coasts of which the distribution of megalithic tombs give proof in
		the Stone Age.</p>
		<p>Settlements and cemeteries of classical El Argar type are common only along the
		east coast of the peninsula from the Ebro to Gibraltar. In Portugal El
		Argar types occur principally in the late degenerate forms of the local
		megalithic tombs. The same remark applies to the Pyrenaean region where a local
		megalithic culture evolved in the Copper Age out of a fusion of Portuguese, Bell-beaker and local Neolithic elements, now accepted some El
		Argar types of tool and pottery. In time the range of the El Argar culture
		may be considerable. It must begin quite early in the second millennium BC,
		yet, at least in its homeland, it has no successor till the Iron Age.</p>
		<img src="fig153-155.jpg" width="322" height="468" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Rock carvings, kist coverstone, slab from tomb" align="right"><p>Apart from the limited adoption of El Argar types in the south, it seems that
		the natives of France were incapable of fulfilling the conditions
		requisite for regular supplies of metal. Though isolated bronzes of early type
		are widespread, burials furnished with such are confined to the
		north-west corner and the extreme east (Savoy and Jura). The negative evidence
		is supplemented by the discovery of a few Bronze Age trinkets among
		Neolithic or Copper Age grave goods in the stone kists of the Cevennes or the
		allees couvertes of the Seine-Oise-Marne basins.</p>
		<p>In Normandy and Brittany on the other hand a series of tombs furnished with
		Early Bronze Age types testifies to a vigorous though belated metal
		industry. The Armorican culture probably belongs rather to the Middle Bronze
		Age, like that of the Rhone, and so does not rank as an original centre of
		metallurgy, but it is nonetheless more convenient to mention it here at the
		expense of chronological exactitude. The Bronze Age graves lie
		conspicuously outside the areas where the famous megalithic tombs are
		concentrated. They seem to denote a new and probably intrusive culture. The
		tombs are generally chambers built of small stones not bonded with any mortar and
		roofed either with a single large capstone or with a corbelled vault. The
		whole structure was buried beneath a mound or cairn. Usually no passage
		connected the chamber with the exterior of the cairn, but some tombs with a
		corridor of access in Normandy may belong to this period. The tombs were designed for one interment
		only, and in most cases the body had been burned, though inhumations
		occur.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">[7]</a></sup></font></p>
		<p>The furniture includes flat celts and round-heeled daggers<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">[8]</a></sup></font> of bronze and
		superb tanged and barbed arrowheads of flint. One wooden dagger-hilt had
		been studded with 1333 little gold nails; other daggers are bronze hilted.
		Wrist-guards for the bowman have been found but rarely. Among the ornaments
		may be mentioned a ring-head pin of silver and rare beads of amber or
		vitreous paste.</p>
		<p>A curious vase regularly accompanies these burials. It is strictly biconical
		though the upper cone is shorter and more depressed than the lower one.
		Two or four wide strap handles unite the rim to the keel where the two cones
		join. The vases may be decorated with herringbone incisions or with rows
		of hatched triangles along the keel and base and the same inverted below the
		keel and along the rim. This is the same style of decoration that we find
		generally on bronzes and gold ornaments throughout the Early Bronze Age. The
		origin of this culture is at the moment unknown.</p>
		<p>The Early Bronze Age cultures in Savoy and Eastern France are chiefly
		represented by burials under barrows, which may still contain stone axes (celts)
		together with bronze offerings. They are inspired partly from Bohemia and
		Hungary like the Rhone culture of the Middle Bronze Age.</p>
		<p>At the close of the Neolithic Age the dominant folk on both sides of the Rhine
		possessed the culture termed by Burkitt &#8220;Pile-dwelling&#8221;. They dwelt in fortified settlements. At the same
		time part of the country was overrun by Corded Ware makers from farther
		east and the Bell-beaker folk from the West. Mixed communities arose under
		these conditions. From an amalgamation between the two intrusive groups
		sprang the so-called Zoned-beaker group. This people already possessed
		round-heeled daggers of true Bronze Age type. A large proportion of them went
		downstream and settled in Britain, as we shall see below.</p>
		<p>In the Rhineland itself, however, a kindred group, including more Pile-dwelling
		elements, remained behind and created the Adlerberg culture, so called
		after a village and cemetery on a knoll of that name on the outskirts of Worms.
		The huts were pit-dwellings, partly sunk in the earth, and the graves,
		situated among the huts, each contained a contracted corpse. Round-heads were
		predominant in the population. The grave goods are poor and primitive
		rare flat celts, round-heeled flat daggers and quadrangular awls of bronze, and
		pins with broad rolled heads and a shaft bent like a sabre. The latter
		type was also imitated in bone. The graves also yielded flint knives and
		arrowheads, bone and allegedly ivory rings, and beads and shells, including
		Mediterranean species, pierced for stringing.</p>
		<p>The commonest pot is a rather biconical or pear-shaped mug with ribbon
		handles that may be decorated with rows of incised triangles like the
		Armorican vases.</p>
		<h4>GREAT BRITAIN</h4>
		<p>The round-headed Beaker folk who descended the Rhine settled in Great Britain,
		introducing there their own habit of individual burial under a round
		barrow in contrast to the collective interments under a long barrow practised by the supposedly older &#8220;Neolithic&#8221; long-heads. Naturally the
		invaders from the East did not exterminate the older population. The latter
		continued to bury their dead for a time in the family vaults under long
		barrows, and, though the round barrow eventually became universal, probably
		ended by absorbing the intruders. They at any rate played a part in the
		development of the bronze industry. Yet the oldest metal objects in Britain
		have been found under round barrows and with beakers. Though flint and stone
		are far commoner than metal with such pottery, the Beaker folk probably
		introduced the knowledge of metallurgy or the organising ability needed to make
		that knowledge effective; the establishment of the necessary
		organisation naturally took time for invaders in a strange country.</p>
		<p>Our knowledge of the British Bronze Age being founded in a peculiar degree upon
		a study of the funerary pottery and associated grave goods, our account
		of it must begin with a description of the main types. The beakers<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">[9]</a></sup></font> that
		symbolise the invaders have been divided into three main classes by
		Thurnam and Abercromby, denoted by the letters A, B, and C most unhappily
		since, while the A and C beakers are closely allied, the B beakers are placed
		in a class apart by ornament and associations as well as by form.
		</p>
		<p>
		Beakers of class B stand nearest to the continental varieties. The rims are
		everted and the profile forms a graceful reversed S curve down to the base. The clay
		is fine, often red and generally burnished. The ornament is arranged in
		predominantly horizontal zones, as a rule alternately plain and decorated. The
		patterns, repeated round the zones, are quite simple chevrons, triangles, Xs.
		The decoration was executed either with a cog-wheel or short-toothed
		comb of bone or wood whose square teeth, rolled over the wet clay, have left an almost
		continuous series of little rectangular depressions, or (in North Britain)
		with a cord impressed upon the damp clay or finally with a simple pointed
		implement. Beakers of this type are found all over the island. They are
		regularly associated with bronze, or perhaps copper, daggers of West European
		type (Fig. 41), barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, stone
		wrist-guards and buttons with V-perforation, but never with objects of Nordic
		type (stone battleaxes or flint daggers).</p>
		<p>Beakers of types A and C bear a close family likeness. The neck is practically
		straight or even inturned at the rim and makes a definite angle with the
		globular body instead of rising out of it in a continuous swelling curve. In
		type A the neck is relatively long in comparison with the body while in C
		it is shorter. These beakers exhibit a greater variety of ornament than those
		of class B. The arrangement is no longer exclusively horizontal; a
		division into panels or metopes is common, and occasionally vertical bands
		predominate. The patterns include saltires, elongated triangles and lozenges. Cord-impression is not employed, but in addition to the remaining devices
		applied to the decoration of B beakers, we have the imprint of
		fingernails and of a hollow reed or bird's legbone. In type C horizontal
		ridges in relief may be used decoratively. In the same class are to be
		included a small group of beakers with handles. Such appendages are foreign to
		the pure bell-beakers of Western Europe, but are not rare in Bavaria and
		farther east. With beakers of types A and C are associated flat round-heeled
		daggers with rivets for the handle (Fig. 42), flint daggers, stone
		battleaxes and flint arrowheads.</p>
		<p>Lord Abercromby<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#10" name="10b">[10]</a></sup></font> believed that the Beaker folk landed at one
		point on our coasts, probably in Kent, and spread gradually northwards.
		The gradual degeneration of type A would provide a time scale for checking
		their advance. The theory of a single landing place is now generally
		rejected, and class B beakers must be excluded from the typological series as a
		group apart. On the other hand, the C beakers, which may well be
		decadent descendants of the A group, are really commonest in North Britain, So
		the people who made them may in truth have spread northwards by land
		routes rather as Abercromby imagined.</p>
		<p>Partly, at least, contemporary with the beaker burials are others, accompanied
		by a quite unrelated vase termed a food vessel. This was the funerary
		pot of the &#8220;Neolithic&#8221; stock and originated in North Britain or Ireland out of a
		bowl found in the long barrows and contemporary settlements. The
		allegedly Neolithic bowls were round-bottomed so that food vessels showing this
		peculiarity may be regarded as early. Such are lotus-shaped with
		ornament even on the base; they are termed type A by Abercromby. Very soon the
		base was flattened and a groove developed round the widest part of the
		body. As a further development, or more probably as a derivative
		of another variety of &#8220;Neolithic&#8221; bowl, the part above the grooves was
		contracted somewhat to form a slightly concave neck, the groove being now in a
		well-marked shoulder. The classical types of England are a modification of this. The lower part is an inverted truncated cone; above this comes a
		marked shoulder bearing one (types 1 and 2) (Fig. 151) or two
		(type 4) grooves or none at all (type 3). The shoulder is surmounted by a short
		concave neck. In all food vessels the rim is broad and moulded, generally on the inside.</p>
		<p>Food vessels, especially in North Britain and Ireland, are very richly
		decorated. The cog-wheel technique, distinctive of Beaker ornament, is indeed
		comparatively rare on food vessels south of Derbyshire, while cord impressions
		are exceptional farther north. On the other hand, three methods of
		ornamentation strange to beakers were freely employed on food vessels in
		Ireland and Western Scotland, but grow progressively rarer as we proceed
		southward in England. They are termed by Abercromby the whipped-cord, the
		looped-cord and the false-relief techniques respectively.</p>
		<p>In the first a cord, twisted tightly round a pin or other thin core, is
		impressed upon the damp clay, a style of decoration known also on &#8220;Neolithic&#8221;
		pottery in Scotland. The looped-cord effect may be obtained by twisting two
		cords together to form a braid which is impressed upon the clay, then
		unwinding the braid and forming a new one with the cords twisted in the
		opposite direction. The false relief is obtained by impressing on the soft clay
		a bone or wooden implement with a triangular point like that of a penknife so
		as to produce a series of triangles whose bases form a continuous line.
		The process is repeated with the point of the instrument inverted so as to
		yield a second series of triangles whose bases shall be parallel to those of
		the first but whose apices point to the junction of the bases of the first
		series. A zig-zag band is thus left in relief between the two sets of
		inverted triangles. Sometimes an actual triangular stamp of wood
		may have been employed. And in any case the effect is similar to that
		of the fretwork technique on Central European pottery described in the next
		chapter. It is already seen on some true bell-beakers from North Spain and Central Europe.</p>
		<p>Though covered with patterns, food vessels seldom exhibit such distinctive
		motives as are seen on beakers of class A. We may, however, draw attention
		to the radial cruciform or stellate patterns on the bases of some Irish and
		Scottish examples. They distinctly recall the patterns radiating from the
		bases of vases of the bell-beaker class in Spain and Portugal.</p>
		<p>The food vessels of early type are found principally in Ireland and the more
		mountainous northern and western portions of Great Britain. In Southern
		England funerary vases of this group are quite rare, and all belong to late or
		degenerate types. Food vessels, in fact, doubtless belong to the
		&#8220;Neolithic&#8221; stock, dispossessed in the south by the Beaker folk. Nevertheless
		fresh arrivals from the south-west, whence the &#8220;Neolithic&#8221; people had
		presumably come, are highly probable. A reinforcement of Spanish influence is
		demonstrated by the radial decoration mentioned above as well as by the
		contemporary halberds, the chambered tumuli of the type of New Grange, the
		carvings on stones there and elsewhere and other cognate phenomena.</p>
		<p>With food vessels are associated flat triangular daggers, celts and awls of
		bronze, flint arrowheads and stone battleaxes, but no wrist-guards or
		flint daggers and very few buttons with V-perforation. The skulls of corpses
		interred with food vessels, like those from the &#8220;Neolithic&#8221; long
		barrows, are quite often long-headed in contrast to the pronounced
		round-headedness of the Beaker folk. Moreover, in some instances food vessels
		accompany cremated interments and may even contain the ashes.</p>
		<p>To adapt them better to the function of ossuaries, the food vessels were
		eventually greatly enlarged, becoming what are termed cinerary urns. The
		general adoption of cremation, signalised by the appearance of the cinerary
		urn, may be conveniently taken to mark the beginning of the Middle Bronze
		Age here, although no corresponding changes in the buried bronze offerings can
		be detected. And it must be noted that even beakers were in use side by
		side with early cineraries.</p>
		<p>Sharply defined cultural groups are not distinguishable in Great Britain till
		the Late Bronze Age, but even in our period we can discern the working
		of a principle, recently enunciated by Dr Fox.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#11" name="11b">[11]</a></sup></font> In the predominantly
		lowland area south-east of a line from Teesmouth to Torquay foreign cultures
		of continental origin tend to be imposed; in the highland country to the
		north-west such tend to be absorbed. In our period the Beaker culture
		maintained itself for a long time in the south; in the north the native Bronze
		culture characterised by food vessels soon developed and superseded it.
		Two overlapping phases of the British Early Bronze Age are thus obvious; the
		first, marked by the earlier types of beakers, witnessed the arrival and
		expansion of the round-headed invaders; during the second the older population,
		distinguished by the food vessels, reasserted itself. Thanks to the
		blending of two traditions the native civilisation of the British Isles during
		these two periods was vigorous and original.
		</p>
		<p>
		While they undoubtedly cultivated grains and engaged in trade and industry,
		our Bronze Age ancestors were semi-nomadic. As Dr Curwen<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#12" name="12b">[12]</a></sup></font> puts it
		&#8220;like the patriarch Isaac who &#8216;sowed in that land and found in the same year an
		hundredfold ... and departed thence&#8217; our Bronze Age ancestors inhabited
		a site from one to five years until the cornplots were exhausted and then moved elsewhere&#8221;. No
		large villages have been found, and the earlier burials do not
		constitute regular cemeteries. A few fortified enclosures on hilltops were
		certainly occupied by the Beaker folk, but their foundation dates from an
		earlier age. The defences, of which Windmill Hill near Avebury offers the
		typical example, consisted of concentric moats interrupted by frequent
		causeways.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#13" name="13b">[13]</a></sup></font></p>
		<p>The dwellings of the period were mainly circular. In England the hut was
		excavated in the chalky ground and completed probably by a conical roof of
		skins. In Scotland beaker sherds have been found in &#8220;hut-circles&#8221; of which
		the foundation only, a circular bank of stones and turf, survives; the
		nature of the superstructure is unknown. In one near Muirkirk in Ayrshire<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#14" name="14b">[14]</a></sup></font>
		a post-hole was observed near the centre as well as a large hole
		full of ashes and cracked stones that served as a cooking-pit. Such hut-circles
		are scattered all over the moors throughout the British Isles and are
		easily seen when the heather is not too high. In all a gap in the circular
		bank, often flanked by great stones, marks the doorway. In some later huts
		(Late Bronze Age) on Dartmoor<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#15" name="15b">[15]</a></sup></font> the megalithic jambs and the stone lintel
		above them are still in position. These show that by the Late Bronze Age
		at least the hut with low narrow doorway (2 feet 9 inches wide by 3 feet 9
		inches high) was already well established. Sometimes the door opens on to a
		low narrow passage, often bent in an elbow. A comparison with the snow huts of
		the Esquimaux suggests that these features were designed to exclude
		currents of cold air. The superstition about draughts that makes railway
		travelling so painful even now is clearly very old. The inhabitants of
		hut-circles seem to have enjoyed the odorous warmth of human bodies clustered about a
		reeking fire as much as their Arctic representatives. The stone hut-circle,
		with its analogues in the beehive tomb, is an Atlantic-Mediterranean device
		inherited from the old &#8220;Neolithic&#8221; stock in Britain, but it continued to
		grow into even more elaborate forms during the Iron Age.
		</p>
		<p>
		Hut-circles generally occur in little groups, evidently tiny hamlets of from
		four to twelve families. Adjacent to some groups, for instance on Dartmoor
		and on Spartleton Edge in the Lammermoors, remains of irregular enclosures,
		fenced by dry walls of stone, are noticeable. They may denote the cornplots
		of the semi-nomadic villagers.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#16" name="16b">[16]</a></sup></font>
		</p>
		<p>
		Nearly all Early Bronze Age burials have been marked externally by a mound of
		earth or a cairn of stones. But the barrows and the grave beneath them
		vary considerably in structure. The simplest form of barrow is a roughly
		circular mound; from their external appearance such tumuli are termed &#8220;bowl
		barrows&#8221;. The base of the mound is sometimes surrounded with a ring of large
		stones, technically called a peristalith, that served to keep the material
		of the tumulus in place. Occasionally such a ring of stones or a circular
		trench dug in the virgin soil encircles the grave but is completely buried by
		the mass of the barrow. Very close attention is therefore needed during the
		excavation of even a simple bowl barrow to disclose these and other
		possible structural features. A more elaborate monument is the so-called &#8220;bell barrow&#8221;. Here the mound is surrounded by a ditch or fosse with a
		bank outside it; a narrow belt of level ground, known as the berm, generally
		intervenes between the inner lip of the encircling fosse and the base of
		the mound proper. Some gigantic tumuli, covering built chambers, such as the
		celebrated Maes Howe in Orkney, could be classed as bell barrows though
		some believe them to be Neolithic rather than Bronze Age. In a third type,
		christened the &#8220;disk barrow&#8221;, the central eminence has virtually
		disappeared; we have, that is, an immense berm encircled by fosse and rampart.
		Such are supposed to be late in the Early Bronze Age; disks are
		generally earlier.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#17" name="17b">[17]</a></sup></font>
		</p>
		<p>
		The normal grave of the Beaker people was a simple trench or, in hard country,
		a short kist built of six stone slabs at the centre of the barrow. In
		Ireland and Northern and Western Scotland some round cairns which covered
		circular or more often cruciform chambers, roofed by corbelling, are still
		assigned to the Bronze Age. Such chambered cairns are clearly connected with
		the old long barrows that covered similar chambers. And it must be
		remembered that Early Bronze Age pottery, principally Beaker ware, has been
		found in quite a number of long barrows, showing that such family vaults
		were still in use when the Beaker folk reached our shores.</p>
		<p>&#8220;The standing stones on the naked wine red moor are a feature of British
		highland scenery scarcely less impressive than the grandeur of their setting.
		Mr Burkitt<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#18" name="18b">[18]</a></sup></font> has already described the principal characters of menhirs,
		alignments and cromlechs as well as Stonehenge,<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#19" name="19b">[19]</a></sup></font> but a few additional
		words on the stone circles are indispensable to any account of the Bronze Age
		in Great Britain. It has been suggested that the stone circle developed
		out of the peristalith of a cairn or from the buried setting under one.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#20" name="20b">[20]</a></sup></font> At
		Clava near Inverness we actually find circles of huge upright stones
		enclosing the chambered cairns, and at Callernish in Lewis a similar ring of
		uprights encloses a chambered tumulus but just touches its periphery. Our stone circles vary widely in
		character and doubtless also in date and function. All consist of upright
		stones placed so as to form a ring, but the number, size and arrangement of
		the stones are variable. There are circles whose stones barely emerge
		above the surface of the ground and others like Avebury (Wilts), consisting of
		stupendous blocks of stone. Some large circles are surrounded by a
		fosse and bank like the Rings of Brodgar (no bank) and Stennis in Orkney, Arbor
		Low in Derbyshire and of course Stonehenge itself and Avebury. The
		diameter between the stones of Brodgar is 340 feet. A much smaller example of a
		similar type (without bank) is to be seen at the Broomend of Crichie
		near Inverarie with a diameter of only 38 feet. Its six pillars surround a
		central burial kist. In a specialised group, confined to Aberdeenshire, the
		uprights increase in height progressively throughout a semicircle, and a huge
		horizontal slab, termed the recumbent, lies between the two highest
		which are of course adjacent. Some circles at least were sepulchral. For
		example, a kist containing a food vessel was found so precisely in the centre
		of a circle on Mauchrum Moor on the west coast of Arran that grave and circle
		must have been conceived as a single monument. The food vessel
		incidentally fixes the Early Bronze Age date of this circle at least. But
		others may be later in date and need not have been connected with any
		burials. Sometimes two circles are closely juxtaposed as in the famous Grey
		Wethers on Dartmoor.
		</p>
		<p>
		Near many stone circles stands a single upright termed the outlier. Such are
		attached to all sorts of circles in all parts of the country, e.g. to the
		fossed Ring of Brodgar in Orkney, to most Aberdeenshire circles, to the small
		ring termed the Rollright Stones in Oxfordshire, etc. Outliers furnish one of the principal arguments to those who
		believe the circles to have been astronomical. The outlier would be a
		pointer to mark some celestial event viewed from the centre at a stated season
		of the year. Unfortunately in quite a number of cases the only possible
		phenomena to which many of these outliers might have been orientated prove to
		be of such an inconspicuous nature that they are unlikely to have
		attracted attention in our clouded heavens. Indeed it is fantastic to imagine
		that the ill-clad inhabitants of these boreal isles should shiver night-long in rain and gale, peering through the driving mists to note eclipses and
		planetary movements in our oft-veiled skies.</p>
		<p>The cover-stones of certain Scottish kists containing food vessels or beakers
		exhibit a curious carved decoration, and allied patterns can be seen on
		the stones of the peristaliths and chambers of the famous chambered tumuli at
		New Grange and Lough Crew in Ireland. Here Professor Breuil has been able
		to distinguish four series.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#21" name="21b">[21]</a></sup></font> The first, simple engraved lines, and the
		second, consisting of spirals and other curvilinear figures executed by
		pocking, are anterior to the building of the tumuli, which partly hide the
		markings. Subsequently other patterns &#8212; lozenges and diapers &#8212; pocked all over,
		were squeezed into the spaces left by the earlier figures. Designs of the same
		series, Breuil's group IV, recur together with spirals, on the underside
		of the stone covering a kist containing a beaker at Carnwath in Lanarkshire
		(Fig. 154). Between these limits fall a large series of patterns,
		allied in design and technique to group II but executed on living rock surfaces
		in Southern Scotland and Northern England. The commonest device here
		is the &#8220;cup-and-ring marking&#8221;: a shallow depression, 1-2 inches in diameter
		hammered out in the rock surface, is surrounded by from one to eight concentric circles,
		pocked out; a groove often runs from the centre to just beyond the
		outermost circle (cf. Fig. 153). Cognate curvilinear patterns, showing
		very clearly the motive of a pair of human eyes that is just discernible
		at New Grange, are carved on a chalk drum found under an Early Bronze Age
		barrow at Folkton in Yorkshire. Probably in all these carvings we have very
		conventionalised versions of the human figure or parts thereof and perhaps of
		ritual objects such as bull-roarers. The peculiarity of the group lies in
		the use of curvilinear motives that are otherwise foreign to the Bronze Age art
		of Europe except at a later date in Scandinavia and Hungary. The
		spirals have been interpreted as due to Mycenaean influence. In any case the
		carvings do indicate very close connections with the South-west. The
		spirals of New Grange have parallels, which cannot be accidental, on the walls
		of the great passage grave of Gavr&#8217;inis, Brittany. The cup-and-ring
		markings exhibit no less significant similarities to the <a href="#carvingsb" name="carvings">Galician rock carvings</a>
		mentioned previously. These carvings can hardly be merely decorative. As we
		have no insight into their inner function and significance, we mask our
		ignorance by calling them religious or magical.
		</p>
		<p>
		The purely decorative art of our Early Bronze Age is illustrated on the pottery
		already discussed and on the weapons and ornaments. Of the latter the
		most striking are the gold lunulae and jet necklaces described in Chapter III.
		All show the strictly rectilinear patterns of triangles and similar
		motives usual everywhere at the period, engraved in the case of bronzes and
		lunulae and punctured on the jet beads.
		</p>
		<p>
		The main types of tools and weapons in use have already been sufficiently
		summarised in dealing with the grave goods associated with beakers and food vessels. The only important
		addition to the list, given by a study of the few hoards assignable to the
		period, is the halberd that was, as noted in Chapter III, very common in
		Ireland. It must again be insisted that flint was very freely used, not only
		for arrowheads but also for all sorts of knives and scrapers, and polished
		stone celts, as well as battleaxes, were still current. Yet copper or
		bronze flat celts were manufactured locally. Moulds for casting such have
		turned up in Scotland to an extent unsurpassed anywhere on the continent
		outside South-eastern Spain, and the distribution of actual specimens
		coincides fairly closely with that of Early Bronze Age settlement as disclosed
		by Beaker burials. On the other hand, Dr Fox<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#22" name="22b">[22]</a></sup></font> contends that the bronze
		knife-daggers were imported from the South by sea. They are certainly
		concentrated in South-western England and become disproportionately rarer to
		the east and north. Commercial or other connections with the Iberian
		Peninsula were certainly close during the period. And a dagger whose wooden
		hilt was decorated with tiny gold nails affords a link with contemporary
		Brittany. At the same time contact with the lands across the North Sea is
		illustrated by the amber necklaces and flint daggers of Scandinavian type as
		well as by beads in the form of a double-axe a well-known &#8220;Neolithic&#8221;  type in
		Denmark.</p>
		<p>Thus three currents met in England during the Early Bronze Age: one from Central
		Europe represented by the invading Beaker folk, another from the
		Iberian Peninsula, perhaps unconnected with popular movement, and a third,
		plainly mercantile, from Scandinavian countries. That explains the intense
		vigour and originality of our Bronze Age civilisation.</p>
