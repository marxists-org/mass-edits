<h3>VI. THE LATE BRONZE AGE</h3>
		<p class="fst">In contrast to the apparent peace and prosperity of the preceding period,
		the Late Bronze Age was an epoch of turmoil and migration, though it
		witnessed immense industrial and economic progress, forced upon the barbarians
		by these times of stress. The growth of population in the tranquil
		centuries of the Middle Bronze Age among peoples who had not yet settled down
		to the laborious methods of really sedentary cultivation resulted for the
		first time in a genuine pressure and congestion on the land. Climatic conditions &#8212; intensified drought, followed ultimately by a return to moister and
		colder conditions that favoured the spread of forest at the expense of pastures &#8212;
		may have aggravated the land hunger in individual areas. The cumulative
		effect of these factors was to produce a bitter struggle for the fertile
		valleys in Central Europe and the uprooting of small hordes. The regime of
		bloody tribal wars, later described so grimly in the pages of Tacitus and
		profitable only to the Roman slave-dealer, had already been inaugurated. The
		repercussions of the turmoil reached Britain on the one hand and the East
		Mediterranean coast on the other, there to be complicated by events in Asia
		that still elude our ken. But the Mycenaean civilisation collapsed under
		barbarian pressure, and northerners overran Anatolia, threatening the Egyptian
		and Hittite Empires.</p>
		<p>These latter disturbances hampered mining and metallurgy in Asia Minor. And
		Assyrian military requisitions and monopolistic control of ores further restricted the supply. At the same time the state of universal war increased
		the demand to unprecedented proportions. In continental Europe we witness
		not only the struggle for land but also one for the control of ores,
		accompanied by a great intensification of mining activities and the growth of a
		trade in scrap-metal, marked by the so-called founders&#8217; hoards. In Hither Asia
		the contest for booty was equally accompanied by a quest for new
		supplies of metal. The merchants and craftsmen of Phoenicia in particular, cut
		off by barbarian inroads and Assyrian monopolies from local supplies,
		sought compensations in the West. As at the beginning of the Age of Metals,
		fresh bands of prospectors sailed from the Eastern Mediterranean, combining
		kidnapping and piracy with legitimate trade as the <i>Odyssey</i> so brightly
		indicates. Their activities helped to introduce to the western world the secret
		of the new metal, iron, and a whole series of new types and processes.</p>
		<p>Yet the westward tracks of Oriental traders crossed paths already furrowed at
		an earlier date by pirate galleys from the West Mediterranean isles. The
		raiders whose descents on the Oriental empires are such a feature of the
		thirteenth and twelfth centuries before our era may, when finally repulsed,
		have carried with them westward some of the arts and organisation learnt during
		periods of mercenary service under Hittites and Egyptians. Despite the
		doubts of eminent Orientalists, the Shardana, Shakalasha and Tursha who harried
		the confines of Egypt were surely in some sense Sardinians, Sicilians
		and Etruscans. Whether they hailed in the first instance from Sardinia, Sicily
		and Italy or only retreated there after failures on the eastern coasts,
		is far more doubtful.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">[1]</a></sup></font> Certain it is that the islands and peninsula were
		the seats of a curious Late Bronze Age civilisation which, despite a strong Oriental flavour, was based at least
		industrially on Central European rather than on Aegean or Asiatic traditions.
		The peninsula and islands being now incorporated in the continental
		economic system and having taken over from the Aegean the role of mediators in
		the diffusion of Oriental inventions, a few words on the cultures of Sicily,
		Sardinia and Italy in the age of transition from bronze to iron will form
		a necessary prelude to any account of events north of the Alps.</p>
		<p>At the same time one general aspect of life in the latter region and also in
		the East Mediterranean area must be touched upon here; I refer to the
		spread of cremation cemeteries termed urnfields &#8212; a phenomenon already attributed
		to the Middle Bronze Age in Hungary and Upper Italy, but now becoming
		general from the Euphrates to the Irish Channel. The bodies of the dead were
		cremated, their ashes enshrined in cinerary urns and these buried close
		together with other vessels in extensive cemeteries, termed urnfields. The
		grave is seldom marked by a barrow; on the other hand cinerary urns were
		often deposited as secondary interments in earlier barrows. In several parts of
		Central Europe it was the practice to bore a hole through the walls or
		base of the cinerary urn. German archaeologists term such an aperture the
		ghost-hole (Seelenloch), believing that it was designed to allow the soul of
		the departed to escape from the jar that contained his mortal remains.</p>
		<p>It should be remembered that cremation was not a new rite, first introduced
		during the Late Bronze Age. Even in Early Helladic graves on Levkas we find
		burnt human bones enclosed in large jars. And there are instances of Neolithic
		cremations from Central Europe, Brittany and England. Isolated instances
		occur widely during the Early Bronze Age, and the practice was by no means rare in the
		Tumulus culture of the Middle Bronze Age. To the same period we have assigned
		a number of barrows covering inurned ashes from the British Isles. Even
		urnfields may, in Hungary and North Italy, go back to the Middle Bronze Age,
		but they become general first in the Late Bronze Age or the contemporary Early
		Iron Age of Greece and Syria.</p>
		<p>Conversely it must be insisted that inhumation was not universally abandoned in
		the latter period. It remained the regular rite in the Illyrian
		regions, Southern Italy, Sicily and Macedonia till well on in the Iron Age
		and was still freely practised also west of the Rhine and in parts of
		Greece. Nowhere, indeed, would burial rite alone constitute a reliable
		criterion of age. Moreover, in view of the wide distribution of the rite in
		earlier times, the racial movements inferred simply from the appearance of
		cremation in Greece and Syria at the beginning of the Early Iron Age
		(equivalent there to our Late Bronze Age) are very insecurely based.</p>
		<p>We begin our account of Late Bronze Age cultures with Italy and the adjacent
		isles, even though iron was rapidly replacing bronze there; for in the
		Early Iron Age deposits we find bronze tools of the types still exclusively
		used north of the Alps, and in the latter regions types of the more
		southern Iron Age appear in a purely Bronze Age context. Greece on the other
		hand may still be excluded as having no direct influence on the bronze
		industry north of the Alps after its very early passage into the Iron Age.</p>
		<h4>SICILY</h4>
		<p class="fst">During the earlier phases of the Bronze Age, as in the previous Copper Age, the
		culture of Sicily<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">[2]</a></sup></font> had maintained an essentially East Mediterranean character. During the first half
		of Orsi's Siculan II period, which corresponds to our Middle Bronze Age,
		the native culture had been dominated by Minoan industry and art. Palaces were
		built with stone foundations as in Greece, and shrines furnished with
		ritual objects of a Minoan character. The dead were buried in rock-hewn family
		vaults reminiscent of the usual Mycenaean chamber tombs, though carrying
		on a tradition rooted in the island since the Copper Age (Orsi's Siculan I).
		The Siculan II bronzes are inspired directly by Minoan models, though
		mostly of local manufacture. So we find long rapiers referable to Type II a
		from the Shaft Graves of Mycenae (chapter III) and daggers equally of Minoan
		ancestry. The common razors (Fig. 83), though a specifically Siculan
		variant, have likewise Cretan prototypes. Fibulae of violin-bow form were
		worn as east of the Adriatic. And direct imports from Greece were plentiful:
		the early tombs are furnished with a comparative abundance of Mycenaean
		(LM III) vases and Late Minoan beads were worn.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the later half of the Siculan II period, represented by cemeteries like
		Cassibile and Finnochito, farther inland than those described above, the
		industrial orientation of the island had changed. The dead were indeed still
		often buried in chamber tombs, a habit which persisted into the full Iron
		Age or Siculan III. The pottery, too, preserved native traditions enlarged by
		the inclusion of orientalizing forms such as askoi. The safety-pins
		evolved farther along the separate lines sketched in chapter III. But the remaining
		bronzes tend to conform more and more to standard types current at the
		same period in Upper Italy and the Late Bronze Age north of the Alps.</p>
		<p>Shaft-hole axes indeed persist in a local form even into Sicilian III, but
		beside them we find in hoards winged celts, socketed celts and lug-adzes.
		The spearheads have proper cast sockets and sometimes eyelets in the base of
		the blade. The commonest razors now conform exactly to the rectangular
		&#8220;Villanovan&#8221; type with the handle riveted on (Fig. 88) despite some
		interesting transitional forms with maple leaf blades and flat tangs. This
		is the period of the serpentine and elbow fibulae (Fig. 113) supplemented by simple arcs.</p>
		<p>A very similar culture reigned at the same time in Southern Italy, a region
		that had always been closely allied to Sicily since Neolithic times. One
		notable type, assignable strictly to the local Iron Age, was a short sword
		provided with a flange carried right round the flat tang to hold the plates
		of the hilt and the pommel. The type is directly derived from a familiar LM III short sword.</p>
		<p>In both regions large founders&#8217; hoards<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">[3]</a></sup></font> attest at once an economic
		reorganisation and social disturbance. Both Oriental and northern elements have
		been obtruded upon the native culture in a manner not yet plain. At the same
		time the resultant cultures exerted an influence on the West as the
		Siculan fibulae from the hoard at Huelva show.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">[4]</a></sup></font> How the Siculan and South
		Italian spearheads with eyelets in the base of the blade are related to
		the similar and contemporary British type is less clear.</p>
		<h4>SARDINIA</h4>
		<p class="fst">Far more insular and consequently puzzling is the vigorous civilisation that
		grew up in the great island farther north. Sardinia is rich in copper and silver.</p>
		<p>Even during the Copper Age<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">[5]</a></sup></font> it had been an important centre of population
		and industry. Elaborate rock-cut tombs, sometimes carved with bulls&#8217;
		protomae and including marble statuettes among their grave goods, disclose
		Aegean inspiration. On the other hand, numerous bell-beakers and West
		European daggers are clearly occidental features. A similar blending of Eastern
		and Western traits characterises the Late Bronze Age of the island.
		</p>
		<p>
		Chambered tombs continued to be used as burial places even then, but have for
		the most part been plundered. The period is better known from dwellings
		&#8212; peculiar round towers termed nuraghi. The Sardinian Bronze Age is therefore
		often alluded to as the nuragic period.
		</p>
		<p>
		A nuraghe<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">[6]</a></sup></font> is an approximately conical tower, built without mortar, of
		rough, almost megalithic blocks. The only external opening was a low,
		tunnel-like doorway that eventually gave access to a large beehive-chamber.
		A winding stair in the thickness of the wall led to one or more upper
		storeys of similar plan. The nuraghi were evidently the castles of martial
		chieftains. At their feet clustered the round beehive huts of their peasant
		henchmen. Such strongholds are strung out at relatively short intervals along
		the valleys or fertile plains, evidently implying a peculiar clan
		organisation in which the need for defence outweighed all other considerations.</p>
		<p>In addition to the fortresses a number of partly coeval structures of a sacral
		character have recently been explored by Prof. Taramelli.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">[7]</a></sup></font> These
		generally include subterranean sanctuaries from which numerous votive bronzes
		may be recovered. That at Santa Anastasia consisted of an outer temple
		with a facade of dressed stone, from which a flight of steps led down to a circular pit covered with a
		corbelled roof.</p>
		<p>The castles had been long occupied and repeatedly plundered, leaving few relics
		of their original occupants, A better idea of the bronze industry of
		the nuragic age may be obtained from numerous hoards<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">[8]</a></sup></font> that testify in some
		cases to the piety of the islanders, in others to the disturbed
		conditions of the times. These depots belong for the most part to a time when
		iron was already in general use on the Italian mainland, but still
		contain archaic types, directly descended from quite ancient models and
		accordingly produced by a school of craftsmen whose divergent specialisation
		must have begun in pure Bronze Age times. Their archaic traditions are rooted
		mainly in continental workshops. Few industrial types or weapons are East
		Mediterranean or Asiatic, though eastern influences are conspicuous in the
		votive bronzes. So, among the axes, curiously splayed flanged celts,
		two-eared palstaves and two-looped socketed celts were the commonest types
		current. (The founders&#8217; hoards contain also old Copper Age flat celts
		collected for recasting.) On the other hand, double-axes and axe-adzes might be
		Aegean types, though the tubular projection that surrounds the
		shaft-hole is more reminiscent of Hungary. Again the typical weapons are
		curious bronze-hilted daggers, rather like Early Bronze Age forms, or very
		archaic triangular or ogival types, swords with pronounced midrib and spur for
		the hilt or flanged tang. Socketed spearheads, socketed sickles and
		rectangular razors, resembling the Villanovan blades but that the handle was
		cast in one piece with the blade, are also conspicuous. The rather rough
		pottery includes notably askoi and jugs with thrown-back necks and cut-away
		lips, both old Aegean and Anatolian shapes.</p>
		<p>In the nuragic sanctuaries and hoards we find an extraordinary variety of
		votive statuettes and models in bronze. Figures of warriors, crude and
		barbaric in execution but full of life, are particularly common. The warrior
		was armed with a dagger and bow-and-arrows or a sword, covered with a
		two-horned helmet and protected by a circular buckler. The dress and armament
		leave no doubt as to the substantial identity of the Sardinian
		infantryman with the raiders and mercenaries depicted on Egyptian monuments as
		&#8220;Shardana&#8221;. At the same time numerous votive barques, also of bronze,
		demonstrate the importance of the sea in Sardinian life.</p>
		<p>This extraordinary culture accordingly shows indications of relations with
		the West &#8212; two-eared palstaves, socketed sickles &#8212; with Hungary and even
		perhaps with the Caucasus (statuettes and other models very like the Sardinian
		have turned up there) in addition to Central Europe and Upper Italy.
		Amber beads from the nuraghi may even mean connections with the far North. Were
		the Sardinian smiths originative innovators whose new models were
		carried westward and imitated there, or merely slaves who copied at the
		dictation of their pirate masters the odd types the latter picked up in distant
		raids? And how are the nuraghi related to the Scottish brochs, similar in
		several architectural details and evidently symptomatic of an analogous clan
		organisation? Above all, were the Sardinians of the Late &#8212; nay belated &#8212; Bronze
		Age descendants of the Copper Age population who had seen service under
		Egyptians and Hittites, or did new arrivals from Asia Minor or the Caucasus
		dominate these? Such questions inevitably rise only to be dismissed as
		unsolved.</p>
		<h4>THE VILLANOVA CULTURE IN ITALY</h4>
		<p class="fst">While Sicily, South Italy and Sardinia were new and by no means secure
		acquisitions of the continental economic province, it had included Upper Italy
		since the beginning of the Bronze Age. There, as noted in the last chapter, the
		dominant cultural group during the Middle Bronze Age was that of the
		terremaricoli, who even penetrated to the extreme South as well. A later phase
		in the same people's culture is illustrated by the urnfields of
		Bismantova and Fontanella south of the Po, of Pianello in the Marche (East
		Central Italy) and Timmari in Apulia.
		</p>
		<p>
		These cemeteries are marked as later than the typical terremare by the types of
		razor, safety-pin and bracelet. The razor has a quadrangular blade with
		separate handle riveted on (Fig. 88). In addition to violin-bow fibulae, generally with beads on, and sometimes with figure 8 twists in (after
		the style of Fig. 112), the bow, simple arched bows and others with two
		loops were current. Ingot torques with twisted wire bodies and wire
		finger-rings with spiral ends were also worn. The distinctive pot form is
		already a storeyed or biconical urn. Such consist of a base in the form of an
		inverted conical bowl with inturned rim surmounted by a conical neck with
		everted lip. The parts are separated by a pronounced shoulder rather than a
		keel. The ornament, restricted to the upper cone, is limited to incised triangles, chevrons, U-shaped or horizontal S figures and dimples or warts encircled by
		grooves (Fig. 181). A hoard, of the same date (Randall-Maclver considers
		it later), indicates that cups of beaten bronze, decorated with embossed
		knobs, were already in use. These cemeteries may be dated between 1200BC and 1050BC.</p>
		<p>A little later a belt of Italy from the Adige to the Tiber is found to be
		thickly settled by an industrious folk, termed Villanovans after the suburb
		of Bologna where their culture was first identified. Pigorini and his disciples
		hold that they were just the descendants of the terremaricoli; they
		would then be the Umbri and Latini of Roman tradition. Randall-Maclver prefers
		to invoke a second invasion from an unknown &#8220;Hungary&#8221; to explain the
		Villanovans. Assuming the first interpretation to be the more correct, as it
		is the more economical, we may call the northern Villanovans Umbrians,
		the southern ones, differentiated from the former by minor peculiarities,
		Latins. We must note, too, that the Villanovan culture is divided between
		three chronological phases, termed respectively Benacci I, Benacci II and
		Arnoaldi after the peasants on whose farms typical cemeteries were dug up.
		Iron was in use throughout these three periods and the two last are excluded
		altogether from the purview of this book.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Villanovans, like their ancestors of the terremare, were primarily peasant
		farmers, living in mean huts grouped in villages of very modest size.
		The round huts themselves with walls of wattle and daub are represented for us
		by the models used as ossuaries among the &#8220;Latins&#8221; (Fig. 185); the
		famous temple of Vesta preserves a glorified version of the same primitive hut.
		</p>
		<p>
		But these farming communities included skilled metalworkers and traders. Round
		Bologna vast depots of scrap-metal, the so-called &#8220;foundries&#8221;, have
		been discovered. Old tools, weapons and ornaments were gathered here for
		resmelting from every corner of Europe as the types included in the hoards
		show; even British socketed sickles are represented. In return for such scrap, for ores, gold, amber and salt, Villanovan bronzes were exported as
		far as Denmark and Transylvania. At the same time relations, direct
		or indirect, were maintained with the Eastern Mediterranean; glass beads from
		Villanovan graves leave no doubt on this score. Villanovan bronze work
		agrees too closely with Phoenician and Assyrian for the resemblance to be
		accidental. And from that quarter came eventually knowledge of the new metal,
		iron. In Benacci I times, however, that material is represented only by a few
		small objects that might have been imports.</p>
		<p><img src="fig181-185.JPG" width="417" height="734" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Late Bronze Age urns" align="right">The graves were simply holes in the ground, sometimes lined with stone slabs,
		in which the cinerary urn was deposited. The ossuary itself was
		sometimes enclosed within a large jar termed a dolion, especially in Etruria
		and Latium. In this region, too, a receptacle hollowed out of a block of
		stone occasionally replaced the dolion. The dolion is generally a rough
		two-storeyed jar. The Villanovan ossuary is equally two storeyed. It resembles
		a bowl with inverted rim and a horizontal handle, surmounted by a conical neck
		with splayed rim. It is, that is, a biconical urn closely related to
		those from Bismantova or Pianello, though with a broader shoulder (Fig. 182). Often it was actually made of two pieces of hammered bronze united
		by rivets. More commonly the vessel is of black carboniferous pottery
		ornamented with elaborate maeanders, triangles, lozenges and rosettes.
		Sometimes small bronze studs were set in the clay to enhance the effect. As
		noted, the Latins used hut models as ossuaries. The urn was covered in the
		Umbrian area by a dish, in the Latin often by a helmet. While cremation was the
		general rite, isolated inhumation graves are known from all districts.
		</p>
		<p>
		The commonest tools are celts with terminal wings and very wide blades, knives with a spur-like tang, quadrangular double-edged
		razors (Fig. 88) or semilunar single-edged specimens (a later
		type), tweezers and fish-hooks. The best known weapon is the socketed
		spearhead, but antennae swords (Fig. 57) were imported and presumably
		used. The head was protected with ovoid bronze casques, surmounted by broad,
		decorated crests. Horses were controlled by bronze bits, the cheek-pieces
		in some instances taking the form of stylised steeds. Among the ornaments may
		be mentioned broad girdles of hammered bronze, pins surmounted by small
		knobs or terminating in a shepherd's crook, simple arc fibulae and early
		developments thereof, massive bracelets with overlapping ends, and ribbon
		cylinders. Besides ossuaries, cups and buckets (situlae) were made of hammered
		bronze.</p>
		<p>Villanovan art is unmistakable. The vases, girdles and helmets of bronze are
		decorated with rows of bosses, beads or concentric rings, all embossed,
		and sometimes supplemented by engraved lines that reproduce the patterns
		known already from the pottery. A very distinctive and popular motive is
		moreover a pair of birds&#8217; heads projecting from a circle or wheel (Fig. 27, no.
		3). The design is presumably a solar symbol connected with the sun disk
		of the Egyptians probably through a Hittite or Phoenician variant.</p>
		<h4>THE LAUSITZ CULTURE</h4>
		<p class="fst"><img src="fig186.jpg" width="478" height="390" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Lausitz grave group, after Antiquity" align="right">The knowledge of ironworking naturally traversed the Alps from Italy with a
		material retardation, so that even throughout Benacci I times a pure Late
		Bronze Age was ruling in Central Europe. Here two or three great urn field
		groups succeed the Early Bronze Age cultures in the fertile valleys and
		along the riverine trade routes, while the Tumulus culture persists in the uplands and heaths,
		modified by these neighbours.
		</p>
		<p>
		The most conspicuous of the urnfield cultures is known by the name of Lausitz,
		a part of Saxony and Western Silesia where it is richly represented. It
		originated there or farther east out of Aunjetitz antecedents, possibly mixed
		with other undefined ingredients. From this cradle it spread to occupy
		the whole area from the Saale to the Vistula and from the Spree to the Austrian
		Danube and the Slovakian mountains.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Lausitz folk were primarily peasant farmers, but were at pains to control
		trade routes and supplies of ore. In their communities dwelt competent
		smiths whose moulds, anvils and founders&#8217; hoards have come down to us. The
		people dwelt probably in log-cabins built of trunks laid horizontally and
		supported by posts, quite like the dwellings of American pioneers. The houses
		were normally long one-roomed halls with the entry on the small side.</p>
		<p>The dead were cremated, and their ashes, enclosed in cinerary urns, deposited
		in extensive cemeteries, sometimes under a barrow. The characteristic
		Lausitz ossuary is constituted by two truncated cones placed base to base. It
		was normally covered by a dish and accompanied by a high-handled mug,
		an amphora and a rough pot. In later graves, vases with side spouts, termed
		feeding-bowls, vessels in the shape of animals, and clay rattles occur.
		Apart from the rough pots, Lausitz vases are generally smooth and often
		burnished. At first they were buff in colour; later dark-faced wares became
		more popular, and graphite was even used to intensify the effect. The ossuary
		is normally plain, save for scratches radiating from the base. Other
		vessels were decorated at first with large conical warts projecting out of a
		round depression. Later warts gave place to flutings or corrugations, oblique or
		forming semicircles (Fig. 186). The Lausitz people used celts with terminal
		wings and an ear, or a socketed form, knives with a spur for the attachment of
		the handle or with a metal handle terminating in a ring, button sickles
		and eventually horseshoe razors and tweezers. But celts and perforated axes of
		stone, arrowheads of flint or bone and many implements of horn and
		bone were still used. The favourite weapons were spears with lanceolate
		socketed heads, and arrows, tipped with flint, bone or socketed bronze points,
		supplemented by comparatively rare swords with flanged tangs. The horse had
		certainly been domesticated. He was controlled by bits ending in horn cheek-pieces.</p>
		<p>Common ornaments in Lausitz graves are pins with a vertically pierced eyelet in
		a spur projecting from the shaft, massive armlets with overlapping
		tapering ends, cylinders, ingot torques with twisted body, finger-rings of
		several coils of wire terminating in spirals, spectacle-spiral pendants and
		flat buttons with a loop on the back. Safety-pins were rarely worn; all were of
		the two-member family with a flattened oval bow. Beads of glass or
		amber are only occasionally found in graves. Gold, on the other hand, chiefly
		in the form of wire, is not uncommon in Bohemian settlements. The
		precious metal must have been carried in this form as a medium of exchange, but
		curious ornaments were made by plaiting gold wire together. Finally in
		the later phase of the Lausitz culture a few bronze cups of Italian style found
		their way to Bohemia.</p>
		<p>This culture was cradled, as we have indicated, in a southerly corner of the
		North European plain. Thence it spread over the mountains into Bohemia and
		across Moravia into Lower Austria and Slovakia. On the borders of its homeland it grew
		into the so-called Silesian culture, which likewise spread southward and
		was flourishing in Eastern Bohemia and Moravia when iron was introduced into
		those regions along the amber trade route from Italy to East Prussia.</p>
		<p>In Central Bohemia the Lausitz invaders met the people of the Tumulus culture
		advancing from the West as well as remnants of the old Aunjetitz population. Under these conditions there arose here in the latest Bronze Age (Kraft
		E) a specialised group, termed the Knoviz culture, which deserves a
		brief mention. Besides its urnfield cemeteries we know here deep pits, some
		perhaps dwellings, others rubbish pits or silos. In the latter we find,
		together with broken animal bones and other kitchen refuse, human bones, hacked
		about with knives and split to extract the marrow. Evidently
		cannibalism was not unknown to this people in Central Europe. Civil servants,
		engaged in suppressing the practice in Africa or New Guinea, may like to
		remember that it was current in Europe 3000 years ago, and that among a
		comparatively advanced group. For the cannibals made splendid pots. Their
		cinerary urns are based upon a degenerate Lausitz ossuary that has lost its
		angularity, surmounted by a swelling neck, so as to give the impression of
		two vases one on the top of the other. Broad-brimmed bowls with twisted
		pillar-like handles rising from the shoulder also deserve mention.</p>
		<h4>THE ALPINE URNFIELDS</h4>
		<p class="fst"><img src="fig187-190.jpg" width="309" height="656" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Bronze vessels" align="right">The Knoviz culture already shows the influence of the South-west Bohemian
		Tumulus culture which in its turn had been profoundly modified by contact
		with a second group of urnfields. The latter had developed on the Upper Danube and its tributaries in Austria, Bavaria and the Tyrol, whence
		it spread down the Rhine and across Switzerland. This Alpine culture is
		a far less coherent group than the Lausitz; probably it had several roots
		constituting originally distinct groups, and no doubt it absorbed in its
		expansion diverse elements. It may have originated among some descendants of
		Early Bronze Age folk dwelling in the valleys (at Gemeinlebarn in Lower
		Austria and Straubing in Bavaria both periods are represented in the same
		cemetery), influenced (whatever that may mean) by Hungarian groups, the
		Lausitz culture and its neighbours, the tumulus-builders. Lausitz &#8220;influence&#8221;
		is certainly patent in the use of typical Lausitz ossuaries in Lower
		Austria and even far away in the Tyrol. Some indeed would contend that it was
		constitutive: the whole group would owe its rise and specific character
		to an actual infusion of Lausitz folk, perhaps as an organising force bringing
		together other communities. That certainly is a simple explanation,
		perhaps too simple.
		</p>
		<p>
		Yet in its general character the North Alpine culture was very similar to the
		Lausitz, though richer and more warlike. Its authors dwelt in log-cabins
		or pit-dwellings. They walled off projecting spurs of the mountains (promontory forts) or defended hilltops, the walls in each case being of stone
		and turf, strengthened with a palisade.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">[9]</a></sup></font> As elsewhere, these fortifications
		would be places of refuge rather than permanent villages; the latter
		were probably situated in the valleys. The miners of the Tyrolese copper lodes
		and the rock-salt of Hallstatt, whose methods have been sketched in an
		earlier chapter, belonged to our North Alpine group. And the rich cemetery of
		Hallstatt, that gives its name to the First Iron Age in Central Europe,
		is an urnfield of the type described below, though of later date. The long timbered galleries, the shafts
		and ladders and other workings which the visitor to Hallstatt may still
		admire are apparently pure Bronze Age.
		</p>
		<p>
		Cremation was of course the normal burial rite, and an urn was deposited in
		every grave. Sometimes, however, the ashes were laid outside it. The urn
		itself, often very large, was globular or piriform, but always provided with a
		cylindrical neck surmounted by a projecting brim (Fig. 183). It
		might serve as a dolion containing the ossuary proper, generally a smaller
		version of the same type. In the Tyrol the ossuaries&#8217; rims are supported by
		twisted pillar-like handles (hence the name &#8220;pillar urns&#8221;). The walls may be
		decorated with warts and &#8220;false cord impressions&#8221; obtained by rolling a
		twisted ring over the soft clay. With such cylinder-neck urns, true Lausitz
		ossuaries are sometimes encountered as noted above. The accessory vases
		jugs, dishes, and cups are usually fine, often polished with graphite and
		decorated with incised patterns, flutings or conical warts.
		</p>
		<p>
		Typical implements are celts (axes and adzes) with terminal wings and an ear
		(Fig. 17), socketed chisels and gouges, a wide variety of
		single-bladed knives, grooved sickles, fish-hooks, and razors with an openwork
		metal handle, at first with an irregular oval blade slit at the end,
		later horseshoe shaped (Fig. 87). The distinctive weapons are slashing
		swords with richly engraved bronze hilts or with flanged tangs, giving
		place later (Kraft E) to Hungarian, Morigen and antennae types. In addition to
		swords the warrior used spears with socketed heads, and bronze-tipped
		arrows.</p>
		<p>A wealth of ornaments is found in these graves in contrast to the poor Lausitz
		interments. The commonest pins have large poppy, vase (Fig. 109), turban or bulb heads.
		Safety-pins of violin-bow type are found sporadically in the Tyrol, and others
		with a wiry bow twisted in figure 8s and terminating in a horizontal spiral
		catch-plate, in Bavaria, massive bracelets decorated with ribs 
<img src="fig116-120.jpg" width="276" height="268" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Oranments" align="right"> (Fig. 116) encircled the arms. The girdle was fastened with disk-shaped clasps. On
		it or on a necklace were hung pendants in the form of a wheel as well as
		glass, amber, and gold beads and spectacle-spirals of bronze wire. Gold disks
		ornamented with rings of stamped circles have been found in some graves
		and were doubtless solar symbols.</p>
		<p>Finally, vessels of beaten bronze occur even in the earlier phase (Reinecke and
		Kraft D). The commonest are cups decorated with embossed circles as in
		Italy. But a contemporary barrow at Milavec in Bohemia contained a remarkable
		bronze bowl, shaped like the usual cinerary urn but mounted on a little
		wheeled car.</p>
		<p>In art a revival of spiral decoration is to be observed on sword hilts of phase
		D. But even then concentric circles and arcs were commoner, and in
		phase E these alone survive.</p>
		<p>In addition to the solar symbolism of the pendants, curious cult objects now
		meet us in the settlements. These are made of clay in the form of a pair
		of horns and very likely served as firedogs, the hearth being of course a place
		of sanctity. Nonetheless these objects are derived in the last resort
		from the &#8220;Horns of Consecration&#8221; that had played a prominent part in Minoan
		cult from Early Minoan times till the collapse of the Mycenaean culture.</p>
		<p><img src="fig192.jpg" width="276" height="268" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Bronze shield, Bohemia" align="right">The urnfields just described were in their earlier phases concentrated in the
		valleys of the Upper Danube, the Inn and the Isar. In the highlands on every side the tumulus-builders lived
		on still. But they now practised cremation regularly, though seldom,
		save in Bohemia, enclosing the ashes in cinerary urns. Their pottery was
		profoundly influenced by that of the urnfields, and most of the bronze types
		just described might also be found under barrows. The old bronze-studded wooden
		targe was now at times replaced by a buckler of hammered bronze. Unlike
		the British products, the Bohemian and South German shields are definitely
		convex all over and lack any distinct umbo. They were strengthened with
		concentric ridges hammered up from the inner side and were manipulated by a
		pair of small handles and one big central handle (Fig. 30).
		</p>
		<p>
		The North Alpine urnfield culture is of such importance in British
		archaeology that its development during the last phase of the Bronze Age (Kraft
		E,
		Reinecke Hallstatt A) and into the Early Iron Age deserves a rather more
		detailed examination. Two zones must be distinguished. The inner zone,
		extending northward to the Main with its core in Switzerland and Bavaria, was
		nourished by the industry of the lake-dwellings and the trade of the
		western amber route.</p>
		<p>The Bronze Age lake-villages of Switzerland and Upper Bavaria seem to result
		from the synoecism of older pile-hamlets<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#10" name="10b">[10]</a></sup></font> effected under the
		leadership of the urnfield folk with the collaboration of the authors of the
		Rhone culture and perhaps of immigrants from Upper Italy.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#11" name="11b">[11]</a></sup></font> The new
		pile-villages, situated farther from the present shore than their neolithic
		forerunners, were regular industrial settlements. Individual villages would
		even specialise in the manufacture of a particular kind of article, for
		instance, armlets. Their manufactures were exported to Hungary, Silesia and the
		North Sea.</p>
		<p>In return, Danish bronzes and amber, Hungarian swords, Villanovan
		horse-trappings and metal vessels flowed in. Stimulated by the blended
		traditions of
		their compatriots and by contact with foreign centres of industry, the clever
		smiths devised original types of tool, weapon and ornament.</p>
		<p>Noteworthy among these are knives like Fig. 77, antennae and Morigen
		swords (Fig. 56), horseshoe razors (Fig. 87), pins with
		hollow globular heads decorated with inlaid eyes, and great hollow bracelets
		either closed and kidney-shaped (Nieren-ringe) or with open splayed-out
		ends. More generalised types of course occur. While socketed chisels and gouges
		were quite the rule, winged celts with the wings near the butt and a
		loop (Fig. 17) were far commoner than socketed celts. Bronze bits (Fig.
		98) were manufactured to control the horses, though those with
		horn cheek-pieces remained in use.</p>
		<p>The fine black or grey pottery includes most urnfield forms and, in addition,
		globular vessels with a narrow out-turned rim, and tulip-shaped beakers
		with an almost pointed base. Fluted decoration, fretwork, as in the Tumulus
		culture, and very neat engraved patterns, often curvilinear, adorned the
		vases. A rare technique was to inlay the depression of the fretwork with tin.
		The latest vases show the polychrome decoration of Hallstatt types
		stripes blackened with graphite on a ferruginous red wash.</p>
		<p>The art of the lake-dwellings<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#12" name="12b">[12]</a></sup></font> is characterised above all by the minute
		exactness with which the linear patterns were executed. The patterns
		themselves include circles and semicircles but no spirals. Some pots, how	ever, exhibit a sort of maeander in which the angles have been rounded off.
		In this connection we may note, too, rattles of animal form and the horn-shaped fire-dogs already described.</p>
		<p>The civilisation of the lake-dwellings in Bavaria, Switzerland and Savoy, begun
		already in Reinecke's phase D of the Bronze Age, reached its zenith in
		the succeeding phase but lasted into the Early Iron Age (Reinecke's Hallstatt
		B). In that period invaders sacked the villages, while a recurrence of
		moister climatic conditions led to their final desertion. But by that time
		urnfield folk, whose funerary pottery shows them to be directly descended
		from the lake-dwellers, were settling in Northern Spain.
		</p>
		<p>
		The urnfield people from the Danube basin occupied the valleys of the Rhine,
		the Neckar and the Main, bringing in their train Swiss and Bavarian
		elements and absorbing others from the native Tumulus groups. Thus we find
		inhumations as well as cremations. Throughout this area the essential
		features of the urnfield culture in its later phase were well maintained, and
		Swiss bronzes circulated freely. But directly we cross the Main or the
		Saone we enter impoverished provincial regions where archaic urnfield types
		persisted in a context that transcends the limits of the pure Bronze Age.
		The urnfield folk spread, that is, both into Holland and Central France, but
		lost touch with the creative centre and became economically isolated.
		</p>
		<p>
		We have already described the gradual spread of the Tumulus culture across
		Central France. Particularly in Aube we have many burials of this class
		assignable to phase D.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#13" name="13b">[13]</a></sup></font> But the tumulus builders were followed by urnfield
		folk. A cemetery of this type, discovered at Pouges-les-Eaux, Nivre.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#14" name="14b">[14]</a></sup></font> is the best available evidence of this, though many sherds labelled &#8220;age du
		bronze&#8221; in French museums indicate a wider distribution for the culture. At Pouges, as on the Rhine, inhumations occurred
		side by side with cremations. The bronzes included two razors, one with
		openwork handle of the type current on the Upper Danube in phase D, the other
		flat-tanged like some Sicilian and all British blades (Fig. 90).
		The pots, on the contrary, look rather like degenerate versions of the types
		current in Switzerland during phase E (Hallstatt A), to which also most of
		the pins could be assigned. It looks almost as if a band of urnfield folk had
		clung tenaciously to some types current in their homeland at the time of
		their departure while adopting contemporary models in other directions. At the
		same time the hoards<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#15" name="15b">[15]</a></sup></font> suggest that South-eastern France was winning
		a certain independence of Central European traditions and was susceptible to
		currents coming, not from the Danube or Upper Italy, but from Sardinia
		and Sicily.
		</p>
		<p>
		The phenomena observed on the Lower Rhine in Belgium and Holland in other
		respects reproduce those noticed in France. The urnfield folk spread thither
		slowly and mixed with tumulus-builders. Urnfield types of vases, all very
		degenerate, persisted well into the Hallstatt period. Scarcely any bronzes
		are found in graves, and hoards are inordinately rare. Still razors of archaic
		form occur as in France.</p>
		<h4>THE LATE BRONZE AGE IN THE NORTH</h4>
		<p class="fst">The Teutonic craftsmen in Denmark, Sweden and North Germany maintained the high
		standard of skill achieved during the Middle Bronze Age. The austere
		beauty of the earlier art was, however, sacrificed in the more florid products
		of the later. In general, Teutonic culture in the Late Bronze Age is
		only a richer autonomous development of that described in the last chapter. Foreign influences were
		certainly absorbed, but without causing any interruption in the
		tradition. The most radical was seen in burial rites. Cremation rapidly
		replaced inhumation. But even this change was by no means catastrophic.
		During the first half of the Late Bronze Age a barrow was still regularly
		erected over the remains. The ashes were frequently deposited in hollowed tree-trunks, big enough for a complete skeleton, as in the preceding period.
		Urn-burial on the contrary was at first exceptional. The rare ossuaries,
		however, are generally related to the biconical Lausitz type, showing the very
		strong influence from that culture that reached the Baltic. Another, but
		certainly native, innovation of the period was to construct round the grave the
		outline of a ship in stone, a practice that clearly anticipates the
		burial rites of Viking times.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#16" name="16b">[16]</a></sup></font>.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Late Bronze Age of Scandinavia falls quite easily into three phases,
		corresponding to Montelius&#8217; Periods III, IV and V. The regular interchange of
		products with the south makes it clear that these are parallel to Reinecke's
		Bronze D and Hallstatt A and B-C respectively. The last phase of the
		Teutonic Bronze Age is therefore contemporary with the full Iron Age in
		Southern Germany and the Danube basin. North-eastern Germany was becoming
		increasingly important during the later phases, but during Montelius&#8217; V
		Teutonic culture was also spreading westward to the Upper Rhine and the Dutch
		coasts. Eventually, however, the brilliant native development was arrested with
		the political and industrial expansion of the Kelts late in the Iron
		Age.
		</p>
		<p>
		A few characteristic Teutonic products may now be briefly mentioned. Socketed
		celts were regularly used throughout the age. At first they exhibited a
		ridge in relief down the middle of either face reminiscent of the projecting ends of the
		split knee-shaft between the flanges of the Middle Bronze Age celt, but
		by Period IV this motive had become purely conventional. At the same time
		winged celts, like those of the North Alpine area, were imported. The
		single-edged knives were scarcely altered at first, but in Period V, when Swiss
		and other southern types were imported, the native knife- handles
		sprouted out into opposed scrolls like the pommels of antennae swords. The
		horse&#8217;s head handles of the razors were becoming increasingly
		conventionalised in Period III and gave way to swans&#8217; heads or pairs of spirals
		in Period IV. To that period, too, belong blades engraved with
		representations of the &#8220;solar barque&#8221; (Fig. 91).</p>
		<p>The sword remained the warrior's principal weapon. In Period III the hilt might
		still consist of alternate bronze and amber disks, with a flat rhombic
		pommel; in IV the plated tang predominates; while in V antennae, Morigen, and
		true Hallstatt swords were imported or even copied locally.
		</p>
		<p>
		The contemporary ornaments all grew out of older native types, showing that no
		material change affected Teutonic dress. The most important pins were of
		course the two-piece fibulae in III with large flat spiral coils as
		catch-plates that were replaced in V by large shield-shaped plates (Fig. 115). In the latter period there was a revival of simple pins, those with
		spiral, sunflower (like Fig. 106) or saucer-shaped heads being most
		popular. Another queer pin, to which Early Iron Age deposits at Aegina and
		elsewhere in Greece offer parallels, has a dumb-bell head formed by joining
		two disks by a bar at right angles to the shaft. The handsome bronze collars
		were still worn by ladies during Montelius&#8217; III. In IV and V they were ousted by hooked torques, some genuinely
		twisted, others with the torsion imitated by cast ridges or engraved lines.
		In V the direction of the torsion often alternates, one strip being twisted to
		the right, the next to the left and so on (Fig. 137). Some torques
		are even hinged. Tutuli assumed gigantic proportions. In Period III the central
		spike had already grown into a veritable pillar surmounted by a knob;
		by IV the disk may be 7 inches across and the pillar rise 4&#189; inches from the
		rim; while in V the ornament looks like a pedestalled goblet 6 inches or
		more across, richly decorated on its surface and equipped with ingenious
		devices for attachment on the inside (Fig. 136).
		</p>
		<p>
		Late Bronze Age pottery in the Teutonic province is extremely dull. The only
		attempt at decoration was to smear over the surface with the fingers or a
		stiff brush. As already remarked, a biconical ossuary was in use from Periods
		III to V. In the latter period ossuaries in the form of round huts, much
		as in Latium, were also being made, particularly in Eastern Germany.
		</p>
		<p>
		The dullness of the pottery is counterbalanced and explained by a wealth of
		bronze and gold vessels. Many of the bronze cups, buckets and urns were
		obviously imported from Italy, exhibiting the distinctive forms and decorative
		devices of the Villanovan bronze industry. But another group of vessels
		is no less of clearly native manufacture. Among these are the so-called hanging
		basins of bronze (they may really be grotesquely enlarged tutuli) of
		Periods IV-V. They have rounded or conical bases, a narrow almost horizontal
		shoulder and a short vertical neck from which grow two low handles (Fig. 134). The base and neck are richly engraved. No less remarkable is the
		great group of gold vessels, perhaps mainly ritual, assigned to Period IV. They are ornamented with zones of
		repouss concentric circles separated by ribbed ridges . In the case of
		round-bottomed vessels the circles may form a star radiating from the base, or
		such a star may be left reserved, the space between the points being
		filled with bosses or circles. The commonest form is a round-bottomed cup
		without handles. Two remarkable gold vases in the form of a very high-crowned
		hat, though found respectively in the Rhenish Palatinate and in Central France,
		seem in style to belong to the Teutonic group.
		</p>
		<p>
		The gold of these vessels is so thin that many believe them to have been used
		in ritual only, A number come from bogs where they might have been cast
		as offerings to some chthonic divinity. And we certainly possess ritual objects
		of the Late Bronze Age that must have been disposed of in that way, a
		usage indicated much later in the Norse sagas. The most famous and unambiguous is a bronze horse on wheels<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#17" name="17b">[17]</a></sup></font> connected with a gold-plated<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#18" name="18b">[18]</a></sup></font> disk
		also on wheels. The disk is 6 inches in diameter. The whole object stands for
		the solar chariot; after use in some pagan ceremony it had been ritually
		slain (broken) and cast into the moss of Trundholm in Zealand. The same order
		of ideas doubtless sanctified some little gold boats found in another
		Danish bog. The wheeled bowls of Sweden and Mecklenburg, like that from
		Milavec in Bohemia, may equally rank as ritual vessels. The boat symbol,
		combined often with swans' heads, recurs again engraved on razor-blades.</p>
		<p><img src="fig193.jpg" width="123" height="400" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Late Bronze Age trumpet from Scotland" align="right">The art of the Late Bronze Age is on the whole inferior to that of the
		preceding epoch. The spiral survives on collars of Period III and grows into a
		variety of scroll patterns in V (Figs. 135-136). But the purely geometric
		principle was being already abandoned, the scrolls blossoming out into stylised
		animals' heads. To the same period belong undoubtedly some of the rock-
		carvings and ornamented tombs. Even the Kivik grave is assigned by some
		authorities to the Late rather than the Middle Bronze Age.</p>
		<p>In this connection we may refer to the so-called lurer, musical instruments
		indirectly related to the trumpets depicted on the Kivik monument. Some
		thirty of these instruments have been found, generally in Scandinavia and North
		Germany, all belonging it seems to Periods III-V. They consist of
		composite bronze tubes with a total length of as much as 5 feet, but wound in a
		curious S form. The sectional tubes of which they are composed have
		been cleverly united either by casting on or sweating on or by elaborate
		interlocking joints. The lurer each had a range of eight notes and are
		generally found in pairs, each tuned to a different pitch (Fig. 193).</p>
		<h4>HUNGARY AND RUSSIA</h4>
		<p class="fst">The Late Bronze Age on the Middle Danube is particularly complicated owing to
		extensive tribal movements. West of the river in Styria, Carinthia and
		Slovenia, iron came into use very early among Bronze Age groups of
		indeterminate antecedents, some showing relations with the Hungarian and North
		Alpine urnfield folks, others with tumulus builders. In the mountains of
		Bosnia groups of barrows, covering inhumation interments accompanied by
		bracelets, pins and tutuli characteristic of the (northern) Tumulus culture
		together with a few fibulae of Adriatic form, constitute the nuclei of the
		well-known Iron Age cemeteries of Glasinac.</p>
		<p>East of the Danube, on the other hand, a belated Bronze Age continued till iron
		was introduced by bands of Scyths pushing westward across South Russia
		towards 500BC, and by Kelts advancing in the opposite direction rather later.</p>
		<p>
		The Late Bronze Age throughout the region was ushered in by an invasion of
		people related to the Lausitz and Knoviz groups who settled especially round
		the copper-bearing regions of Northern Hungary and Slovakia.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#19" name="19b">[19]</a></sup></font> Their
		distinctive pottery, fluted like the later Lausitz vases, enables us to trace
		them farther south and indeed right across the Balkans into Macedonia; there
		they put an end to the Late Mycenaean colonies as indicated in Chapter I.
		Everywhere they introduced the socketed celt, swords with plated hilts, and
		spearheads with lanceolate blades. In North Hungary the socketed celt
		almost completely displaced the practical shaft-hole axe that had previously
		been manufactured in the regions. In Transylvania, however, elaborate
		derivatives of the old types were still made.
		</p>
		<p>
		In Northern Hungary the fusion of the invaders with older inhabitants produced
		a very flourishing culture. It is illustrated by extensive urnfields,
		remains of regular industrial villages and rich traders&#8217; hoards and &#8220;foundries&#8221;. Among distinctive local types are slashing swords with rich spiral
		ornamentation engraved on the bronze hilts, and a variety of elaborate fibulae
		with big spiral catch-plates. An exceptional number of bronze buckets
		and cauldrons (Figs. 188-189) and cups of gold or bronze have been
		discovered in this area, principally on its fringe on the plains of the Upper
		Tisza. That was evidently a dangerous tract on a great trade route leading from
		the head of the Adriatic diagonally across Hungary to the Upper Tisza
		and so to the gold, copper and salt deposits of Transylvania. The metal vessels are all of forms
		current in Italy and decorated with repouss bosses in Villanovan style;
		the buckets even show the bird's head and circle motive in its classical North
		Italian form. Yet the exceptional number of the metal vessels and the
		use of presumably native gold in the manufacture of many suggest that some at
		least must be local products. Their distribution elsewhere, too, is not
		very different from that of the undoubtedly Hungarian swords just described.
		</p>
		<p>
		Between the ninth and seventh centuries, too, South Russia at last entered the
		orbit of the European economic and industrial system for a short time.
		Particularly in the Ukraine<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#20" name="20b">[20]</a></sup></font> a local bronze industry arose, inspired
		mainly by Hungarian and Central European models. But here the western types
		subsist side by side with developments of native &#8220;Copper Age&#8221; forms. Thus
		socketed celts are found together with peculiar flat celts. Out of this
		mixture some interesting varieties were evolved. We may mention a socketed celt
		with two ears, a type which spread across Eastern Russia to the
		headwaters of the Jenessei in Siberia,<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#21" name="21b">[21]</a></sup></font> and socketed spearheads
		with big semicircular slits in the blades that must be related to
		contemporary British types. In the Ukraine they must be pre-Scythian (seventh
		to fifth centuries or earlier); farther north they belong to the local
		Iron Age. Yet side by side with these we have tanged spearheads of Asiatic
		ancestry and others with folded socket as in Crete. To the same period
		belong the sickles with a hooked tang.</p>
		<h4>
		GREAT BRITAIN</h4>
		<p class="fst">We have already seen that urnfield cultures, more or less, connected with the
		North Alpine group were spreading in a westerly direction across Central France from Switzerland or the
		Upper Rhine and down the Rhine into Belgium and Holland. The latter
		current was further reinforced by one originating in northern Central Germany.
		Ultimately these movements impinged upon the coasts of Britain and
		represent the so-called invasion with which our Late Bronze Age may be said to
		open.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#22" name="22b">[22]</a></sup></font> Actually this &#8220;invasion&#8221; was a complex process effected by
		the infiltration of discrete bands of invaders<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#23" name="23b">[23]</a></sup></font> in this probably resembling
		the earlier phases of the &#8220;Anglo-Saxon Conquest&#8221;. No doubt the
		invaders started from various centres and landed at diverse points along our
		coasts. Some certainly followed the precedent of the Beaker folk and
		crossed the North Sea from the Low Countries. Others may have come across
		France to the Channel ports, and a group that appears in Cornwall and Devon
		had Armorican affinities. The cumulative result was that &#8220;Lowland England&#8221;
		was dominated by the invaders, while in the highland country to the north
		and west the intrusive culture was absorbed in strict conformity with the
		principle recently enunciated by Fox.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#24" name="24b">[24]</a></sup></font> In the south therefore exotic
		ceramic types were extensively manufactured, while the Late Bronze Age pottery
		is directly descended from Middle Bronze Age wares. Nevertheless the
		changes in economic arrangements and burial rites, presumably introduced by the
		invaders, affected every part of the island, and their new tools and
		weapons were distributed evenly throughout the land. Conversely, even in
		Southern England the native tradition in pottery and bronze work was never
		entirely interrupted.
		</p>
		<p>
		Hence in general the invasions produced no radical or abrupt change in economy
		and industry. Probably the communities, in the lowlands especially, were larger, more agricultural and
		more settled than before. In Southern England a number of roughly
		rectangular earthworks defended by ditch and bank<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#25" name="25b">[25]</a></sup></font> can safely be assigned to
		this period and give evidence of more or less permanent settlement. In
		this area the people lived in pit-dwellings excavated in the chalk. Air
		photographs, supplemented by excavation, have also demonstrated that some of
		the old cultivations known as &#8220;Keltic fields&#8221; likewise date from the Late
		Bronze Age.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#26" name="26b">[26]</a></sup></font> Broad rectangular fields, varying in size from 100 square
		feet to 400 by 150 square feet, were cultivated with the aid of a foot-plough
		(such as was recently used in the Hebrides) or a primitive plough drawn by
		two oxen that did not undercut the sods, on the slopes of the open downs and
		uplands. Between each field narrow strips were left uncultivated.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#27" name="27b">[27]</a></sup></font>
		Owing to the slope of the land, soil was washed down from the upper edge of the
		field and gradually accumulated in a little straight bank against the
		uncultivated strip at its bottom. The low ridge thus formed is known as a
		(positive) lynchet, and it is a study of the relation of such lynchets to
		earthworks of the Late Bronze Age that enables us to date the cultivations. The
		formation of a lynchet clearly implies a considerable period of
		cultivation, confirming the impression of sedentary life produced by the
		settlements. In upland Britain, moreover, a number of very substantial round
		huts of stone, on Dartmoor and in Anglesey for instance, certainly go back at
		least to the Late Bronze Age, carrying on an early native architectural
		tradition. Even villages with elaborate stone defences, like Grimspound on
		Dartmoor, may be Late Bronze Age.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#28" name="28b">[28]</a></sup></font> Both these solid huts and the fine
		stone defences are incompatible with a semi-nomadic life, though not implying necessarily that extreme fixity attained by our peasantry since the Saxon
		conquest.</p>
		<p>More permanent occupation is likewise indicated by the adoption of burial in
		urnfields in place of, or besides, in small groups of barrows. Urnfields
		comparable to those of the Lausitz folk or the Italici are in fact distinctive
		of the Late Bronze Age not only in Southern England but even in the
		lowlands of Scotland as far north as Aberdeen. Very often, however, an old
		barrow was used for secondary interments in the Late Bronze Age, a practice
		also noticed in Holland and Scandinavia.</p>
		<p>A change in the economic organisation of Great Britain is denoted by the founders&#8217; hoards that appear for the first time in this period.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#29" name="29b">[29]</a></sup></font> They
		imply a new class of travelling smiths, agents or pupils of the great founders
		of Bologna. Exotic types whose previous history is to be sought in
		Central Europe, such as winged and socketed celts, leaf-shaped swords with
		plated hilts, and bugle-shaped objects from harness,<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#30" name="30b">[30]</a></sup></font> are specially
		common in these hoards and again illustrate foreign traditions as well as
		actual imports. Trade relations with the lands beyond the Channel and the
		North Sea had naturally been cemented by the movements of peoples from those
		quarters. But the old traffic along the sea routes to Spain and the
		Western Mediter- ranean was revived at the same time, and Britain thus
		participated in the intensified maritime trade of the Mediterranean basin
		suggested at the beginning of the chapter, A spearhead of British type (almost
		identical with Fig. 70) was included in a hoard" redged up
		from the harbour of Huelva in Southern Spain,<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#31" name="31b">[31]</a></sup></font> and socketed sickles occur
		even in Sardinia. At the same time, as in the later Stone Age, the
		maritime trade route was continued round the west coasts of Scotland presumably to Scandinavia. It is marked by a series of late hoards on
		Islay, Skye, the Hebrides and Orkney,<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#32" name="32b">[32]</a></sup></font> By this route,
		presumably, Scandinavian types, such as the sunflower pin, reached Ireland and
		England.</p>
		<p>The British bronze industry of this period is represented only by hoards and
		isolated objects. Except for razors and a few ornaments, no metal
		objects are found in the graves. For axeheads the later palstaves with no
		indication of flanges below the stop-ridge remained in use side by side with
		socketed celts and rare winged celts with high-placed wings and an ear.
		Numerous woodworkers&#8217; tools testify to the revival of carpentry, of whose
		products unhappily no remains survive. To this class belong the socketed
		gouges, tanged chisels and curved knives (Fig. 71). Socketed chisels
		and socketed hammers probably belong rather to the equipment of the
		metalworker. Original products of the native industry are the socketed sickles
		and
		socketed double-edged knives (Fig. 70). This is also the great age of the
		bifid razors (Fig. 90). Such are found even in graves and settlements.</p>
		<p>The slashing sword now became the warrior's principal weapon. Most have
		flanged tangs originally plated with horn or wood, straight shoulders and a
		blunted strip (ricassd) ending in a nick at the base of each edge. A few are of
		true Hallstatt pattern, widened out for the pommel like Fig. 58.
		Bronze-hiked swords are rare. Apart from an antennae sword found at Lincoln<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#33" name="33b">[33]</a></sup></font> these bear little resemblance to Central European models, but find
		rather distant parallels in Sweden. The wooden sheaths that held these swords
		normally terminated in long narrow chapes (Fig. 60). Some, however, were fitted with true winged chapes of Hallstatt form (Fig, 61). The spear, too, retained its importance. The commonest type
		has a leaf-shaped head, but blades with lunate openings on either side of
		the midrib (Fig. 70) are native British products derived from older local models to the north.</p>
		<img src="fig191.jpg" width="298" height="410" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Bronze shield, Scotland, Late Bronze Age" align="right"><p>The warrior was now defended, as in Central Europe, with a round buckler of
		bronze. The commonest native type exhibits a hollow central boss or umbo
		encircled by concentric ridges alternating with rings of small bosses. A flat
		strip of metal, doubled over at the edges, was riveted across the umbo to form a handle (Fig. 191).</p>
		<p>
		Though no wheeled vehicles have come down to us, such were certainly in use.
		Indeed one domestic hoard, found in the cave of Heathery Burn (Durham),<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#34" name="34b">[34]</a></sup></font>
		included six bronze cylinders with an internal diameter of 4 inches which
		are supposed to be nave collars. The horses which drew the vehicle were
		controlled by bits terminating in antler cheek-pieces just like Central
		European specimens. A remarkable gold peytrel (collar or brunt) found at Mold
		(Flintshire),<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#35" name="35b">[35]</a></sup></font> if really Bronze Age at all &#8212; and its decoration is of Bronze
		Age style &#8212; shows how richly steeds might be caparisoned. The so-called
		bugle-shaped objects tubes with a solid loop on one side and a slit on the
		other (Fig. 96) are probably pieces of harness.</p>
		<p>No safety-pins were included among the toilet articles of a Late Bronze Age
		Briton. Even pins were still rare, except for the sunflower type (Fig. 106). On the other hand, bronze buttons with a loop at the back now
		supplement the buttons of jet or amber as dress-fasteners. From Ireland come a
		number of small penannular objects of gold terminating in great cup-like disks.
		Some authorities think that they too were dress-fasteners<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#36" name="36b">[36]</a></sup></font>. A
		thread would have replaced the movable pin of the contemporary Teutonic fibulae to which the Irish ornaments in other respects
		bear a very striking resemblance (Fig. 139). Other gold objects
		of similar forms but with a larger hoop might be worn as bracelets (Fig. 117). Sir John Evans<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#37" name="37b">[37]</a></sup></font> pointed out the extraordinary resemblance these
		bear to the so-called manillas &#8212; the ring money still current in West Africa in
		his day. It may then be that these Irish gold objects were really
		currency. The use of identically shaped &#8220;money&#8221; in West Africa would be a
		survival from prehistoric times commemorating our Bronze Age trade along
		the Atlantic coasts.</p>
		<p>Gold torques also continued in use, as did probably the segmented, quoit-shaped
		and star-shaped beads of faience, and others of amber and jet. In late
		Scottish hoards<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#38" name="38b">[38]</a></sup></font> we find beads of blue glass with yellow or white
		inlays such as would be more at home in the Second Iron Age or La
		Tene period.</p>
		<p>Buckets and cauldrons of hammered bronze are included in several hoards, and,
		judging by the Heathery Burn cave,<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#39" name="39b">[39]</a></sup></font> were in regular use for domestic
		purposes by well-to-do families. The buckets are of Italian pattern and may
		well be imported thence. Their models in any case are not older than
		Benacci II times. The bottom on some British specimens has been strengthened
		externally by the attachment of a cruciform framework. The cauldrons, on
		the other hand, are purely British though late in date and probably inspired in
		the last resort by Italian models. The majority come from Scotland and
		Ireland, and some are actually associated with iron weapons. They are globular
		in shape and consist of several bronze plates riveted together and
		hammered over a hoop that gave stability to the mouth. The elaborate
		attachments for the loose ring handles have been cast on (Fig. 190). The great hoard of bronzes from Dowris in County
		Meath and that from Duddingston Loch, Edinburgh, were probably contained in such cauldrons.</p>
		<p>The Dowris hoard contained also trumpets of types found elsewhere in Great
		Britain and Ireland. All are much shorter than the Teutonic lurer and lack
		their distinctive twists. The Dowris types were cast in one piece; some have
		the mouthpiece at the end, others at the side. A third variety, formed of
		sheetmetal bent over and riveted to form a tube, may date from the Iron Age.
		In the Irish trumpets, as in the Teutonic lurer, the derivation from an
		original animal's-horn instrument is patent (Fig. 193).</p>
		<p>The best known pottery of the Late Bronze Age is sepulchral and consists of
		cinerary urns. These naturally fall into two main classes &#8212; those derived
		from old native forms and those inspired by exotic traditions.</p>
		<p>The degeneration of the overhanging-rim urn produced, as we saw in chapter
		IV, the cordoned or hooped type (Fig. 147). In it one ridge of
		pinched-up clay represents the lower edge of the rim and another below it the
		old line of the shoulder. This type is commonest north of the Thames, in
		Wales and in Ireland. Dr Clay<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#40" name="40b">[40]</a></sup></font> believes that in the south of England a
		similar process led to the formation of what Abercromby calls the Deverel
		group 2. The urn of this group is cylindrical or bucket-shaped and has a single
		moulding encircling the body a couple of inches below the lip (Fig. 148). This moulding can be treated as a survival of the original overhanging
		rim. It is, however, generally decorated with finger-tip impressions, a
		technique which at once relates it to certain foreign types of urn with which
		the Deverel group 2 is often associated. A third native type of urn is that termed by Abercromby
		&#8220;Encrusted&#8221;. It develops out of the enlarged food vessel in Northern England and
		Southern Scotland and spreads thence to Wales and Ireland.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#41" name="41b">[41]</a></sup></font> These urns
		were decorated by applying round pellets or strips of clay to the surface
		while the vessel was drying and arranging them to form simple patterns
		chevrons, squares, concentric arcs or interlaced mouldings. The applied clay was
		carefully joined up to the body by rubbing with a wet finger, but none the less
		the strips easily fall off. The strips and even the spaces between them
		are often incised with a bone point, but never exhibit finger-tip impressions
		(Fig. 149).</p>
		<p>Over against these native types, which except for the bucket urns all belong to
		highland Britain, stands the foreign pottery of invaders as represented
		in Southern England including Cornwall. The most striking are the globular urns
		constituting Abercromby's Deverel group I. The body is globular with
		four little handles on the line of greatest swell. There is no clearly marked
		neck, but where it should be comes the decoration, consisting generally
		of horizontal flutings, simple horizontal incisions, or bands of wavy lines
		made with a sort of comb (Fig. 152). Abercromby rightly noted the
		similarity of the fluted decoration to that on the urnfield pottery of Central
		Europe and France.</p>
		<p>Abercromby's Type 3, groups 2 and 3, consist of tall bucket-shaped or
		cyclindrical urns decorated with horizontal, vertical or zig-zag mouldings.
		The mouldings are normally embellished with finger-tip impressions and, in
		group 2, often form loops suggestive of handles (Fig. 150). The rim is
		generally slightly everted in a manner reminiscent of metal vessels. Plastic
		finger-tip mouldings had been used decoratively along the northern shores of the Mediterranean and in Central Europe from Neolithic
		times. From Italy to Holland they are quite common in the urnfield period.
		This feature therefore helps to attach the group in question to continental
		cultures without giving us any clue as to the exact home of its makers.
		</p>
		<p>
		The third intrusive ceramic type is commonest in Cornwall. It is a slightly
		biconical urn, the upper cone being much shorter than the lower. Two or
		four strap handles sit on the keel. The upper part and shoulder is decorated
		with vertical or horizontal zig-zags, sometimes formed by the impression
		of a cord (Fig. 151). The patterns are thus very similar to those of the
		Middle Bronze Age overhanging rim urns. But the forms of our group are
		undoubtedly strongly reminiscent of the Armorican urns of an earlier date
		described in chapter V.</p>
		<p>One peculiar feature is common to all the three classes of intrusive pottery.
		On the base of the urn there is often a cross or star in relief on the
		inside. It has been suggested that these relief patterns were really structural
		and served to strengthen the base. They would actually be useful if the
		pot was used for boiling water by dropping in hot stones, and several of the
		decorated pots came from settlements. Another possibility is that the
		ridges imitate the stays used to strengthen metal buckets, but these were
		generally affixed to the outside. Dr Clay regards the crosses and stars as
		religious symbols. Indeed in some Hungarian urnfields a swastika has been
		observed in relief inside urns.
		</p>
		<p>
		A word must be said in conclusion as to the duration of the Late Bronze Age in
		the British Isles. Quite obviously it everywhere overlaps the Central
		European Hallstatt period very considerably; the Hallstatt types from our
		hoards suffice to prove that. Moreover, until recently no connected settlements or cemeteries other than those of the Late
		Bronze Age were known that could be assigned to the First Iron Age. It was
		only in the Second or La Tene period that new groups could be
		identified. In the last few years it has been proved that people with a very
		late
		Hallstatt culture, including distinctive pottery, did settle on our shores
		notably at Park Brow<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#42" name="42b">[42]</a></sup></font> near Cissbury in Sussex, at All Cannings Cross<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#43" name="43b">[43]</a></sup></font> near Devizes in Wiltshire and at Scarborough. But though these newcomers
		did use pottery of Hallstatt character, their safety-pins were already
		of La Tene type, ie, though they brought a culture of Hallstatt
		ancestry, they and it only arrived in La Tene times so that their
		coming need not be anterior to 450BC. Moreover, the intrusive wares at All
		Cannings and elsewhere are associated with Bronze Age urn types<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#44" name="44b">[44]</a></sup></font> so
		that even in Southern England the survival of our Bronze Age culture throughout
		the whole of the Hallstatt period of Central Europe seems
		indisputable. In more inaccessible regions it lasted longer still. That is
		implied in the late associations of the Irish and Scottish cauldrons. The
		glass beads from the hoard of bronzes on Lewis and from a cordoned urn at
		Edderton, Rossshire, both point to a survival well into the Second Iron
		Age. And in one urn of Bronze Age fabric from Cornwall Roman coins of the
		fourth century AD have been recorded! On the whole, then, the Bronze Age
		in Southern England must have lasted till about 400BC and elsewhere till at
		least 200BC, probably to the beginning of our era in Scotland.</p>
		<p>The beginning of the Late Bronze Age is less easily determined. The intrusive
		types with which it opens need none of them be later than Reinecke's
		Hallstatt A. But if they reached here not by trade but as the results of ethnic movement, they might have been already out of date on the Danube
		before they reached the Thames, just as our Hallstatt pottery would have
		been already superseded by La Tene wares on the Rhine before it was used at All
		Cannings. On the contrary, the Sicilian safety-pins associated with the
		British spearhead at Huelva imply that such Late Bronze Age types were current
		here before 900BC. So perhaps a date of about 1000 for the first
		invasions would not be much too high.</p>
