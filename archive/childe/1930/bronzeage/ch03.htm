		<h3>III. TYPOLOGY</h3>
		<p class="fst">The variety of tools, weapons, vessels and ornaments at the disposal of Bronze Age man was immensely  greater than that known to his Stone Age forebears. It is the material expression of enrichment of life and extended control over nature. The enormous wealth of  objects that have come down to us from this brief  episode in human history renders possible a vivid  picture of that phase of life. Still it is almost embarrassing to the archaeologist. Here we shall describe only  the principal types of general interest, confining ourselves in the case of the Ancient East to varieties that  have a special chronological or comparative value for  students in North-western Europe.</p>

		<h4>CELTS (AXE-HEADS)</h4>
		 
		<p class="fst">The most widespread, and for typological chronology  the most important, family of tools is conveniently  termed celt. This designation is properly applied to axeheads, but is sometimes extended to adzes and even chisels of comparable form. The celt, whether used as  an axe or an adze, was mounted on a wooden staff or  shaft, the blade in the former case running parallel to the length of the shaft, in the latter at right angles thereto. The butt might of course be fitted directly into  a slit in a straight shaft, but, in the case of all the  European celts whose evolution is sketched below, it  is certain that the so-called knee-shaft was employed<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">[1]</a></sup></font>.  This can most readily be obtained by cutting off a  suitable bough or sapling just below the point where a branch grew out of it. This side branch was then broken off a couple of inches from its root and split. The celt  was inserted in the cleft which was then bound
		round  with sinews or wire (Fig. 9).</p>
		<p><img src="fig9.jpg" width="454" height="312" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Knee-shaft of wood for hafting celts" align="right"></p>
		<p>Axeheads and adze-heads of ground stone or flint  had been in use throughout
		the Neolithic Age and  indeed formed the most distinctive external trait of 
		that epoch. The earlier metal celts very closely resemble  the stone
		implements, some even reproducing the local  peculiarities of the Neolithic
		celts from the same district.  Nevertheless, some authors consider that
		polished stone  celts are all really imitations of copper originals.</p> 
		<p>The simplest form of metal celt, therefore termed  the flat celt, is in any
		case, like the stone implements,  practically flat on both faces, and the sides
		are nearly  but seldom quite parallel. Except in Egyptian examples the blade
		is generally slightly splayed out;  this splay would be a natural result of the
		hammering  necessary to sharpen the edge. Flat celts occur already  in
		predynastic Egypt, prediluvian strata at Susa in  Elam and in prehistoric
		cities on the Indus, as in the  earliest metal-using cultures of Cyprus, Crete,
		the  Cyclades and Greece. While most early Oriental specimens are made of
		copper, the form was reproduced in  bronze at Troy and in the Aegean area
		generally.  Simple flat celts are also characteristic of the &#8220;Copper Age&#8221; in
		Southern and Eastern Russia, Hungary, Italy,  Sardinia, Spain and Ireland. They
		occur sporadically  over a much wider area, even reaching Scandinavia, and  are
		sometimes associated with stone celts (eg.in the  Rhine valley) in hoards and
		quite often in settlements.</p>
		<p><img src="fig10-13.JPG" width="311" height="470" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Flat celts, Egypt, Susa, Scotland; Winged flanged celt, Scotland" align="right">By the beginning of the local Bronze Age the outlines  of the flat celt were
		being modified in Europe. In the  British Isles we meet with types whose butts
		are very narrow in proportion to the wide curving blade (Fig. 12). In Bohemia
		there is a variant with pointed  triangular butt, probably an adze-head.</p> 
		<p>But by this time the typological evolution was already  beginning. The first
		stage in the series is the flanged  celt (<i>Randleistenbeil, hache a rebords
		elevees</i>) distinguished by ridges at the sides of either face. These  flanges
		were doubtless in the first instance produced by  the hammering on the sides
		that was in any case  necessary after casting in an open mould<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#1A" name="1Ab">[1A]</a></sup></font>. But they 
		were useful in two ways, both giving the tool increased  longitudinal rigidity
		(diminishing the risk of buckling  in the sense of the blow) and preventing the
		head  waggling on its shaft by gripping the prongs of the  split branch.</p>
		<p>That the value of such flanges was known at least to the ancient Egyptians is shown by a chisel strengthened  in this way from the tomb of Hetepheres, the mother  of the Pyramid-builder Cheops (Khufu),<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">[2]</a></sup></font> but it was  apparently never applied to celts in Egypt, Mesopotamia, the
		Aegean area or even Hungary and Southern  Russia. On the other hand, flanged
		celts, even of copper,  occur in Italian tombs, and in bronze they are characteristic of the Early Bronze Age in Italy, Czechoslovakia,  Southern Germany,
		Britain and South-eastern Spain.  By a mature phase of that period local
		variations are  observable. Italian specimens always have a nick in the butt
		formed by leaving intact part of the two jets from  the casting in a valve
		mould (Fig 20); in  Bohemian and Central German types the butt is triangular. In the Middle Bronze Age the foregoing  types persisted with divergent
		local variations in certain  areas. In Scandinavia, for example, the body is
		rather  long, the sides exactly parallel, and the flanges very prominent (Fig 24).</p>
		<p>In Western Switzerland and the Rhone valley a type, based on Italian models,
		grew up distinguished by a great spatuliform blade. At the same time
		evolutionary improvements were being tried along three distinct lines.</p>
		
		<h4>Winged celts (Lappenbeil, hached ailerons)</h4>
		<p class="fst"><img src="fig14-19.jpg" width="328" height="793" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Palstaves, Germany, England; Celts, England, Switzerland" align="right">To diminish further the risk of side-slip a section of the flanges on either
		face was widened to produce wings that could be hammered round the
		shaft-prongs on either face. Thus arose the winged celt that was at home in
		south-west Germany and Upper Italy. At first the wings are in the centre of
		the implement (Fig. 21) ; towards the close of the Middle Bronze Age they
		have retreated towards the butt. Then in the Late Bronze Age a loop or
		ear is added for the thongs that lashed the tool on to its shaft, and the
		section of the body below the wings is thickened, perhaps under the influence
		of the palstaves (Fig. 17).</p>
		<h4>Palstaves (Absatzbeil, hache a talon)</h4>
		<p class="fst">To prevent the axehead slipping back up the cleft of the shaft at each stroke
		and so splitting the knee-stick, a stop-ridge was developed between the
		flanges to engage the ends of the shaft-prongs. The rudiments of such a
		stop-ridge are observable on some Early Bronze Age flanged celts both in Great
		Britain and in Central Europe, but the fully developed palstave belongs to the
		Middle Bronze Age (Reinecke C) and is characteristic of Scandinavia,
		North-west Germany, France and Britain (Fig. 14). Subsequently the space
		between the flanges below the stop-ridge was filled up with metal in the
		casting, A reminiscence of the flanges is for a time preserved in the form of decorative ridges. Especially in
		Scandinavia one can see very pretty examples of &#8220;reminiscent decoration&#8221;. A
		tapering ridge is cast on each face of the palstave below the stop-ridge to
		simulate the prongs of the cleft shaft that had once projected downwards
		visibly on the faces of the tool. A rather later stage is denoted by the
		addition of an ear (Fig. 15). There is a group of palstaves with two
		ears, one on each side, in the Iberian Peninsula, Southern France and Sardinia.
		A few such palstaves have been found in the British Isles (Fig. 16), principally in the south and west. These are doubtless imports, but it is
		generally supposed that the palstave reached the Iberian Peninsula from
		Britain, It is nevertheless to be noted that implements with two lateral loops
		and exactly resembling the palstave in plan but flat on both faces are
		common in Sardinia.</p>
		<h4>Constricted celts (Bohmishes Absatzbeil)</h4>
		<p class="fst">The advantages of the winged celt and the palstave seem to be combined in a
		tool called by German archaeologists a Bohemian palstave. It probably grew
		up as follows. In Switzerland and Bavaria we find a sort of flanged celt that
		has been hammered so hard on the centre of each side that the body is
		narrowed while wings develop on either face (Fig. 22). The classical
		Bohemian palstave might result from imitating the product by casting, the
		section below the wings being again cast solid (Fig. 23). This form
		appears in Bohemia and Moravia during the Middle Bronze Age and was exported
		to neighbouring territories, particularly Hungary<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">[3]</a></sup></font>.</p>
		<h4>Socketed celt (Tullenbeil hache a douille)</h4>
		<p class="fst">The natural culmination of all the previous developments was the socketed
		celt. It no longer requires the splitting of the shaft-end, eliminates
		side-slip almost entirely and provides a surface to engage the end of the
		shaft. In the Late Bronze Age this form certainly ousted all its
		predecessors. According to Montelius it was evolved from one of them, the
		winged celt. It is supposed that the wings grew till they met round the
		shaft prongs, forming a sort of tube divided by a septum (the body of the celt)
		in the middle. This was then eliminated and the end of the tube closed.
		It is true that some socketed celts, principally in Italy and Southern Germany
		where winged celts were current, exhibit semicircular ornaments cast in
		relief on either side (Fig. 26). These certainly imitate wings and, on
		the theory, are survivals thereof. However, in Hungary and Moravia the
		socketed celts, instead of the wing pattern, are decorated with ridges forming
		a V on either face that, just as obviously, reproduce the opening of a
		constricted celt. And in Scandinavia there are remarkable socketed celts with
		imitation flanges and a tapering ridge between them on the lower part
		of the blade (Fig. 25). These successfully reproduce the effect of a
		flanged celt, hafted, and bound round with a bronze collar. Sophus
		Muller<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">[4]</a></sup></font> indeed contends that the Danish socketed celt was evolved
		thus out of the flanged celt with attached bronze collar without the
		intervention of the winged celt.</p>
		<p><img src="fig20-26.jpg" width="408" height="590" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Celts, Bohemia, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Switzerland" align="right">None of these a priori theories can be accepted. The imitative patterns invoked
		by Montelius and Sophus Muller were not introduced by the ancient
		smiths in pious memory of effete devices, but to make a new type of tool look as like as possible the accustomed model of each region, a model
		with which it was in active competition. Quite possibly the origin of
		the socketed celt is to be sought outside Europe. There were in Mesopotamia
		cutting tools, adzes rather than axes, made out of a sheet of metal whose
		sides were folded round so as to form a tubular socket. Similar implements are
		known from South Russia, and in the Evans Collection at Oxford is a
		socketed gouge from Dalmatia formed on this principle.</p>
		<p>The centre where European socketed celts were first made has not been exactly
		determined. The oldest actual examples would be some Danish ones assigned
		to the Middle Bronze Age. In general the socketed celt belongs to the Late
		Bronze Age.</p>
		<h4>T-AXE</h4>
		<p class="fst">The Egyptians, owing probably to the kinds of timber available, did not fix
		their axeheads into a split stick but bound them on to a shaft by lashings
		round and across the head. To facilitate attachment, lugs, continuing the line
		of the butt, grow out of it on either side by Middle Kingdom times if
		not before<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">[5]</a></sup></font> (Fig. 28). Stone axeheads of the same form have been
		found in Egypt, Central Asia and America.</p>
		<h4>ADZES</h4>
		<p class="fst">Adzes in general follow the same lines of evolution as the foregoing types of
		axeheads. The adze may be narrower and sometimes there is a difference
		in the slope of one face<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">[6]</a></sup></font>. Take a cross-section along the length of the
		implement and draw an imaginary line from the blade to the middle of the
		butt. Then in an axe the angles made by the two faces with this line must be equal, otherwise each
		blow will go crooked. In an adze no such symmetry about the major axis is
		necessary. The real distinction between an axe and an adze is, however, the
		method of hafting, which can seldom be determined from an inspection of the
		head. Almost any form of celt could be converted into an adze by merely turning
		the blade through a right angle, eg in the case of a knee-shaft by splitting the spur at right angles to the main branch instead of in a line with
		it. Still in Europe the transverse hafting of the celt to make it do
		duty as an adze was falling into desuetude in the later part of the Bronze Age.
		To avoid it the smiths cast palstaves and late winged celts in which
		the blade was at right angles to the concave faces that received the haft's
		prongs (Fig. 18).</p>
		<p><img src="fig26-31.jpg" width="412" height="594" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Celts, adzes, gouge, Silesia, Egypt, Sicily, Scotland" align="right">In addition to these simple variants on the axehead, we should note here one
		or two peculiar types of celt that generally served as adzes. The
		proto-dynastic Egyptian adzes and one or two Elamite examples have rounded
		heads (or butts). Under the Old Kingdom and still more in Middle Kingdom
		times this rounded head was separated from the body by a marked concave neck
		(Fig. 29).</p>
		<p>In the earliest Indian chisels<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">[7]</a></sup></font> the blade expands slightly till about
		one-quarter of its length from the butt, then contracts abruptly after a sharp
		shoulder only to expand again towards the edge. Some adzes of this pattern have
		been found in Late Minoan Crete and elsewhere in the Eastern
		Mediterranean region. A flat celt, developed from this type, in which the neck
		makes a right angle with the shoulders is common in Late Bronze Age
		hoards in Sicily and Southern Italy. From it grows the trunnion celt or
		lug-adze where the shoulders have become definite lugs, projecting on either side, a type
		belonging for the most part to the Hallstatt Iron Age. Its growth, however,
		interlocks with that of the Sardinian flat celts with two lateral loops already
		mentioned in discussing palstaves.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">[8]</a></sup></font></p>
		<h4>CHISELS AND GOUGES</h4>
		<p class="fst">Like the adzes, the chisels follow closely the evolution of the celt; the
		essential feature is the narrowness of the blade. We thus have flat chisels,
		flanged chisels, flanged chisels with a stop-ridge (very narrow palstaves) and
		socketed chisels as well as lugged chisels. Late in the Bronze Age of
		Italy, France and Great Britain tanged chisels appear, probably developed out
		of shouldered chisels such as we found in most ancient India<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">[9]</a></sup></font>. The
		earlier variant, found even with palstaves, closely resembles the
		square-shouldered adze in outline, though the whole tool is naturally more
		slender,
		the tang relatively longer and more tapering, while the blade expands very
		markedly. In the latest Bronze Age the tang is not only narrower but also
		thinner than the portion below the shoulder; in fact it projects from a flat
		surface which would engage the end of a tubular wood or bone handle in
		which the implement must have been held (Fig. 33).
		</p>
		<p>
		Gouges are just chisels with a hollow edge. Implements of this type are known
		in stone from the Balkans and Russia and in flint from Scandinavia.
		Copper chisels with a concave blade are known very early in Mesopotamia, from
		Troy II and from Copper Age graves in South Russia. True socketed gouges,
		resembling socketed chisels with a concave blade, are very common in the Late
		Bronze Age all over Europe. But it will be remembered that gouges with
		the sockets formed by rolling over the metal to form a tube have been found in a Dalmatian hoard. In
		general it should be noted that socketed chisels and gouges spread more
		rapidly and earlier than socketed celts (axes). For example, a lake village at
		Alpenquai near Zurich yielded five socketed chisels and one socketed
		gouge but no socketed celts; their place was taken by twentyseven examples of
		the supposedly older winged type.</p>
		<h4><img src="fig32-33.JPG" width="283" height="277" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Tanged chisels, early and late types, England" align="right">AXES (SHAFT-HOLE AXES)</h4>
		<p class="fst">It is curious that the modern type of axehead that fits on to, not into, the
		shaft had a very limited distribution down to the later Iron Age. The
		expedient of providing a hole in the axehead, parallel to the blade, was
		indeed known in Mesopotamia in prediluvian times<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#10" name="10b">[10]</a></sup></font>. It was also adopted in
		Crete and the Aegean islands, in Hungary and Russia at the beginning of the
		Metal Age in each area and occasionally in Scandinavia, Sicily, Southern
		Italy, Sardinia and Anatolia. On the other hand, this practical type of metal
		axehead was, apart from stray imports, never adopted in Egypt nor yet in
		any part of Central or Western Europe till late in the Iron Age. Even in
		Hungary the shaft-hole axe was practically ousted by the socketed celt in the
		Late Bronze Age.</p>
		<p>The shaft-hole axe is apparently a Sumerian invention. Certainly before 3000
		BC the Sumerians were casting excellent axeheads with a tube for the
		shaft reinforced by rings around it and a ridge at the back opposite and
		parallel to the blade (Fig. 34). Of course the manufacture of such an
		axe required the use of a two-valve mould and a movable core; probably the
		ridge at the back was originally suggested by the seam, though in practice
		enlarged to give additional strength at a weak point. Allied types were soon adopted also in Syria. There and in
		Mesopotamia a curious battle-axe with a very narrow blade was in use during the
		third and second millennia. The South Russian and Hungarian copper axes for
		the most part resemble the Sumerian in having a tubular shaft-hole
		clearly distinguished in profile from the blade (Fig. 36). Viewed from
		above, however, it is seen that the sides of the blade (meeting
		naturally at the edge) form tangents to the shaft-hole. This peculiarity they
		share with the early Aegean axes. But such have no tubular extension
		round the shaft-hole and so look rather like extravagantly thick celts with a
		perforation joining their sides near the end. The Sicilian and some
		Russian types conform to the Aegean pattern. The Hungarian axes of the Middle
		Bronze Age, however, are extraordinarily like mature Mesopotamian
		types.</p>
		<h4><img src="fig34-36.jpg" width="368" height="503" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Axes, Sumeria, Hungary" align="right">TRANSVERSE AXE: SHAFT-HOLE ADZE</h4>
		<p class="fst">Side by side with the weapon described at the beginning of the last
		paragraph, the inhabitants of the Tigris-Euphrates valleys from the earliest
		historical periods to the beginning of the Iron Age used an implement identical
		with the foregoing in respect of its tubular shaft-socket but with the
		blade turned at right angles to the shaft (Fig. 35). This odd type was
		confined to Babylonia and Assyria with the exception of one specimen from
		a grave in the Kuban valley north of the Caucasus and one from Syria.</p>
		<h4>DOUBLE-AXE</h4>
		<p class="fst">The Minoans of Crete preferred an axe with two blades in the same plane and the
		shaft-hole midway between them. This weapon, which was possibly derived in the last resort from Mesopotamia, became a cult symbol in the Minoan
		religion and was in practical use throughout the Aegean world from Early Minoan
		times. There are isolated examples from Hungary, South Russia and Sardinia, the
		latter with a tubular extension of the shaft-hole. In France,
		Switzerland and Germany a few double-axes of copper are known whose central
		perforation is too small to take a real shaft. They must then be symbolic
		and perhaps served as ingots or units of weight. In the same connection
		we may mention an odd implement manufactured in Saxo-Thuringia during
		the Early Bronze Age. It resembles a double-axe in having two rather blunt
		blades in the same plane and a shaft-hole between them, but its edges are
		absurdly narrow.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#11" name="11b">[11]</a></sup></font></p>
		<h4>AXE-ADZE</h4>
		<p class="fst">In the Aegean<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#12" name="12b">[12]</a></sup></font> we find from Early Minoan times a tool resembling a
		double-axe in which one blade has been twisted round till it lies transversely
		to the shaft and the other blade (Fig. 38). A similar type is known from
		Persia and there is an example from the Kuban which, owing to the
		character of the shaft-tube, looks exactly like a combination of the two
		Sumerian axe-types on a single shaft. Axe-adzes are distinctive of the Copper
		Age of Hungary.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#13" name="13b">[13]</a></sup></font> Here, it is said, the shaft-hole has not been made by
		casting but by punching through the red-hot metal. Later the implement
		reached Sardinia, perhaps from Hungary since the Sardinian examples all have a
		short tubular projection round the shaft-hole, a feature noticeable on
		many Hungarian specimens (Fig. 39) but strange to the Aegean series.
		Contemporary with the axe-adzes in Hungary was a sort of axe-hammer that
		might have been made by breaking off the transverse blade of an axe-adze near the shaft-hole.</p>
		<h4><img src="fig38-39.jpg" width="280" height="297" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Adze axes, Crete and Hungary" align="right">BATTLE-AXES</h4>
		<p class="fst">This designation is conventionally restricted to a group of axes with spikes or
		knobs for the butts that are virtually confined to Hungary and
		Scandinavia. In Hungary there are two main types: in one the blade expands
		slightly towards the edge while the butt terminates in a disc. During the
		Middle Bronze Age this disc is flat or slightly convex; in the Late Bronze Age
		a large spike projects from it. The other type, confined to the Middle
		Bronze Age, has a very narrow blade, a long tube for the shaft and a fan-shaped
		butt. Both types may be richly decorated with engraved scroll patterns.
		The comparatively rare Danish battleaxes are considerably more massive and
		generally have a knobbed butt. The majority belong to the Middle Bronze
		Age and are ornamented with engraved spirals.</p>
		<h4>DAGGERS</h4>
		<p class="fst">Almost more important for typological chronology than the celts are the
		daggers, rapiers and swords. The first-named weapons, many of which also served
		as knives, were current from the beginning of the Metal Age throughout the Old
		World. The important features in the dagger are the shape of the blade
		in plan, the provision made against crumpling up under the weight of a thrust
		(securing longitudinal rigidity) and the attachment of the hilt. The most
		primitive form of dagger has a roughly triangular blade that is nearly flat on
		both faces. Triangular daggers are as a rule extremely short, very
		rarely attaining a length of six inches. Any increase in the length must be
		accompanied by an inconvenient widening of the base if the weapon was not to buckle under the
		weight of the thrust, unless the increased length were counterbalanced by a
		thickening of the blade. And, as the dagger was a stabbing weapon, the weight
		of the blade had to be kept down to preserve the proper balance. A
		considerable increase of length was, however, possible if the edges were kept
		parallel for some distance below the hilt before tapering off to a point.
		This produced the so-called ogival dagger (Fig. 46) Both types could be
		cast in an open mould.</p>
		<p>An extension of the blade without undue increase in width, thickness or weight
		was, however, permitted by casting a thick stout ridge running down the
		centre of course in a two-piece mould. This central ridge is termed a midirib
		and greatly diminished the danger of buckling without affecting the
		penetrating power (Fig. 43-44).</p>
		<img src="fig40-42-45.jpg" width="471" height="470" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Predynastic flat dagger with handle; Round-heeled dagger, England, Early Bronze Age; Bronze-hilted dagger, Bohemia, Early Bronze Age" align="right"><p>All daggers were provided with hilts of wood, horn, ivory or metal. Except in
		certain Copper Age types the hilts were affixed to the blades by rivets.
		The hilt, consisting either of a single piece, slitted longitudinally to slip
		over the blade, or of two pieces, united by nails or lashings, might be
		attached directly to the butt of the blade or on to a tongue-like projection of
		the latter, termed a tang. This gives a distinction between tanged and
		tangless daggers. The tang may be either wiry, in fact a sort of prolongation
		backwards of the mid-rib, or flat, but is always narrower than the butt
		from which it projects like a neck with shoulders on either side. The butt or
		heel may be either a straight line along the widest part of the blade
		forming the base of the triangle, or a triangular, trapeze-shaped or
		semicircular projection of the blade behind that line. When neither rivets nor tang were employed to secure the hilt, the backward projection of the blade had
		to be relatively long to prevent waggling. In a curious Copper Age
		dagger from Western Europe (Fig. 41) it is so long as to resemble a tang,
		but, since its edges form continuous lines from the base of the blade
		proper, this type should be assigned to the tangless class. In Egyptian
		tangless daggers, most Aegean types, and all continental European models the
		broad base of the hilt enveloped the butt on either side leaving a semicircular
		space in the middle (Figs. 40, 42, 45). This feature is traceable
		even on the hilts of flint blades in predynastic Egypt. It is conspicuous on
		bronze-hilted blades in Europe (Fig. 45) and is recognisable on many
		others, whose hilts have perished, by the marks they may have left a feature
		always to be looked for as soon as the blade is found. In the case of
		Asiatic daggers, which are nearly always tanged, no similar overlapping is
		observable. Often, however, a metal ferrule is fitted over the butt of the
		blade and the base of the hilt to mask and strengthen the join.</p>
		<p><img src="fig41-44.JPG" width="380" height="503" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Daggers, Ur, England, Sumeria" align="right">The earliest known Egyptian dagger, dating from Middle Predynastic times, is
		flat and triangular with a triangular heel, so that the blade as a whole
		is rhomboid. The earliest Mesopotamian daggers, on the contrary, are tanged and
		generally strengthened with a midrib (Fig. 43). Very early specimens are already ogival in outline. Throughout Asia Minor as far as Troy
		II daggers of the same general pattern are current.</p>
		<p>In Crete some Early Minoan daggers are flat and reminiscent of predynastic
		Egypt, but the midrib was soon employed, and examples with a broad, flat
		tang are quite early. The midrib was very pronounced also in Cypriote and
		Cycladic daggers. In Cyprus a very curious form grew up in which the midrib was prolonged into a long tang bent
		over at the top (Fig. 44). The type, which appeared already in Early
		Aegean times and lasted till the Late Mycenaean period in the island, was
		exported to Palestine, Syria, Anatolia and Hungary.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#14" name="14b">[14]</a></sup></font> Weapons, of very
		similar form but with slits in the blade, as if they had been hafted as spearheads, are known from the Cyclades and Troy II.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#15" name="15b">[15]</a></sup></font></p>
		<p>In Middle Aegean times ogival daggers were in use both in Crete and by the
		Minyans of Greece. In MM I deposits we meet a tanged ogival dagger with slight flanges round the shoulders and bordering the tang. It formed the
		starting point for an important series of daggers and rapiers of later Minoan times. The flanges, of course, served to keep in place the plates of wood or
		ivory that formed the grip of the hilt.</p>
		<p>The regular series of continental European daggers begins in the Early Bronze
		Age with a small flat triangular round-heeled blade, often adorned with
		groups of grooves parallel to the edges (Fig. 42). Before the end of the
		period such weapons were being provided with hilts of bronze, cast
		separately, in North Italy, the Rhone valley and Central Europe (Fig. 45). In Germany imitations were manufactured with hilts cast in one piece
		with the blades. From Brittany and England a couple of contemporary daggers
		have survived whose wooden hilts were studded with hundreds of tiny gold
		nails.</p>
		<p><img src="fig46-51.JPG" width="492" height="354" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Daggers, Crete, Mycenae, Germany, " align="right">During the Middle Bronze Age an ogival dagger or short sword was evolved out of
		the foregoing types in the Rhone valley, preserving their
		characteristic decoration, rounded heel and flat section. The standard
		Central European type of this period, however, may have had a different
		origin, for it has an angular trapeze-shaped butt, and often a distinct, if generally broad and low, midrib and lacks
		all ornamentation (Fig. 46). In the earlier specimens<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#15" name="15c">[15]</a></sup></font> the
		heel is relatively broad and carries six rivets ; later it is narrowed down and
		the number of rivets reduced till in the Late Bronze Age only two
		survive. In the latter period, too, a few specimens with flanged tangs,
		inspired by Mycenaean models, appear.</p>
		<h4>RAPIERS</h4>
		<p class="fst">Rapiers, as noted, appear to be an Aegean invention. Orientals shrank from the
		close fighting in which alone such weapons are useful, while the
		continental barbarians of Europe lacked as yet the metallurgical skill
		necessary for their forging. The earliest known rapier, recently found at
		Mallia in Crete and dating from MM I (circa 1950BC) is over 90cm long. The
		blade has a stout, wide midrib. The hilt, of ivory plated with gold,
		meets the blade in a slightly convex line (an Asiatic as opposed to Egyptian
		feature) and is surmounted by a long pear-shaped pommel of crystal (also
		very Sumerian looking.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#16" name="16b">[16]</a></sup></font> The regular Minoan series only begins some centuries
		later with the Shaft Graves of Mycenae belonging to the close of MM III (about 1600BC). By that date three distinct types are known: (I) a
		relatively flat blade of elongated ogival outline with a flat tang (Fig. 47); huge tapering blades with a skewer-like midrib terminating either, (IIa) in a round heel from which projects a short narrow tang (Fig. 48), or (II ) in a square butt with wider tang, both shoulders and tang being
		flanged (Fig. 49). All were balanced by heavy pommels of crystal or
		semi-precious stone to receive which a spur projects from the tang of IIb. The
		latter 's grip consisted of plates, let in between the hilt's flanges and held in place by large
		gold-capped rivets. The grip of IIa was supported by gold mounts
		fitting over the heel. These already have projections at the shoulder serving
		as guards to divert from the gripping hand the adversary's weapon when
		the rapier was parrying a thrust. A short length of the edges, just below the
		butt, was intentionally blunted so that the thumb and forefinger of the
		swordsman's hand might rest there a feature (known as the ricassodi).</p>
		<p><img src="fig52-56.JPG" width="538" height="479" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Rapiers and swords, Hungary, Germany, Bavaria, Switzerland " align="right">Later, the flanges on the shoulder of type IIb were developed into lateral
		horn-like (LM II and LM. IIIa) or cruciform (LM. III) projections
		likewise serving as guards<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#17" name="17b">[17]</a></sup></font> (Fig. 50). Late in LM IIIa, too, the
		flange was carried right round the hilt so as to support also the
		pommel. One or two rapiers of the last-named variety have been found north of
		the Alps towards the close of the Middle Bronze Age.</p>
		<p>The continental European rapiers that begin in the Middle Bronze Age might be
		regarded as mere prolongations of the ogival dagger. The early
		specimens have six rivet-holes for the attachment of the hilt (Fig. 52).
		Such weapons, which rarely reach a length of 60cm, are common in
		Central Europe and Scandinavia and even reach Great Britain. In the latter
		country two-piece moulds for their manufacture have actually been found. As
		in the case of the daggers, the butts of these weapons grew narrower as time
		went on, yielding in the Late Bronze Age a form with a tapering butt and
		three rivet-holes, well represented in South-west Germany, Switzerland and
		France and occurring sporadically in Hungary and Italy (Fig. 53). A
		contemporary Italian and French variant has a rod-like tang terminating in a
		hook rather like a Cypriote dagger. The above series was, I believe, inspired by Aegean models. Yet in
		South-eastern Spain we find, associated with Early Bronze Age celts and
		daggers, a short flat sword that is clearly just a magnified dagger, preserving
		the comparatively flat section and round heel of the Early Bronze Age
		type.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#18" name="18b">[18]</a></sup></font></p>
		<p>Some of the above-mentioned rapier types in Italy, Central Europe and
		Scandinavia are provided with bronze hilts, cast on, or cast in one piece with,
		the blade. Early in the Middle Bronze Age (Reinecke B) the hilts are
		cylindrical or, in South-west Germany, concave (Fig. 54). Later in the
		same
		period (Reinecke C) a type with octagonal hilt, richly decorated with engraved
		patterns, arose in the Upper Danube basin. Contem- porary Danish
		sword-hilts are superbly decorated with inlaid spiral patterns. Still later
		(Reinecke D) the hilts begin to swell out in the middle, but concurrent
		changes in the shape of the blade indicate that we are now dealing with a new
		weapon, the cut-and-thrust sword.</p>
		<h4>SWORDS</h4>
		<p class="fst"><img src="fig57-58.jpg" width="205" height="499" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Antennae sword, Switzerland; Hallstatt sword of bronze, Early Iron Age, Austria " align="right">All the weapons hitherto described were designed primarily for thrusting. None
		the less some of the bronze-hilted types from Scandinavia and Central
		Europe could also be swung. A real sword that can slash as well as thrust must
		have its centre of gravity shifted towards the blade, while for
		thrusting the weight had to be in the pommel. Certain long wide blades with a
		bulge half-way up and a short flat tang, found in Denmark, North Germany,
		Western Hungary and Upper Italy, seem to be aiming at this result. But a stroke
		imposes much greater strain on the joint between hilt and blade than
		does a thrust. The short-tanged type just described could no more grow into a reliable sword than the round- or
		square-heeled rapier.</p>
		<p>True swords seem to begin in a tanged blade whose flat tang and round shoulders
		are bordered with flanges, as in the Minoan rapiers classed as type II
	a. The form is certainly inspired by rapiers of this family, but the northern
		and Italian blades in question differ from the Aegean in that the edges
		are nearly parallel instead of tapering, and the midrib wide and flat so as not
		to impede a cut (Fig. 55). In what Kossinna<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#19" name="19b">[19]</a></sup></font> regards as the
		earliest type, appearing in Denmark according to Sophus Muller<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#20" name="20b">[20]</a></sup></font> in his
		period 2, there are no rivet-holes in the tang though there may be four in
		the heel; lead solder was sometimes used to keep in place the horn plates of
		the grip. This type occurs principally in Scandinavia, North-eastern
		Germany and Upper Italy. Some Central European swords with rivet-holes in the
		tang can hardly be later. They begin in the closing phase of the Middle
		Bronze Age and flourish in the Late Bronze Age. During the latter phase the
		blade tends to widen out to a leaf-shape a barbarous weapon adapted almost
		exclusively for hacking. In late versions (Reinecke E) nicks are seen just
		below the shoulder to guard the thumb and forefinger resting on the blunted
		edge (ricasso) above<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#21" name="21b">[21]</a></sup></font>. Others, however, say that the nicks served to
		prevent the blade joggling out of its scabbard. Sometimes also a spur projects
		from the end of the tang to hold the pommel. In some West European swords,
		belonging to a period subsequent to the pure Bronze Age, some of the
		rivet-holes are replaced by slits. In many of these West European swords the
		lower end of the blade has been narrowed down, apparently by filing away
		part of a leaf-shaped blade, with a most curious effect like a carp's tongue.</p>
		<p>Early versions of the flange-hilted leaf-shaped sword without any ricasso or
		even marked swelling in the blade are very common in Northern and Central
		Europe, Styria, Carniola and Bosnia and, as already remarked, even reached
		Greece and Egypt before 1200BC.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#22" name="22b">[22]</a></sup></font> The immense majority of the late
		versions, however, come from west of the Rhine, particularly from France and
		Britain. In the latter country they, with other exotic types, characterize
		the local Late Bronze Age which is really largely contemporary with the Early
		Iron Age of Central Europe. There, early in the Hallstatt period, our
		bronze swords had undergone a further modification, losing altogether the
		flanges round the hilt and acquiring instead a widened extension thereof to
		take a conical pommel. This is the true Hallstatt sword, represented by only a
		few stray examples in Britain (Fig. 58).</p>
		<p>Parallel to the flange-hilted sword go certain developments of the
		bronze-hilted rapiers whose blades have been assimilated to the leaf-shaped
		order.
		Two important types with a swelling bronze grip of flattened oval cross-
	section were developed in Switzerland. In one variant, termed the antennae
		sword (Fig. 57), the pommel consists of a stout bronze ribbon bent into
		opposing spirals. The type is common on both sides of the Alps and is
		found eastwards as far as Macedonia and Slovakia, northwards into Scandinavia
		and westwards as far as Lincolnshire. The other Swiss sword, known as the
		Morigen or Ronzano type, has a pommel shaped like an oval saucer (Fig. 56). Both types begin in the latter half of the Late Bronze Age, Reinecke
		E, and last into the succeeding phase of the Iron Age. Contemporary with them
		in Hungary went handsome swords with a swelling grip decorated with
		raised bands (representing the thongs that bound the plated hilts of the tanged swords) and
		surmounted with flat or saucer-shaped pommels. Such swords were
		exported from Hungary to Upper Italy, Eastern France, the Rhine valley and
		Eastern Galicia.</p>
		<h4><img src="fig59-61.jpg" width="342" height="369" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Chapes, Bavaria, Scotland" align="right">CHAPES</h4>
		<p class="fst">The rapiers and swords just described were normally carried in wooden sheathes
		which have naturally perished. We possess, however, some of the bronze
		chapes in which the scabbards terminated. The Middle Bronze Age chapes resemble
		little diamond-shaped snuffboxes or end in a loop (Fig. 59). The
		Hallstatt scabbards, on the contrary, ended in weird &#8220;winged&#8221; chapes, a few
		specimens of which reached Britain (Fig. 61). The type more common in
		Britain and France resembled the last named but was longer and lacked the great
		lateral wings (Fig. 60).</p>
		<h4>HALBERD (DOLCHSTAB)</h4>
		<p class="fst">The halberd is a peculiar weapon, distinctive of the Early Bronze Age in
		certain parts of Europe. It is essentially a triangular dagger hafted at right
		angles to a staff. Indeed a halberd can often be distinguished from a dagger
		only by observing that the mark left by the haft runs across the blade.
		Frequently, however, the halberd blade is asymmetrical, ie the triangle that
		would enclose it is scalene and not isosceles (Fig. 63).</p>
		<p>The weapon is believed to have originated in Southern Spain or Portugal, since
		certain flint blades found on Copper Age sites there may be best
		explained as halberds. It is in any case a regular element in the furniture
		of Early Bronze Age graves along the South-east coast of the peninsula;
		thence it seems to have reached Upper Italy, since a few specimens have been found there, and the weapon is depicted,
		brandished by warriors, on the rocks of the Ligurian Alps. Finally,
		there is one specimen, markedly asymmetrical and much incurved on the lower
		edge, from Shaft Grave IV at Mycenae. This halberd, though doubtless
		inspired by the western group, was a local product since its big rivet-heads
		have been gilded.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#23" name="23b">[23]</a></sup></font></p>
		<p><img src="fig62-64.jpg" width="244" height="368" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Halberds, Germany, Italy; Sword, Denmark" align="right">Westward from Spain the device was transmitted across the Atlantic to Ireland.
		A large number of specimens, mostly of copper, are known from the
		island. Many have a peculiar scythe-like outline. From Ireland a few halberds
		reached England and Scotland. Thence the type journeyed across the North
		Sea and up the Elbe where it was adopted in Saxo-Thuringia. Some early halberd
		blades here are decorated with incised lines like the contemporary
		daggers. Subsequently a localised variant was created: the haft was sheathed
		in metal and its head enveloped in a bronze cowl into which the blade was
		fitted. At first the blade was attached by rivets; in later specimens the cowl
		has been cast on but shows imitation rivet-heads moulded on its surface
		(Fig. 61). These Central German halberds found their way, presumably by
		trade, to Sweden, Lithuania and Slovakia. But the weapon was never
		adopted in Silesia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, South-western Germany or France.</p>
		<h4>SPEARHEADS</h4>
		<p class="fst">While metal was scarce, missile weapons would naturally be tipped with flint or
		horn points. At the same time the shorter forms of dagger could easily
		be converted into lance-heads by attachment to a long shaft. A blade intended
		specifically for a spearhead, however, would rather have the shape of a laurel or willow leaf. Some sort of
		tang was usually needed to facilitate union between the blade and the
		shaft. In Mesopotamia,<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#24" name="24b">[24]</a></sup></font> where the shafts (or at least the foreshafts) were
		normally made from hollow reeds, the tang was narrow and projected from
		a marked shoulder at the base of the blade that would engage the outer edge of
		the reed. The tang in the most popular variant is rectangular in section
		and tapers off below like a modern poker point. Hence the name &#8220;poker-butted
		spearhead&#8221; (Fig. 65). The type begins in Sumer before 3000BC and is found also in Elam, North Syria and beyond the Caucasus. In South Russia
		it persisted throughout the Copper Age into the belated Late Bronze Age
		(contemporary with the Hallstatt period).<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#25" name="25b">[25]</a></sup></font></p>
		<p><img src="fig65-70.jpg" width="426" height="478" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Spearheads, England, Sumeria, England, Scotland, Ireland" align="right">In Egypt a specialised spearhead of metal first appears in early dynastic
		times.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#26" name="26b">[26]</a></sup></font> The one specimen known to the author seems really to conform to
		the tanged pattern, though it is very rough, but is distinguished by a very
		broad ferrule of sheet copper that originally encircled both the split end
		of the shaft and the contained tang. But metal spearheads are very rare in
		Egypt till New Kingdom times.</p>
		<p>In the Cyclades during the Early Aegean period the shaft of split wood
		projected a long way down the blade, to which it was attached by thongs. A pair
		of slits were accordingly left in the blade to receive the bindings.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#27" name="27b">[27]</a></sup></font> From
		the islands the type spread to Troy II and across the Greek mainland to
		Levkas.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#28" name="28b">[28]</a></sup></font> Towards the close of Middle Helladic times this slitted spearhead
		gave birth to an odd form, confined to mainland Greece, in which the tip
		(or perhaps half the tip) of the shaft fitted into a shoe-like socket cast on
		one face of the blade. The principal development of the spearhead in the Aegean, however, starts with an Early Minoan type ending in a broad flat
		tang originally riveted into the shaft. During Middle Minoan times a
		tubular socket was formed by bending the edges of the tang round a mandril. The
		tube was later strengthened by forcing a cast ring over its lip.</p>
		<p>In Britain there are some kite-shaped blades of Early Bronze Age date
		terminating in a long, narrow, flat tang (Fig. 66). In at least one
		instance a ferrule had been fitted over the end of the shaft in which the tang
		was embedded so as to project over the blade (Fig. 67). Greenwell
		has suggested that a true socketed spearhead then developed through casting
		the ferrule in one piece with the blade and suppressing the tang<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#29" name="29b">[29]</a></sup></font>. The
		Arreton Down type of spearhead (so- called from a hoard found at that place in
		the Isle of Wight) conforms exactly to what might have been expected to
		result from this process. The majority of British spearheads of the Middle
		Bronze Age, however, agree with contemporary continental types. The blade
		is shaped like a laurel leaf, and the tube of the socket (formed by
		core-casting) extends well into the body of the blade and is continued
		externally as a midrib to the point. This form of head appears in Scandinavia, Central
		Europe, Hungary and Italy at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age. In the
		Late Bronze Age it tended to give way to a form with lanceolate blade. Both
		types were secured to the shaft by a pin through a hole in the socket.</p>
		<p>In Britain evolution followed different lines, a pair of loops developing on
		the socket through which thongs wrapped round the shaft could pass. These
		thongs took the place of rivets. In the earlier examples, associated in hoards
		with the older group of palstaves, and so of Middle Bronze Age date, the loops stand near the mouth of the socket (Fig. 68). This type is purely British, the few examples from North France
		being certainly imports from across the Channel, though single-eared
		spearheads occur in the &#8220;Copper Age&#8221; of South Russia. Later the loops approach
		the base of the blade and finally join on to it (Fig. 69). Examples even
		of the last phase are associated with rapiers. In our Late Bronze Age
		the loops have become either small eyelets near the base of the blade or
		semicircular slits, generally in the swelling part of a lanceolate blade. The
		small eyelets may still have had the same functional value as the ancestral
		loops. They can be paralleled on Sicilian and South Italian spear-heads of
		bronze belonging there already to the Early Iron Age. The curious semicircular
		openings (Fig. 70), however, can hardly have been designed for
		receiving binding thongs; there is in fact generally a rivet-hole in the socket
		of such spearheads. The type doubtless originated in the British
		Isles though a derivation from the Early Cycladic slitted form has been
		suggested by Coffey.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#30" name="30b">[30]</a></sup></font>0 From Britain specimens were exported as far as Huelva
		in Spain,<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#31" name="31b">[31]</a></sup></font> and the type somehow reached Central and Southern Russia. The
		idea was adopted and imitated there, moulds for the manufacture of the
		local variant having been found in the Ukraine.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#32" name="32b">[32]</a></sup></font></p>
		<h4>ARROWHEADS</h4>
		<p class="fst">Metal could only be used for arrowheads when it was very cheap. Actually flint
		and bone arrowheads remained current nearly everywhere throughout the
		Bronze Age. In Egypt and Crete flint lunates were employed to form transverse
		heads. In Middle Helladic and Mycenaean tombs we find superb hollow-based
		(barbed) arrowheads of flint or obsidian, and cruder variants on the same form
		are common in the Late Bronze Age urnfields of Central Europe. The
		finest stemmed and barbed arrowheads of Britain and France belong exclusively
		to the Bronze Age. Barbed bone tips are also found in the Late Bronze
		Age of Italy and Central Europe.</p>
		<p>Barbed metal arrowheads of various patterns but always with a long tapering
		tang are known from Egypt, Mycenaean Greece and Central Europe during the
		Middle and Late Bronze Age. In the last-named area the spur-like tang gradually
		gave way to a tubular socket. The Early Bronze Age graves of
		South-eastern Spain have yielded a peculiar barbless form with broad
		leaf-shaped head and a long tail-like tang. It must be remembered that bronze
		was still used for arrowheads quite late in the Iron Age.</p>
		<h4>KNIVES</h4>
		<p class="fst">Many flint knives of the Stone Age had probably been simply backed with wooden
		handles. Ground stone knives mounted in the same manner are known in
		Eastern Europe and Asia. A translation of such into metal would be just a strip
		of copper sharpened along one side by hammering. Such knife-blades with
		one or two rivet-holes in the back have actually been found in England, France
		and Central Russia, but generally in a Late Bronze Age context.</p>
		<p><img src="fig71-75.jpg" width="462" height="296" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Knives, Germany, Bohemia, Troy, Bavaria, Alsace" align="right">Such tools were extremely clumsy, yet it was no easy matter to attach a
		single-edged knife to a handle so that it should not waggle when pressure was
		put upon it, Hence single-bladed knives are a late feature. An early group,
		represented in Old Kingdom Egypt<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#33" name="33b">[33]</a></sup></font> and Troy II,<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#34" name="34b">[34]</a></sup></font> solved the problem
		by prolonging the back of the blade to form a narrow tapering tang on to which a tubular handle of
		wood or bone was fitted (Fig. 71). In Greece such implements do not
		appear before Middle Aegean times. Then the hilt was attached by from three to
		five rivets (not all in a straight line) to a wide butt without the use
		of a tang.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#35" name="35b">[35]</a></sup></font> Later a broad tang was used to support the handle.</p>
		<p>In Central Europe single-edged knives appear first towards the close of the
		Middle Bronze Age. All have arched backs, the handle being either attached
		by a rivet to a spur continuing the line of the back (Fig. 72) or cast
		in one piece with the blade. In the Late Bronze Age the variety of types
		is multiplied. The blade is either straight or recurved. The handle may be of
		bronze terminating in a loop and inlaid on either face with horn plates
		held in position by a series of metal tabs; alternatively a wooden handle was
		fitted into a tubular socket (Fig. 75) or, as in the previous
		period, on to a long spur (Fig. 76). In Switzerland was manufactured
		the curious variant of the latter group, with a section of solid metal
		where the ball of the hand rested, shown in (Fig. 77). The type, that
		belongs to Reinecke's phase E, was exported as far as Silesia, Hungary and
		Central France.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#36" name="36b">[36]</a></sup></font></p>
		<p><img src="fig76-80.JPG" width="553" height="319" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Knives, Switzerland, England, Scotland" align="right">In Great Britain single-edged knives are virtually unknown. But it must be
		remembered that the short daggers could be, and doubtless were, used as
		knives. They are indeed often termed, very properly, knife-daggers. In fact
		some protodynastic Egyptian, Late Minoan and Early Bronze Age British &#8220;daggers&#8221; are rounded off at the point so that their use as daggers is excluded.</p>
		<p>In the British Isles the round-pointed knives of the Early Bronze Age, that
		with their round heels and numerous rivets are so patently allied to the more pointed &#8220;daggers&#8221;, form the
		starting-point for two specialised knives of our Late Bronze Age. The
		first has a long blade and a short flat tang, nearly as wide as the blade, that
		generally bears two rivets (Fig. 78). The second, but that it
		is found associated with the first, might be regarded as evolved therefrom by
		the addition of a ferrule like the socketed spearheads of the Arreton
		Down class; for it is characterised by an elliptical socket with one or two
		pairs of rivet-holes, that looks just what might have developed out of such
		a combination with the hypothetical ferrule (Fig. 79). Such forms, though
		commonest in the British Isles and probably native there, are also
		found in Northern France and as far south as Charente.</p>
		<p>Related to our socketed knives is a curious socketed instrument whose
		leaf-shaped blade is bent round in a semicircle. Outside Great Britain the type
		is found in Normandy and perhaps Switzerland (Fig. 80).</p>
		<h4>RAZORS</h4>
		<p class="fst">It is quite possible to shave with a flint blade, and some predynastic flints
		were undeniably utilised in this way. The early Egyptian metal razors
		exactly copy these flint forms. One type, confined to the Early Dynastic
		period, was rectangular with four bevelled edges. Another form, going back to
		Late Predynastic times, looks like a broad double-edged knife with a short
		tang. Probably most were sharpened along one edge only, as is certainly the
		case with the specimens from Queen Hetep-heres' tomb. A very similar little
		implement has recently been found in early Sumerian tombs. The
		Mesopotamian razors, always unfortunately in bad preservation, are regularly
		found in pairs; it is uncertain whether both edges were sharp. In the Aegean area the earliest certain razors
		date from the LM III period. The majority are one-edged (Fig. 81) but there are double-edged specimens in which the handle was riveted
		directly on to the blade without a tang.</p>
		<p><img src="fig81-86.JPG" width="384" height="497" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Razors, Sicily, Zafer Papoura, Bohemia, Upper Italy" align="right">The majority of European razors belong to the same family. In the earlier
		graves of the so-called Siculan II period, containing Mycenaean vases
		imported from Greece, we find a long blade with slightly concave sides and an
		indentation at the lower end (Fig. 83). The purpose of the indent
		was perhaps to allow the forefinger to feel the skin while shaving. In any case
		it is a prominent feature in nearly all European double-edged razors.
		In contemporary North Italian implements the indent is much more pronounced,
		and, above, a wide slit separates the two blades. An openwork handle,
		generally terminating in a loop and cast in one piece with the blade, was
		attached to these Italian razors (Fig. 85). They belong to the Middle
		Bronze Age. Rather later a small group of razors appears in Franconia and
		Western Bohemia with a very broad double-edged blade, sometimes at least
		divided by a slit near the end, and an openwork handle cast in one piece with
		it (Fig. 86). Crude razors of this pattern are found at a
		relatively later date in Holland and Eastern France (Nievre and Rhone).
		But the contemporary Central European razors of phase E have already
		grown into developed horseshoe-shaped blades (Fig. 87).</p>
		<p>In Upper Italy, on the other hand, during the Late Bronze Age and first phase
		of the Early Iron Age (Villanova culture), the razor assumes a
		rectangular outline, preserving the indent in the lower end as an almost
		circular aperture and provided with a loop of twisted wire riveted on to the blade as handle (Fig. 88). The same type
		is found in South Italy and Sicily, but in that island a type, derived
		from the earlier native form, but with wider blade, more pronounced slit
		between he edges and a flat tang for handle, is also encountered in the later
		tombs of the Siculan II period. Similar forms occur in Southern France (Arige
		and Charente) and probably give a clue to the ancestry of our British
		razors.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#37" name="37b">[37]</a></sup></font></p>
		<p>The latter resemble a maple leaf in form. A tang to take the handle projects
		from the base of the blade and is often continued downwards by a wide
		midrib along its face. In the opposite end is a deep V-shaped indent and just
		behind it a circular eyelet. Though generally Late Bronze Age in date,
		one such blade, though without the round eyelet, was found with rapiers and
		palstaves in Scotland.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#38" name="38b">[38]</a></sup></font> It is generally believed that these razors
		belong to the group of foreign forms introduced into Britain by invaders
		arriving at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. The affinities of our razors
		in any case seem to lie rather with Sicily and the Western Mediterranean than
		with the countries east of the Rhine.</p>
		<p><img src="fig87-91.JPG" width="424" height="437" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Razors, Germany, Siculian, Villanova, England, Denmark" align="right">While the standard European razors of the Bronze Age were double-edged, there
		is a series in Scandinavia with only one blade. Such are doubtless in the
		last resort derived from the normal Mycenaean implement (Fig. 91).</p>
		<h4>TWEEZERS</h4>
		<p class="fst">Another surer but certainly more painful method of removing the facial hairs
		was to pull them out with tweezers. Depilatory tweezers, formed
		essentially of a bronze ribbon bent double and rather wider at the ends than at the middle, were largely used in predynastic Egypt and precede razors
		in Crete and the Cyclades, appearing there in Early Aegean times. In
		Central Europe and Scandinavia, tweezers, allied to the foregoing, were
		adopted in the Middle Bronze Age, slightly preceding the razors, though
		curiously enough razors and tweezers are not seldom found together in the same
		grave. Such metal tweezers are very rare in Britain but appear at the
		same time as the razors in the Late Bronze Age.</p>
		<p>A different type of tweezer, consisting of two strips of metal brazed together,
		was current in Mesopotamia and India about 3000BC. They are found as
		components of toilet-sets, hung on a ring together with a pricking instrument
		and an ear-scoop.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#39" name="39b">[39]</a></sup></font> As their ends are very narrow, these Asiatic
		tweezers probably served a different purpose to the Egyptian, perhaps catching
		lice. Structurally, a curious pair of bone tweezers from an Early Bronze
		Age grave in England resembles the Asiatic group.</p>
		<h4>SICKLES</h4>
		<p class ="fst">All metal sickles go back in the last resort to the so-called jawbone sickle
		formed by inserting serrated flint blades into the dental cavity of some
		domestic animal. No jawbones thus equipped have ever been found, but Egypt has
		yielded a wooden mount, armed with flints, shaped in imitation of a
		jawbone, and similarly formed clay sickles are common in prediluvian deposits
		in Mesopotamia. As a result of this origin a hollow arc-shaped cutting
		edge is universal in the metal sickles, but three main groups can be
		distinguished by the method of hafting the blade.</p>
		<p>In the oldest Mesopotamian metal sickle the blade was continued into a flat tang which was doubled over to form a loop. The same
		type is found in Anatolia in Troy VI, and a variant appears in the Late
		Bronze Age of the Caucasus and Transylvania.</p>
		<p>In the commonest North European type, found also in Southern Germany, Bohemia,
		Eastern France and England, there is no tang. The blade is reinforced by
		a couple of ridges parallel to it on the back, and the handle is attached with
		the aid of a knob projecting on one face near the butt. It is therefore
		termed the button sickle (Fig. 92). This type certainly goes back to the
		Middle Bronze Age.</p>
		<p><img src="fig92-95.JPG" width="370" height="547" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Sickles, Transylvania, England, Italy, Ireland" align="right">During the Late Bronze Age it was replaced in France and Central Europe by a
		type of Italian or Hungarian origin. In the latter the form of the blade
		is the same, but the button is replaced by a wide tang that makes an angle with
		the blade. The handle was attached by a rivet and is kept in place by a
		pair of ridges running along the edges of the tang (Fig. 93).</p>
		<p>The socketed sickle may have been evolved out of the foregoing, since its
		tubular socket makes a similar angle with the blade. The type was certainly
		invented in the British Isles where it is common in hoards of the Late Bronze
		Age (Fig. 94). Stray specimens, presumably British exports, occur
		beyond the Channel in Northern France, the Swiss lake-dwellings and Upper
		Italy. The device even reached Sardinia where a local variant on it occurs.</p>
		<h4>HARNESS</h4>
		<p class="fst">The harnessing of animal motive power was, as already remarked, one of the most
		momentous achievements of the Bronze Age. Yet of all the gear that
		must have been used in the application of that new motive power the only recognisable elements that have come down to us from Bronze Age
		Europe are bits, or to be exact, portions of bits.</p>
		<p>It is still uncertain how the Sumerians controlled the asses that drew their
		early chariots. Even as late as the Eighteenth Dynasty in Egypt it is
		possible that the chariot horses were governed merely by nose-ropes; for though
		several royal tombs have yielded us chariots and harness, no bits have
		as yet come to light. The earliest known metal bit comes from a Late Mycenaean
		tomb at Mycenae. Like modern bits, it consisted of a jointed metal rod
		that passed between the horse's jaws. But in addition it was equipped at either
		end with flat pieces of metal, termed cheek-pieces, to which the reins
		were attached by loops. When the reins were drawn tight the cheek-pieces would
		compress the animal's jaws, the pain in the case before us being
		augmented by metal spikes on the inner faces of the cheek-pieces.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#40" name="40b">[40]</a></sup></font></p>
		<p><img src="fig96-98.jpg" width="341" height="380" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Harness, Britain, Swiss lakes" align="right">No such metal bits are known during the pure Bronze Age of continental Europe.
		But from the &#8220;terremare&#8221; of Upper Italy and Middle Bronze Age deposits
		in Hungary, Germany and Sweden we possess pieces of tine or horn with several
		perforations that are believed to have been attached as cheek-pieces to
		the ends of a bar of wood or a stout twisted strip of hide that constituted the
		bit proper (Fig. 97). Similar horn cheek-pieces become quite
		common in the Late Bronze Age and even reach Britain in company with other
		continental types. But in Switzerland and Scandinavia by that phase of the
		Late Bronze Age, termed by Reinecke Hallstatt A (Bronze Age E), and in the
		contemporary Early Iron Age deposits of Upper Italy, bronze bits were being
		already manufactured. These all have metal cheek-pieces, generally bent rods with loops at the sides or slits through them to take the reins (Fig. 98). Only later in the Hallstatt period do we meet examples of the modern
		form of bit terminating in rings.</p>
		<h4>ORNAMENTS</h4>
		<p class="fst">The ornaments worn during the Bronze Age are far too varied to be discussed in
		detail. They are, moreover, specialised into local groups that can best
		be mentioned later in dealing with the several cultures. Some, however, throw
		a unique light on cultural relations or serve as invaluable chronological guides. Such must be briefly described here.</p>
		<h4>PINS</h4>
		<p class="fst">Pins were used for fastening garments over a curiously restricted area during
		the earlier parts of the Bronze Age. Their use must obviously be
		correlated with a particular costume an untailored cloak or mantle, worn over
		the shoulders and fastened in front by one or two pins. As a matter of
		fact ancient representations or lucky finds in peat-bogs afford positive proof
		of the wearing of such a garb among the Sumerians and the prehistoric
		Danes. Pins, and the dress they imply, were worn in Mesopotamia from the
		earliest Sumerian times and then throughout Asia Minor and Anatolia. They were
		also freely used in the Cyclades and on the Greek mainland during Early Aegean
		times, but only very rarely and in an immature form in Crete. Pins are
		equally rare in centres of metallurgy connected with maritime trade westward
		Sicily, Sardinia, Spain and Britain. On the other hand they were adopted
		together with metallurgy in Central Europe, whence the local types spread
		widely as a result of ethnic movements.</p>
		<p><img src="fig99-104.JPG" width="415" height="405" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Pins, Kish, Ur, Germany, Bohemia" align="right">To keep the pin in position a thread was passed through or tied on to its head,
		looped round the fold of the stuff to be fastened, and the end wound round the shaft again. The devices employed for attaching the thread provide
		the most workable basis for a classification of pins.</p>
		<h5>(l) PINS WITH LOOPED HEADS</h5>
		<p class="fst">In this class the head itself is a loop through which the thread may be passed.
		The simplest way of making such a pin is to take a piece of wire and
		bend over the top end or head. Generally the head is hammered out flat before
		being bent over.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#41" name="41b">[41]</a></sup></font> The result is termed a roll-head pin (<i>Rollennadel</i>)
		(Fig. 99). Such are found from the earliest times in Sumer and throughout the Asiatic Bronze Age province and its Central and North European
		extensions. A natural development of this is the shepherd's crook pin
		distinctive of the Bronze Age in East Central Europe. A roll-head pin might be
		made more ornate by simply widening the flat head. From merely broadening the
		head materially in this way arises the racket pin (<i>Rudernadel</i>}. This
		variant is found in Sumer before 3000BC (Fig. 101), then in the Early
		and Middle Bronze Ages of Hungary and Central Europe and later in the
		Caucasus. In the Early Bronze Age of Central Europe the decorative effect was
		further enhanced by trimming off the angles of the flat plate till it
		became a perfect circle (a little tang being left projecting opposite the shaft
		to form the loop), the disk pin (<i>Scheibennadel</i>). The disk is often
		decorated with an engraved cross. By casting the disk as an openwork wheel with an ear to represent the original folded loop, the wheel pin
		was created in the Rhine valley during the Middle Bronze Age (Fig. 102). The type was exported throughout Central Europe as far as Upper Italy,
		Poland and Denmark.</p>
		<p>An earlier variant of the disk pin, also formed by trimming up a racket pin,
		was the trefoil pin of the Rhone valley. The bilobate and trilobate pins
		of the Middle Bronze Age in Upper Italy may be derived from it in the same way
		as the wheel pin from the disk type.</p>
		<p>A safer loop might be produced on a wire pin by bending the top over and
		twisting it round the shaft, producing the knot-headed pin (<i>Schleifennadel</i>). The principle was known both in predynastic Egypt, in early Sumer and in
		prehistoric cities on the Indus. It was applied to the manufacture of pins in
		Cyprus and Troy II. Thence the type was diffused up the Danube to Hungary,
		Bohemia and Silesia, where it became common from the beginning of the age of
		metals and throughout the Middle Bronze Age (Fig. 103). By imitating the
		knot-headed pin in a casting the Aunjetitz pin (<i>Bohmische Osennadef</i>) was
		created in Bohemia. It had an inverted conical head surmounted by a cast loop
		or ear (Fig. 104). The ring-headed pin seems a later derivative of
		the same fundamental type.</p>
		<h5>(2) TOGGLE OR EYELET PINS</h5>
		<p class="fst">In a second series the thread was passed through a hole in the pin-shaft near
		its head. The shaft had generally to be widened where it was pierced.
		In Mesopotamia by 3000BC it was hammered out flat, and the flattened surface
		perforated (Fig, 100). The wide flat part, often called the neck,
		is frequently engraved with crosses and herring-bone patterns. Above the neck the shaft was
		normally bent over. It was generally surmounted with a globular bead of
		lapis. Eyelet pins with bulbous, or in Cyprus mushroom, heads, cast in one
		piece with the shaft, very early found acceptance in Syria, Cyprus, Troy and
		South Russia. Eyelet pins did not reach Central Europe till the Middle Bronze
		Age, but are very characteristic of that period. The round swollen necks
		of these pins are decorated with just the same herring-bone and cruciform
		patterns as the Sumerian pins of the fourth millennium.</p>
		<p><img src="fig105-109.jpg" width="381" height="434" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Pins, Ireland, Alsace, Bohemia, Bavaria, England" align="right">In South Germany the eyelet pins seldom have a specialised head. In Hungary, on
		the other hand, they are surmounted with mushroom heads. In some mushroom pins the eyelet is formed by a spur projecting from the side of the shaft
		to meet the (separately cast) head. Allied to these is a form belonging
		to the very end of the Middle Bronze Age: the flat disk head is cast apart
		from the shaft and with a socket fitted on to the bent shaft so that the
		latter is parallel to the plane of the disk. The eye is formed by a looped
		strand of finer wire, one end of which was cast on to the shaft, the other
		tucked into the head's socket (Fig. 105). In its Bohemian home the disk
		was generally decorated with an engraved star pattern. A variant with no
		loop or eyelet reached Scandinavia in the latest Bronze Age there (Montelius IV
		and V) and Great Britain. These late pins, termed sunflower pins, are
		decorated only with concentric circles upon the disk (Fig. 106). The
		sunflower pin is the only type at any time at all common in the British
		Isles till our own Iron Age began.</p>
		<p>Allied to the pins with perforated neck is a rare type with a lateral loop on
		the neck. It is found occasionally in Early Bronze Age graves in North Syria. Then there are isolated examples
		from Bohemia belonging to the very end of the Middle Bronze Age, from
		Denmark later still, from the great Iron Age cemetery at Hallstatt in Upper
		Austria and from France undated. Yet the type has been found in Scotland
		in company with Middle Bronze Age rapiers and palstaves and a razor (Fig. 107).</p>
		<p>Carefully to be distinguished from the foregoing is the &#8220;East German eyelet
		pin&#8221; found in the Late Bronze Age urnfields. Its distinctive feature is a
		lateral spur on the neck perforated with a hole parallel to the shaft. It is
		probably derived from a pin common in Hungary and Central Europe in the
		Early and Middle Bronze Ages with a bulbous head perforated with a hole running
		down from the crown to the side of the shaft. This type may be inspired
		by Syrian bulb-headed pins.</p>
		<h5>(3) PINS WITH MERELY DECORATIVE HEADS</h5>
		<p class="fst">In a third family of pins the securing thread was merely twisted round the
		head; the latter, therefore, need not be perforated but is generally
		decorative. From ancient Sumerian and Early Cycladic graves come pins with
		animal heads, while others from Troy II were surmounted by miniature
		vases. In an important group extending from Turkestan to Italy the head is just
		a spiral disk. In some Early Cycladic specimens two spirals sprout out
		from the top of the shaft, and the same happens in Italy during the Middle
		Bronze Age and then in Central Europe, where spiral-headed pins are late in
		the Late Bronze Age.</p>
		<p>Indeed, throughout continental Europe loops and eyelets went out of fashion
		during the Late Bronze Age.	The older eyelet pins are replaced by forms, often of gigantic size, with a
		collar of ribs or a big head in the shape of a vase, a poppy-head, a turban
		or a globe. Very distinctive of the second phase of the Late Bronze Age (Kraft
		E) are the Swiss pins whose globular heads are adorned with inlaid
		&#8220;eyes&#8221;. Later, fashions changed again; the giant types disappear, and the
		heads of the rest shrink.</p>
		<h4>SAFETY-PINS OR FIBULAE</h4>
		<p class="fst">A logical corrolary of the pins kept in position by a loop of thread round the
		fold of clothing pierced by the pin was the safety-pin or brooch,
		technically known by the Latin name of fibula. There are two methods by which a
		safety-pin might be arrived at. You might take a wiry pin and bend back
		the top of the shaft over the fold of clothing to meet the lower part of the
		shaft and catch the point. Alternatively the thread passing through the
		eyelet of a toggle pin might be replaced by a length of wire which would
		likewise be twisted so as to catch the point. The first plan produces our
		safety- pin or one-piece fibula; the alternative gives rise to the so-called
		two-membered safety-pin. These two series seem to be independent, but both
		start about the same time, Middle Bronze Age or circa 1350BC, and moreover
		at opposite ends of the amber trade route. The one-piece safety-pin
		originated in Italy, Bohemia, or, on the latest theory, Mycenaean Greece; the
		two-membered fibula started about the same time in Denmark. It is
		therefore on the face of it unlikely that the two types are really autonomous
		and spontaneous growths.</p>
		<h4>ONE-PIECE SAFETY-PINS</h4>
		<p class="fst"><img src="fig110-112.jpg" width="306" height="410" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Safety pins (fibulae), Switzerland, Hungary, Italy" align="right">In Late Minoan Crete people wore long pins, with a twisted shaft but no
		distinct head, whose upper parts were just hooked over. Blinkenberg<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#42" name="42b">[42]</a></sup></font> and
		Myres<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#43" name="43b">[43]</a></sup></font> believe that these pins were turned into fibulae by the simple
		expedient of bending the upper end into a hook to catch and also guard the
		point. This terminal hook is thus the prototype of the catch-plate. To make a
		really workable safety-pin the simple hooked end had to be modified so as
		to give a protection to the point, and a spring had to be introduced to bring
		the point back into the catch. The fibulae from pure LM IIIa tombs in
		Greece have a bow parallel to the pin and a catch-plate formed either by
		hammering out the end of the wire flat or by coiling it in a spiral (Fig. 110). Such fibulae are known as the violin-bow type and form the
		starting-point for several series, developing along divergent lines in different
		regions. The greater part of this evolution lies outside the scope of this
		book, in the Iron Age, but some early forms may be sketched here.</p>
		<p>Violin-bow fibulae, representing the primary stage of the safety-pin, are found
		outside Greece in Middle Bronze Age deposits in Italy and Sicily, and
		rather later in Bosnia, the Tyrol and Switzerland. There are two specimens from
		Central Europe, alleged to come from Early Bronze Age graves, but the
		circumstances of their discovery are doubtful.</p>
		<p>The changes affect principally the form of the bow, aiming at making it more
		ornate or capable of catching a thicker fold of clothing. In Greece during
		the Mycenaean period the bow was widened to a leaf-shape. Rather later a
		series of figure-8 twists were introduced in the wire bow. The latter type occurs on both sides of the Adriatic and in
		North-western Hungary (Fig. 112). In the last-named region it gave
		rise to a series of highly elaborate variants in the Late Bronze Age and
		Hallstatt period.</p>
		<p>The main direction of evolution went towards increasing the space between pin
		and bow to allow of more stuff being gripped. This was effected by four
		methods, giving rise to four main families that constitute the second
		evolutionary phase: A1, prolonging the catch-plate vertically, giving the
		asymmetrical bow fibula; A2, bending the bow into a semicircle, producing the
		arc fibula; A3, twisting the bow up into an elbow and elongating the
		stilt, yielding the elbow and serpentine fibulae, or A4, adding coils to the
		spring, leading to the harp fibula. Of these only the last version
		preserves the spiral catch-plate. The first two, on the other hand, as well as
		some late violin-bow types, may have small shoulders or beads at either
		end of the bow.</p>
		<p>The arc fibula (Fig. 111) appears in Greece already during LM IIIb
		times and in the Late Bronze Age of Italy and Bosnia, and leads to many
		variants in the Iron Age. The elbow fibula (a gomito] (Fig. 113) is
		found in Sicily in graves of the Siculan II period slightly later than those
		containing Mycenaean vases. In the Early Iron Age of Cyprus a kindred form is
		found. A rather later Sicilian type (<i>serpeggianti ad occhio</i>) introduces a
		second loop at the root of the stilt where the elbow comes. It seems influenced
		by a version of the arc fibula, with a loop at the base of the
		catch-plate, found during the Early Iron Age in Crete and Illyria. Finally the
		harp fibula, appearing in a rudimentary form in the latest Bronze Age of
		Styria, characterises the early Hallstatt period in the Eastern Alps and Lower Austria. Contemporary with it in Styria appears the earliest
		spectacle brooch, a type distinctive of the true Hallstatt culture and of
		the Geometric period in Greece. It consists of a strand of wire coiled into a
		pair of spiral disks ; from the centre of one the wire, sharpened to make
		the pin, is brought back across the other to engage in its end.</p>
		<p><img src="fig113-115.jpg" width="356" height="447" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Safety pins (fibulae), Siculian, Denmark" align="right">The modifications introduced during phase III of the safety-pin's evolution
		include, in the case of arc fibulae, threading beads on to the bow or
		imitating such in metal bulbs cast on it (Greece and Italy), widening the
		catch-plate (Greece and Illyria) or lengthening it (Italy), introducing a
		second loop at the root of the catch-plate (Greece and Illyria, also Sicily),
		decorating the bows with raised ribs (Upper Italy and Switzerland), etc.</p>
		<p>These three stages can be approximately dated. Stage I is purely Mycenaean and
		accordingly begins before 1300BC; even stage II began before the end
		of the Mycenaean age, about 1100; while stage III was already well advanced in
		sub-Mycenaean times by 1000BC.</p>
		<h4>TWO-MEMBER FIBULAE</h4>
		<p class="fst">The evolution of the two-piece fibulae follows in the main the same lines as
		that of the one-member group. During the first or Middle Bronze Age phase
		(Sophus Muller<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#44" name="44b">[44]</a></sup></font>) the bow, either of twisted wire or leaf-shaped, is parallel
		to the pin and ends in two spiral disks or just two hooks. The pin is
		just a normal toggle pin with swollen, perforated neck and simple, club-shaped
		head (Fig. 114). This stage is virtually confined to Denmark.
		During the Late Bronze Age divergent developments set in as the device spread.
		In Scandinavia and North Germany the speciality of the Swiss lake-dwellings during the last phase of the Bronze Age (Kraft E).</p>
		<p>Bracelets with spiral ends were characteristic of East Central Europe, Hungary,
		Galicia, East Germany and Scandinavia during the Middle and Late Bronze
		Age. The most handsome Middle Bronze Age type in the former area terminates in
		opposed spiral disks. Such rings were worn on the upper arm as the
		traces of wear indicate. Later Hungarian specimens, belonging already to phase
		E of the Bronze Age, have double-spiral ends. A variant, also with
		double-spiral ends but a ribbon- like body decorated with cast horizontal ribs
		or engraved triangles, is, however, found already in Middle Bronze Age
		deposits of Scandinavia, South-west Germany and Bohemia.</p>
		<p>Two types of bracelet formed from a doubled piece of wire deserve notice. In
		the variety current in Central Europe from Early Bronze Age times the ends
		of the wire are twisted; in a British type of the Middle Bronze Age, the loop
		where the wire is bent back is relatively wide and the ends are twisted
		over and hooked into it (Fig. 120). Neither type is penannular; both
		approximate rather to the cylinders.</p>
		<p>Broad armlets of plate bronze, even in width all over and decorated with cast
		horizontal ribs or engraved triangles, appear already in the Early Bronze
		Age of Central Europe. Analogous types, generally narrower and with sharper
		ridges, are found in contemporary deposits in France and Britain. Such wide
		armlets may have taken the place of the stone wrist-guards worn by the archers
		of the Bell-beaker culture in the Copper Age to protect them from the
		recoil of the bow-string. The horizontally ribbed armlet persists into the
		Late Bronze Age, even reaching Scandinavia. But the later Central European specimens generally have rounded ends (Fig. 119).</p>
		<p>East of the Rhine the tendency was to replace broad armlets by cylinders.
		Cylinders of narrow copper ribbon had been worn even in the Copper Age and,
		made of stouter ribbon, appear in Early Bronze Age hoards. By the Middle Bronze
		Age they had become very popular, particularly in East Germany and Hungary. Here the ribbon, hammered out to nearly an inch or so in width, is
		decorated with punctured patterns and strengthened with a midrib which is
		prolonged beyond either end of the ribbon and coiled into spiral disks. The
		type outlasts the Bronze Age and reappears in Early Iron Age graves in
		Italy and the Caucasus. Cylinders of the same structure could be worn on the
		legs.</p>
		<p>A series of anklets, developed in the Upper Rhine valley, is interesting owing
		to its well-marked typoogical evolution. The oldest form, going back
		to Reinecke's phase B, is a simple piece of stout wire coiled into spiral disks
		at either end. Next, the wire body is replaced by narrow ribbon, the
		spiral ends remaining wiry. Finally in phases D and E the ribbon of the body is
		widened and the wiry ends are bent back and carried round for one turn
		before being coiled into spirals (Fig. 121). This late type reaches the
		Upper Danube on the one hand and the French Departments of Aube, Marne
		and Cote d'Or on the other.</p>
		<p>There remains a series of ornaments with wiry bodies, worn principally on the
		neck, which are of special importance owing to early parallels on the
		fringes of the Oriental civilisations. A penannular ring of stout wire with the
		ends hammered flat and bent back into loops (Fig. 122) is represented by a number of
		specimens in a hoard found at Byblos in North Syria and dated roughly about
		1800BC. There are stray specimens from Egypt of a similar age, and later
		the type was common in the Caucasus. Just the same rings are found in the very
		earliest Bronze Age deposits of Hungary and Central Europe. Here they
		were sometimes worn as collars and  used as ingots.
		They are therefore termed ingot torques. From Central Europe the type
		reached the valleys of the Rhine and Rhone. Ingot torques remained current
		throughout the Bronze Age, but some of the later specimens are made of
		twisted rectangular wire,<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#45" name="45b">[45]</a></sup></font> a feature also observed on certain early Syrian
		specimens. The effect of torsion was imitated in casting on some European
		examples.</p>
		<p>A series of ingot torques diminishing in size might be fastened together by
		pins through the terminal loops to form gorgets. Composite gorgets of this
		pattern are actually found as late as phase E in South-west Germany. But
		imitations thereof in sheet bronze with the ends rolled up into tubes were
		current in Switzerland and Scandinavia during the Middle Bronze Age. The Swiss
		collars are decorated with engraved rectilinear patterns and maintain
		the same width throughout their circumference. The Scandinavian, on the other
		hand, are shaped so as to be widest in the middle. The earlier ones
		show horizontal ribs in front, reminiscent of the originally separate
		neck-rings, but panels at either end are richly ornamented with engraved
		spirals. Related to the foregoing are some collars of thin sheet gold from Brittany and
		Portugal. Instead of ribs, these exhibit front, slits, reproducing the effect of the originally separate rings.</p>
		<p>A hoard found in the ruins of Troy II included a gold collar or bracelet of
		twisted rectangular wire with hooked ends, and a similar torque of silver
		wire has come to light in an Early Helladic grave on Levkas. Twisted ornaments
		of exactly the same pattern in bronze, or more often in gold, are common
		during the Middle Bronze Age in the British Isles, As an alternative to
		quadrangular wire, simple or compound ribbon was sometimes twisted thus (Fig. 130). The composite ribbon employed has a X-shaped section and has been made by
		bending a strip of gold ribbon at right angles longitudinally, joining
		two such strips along the keel and then twisting the result. From Great Britain
		these torques were exported to Brittany, Northern France and probably
		Scandinavia.</p>
		<p>In the last-named country in any case a local series, in which the torsion
		effect is generally produced by cast ridges, began in the Late Bronze Age.
		It attained its richest development in that belated Bronze Age that corresponds
		to the Hallstatt period farther south. By then the torsion was often
		not continuous in the same direction, but portions of the ring had been twisted
		in opposite ways (Fig. 137). Finger-rings were made in the same style.</p>
		<p>Another series of British neck ornaments belonging to the Early Bronze Age is		allied in form to the Scandinavian gorgets already described. I refer to
		the so-called lunulae of gold. As their name implies, they are crescent-shaped
		pieces of thin gold plate. The horns are richly decorated with the rectilinear patterns, so characteristic of the Early Bronze Age throughout
		Western Europe, and terminate in flat catches. Over sixty lunulae have been found in Ireland but there are six from Scotland. The
		latter particularly resemble both in plan and ornament the contemporary
		jet necklaces found in the same country. It has therefore been suggested very
		plausibly that the lunulae originated in Scotland as metal copies of
		such necklaces, Ireland being only a secondary centre. Thence in any case they
		were exported to Wales, Cornwall, Brittany, Scandinavia and North
		Germany (Fig. 144).</p>
		<h4>FINGER-RINGS</h4>
		<p class="fst"><img src="fig121-127.jpg" width="405" height="579" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Ornaments, Alsace, Bohemia, Troy, England, Bavaria, Hungary" align="right">One of the simplest conceivable metal ornaments is a ring of wire or ribbon to
		fit on the finger. As bone and stone finger-rings go far back in the
		Stone Age, early metal copies are only to be expected. They are so widespread
		as to have little cultural significance, and only a few specialised
		types need mention here.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Minoans of Crete, copying the Sumerians and Egyptians, used to mark the
		ownership of a packet or authenticate inscribed tablets by the impression
		of a seal. This was at first worn on a string, passing in one class through a
		loop at the back. During Middle Minoan times the loop was enlarged into a
		hoop to fit the finger. The oval seal part (technically called the bezel) with
		its long axis at right angles to the hoop, was of course beautifully
		engraved like the bead or button seals of gems or ivory. No seals nor signet
		rings were made by the European barbarians till late in the Iron Age, but
		in the Late Bronze Age rings of bronze leaf, generally horizontally ribbed,
		were made of bronze ribbon so trimmed as to be much wider at the side worn
		on the back of the finger than on the other. Such rings, common in South-west
		Germany and Switzerland, doubtless imitate Aegean signets.</p>
		<p>A truly European ring, common in Central Europe from the Early Bronze Age
		onwards, was formed of a strand of gold or bronze wire doubled with the ends
		twisted together, coiled into a little cylinder, like the wire bracelets
		already mentioned. During the Middle Bronze Age a very handsome ring of bronze
		ribbon, terminating in opposed spiral disks, characterized the Tumulus culture
		of Western Germany, South-western Bohemia, Austria and Slovakia (Fig. 125). In the Late Bronze Age a more wiry version was in vogue also
		farther east in the urnfields of Moravia and Hungary.</p>
		<p>In Britain we find in hoards of the Middle Bronze Age small coils of massive
		gold with imitation torsion that may have been worn on the fingers but
		possibly served as money.</p>
		<h4>BUTTONS, CLASPS, STUDS AND TUTULI</h4>
		<p><img src="fig128-129.jpg" width="281" height="303" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Tumulus, lock-rings, Hungary" align="right">Even in Early Minoan times, buttons of some perishable material, overlaid
		with gold, were being worn in Crete. The little convex disks of gold leaf,
		that once had sheathed them and now alone survive, are each pierced with two
		thread-holes. Similar hollow button covers, generally of bronze, appear in
		Hungary even in the Early Bronze Age, and in the Middle Bronze Age become very
		plentiful throughout Central Europe. In the Late Bronze Age they were
		gradually replaced by a more solid button, generally flat, with a cast loop on
		the back instead of the thread-holes.</p>
		<p>Buttons of stone, bone and ivory have a longer history. A very famous type,
		common all through Western Europe and right up to Scandinavia and the Tisza
		during the Copper Age, is conical and pierced on the flat side with two holes
		that converge to meet in a V.</p>
		<p>Such buttons with V-perforation in jet or amber remained popular in Britain
		during the Early Bronze Age (Fig. 141).</p>
		<p>
		Studs of stone, shaped like two disks joined by a short cylinder, were used in
		a rudimentary form, perhaps as lip-plugs, in prediluvian Mesopotamia and
		reached Crete even before the local Bronze Age began. A developed variant on
		this in jet was popular in Britain during the Early Bronze Age. Later
		metal studs of the same plan were largely manufactured in Scandinavia.
		</p>
		<p>
		Buckles of jet were employed in Great Britain during the Early Bronze Age. They
		resemble an oval rod with a longitudinal slit.</p>
		<p>For fastening the girdle very handsome clasps were used in Central and North
		Europe during the Middle and Late Bronze Ages. A pretty form, current
		chiefly in Wurrtemberg and on the Upper Rhine, was a hook of doubled wire whose
		ends were coiled in spiral disks. This was replaced in the Late Bronze
		Age by a flat metal plate, circular save for a narrow tang that was bent over
		to form the hook; a loop is attached to the back of the disc at the
		centre. In the Rhone valley during the latest Bronze Age the type was further
		elaborated, the tang growing into a richly decorated oval plate, while
		the original disk, no less ornate, developed three additional hooked tangs.</p>
		<p><img src="fig130-131.jpg" width="297" height="454" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Gold torque, Scotland; Twisted gold armlet, Scotland" align="right">A very distinctive hook was used by Scandinavian warriors of the Middle Bronze
		Age for attaching the scabbard to the girdle. The hook is massive,
		cross-pieces project just below its point and its base is a solid disc.</p>
		<p>The girdles themselves might sometimes be all of sheetmetal. There is an
		example in beaten silver from Byblos in Syria. Magnificently engraved girdles
		of hammered bronze were being manufactured in Upper Italy at the beginning of the Iron Age, and others occur in the contemporary
		Bronze Age of Hungary. But normally the girdles were of leather or wool,
		though often decked with metal ornaments. During the Early Bronze Age of
		Bohemia hammered metal plates were probably thus employed; they are either
		shield-shaped or circular with a hollow dome-shaped boss in the centre. They
		are decorated with engraved triangles arranged in parallel rows or on the
		circumference of concentric circles. Holes near the rim enabled them to be sewn
		on. The latter type persists throughout the Middle Bronze Age,
		spreading to South-west Germany and Scandinavia, to be decorated in each region
		in the appropriate local style.</p>
		<p>Early Bronze Age graves in Lower Bavaria contain extraordinary helical pyramids
		of coiled bronze wire, executed in a technique already exemplified on a
		smaller scale in the jewellery from the earliest Sumerian graves at
		Ur<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#46" name="46b">[46]</a></sup></font> (Fig. 126). Copying the helices by casting produced a metal
		disk with a spike in the centre surrounded by concentric ridges.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#47" name="47b">[47]</a></sup></font> A small
		bent-over tab projects from the edge of the disk for their attach- ment
		to girdles or strings (Fig. 127). This &#8220;spiked tutulus&#8221; is very common
		in the Middle Bronze Age of Hungary and Central Europe. Scandinavian
		women wore a similarly shaped ornament on their girdles, but in the North the
		disk is often very large, 1.1 inches in diameter, and decorated with
		spirals (Fig. 133). In the Late Bronze Age of the North the size is
		still further increased, and the central spike becomes a regular little
		pillar surmounted with a knob. A bar across the base of the hollow pillar
		provides a means of attachment in lieu of the older thread-holes. Quite
		possibly the so-called hanging vases of the latest Bronze Age in Scandinavia are just exaggerations of this type of tutulus (Fig. 135).</p>
		<p>Cones of rolled bronze leaf, or more elaborate versions thereof made by
		casting, were hung like tassels on the ends of woollen girdles.</p>
		<p>Besides stuff and metal plate girdles, double chains were already being worn in
		Bohemia even in the Early Bronze Age. At that date all the links were
		just circular rings. In the Late Bronze Age farther west rings alternate with
		wide links of ribbon.</p>
		<h4>EAR-RINGS AND LOCK-RINGS</h4>
		<p class="fst"><img src="fig132-135.jpg" width="508" height="640" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Bronze collar, Denmark; Bronze tutulus, Denmark; Hanging vase, Denmark" align="right">All European ear-rings and hair-rings of any interest go back in the last
		resort to Mesopotamian types.<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#48" name="48b">[48]</a></sup></font> In the very early Sumerian graves recently
		excavated at Ur of the Chaldees, Woolley found several forms that constitute
		the starting points of our series. The simplest type is a penannular gold
		ring, one end of which has been hammered out till it is boat-shaped while the
		other is sharp. The wide end is sometimes decorated with filigree work,
		at others exaggerated to monstrous proportions and duplicated. Contemporary
		with these undoubted ear-rings are little open spirals, both ends of
		which are boat-shaped (Fig. 129). They were perhaps twisted in the hair
		over the ears and may provisionally be termed lock-rings. Identical
		spiral lock-rings are known from Troy II, the Caucasus, South Russia, Hungary
		and Central Europe. In the latter region a variant grew up in which one
		end is bent back upon itself. There are also wiry copies influenced by the
		contemporary ear-rings.</p>
		<p>The simple ear-ring with one boat-shaped end is also found at Troy and in
		Hungary. At the former site barbaric exaggerations lead to the gigantic
		basket ear-rings. These were made by soldering on to gold bars a series of bent wire
		coils as shown in Fig. 123, the whole being embellished with
		rosettes and pendants. The barbarians of the North, who were ignorant of
		solder, imitated the Trojan type in two ways. In Scotland during the Early
		Bronze Age the basket was formed of a bent sheet of thin gold with a hook projecting from one long side. Such ear-rings have been found as British
		exports in Belgium and Western Poland. In the Early Bronze Age of Hungary and
		Bohemia the gold wire coils that formed components of the Trojan baskets
		were elaborated by themselves to form the ear-ring (Fig. 128). Thence
		they were exported to the still Neolithic inhabitants of Denmark in
		exchange for amber.</p>
		<h4>NECKLACES AND PENDANTS</h4>
		<p class="fst"><img src="fig136-143.jpg" width="460" height="660" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Torques, tutulus, necklaces, beads, buttons" align="right">Perhaps as early as Middle Palaeolithic times men had pierced shells and strung
		them together as necklaces. Upper Palaeolithic man could also carve
		very neat beads out of ivory for the same purpose. The earliest Egyptians we
		know, the Badarians, could already drill stone for beads and soon mastered
		even such hard materials as carnelian and turquoise. An extraordinary variety
		of beads and amulets were carved out of stone or ivory. In prehistoric
		India and Mesopotamia, and later in Crete and the Cyclades too, stone beads
		were soon very popular. Stone beads and amulets based on East Mediterranean
		models and bone copies thereof were then very widely diffused throughout the
		Mediterranean basin and along the Atlantic coasts to Brittany and
		Ireland in the Neolithic and Copper Ages, but had practically gone out of use
		before the local Bronze Age began. Along the Danube valley stone beads
		had never come into vogue at all. Hence in a study of the Bronze Age in North-western and
		Central Europe only amber and jet beads together with a few glazed ones
		imported from the East Mediterranean need be considered.</p>
		<p>Amber necklaces were largely worn in Denmark, Great Britain and Central Europe,
		going back in the first country to early in the New Stone Age. The most
		popular form consisted of two or three strings of almost spherical beads
		connected at intervals by flat spacers. A spacer is a bead perforated with
		several holes, usually parallel, designed to keep the several strings of a
		necklace at the proper distance apart. The English and Scottish jet
		necklaces are similar to the foregoing but often more elaborate. Besides
		sphericals, thin disks, long barrel-shaped beads and flattened barrels with a
		little collar at either end were employed, and the spacers were cut to various
		shapes and diagonally perforated so that the necklace is broader on the
		throat than behind the neck where it was fastened (Fig. 140).</p>
		<p>Even the earliest Egyptians could put a glaze on stone beads, and before the
		beginning of the dynastic epoch they had learned to cast beads of an
		opaque vitreous material termed faience. The secret had also been grasped in
		Mesopotamia and India before the beginning of the fourth millennium.
		Instead of casting a number of separate beads, it was found that the same
		effect could be obtained more cheaply by moulding a tube divided by grooves
		into six or eight segments. Thus arose the so-called segmented bead which may
		have been suggested by the manufacture of simple beads by cutting into
		segments and then breaking off thin tubular bones or the long roots of bovine
		teeth. Segmented beads of faience are in any case known from Assur in Mesopotamia as early as the third millennium BC and appear in Crete during
		MM III and in Egypt under the New Kingdom<font size="-1"><sup class="anote"><a href="#49" name="49b">[49]</a></sup></font>. Analogous
		segmented beads of bluish faience have been found as imports in South- eastern
		Spain, England (Fig. 143) and Poland.</p>
		<p>In Mesopotamia metal pendants as well as beads were hung on necklaces. These
		include gold hoops, bearing wire decorations, and disks engraved and
		inlaid, in both cases provided with a loop for suspension. We find the same
		idea applied in Central Europe chiefly during the Middle and Late Bronze
		Age. A strand of wire, coiled into two spiral disks with a loop between them
		like spectacles, goes back to the Copper Age, and later a small cast
		wheel, possibly a solar symbol, became very popular. Another pendant, very
		common during the Middle Bronze Age in Hungary and adjoining regions as far
		as the Rhine, is heart-shaped. It is actually inspired by Minoan
		collar segments of gold or faience bearing a hybrid pattern, termed by Sir
		Arthur
		Evans the sacral ivy-leaf.</p>
		<p>Naturally, in addition to the foregoing, simpler ornaments such as marine
		shells, Dentalium tubes, bored teeth and tubes of sheetmetal or coiled wire
		were frequently worn.</p>
		<h4>VESSELS</h4>
		<p class ="fst">Where metal was plentiful, it was used for the manufacture of dishes, cups and
		ewers and even pails and cauldrons. The majority were made of
		sheetmetal hammered out. Cups and dishes of precious metals or bronze could be
		made, as they are today, by simply beating up a sheet of metal to the
		desired shape. For larger vessels two or three sheets were shaped by hammering
		and then riveted together. Handles too were generally attached by rivets, but in the case of gold and silver vessels
		they might be soldered on in the Ancrient East and the Aegean. Spouts,
		projecting from the walls of vases in Mesopotamia and Egypt, are said to have
		been brazed on. Parts of the vessel might receive special treatment.
		The rim might be strengthened by hammering over it on either side a ribbon of
		metal. A ring foot can be easily made by inverting the vessel find
		hammering in a circular depression on the base so as to leave a fold all round,
		a process termed cupping the base. The handle is normally a piece of
		ribbon or stout wire with the ends hammered flat to receive the rivets. Metal
		vessels of varied shape are quite common from the beginnings of the
		historical period in Sumer and Egypt, at Troy II, in Copper Age graves north of
		the Caucasus, and in Middle and Late Minoan Crete. North of the Alps
		none are known before the Late Bronze Age with the exception of two gold cups
		from Cornwall.
		</p>
		<p>
		The predynastic Egyptians were very skilled in grinding vases out of even the
		hardest stones, and stone vessels were also freely used in early Sumer,
		in Crete from Early Minoan times and in the Cyclades. This material was not
		adopted for the manufacture of vessels north of the Alps save in Britain.
		And the small group of English cups of shale or amber, belonging mainly to the
		Middle Bronze Age, bear no obvious relation to any East Mediterranean
		form, being equipped with handles and turned on a lathe. Their prototypes are
		to be sought in woodwork.

		<img src="fig144.JPG" width="232" height="232" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Irish gold lunula" align="right">Bronze Age pottery exhibits such a variety of forms and ornaments that it must
		be described in connection with the several cultural groups which it
		serves to define. Technically, it does not differ in any essential principle from Stone Age wares save in the Ancient East and the Aegean. There the
		application of the wheel, already described, gave the potter opportunities for
		all sorts of experiments. In the Aegean too a glaze paint, that is, a paint
		containing silicates that fuse and vitrify during the firing of the vase,
		had been invented in Early Minoan Crete and diffused thence to the Early
		Cycladic and Helladic folk. It enabled the potter to produce lustrous patterns
		without burnishing the whole surface. Apart from these inventions and even
		north of the Alps, Bronze Age pottery exhibits some features, notably
		handles and spouts, apparently unknown or at least very rare in pure Neolithic
		times.</p>
