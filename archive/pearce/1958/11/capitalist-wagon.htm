<h1>&#8216;Tied to the capitalist wagon&#8217;</h1>

<h3>(November 1958)</h3>

<hr class="infotop" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="info">From <strong>The Newsletter</strong>, 22 November 1958.<br />
Transcribed by Christian Hogsbjerg.</p>

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">Perhaps the ablest Marxist historian who still maintains allegiance to the British Communist Party is Eric Hobsbawm.</p>

<p>I recently reread his remarkable article in the <strong>Modern Quarterly</strong> for Autumn 1951 on <em>The Taming of Parliamentary Democracy</em>, and noted his reference to the bureaucrats of the British Labour movement.</p>

<p>It is worth quoting, especially now that Communist Party spokesmen are accusing <strong>The Newsletter</strong> of being caddish and provocative in our treatment of these worthies as a body.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;The imperialist era,&#8217; Hobsbawm wrote, &#8216;has seen the rise of a social group whose function it is to keep the rank and file firmly tied to the capitalist wagon: the body of Labour leaders and officials.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8216;For these the mere creation of a State monopoly capitalism provided new functions, new status, new jobs. With every advance in the strength of the Labour movement, the politeness with which they as individuals are treated, grew.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8216;Whatever the fortunes of the rank and file in the imperialist era, for them it has quite clearly brought an almost unqualified advance.&#8217;<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Locking out and locking up</h4>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;The power of the capitalists to lock out men from the means of life has very marked limitations; given actual working-class solidarity the locking-out would be done by the workers, and the locking up too if need be.&#8217;<br />
&#8211; Tom Mann, August 1910</p>
