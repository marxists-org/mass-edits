<p class="fst">&#8216;Municipal issues are more important today than at any time since the days of Poplarism,&#8217; said somebody in a recent discussion in my ward on the forthcoming local elections. I wonder how many of the under-forties in the movement know what &#8216;Poplarism&#8217; was?</p>

<p>The mass unemployment that followed the short boom after the first world war hit London&#8217;s East End hard. In those days the relief of the unemployed after they had exhausted their insurance rights fell wholly on the borough where they lived.</p>

<p>Poplar, a poor borough, had so many unemployed that the burden on the rates was unbearable.</p>

<p>So in March 1921 the Labour borough council, led by George Lansbury, resolved to withhold the moneys they were supposed to hand over for maintenance of the Metropolitan Police and other all-London purposes.</p>

<p>The London County Council sued Poplar. During the hearing the council held town&#8217;s meetings to explain the position to the people, and organized marches to the court, headed by the borough mace-bearer, with band playing and banners flying.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Thirty councillors arrested</h4>

<p class="fst">In September thirty councillors were arrested, the men being sent to Brixton and the women to Holloway. Large-scale marches to both prisons were organized to demonstrate solidarity.</p>

<p>On one occasion 15,000 people, including many women and children, went to Holloway. In violation of prison rules, Lansbury addressed the crowds from his Brixton cell window.</p>

<p>Back in Poplar a Tenants&#8217; Defence League 10,000 strong pledged refusal to pay rent if their councillors were not released by a certain date.</p>

<p>October saw the release of the Poplar councillors. They marched out singing the &#8216;Red Flag&#8217;. The Ministry of Health and the LCC conferred, and relief burdens were equalized throughout London.</p>

<p>John Wheatley described this as &#8216;a real and substantial surrender to the principles for which Poplar was contending&#8217;, and Lansbury himself said: &#8216;We are very proud of the crime by which we forced rich London to share the burdens of poor London.&#8217;</p>

<p>That was not the end of &#8216;Poplarism&#8217;. In 1922 the Poplar Council were warned by the (Liberal) Minister of Health to desist from paying relief at a scale higher than the miserable officially-approved one, and he actually issued an Order making this illegal.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>A laughing-stock</h4>

<p class="fst">Such was the mood of the workers, however, that this Order remained a dead letter, and a laughing-stock, and in 1924 Wheatley, as Minister of Health in the first Labour Government rescinded it.</p>

<p>J.H. Thomas, the Right-wing trade union leader, called the Poplar councillors &#8216;wastrels&#8217; for the activities that had made their borough a byword for militancy.</p>

<p>Lansbury replied that, while Thomas only talked about the official Labour programme of <em>Work or Maintenance</em>, he and his colleagues had acted to enforce it.</p>

<p>Opportunities of reviving the traditions of &#8216;Poplarism&#8217; will doubtless present themselves to many Labour councillors in the course of the fight against the Rent Act, among other issues that will arise in the coming months.</p>
