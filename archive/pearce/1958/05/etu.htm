<p class="fst">Current talk of industrial action against the H-bomb and the Rent Act, and in particular the Electrical Trades Union&#8217;s welcome decision on the blacking of rocket bases, calls to mind the time when the lights were put out in the Albert Hall.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Armistice of November 1918 which ended the first world war, George Lansbury booked the Albert Hall for a meeting to launch the <strong>Herald</strong> as a daily paper.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Hall authorities cancelled the booking. Lansbury appealed to the Government to intervene against this discrimination, but was told they &#8216;had no power in the matter&#8217;. Then the ETU took a hand.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>The telephone rang</h4>

<p class="fst">The telephone rang at the Albert Hall and the authorities there were curtly informed that unless they kept to their agreement with Lansbury the lights would be cut off.</p>

<p>The following exchange took place:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Is that a threat?&#8217;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;No, it&#8217;s a fact.&#8217;</p>

<p>The fuses were removed, and the local power station manager was told that if he promised not to reconnect it would not be necessary to put the pickets on; otherwise, however, all Kensington would be deprived of light.</p>

<p>Brisk inter-union liaison resulted in the busmen and taxi-men announcing that they would not put down passengers near the Hall, while Underground railwayman undertook not to stop their trains at the stations nearest it.</p>

<p>The Hall authorities were desperate: there were evening concerts arranged, and in a few days&#8217; time the great Victory Ball ...<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>&#8216;Could he possibly ...?&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">They appealed to the Government to help. The Government appealed to George (&#8216;Could Mr Lansbury possibly make it convenient to come to the Board of Trade at once?&#8217;); and his reply was &#8211; &#8216;If we can have the hall, the ETU will, I am sure, restore the light.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Government asked the Hall authorities to change their minds about honouring the <strong>Herald</strong> booking. This was done. The lights went on again.</p>

<p>The <strong>Herald</strong> meeting assembled 12,000 people in the Albert Hall, and thousands more were turned away. Lansbury remarked that the incident had shown &#8216;how dependent all of us are on ordinary workaday people&#8217;.</p>
