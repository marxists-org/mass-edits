<p class="fst">Martell&#8217;s most notorious predecessor in the scab-herding business was William Collison, known in his day as &#8216;the king of blacklegs&#8217;. His cynical memoirs, <strong>The Apostle of Free Labour</strong>, appeared in 1913.</p>

<p>Collison&#8217;s &#8216;Free Labour Association&#8217; was founded in 1893, with money supplied by a body called the Employers&#8217; Parliamentary Council, whose chairman Lord Wemyss later admitted that it was &#8216;an artificial body which we provided with almost all its funds; but we have tried to give it the appearance of independence in order to be able to be able to influence public opinion&#8217;.</p>

<p>The FLA recruited men who were prepared to go anywhere and break strikes, and it was extensively used by the employers in the 1890s and early 1900s in their counter-offensive against the militant &#8216;new unionism&#8217;.</p>

<p>Collison himself was a minor renegade trade union official, inspired by the exploits of the Pinkerton Agency in America. Like Martell, he ran a paper &#8211; the <strong>Free Labour Press</strong>.</p>

<p>Collison&#8217;s scabs went down to South Wales to break a strike of railwaymen on the Taff Vale lines.</p>

<p>The pickets dealt briskly with them &#8211; for instance, they greased the track on inclines so that trains were brought to a standstill through the engine wheels slipping, enabling pickets to uncouple trucks and let them run back to the bottom.</p>

<p>The railway company sued the union for damages and won its case &#8211; the famous &#8216;Taff Vale judgment&#8217; of 1901, the effect of which was to bring into active support of the newly-founded Labour Representation Commitee a number of unions which had not seen till then the need for independent working-class politics.</p>

<p>Martell&#8217;s activities and the clashes which they are provoking will serve in our generation to show up the class issues even more starkly than did Collison&#8217;s.<br />

<h4>The <em>Free Press</em> judgment</h4>

<p class="fst">This column&#8217;s heading in <strong>The Newsletter</strong> of October 25, 1958, was <em>Mr Justice Ron and the Pickets</em>.</p>

<p>It told how a police officer had ruled that two pickets were sufficient for a certain entrance to the Shell-Mex site on South Bank. That, he explained, was how the police &#8216;interpreted&#8217; the law permitting peaceful picketing.</p>

<p>Now a magistrate has upheld this interpretation, in a judgment that should be seen as another &#8216;Taff Vale&#8217;, tending to hamstring the whole trade union movement.</p>
