<p>The
composition of a revolutionary proletarian party in Greece is
impossible without
the struggle against nationalism in general and particularly on the
Macedonian
question. The KKE&rsquo;s <span class="context">[Greek
CP]</span> nationalism not only facilitated its treacherous
policy of
class collaboration - <a href="../../1934pop.htm">"Popular
Front&rdquo;</a>. (The same is true also for the Archive<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">[A]</a></sup>
with its provocative chauvinism on the
Macedonian question and its shy popular frontist policy). It
facilitates its
capitulation to the Dictatorship; <span class="context">[the
Metaxas
dictatorship, since 1936]</span> it will express itself
unavoidably also
during the war, with social-patriotic positions in other fields too,
for example
the national question of the people of Dodecanese, Cyprus. <span class="context">[The Dodecanese islands of mainly Greek
population were
occupied by Italy]</span></p>
<p>We lack here now the
documents on the history of our theory and our policy in the national
question
in general. We note some of it by memory.</p>
<p>The discussions in
the German social-democracy (especially in Austrian Marxism,
<b>Bauer&rsquo;s</b> &ldquo;<i>Nationalities
question</i>&rdquo;, <b>Kautsky</b>&rsquo;s
answer)
was usually about general theory, what is called a nation etc. Bauer
considered
language as a criterion for a nation, Kautsky considered cultural
elements
(Kultur) and common historical experience<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">[B]</a></sup>. Their
common
outcome: peaceful reform within the limits of the accomplished fact of
the
abuses of &ldquo;our&rdquo; national bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>The
theory of bolshevism posed again the question of nationalities of the
Russian
empire on the basis of revolutionary marxism, the way that Marx had
initially
for Ireland. Lenin&rsquo;s discussions with the
&ldquo;Bundists&rdquo; and Rosa on the Polish question brought
to light
his correct positions and our tasks in the age of imperialism and the
world
socialist revolution. Stalin in one of his little brochures supported
opportunistic views, which Lenin attacked as such. We do not keep
unfortunately
the exact elements of that polemic, which besides is of secondary
historical
significance on our subject. The Bundists<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">[C]</a></sup> and all
the
opportunists in the Russian social-democracy supported Austrian-marxist
views
(of shy nationalism and pacifism). This is the first tendency that was
opposed
by the Russian marxists Lenin, Trotsky. Another was the mechanistic
centrist
one, which reduced itself into serving tzarism in the national
question, in the
name of the economic socialist ideal of centrally organised future
economy
(towards that direction attacked the anti-stalinist polemic of Lenin on
the
Georgian national question). The third one correctly combated, was
Rosa&rsquo;s view: There can&rsquo;t be national liberation of
enslaved
nationalities under capitalism, and especially the Polish nationality
in our
age. Therefore we should only launch socialist revolutionary slogans
for them,
and not national ones.</p>
<p>The policy of Bolshevism on the
national question was completed in the 2nd and 3rd Congresses of the
C.I. with
the positions on the colonial question, which is both a national and a
land
question. Our fundamental position on the relevant decisions is well
known. We
give some clarifications that perhaps are not present in
everyone&rsquo;s
memory:</p>
<p>1) Lenin answered Rosa before the war: It is not
foremost correct that achieving national state independence is
impossible for
enslaved nations <b>under capitalism</b> before the
socialist
revolution. For example, as it was, he said, with Norway, etc.
Therefore with
Poland too etc.</p>
<p>2) Of course <b>only</b> with the
socialist revolution will the nationally oppressed find <b>final</b>
and <b>real</b> national freedom. But it is wrong to keep
political
nihilism towards <b>national</b> revolutionary movements
and not to
seek to turn them into assisting allied elements of the general
revolutionary
movement for the overthrow of capitalist power throughout the
world.</p>
<p>3) For the leadership of the national liberation
movement (peasant majority of colonial peoples, backward or non-small
nationalities in Europe) will struggle <b>today</b> the
<b>bourgeoisie</b> and the <b>newly-born
proletariat</b>. The bourgeoisie, even if it initially dominates
(India,
China), even when in the path of national liberation struggle, in the
end, will
come to terms with the oppressors or their rival candidate foreign
oppressors.
For this reason, our policy is: With the entire subjugated people for
self-determination to breakaway - but independent political position
against the
treacherous one of the national-revolutionary purpose of the
bourgeoisie - for
proletarian power which <b>solely</b> is enough guarantee
for
victory against foreign national yoke. Struggle combination to shake
off both
<b>national</b> and <b>social</b> yoke. (Here
Lenin and
Trotsky faced the same opportunistic tendencies of the Indian
right-wing
communist leader Roy in the conferences of the C.I., especially the 2nd
and 3rd
ones).</p>
<p>4) The catastrophic results of Stalinist policy in
China (1925-27, 1936-40) have their main source in stalinist
opportunism in the
national-colonial question: Abandoning the independent position of the
proletariat.</p>
<p>5) The possibility of the recent proletariat of
the oppressed nationality in colonial and backward small nations to
claim the
leadership of the national liberation struggle is based on a) the
general
character of the era, b) the contribution of the metropolitan
progressive
proletariat, the proletariat of the <b>oppressive</b>
nations.</p>
<p>6) The revolutionary proletariat of the oppressive
nation by defending the right of self-determination of the oppressed
nationality
fulfills a <b>vital condition</b> a) for the
internationalist
education of the masses and their complete separation from the
influence of the
ideology of the ruling class, b) for the success of the building of
socialism
tomorrow. An English proletariat that will not demand now the national
liberation of the Irish is not in a position to claim successfully its
own
social liberation from the English capitalist power - said Marx in the
middle of
the last century. Among the exploited masses, proletarians and
peasants, of the
oppressed nationality and the proletariat of the oppressing nation
there exist
feelings of suspicion consequently, nourished systematically by the
ruling
class, of hate and generally of alienation, enmity against their class
siblings.
An element of group psychology that hinders most seriously the unity of
all the
exploited in the struggle against the common national and social enemy,
and, no
two ways about it, will hinder their fraternisation tomorrow for the
construction of socialism. This suspicion and alienation <b>cannot
be
otherwise</b> fought <b>unless</b> the proletariat
and the
peasantry of the oppressed nationality is PERSUADED NOW that the
proletariat of
the oppressing nation is truly, not only in words, <b>in favour
of its
liberation, that now</b>, even WITHIN THE BOURGEOIS REGIME it is
ready to
fight with them for its national liberation <b>even for their
state
breakaway</b>, if they so wish.</p>
<p>Bolshevism has given
this FACTUAL internationalist education since the time of the tzar to
the
numerous oppressed nationalities of the Russian empire, and thus it won
their
trust towards the new dominant order - that is, towards their
confederate,
brotherly and willing co-operation in the task of decentralised
socialist
economic reconstruction. And it is well known that it was this
co-operation that
also gave them the broadest cultural autonomy any bourgeois or
social-democrat
theoritician of the national question could have ever imagined.
Stalinist
absolutism abolishes this precondition today and prepares for new
terrible
splitting explosions in great danger of what has been left from the
conquests of
October (the Ukraine today!).</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>On the
Macedonian question, the various views on the historical and national
question<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">[1]</a></sup>
were generally well put by comrades L.,
T. and Kr. Especially the immediate claims in the end of
comrades&rsquo; L.
and T. recommendations, sum up our views exactly. Their final general
slogans
only are abstract and therefore do not have the substantial
characteristic of
communist slogans, the <b>specific form</b> and <b>immediate
tangibility by the broad masses</b>:</p>
<p>1)
&ldquo;Self-determination of the Macedonian nation even its
breakaway&rdquo; (of the state that is). 2) &ldquo;A Balkan
Federation
of Socialist Soviet Republics&rdquo;. These have to be our general
slogans;
yet it is inaccurate that the Archeiomarxist and KKE positions are
&ldquo;bundist&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Austrian-marxist&rdquo;. These
two parties (the Archive always, the KKE from 1932 and afterwards)
<b>never fought really for even one (1) immediate demand of the
Macedonians. They ignore simply and clearly their existence and say
that the
Greek bourgeoisie has cleared the matter</b> with their double
subjugating
ethnic cleansing in Macedonia, that is, the <b>Greek-Bulgarian</b>
&ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; exchange and the
<b>Greek-Turkish</b> population exchange. They are
therefore
literally parties-agents of Greek nationalism. When did a Stalinist MP
ever
speak for a single, even unimportant immediate matter of the
Macedonians in
Parliament? And among all tragedies that constitute the so-called
&ldquo;Akronafplia fort&rdquo; <span class="context">[where
Pouliopoulos was imprisoned at the time]</span>, the <b>most
tragic</b> one is <b>Macedonians</b> being locked up
in here
as <b>stalinists</b>. We hear that there&rsquo;s also
an
Archeiomarxist of this most tragic kind.</p>
<p>In the critique of
comrades L. and T. to the old KKE slogan (1924-1926) we need to make
clarifications and supplements to avoid mistakes that don&rsquo;t
only have
historical significance: It is correct that the slogan
&ldquo;United and
Independent Macedonia- United and Independent Thrace&rdquo; of the
7th
Balkan Conference and the Special Conference of the KKE in 1924 was
unfounded.
<span class="context">[Pouliopoulos was the KKE G.S.
then]</span></p>
<p>1) There is no such thing as a Thracian
nation. The mixing of Turks and Greeks (the Bulgarians had always been
a very
small minority there) does not put today the national question there in
this
form (a &ldquo;Thracian nation&rdquo;, like in the time of the
Doriean
descent <span class="context">[One of the Greek tribes,
arriving from
the north 3000 years ago. They&nbsp;founded the city-state of
Sparta. Thrace was inhabited by other
nations at the time of the Doriean descent, who did not speak the Greek
language]</span> - this is obvious.</p>
<p>2) Similarly, this
slogan turns the Macedonian question in to a <b>territorial</b>
one,
and not the national question it is. Geographically, Macedonia is a
territory
which justifiably creates confusion among the Bulgarian nationalist
&ldquo;autonomists&rdquo; and those demanding the freedom of
the
Macedonian nation. This nation is concrete in a certain only part of
the
geographical entity which is called &ldquo;Macedonia&rdquo;. Of
course
(and here the analysis of the recommendation of comrades L.- T. is most
satisfactory) revolutionary policy does not regard the whole thing
statistically-territorially, as the ethnologist and
&ldquo;socialist&rdquo; lapdogs of the Balkan bourgeoisies do,
but
dynamically-<b>revolutionary</b>, and leaves after the
revolution
the definition of free national territories to the <b>really</b>
free will of the interested parties in brotherhood. But the confusion
that the
bad formulation of our slogans inflicts upon the masses of the
oppressing and
the oppressed nations, can <b>hinder</b> instead of
helping the
purposes of our internationalist policy. And it has indeed helped them:
without
what amazing ease did the Greek proletarians accept the new
<b>super-chauvinistic</b> policy of the KKE which succeeded
that
erroneous slogan! What a terrible chaos was created inside the heads of
all
fighters and how this hinders and will hinder their internationalist
education
by our Party!</p>
<p>But the error of those slogans is not Thrace
(which as an unimportant matter it was, it had been missing from all
KKE
documents, even those of the 1st of December 1924- so irresistible was
the power
of reality!) nor the &ldquo;unfounded&rdquo; reality of the
formulation
of the Macedonian slogan. Those slogans were <b>true opportunism
and of
the most original adventurist type</b>. For those who are
unfamiliar with
the analyses of the first left opposition group of the KKE <span class="context">[meaning the Pouliopoulos&rsquo;
&ldquo;New
Beginning&rdquo; group, still members of the KKE in 1927]</span>
and
later those of &ldquo;Spartakos&rdquo; <span class="context">[Pouliopoulos&rsquo;
theoretical organ after his
group&rsquo;s expulsion from the KKE]</span> on this most
important of
questions, some will be added here.</p>
<p>After the first (1923)
and second (1924) Bulgarian defeats, and after the great German defeat
of 1923
(autumn), the Stalinist bureaucracy then starting to stabilise and
seriously
undermine the International [the Zinoviev-Stalin adventurism period
(1924-26)]
centered its European policy around national revolutions (Radic,
Slovenians,
Czechs, Ukrainians, Macedonians etc). Spokesman Manuilsky, in the 5th
congress
(1924) said: The bomb we&rsquo;re putting for the success of the
European
revolution is now: the national revolutions. The central question
overshadowing
all others in the 5th world congress was the national one. Then the KKE
was also
obliged to place the Macedonian question in the centre of its policy
because -as
Dimitrov and Kollarov announced in Moscow- <em>&ldquo;only
thus will
we defeat the Bulgarian guerillas, in alliance with us for the conquest
of power
in Bulgaria. The KKE must be prepared to make any sacrifice for the
Bulgarian
revolution, that is, the Balkan revolution&rdquo;</em>. After
the
opportunist leaders of the Bulgarian CP blighted the movement, they
fell to
adventurist self-deceit when they believed that, since with the force
of the
proletariat and the peasants they could not conquer power, they would
do so with
the contract of political alliance that they signed in May 1924 in
Vienna with
Alexandrov and Protogerov<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">[D]</a></sup>. Within 6 months only,
that shadowy
alliance collapsed to reveal the extent of blindness of the Bulgarian
party
-stalinist under construction- leadership of Kollarov-Dimitrov.
Alexandrov was
murdered, and then Protogerov, and the Macedonian guerillas, after
playing once
again their bloody role against the communist workers and peasants of
Bulgaria
(slaughter after the Sveta-Nedelia<sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">[E]</a></sup> putsch,
April
1925), fell in turn victims of the &ldquo;eternal
friendship&rdquo; of
the Serbian and Bulgarian bourgeoisies. The Macedonian movement as a
distinct
revolutionary organisation, was made illegal in Bulgaria
too.</p>
<p>According to the logic of that political opportunism
towards the Macedonian revolutionary committee, our slogan should not
explicitly
express our position of principle, but should demand an independent
Macedonia
(and Thrace). This why, when the extremist-Zinovievist phase of the
rising
Stalinist bureaucracy was followed by the opportunist-Bukharinist one
after the
final ruin of the Balkan movement, <b>Batulescu</b>,
representative
of the International, was sent to Greece to say suddenly
&ldquo;withdraw the
slogan&rdquo; when the C.C. of the Party had to defend publicly in
court
<span class="context">[Pouliopoulos, among others, as the
Party&rsquo;s G.S.]</span> the matter of proletarian
internationalism
and the Party&rsquo;s honour. And the C.C. with its position saved
the
honour of the struggling proletariat and the KKE<sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">[F]</a></sup>,
sending to hell
that ludicrous apparitor of Stalin, but Manuilsy&rsquo;s
&ldquo;bomb&rdquo; had been proven to be a bomb not in the
foundations
of European capitalism, but of European communism. Indeed, within one
year, the
entire fiery literature of 1924 on the national question had been
transferred to
the sorrowful archives of the stalinised International.</p>
<p>In
the 3rd congress of the KKE (March 1927) the Stalinist representative
of the
C.I. <b>Remmele</b> (after defeating Trotskyism and the
first
opposition group of the KKE with slander, ended up in the concentration
camps of
Turkestan and finally, the firing squad) essentially withdrew the
slogan.
Typically though, he endorsed it against our opposition for reasons of
internal
prestige of the bureaucracy, taking advantage of the general faith of
the Party
in Lenin&rsquo;s International and the Party&rsquo;s ignorance
of the
left opposition movement, only then emerging out of the Russian
borders.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>1. Whoever refutes the
existence, unresolved until today, of a <b>national Macedonian
question</b> in Greek, Bulgarian, Serbian Macedonia, is <b>without
a
doubt</b> a lapdog of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>2. Whoever
refutes the historical liberation movement of the Macedonians, is
either
ignorant and must learn the history of that movement and its national
heroes, or
is again a lapdog of one of the three oppressing
bourgeoisies.</p>
<p>3. This movement until now has been drowned in
blood and treason, or has suffered a ruinous for the interests of the
Macedonian
workers and peasants, exploitation by the (Bulgarian especially) Balkan
bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>4. This movement can find again a new
development under new favourable historic conditions - social, economic
(ruthless exploitation of the working Macedonian masses by the
conquering
national bourgeoisies, land questions, etc), political (internal crises
in the
Balkan states, war) and cultural conditions.</p>
<p>5. Whoever
refutes this possibility is blind or turns a blind eye, if
he&rsquo;s not a
lapdog of the nationalist subjugators of the much-afflicted Macedonian
people.</p>
<p>6. Communists do not undertake to
&ldquo;create&rdquo; national movements where they do not exist
in the
first place, a chimerical task. They support such movements where they
exist.</p>
<p>7. Communists, faced with a beaten down or betrayed
national liberation movement or with ethnic cleansing and subjugating
acts of
their national bourgeoisie don&rsquo;t close their eyes and
don&rsquo;t
become worshippers of the &ldquo;done deed&rdquo;. They will
not deny
the reality of the national oppression of a nation and its
<b>desire</b> (in the heart and mind of every Macedonian
worker) to
shake off the national yoke one day. Communists make these liberating
desires of
the Macedonian people their own, and declare loudly from now its right
for
self-determination, even breakaway, if they so wish. They defend daily
every
immediate national demand, economic, political, cultural, and thus they
prepare
now tomorrow&rsquo;s revolutionary alliance of the social
revolutionary
movement of the proletariat with the national revolutionary movement of
the
Macedonians against the common enemy: the Balkan bourgeoisie.</p>

<p><a href="#2b" name="2">[B]</a>Pouliopoulos
here, obviously
writing from memory, reverses their respective positions: In his
complex theory,
Otto Bauer suggests as a definition: <em>&ldquo;A nation is
the sum of
people connected by a commonness of destiny, through a commonness of
character&rdquo;</em>. In this framework - which here we only
present
schematically -, he considers common language as <em>&ldquo;the
means
by which common culture acts, the tool by which cultural commonness was
created
and preserved, as an external regulation of the form of social
co-operation of
the individuals that make up a community and which they propagate
unremittingly&rdquo;</em>, even if one must take into
consideration
that <em>&ldquo;language is not only the means of
transmitting
cultural goods, but is of its own a cultural one&rdquo;</em>
(Otto
Bauer <em>&ldquo;The question of nationalities and
social-demoracy&rdquo;</em>). It is in that point where one
of Karl
Kautsky&rsquo;s criticisms is centered: <em>&ldquo;We do
not
understand why Bauer refuses to recognise the link, or more precisely
the
strongest of links that hold together the nation&rsquo;s unity and
which is
obvious: Language. (...) The powerful role of language in social life
can help
us understand to a great part the power of national sentiment. On the
contrary,
commonness of national character, which no one knows well what looks
like and
which in practice does not affect perceptibly our collective life, it
does not
explain anything (...) It is only by taking into account the
significance of
language for the state that we can understand fully the power of rule
of
nationalities in modern politics&rdquo;</em> (Karl Kautsky
<em>&ldquo;Nationality and Internationality&rdquo;</em>
article of criticism to Bauer). [D. Platanos] </p>
<p><a href="#3b" name="3">[C]</a> <em>Bundists</em>
(Bund: General Jewish Workers&rsquo; Union of Russia, Lithuania and
Poland):
A workers&rsquo; organisation of social-democracy, which professed
the
cultural peculiarities with which it justified the separate
organisation of
workers of different nationalities. The bundists found a theoretical
stand in
Austrian-marxism (Karl Renner and, mainly, Otto Bauer), who - wanting
to answer
the problems which principally Austria-Hungary posed - elaborated a
theory on
the national question, revolving around cultural elements and
concluding in
adopting cultural autonomy for the nationalities within the limits of a
unified
state, independent of territorial borders. [D. Platanos]
</p><p><a href="#5b" name="5">[D]</a>
Todor Alexandrov and Aleksandar Protogerov: After the Neigy treaty
27/11/1919 they reconstructed
the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation (VMRO) for the
defence of the
Bulgarian minority in Macedonia. Next, demanding autonomy of the Greek
and
Serbian Macedonia as a transitional stage for their annexation by
Bulgaria. In
1921, with the help of the military, they made a coup d&rsquo;
etat, killing
Aleksandar Stabolinsky, the leader of the agrarian party, and Yurukov,
founder of the
&ldquo;Macedonian Federalist Organisation&rdquo;. They
supported the
dictatorship of Tsankov, and along with the military they drowned in
blood the
workers and peasants revolution of the 12th of September 1923. In 1924,
after
disagreeing with government policy, Alexandrov signed a treaty with the
3rd
International as a representative of the internal MRO that he would
co-operate
with the Bulgarian CP to topple the capitalist government. Since this
agreement
left no impression to the other guerillas, he was forced to withdraw
his
signature from the treaty, and was soon assassinated. [D.
Platanos, first names and correction by Zdravko].</p>
<p>The Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO) is
the most
important national liberation organization of the Slavic population in
Macedonia against the Turks established in 1893. The Macedonian
historiography
insists that the VMRO's leaders had ethnic Macedonian feelings, but
according
to the historical documents it is clear that they have ethnic Bulgarian
feelings (but don't make the implication: if they had ethnic Bulgarian
feelings
than the slavic population had that feeling too). After the World War
1,
Alexandrov and Protogerov reestablished the VMRO as clear right-wing
organization (the original VMRO wasn't right-wing and had a lot of
left-wingers
in it). Because the Macedonian population was inclinating a lot towards
the VMRO
(one of the reasons being the influental force of this name), the
Comintern
wanted to establish a VMRO organization under its influence. It wanted
to unite
all pro-Macedonian revolutionaries, Alexanrov's VMRO too, but
Alexandrov (after
strong reaction of the Bulgarian establishment and other leading VMRO
members)
has rejected the idea. So, the Comintern sponsored organization was
established
without the right wing of the Macedonian revolutionaries, as VMRO
(united). [Zdravko]
</p><p><a href="#6b" name="6">[E]</a>
The
Bulgarian CP, on Easter Day, blew up a church
were they believed that top members of the Tsankov government would be.
The coup
failed and a brutal attack and massacres were launched against peasant
and
worker followers of the CP. [D. Platanos] </p>
<p><a href="#7b" name="7">[F]</a> In
the 24th of August, 1925, P.
Pouliopoulos, with 23 others, was taken to court accused on attempting
to
&ldquo;rend Macedonia and Thrace&rdquo;. His amazing 5-hour
long defence
is historical. The trial was adjourned. In the 22nd of February 1926,
the trial
of the so-called &ldquo;autonomists&rdquo; continued. The court
ceased
both trial and prosecution, but instead of letting them go, they were
led to
exile in Anafis, Amorgos and Folegandros. [D. Platanos]
