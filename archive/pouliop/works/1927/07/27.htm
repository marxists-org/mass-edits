<p><em>To the KKE leadership [Greek CP trans.]  </em></p>

<p>Comrades,  </p>

<p>The published decisions of the Plenary session of the Central
Committee make official one of the most dangerous situations that
the Party has known until today. No comrade in the Party, having
a shred of communist honesty, can take the responsibilities, which
the passive approval of the current situation would bring upon
them. Everyone knows that the current C.C. doesn&#8217;t represent the
true convictions of the Party. It&#8217;s the result of a disastrous,
erroneous application of international super-centralism and a
stupidly biased compromise made in the 3rd conference (blank voting
with a protest of 15 conventioneers). Objectively, the ruling
organ of the Party today, is an expression of a broader political
rigging. Essentially, the Party is ruled by a clique whose entire
history in the Party is one of political adventurism. It took
advantage of the original political apathy of some members of
the C.C. (a supposed &#8220;marxist&#8221; group) and the political
naivety of some others (a supposed &#8220;workers&#8221; group),
and thus took over the Party mechanism and uses it unchecked for
its own destructive factionalist purposes. One of those &#8220;groups&#8221;,
consistent to their classical political apathy, could not do anything
more than quit, without having the courage and honesty though
to explain clearly their reasons of resigning, and thus enlighten
the Party. They later withdrew their resignations, with the false
statement that supposedly the opposition hinders them, with their
dissolving activity to fight (!!) against political adventurism,
with whom however they identified completely in practice, taking
upon them all blame for that adventurism&#8217;s criminal activity against
the Party. And this group, wavering they resigned again later
in the Plenary session from the responsible positions of the leadership
organ. Thus, typically as well, the Party is in a permanent leadership
crisis, even before the opposition declares itself. The adventurism
of the leading clique within three months after the 3rd conference
has led the Party to an unprecedented sharpening of the disintegrating
phenomena, into real disasters and ridicule (organisational disorder,
the tobacco workers affair <sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">[B]</a></sup>, public appearances, etc). The Plenary
session of the C.C. converged not to deal with the serious problems,
that the internal disorderly situation puts in front of the Party,
the international and national situation, neither to draw practical
conclusions from the adventurism of the Political Bureau, but
converged instead only to cover up these under the dissolutionism
scarecrow. The content of the decisions of the Plenary session,
which almost completely ignored an event of such enormous significance
for the history of the workers&#8217; movement like the tobacco workers
struggle, is a phenomenon of ultimate political shamelessness!
 </p>

<p>As a genuine vehicle and decisive expressive medium of the
indignation of all thinking comrades against the disintegrating
factionalism of the leading adventurist clique, rose within the
Party the opposition. It declared clearly and honestly its vies
in front of the 3rd conference, written and orally, and with bolshevik
firmness supported them by discussing them with the delegation
of the Communist International and proving tangibly that they
ignore persons and happenings in the KKE and that they erroneously
and contrary to the teachings of Lenin and revolutionary experience
they apply the organisational principles of the C. In.  </p>

<p>You have drowned the voice of the opposition, you did not publish
its declarations officially recorded in the 3rd conference, with
the malicious aim to hide them from the Party and so not to be
able to compare them with its critical political thinking against
the its current political experience, evaluating their correctness
or erroneousness. You published views and articles of comrades
of the opposition as official views of the Party without their
signatures, so that the Party wouldn&#8217;t know that our political
line is outright communist and correct. (&#8220;Rizospastis&#8221; <sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">[C]</a></sup>, 14/4 &#8220;Against the rent of landlords&#8221;, 15/4, full positions of the KKE with the same title, 5/6, &#8220;What is the Insurance Fund&#8221;, 26/6, &#8220;The struggle concerning T.A.P.K&#8221;, 26/6, &#8220;Constitution and Communism&#8221;, 30/7, &#8220;The significance of the sailors movement&#8221;). You
didn&#8217;t publish our refuting declarations about the bogus slander
of the bourgeois press on our &#8220;secession&#8221;, in order
to profit from it and sharpen your factional weapon of the supposed
truth of the opposition&#8217;s &#8220;movement towards a split&#8221;!
You don&#8217;t discuss within the Party like honest revolutionaries
the correctness or erroneousness of our views on the basic problems
of the movement, but instead you defame, lie, blacken and terrorise
the uneducated workers of the Party -it is you who leave them
uneducated, for them to be easy prey of your demagoguery- with
the spectre of our &#8220;dissolutionism&#8221;. You talk about
&#8220;obstacles&#8221; that we presumably raised in the dissolution
of the &#8220;Third Situation&#8221;, when we only struggled to
persuade every honest revolutionary belonging to the &#8220;Third
Situation&#8221;<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">[D]</a></sup>  to enter the Party, while you refuse to accept
them, for fear of reinforcing the opposition, and thus pushed
them towards regenerating their organisation. No one among you
believes that we want to split the Party, nor that we &#8220;fatally
bear with it&#8221;. If there is anyone among you who believes
that, he&#8217;s a political infant. Our dedicated Party work after
the Conference proves that we struggle to make the only Party
! of the Greek proletariat healthier, not to dissolve it. What
we seek to dissolve once and for all is the adventurism leading
the Party to disintegration or to its current level stagnation.
You have declared the opposition effectively &#8220;out of order&#8221;,
you tie our hands <sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1</a></sup>, you remove every means to communicate with the Party and you prohibit us from shaking off the heavy accusation that we want to dissolve the Party. It is now crystal clear that you are the pettiest factionalists that the international communist
movement has ever known. Without daring yet to &#8220;expel&#8221;
the opposition, you expel form the Party nuclei and branches (Athens
Organisation, Athens Youth), workers, trade union secretaries
(Athenian Waiters), for simply requesting to enlighten them on
what the opposition says. You are calling us archeiomarxists <sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">[E]</a></sup> and under your sneers, gangs of &#8220;selected&#8221; members of the Athens Organisation, unpunished by the Party, attack like thugs comrades of the opposition, whose only crime is their years in prison, persecution and exile for the Revolution. You have
turned the Party into an army camp, where military discipline
has substituted workers&#8217; democracy, and the simple worker trembles
in front of the corporal-local commissar reprimanding him for
reading the &#8220;New Beginning&#8221;!! You don&#8217;t have dissolving
theories, you are practically dissolving the Party.  </p>

<p>Comrades, even a little working class child understands that
there is only one means for the ideological struggle to proceed
normally inside our Party, and to become truly constructive and
raising its own level: the immediate democratisation of centralism,
ceasing terror inside the party and that stupid &#8220;dissolutionism&#8221;
firework, calling an Extraordinary Conference and free comradely
discussion in &#8220;Rizospastis&#8221;, as well as freedom of speech
for the opposition in every nucleus of the Party and the Youth
organisations.  </p>

<p>In our view, the problems to be discussed are:</p>

<dl><dd>
<ol type="I">
<li>Organisational
<ol>
<li> The crisis in the Party</li>
<li>The problem of qualitative composition and its leninist position on the Greek communist movement</li>    
<li>Internal normalisation of the Party and democratic centralism</li>
<li>Theoretical-educative and practical work and their correct correlation for the KKE</li>    
<li>&#8220;Archive of Marxism&#8221;, &#8220;Third Situation&#8221;</li>
</ol></li>

<li> Political   

<ol>
<li>Political pseudorevolutionary adventurism, particular instances and how to fight it off</li>
<li>National Question</li>
<li>Theory of &#8220;Socialism in one country&#8221; and international opposition</li>  
<li>Danger of war, struggle for the legality and practical preparation of forms of illegal organisation and illegal work</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Professional
<ol>
<li>The problem of unity</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</dd></dl>

<p>If you have conviction in your own views, why are you afraid
to let the whole of the Party and its followers hear our views
too? If our &#8220;theories&#8221; truly dissolve the Party, as
you say, then it won&#8217;t be difficult at all to persuade the Party
on this. It is a demagogical lie that discussion today is &#8220;unadvisable&#8221;
because of &#8220;dangerous conditions&#8221;. In this sense, conditions
for a communist party will never cease to be &#8220;dangerous&#8221;.
No matter how dangerous the political conditions are, there is
nothing more dangerous for Greek communism than the current internal
situation of the KKE. The more dangerous this situation is, the
more urgent the need to recognise these dangers, to think collectively,
the whole of the Party, not factionistically of the best ways
to deal with them. Comrades don&#8217;t forget that in the first instance
of illegality the party the Party almost dissolved in essence,
and during the Asia Minor war <sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">[F]</a></sup>   the Party was talking idly about the 21 clauses while most &#8220;pure communists&#8221; where common deserters, that is practically anarchists. And  don&#8217;t forget that basically since then we only changed the name of the Party, our attitude remains the same. About what illegality and what confrontation with the new war are you on about, what assistance to the international revolution, with today&#8217;s organisational condition and with the theoretical and political confusionism that prevails among us? Where are you going?  </p>

<p>The Party leadership in reality remains completely unconscious
in the face of the above dangers and recalls them only to obscure
the Party spirit. They play a very sad game against it. They say
that the opposition with their ideas seek to dissolve the Party
and turn it into a &#8220;reactionary petit-bourgeois&#8221; organisation,
that is a fascist organisation reacting to even the most elementary
demands of the working class (for no other reactionary petit-bourgeois
organisation can today be meant outside fascism). They also know
that the opposition stated in the 3rd conference and now declares
that they consider the struggle within the Party a vital need
for the dominance of these &#8220;reactionary&#8221; views. If the
leadership truly believed what they say inside the Party about
the opposition, and if they had any elements of political consistency
and honesty, they ought in accordance to rid the Party organisation
immediately of such dangerous members who have ordered from their
tailors their greek fascist black shirts! But they don&#8217;t dare
do that. They merely &#8220;rid them of responsible positions&#8221;.
This shows that the Leadership has lost every sense of political
soberness. On the other hand they declare officially that &#8220;it
is not an opposition but rather a reaction within the Party&#8221;
(statements of the General Secretary of the Party to the Council
of Secretaries in Peraeus), that we are the &#8220;internal enemies
of the Party&#8221; (&#8220;Youth&#8221; 15/7), that we &#8220;stick
a murderous knife to the back of the Party&#8221; (&#8220;Rizospastis&#8221;
30/7), while in reality we continue being members of the Party,
working for the Party purposes and under the commands of its responsible
organs.  </p>

<p>This game that you&#8217;re playing, comrades, is a stupid political
farce. A farce against the Party, a farce against the revolutionary
proletariat who needs a Party able to instill respect by everyone,
&#8220;even its enemies&#8221; (Lenin), and not laughter.  </p>

<p>We declare that we don&#8217;t mean under any circumstances to become
comedians of this farce alongside you, because we happen to have
a completely different notion of our position among the lines
of fighting revolutionaries of our country.  We plead you for
the last time to cease your squalid fractionistic methods, to
recognise charter rights to the opposition, to allow us to tell
the whole Party our views, opening a free discussion in &#8220;Rizospastis&#8221; and the organisations. Otherwise we inform you that we&#8217;ll find the appropriate way to enlighten the Party.  </p>

<p>With revolutionary greetings  </p>

<br>
I declare that I agree absolutely with the above<br>
declaration of comrade Pouliopoulos  <br>
<br>
P. Giatsopoulos  
<br>
<br>
Athens, 27th July 1927<br>   </p>

<hr class="base">

<p><a href="#1b" name="1">1</a> Before this declaration was delivered to the Political Bureau, it had been read to a conference of the nuclei of the
Peraeus Organisation with the following addition: &#8220;You don&#8217;t
publish the statements of the opposing members of the C.C. of
the Party&#8221;. The P.B. was forced to publish the next day these
statements in &#8220;Rizospastis&#8221;.  </p>

<p>Translator&#8217;s notes:  </p>

<p><a href="#2b" name="2">[A]</a> First published in 1927 in the special paper &#8220;Neo Ksekinima&#8221; (New Beginning), &#8220;special paper of the opposition inside the KKE&#8221;, republished in December 1986 by Outopia
Publications, Athens in &#8220;Spartakos, texts 1930-1932&#8221;.

Referring to the tobacco workers strike in June 1927 in
Peraeus.  </p>

<p><a href="#4b" name="4">[C]</a> &#8220;Rizospastis&#8221; (Radical in English) is the organ
of the Greek Communist Party, still in circulation to this day.
 </p>

<p><a href="#5b" name="5">[D]</a> In the words of Pouliopoulos (&#8220;Letter to the members
of the KKE&#8221;): &#8220;The so-called &#8220;Third Situation&#8221;
includes proletarian and intellectual elements with good communist
propaganda work in the past, who request to enter the Party. The
tactic of the Party Leadership towards them is basically erroneous.
They demand from them not to have certain views on the recovery
of the Party, but to declare that they recognise absolutely the
correctness of the decisions of the 3rd Conference, while the
only thing that the leadership could ask from the revolutionary
proletarian followers of the International would be to declare
discipline to the Party&#8221;.  </p>

<p><a href="#6b" name="6">[E]</a> The archeiomarxists (named after their organ &#8220;Archive
of Marxism&#8221;) were another group of opposition to the KKE
(external) led by Witte (Giotopoulos). They became the Greek section
of the ILO, a decision bitterly opposed by Pouliopoulos and his
group. They eventually split with Trotsky and the F.I. in 1933
and faded to obscurity.  </p>

<p><a href="#7b" name="7">[F]</a> That is the Greek-Turkish war of 1919-1922, where Pouliopoulos
himself was sent in 1920, and where he began his political activity
by joining the KKE, then called SEKE. </p>
