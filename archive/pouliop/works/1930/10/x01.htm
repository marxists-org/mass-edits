<p>Thirteen years of constant existence of Soviet power in the midst of
a capitalist world, whose pedestal is shaking by constant social
turmoil, have made obvious the absurdity, which after November 1917 the
politicians and theoreticians of international reaction have
counterpoised to the magnificent realisation of the Russian
proletarians: That this revolution was not historically necessary.
Regardless of the progressive leaps of the new socialist civilization
that the revolution has achieved during these last thirteen years and
regardless of the future fate of this undertaking in Russia, the
October Revolution was a historical necessity of its time.</p>

<p>It is the grandest epoch-making event in mankind&#8217;s development,
since the existence of class society in the world, and gave and still
gives the greatest lesson of our century to the conscious moving force
of the future progress of mankind, to the international proletariat.</p>

<p>Such is the nature of reactionary philosophy, that it cannot hold
dialectic truth, that the Russian proletarian revolution as a necessary
event, is also rational; that is, it is not due to the &#8220;manic&#8221;
agitation of a handful of revolutionaries, nor to the Kaiser&#8217;s marks
and the intrigues of the German General Staff, as the bankrupt of the
February Revolution, Kerensky, shamelessly declared in his recent
memoirs.</p>
<p>The logical roots of the October revolution were revealed to us with
admirable scientific accuracy validated by experience, by its
theoretician and political leader, N. Lenin.</p>

<p>The dissolution of the bourgeois state organisation in tzarist
Russia and the historical weakness of the Russian bourgeoisie to
complete the tasks of the bourgeois democratic revolution after the
wreckage of tzarism &#8212; a weakness that unavoidably brought it to the camp
of counter-revolution &#8212; was synchronised with the period of
revolutionary crisis of international capitalism, initiated by the
great imperialist war, that brought the working class as a protagonist
in the scene of world history. The Russian proletariat inside such a
complex of historical conditions, was the natural and logical concluder
of the bourgeois democratic revolution in Russia and the initiator of
the international social revolution in its country. The opening of the
revolutionary period was lit in the foreground of post war history not
only by the Moscow barricades, but of those of Hamburg and Bavaria and
Hungary and Italy and the Baltic States and Saxony and Bulgaria in &#8217;23
and the colonial insurrections in the East and North Africa. The
transitional age we&#8217;re living in since 1914, is a period of imperialist
wars, social revolutions and national insurrections. In the chain of
events that we&#8217;ll live until capitalist power is at its last gasp
throughout the world, the Russian Revolution of 1917 is the first link.
The existence of a large Marxist party, steeled by the revolutionary
experience of twenty five years, the existence of a genius leader&#8217;s
staff, the delayed development of the local bourgeoisie and the long
dominance of the basic economical arteries of the country on foreign
finance capital that was giving in significant scale to the
anticapitalist proletarian struggle a national revolutionary character,
those factors combined with the classic betrayal of the revolution by
the parties of the petit-bourgeois democracy (Social-Revolutionaries
and Mensheviks), gave victory to the Russian proletariat, as opposed to
the temporary defeats that the proletarian revolution suffered in other
countries.</p>
<p>There is no more characteristic sign for the various political
tendencies and parties today than the position they take towards the
Russian Revolution of 1917. From this viewpoint, the international
social-democracy revealed its total separation from Marxism and any
revolutionary tradition of the workers&#8217;movement, and ended up a mere
radical complement of the reactionary critique that doubted even the
historic necessity of a revolutionary transition in Russia. All the
wisdom of official social-democracy, in relation to the question of the
Russian Revolution, is summed up today in the following: &#8220;The Russian
Revolution should not have proceeded in socialist tasks, but should
finish only the bourgeois democratic transition of the country. A
proletarian revolution never occurred in Russia. The Soviets must be
substituted with a bourgeois democracy.&#8221; But if someone observes the
development of the viewpoint of today&#8217;s social-democratic
theoreticians, from the first years of our century up to now regarding
the Russian question, will be truly astonished in front of the
greatness of their tragicomic palinode. In 1902, Karl Kautsky, the most
powerful mind of the Marxism in the International, making <sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">[1]</a></sup>
a historic parallel of the revolutions of the previous century with the
gigantic workers&#8217;insurrections that the 20th century forewarned even
at its threshold, was establishing the moving of the centre of the
International Revolution to Russia, as opposed to Western Europe,
becoming &#8220;the fortress of reaction and authoritarianism".<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">[2]</a></sup>
In 1908, when Leon Davidovich Trotsky formulated in Kautsky&#8217;s
theoretical organ <em>Neue Zeit</em>, in a magnificent theoretical vehicle,
the potential of the International proletarian revolution whose
prologue began since 1905 in Russia (theory of the &#8220;permanent
revolution"), pointing out that &#8220;under the force of historical
necessity, the Russian revolution overthrowing the narrow limit&#8217;s of
bourgeois democracy, would force the proletariat after its triumph to
break also the framework of nationality, that is, to guide consciously
its efforts in such a way for the Russian revolution to become the
prologue of the international revolution";<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">[3]</a></sup> when he formulated these, he found in further agreement not only Franz Mehring and Rosa Luxembourg, but also Kautsky and his followers. In 1917 and &#8217;18, Otto Bauer, the most clever and &#8220;most left&#8221;leader of modern social-democracy, saluted the Russian proletarian revolution and justified Bolshevik tactics (naturally to limit the admittance of its correctness only within the particular conditions of authoritarian
Russia).<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Ever since the experience of bloody struggles in Western Europe,
America, Japan and the colonies came to verify plangently the
conclusion of the Russian Marxists that if &#8220;finally it is advantageous
for the proletariat to conduct its own class struggle, and even its
dictatorship, within the framework of democratic institutions without
this meaning that history always offers the proletariat the possibility
of such a combination&#8221;,<sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">[5]</a></sup> the increasing bankruptcy of bourgeois parliamentarism, and the day-by-day fascistisation of bourgeois democracies prove incontrovertibly the international value of the Bolshevik tactics and the new type of state that the Russian experience gave us. This state having as its basic cell the council of representatives of the workers on the place of
production on one hand surpasses the oppressive bureaucratic and
pseudorepresentative forms of bourgeois democracy with the corruption
of its officialdom and with the separation of the legislative,
executive and judicial functions and on the other hand increasingly
raises the last worker and peasant, &#8220;the last cook&#8221;to use Lenin&#8217;s phrase, to the role of active vehicle of all the state functions
together, that is, it ensures the highest grade of democratic
participation of citizens in directing the common affairs.</p>

<p>And since then, for social-democracy, what a tragic irony! Until
1921 the Georgian social-democrats were pushing forward the betrayal of
the socialist banner up to the point of organising a mercenary
counter-revolution to &#8220;liberate&#8221;their country from the &#8220;yoke&#8221; of the first proletarian democracy and surrendering its wealth-producing sources to the exploitation of English imperialists. In 1921 Kautsky salutes the end of war communism and the beginning of the NEP, not as
the beginning of a systematic and gradual socialistisation of the
country, on the basis of economic set-up, that the ruined, through
strife of the civil war, Russian capitalism bequeathed to the Russian
proletariat, but as a cleaning up of the proletarian revolution and
progress of Russia to &#8220;correct bourgeois democratic institutions&#8221;. Even today Kautsky himself, who twenty five years ago foretold the erasure
of bourgeois influence within social-democracy, thanks to the
contribution of the Russian revolution, in his last book evangelises,
alongside Chamberlain, open counter-revolution against the &#8220;red
dictators&#8221;!</p>
<p>The deep crisis of socialist rebuilding in the USSR and Communist
International, has pointed out even more the negative side of the
proletarian dictatorship in Russia. It is well known that the crisis
manifested itself from the time of Lenin&#8217;s illness, since the dominance
of the National-Bolshevik group of Stalin-Bukharin, and the expelling
of the communist opposition under Trotsky (Bolshevik-Leninists).</p>

<p>The October Revolution was the first victorious proletarian
revolution in the world. But it was obvious from the start, that
throughout the proletarian dictatorship in Russia, new class variations
with a new form of internal class struggle would surely end up being
very dangerous for the new regime, if the proletarian revolution in
other industrially advanced countries wouldn&#8217;t follow the Russian
revolution.</p>

<p>The passage to socialism and the corresponding state form of the
proletarian dictatorship fills a whole transition period. These can be
realised when the political supremacy of the proletariat is
consolidated, when the separation of the industrial city from the
farming village is slowly reduced with the help of economic development
and the great socialised and mechanised production, and when class
differences are increasingly leveled and gradually, along with these,
the state itself disappears. This transition requires an entire
historical epoch.</p>

<p>It is without doubt that the USSR, surrounded by capitalist states
and left without the support of a victorious proletarian revolution in
another large country, presents phenomena and tendencies completely
opposite, although the development of the socialist section of the
economy progresses steadily. History wanted to begin the socialist
reconstruction in a vast country with backward industry and
agricultural composition, flooded by remnants of even pre-capitalist
economic forms. The influence of the neo-capitalist and peasant
environment (Nepman-Kulak) upon the ruling communist party, manifested
itself with tendencies of gradual degeneration of the soviet and party
bureaucracy and their separation from the masses. On the other hand,
the delay of the International revolution and the successive defeats of
the agricultural proletariat, increasingly empowered the bureaucratic
elements of the party, and capitalism influenced by the neo-bourgeoisie
of the NEP, the tendencies of national self-confinement, and blurred
the internationalist perspective on which the makers of the October
Revolution based their work. But the basic proletarian nucleus of the
party, living with the experience of three revolutions, could not but
preserve their unerring class instinct in these dangerous class
differentiations of the post-revolutionary period, and all the
conscious possibilities to save the revolution from danger.</p>

<p>On this socio-economic background, the giant struggle between the
two camps of the Communist International, Stalinism and Opposition,
manifested itself and still continues. The Stalinist group, after
taking in its hands the whole of the bureaucratic mechanism of the C.I.
and the USSR, initially with mechanistic organisational measures, with
administrative and judicial persecution of its opponents,
imprisonments, exiles and systematic distortion of the views of the
opposition, after adopting the right-wing Bukharinist views, led the
party from &#8217;25 until the end of &#8217;29 to unacceptable concessions to the
new Russian bourgeoisie, and crowned its anti-Marxist deviation with
the notorious theory of socialism in one country -a theoretical utopia
and at the same time an abandonment of the revolutionary marxist
principles, of internationalism and the world revolution-, now, since
last year, turns towards the left and tries in a mechanistic way to
implement the program that the opposition formulated in the 15th
congress of the party, and for which it had been expelled from the
party, a program of methodical industrialisation and gradual
collectivisation of agricultural companies. But while on one hand the
oppositionists are still under persecution, on the other it was natural
for the centrist group of Stalin to reduce the implementation of the
oppositionist program to a kind of economic adventurism, ignoring in an
anti-Marxist manner the objective capabilities in every sector of the
economic life of the country. Thus we saw in the beginning of this year
Stalin confessing the unsettlement that the mechanistic
collectivisation brought, dumping the responsibilities, as always, to
the local organisations. Thus we heard the monstrous statement that the
Kulaks will be abolished as a class in a few years, that is, the
classless society will be established in the villages, through the
five-year plan. The practical mistakes of the ruling group of epigones
of Leninism, being incompetent to continue the work of the leader! s of
the revolution because they never assimilated their spirit and method,
despite the regurgitation of Leninist excerpts, these mistakes, it is
inevitable that they won&#8217;t lead to new class differentiations and
therefore to new dangers for the revolution. If the pretty descriptions
of the regime of the NEP were criminal mistakes, with the claim that
the NEP is almost socialism and the kulak himself would &#8220;pass into"
socialism (Bukharin), it will be today an equally deadly mistake for
the revolutionary marxists to stand by and watch the clerks of the
Stalinist bureaucracy pointing out the successes of the five-year plan
of socialist reconstruction, while at the same time closing their eyes
of the revolutionary vanguard throughout the world to the dangers that
threaten the Russian revolution from a centrist policy of ultra-right
and ultra-left zig-zags, a policy that comes now to correct
spasmodically its old mistakes, to make even worse ones in the future,
fatal for the revolution, if there is no reaction by the healthy
proletarian nucleus of the party.</p>

<p>From that point of view, the historic role of the International Left
Opposition, organisationally defeated but politically and morally
victorious, is under the current historical conditions a truly basic
and sine qua non function of the Russian revolution, a revolution that
started as a prologue, and finish as the fulfillment of the
International social revolution. Thirteen years have now passed from
the October revolution, and the one remaining from its two leaders,<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">[A]</a></sup>
is not now at the head of the task of the socialist reconstruction in
Russia, which alongside Lenin he began in 1917. Exiled by the
bureaucracy of the epigones, he is now concentrating from a shore in
Bosporus the forces of the fighting revolutionary Marxism in the whole
world. The true followers of Marx and Lenin are with the exile of
Principo as if they can hear him say: &#8220;You will not succeed in
detaching us from the Communist International, our ideas will penetrate
its bossom and find their expression in the program of the Communist
International&#8221;.</p>
