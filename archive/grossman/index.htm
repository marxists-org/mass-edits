<h3>1881-1950</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">“<em>What
was the year 1929 in the USA and the year
1931 in Germany and England if not a giant breakdown? The working class
was not prepared for this. It did not have a Lenin, who awaited and
worked towards such a moment. Rather, for decades it heard from
Hilferding and Helene Bauer that a breakdown was impossible. Only such
a disorientation of the working class made it possible for the ruling
class to overcome the panic and to survive the breakdown</em>.” </p>

<p class="index">Biography</p>
<p class="information">Henryk Grossman was born in
Krakow, in
Galicia, the Austrian-ruled section of then-partitioned Poland. Active
in the socialist movement in high-school, he joined the Polish Social
Democratic Party(PPSD). At University he became active in organizing
Jewish workers and struggled against the opportunism and chauvinism of
the PPSD. He helped lead a split of Jewish workers from the PPSD in May
1905 to form the Jewish Social Democrat Party of Galicia, and was
elected party secretary, occupying leadership positions for the next 3
years. With the defeat of the 1905 revolution and the subsequent
decline in the working class movement, he left active politics and
worked as a statistician and economist. After the war, he joined the
Communist Workers Party of Poland in 1920. Persecuted by the police and
imprisoned for several terms ranging from 2 to 8 months, repression
forced him into exile in Frankfurt at the end of 1925. He became
associated with the Frankfurt Institute and wrote his major work on
capitalist breakdown, and related articles. He was forced into exile
again in 1933, first to Britain and then the USA. He returned to
Germany in 1949, joining the Socialist Unity Party, as Professor of
Political Economy at the University of Leipzig, where he died the
following year.</p>
