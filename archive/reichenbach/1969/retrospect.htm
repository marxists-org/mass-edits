<h1>The KAPD in Retrospect</h1>
<h4>An Interview with a Member of the Communist Workers Party of Germany</h4>
<h3>1969</h3>

<hr>

<p class="information">The following interview first appeared in <i>Solidarity</i> 
Vol. 6 no. 2 when Reichenbach was a militant in the anti-parliamentary Left in 
Germany. He was interviewed by Rudi Dutschke. The footnotes have been omitted 
from this text as they are mainly short biographies of people in the text.</p>

<h3><a name="h1">The German Workers' Councils</a></h3>

<p class="fst"><b>Between 1920 and 1923, the KAPD acted as an 
extra-parliamentary opposition. Do you consider this essential?</b></p>

<p class="fst">Yes. It educated people to act on their own political initiative, 
independently of any representatives.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>At the time, this expressed itself not only as 
extra-parliamentary opposition but as anti-parliamentary opposition. Did you 
consider it essential that the working class should struggle against 
parliamentary institutions?</b></p>

<p class="fst">Definitely. You must remember that at the end of 1918 there was a 
revolutionary situation in Germany. Participation in parliamentary activity was, 
we felt, a betrayal. Parliament, amongst other things, was held responsible for 
the war. During 1919 almost the whole of left politics took place within the 
workers' councils, not in the trade unions or in parliament. The councils were 
extra-parliamentary, and potentially anti-parliamentary institutions. The 
trouble was that in these councils the Social Democrats were in a majority. They 
put forward economistic rather than political demands, and reformist rather than 
revolutionary demands. The Social Democrats, however, did not impose these 
views. Their majority reflected the will of the broad mass of the workers inside 
the councils, and that even during a revolutionary situation.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>A Leninist would argue that what was missing was a leadership 
party which would have exposed the policies of the Social Democrats on the war 
and that it was the lack of such a party that prevented the revolutionaries from 
bringing the revolutionary situation to a conclusion.</b></p>

<p class="fst">The conditions in Germany differed considerably from those in 
Russia. Russia was emerging from centuries of autocratic rule. The whole social 
atmosphere was ripe for a fundamental change. Germany had a tradition of 
parliamentary institutions, a tradition of government by elected 
representatives. In such conditions, revolution is much harder, because it 
appears as coercion against democratically-elected representatives. After all 
the years of a bourgeois majority in parliament, the victory of the Social 
Democrats appeared as a decisive victory for the left. It is true that the 
decisive arena of struggle for political power was within the workers' councils, 
but, for the reasons mentioned earlier, any action against the elected 
government appeared out of the question, especially whilst the government had a 
majority within the councils.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>What was the real activity of the councils vis-&#224;-vis the 
unions and parties?</b></p>

<p class="fst">Independent councils, based on factories rather than trades, as 
had been common previously, appeared spontaneously all over Germany. This was to 
a considerable extent a result of the economic chaos. When a factory came to a 
standstill due to a lack of fuel or raw materials, there was no one to turn to 
for help. Government, parties, unions, capitalists - no one could do anything to 
solve the basic problems of transport, fuel, raw materials etc. Resolutions, 
declarations, orders, and even paper money, were of little use. Under these 
conditions, workers would form a council, and set out to solve these problems by 
themselves. We of the KAPD believed that the trade unions were an obstacle to 
the creation of the new society, and that the main thing was to encourage 
workers to take direct action, independently of the unions.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>What was your attitude to union members, as opposed to the 
union leadership?</b></p>

<p class="fst">We continuously explained to them that it was essential to 
organise on the basis of places of work, not trades, and to establish a National 
Federation of Works Committees.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>How many revolutionary parties then existed?</b></p>

<p class="fst">In 1920 there were five parties aiming at a Socialist 
reconstruction of society, and all calling themselves Marxist: the SPD, the 
USPD, the Left USPD, the KPD and the KAPD. Apart from these, there were various 
Anarchist groups. The working class was torn by their mutual strife, and showed 
little united action vis-&#224;-vis the bourgeoisie.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>What were the differences at the level of action between the 
members of your party and the KPD, at their places of work?</b></p>

<p class="fst">The KPD at the time acted organisationally and tactically in 
precisely the same way as the Social Democrats; the only differences were in the 
slogans. We stood for workers' direct action.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Did differences already emerge at that time within the KPD 
between those who stood for the rule of the party, and those who stood for the 
rule of the councils?</b></p>

<p class="fst">That differed very much from factory to factory. Generally 
speaking, it was the social atmosphere and widespread practice for workers' 
councils to operate as recognised&#8212;almost natural&#8212;institutions.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>What were the relations between members of the rival parties 
at their places of work?</b></p>

<p class="fst">That differed from works to works, too. A single individual in a 
key role would create an atmosphere which could decide the case. Quite often 
there was excellent cooperation between members of all parties. You could almost 
always trace it to a worker in a leading role, who was respected by everybody 
due to his capacity as a leader. In other places, there would be incessant and 
acrimonious strife.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Could you describe in detail how things were organised inside 
a factory?</b></p>

<p class="fst">Not accurately. Firstly, I was not a professional worker, but a 
paid party activist. Secondly, whilst being a member of the management in a 
Berlin factory in 1920, my experience there is of little general relevance 
because the factory was owned by its workers, and there was therefore hardly any 
friction between the management and the council. It was in the privately owned 
factories that the councils would come into conflict with the management. Splits 
would occur within the ranks of the council over the question of policy towards 
the management - for example, between those who accepted the views of Social 
Democracy, and those who insisted on workers' management.</p>

<h3><a name="h2">Moscow 1921</a></h3>

<p class="fst"><b>Could you tell us something about the activity of the Third 
International?</b></p>

<p class="fst">In 1921 I participated as an observer in the sessions in Moscow. 
I stayed in the Lux Hotel. We met once a week, with Zinoviev as Chairman. The 
Russian delegation was the strongest, both in numbers and in influence. They 
ruled the meetings with an iron hand. The German delegation was the second 
largest. The tremendous influence of Lenin resulted very much from his strong 
personality. The other Russian comrades were not his yes-men. He carried them 
with him, if not by the power of his argument, then by the power of his 
personality. To European revolutionaries, Stalin was virtually unknown, and I 
never heard his name mentioned. People used to argue a lot about what this or 
that person had done or said in some situation in the past. During my stay of 
six months or so, I did not hear Stalin's name mentioned, even once.</p>

<p class="fst">I met Lenin in 1921 in his room in the Kremlin. We had a long 
discussion about the German situation. There was a big map of Russia on the 
wall, and it was obvious that Lenin was very overworked. He explained to me that 
as a ruling party, they had to manage a huge country like Russia, and he had 
hardly any time to become familiar with details of revolutionary activity in the 
West. I told him of our criticisms of the policy of the KPD, which was 
considered a sister party of the Bolsheviks. I criticised their - and his policy 
towards the insurrection of March 1921. He said that he accepted Trotsky's 
analysis on European matters, and Radek's analysis of Germany, without going 
into details. That meant that once we got into a conflict with Radek, we would 
find Lenin almost automatically lined up against us, despite the fact that quite 
often it was not he who formulated the Bolshevik line on that issue. Things were 
similar with respect to France.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>What about discussions with different Russian comrades?</b></p>

<p class="fst">There were quite a lot of these discussions, especially with 
members of the Workers Opposition. A few days before the beginning of the Third 
Congress of the Communist International, Alexandra Kollontai, then a prominent 
member of the Workers Opposition, came to my room and told me that she was going 
to attack Lenin after he had made a speech about the New Economic Policy (NEP). 
She stated that she might possibly be arrested later, and asked me whether I 
could keep in safe custody the text of her speech about the Workers Opposition. 
I said I would, and as we were sending a courier to our Executive Committee in 
Berlin, I gave it to him.</p>

<p class="fst">The session during which she delivered her famous speech for the 
Workers Opposition (which was contained in the text she had given to me) was one 
of the most memorable experiences in my life. Lenin, Trotsky, Radek, Zinoviev, 
Bukharin and others sat on the platform. She stood with her back to them, facing 
the audience, which included revolutionary militants from all over the world. 
She spoke first in fluent German, which was the official language of the 
International. When she finished, she repeated the whole lot in French for the 
benefit of the French comrades. She probably didn't trust the interpreter. 
Finally, she repeated the whole speech in Russian. When she finished, silence 
fell. Lenin didn't say a single word, although he took notes all the time. 
Trotsky answered for the platform. He tried to play the whole thing down, to the 
effect that she was a 'softy', and far too sensitive for the tough business 
called revolution, which demanded an iron hand. Neither of the speakers dealt 
directly with her arguments or facts. The line was to play the whole criticism 
down by reducing it to a matter of her personality.</p>

<p class="fst">Behind the scenes, Trotsky took her in hand. She gave in, 
capitulating to party discipline. A few days later she came to me, and wanted 
her manuscript back. I was, of course, unable to return it to her. Later my 
comrades translated the manuscript into German, and published it under the title 
of Alexandra Kollontai's <i><a href="../../kollonta/1921/workers-opposition/index.htm">Die Arbeiter Opposition in Russland</a></i>. When I 
returned to Berlin, the KAPD decided that there was no point in remaining an 
associate member of the Third International.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>What was the attitude of Lenin and Trotsky to your party?</b></p>

<p class="fst">It was critical, although at first fraternal. They very much 
wanted that we should join the KPD, and give up our independent organisation. 
But the policy of the KPD, dictated by the Russians, made this impossible. It 
was obvious, as I said, that the KPD had become a tool of Russian foreign 
policy.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>What can you tell us about the 1921 insurrection?</b></p>

<p class="fst">At the time I was in Russia. The uprising, the so-called 'March 
Action', had been undertaken by the local organisations of the KPD and the KAPD, 
the former in response to an instruction from the Russian emissary B&#233;la Kun (the 
exiled leader of the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919). At first, 
the March Action was approved by Lenin. After its failure, however, he changed 
his mind, mainly under the influence of Clara Zetkin, a member of the Central 
Committee of the KPD, and Paul Levi, another Central Committee member, who 
resigned from the leadership of the party, and denounced the uprising as a 
'putsch'. He did this in a pamphlet which was damned by Lenin and Trotsky, 
although they shared his criticism. Paul Levi's policies were continued.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Do you believe that there was a connection between the New 
Economic Policy of 1921 and the policy of the Third International towards the 
'March Action'?</b></p>

<p class="fst">One can discern some underlying common factors. The NEP was 
considered by Lenin as a fortification of the revolution in Russia; he 
considered the revolutionary process as having come to an end. The Bolsheviks 
had expected a victorious revolution in Western Europe. This failed to 
materialise, thus creating an ambiguous relationship between them, as a ruling 
party, and the capitalist regimes in Europe. On the one hand, they wanted normal 
inter-state relations, which would ensure them peaceful borders. On the other 
hand, the revolutionary struggle inside the capitalist countries weakened their 
regimes. Once the Bolsheviks became disillusioned with the revolution in the 
West, they began to consider the revolutionary movements as auxiliary tools of 
Russian foreign policy. That did not start with Stalin, but with Lenin and 
Trotsky, back in 1921. In 1921 Krasin, People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, 
warned in an interview with the Berlin <i>Rote Fahne</i> (the daily paper of the 
KPD) that a particular strike would interfere with deliveries of machinery being 
manufactured for the USSR.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">In Retrospect</a></h3>

<p class="fst"><b>Why did the KAPD disband in 1923?</b></p>

<p class="fst">Actually, the party did not disband in 1923. When the 'March 
Action' failed (and later the 1923 insurrection also), only a few hundred 
activists remained. Originally, we were a party of industrial militants, with 
only a few paid functionaries. When the industrial activity of these militants 
died down, our party simply ceased to exist. It was not a matter of taking a 
political decision. When our militants ceased to be active, all that was left to 
do was to acknowledge the situation, and draw the appropriate conclusions. We, 
the younger activists, decided to enter other political parties, simply because 
this was the only place where we could meet politically-minded workers, and try 
to win them over.</p>

<p class="fst">We failed for a number of reasons. Firstly, during our best 
period, in 1921, we numbered only 30 000, this being very small out of a 
proletariat of many millions. Secondly, we overestimated the revolutionary 
potential of the workers, and the role of the economic factor as an initiator of 
revolutionary activity. In this respect, our political adversaries Ebert and 
Scheidemann of the Social Democratic Party had a more realistic understanding 
when they concluded that a struggle for economic improvement can be contained by 
means of reform, and need not lead to revolution. Perhaps we erred in our 
analysis of society by considering it to revolve mainly on the economic axis, 
although in the 1920s this was certainly the main factor.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Did you consider yourself a Marxist at the time?</b></p>

<p class="fst">Yes, I and most of my comrades considered ourselves as people who 
put Marx's ideas into action, according to our interpretation of them. 
Naturally, every self-defined Marxist will be criticised by other Marxists for 
the non-authenticity of his interpretation. In general, our tendency to 
over-emphasise the role of 'objective factors' stemmed from our interpretation 
of Marx's ideas, and contributed to our failure. I think that Marx's stress on 
the economic factor as the main motivation for revolutionary activity is not 
always right and everywhere valid; whereas his sociological insights were right 
at the time.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Assuming your analysis of society was valid at the time, as 
you just said, where then do you locate your failures?</b></p>

<p class="fst">A valid social analysis is one thing, implementing it in reality 
is another altogether. One should distinguish between the theories of the KAPD 
and the practice through which it attempted to implement them (although the two 
were obviously interrelated). Up to 1923 the revolutionary activity of the 
working class was widespread throughout Germany in the wake of the collapse of 
the Kaiser regime, and of its political, social, economic and ideological 
institutions. But following the defeat of the insurrections of March 1921 and 
later of 1923, it became evident that, whereas during periods of political 
collapse and economic misery the working class exhibits independent 
revolutionary initiative and readiness to sacrifice a lot for the creation of a 
new social order, it does not sustain this type of activity during the prolonged 
periods between one political-economic crisis and the next.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Do you think that the non-materialisation of any revolution in 
Germany was a product of objective factors, or that it was due to the failure of 
the subjective&#8212;revolutionary&#8212;factor?</b></p>

<p class="fst">It is impossible to give a decisive answer to such a question. 
Objective factors can create conditions for a revolution, but its realisation 
depends on the subjective factor. Owing to our interpretation of Marx's theory, 
we considered the subjective factor as of minor significance when compared to 
the objective factors. We suffered from a tendency to base all our activity on 
'economic determinism'.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Did not Luk&#225;cs criticise this tendency in 1924?</b></p>

<p class="fst">He did. On the other hand, Lenin also attacked us from the other 
side (in his famous Left Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder), accusing us of 
adventurism, by which he meant depending too much on the subjective factor. 
Gorter, one of our Dutch co-thinkers, wrote an excellent <a href="../../gorter/1920/open-letter/index.htm">reply</a>.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Who was Anton Pannekoek?</b></p>

<p class="fst">He was a Dutch astronomer, who, before the First World War, 
edited a revolutionary paper in Bremen. Karl Radek, who later became a Bolshevik 
expert on Germany, learnt his revolutionary theory from him whilst working on 
the paper. In 1917 Pannekoek and Herman Gorter defended the Russian Revolution. 
When the Russians instituted a Western European Bureau of the Comintern in 1919, 
Pannekoek and Gorter were among those put in charge of it.</p>

<p class="fst">Their later criticisms of the Bolsheviks concerned mainly their 
analyse of and policies towards the working class and revolutionary movements in 
Western Europe, and their lack of understanding of the workers in the 
industrialised West. They pointed out that what was suitable for Russian 
conditions was not necessarily applicable to the entirely different conditions 
in the West. They made a very detailed and fraternal critique of Lenin's 
policies, to which Lenin never replied in kind. Instead, he declared: "History 
will decide who was right!"</p>
