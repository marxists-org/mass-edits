<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="fst">George Lukacs, the author of <em>What is Orthodox Marxism</em>, is
one of the strangest figures of twentieth century socialism. For he
is simultaneously one of the few really creative Marxist minds of his
time and a man who has betrayed the ideals of the revolution to the
Stalinist regime. The many paradoxes of his life were brought to a
fitting climax in October 1956, when, after thirty one years of
faithful service to totalitarianism, he emerged as one of the central
intellectual leaders of the Hungarian Revolution.</p>

<p>Lukacs was born in Hungary in 1885 of a well-to-do family. As a
young man, he was drawn to Kantian philosophy, and a little later to
the sociology of Max Weber. Lukacs&rsquo; reputation developed early.
A book of his published when he was in his mid-twenties caught the
eye of Thomas Mann and the two developed a personal relationship.
Later, according to Jean Duvignaud, this friendship was the source of
Mann&rsquo;s portrait of Naphta, the strange theological communist,
in the <strong>Magic Mountain</strong>.</p>

<p>During the first War, Lukacs personal world fell to pieces under
the strain of the social carnage. His work of this period, such as
the <strong>Theory of the Novel</strong>, is marked by a sort of expressionist
despair, and is filled with descriptions of the &ldquo;unbridgeable
abyss&rdquo; between the &ldquo;I&rdquo; and the world. And yet, in
1919, Lukacs participated in the Soviet Hungarian Government of Bela
Kun. In this period, he was decisively drawn to Marxism, and though
he submitted his convictions to the terrible distortions of Stalinist
ideology, this commitment persisted up to the present.</p>

<p><em>What is Orthodox Marxism</em> is an essay taken from the
collection, <strong>Geschichte und Klassenbewusstsein</strong> (<strong>History and
Class Consciousness</strong>). These essays, written during the period of
the revolutionary wave after World War I, were condemned at the Fifth
Congress of the Communist International by Zinoviev as &ldquo;idealistic.&rdquo;
At that time, Lukacs made a complete and total submission to the
Party. He lived in Moscow for years, and when called upon made sharp
&ldquo;self-criticisms&rdquo; of himself in the most classic
Stalinist fashion (the most recent was only some seven or eight years
ago; the confession of not having been sufficiently aware of
contemporary Russian literature).</p>

<p>And yet, even during the period of Lukacs&rsquo; most abject
submission to the Party line, he continued to write brilliant Marxist
literary criticism. This was smuggled in past the required statements
that Stalin was the most brilliant aesthetician of the epoch, the
continuator of the work of Marx, Engels and Lenin. He was, of course,
most affected by his Stalinist commitment in his discussion of
current writers &ndash; he denounced Franz Mehring, for example, as a
&ldquo;literary Trotskyist,&rdquo; and found the historical novels of
the German popular front to be a major turning point in the history
of that country&rsquo;s literature.</p>

<p>Then a change took place. In the period before the Hungarian
Revolution, Lukacs was one of the central leaders of the intellectual
ferment. Indeed, his influence was not confined to Hungary. Wolfgang
Hairich, the young German academician who was recently sentenced to
jail for his oppositional activities was a &ldquo;Lukacsian,&rdquo;
and his authority is great in Communist circles in various Communist
Parties. Lukacs went into exile along with Imre Nagy. Since then,
there have been reports that he was going to support the Kadar regime
(mainly in <strong>France-Observateur</strong>), or that he was going to be
tried, but there has been no substantiation.</p>

<p>This is not the place to go into an extended criticism of Lukacs&rsquo;
work. Suffice it to say that the ideas in <em>What is Marxism</em>
represent a brilliant study of the Marxian dialectic, though modified
by a certain tendency toward the more Hegelian aspects of Marxist
thought. This latter point raises various difficulties for a
translator. Where there is a real ambiguity, I have placed the German
word in parenthesis after the English translation of it.</p>

<p class="fst">This question, actually a simple one, has become the object of
wide discussion, in the bourgeois as well as in the worker&rsquo;s
milieu. It has become the scientific fashion to ridicule all
pretensions of faith in a Marxist orthodoxy. For there is little
agreement in the &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; camp as to what constitutes
the quintessence of Marxism, and what theses one can attack, or even
reject, without surrendering the title to &ldquo;orthodox Marxism.&rdquo;
As a result, it has come to seem more and more non-scientific to make
scholastic exegeses of old books as in the tradition of Biblical
scholarship, books which the modern criticism has &ldquo;gone
beyond.&rdquo; It is considered wrong to seek in these texts, and
only there, the source of truth. The tendency is to turn toward the
study of the &ldquo;facts,&rdquo; and this &ldquo;without any
prejudices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If these two approaches were the real alternatives, then the best
response would be a simple smile of pity. But the question isn&rsquo;t
as easy as all that, and never has been. Admit for the sake of
argument that all of the particular affirmations of Marx have been
shown to be factually inaccurate by modern scholarship. A serious
Marxist can recognize all this new evidence, reject all of the
particular theses of Marx, and yet not be forced for an instant to
renounce his Marxist orthodoxy. For orthodox Marxism does not mean an
uncritical acceptance of the results of Marx&rsquo; research, it is
not the exegeses of a &ldquo;sacred book&rdquo; or &ldquo;faith&rdquo;
in this or that thesis. In Marxism, orthodoxy refers solely and
exclusively to the question of <em>method.</em> It implies the
scientific conviction that the Marxist dialectic is the right method
of investigation, and that this method cannot be developed,
perfected, or made more profound except in the tradition of its
founders. Further, Marxist orthodoxy understands that all attempts to
go beyond this method, or to &ldquo;improve&rdquo; it, necessarily
trivialize it and end up in eclecticism.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="fst">THE MATERIALIST DIALECTIC IS a revolutionary dialectic. This is so
crucial for its understanding that, if we want to pose the issue
sharply, we must confront this essential point even before we can
treat of the dialectic method itself. The problem is that of theory
and practice. But we cannot limit it to the sense of Marx&rsquo;
first critique of Hegel that &ldquo;the theory becomes a material
force when it takes hold among the masses.&rdquo; More than that, we
must study each element, each determination of the theory which makes
it a vehicle for revolution; we cannot concern ourselves only with
the way in which it penetrates the masses. In short, we must develop
the practical essence from the point of view of the theory and the
relation which it establishes with its object. Otherwise, this
&ldquo;taking hold of the masses&rdquo; would be an empty idea. It
could then be that the masses are moved by a range of motives and are
impelled toward various ends &ndash; and that the theory has only an
accidental relation to the movement, that it is only the form under
which the consciousness of the socially necessary or contingent
action develops, and that without the theory the action would be
essentially and actually related to the consciousness.</p>

<p>Marx, in the passage quoted from, clearly expressed the conditions
under which a relation between theory and practice is possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not enough that the thought tends toward reality,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;the reality itself must move in the direction of the
thought.&rdquo; Or, in another context, &ldquo;it will be
demonstrated that the world has had for a long time the dream of a
thing which it has failed to possess in reality solely because it
lacks the consciousness.&rdquo; Only such a relation between
consciousness and reality makes possible the unity of theory and
&ldquo;praxis.&rdquo; It is only when consciousness coincides with
the <em>decisive course</em> which the historical process must take
toward its proper end (an end which is constituted by human freedom
but which does not depend upon arbitrary human freedom, an end which
is not an invention of the human spirit), that theory can serve its
historic role and make this course actually possible. When one
confronts a situation where the exact knowledge of society becomes,
for a class, the immediate condition of its self-affirmation in
struggle; when, for this class, self consciousness means
simultaneously the accurate consciousness of all society; when this
class is, by its consciousness, both the subject and object of
consciousness; then the theory is in an immediate, direct and
adequate relation with the process of the social revolution, then the
unity of theory and practice, that pre-condition of the revolutionary
function of the theory, becomes possible.</p>

<p>Such a situation has emerged with the appearance of the
proletariat in history. &ldquo;When the proletariat,&rdquo; writes
Marx, &ldquo;announces the dissolution of the existing social order,
it reveals the secret of its proper existence, which itself
constitutes the effective dissolution of this social order.&rdquo;
The theory which makes this statement is not related to the
revolution in a more or less contingent way, it is not bound loosely
to it, or through a &ldquo;misunderstanding.&rdquo; Rather, it is, in
its very essence, nothing more than the thinking expression of the
revolutionary process itself. Each stage of this process is fixed
deeply in theory so as to become, by its generalization,
communicable, useful, susceptible to development. And just as it is
the consciousness of a necessary development, so it becomes at the
same time the necessary precondition of the development which must
follow.</p>

<p>The clarification of this function of the theory opens up the way
to a knowledge of its very essence: that is, of the dialectic method.
Ignoring this simple and decisive point has introduced a tremendous
confusion into the discussion of the dialectic. For whether one
criticizes Engels&rsquo; formulations in <strong>Anti-D&uuml;hring</strong>
(crucial for the further development of theory), or whether one
conceives the book as incomplete, even as inadequate, or considers it
as a classic, it must be generally recognized that it is deficient in
precisely this aspect. In effect, Engels conceptualizes the dialectic
by opposing it to the &ldquo;metaphysical&rdquo; conceptualization.
He emphasizes with penetration the fact that, in the dialectic
method, the rigidity of concepts (and of the objects which correspond
to them) is dissolved, that the dialectic is the continuous process
of the continuous transformation of one determination into another,
resolving contraries which pass into each other. And he argues that,
consequently, the unilateral, rigid causality must be replaced by
reciprocal action. But the most essential interaction, <em>the
dialectical relation of subject and object in the process of history</em>,
is not even mentioned, not to say placed in the very center of the
methodological consideration where it belongs. Abstracted from this
determination the dialectic method, in spite of any affirmation in
the last instance of &ldquo;fluid&rdquo; concepts, ceased to be a
revolutionary method. The difference between the dialectic and
&ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo; should not then be sought in the fact that
all metaphysical studies require the object of investigation to be
untouched and unchanging, and that the conception consequently
remains &ldquo;contemplative&rdquo;&rsquo; (<em>anschauende</em>) and
cannot become practical, but in the fact that for the dialectic the
central problem is the <em>transformation of reality</em>.</p>

<p>If one neglects this central function of the theory, then the
advantage of a &ldquo;fluid&rdquo; conception becomes problematic, a
purely &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; affair. The method can be accepted or
rejected in accord with the state of science, but without changing
one&rsquo;s attitude toward the question of whether reality is
changeable or immutable. The impenetrability of reality, its &ldquo;fatal&rdquo;
and unchanging character, its conformity to law in the sense of
bourgeois, contemplative materialism and its classical economics,
this can even be reinforced as it was among those Machians who were
adepts at Marxism. The fact that Mach&rsquo;s thought could produce
voluntarism &ndash; equally bourgeois &ndash; does not contradict
this point. Fatalism and voluntarism are only contradictory in a
non-dialectic, non-historic perspective. In the dialectic conception
of history, these are polarities united by a single bond, they are
the simple play of purely intellectual reflections which express the
antagonism of the capitalist order and its inability of resolving its
own problems on its own terms.</p>

<p>This is why all attempts to deepen the dialectic method in a
&ldquo;critical&rdquo; manner necessarily end up as a degradation. In
effect, the methodological point of departure for the &ldquo;critical&rdquo;
position consists precisely in separating method and reality, thought
and being. In this separation, this point of view sees a valuable
progress, the attainment of an authentically scientific science which
is opposed to the gross and non-critical method of Marxism. These
people are free, of course, to make their point. But then it must be
recognized that they are not moving in the direction which leads to
the very essence of the dialectic method.</p>

<p>Marx and Engels have expressed this unambiguously. Engels wrote,
&ldquo;By this, the dialectic was reduced to the science of general
laws of movement, laws of the exterior world as well as of human
thought &ndash; to two series of laws ... identical in substance.&rdquo;
And Marx put it even more precisely, &ldquo;As in all social and
historical sciences, one must always realize when considering the
movement of economic categories, that the categories express the
forms and conditions of existence ...&rdquo; <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>
When this sense of the dialectic is obscured, then it necessarily
appears as a useless supplement, an ornament to the &ldquo;sociology&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;economics&rdquo; of Marxism. It seems to be an obstacle
to the &ldquo;sober and impartial&rdquo; study of the &ldquo;facts,&rdquo;
as an empty construction by means of which Marxism does violence to
the facts. Bernstein has expressed this objection to the dialectic
method in the most precise and clear fashion, in the name of his
&ldquo;impartiality,&rdquo; a concept untroubled by any philosophic
comprehension. Still he shows us the very real political and economic
consequences which he deduces from this desire to liberate method
from the &ldquo;dialectic trap&rdquo; of Hegelianism; he indicates
where his approach leads. For Bernstein demonstrates that one must
separate the dialectic from historical materialism if one wishes to
originate a serious theory of the opportunities of &ldquo;evolution&rdquo;
without revolution, of a transition to socialism without struggle.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="fst">BUT THIS IMMEDIATELY RAISES a question: what is the meaning from
the point of view of method of these facts which are so adored in
revisionist literature? In what measure can one see in them the
factors for the orientation of the revolutionary proletariat?
Obviously, all knowledge of reality starts with facts. But then the
problem is: which data (and in which methodological context must it
be placed), should be considered relevant for our understanding? A
narrow empiricism denies that a fact does not really become a fact
except in the course of an elaboration according to a method. It
finds in each bit of data, in each statistic, in each &ldquo;<em>factum
brutus</em>&rdquo; of the economic life, an important fact. It does
not understand that the simplest enumeration of &ldquo;facts,&rdquo;
an ordering of them completely devoid of commentary, is already an
interpretation, that at this stage the facts are already examined
from a point of view, a method, that they have been abstracted from
the living context in which they were found and introduced into a
theory. The opportunists are more refined despite their repugnance to
theory. They do not deny all this, but rather base themselves upon
the method of natural science, the manner in which it investigates
the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; fact through observation, abstraction and
experimentation, its ability to discover interrelations. And they
oppose this as an ideal of knowledge to the violent constructions of
the dialectic.</p>

<p>The insidious character of such a method is that capitalism
itself, in the course of its development, produces a social structure
which meets it halfway. And here, we must have recourse to the
dialectic method so that we will not be taken in by this social
illusion, so that we will be able to go behind the facade and
discover the real essence of the matter. The &ldquo;pure&rdquo; facts
of the natural sciences come into being in the following manner: a
phenomenon is transported from life into a context which permits us
to study the laws which it obeys without the disturbing intervention
of other phenomenon (this is done either actually, or in the mind);
this procedure is then reinforced by the fact that the phenomena are
reduced to their quantitative essence, to their numerical expression
and relations. And what the opportunists do not understand is that it
is of the very essence of capitalism to produce phenomena in such a
way. Marx described a &ldquo;process of abstraction&rdquo; from
existence in his treatment of labor, but he did not forget to insist
vigorously that in this case he was dealing with a characteristic of
capitalist society: &ldquo;Thus, the most general abstractions do not
commonly develop except in the course of the richest, most concrete
evolution where one feature seems to be jointly possessed by many
things, and is common to all of them. Then it ceases to be thought of
uniquely, under its particular form.&rdquo; This tendency of
capitalist evolution has now developed considerably. The fetishistic
character of economic forms, the reification of all human relations,
the increasing extention of a division of labor which, with an
abstract rationality, atomizes the process of production without
regard for the human capacities and potentialities of the actual
producers, etc., this process transforms the phenomena of society and
with them our perceptions of them. Now &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; facts
appear, there are groups of isolated facts and specific sectors which
have their own laws (economic theory, law, etc), and these seem to
have paved the way, in their very immediate reality, for this kind of
scientific study. Thus, it appears to be &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; to
raise to the level of science a tendency which is inherent in the
facts themselves. But the dialectic insists upon the concrete unity
of the whole in opposition to all of these isolated facts and partial
systems, it unmasks this illusion of appearances which is necessarily
produced by capitalism.</p>

<p>The unscientific nature of this seemingly scientific method
resides in the fact that it does not perceive the <em>historical
character</em> of the facts which it uses as its basis, indeed that it
ignores this historical character. But we do not have here simply
that source of error which Engels called to our attention. The
essence of this source of error is located in the fact that
statistics, and the &ldquo;exact&rdquo; economic theory which are
built upon them, lag behind actual developments. &ldquo;For
contemporary history, one will often be forced to treat the most
decisive factor as constant, assuming that the economic situation
which is found at the beginning of the period continues throughout
the period without variation, or else take notice of such changes in
this situation as arise out of patently manifest events themselves
and are, therefore, quite obvious.&rdquo; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>
But in the fact that capitalist society meets the natural sciences
halfway, that it is the social precondition of its exactitude, in
this state of affairs, there is something completely problematic. If,
then, the internal structure of &ldquo;facts&rdquo; and their
relations is essentially known in a historic manner, if they are seen
as implicated in a process of uninterrupted revolution, we must ask
where the greatest inexactitude lies. It is when the &ldquo;facts&rdquo;
are perceived under a form of objectivity wherein they are dominated
by laws which I know with a methodological certainty (or at least,
probability) are not valid for these facts? Or is it when I
consciously recognize the consequences of this situation and
therefore adopt a critical attitude toward the certitude which is
achieved, concentrating upon the moments in which this historic
character, this decisive modification, actually manifests itself?</p>

<p>Thus, the historical character of the &ldquo;facts&rdquo; which
science believes it perceives in their &ldquo;purity&rdquo; is fatal
to this illusion. As products of historical evolution, these facts
are not only involved in continual change. More than that, they are &ndash;
<em>precisely in the structure of their objectivity &ndash; the
product of a specific historic epoch: that of capitalism</em>.
Consequently, a &ldquo;science&rdquo; which takes the immediacy of
the facts as its basis, which sees this form of their objectivity as
the point of departure for scientific conceptualization, places
itself simply and dogmatically upon the terrain of capitalist
society. Essentially, it accepts uncritically the structure of the
object as it is given, and it takes its laws as the immutable
fundament of &ldquo;science.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To move from such &ldquo;facts&rdquo; to facts in the true sense
of the word, one must penetrate behind the historic conditioning of
the facts; one cannot accept them as given and immediate. In short,
the facts must be submitted to a historical dialectical treatment,
for as Marx has noted, &ldquo;The finished form which economic
relations manifest upon their surface in their actual existence, and
consequently the representations of them out of which the bearers and
agents of these relations seek to develop a clear idea of them, these
are quite different from the inner form which is essential but
hidden, they are different from the concept which really corresponds
to the form.&rdquo; <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> If the facts are
to be known accurately, we must understand the difference between
their immediate appearance and inner core (<em>kern</em>) with clarity
and precision; we must distinguish between the representation of the
fact, and the concept of it. This <em>distinction is the first
pre-condition of</em> scientific study which, as Marx pointed out,
&ldquo;would be superfluous if the phenomenal manifestation and the
essence of things were immediately identical.&rdquo; Thus, we must go
behind the immediate appearance of facts and discover the core, the
essence. In doing so, we will understand their appearance as the
necessary form which their inner core takes &ndash; necessary because
of the historic character of facts, because they are posed on the
terrain of capitalist society. This double determination which
simultaneously recognizes and goes beyond the immediate fact, this is
precisely the dialectical relation.</p>

<p>The internal structure of <strong>Capital</strong> thus causes precisely the
greatest difficulty to the superficial reader who uncritically
accepts the categories of thought proper to capitalist development.
On the one hand the exposition pushes the capitalist character of the
economic forms to its extreme limit and constitutes a perspective in
which these categories are pure and describe a society which
&ldquo;corresponds to theory,&rdquo; indeed, a society completely
capitalist, composed only of proletarians and capitalists. But on the
other hand, as soon as this conception is worked out, as soon as the
world of phenomena seems to be crystallized theoretically, this
result itself dissolves into a simple appearance, it is seen as a
simple inverted selection of a group of facts which are themselves
inverted, a selection which is nothing but &ldquo;the conscious
expression of the apparent movement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only in this context can one integrate the different facts of
social life (in as much as they are elements of a historic becoming)
into a <em>totality</em>, only in this way does the knowledge of facts
become the knowledge of <em>reality</em>. This knowledge begins with
simple determinations which are pure, immediate and natural (to the
capitalist world). It goes from them to a knowledge of the concrete
totality as the conceptual reproduction of reality. This concrete
totality is, of course, never immediately apparent. &ldquo;The
concrete is concrete,&rdquo; Marx writes, &ldquo;because it is the
synthesis of many determinations, i.e, the unity of diverse elements&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at this point, idealism falls into the error of confusing the
conceptual reproduction of reality with the structural process of
reality itself. For &ldquo;in our thought, reality appears as a
process of synthesis, as a result, and not as a starting point,
although it is the real starting point and, therefore, also the
starting point of observation and conception.&rdquo; On the other
hand, vulgar materialism &ndash; even, as in the case of Bernstein
and others, it is most modern in form &ndash; is content to reproduce
the most immediate and simple determinations of social life. It feels
that it is particularly &ldquo;exact&rdquo; in accepting these
determinations without any serious analysis, without relating them to
the concrete totality, it takes the facts in an abstract isolation
and attempts to explain them by abstract scientific laws which are
not a part of the concrete totality. &ldquo;The crudity and
shortcomings of this conception,&rdquo; wrote Marx, &ldquo;lie in the
tendency to see but an accidental, reflexive connection in that which
is really an organic union.&rdquo; <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>The conceptual grossness and emptiness of such an approach is
located, above all, in the fact that it obscures the historic and
transitory character of capitalist society. In it, its determinations
appear as timeless and eternal categories common to all social
orders. This was apparent in its most obvious form in bourgeois
economics, but vulgar Marxism soon took the same path. The dialectic
method, with its methodological dominance of the totality over the
particular aspect was destroyed, the part no longer found its
conception and reality in the whole but, on the contrary, the whole
was eliminated from investigation as an unscientific element (or was
reduced to a simple &ldquo;idea,&rdquo; to a sum of the parts). And
as soon as this was done, the reflexive relations of isolated
elements appeared to be the eternal law of all human society. Marx&rsquo;
formulation that &ldquo;the relations of production of a given
society form a whole&rdquo; is, in opposition to this approach, the
methodological point of departure, it is the key to the <em>historical
understanding</em> of social relations. All isolated and partial
categories can be conceived (in their isolation) as having always
been present during the evolution of human society. (If one doesn&rsquo;t
find them in a particular social form, then that is the exception
that proves the rule.) Thus, the real stages of social evolution are
unclear and ambiguous when they are viewed as changes which take
place among isolated, partial elements. And they are most clear when
seen in terms of the <em>change in function</em> of the various
elements in the whole process of history, in the alterations of their
relations to the totality of society.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="fst">THIS DIALECTICAL CONCEPTION OF reality seems to be far distant
from the immediate reality, it appears to construct its relations in
a non-scientific fashion. Yet it is, in fact, the only method of
conceptually knowing and reproducing reality.</p>

<p>The concrete totality is thus the fundamental category of reality.
<a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> The correctness of this perspective
becomes apparent when we place the real, material substratum of our
method &ndash; capitalist society with its internal antagonism
between the forces and relations of production &ndash; at the very
center of our study. The method of the natural sciences, the ideal
method of all reflexive science and of all revisionism, does not
recognize contradiction and antagonism in its object. If it
nevertheless encounters a contradiction between different theories,
it conceives this situation as a consequence of the incompleteness of
knowledge which has been achieved.</p>

<p>Thus, theories which seem to be in contradiction are thought to
have the limits of their validity established by that fact, and they
are modified and subsumed under more general theories in which these
contradictions decisively disappear. But in the case of the social
reality, these contradictions are not a result of insufficient
scientific comprehension. <em>They belong, rather to the very essence
of reality, to the essence of capitalist society.</em> And they will
not be subsumed under the knowledge of the totality so as to suppress
the contradiction. On the contrary, they will be understood as a
necessary development out of the antagonistic capitalist order of
production.</p>

<p>Thus, when theory, (taken as the knowledge of the whole) opens up
the way to a resolution of the contradictions, it does so by showing
<em>real tendencies</em> of social development which must <em>actually</em>
resolve these contradictions which emerge in the course of social
evolution.</p>

<p>In this perspective, the opposition between the &ldquo;critical&rdquo;
method (or vulgar materialism, Machism, etc.) is a social problem.
The method of the natural sciences can only serve the progress of
science when it is applied to nature. But used to understand the
evolution of society, it is an instrument of the ideological struggle
of the bourgeoisie. It is vital for the bourgeoisie to conceive of
its own order of production in terms of categories which have a
timeless validity; it must see capitalism as destined to an eternal
existence because of the laws of nature and reason. Conversely, it
judges the contradictions which are inevitably imposed upon its
thought as surface facts and not as phenomena which belong to the
very essence of capitalism.</p>

<p>The method of classical economy is a product of this ideological
function of bourgeois thought. And its limitations as a scientific
approach are a consequence of the social reality, of the antagonistic
character of capitalist production. If a thinker of the stature of a
Ricardo denied the &ldquo;necessity of the expansion of the market
corresponding to the augmentation of production and the increase of
capital,&rdquo; he did so (unconsciously, to be sure) in order to
escape recognizing the necessity of crises. For these crises reveal
in the most obvious and fundamental fashion the basic antagonism of
capitalist production and the fact that &ldquo;the bourgeois mode of
production implies a limitation of the free development of the
productive forces.&rdquo; But then Ricardo&rsquo;s error in good
faith became the consciously misleading analysis of bourgeois society
put forward by the vulgar economists.</p>

<p>Vulgar Marxism came to the very same pass &ndash; whether it was
trying to eliminate the dialectic method from proletarian science in
a systematic fashion, or was affirming the dialectic &ldquo;critically.&rdquo;
Thus, to cite a grotesque case, Max Adler attempted to separate the
dialectic as method, as the movement of thought, from the dialectic
of being, as a metaphysic. At the very summit of his &ldquo;critique,&rdquo;
he comes up with the dialectic in so far as it is &ldquo;a matter of
positive science,&rdquo; which &ldquo;one thinks of in the first
place when one speaks of a real dialectic in Marxism.&rdquo; Then he
terms this dialectic more accurately as an &ldquo;antagonism ...
which simply demonstrates that an opposition exists between the
egoistic interest of the individual and the social forms in which he
finds himself.&rdquo; By this stroke, the objective economic
antagonism which expresses itself in the <em>class struggle</em> is
dissolved into a conflict between the <em>individual and society.</em>
On such a basis, one cannot understand the necessity of the
emergence, internal problems and decline of capitalist society. The
end result is, willy-nilly, a Kantian philosophy of history. And
conversely, this approach makes the structure of bourgeois society
universal, the form of society in general, because the central
problem which Max Adler attacks, that of the &ldquo;dialectic, or
rather the antagonism,&rdquo; is none other than a typical
ideological form of the capitalist social order. Thus it matters
little in the final analysis whether the eternalization of capitalism
takes place in terms of economics or of philosophy, whether it is
done naively and with innocence or with extreme critical refinement.</p>

<p>In this perspective, the rejection or destruction of the dialectic
method means that history looses its intelligibility. This doesn&rsquo;t
imply, of course, that an exact description of certain personalities,
or historic epochs, is impossible outside of the dialectic method. It
does mean that one cannot understand history as a unitary process
without the dialectic method. (This impossibility is expressed in
bourgeois science. On the one hand, there are the abstract and
sociological constructions of historical development of the type of
Spence or August Comte &ndash; whose internal contradictions have
been exposed by modem bourgeois historians, particularly by Rickert.
And on the other hand, there are the exigencies of a &ldquo;philosophy
of history&rdquo; whose very relation to historical reality appears
as a methodologically insoluble problem.)</p>

<p>This opposition between a particular aspect of history and history
conceived as a unitary process is not a simple matter of differing
scope, as for example it is in the case of the difference between
particular and universal history. Rather it involves methodological
contradiction, it counterposes points of view. The problem of the
unitary understanding of the historic process is necessarily posed at
the very center of the study of each epoch, of each partial sector of
history, etc. And it is here that the decisive importance of the
dialectic conception of reality reveals itself for we see that it is
possible to describe a historical event with essential accuracy
without being able to understand the event as it actually happened,
without comprehending its real function in the historic whole, in the
unity of the historic process. A typical example of such a
development is that of Sismondi&rsquo;s treatment of the problem of
crisis. He understands the immanent evolutionary tendencies of
production as well as of distribution, he makes a penetrating
critique of capitalism. And yet, he is ultimately stranded. For he
remains nevertheless a prisoner of capitalist objectivity and must
conceive of the two immanent tendencies as independent of each other.
&ldquo;He does not understand that the relations of distribution are
nothing but the relations of production <em>sub alia specie</em>.&rdquo;
And thus, he is the victim of the same fate which overtook the false
dialectic of Proudhon: &ldquo;he transforms the different partial
elements of society into so many societies in themselves.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">WE REPEAT: THE CATEGORY of totality does not suppress the
constituent elements and dissolve them into an undifferentiated
unity, into an identity. The manifest form of their independence, of
their autonomy (an autonomy which they possess in the order of
capitalist production) will seem to be a pure appearance only if they
are not conceived of dialectically, as the dynamic moments of a whole
which is, itself, equally dialectic and dynamic.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The result which we move toward,&rdquo; wrote
Marx, &ldquo;is not that we say that production, exchange and
consumption are identical, but rather that they are the members which
form a totality, the difference at the center of a unity ... A
certain form of production thus determines certain forms of
consumption, distribution and exchange and <em>certain mutual
relations between these different aspects</em> ... There is a
reciprocal influence between these different aspects at the same time
as the problem is one of an organic totality.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">But then, we cannot stop at the category of reciprocal action. For
one can think of reciprocal action as the simple, reciprocal causal
action of two objects which are otherwise unchangeable, and not
advance a single stop toward the understanding of social reality.
This is the case with the univocal causality of vulgar materialism
(or the functional relations of Machism, etc.). There is, for
example, a reciprocal action when a billiard ball at rest is pushed
by another ball into movement. The first is placed in movement; the
second modifies its direction because of the contact, etc. ... But
the reciprocal action of which we speak goes far beyond such a case,
beyond that which takes place between objects which are otherwise
unchaining. And to do so, we must speak in terms of a relation to the
whole. This relation to the whole becomes the determination which
conditions the form of objectivity of each object, and every relevant
and essential change manifest itself in terms of a change in relation
to the whole and, through this, as a change in the form of
objectivity itself. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p>Marx made this point in many places. Let me cite only one of the
best known texts:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;A Negro is a Negro, but only under certain
conditions does he become a slave. A machine to weave cotton is a
machine to weave cotton; but only under certain conditions is it
Capital. Separated from these conditions, it is as little capital as
gold is, in itself, money or sugar is the price of sugar.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Consequently, the forms of objectivity of all social phenomena
change constantly. The intelligibility of an object develops in terms
of the object&rsquo;s function in the whole, and only the conception
of totality makes it possible for us to comprehend this <em>reality as
a social process</em>. It is only in this context that the fetishistic
forms necessarily engendered by capitalism dissolve and become the
more appearances which they are (even though they are necessary
appearances). Thus, the reflexive relation of fetishistic forms,
their &ldquo;conformity to law,&rdquo; develops necessarily within
capitalist society and conceals the real relation between objects.
These relations we now understand as the necessary representation of
the object made by those who participate in capitalist production.
They are, then, an object of understanding, but known only under
fetishistic forms; they reveal, not the capitalist order itself, but
the ideology of the dominant class.</p>

<p>Only when this veil of fetishistic categories has been ripped
aside can one come to historical understanding. For the function of
these fetishistic forms is to make capitalist society appear as
super-historic, and a real knowledge of the objective character of
phenomenon, a knowledge of their historic character and actual
function in the totality of society, forms an undivided act of the
understanding. But the pseudo-scientific method shatters this unity.
Thus, the distinction between constant and variable capital, crucial
for economics, became possible through the dialectic method.
Classical economics was unable to go beyond the distinction between
fixed and circulating capital. This was not accidental. For</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;variable capital is nothing but a particular form
of the historic appearance of the means of subsistence, that is of
the labor which the worker requires for his maintenance and
reproduction and which he must produce and reproduce in all systems
of social production. This labor is only returned to the worker under
the form of payment for his work, while his own product is always
alienated from him under the form of capital ... The commodity form
of the product and the money form of the sale hid this transaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, the fetishistic forms hide relationships, they envelop all
of capitalist phenomena so as to mask their transitory, historic
character. This is possible because the forms of objectivity under
which capitalist society necessarily and immediately appears to the
man living in it to conceal economic categories, their own essence as
a form of objectivity, the fact that it is a category expressing
<em>relations</em> between men. Consequently, the forms of objectivity
appear as things and as relations between thing. And at the same time
that the dialectic unmasks the eternal appearance of these
categories, it also reveals their &ldquo;reified&rdquo; character in
order to open up the way to a knowledge of reality. Economics, writes
Engels in his <em>Commentary on the </em><em><strong>Critique of Political
Economy</strong></em>, &ldquo;does not treat of things, but of the
relations between persons and, in the last instances, between
classes; but these relations are always <em>bound to things and appear
as things</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is in this context that the total character of the dialectic
method manifests itself as a knowledge of the reality of historic
process. It might seem that this dialectic relation of part to whole
is a simple reflexive determination in which the actual categories of
social reality are no more present than in bourgeois economics. It
might seem that the superiority of dialectics over bourgeois
economics is only methodological. But the real difference is more
profound, it is a matter of principle. Each economic category reveals
a determined relation between men at a specific level of historic
evolution, a relation which is made conscious and developed as an
idea. Consequently, the movement of human society itself can be known
in its inner meaning as the product of men themselves, as the result
of forces which emerge out of their relations and escape their
control. The categories of economics then become dialectic and
dynamic in a double sense. They are in a vital interaction with one
another as &ldquo;purely economic&rdquo; categories and aid us to
understand various sections of social evolution. But also, since they
have their origins in human relations, since they function in the
process of the transformation of human relations, they lay bare the
process of evolution in the reciprocal action which they themselves
have with the actual substratum of their operation.</p>

<p>This is to say that the production and reproduction of a specific
economic totality which science must understand necessarily
transforms itself in the course of the production and reproduction of
a given, whole society (transcending &ldquo;pure&rdquo; economics,
but without invoking any transcendental force). Marx often insisted
upon this point. For example:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The capitalist process of production considered in
its continuity, or as a process of reproduction, does not only
produce merchandise, or even surplus value; it produces and
reproduces the social relation between capitalist and employee.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">TO POSE ONE&rsquo;S SELF, TO PRODUCE and reproduce one&rsquo;s
self &ndash; this is, precisely, what <em>reality</em> consists of.
Hegel recognized this, expressing it almost as Marx did, but
abstractly, in a way that could lead to misunderstanding. &ldquo;That
which is real is necessary in itself,&rdquo; he wrote in the
<strong>Philosophy of Right</strong>. &ldquo;Necessity here means that the
totality is divided into the distinctions of concepts, and that this
division reveals a solid, resistant determination (<em>bestimmtheit</em>)
and not a deadly solidity; it reveals that which continually
reconstitutes itself in the midst of dissolution.&rdquo; But here,
even as we remark the closeness of historical materialism and Hegel&rsquo;s
philosophy &ndash; both conceiving theory as the self-knowledge of
reality &ndash; we must be concerned with the decisive difference
between the two theories. This is found in the treatment of the
problem of reality and of the unity of the historic process.</p>

<p>Marx reproached Hegel (and even more his successors who turned
back to Fichte and Kant) for not having really surmounted the duality
of thought and being, of theory and practice, of subject and object.
He argued that Hegel had not gone beyond Kant on this decisive point,
that his dialectic was a simple appearance and not the actual,
interior dialectic of the historic process. He held that Hegel&rsquo;s
knowledge of matter was <em>in the subject</em> and not the
self-acknowledgment of matter, as in society. &ldquo;Already in
Hegel&rsquo;s case,&rdquo; the crucial section of his critique notes,
&ldquo;the absolute spirit has its content in the masses, but its
expression is restricted to philosophy. This is why philosophy seems
to be the organ through which the absolute spirit makes history,
emerging into consciousness after the unfolding of the movement,
after the fact. The participation of philosophy in history is thus
limited to a consciousness after the event, for the absolute spirit
accomplishes the real movement unconsciously. Thus, philosophy comes
&ldquo;<em>post festum</em>&rdquo; Thus, Hegel does not allow the
&ldquo;absolute spirit,&rdquo; as absolute spirit, to make history,
except in appearance For in effect, the absolute spirit does not
become conscious of itself as creator of the world until after the
event, and its making of history only exists in the consciousness, in
the opinion and representation of the philosophers, in the
speculative imagination&rdquo; This conceptual mythology was
definitively eliminated by the critical activity of the young Marx.</p>

<p>It is not accidental that Marx arrived at his own view in the
course of opposing a movement which was already recoiling from Hegel,
which was going back to Kant. This movement seized upon all of the
obscurities and internal ambiguities of Hegel in order to eliminate
all the revolutionary elements from his thought; it harmonized the
vestiges of the contemplative duality of thought and being, the
conceptual mythology, with the completely reactionary philosophy of
Germany at that time. By becoming a partisan of the progressive in
the Hegelian method, Marx not only separated himself from these
successors of Hegel &ndash; he created a schism in the Hegelian
philosophy itself. For Marx took the historic tendency which he found
in Hegel to its limits. He transformed all social phenomena, all
aspects of social man, into historic problems, he showed the real
substratum of historic evolution and developed a fertile method in
the doing.</p>

<p>Marx applied the measure which he had discovered and methodically
developed to the Hegelian philosophy, and he found it wanting.
Indeed, the myth-making vestiges of &ldquo;eternal values&rdquo;
which he eliminated from the dialectic were similar to the
philosophic elements which Hegel himself fought ceaselessly
throughout his life, and against which he had marshalled his entire
philosophic method, with its process and concrete reality, its
dialectic and history. In this context, the Marxist critique of Hegel
is thus the direct continuation of Hegel&rsquo;s own critique of Kant
and Fichte. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p>Thus, the dialectic method of Marx is the continuation of that
which Hegel sought but did not attain. While, on the other hand, the
dead body of the Hegelian texts has become the prey of the
philologists and makers of systems.</p>

<p>But the point of rupture between Marx and Hegel is the question of
reality. Hegel was unable to see the real motor force of history. In
part, this was the case because these forces were not sufficiently
visible during the period of the genesis of his philosophy.
Consequently, he did not recognize that the people and their
consciousness were the effective bearers of historic development; he
did not see the real substratum, in all its variousness, but instead
put forward the mythology of the &ldquo;Spirit of the people.&rdquo;
Yet Hegel failed for another reason: that, despite all his tremendous
efforts to the contrary, he remained caught in Platonic and Kantian
forms of thought continuing the duality of thought and being, of form
and matter. Even though he was the discoverer of the significance of
the concrete reality, even though he sought to go beyond all
abstractions, matter nevertheless remained for him (and in this, he
was quite Platonic) sullied by the &ldquo;stain of being specific&rdquo;
(<em>makel der bestimmtheit</em>).</p>

<p>Because of these contradictory tendencies, Hegel was unable to
clarify his own system. Often, he juxtaposes contraries without
mediation, they are presented contradictorily and without any
possibility of internal reciprocity. And consequently, his system
looks to the past as much as toward the future. <A HREF="#n8" NAME="f8">[8]</a>
It is thus hardly surprising that bourgeois science very early
borrowed from Hegel. And were it not for the Marxists, the very core
of Hegel&rsquo;s thought, its revolutionary content, would have been
obscured.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">CONCEPTUAL MYTHOLOGIES ALWAYS signify that some fundamental fact
of man&rsquo;s existence has eluded him, a fact so basic that is
consequences cannot be repressed. This inability to penetrate the
object then results in an appeal to transcendental motor forces which
construct and structure reality, the relations between objects, our
relations with them and the modification of the historic process, in
a mythological fashion. The recognition that &ldquo;the production
and reproduction of real life is, in the last instant, the
determining element in history,&rdquo; meant that Marx and Engels
had, for the first time, found the possibility of liquidating all
mythology, that they had reached solid ground for the accomplishment
of this task. The absolute spirit of Hegel was thus the last of those
grandiose mythological forms in which the totality and its movement
expressed itself in a way that was unconscious of its true essence.
Thus, that reason &ldquo;which had always existed, but not always
under a reasonable form&rdquo; achieved its &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;
form in historical materialism through the discovery of its basic
substratum. And the program of the Hegelian philosophy of history was
achieved through the destruction of Hegelianism. For in opposition to
nature in which, as Hegel emphasizes, &ldquo;change is circular, a
repetition,&rdquo; change in history is not simply produced &ldquo;on
the surface, but in the concept.&rdquo; And the concept itself is
corrected by the change of history.</p>

<p>Only in this context can the viewpoint of dialectic materialism
(&ldquo;that it is not the consciousness of men which determines
their being, but on the contrary, their social being which determines
their consciousness&rdquo;) pass beyond the purely theoretical and
pose the problem of &ldquo;praxis.&rdquo; For its is only when the
core (<em>kern</em>) of being is revealed as social process that being
appears as the product, in the past unconscious, of human activity,
and this activity is seen as the decisive element in the
transformation of being. Purely natural relations, or social forms
mystified into natural relations, oppose themselves to man. They seem
to be fixed, achieved, unchangeable and given, an essence which can
be known but not transformed. And such a conception places the
possibility of &ldquo;praxis&rdquo; in the individual consciousness.
&ldquo;Praxis&rdquo; becomes a form of activity of the isolated
individual, an ethic. The attempt of Feuerbach to go beyond Hegel
came to grief on this very point: he did not go beyond the isolated
individual of &ldquo;bourgeois society&rdquo; and in this he was at
one with German idealism and Hegel himself.</p>

<p>Marx demanded that we understand &ldquo;sensuousness,&rdquo; the
object, the reality and the sensuous human activity. This implied
that man had reached a consciousness of himself as a social being,
simultaneously conceived as the subject and object of the
historic-social becoming. Feudal man could not achieve a
consciousness of himself as a social being since his social relations
themselves had a natural character &ndash; society itself was so
little organized, it was so little a unity of the totality of human
relations, that it could not appear to consciousness as <em>the</em>
human reality. (The question of the structure and unity of feudal
society cannot be taken up here.) Bourgeois society accomplished the
socialization of society. Capitalism destroyed all spatial and
temporal barriers between the different countries and places, as it
shattered the juridical wall of separation which maintained the
stability of &ldquo;estates.&rdquo; In a universe of formal equality
among men, the economic relations which ruled the immediate material
exchange between man and nature disappeared. Man became &ndash; in
the true sense of the world &ndash; a social being, society became
<em>the</em> reality for man.</p>

<p>Thus, it is only on the terrain of capitalism, of bourgeois
society, that it is possible to recognize society as reality. However
the bourgeoisie, the class which was the historic agent of this
revolution, accomplished its function without consciousness. The very
social forces which it liberated, which it brought to power, seemed
to the bourgeoisie to be a second nature, more soulless and
impenetrable than that of feudalism. It is only with the appearance
of the proletariat that the consciousness of the social reality finds
its achievement. And this is because the point of view of the
proletariat is one from which the totality of society becomes
visible. Consequently as the doctrine of historical materialism
emerged it was both the &ldquo;condition for the liberation of the
proletariat,&rdquo; and the doctrine of the reality of the total
process of historic development. This was true precisely because it
was a matter of vital need, a question of life or death, for the
proletariat to attain a perfectly clear vision of its situation as a
class. This knowledge was only comprehensible in terms of the
knowledge of the totality of society, and the resultant consciousness
was the inevitable precondition of proletarian action. The unity of
theory and &ldquo;praxis&rdquo; is, then, only the other face of the
historic social situation of the proletariat, a situation which makes
self-knowledge and knowledge of the totality coincide. Thus, the
proletariat is both the subject and object of its proper knowledge.</p>

<p>For the vocation of leading humanity to a higher level of
development requires, as Hegel rightly remarked (though he applied
his insight to &ldquo;peoples&rdquo;), the fact that &ldquo;these
stages of evolution present themselves as immediate, natural
principles,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the people&rdquo; (that is, the
class) &ldquo;who receive such an element as a natural principle have
the mission of applying it.&rdquo; Marx concretized this idea with a
clarity that extends to all of social evolution: &ldquo;when
socialist writers attribute a world-historical role to the
proletariat, it is not because they consider the proletarian
god-like. Far from it. Because the abstraction of humanity from
itself is achieved in the fully-formed proletariat; because the
paroxysms of the most inhuman of all the conditions of life are
subsumed in the life of the proletariat; because in this existence,
man is not only lost but theoretically conscious of this fact and is
impelled by the imperious, unavoidable and immediate misery &ndash;
the practical expression of this necessity &ndash; to revolt against
this inhumanity; because of this the proletariat can and must
necessarily liberate itself. But it cannot liberate itself without
surpassing its proper conditions of life. And it cannot end its
proper conditions of life without ending all the inhuman conditions
of the society around it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus, the methodological essence of historical materialism cannot
be separated from the &ldquo;practical-critical activity&rdquo; of
the proletariat. The two are aspects of the same evolutionary process
of society. Consequently, the knowledge of reality which is at the
center of the dialectic cannot be separated from the point of view of
the proletariat. To raise, as the &ldquo;Austro- Marxists&rdquo; do,
the question of methodologically separating the pure science of
Marxism from its socialism is to pose a false problem. For the
Marxist method, the dialectical materialist knowledge of reality is
only possible from the class point of view, from the vantage point of
class struggle. To abandon this point of view is to leave just as to
reach this point of view is to enter directly into the struggle of
the proletariat.</p>

<p>Historical materialism thus emerges as a vital, &ldquo;immediate,
natural&rdquo; principle of the proletariat, and the total knowledge
of reality is made possible by this class point of view. But this
does not mean that this knowledge, and the methodology behind it, is
innate or natural to the proletariat as a class (and even less so to
the proletarian individual). On the contrary. Certainly the
proletariat is the knowing subject, but not in the Kantian sense
where the subject is defined as that which can never become an
object. The proletariat is not an impartial spectator of the historic
process. It is not merely a partisan, active and passive, part of the
whole. The increase and development of its knowledge, on the one
hand, and its increase and development as a class in the course of
history on the other, are but two sides of the same real process.
This is not simply because the class itself does not become &ldquo;formed
into a class&rdquo; except through incessant struggle beginning with
the spontaneous desperation of immediate acts (the destruction of
machines is a simple example of these beginnings). More than that,
the consciousness of social reality achieved by the proletariat, its
understanding of its proper position as a class and its historic
vocation &ndash; the method of the materialist conception of history
&ndash; are also the products of this same process of evolution which
historical materialism comprehends adequately and in its reality for
the first time in history.</p>

<p>In this context, the revisionist separation of the movement from
the final goal represents a retrogression to a primitive level of the
worker&rsquo;s movement. The final goal is not a state which awaits
the proletariat at the end of a process, it is not independent of the
process and of the path which it takes, it is not a &ldquo;state of
the future.&rdquo; Consequently, one cannot forget the final goal
during the course of daily struggle and remember it only as an ideal
which is stated in a Sunday sermon. It is not a &ldquo;duty,&rdquo;
not an idea which plays a regulative role in the &ldquo;real&rdquo;
process. The final goal is precisely <em>the relation to the totality</em>
(to the totality of society considered as a historic process) through
which, and only through which, each moment of struggle acquires its
revolutionary content. It takes the daily struggle from a level of
facility, of simpleness, to that of reality. Therefore, one must
never forget that every effort to preserve the &ldquo;final goal,&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;essence of the proletariat, in a state of purity while
the sordid re- [some text appears to be missing here] -ation with the
existence takes place ends up by making the comprehension of reality
more distant. And then, the &ldquo;critical-practical&rdquo; activity
falls back into a utopian duality of subject and object, of theory
and &ldquo;praxis&rdquo; just as surely as revisonism itself leads to
this pass.</p>

<p>The practical danger of all dualistic conceptions of this type is
that they spirit away the very element which gives action its
direction. For as soon as one goes to the &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
terrain of existence, to the pure, simple and vulgar &ldquo;empirical&rdquo;
&ndash; as soon as one abandons the terrain of reality where
dialectical materialism conquers and reconquers &ndash; then the
subject of the action is opposed to the milieu of &ldquo;facts&rdquo;
in which the action must develop. There is no mediation between the
subject and the fact, they are two separate principles. And it is as
little possible to impose the will, the product of subjective
decision, upon the objective facts as it is to discover a direction
for action in the facts themselves. For a situation in which the
&ldquo;facts&rdquo; speak unamibiguously for or against a specific
action has never existed, cannot exist, and will never exist. The
more the facts are taken in their isolation (that is, in their
reflexive relation), the less are they able to point toward a
specific orientation. And it is obvious that the power of unmastered
facts which automatically act &ldquo;according to plan&rdquo; will
shatter the subjective decision.</p>

<p>Thus, the fashion in which the dialectic method approaches reality
reveals itself precisely when one turns to the problem of action, for
it alone is capable of orienting action. The self-consciousness of
the proletariat, both objective and subjective, at a given moment of
its evolution is, at the same time, an understanding of the level
which the epoch has attained in social evolution. The facts are no
longer &ldquo;strange&rdquo; when they are seen in the coherence of
the real, in the rootedness of each particular moment in the totality
(a rootedness which is immanent, and not simply revealed). And thus
the tendencies which drive reality become visible &ndash; or, in
other words, the final goal becomes visible.</p>

<p>The final goal is not, therefore, counterposed to the process as
an abstract ideal. It is, on the contrary, the very sense of the
process which is immanent at a given stage, and the comprehension of
it is precisely a knowledge of the (unconscious) tendencies which
lead toward totality. As a result, the orientation of a specific
action is made in terms of the interest of the entire process, of the
liberation of the proletariat.</p>

<p>Yet, the social evolution cease[less]ly develops a tension between
the partial moment and the totality. Precisely because the immanent
sense of reality radiates with increasing sharpness, the sense of
process becomes ever more immanent in the daily action, totality
permeates the momentary, spatial-temporal character of phenomenon.
But the way of consciousness does not become easier in the course of
the historic process. On the contrary, it always becomes more arduous
and demands greater and greater responsibility. This is why the
function of orthodox Marxism, its going beyond revisionism and
utopia, is not a final liquidation of these false tendencies, but a
ceaseless, ever-renewed struggle against the perverting influence of
bourgeois ideology in proletarian thought. This orthodoxy is not the
guardian of tradition, but rather the herald which must always
proclaim the relation between the instant and its tactics to the
totality of the historic process. And thus, the words of the
Communist Manifesto on the tasks of orthodoxy and of its partisans
are not outdated, but always remain crucial: &ldquo;The Communist
differentiate themselves from other proletarian parties on two
points: on the one hand, that in the various struggles of the workers
they place in the fore and defend the interests which are common to
the proletariat and independent of nationality; and on the other
hand, that in the various phases of the struggle between the
proletariat and the bourgeoisie, they constantly represent the
interest of the total movement.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> K. Marx, <strong>Contribution to the
Critique of Political Economy</strong>. This limitation of the method to
the historical and social reality is extremely important. The
misunderstandings which Engels&rsquo; treatment of the matter have
produced developed because Engels &ndash; following Hegel &ndash;
understood the dialectic as applying to the understanding of nature.
But the decisive determinations of the dialectic &ndash; the
reciprocal action of object and subject, the unity of theory and
&ldquo;praxis,&rdquo; the historic modification of the substratum of
categories as the foundation of modifications in thought, etc. &ndash;
are not found in the natural sciences. Unfortunately, this is not the
place to discuss this question in detail.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f2" name="n2">2.</a> <em>Introduction</em> to the <strong>Class
Struggles in France</strong>. But one should not forget that exactness in
the natural sciences presupposes precisely this &ldquo;constancy&rdquo;
of elements. This methodological exigency has already been posed by
Galileo.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f3" name="n3">3.</a> <strong>Capital</strong>, III, 1. This
distinction (which is analyzed into the dialectical moments of
appearance, manifestation and reality) comes from Hegel&rsquo;s
<strong>Logic</strong>. Unfortunately, we eannot develop here how basic this
distinction is to the ideas of The <strong>Capital</strong>. The distinction
between representation and concept also comes from Hegel.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f4" name="n4">4.</a> <strong>Contribution to the Critique of
Political Economy</strong>. The category of the reflexive connection also
comes from Hegel&rsquo;s <strong>Logic</strong>.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f5" name="n5">5.</a> For those readers who are
particularly interested in this methodological point, It should be
noted that in Hegel&rsquo;s logic the relation between the whole and
the parts constitutes the dialectic passage from existence to
reality. And it should be emphasized that the problem which we have
discussed, that of the relation between the interior and the
exterior, is for Hegel also a problem of totality.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f6" name="n6">6.</a> The particularly refined
opportunism of Cunow reveals itself in that he changes the concept of
the whole (of the ensemble, of the totality) into that of the sum,
thus suppressing all dialectic relation, and that he does this
despite his well-rounded knowledge of the Marxist texts. See his
<strong>Marxist Theory of History, Society and the State</strong>.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f7" name="n7">7.</a> It is not surprising that Cunow
attempts to correct Marx by reference to a Kant-oriented Hegel on the
very point where Marx surpassed Hegel radically. He opposes the
Hegelian state (as an eternal value) to the purely historic
conception of the state in Marx, and claims that the &ldquo;faults&rdquo;
of the Hegelian state &ndash; its function as an instrument of class
oppression &ndash; are only &ldquo;historic things&rdquo; and do not
determine its essence and direction.</p>

<p class="note">For Cunow, Marx is here a retrogression from Hegel because he
considers the question &ldquo;from a political, and not a
sociological, point of view.&rdquo; Thus, there is no such thing as
going beyond Hegel for the opportunists. If they do not go back to
the vulgar materialism of Kant, then they use the reactionary content
of the Hegelian philosophy of the state in order to eliminate the
revolutionary dialectic of Marxism and thus eternalize bourgeois
society.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f8" name="n8">8.</a> The position of Hegel <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em>
the national economy is quite characteristic of this fact (cf.
<strong>Philosophy of Right</strong>). He recognizes clearly that the
fundamental methodological problem is that of contingency and
necessity (as, in a way, Engels did), but be is unable to comprehend
the fundamental meaning of the material substratum of the economy,
the relation of men to each other. This remains for him a &ldquo;swarm
of anarchic wills,&rdquo; and laws resembles a &ldquo;planetary
system.&rdquo;</p>
