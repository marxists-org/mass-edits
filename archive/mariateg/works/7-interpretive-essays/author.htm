<h1>Seven Interpretative Essays on Peruvian Reality</h1>

<h3>Author&#8217;s Note</h3>
<hr /> 

 

<p>I bring together in this book, organized and annotated in seven essays, the articles that I published in Mundial and Amanta concerning some essential aspects of Peruvian reality. Like La escena contempor&#225;nea, therefore, this was not conceived of as a book. Better this way. My work has developed as Nietzsche would have wished, for he did not love authors who strained after the intentional, deliberate production of a book, but rather those whose thoughts formed a book spontaneously and without premeditation. Many projects for books occur to me as I lie awake, but I know beforehand that I shall carry out only those to which I am summoned by an imperious force. My thought and my life are one process. And if I hope to have some merit recognized, it is that&#8212;following another of Nietzsche&#8217;s precepts &#8212;I have written with my blood.</p>

<p>I intended to include in this collection an essay on the political and ideological evolution of Peru. But as I advance in it, I realize that I must develop it separately in another book. I find that the seven essays are already too long, so much so that they do not permit me to complete other work as I would like to and ought to; nevertheless, they should be published before my new study appears. In this way, my reading public will already be familiar with the materials and ideas of my political and ideological views.</p>

<p>I shall return to these topics as often as shall be indicated by the course of my research and arguments. Perhaps in each of these essays there is the outline, the plan, of an independent book. None is finished; they never will be as long as I live and think and have something to add to what I have written, lived, and thought.</p>

<p>All this work is but a contribution to Socialist criticism of the problems and history of Peru. There are many who think that I am tied to European culture and alien to the facts and issues of my country. Let my book defend me against this cheap and biased assumption. I have served my best apprenticeship in Europe and I believe the only salvation for Indo-America lies in European and Western science and thought. Sarmiento, who is still one of the creators of <em>argentinidad</em>  [Argentine-ness], at one one time turned his eyes toward Europe. He found no better way to be an Argentine.</p>

<p>Once again I repeat that I am not an impartial, objective critic. My judgments are nourished by my ideals, my sentiments, my passions. I have an avowed and resolute ambition: to assist in the creation of Peruvian socialism. I am far removed from the academic techniques of the university.</p>

<p>This is all that I feel honestly bound to tell the reader before he begins my book.</p>
