<p class="fst">Author&#8217;s Notes:

<P>Lenin was born in Simbirsk, in 1876, the son of a primary school director.
He studied law in Petrograd, where his brother Alexander -- who was executed
following an attempt on the life of Alexander III -- introduced him to
&#8220;Capital.&#8221; He joined the socialist movement and gave himself completely
to the workers&#8217; cause. He turned not only to the study of theories but,
mainly, to the direct study of the worker&#8217;s problems and spirit. He was
an organizer from his time as a student. Eventually, they threw him out
of the University. Following a textile strike, he was sent to Siberia.
There, he completed his theoretical studies and his practical observations
on the social issue in the world and in Russia. He has his ideology on
proletarian reality; he fought against the workers&#8217; confusion generated
by Russia&#8217;s political situation; he fought to differentiate between the
Marxists and those who were not. He took part in the 1905 revolution next
to the workers of Moscow. In 1907 he emigrated to Finland and then abroad.
In that period he wrote his book, &#8220;Materialism and Empiriocriticism.&#8221; In
1912 he was in Krakow, encouraging the workers&#8217; movement. Then, in Switzerland.

<P>In 1907, at the Stuttgart congress, the International approved a motion
by Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg which, in its conclusion, said: &#8220; If a war
threatens to breakout, it is the duty of the working classes in the countries
involved, supported by the International, to coordinate their efforts to
prevent its break out by whatever means they consider most effective, and
which naturally vary according to the intensity of the class struggle and
the general political situation. In case war should break out, it is the
socialists&#8217; duty to intervene for its speedy termination and to strive
with all their power to utilize the economic and political crisis created
by the war to rouse the masses and thereby bring about the downfall of
the capitalist order.&#8221;

<P>Then, during the war, came the Zimmerwald and Kienthal congresses, to
which went those union and socialist fraction loyal to those principles.
There, the Third International began to germinate.

<P>Lenin&#8217;s role in the Russian revolution.

<P>His books: &#8220;The State and Revolution,&#8221; &#8220;Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile
Disorder,&#8221; &#8220;The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky,&#8221; &#8220;The
Fight for Bread,&#8221; &#8220;The Soviet&#8217;s Work of Rebuilding,&#8221; &#8220;Critical Notes on
a Reactionary Philosophy,&#8221; and others.*

<P>His collaboration in Pravda, Izvestia, and the Journal of the III International.

<P>Sorel&#8217;s &#8220;Defense of Lenin&#8221; pages in his book &#8220;Reflections on Violence.&#8221;

<P>__________
<P>* In the Spanish-language original the titles of the latter three of
these works by Lenin are given as: &#8220;La lucha por el pan,&#8221; &#8220;La obra de reconstrucci&oacute;n
de los soviets,&#8221; and &#8220;Apuntes cr&iacute;ticos sobre una filosof&iacute;a
reaccionaria.&#8221; These, evidently, are the titles under which they circulated
in Peru at the time, and may even be Mari&aacute;tegui&#8217;s translation of
titles originally in Italian. We have not been able to determine which
English titles they might correspond to in Progress Publishers&#8217; &#8220;V. I.
