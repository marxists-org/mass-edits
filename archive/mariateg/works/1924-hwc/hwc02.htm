<p class="fst">Author&#8217;s Notes:

<P>War literature. The press, martial instrument. Its toxic function. Its
quality of capitalist instrument. Its lack of high moral directions. The
myth of Civilization&#8217;s against Barbarism. &#8220;The novel ends; history begins,&#8221;
said Bernard Shaw. In tempo di guerra pi&uacute; bugie che terra.

<P>Economic causes of the war: development of British industrialism and
the development of German industrialism. The economic war between England
and Germany. The struggle for markets, for colonies. Effects of protectionism
in the European countries&#8217; economies. The role of international finance.
Capitalist groups&#8217; rivalries. Then, how a policy of economic co-operation
and solidarity could have avoided the catastrophe. Demography has an important
place in the origins of the war. Adrian Tilgher&#8217;s words: page 106 of &#8220;The
World Crisis.&#8221; In one century the European population went from 180 to
450 millions. Industrialism stimulated population growth. Reduction in
the three causes of depopulation: plague, hunger, war. Germany, cut-off,
could not feed 70 million inhabitants. Italy could not remain neutral.

<P>Political causes: The process of the war&#8217;s causes, according to Bernard
Shaw. The traditional policy and position of England, an island power.
The development of Germany&#8217;s naval power. England, France, and Belgium
have and understanding. The Franco-Russian alliance. Anglo-French secret
military intelligence. The violation of Belgian neutrality saved England
from embarrassment. But there is information and antecedents which establish
the type of agreement which exists between England and France. If England
had truly wished to avoid the war, says Shaw, it would have needed only
to announce that it would fight alongside the nation which was attacked.
The hypothesis of a noose, of a trap. More believable is the hypothesis
of the impossibility of the English government&#8217;s revealing its military
agreement with France. Thus, from this point of view, the war turns out
to be a consequence of French diplomacy.

<P>Another cause: French revanchism, German Deuschland uber alles. European
nationalism, in short. Psychology of the French petty bourgeoisie and of
the German bureaucracy. Germany felt dispossessed next to the privileged
nations. Poincar&eacute;. The Kaiser. The Tsar. Lloyd George&#8217;s words in
the British Parliament; page 39 of Cailleaux&#8217;s book.

<P>Another cause: armed peace. The powers&#8217; balance. There existed in Europe
a flammable atmosphere.

<P>The diplomatic cause: the assassination of the Austrian heir. The war
could have broken out earlier. In the instance of the Russo-Japanese War
and of the Agadir incident of 1912. Words from Viviani to Rapoport: page
33 of the latter&#8217;s book.

<P>Contrast of capitalist organization. It needs international solidarity
as a condition of life and promotes nationalism in opposition to class
struggle. How a people is moved to war. The novel, &#8220;Clart&eacute;.&#8221;

<P>Absolute war and relative war. War of nations and war of armies. The
myth of democratic war. The direction of public opinion in England, in
Italy, Austria, and Russia, insofar as there was no ideal which could unite
the people behind their respective governments&#8217; military enterprises.

<P>The behavior of the socialist parties and of the syndicalist organizations.
The Second International&#8217;s position. The Stuttgart and Basle declarations.
The technical issue of how to avoid the war was left to the Vienna Congress
which was to meet in 1914. Before then, the war arrived. M&uuml;ller&#8217;s
mission in France. The death of Jaur&egrave;. Gustave Herv&eacute;&#8217;s case.

<P>Above the conflict. The manifesto of 93 German intellectuals. The countermanifesto
by Nicolai, the physiologist, by Einstein, the physicist, by Buek, the
philosopher, by Foerster, the astronomer -- the latter surprised by the
93 intellectuals. Romain Rolland.

<P>Let the proletariat meditate over the causes of this great tragedy.
Let it think about how a few men and few interests have been able to unleash
a war which has caused fifteen million deaths, which sown Europe with hatreds,
which has destroyed so much economic wealth, and which has deleteriously
poisoned the moral atmosphere of Europe. And, let the proletariat tell
itself if it is worthwhile to rebuild capitalist society, bourgeois society,
so that in forty or fifty years, perhaps sooner, the world will again be
lit up in another conflagration and another butchery take place.
