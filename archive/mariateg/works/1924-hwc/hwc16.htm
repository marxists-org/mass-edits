<P>&#8220;The Mexican Revolution - Lecture by Jos&eacute; Carlos Mari&aacute;tegui&#8221;

<P>Before a numerous audience Jos&eacute; Carlos Mari&aacute;tegui delivered
his antepenultimate lecture about the history of the world crisis. The
course program assigned to the lecture a topic of exceptional interest
in the current moments: The Mexican Revolution. In the course program,
the Mexican Revolution is, naturally, not the current civil war between
General Obreg&oacute;n&#8217;s government and the De la Huerta faction, but rather
the whole transcendental revolutionary period begun with the overthrow
of Porfirio D&iacute;az's dictatorship by Francisco Madero.

<P>Mari&aacute;tegui expounded on the Mexican Revolution&#8217;s origins. He
explained the agrarian question&#8217;s substantive importance in the latest
events in the history of Mexico. He also dealt with the social and economic
aspects of the Revolution.

<P>He gave the history of Madero&#8217;s movement, the weaknesses and transactions
which undermined the government of this generous caudillo, the reactionary
activity which engendered Huerta&#8217;s coup, Madero's murder. He then moved
on to examine the events which led General Venustiano Carranza to power.
He also dealt with the 1917 Constitution, illustrating, above all, its
Articles 27 and 123.

<P>He then spoke about Obreg&oacute;n&#8217;s regime and the agrarian reform.
He later dedicated much of his lecture to expounding on the educational
work of Jos&eacute; Vasconcelos, his revolutionary ideology, his high and
pure idealism.

<P>Lastly, he expounded on the various aspects of Mexico&#8217;s social and proletarian
movement, and concluded by inviting the workers to greet, in the Mexican
Revolution, the first light of the transformation on Hispano-American world.

<P>The audience gave Mari&aacute;tegui a long applause, and, at the initiative
of the student, Luis F. Bustamante, agreed to invite the organized proletariat
to sign a message of greeting to Vasconcelos and entrust its delivery to
V&iacute;ctor Ra&uacute;l Haya de la Torre. The worker, Carbajo, read a
letter from Haya de la Torre communicating his first impressions of his
stay in Mexico, which was greeted with great applause.
