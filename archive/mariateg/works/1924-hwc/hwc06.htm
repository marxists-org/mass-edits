	<P class="fst">The subject of tonight's lecture is the German Revolution.</P>
	<P>In the preceding lectures I have explained the main aspects
	of the German Revolution's process of generation, of
	incubation.</P>

	<P>I have stated already that the war was not popular in
	Germany, that the German government carried out the war with
	the old criterion of relative war, of military war, of not
	total war; that the German government was unable to create any
	popular myth capable of ensuring it the solid support of the
	popular classes; and, that the war was presented to the German
	people solely as a war of national defense.  While the German
	government kept alive the hope of victory, while no military
	failures discredited its adventure, while it was able to keep
	the populace from hunger and privations, it succeeded in that
	public opinion withstand the war without rebellion.  But, it
	did not manage to excite the people toward its imperialist
	ideals.  The war was not popular with the proletariat.  The
	intellectuals, the German intelligentsia, in their majority,
	placed themselves at the service of the war, of aggression,
	and created a cynical, ranting war literature.</P>

	<P>The German poets chanted war and denigrated peace.  Thomas
	Mann wrote, " Man is spoiled in peace.  Slothful repose is the
	heart's tomb.  The law is the friend of the weak; she wishes
	to level everything; if she could she would flatten the world;
	but war makes strength emerge."</P>

	<P>Heinrich Vierordt wrote his <I>Deutchland, Hasse</I>
	(<I>Germany, Hate</I>).   Professor Oswald wrote, "Germany
	wishes to organize Europe, since Europe has, to now, never
	been organized."</P>

	<P>Finally, the famous 93 German intellectuals signed that
	notorious manifesto servilely sponsoring and defending the
	German war.  But, all this bellicose literature
	notwithstanding, only the bourgeoisie and the petty
	bourgeoisie were delirious with nationalism.  The proletariat
	declared that its support for the war was not from conviction,
	but duty.  The proletariat never subscribed to the bourgeois
	and petty bourgeois intellectuals' cynical ideas.</P>

	<P>What is more, almost from the first instant, as soon as the
	period of intoxication and confusion from the declaration of
	war had passed, some honest and brave voices of protest were
	raised in Germany.</P>

	<P>Four German wisemen took a position against the
	ninety-three intellectuals of the manifesto, and published
	their own counter-manifesto.  I have already spoken to you of
	these four wisemen, who were the physicist, Einstein, the
	physiologist, Nicolai, the philosopher, Buek, and the
	astronomer, Foerster.  The poet, Herman Hesse -like Romain
	Rolland, in asylum in Switzerland- wrote an ode to peace and a
	call to Europe's thinkers to rescue what little of peace could
	still be saved and to not themselves, with their pens, pillage
	Europe's future.  The journal, <I>Die Wiessen Blaetter</I>,
	was a home to German intellectuals loyal to the cause of
	Europe's, and Western civilization's, moral unity.  And,
	various leaders of the proletariat -Karl Liebknecht, Rosa
	Luxemburg, Kurt Eisner, Franz Mehring, Leo Jogiches, and
	others- reacted against the war and denounced its imperialist
	and counter-revolutionary goal.  Karl Liebknecht was one of
	the fourteen deputies opposed to war credits on August 4; but
	these fourteen deputies did not vote against war credits in
	Parliament, but in the heart of the socialist group in
	parliament.</P>

	<P>The great majority of the group agreed to vote for the
	credits.  The fourteen deputies in the minority, Karl
	Liebknecht among them, resolved to submit to the majority's
	decision.   However, Karl Liebknecht soon felt the necessity
	of rescuing his own and personal responsibility as a leader
	and as a socialist intellectual.  In December of 1914 he voted
	against the new war credits, without paying attention to the
	will of the socialist parliamentary group.</P>

	<P>Of course, inside and outside of the Reichstag, of the
	German parliament, a tempest was unleashed against Karl
	Liebknecht.  In January of 1915 Karl Liebnecht was drafted
	into the army.   He was sent to Kustrin.  Liebknecht refused
	to accept a gun.  He was then transferred to a company of
	laborers, of suspects, in Lorraine.  Later he was sent to the
	Russian front.  From the front, Karl Liebknecht wrote to his
	children on December 21, "I will not shoot."   He still
	attended other sessions of the Reichstag, where he again spoke
	out on several occasions against the German government and
	against the war.  The clamor of the Chamber invariably
	covered, overwhelmed, and drowned out his solitary and heroic
	voice.  But Karl Liebknecht did not renounce his propaganda,
	and together with Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, Clara Zetkin,
	he wrote those famous letters signed with the pseudonym of
	Spartacus, which later  was the name of the German Communist
	Party.</P>

	<P>On May 1 of 1918 there took place in Berlin the first
	public demonstration against the war.  Karl Liebknecht,
	disguised as a civilian, attended.  He was arrested and tried
	for treason against the fatherland.  The military tribunal
	sentenced him to four years of forced labor.  A year later,
	the revolution opened the doors to his jail.  The figure of
	Liebknecht, as we can see, was not the only one in the leading
	ranks of the German proletariat which struggled against the
	war.</P>

	<P>At Liebknecht's side stand several glorious figures.</P>
	<P>I have already mentioned Rosa Luxemburg, Clara Zetkin,
	Eugen Leviné.  All these leaders recognized that their duty
	was to fight against the war, as they later recognized that
	their duty was to carry the revolution through to the end.
	All of them belonged, like Karl Liebknecht, to the Spartacus
	group, the initial cell of the German Communist Party.  But, I
	shall deal with their conduct during the revolution itself in
	due time.   Right now, what is under examination is but their
	conduct during the pre-revolution, because, based on it, I
	hold that there was in the German proletarian movement a
	different attitude toward the war than in the proletarian
	movement in the allied nations.  A numerous nucleus of
	proletarian opinion -repressed militarily, it is true, by the
	government's action- struggled  to turn the German proletariat
	against the war.  And the one hundred deputies of German
	socialism, the majority of social-democracy's leaders, could
	not give the war ardorous and unconditional support.  The
	German bourgeoisie and middle class fought for the ideals of
	Prussian militarism, for world domination, for <I>Deutschland
	Uber Alles</I>, for <I>ubervolk</I>, for Europe's submission
	to German organization; but the German proletariat, in
	accordance with the marching orders from its majority leaders,
	fought but in the interest of national defense.  The German
	proletariat did not feel the absolute need for war <I>jusqu'au
	bout</I>, for war to the end, for total war, and, above all,
	until the enemy's total annihilation.</P>

	<P>Consequently, Wilson and his democratic propaganda, Wilson
	and his Fourteen Points, Wilson and his illusions of a new
	code of international justice, found a permeable front, a
	vulnerable front, a yielding front, in the German front.  I
	have already stated the revolutionary resonance which the
	Wilsonian program attained amongst the populace.  Ever since
	the Austrian people were told that the allies fought, not
	against them, but against their governments, ever since they
	were assured that they would not have imposed on them a peace
	of annexations, nor of indemnizations, the German and Austrian
	peoples began to feel ever less a need for the war.
	Furthermore, as I have also said already, the Wilsonian
	propaganda stimulated and awoke old and deep-rooted ideals of
	national independence in the nationalities locked in the
	Austro-Hungarian Empire.  </P>

	<P>On the other hand, the Russian Revolution also
	revolutionarily echoed within the Austrian proletariat and in
	the German proletariat.  Two propagandas joined to undermine
	and break through the Austro-German front: Wilson's democratic
	propaganda and the Bolsheviks' maximalist propaganda.</P>

	<P>The effects of these propagandas had to be manifest
	following the first Austro-German military defeat.   The
	Italian offensive in Piave found the Austrian army little
	disposed toward sacrifice.</P>

	<P>The Czechoslovakian troops gave up almost en masse.  And,
	on the German front, the news of this disaster and of the
	French offensive, unleashed the explosion of revolutionary
	seeds, so long accumulated.</P>

	<P>The German people and the German army made evident their
	desire for peace and capitulation.  They rose up against the
	Kaiser and the monarchy, against the regime responsible for
	the war and to blame for the defeat.  They defined the
	responsibility of the German government and that of the German
	people.  And they swept away the monarchy and all its
	institutions.</P>

	<P>November 9 of 1918, little more than a year from the
	Russian Revolution, the German Revolution took place.  The
	history of the events of those days is well known.  There
	broke out a revolutionary strike in Kiel and Hamburg.  The
	sailors rebelled and, in automobiles, marched on Berlin.  A
	general strike was declared.  The troops refused to repress
	the insurgent proletariat.  The Kaiser abdicated and left
	Berlin.  And the revolutionaries proclaimed a Republic in
	Germany.  The revolution had, at that moment, a purely
	proletarian character.</P>

	<P>Workers' and soldiers' councils -in effect, soviets- were
	created in Germany.   A cabinet of majority socialists was
	formed.   But this cabinet did not include socialism's left
	wing -the group of Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz
	Mehring, Clara Zetkin, etc.- contrary to an agreement with the
	majority socialists who had supported the war.   Moreover,
	hostilities quickly arose between the group of Karl Liebknecht
	and Rosa Luxemburg and the governing socialists.   Karl
	Liebknecht founded the Spartacus Union, the German Communist
	Party, and the Spartacists' news organ, <I>Die Rote Fahne</I>
	(<I>The Red Flag</I>).</P>

	<P>The Spartacists propounded the fulfillment of socialism
	through the dictatorship of the proletariat, through soviet
	government.  They demanded the confiscation of all Crown
	properties for the benefit of the collective; the annulment of
	state debts and war loans; the expropriation of large and
	medium agricultural properties and the formation of
	agricultural cooperatives to administer them, while small
	properties remained in the hands of their smallholders until
	they voluntarily desired to join the cooperatives; the
	nationalization of all banks, mines, factories, and large
	industrial and commercial establishments.  In sum, the
	Spartacists proposed the carrying out in Germany of the
	program carried out by the maximalists in Russia.  The
	majority socialists -Ebert, Scheidemann, etc.- were averse to
	this program.  And the masses who followed them were not
	spiritually ready for so radical a transformation of the order
	in Germany.  The independent socialists -Kautsky, Hasse,
	Hildferding, etc.- were vacillant.   They inclined neither
	toward the limited and opaque reformism of the majoritarians,
	nor toward the Spartacists' revolutionism.  In the Bolshevik
	manner, the Spartacists began a campaign of mounting
	agitation.  The figures which led the Spartacus Union were,
	certainly, figures of the front rank of the German proletarian
	movement.  Karl Liebknecht was the son of Wilhelm Liebknecht,
	one of the patriarchs of German socialism.  He was, thus, heir
	to a glorious name in the history of German socialism, aside
	from possessor  of a bright, intense figure continuously in
	the vanguard of the proletariat.  Rosa Luxemburg, an
	international figure and an intellectual and dynamic figure,
	also had an eminent position within German socialism.  Her
	double capacity for action and for thought, for realization
	and for theory, were seen and respected.   Rosa Luxemburg was,
	at once, a brain and an arm of the German proletariat.  Franz
	Mehring was one of the most profound, shining, and erudite
	theoreticians of Marxism, author of a series of deep and
	admirable works, he had written a fundamental book precisely
	on Marx and on Marxism.   He was old, he was 72, but he kept
	the temper and fervor of his youth.  Eugen Leviné,  a
	Russian Pole, who participated in the 1905 Revolution in
	Russia, and who then endured prison in Siberia, was another
	noble and bizarre revolutionary figure -he came from a rich
	family and possessed a vast literary and scientific culture.
	He had, nonetheless, renounced his prerogatives as an
	intellectual and had become a worker.</P>

	<P>Leo Jogiches, Polish journalist, also a noteworthy kind of
	agitator, propagandist, and revolutionary, was the
	collaborator, the confidant, the friend of Rosa Luxemburg.  In
	the Polish socialist party he had played an outstanding role,
	and in the Spartacus Union he was the energetic and untiring
	organizer of action and propaganda.</P>

	<P>Clara Zetkin, the sole survivor from this group of leaders,
	conductors, and apostles, was of the same moral and
	intellectual stature.</P>

	<P>This strong, homogeneous, and intelligent general staff of
	Spartacism, managed to agitate, to powerfully shake up the
	German proletariat.  The German working masses lacked
	spiritual and revolutionary preparation, and I will speak to
	you of this in a moment in critiquing the revolution.
	Nevertheless, the Spatarcist leaders managed to organize a new
	proletarian vanguard.  This proletarian vanguard was a
	vanguard of action; but the Spartacist leaders did not intend
	to launch it prematurely to the seizure of power.  The
	proposed to use it to awaken the proletariat's consciousness,
	to day by day prepare it for action, strengthen it
	numerically,  ready it for the decisive assault at the
	opportune moment.</P>

	<P>The tactic of the majority socialists, of Ebert and
	Scheidemann's government, thus consisted in precipitating the
	Spartacists' revolutionary action, in drawing the Spartacists
	into combat prematurely, in obligating them to begin the
	battle unpreparedly.  The majority socialists needed the
	Spartacists' violence in order to repress their violence with
	an even greater violence, and, in this way, to eliminate an
	increasingly dangerous enemy.  The Spartacist masses,
	imprudently, did not measure their steps.  The governor of
	Berlin, Eichorn, was a left socialist, a revolutionary, widely
	popular in the German capital.  He was an element undocile
	toward the reaction and loyal to the revolution and to the
	proletariat.  The majority socialist government decided to
	demand his resignation.  This was a provocation toward
	Berlin's revolutionary proletariat.</P>

	<P>On Sunday, January 5 of 1919, there were large
	revolutionary demonstrations in Berlin.  The next day a strike
	was declared.  The masses, angry at the official organ of the
	Socialist Party, <I>Vorwärts</I>, -which had been taken
	over by several majority socialists- resolved to forcibly
	occupy this and other dailies. They built barricades, but took
	pains to avoid the spilling of blood, inviting the troops -by
	means of large signs- to not fire upon their proletarian
	brothers.  Nonetheless, the clashes soon began.   Some agents
	provocateurs, it seems, were used to spark the struggle.  The
	fact of the matter is that between the troops and the
	Spartacist masses battle was begun.  Noske, a majority
	socialist, took charge of the Ministry of War and, with the
	enthusiastic cooperation of the old regime's officers,
	organized the repression of the insurgents.  There were, in
	Berlin, several days of bloody battles.</P>

	<P>On Sunday the 12<SUP>th</SUP>, the Spartacists who were
	occupying Vorwärts sent six unarmed parleyers to negotiate
	peace with the besiegers of the occupied press.  The six
	parleyers were shot.  The fighting continued.  The Spartacist
	leaders had not wanted to lead the masses into struggle, but
	once it begun, once the battle had started, they felt it that
	their duty was to take up their posts alongside the
	masses.</P>

	<P>The authorities attributed to them sole responsibility for
	the insurrection of the Spartacist masses and set out in
	pursuit of them.   On the afternoon of January
	15<SUP>th</SUP>, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, who had
	hidden in a friendly house, in a neighborhood in west Berlin,
	in Wilmersdorf, were arrested by the troops.  Hours later,
	they were murdered.</P>

	<P>The official version of their deaths states that both tried
	to escape from their guards' hands, and that these, in order
	to avoid the escape, were forced to open fire and kill them.
	The truth, however, was another.</P>

	<P>Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg fell into the hands of
	officers of the old regime, fanatical enemies of the
	revolution, ranting reactionaries, who hated all the authors
	of the Kaiser's fall, believing them responsible for Germany's
	capitulation.  These people did not want the two great
	revolutionaries to enter prison alive.</P>

	<P>But the revolutionary wave was not extinguished with this
	bloody episode of the deaths of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa
	Luxemburg.  The German proletariat's vanguard kept on
	demanding socialist policies from the government.  The
	majority socialists, who -with the cooperation and approval of
	the bourgeoisie- had truculently put down the Spartacist
	insurrection, were each day more encumbered for carrying out a
	socialization program in government.</P>

	<P>In February and March the proletariat gradually resumes a
	combative posture.   Again, strikes break out, which from the
	Rhine region, and from Westphalia, spread to central Germany,
	to Baden, Bavaria, Wurtenberg.  In these strikes the workers
	move from demands for wage increases to the demand for
	socialization and the establishment of a soviet government.
	The majority government appeases these movements with a series
	of vague and pompous promises.  With these promises it manages
	to quiet the masses.  But, a part of them showed a decidedly
	revolutionary will, and  new bloody days took place in Berlin.
	The victims of the repression were, once again, counted in the
	thousands.   Spartacism lost another of its best leaders.  Leo
	Jogiches, captured soon after the March days, had a fate
	analogous to that of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg.  He
	was not murdered on the way to prison, but in the prison
	itself.  It was said tha he tried to escape (the eternal tale
	of escape), and that, because of this, it had been necessary
	to fire upon him.</P>

	<P>However, with these battles by Berlin's proletarian
	vanguard that period of revolutionary activity in Germany did
	not end.  The Munich proletariat also waged courageous
	battles, and the repression in Munich was bloodier, and more
	costly for the proletariat than the repression in Berlin.</P>

	<P>In Munich, in Bavaria, soviet governments were put in
	place.  The soviet republic of Munich was one of artificial
	sovietism, of communist window dressing, but this was natural.
	In the government, reformist elements, semi-bourgeois elements
	-which did not give the Bavarian Republic a truly
	revolutionary orientation- predominated.  Thus, the life of
	this soviet republic could not be a long one.  On the one
	hand, because this government -soviet in form, reformist in
	content- was incapable of disarming the bourgeoisie, of
	abolishing its privileges, nor of evicting it from its
	positions.  On the other hand, because Bavaria was the region
	of Germany least ready for the establishment of socialism.</P>

	<P>Bavaria is Germany's agricultural region.  Bavaria is a
	country of estates and latifundia, not of factories.  </P>

	<P>The industrial proletariat, the axis of proletarian
	revolution,  is, thus, in the minority.  The agricultural
	proletariat, the agricultural middle class, absolutely
	predominates.  As is known, the agricultural proletariat does
	not have enough socialist saturation, enough class-conscious
	education,  to serve as the basis for the socialist order.</P>

	<P>The instrument of the socialist revolution shall always be
	the industrial proletariat, the proletariat of the cities.
	Furthermore, the carrying out of socialism in Bavaria was not
	possible while capitalism survived in the rest of Germany.
	Even so much as a socialist Bavaria, a communist Bavaria,
	within a bourgeois Germany was inconceivable.</P>

	<P>Once the revolution was defeated in Berlin, it was so in
	Munich as well.  The Bavarian communists did not give up the
	struggle, however, and fought without quarter to turn the
	Munich soviet republic into a true communist republic.  Little
	by little, this transformation began to take place.  The
	Bavarian proletariat's consciousness developed day by day.
	Truly revolutionary workers were chosen for the leading posts.
	That was, simultaneously, the moment of the bourgeois
	counteroffensive.  Victorious over the proletariat in Berlin,
	the German bourgeoisie began the attack on the proletariat in
	Munich.  The communist masses of Munich had no better fortune
	than those of Berlin.</P>

	<P>And, another of the leaders of Spartacism, Eugen Leviné
	-that Polish-Russian intellectual of whom I spoke to you a few
	moments ago- was the martyr of that revolutionary endeavor.
	Eugen Leviné was not murdered like Karl Liebknecht, like
	Rosa Luxemburg, etc., but was executed by firing squad in a
	Munich prison.   He was given a lightning trial and was
	condemned to death.   Facing the execution squad, Eugen
	Leviné behaved courageousl, and died with the cry, "Long
	live Universal Revolution!" on his lips.</P>

	<P>These, briefly narrated, are the main Spartacist episodes
	of the German Revolution.   This was the sharpest and
	climactic moment of the revolution.</P>

	<P>Once this period of agitation -which Spartacism's leaders
	created with their unflagging activity- had passed, the German
	people showed each day less revolutionary zeal.</P>

	<P>Power was, to begin with, in the hands of the majority
	socialists, backed by the independent socialists, in other
	words, by the centrist socialists.  It was then in the hands
	of the majority socialists alone.   Later, the majority
	socialists, educated in the democratic school, required the
	collaboration of two bourgeois parties: the Catholic Center,
	the party of Erzberger, and the Democratic Party, the party of
	Walter Rathenau and of the <I>Berliner Tageblatt</I>.</P>

	<P>As the majority socialists, opposed to the thesis of the
	dictatorship of the proletariat, had scheduled parliamentary
	elections, they were left at the mercy of the combinations of
	parliamentary equilibrium.  Lacking the collaboration of one
	part of the socialist votes, they had to look for cooperation
	from an equal or greater number of bourgeois votes.  The
	national assembly sanctioned a democratic constitution in
	Weimar; but not a socialist constitution.  The majority
	socialists could not entirely hold on to power within the
	parliamentary order; but they were indispensable for the
	formation of a majority.  That is why we have seen them enter
	all the coalition cabinets that have followed.  But it the
	present cabinet, the cabinet of Cuno, the majority socialists
	no longer appear.</P>

	<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>
	<P>Their benevolent neutrality in parliament continues being
	necessary for the life of the cabinet.  However, the cabinet
	is no longer a cabinet with majority socialist participation,
	but a coalition cabinet of the German bourgeois parties, a
	coalition in which only the extreme bourgeois right is
	missing, only the pan-Germanic party, that is, the party of
	the monarchy.</P>

	<P>Following the Spartacist insurrection, the German
	Revolution has done naught but turn to the right, always to
	the right.  First, power was exercised by the right and center
	socialists jointly; then, by the right socialists alone.
	Later, by the right socialists in collaboration with the more
	liberal bourgeois parties.</P>

	<P>Currently, through these bourgeois parties, sheltered by
	the right socialists' benevolent neutrality, little by little,
	the German Revolution has been losing all socialist character
	and been affirming its democratic character, its bourgeois
	character.  That is why it is now said that the German
	Revolution hasn't yet been consummated.  That the German
	Revolution has but begun.</P>

	<P>Rudolf Hilferding, he old leader of the independent
	socialists, said in the Halle Congress in 1920 that, "We have
	always said that December 9, in a certain way, was not a true
	revolution.  We did all that was possible, first during the
	war, and then at the start of the revolution, to give the
	latter the most decisive shape."  And, Walter Rathenau
	-democratic leader, notable thinker of the German bourgeoisie,
	who, as you will recall, was killed a year ago by a German
	nationalist- in his noteworthy book, <I>The Triple
	Revolution</I>, puts forth some very interesting opinions
	about the shape and reach of the German Revolution.  Walter
	Rathenau says: "We call the 'German Revolution' something that
	was the general strike of a defeated army."</P>

	<P>Later, Walter Rathenau points out that, while in Russia
	there was an old revolutionary preparation, in Germany there
	was no revolutionary preparation at all.  The German
	proletariat lacked revolutionary stimulus.  It enjoyed a
	discretely comfortable lifestyle.  It was able to live with
	hygiene, with relaxation, with cleanliness.  It was even able
	to save modestly.   The State helped large families.  In the
	economic field, the German proletariat had made greater gains
	than any other proletariat.  That is precisely why it had lost
	interest in conquests in the political field.</P>

	<P>The Kaiser, the monarchy, reserved for themselves the
	conduction of the State's foreign and internal policy.  This
	mostly  did not bother the proletariat because it did not
	infringe on any of its immediate interests.  Consequently, in
	the German proletariat there was no true state of
	revolutionary consciousness.   Said differently, this state of
	consciousness was too embryonic, too nascent, too incipient.
	Thus the revolution caught the German proletariat unprepared.
	Naturally, since then, the German proletariat's revolutionary
	preparation has made strides. Today that preparation is much
	greater than in 1918.</P>

	<P>The bourgeois State turns each day further to the right,
	but the popular masses turn each day further to the left.
	Each day they show greater revolutionary saturation,
	consciousness, and preparation.   Precisely that separation of
	the majority socialists from government has occurred under
	pressure from the masses.</P>

	<P>For all these reasons, the current German events are but
	episodes in the German Revolution, the current bourgeois
	government of Germany is but a period, a chapter, of the
	German Revolution.  The German Revolution has not been
	consummated because a revolution is not consummated in months
	nor in years; but, neither has it been aborted, nor has it
	failed.  The German Revolution only begun.  We are witnessing
	its development.</P>

	<P>A period of bourgeois reaction is a period of bourgeois
	counteroffensive, but not of definitive proletarian defeat.
	From this point of view -which is logical, which is fair,
	which is exact, which is historical- the fascist government,
	the fascist reaction in Italy, is but an episode, a chapter, a
	period of the Italian Revolution, of the Italian civil war.
	Fascism is in government, but the Italian proletariat has not
	capitulated, it has not disarmed, it has not surrendered.  It
	prepares for revenge.</P>

	<P>Meanwhile, in order to get into government, fascism has had
	to trample the principles of democracy, of parliamentarianism;
	it has had to undermine the institutional bases of the old
	order of things, to teach the people that power is seized
	through violence, to give practical demonstration that it is
	retained but through dictatorship.  And, all this is eminently
	revolutionary.  All this is a service to the revolution's
	cause.</P>

	<P>In the next lecture I will deal with the dissolution of the
	Austro-Hungarian Empire and with the Hungarian Revolution.  I
	shall then begin the examination of the Versailles Peace, of
	that peace which has been the failure of Wilson's democratic
	illusions, and which has left Europe the legacy of this
	situation.</P>

	<P>However, this will not be next Friday because next Friday
	is July 27, night of fireworks and revelry, but Friday the
	4<SUP>th</SUP> of August.</P>
