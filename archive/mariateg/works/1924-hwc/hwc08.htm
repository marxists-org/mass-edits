	<P>Author's Notes:

	<P>The major German political groups are: pangermanists,
	populists, Catholics, democrats, socialists, communists.
	Consul Organization, Eschrish Organization, Hittler and
	Ludendorf's Bavarian fascism.

	<P>Antecedents to the present situation:  The fall of Wirth's
	cabinet.  The formation of the Cuno cabinet.  The return of
	Hugo Stinnes' populists' to government.  The socialists'
	position on this government.  The effects of the occupation of
	the Rohr on German politics.  The current German crisis is but
	the exasperation of the political crisis brought about by
	Social Democracy's collaboration with the bourgeoisie.  Cuno's
	resignation.  Stressemann's cabinet.  Minister of Finance
	Hilferding.

	<P>Rhennish separatism.  Smeets and Dorten's separatist
	factions. Their agitation and coming fusion.  France's
	promotion of it.

	<P>The occupation of the Rohr's consequences on the German
	economy.  The catastrophe of the mark.  The impossibility that
	mutilated, fractured Germany reorganize itself.  A nation is a
	living organism.  It is not possible to wound it without
	altering, without disordering its functioning.  The occupation
	of the Rohr condemns Germany to ruin, to misery.   But, a
	ruined Germany means a worsening of the European economic
	crisis.  Moribund nations, starving nations cannot coexist
	with  nations filled with vitality, plethoric nations.  The
	world's economic organism has become too solidarious for this
	to occur.  A nation that is primitive, insignificant, and
	little-evolved economically can descend into misery without
	visibly affecting the other nations of the continent.  But a
	nation with so complex and so vast an international dynamism
	cannot be brought down and destroyed without mortal damage to
	its neighbors.  The problems of peace have uncovered this
	solidarity between victors and the defeated which prevents the
	former from crushing the latter.

	<P>The true causes of the occupation of the Rohr.  The
	chauvinists, the nationalists desire the annihilation of
	Germany.  They have the nightmare of German reconstruction, of
	German revenge.  The metallurgists aspire to posses German
	coal. The metallurgists' press exploits the patriotism of the
	petit bourgeois classes.  The national bloc, the left bloc,
	and the communists.

	<P>Stinnes' program: suppression of the eight-hour workday,
	reduction of State personnel, handing over of the railways to
	private enterprise.  In a word, the abolition, the derogation
	of all the conquests of the socialist minimum program.  A
	bourgeois coalition lacks the strength to act on this plan.

	<P>The dissention within social-democracy.  The left tendency
	and the right tendency.   The fear of communist participation.

	<P>The policies of the German communists, Dacussig,
	Stöcker.  The factory councils.  The proletarian united
	front. The workers' government.  The nationalization of 51
	percent of the businesses, under the workers' control.  The
	Social Democrats and their apprehensions and fears. 

	<P>The nationalist phenomenon. The penury middle- and petit
	bourgeois.  The poverty of the intellectuals.  Radek proposes
	that fascism be fought not only with arms but also with
	political weapons. The middle class, dominated by the memory
	of its past well-being, leans toward a re-establishment of the
	old order. It lacks a class mentality, class consciousness.  A
	government of the middle class cannot but carry out capitalist
	policies.  The middle class needs to join either the
	capitalist class or the salaried class.  It has no room for a
	middle or independent position.

	<P>Which are the present hour's perspectives?  An immediate
	rectification of French policies is not probable.  Occupation
	of the Rohr will, therefore, continue to disorganize,
	impoverish and ruining Germany.  There is talk of the
	possibility that German and French industrialists coordinate
	and make an arrangement. This alliance of French capitalism
	with German capitalism would be made only at the expense of
	the working class.  There already have been preludes of
	intelligence of this nature: the Loucheur-Lubersac agreement.
	This intelligence would disquiet England.  German industry and
	French industry would constitute a formidable continental
	bloc.  Likewise, there is talk of England proposing the
	formation of an Anglo-Franco-German conglomerate.  Lastly,
	Mussolini dreams of a continental bloc: Germany, France, and
	Italy.  But these projects stumble over the difficulty of
	nationalist egoisms.  Each power longs for an alliance in
	which it gets the lion's share.  The climate left by the war
	is a noxious and asphyxiating climate.  It is poisoned by
	hates, rancors, and egoistic passions.  The reasoning that
	common sense and common interests will prevail in the
	mentality of the various European capitalist groups is a
	reasoning which ignores the dark and mysterious, but decisive,
	influence which psychological factors have on the march of
	history.
