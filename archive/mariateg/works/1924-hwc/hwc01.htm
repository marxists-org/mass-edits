<p class="fst">In this lecture -- let us call it conversation rather than lecture
-- will limit myself to laying out the course&#8217;s program, as well as some
thoughts on the need to spread knowledge of world crisis among the proletariat.
Unfortunately, in Peru there is a lack of an educating press which will
follow the development of this great crisis with attentiveness, intelligence,
and an ideological filiation; likewise, there is a lack of university professors,
of Jos&eacute; Ingenieros&#8217; kind, capable of being passionate about the
ideas of renovation which are currently changing the world, and of freeing
themselves from the influence and prejudices of a conservative and bourgeois
culture and education; there is a lack of socialist and syndicalist groups,
in possession of their own instruments of popular culture, and thus capable
of making the people interested in studying the crisis. The only popular
educational institution, with a revolutionary spirit, is this institution-in-formation,
the People&#8217;s University. It thus falls to it, beyond the modest plane of
its initial work, to present contemporary reality to the people, explain
to the people that it is living through one of the greatest and most transcendental
times in history, and infect the people with the fruitful restlessness
which currently moves the other civilized peoples of the world.

<p>&nbsp;In this great contemporary crisis, the proletariat is not a spectator;
it is an actor. In it the fate of the world proletariat is to be resolved.
From it will emerge -- according to all odds and predictions -- the proletarian
civilization, the socialist civilization, destined to succeed the declining,
decadent, moribund capitalist, individualist, and bourgeois civilization.
The proletariat needs, now more than ever, to know what happens in the
world. It cannot know it by way of the fragmented, occasional, homeopathic
reports of the daily cable -- badly translated, and worse written, in most
instances -- coming always from reactionary agencies encharged with discrediting
the Revolution&#8217;s parties, organizations, and men, and of discouraging and
disorienting the world proletariat.

<p>&nbsp;In the European crisis the destinies of the workers of the world
are in play. The crisis&#8217; development should thus interest Peruvian workers
and the workers of the Far East alike. The crisis has Europe as its primary
theater; but the crisis of European institutions is the crisis of the institutions
of Western civilization. And, Peru, like the other countries of the Americas,
moves within the orbit of that civilization, not only because we are dealing
with countries which are politically independent but economically colonial,
tied to cart of British, or American, or French, capitalism, but also because
our culture is European, and European is the type of our institutions.
And, it is precisely these democratic institutions -- which we copied from
Europe -- this culture -- which we also copied from Europe -- which in
Europe are now in a period of definitive, total, crisis. Above all, capitalist
society has internationalized humanity&#8217;s life, it has forged material bonds
between all the peoples which establish between them an inevitable solidarity.
Internationalism is not an ideal, it is a historical reality. Progress
causes the interests, the ideas, the customs, the regimes of the peoples
to become united and mingled. Peru, like other American countries, is therefore
not outside the crisis; it is within it. The world crisis has already echoed
amongst these peoples, and, of course, it shall continue to echo. A period
of reaction in Europe will also be a period of reaction in America. A period
of revolution in Europe will also be a period of revolution in America.
Over a century ago, when humanity&#8217;s life was not as solidarious as it is
today, when there did not exist the means of communication which exist
today, when nations did not have the immediate and constant contact they
have today, and when we were but distant spectators to European events,
the French Revolution gave birth to the War of Independence and the emergence
of these republics. This memory is enough for us to realize the speed with
which the transformation of society shall be reflected in American societies.
Those who say that Peru, and America in general, live far removed from
the European revolution, have no notion of contemporary life, have no --
not even an approximate -- understanding of history. These people are surprised
that Europe&#8217;s most advanced ideals should make it to Peru; but, by contrast,
they are not surprised that the airplane, the ocean liner, the wireless
telegraph, the radio -- in short, all the most advanced expressions of
Europe&#8217;s material advance -- make it. There would be the same reason for
ignoring the socialist movement as there would be for ignoring Einstein&#8217;s
theory of relativity. I am sure that it would not occur to the most reactionary
of our intellectuals -- almost all are impenetrable reactionaries -- that
the new physics, of which Einstein is the most eminent and the greatest
representative, ought to be banned from study and dissemination.

<p>&nbsp;If the proletariat in general needs to learn about the great aspects
of the world crisis, this need is even greater in that part of the proletariat
-- socialist, Laborite, syndicalist, or libertarian -- which makes up its
vanguard; in that more combative and more conscious, more fighting and
more prepared, part of the proletariat; in that part of the proletariat
which is in charge of the leadership of the great proletarian actions;
in that part of the proletariat to which falls the historical role of representing
the Peruvian proletariat in the present social moment; in short, in that
part of the proletariat which, whatever it particular credo, has class
consciousness, has revolutionary consciousness. I dedicate my dissertations,
above all, to this vanguard of the Peruvian proletariat. No one needs to
study the world crisis more than the vanguard proletarians. I have no pretensions
of coming to this free rostrum, of a free university, to teach them the
history of that world crisis, but to myself study it with them. I do not
teach you from this grandstand, comrades, the history of the world crisis;
I study it with you. I have, in this study, but the very modest merit of
bringing to it personal observations from three and one-half years of European
living, in other words, of the three and one-half climactic years of the
crisis, and the echoes of contemporary European thinking.

<p>&nbsp;I specially invite the vanguard of the proletariat to study with
me the process of the world crisis, for several very important reasons.
These I will briefly enumerate. The first reason is that the revolutionary
preparation, the revolutionary culture, and the revolutionary orientation
of that proletarian vanguard have been formed on the basis of the socialist,
syndicalist, and anarchist literature from before the European war. Or
prior, at least, to the climactic period of the crisis. Generally, it is
outdated socialist, syndicalist, and libertarian books which circulate
among us. Here a little is known of the classic literature of socialism
and of sydicalism; the new revolutionary literature is unknown. Revolutionary
culture here is a classical culture, aside from being - as you well know,
comrades -- a new, very unformed, very disorganized, very incomplete culture.
Now, all that pre-war socialist and syndicalist literature is being revised.
And that revision is not one imposed by the whim of theoreticians, but
by the force of events. That literature, therefore, cannot be used without
the benefit of an inventory. Naturally, it is not that it is no longer
exact in its principles, in all that ideal and eternal that there is in
it, but that it has often ceased to be exact in its tactical inspirations,
in its historical considerations, in all that means action, procedure,
means of struggle. The workers&#8217; goal remains the same, what have necessarily
changed, due to the latest historical events, are the roads chosen to arrive
at, even just approach, that ideal goal. It is from this that the study
of these historical events and of their significance becomes indispensable
to workers who are militants in class-conscious organizations.

<p>&nbsp;Comrades, you know that the European proletarian forces are divided
into two great camps: reformists and revolutionaries. There is a reformist,
collaborationist, evolutionist Workers&#8217; International, and another maximalist,
anti-collaborationist, revolutionary Workers&#8217; International. Between the
one and the other, there has attempted to emerge an intermediate International.
But it has ended up by making common cause with the former against the
latter. In one and the other sides there are various hues, but the sides
are clearly and unmistakably but two. The side of those who wish to bring
about socialism by collaborating politically with the bourgeoisie, and
the side of those who seek to bring about socialism by seizing political
power entirely for the proletariat. Of course, the existence of these two
sides comes from the existence of two different views, two opposed views,
two antithetical views, on the current historical moment. One part of the
proletariat believes that the moment is not a revolutionary one, that the
bourgeoisie has not yet played out its historical role, that, on the contrary,
the bourgeoisie is still strong enough to hold on to political power; that,
in short, the hour of social revolution has not yet arrived. Another part
of the proletariat believes that the current historical moment is revolutionary,
that the bourgeoisie is incapable of rebuilding the social wealth destroyed
by the war, and incapable, therefore, of solving the problems of peace;
that the war has brought about a crisis whose solution cannot be but a
proletarian solution, a socialist solution, and, that, with the Russian
Revolution, the social revolution has begun.

<p>&nbsp;There are, then, two proletarian armies because there are within
the proletariat two opposing views of the historical moment, two different
interpretations of the world crisis. The numerical strength of one or the
other of the proletarian armies is dependent on whether or not events appear
to confirm its respective historical view. It is because of this, that
thinkers, theoreticians, studious men of one and the other proletarian
armies struggle above all to delve deeply into the meaning of the crisis,
to understand its character, to discover its significance.

<p>&nbsp;Before the war, two tendencies split up predominance among the
proletariat: the socialist tendency, and the syndicalist tendency. The
socialist tendency was, mostly, reformist, social-democratic, collaborationist.
The socialists thought that social revolution&#8217;s hour was far off, and fought
for gradual conquest through legalistic action and governmental, or at
least, legislative, collaboration. In some countries this activity excessively
weakened the revolutionary will and spirit of socialism. Socialism was
considerably bourgeoisified. As a reaction against this bourgeosification
of socialism, we had syndicalism. Syndicalism countered the political activity
of the socialist parties with the direct action of the unions. The proletariat&#8217;s
most revolutionary and intransigent spirits found refuge within syndicalism.
But, deep down, syndicalism also turned out to be collaborationist and
reformistic. Syndicalism also was dominated by a union bureaucracy lacking
a true revolutionary psychology. And, syndicalism and socialism showed
themselves to be conjoined in some countries, such as Italy, where the
Socialist Party did not take part in the government and remained loyal
to other formal principles of independence. Such as it is, the more or
less contending, or -- depending on the country -- more or less close,
tendencies were two: syndicalist and socialist. It is to this period of
social struggle that the revolutionary literature which has fed the mentality
of our leading proletarians belongs.

<p>&nbsp;But, the situation has changed after the war. The proletarian
camp, as we have just recalled, is no longer divided into socialists and
syndicalists, but into reformists and revolutionaries. First, we have witnessed
a schism, a split, in the socialists camp. One part of socialism has held
fast in its social-democratic, collaborationist, course; the other part
has followed a anti-collaborationist, revolutionary, course. And, it is
this part of socialism which, in order to set itself apart from the former,
has adopted the name of communism. The split has also taken place in the
same way in the syndicalist camp. One part of the unions supports the social-democrats,
and the other supports the communists. The outlook of European social struggle
has, therefore, shifted radically. We have seen many intransigent pre-war
syndicalists head toward reformism. We have, by contrast, seen others follow
communism. And, among these -- as I recalled to comrade Fonk&eacute;n in
a conversation not long ago -- can be counted the greatest and most illustrious
theorist of syndicalism: the Frenchman, Georges Sorel. Sorel, whose death
has been a bitter mourning for the French proletariat and intelligentsia,
gave all his adherence to the Russian Revolution and to the men of the
Russian Revolution.

<p>&nbsp;Thus, here, as in Europe, the proletarians have to divide, not
into syndicalists and socialists -- an anachronistic classification --
but into collaborationists and anti-collaborationists, into reformists
and maximalists. But, in order that for this classification to take place
clearly, coherently, it is indispensable that the proletariat know and
understand the great contemporary crisis in its broad features. Otherwise,
confusion is inevitable.

<p>&nbsp;I hold to the opinion of those who believe that humanity is living
through a revolutionary period. I am convinced of the approaching decline
of all social-democratic theses, of ll reformist theses, of all evolutionist
theses.

<p>&nbsp;Before the war, these theses were understandable, because they
corresponded to different historical conditions. Capitalism was in its
apogee. Production was superabundant. Capitalism could still allow itself
the luxury of making successive economic concessions to the proletariat.
Its margins of utility were such that the formation of a middle class,
of a petty bourgeoisie which enjoyed a comfortable life-style, was possible.
The European laborer earn enough to eat discreetly, and in some countries,
such as England and Germany, he could satisfy some spiritual needs. The
was not, then, an atmosphere for revolution. After the war, everything
has changed. Europe&#8217;s social wealth has, in great measure, been destroyed.
Capitalism, responsible for the war, need to rebuild that wealth at the
expense of the proletariat. It, therefore, wants socialists to collaborate
in the government, in order to strengthen democratic institutions; not
in order to make progress down the road of socialist fulfillment&#8217;s. Previously,
socialists collaborated in order to gradually improve the workers&#8217; living
conditions. Today they would collaborate in order to renounce all proletarian
conquest. In order to rebuild Europe the bourgeoisie requires that the
proletariat agree to produce more and consume less. And, the proletariat
objects to one thing and the other and says to itself that it is not worthwhile
to consolidate in power a class that is guilty of the war and destined,
fatally, to lead humanity to an even crueler war. The conditions for a
collaboration by the bourgeoisie with the proletariat are, by nature, such
that collaborationism must necessarily, bit by bit, lose its current numerous
proselytism.

<p>&nbsp;Capitalism cannot make concessions to socialism. In order to rebuild
themselves European states require a regimen of rigorous fiscal economy,
increase in work hours, lowering of salaries, in short, the re-establishment
of economic concepts and methods abolished in homage to proletarian will.
Logically, the proletariat cannot cannot consent to this reversal. It cannot,
nor doe it wish to, consent to it. All possibility of rebuilding the capitalist
economy is thus eliminated. This is the tragedy of today&#8217;s Europe. In the
European countries, the reaction is canceling the economic concessions
made to socialism; but, while on the one hand this reactionary policy cannot
be sufficiently energetic and effective as to re-establish the bled-dry
public wealth, on the other, the proletariat&#8217;s united front is preparing
itself, slowly, against that reactionary policy. Fearful of revolution
the reaction thus cancels, not only the masses&#8217; economic conquests, but
moves also against political conquests. Thus, in Italy, we bear witness
to the fascist dictatorship. But the bourgeoisie thus undercuts and saps
and mortally wounds democratic institutions. It loses all of its moral
strength and al its ideological prestige.

<p>&nbsp;Moreover, in international relations, the reaction places foreign
policy in the hands of nationalist and anti-democratic minorities. These
nationalist minorities saturate that foreign policy with chauvinism. With
their imperialist leanings, and their fight for European hegemony, they
block the re-establishment of an atmosphere of European solidarity which
would allow States to agree on a program of cooperation and work. The work
of that nationalism, of that reactionism, is evident in the occupation
of the Ruhr.

<p>&nbsp;The world crisis is, then, an economic and a political crisis.
And, it is also, above all, an ideological crisis. The affirmative, positivist,
philosophies of bourgeois society are, since long ago, undermined by a
current of skepticism, of relativism. Rationalism, historicism positivism,
irremediably decline. This is undoubtedly the deepest aspect, the gravest
symptom, of the crisis. This is the most definite and deepest indication
that what is in crisis is not only bourgeois society&#8217;s economy, but is
capitalist civilization, Western civilization, European civilization in
its entirety.

<p>&nbsp;Well, now. The ideologues of Social Revolution, Marx and Bakunin,
Engels and Kropotkin, lived at the time of the height of capitalist civilization
and of historicist and positivist philosophy. Consequently, the could not
foresee that the ascendancy of the proletariat had to occur by virtue of
the decadence of Western civilization. The proletariat was destined to
create a new type of civilization and culture. The economic ruin of the
bourgeoisie was also to be the ruin of bourgeois civilization. And, socialism
would find itself with the need to govern, not in a time of plenty, but
in a time of poverty, misery, and scarcity. Reformist socialists, accustomed
to the notion that the socialist order, more than a mode of production,
is a mode of distribution, believe they see in this the sign that the historic
mission of the bourgeoisie is not yet played out and that time is not ripe
for the realization of socialism. In a report for &#8220;La Cr&oacute;nica&#8221; I
recalled those phrases to the effect that the tragedy of Europe is the
following: capitalism no longer can, and socialism cannot yet. This phrase,
which does in fact give one a sense of the tragedy of Europe, is a reformist&#8217;s
phrase, it is a phrase saturated with evolutionist mentality, and impregnated
with the notion of a slow, gradual, and beatific movement, without convulsions
nor tremors, from individualist society to collectivist society. History
teaches us that every new social state has taken shape on the ruins on
the preceding social state, and that between the emergence of one and the
downfall of the other, there has, logically, been an intervening period
of crisis.

<p>&nbsp;We are witnessing the disintegration, the agony of a worn-out,
senile, decrepit society, and, at the same time, we are witnessing the
slow and restless gestation, the formation, the creation, of the new society.
All men, for whom a sincere ideological filiation binds to the new society
and separates us from the old, must profoundly fix our gaze on this, agitated
and intense, transcendental period in human history.
