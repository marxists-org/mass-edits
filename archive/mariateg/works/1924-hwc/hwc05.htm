<p class="fst">According to the program for this course on the History of the World
Crisis, the subject for tonight&#8217;s lecture is the Russian Revolution. The
course program assigns the following summary to tonight&#8217;s lecture: The
Russian Revolution. Kerensky. Lenin. The Peace of Brest-Litovsk. Russia
and the Entente before the Revolution. Initial process of creation and
consolidation of the Russian institutions.

<P>Before speaking on these topics, I consider a warning to be opportune.
The things I am going to say about the Russian Revolution are basic things.
That is to say, they are things which, to other audiences, would seem too
elementary, too popularized, too often repeated, because those audiences
have been abundantly informed about the Russian Revolution, its men, its
episodes. In Europe, the Russian Revolution has been of interest, and will
continue to be of interest, to people&#8217;s unanimous curiosity. In Europe,
the Russian Revolution has been, and will continue to be a subject of general
study. Innumerable books have been published about the Russian Revolution.
The Russian Revolution had occupied a high-priority place in all the European
dailies and magazines. The study of this event has not been sectarianly
reserved for its partisans, for its propagandists: it has been taken up
by all inquisitive men, by all men with any intellectual curiosity.

<P>The European bourgeoisie&#8217;s principal organs, the largest presses of
European capitalism, have sent correspondents to Russia, in order to inform
their audiences about the Russian institutions and about the Revolution&#8217;s
figures. Naturally, those large dailies have invariably attacked the Russian
Revolution, have made use of numerous polemical weapons against it, but
their correspondents -- not all, naturally, but many of them -- have spoken
with some objectivity about Russian events. They have acted as simple chroniclers
of Russia&#8217;s situation. Obviously, this has been due, not to benevolence
toward the Russian Revolution, but because those large news dailies, in
their competition for disputing one another for readers, for disputing
clients, have been forced to satisfy the public&#8217;s curiosity with some seriousness
and some circumspection. The public demanded more or less serious, and
more or less circumspect, information about Russia from them, and they
-- without lessening their aversion to the Russian Revolution -- had to
give the public that more or less serious, and more or less circumspect
information.

<P>Correspondents from Associated Press of New York, correspondents from
Corrierre della Sera, from the Messagero, and other large Italian presses,
correspondents from Theodor Wolf&#8217;s large democratic daily, the Berliner
Tageblatt, correspondents from the London press, have gone to Russia. Many
great contemporary writers have gone as well. One of those has been Wells.
I cite him at Random, I point him out because the attention attracted by
Wells&#8217; visit to Russia, and by the book which Wells wrote upon returning
to England, has been universal, has been very widespread, and, because
Wells is -- not even amongst us -- suspected of Bolshevism.

<P>Urged on by the scholarly public&#8217;s demand, the large publishing houses
of Paris, London, Rome, Berlin, have published compilations of Russian
laws and essays about this or that aspect of the Russian Revolution. These
books and pamphlets were not the work of Bolshevik propaganda, they were
simply an editorial business. The large publishers, the large booksellers,
made very good sums of money with those books and pamphlets. That is why
they published and distributed them. It could be said that the Russian
Revolution was in style. Just as speaking of relativism and Einstein&#8217;s
theory sounded good, speaking of the Russian Revolution and its leaders
sounded good.

<P>This, insofar as the bourgeois public, the amorphous public, is concerned.
As far as the proletariat is concerned, curiosity about the Russian Revolution
has, naturally, been much greater. In all the proletariat&#8217;s tribunes, all
its newspapers, all its books, the Russian Revolution has been commented
on, studied, and discussed. In the reformist and Social-Democratic sector
as much as in the anarchist sector, on the right, as on the left, and in
the center, of the proletarian organizations, the Russian Revolution has
been incessantly examined and observed.

<P>For these reasons, other audiences a vast knowledge of the Bolshevik
Revolution, of the soviet institutions, of the Brest-Litovsk Peace, of
these things which I will deal with tonight, and for those audiences my
lecture will be too basic, too rudimentary. But I have to keep in mind
the position of our public, ill-informed about this and other great European
events. The responsibility is not theirs, but of our intellectuals and
our scholars, who are, in reality, not any such intellectuals or scholars
but caricatures of scholars and caricatures of intellectuals. I will, thus,
speak tonight as a journalist. I shall narrate, I shall relay, I shall
tell, concisely, basically, without erudition and without literature.

<P>In the last lecture, after having quickly examined Italy&#8217;s intervention
and the United States&#8217; intervention in the Great War, we got to tsarism,
to the preliminaries to the Russian Revolution. We shall now examine the
months of the Kerensky government. Kerensky, a conspicuous member of the
Social-Revolutionary Party, whom I have already -- perhaps none too amicably
-- introduced to you, was the leader of the Russian government during the
months which preceded the October Revolution, that is, the Bolshevik Revolution.
Kerensky presided over the Social-Revolutionaries&#8217; and the Mensheviks&#8217;
coalition government with the Kadets and the Liberals. This coalition government
represented the middle groups within Russian public opinion. On the one
hand, the monarchists, the reactionaries, the extreme right, and, on the
other hand, the Bolsheviks, the Maximalist Revolutionaries, the extreme
left, were missing from this coalition.

<P>The absence of the extreme right was something logical, something natural.
The extreme right was the overthrown party. It was the royal family&#8217;s party.
By contrast, the presence within the coalition -- and, hence, in the ministry
headed by Kerensky -- of bourgeois elements, of capitalist elements, such
as the Liberals and the Kadets, changed the coalition and changed the government
into a melding, an amalgam, a heterogeneous, anodyne, colorless conglomeration.

<P>A government of conciliation, a coalition government, is conceived of
in another type of situation. But a government of conciliation is not conceived
of within a revolutionary situation. By force, a revolutionary government
has to be a faction government, a party government, it must represent only
the revolutionary nuclei of public opinion; it must not include the intermediate
groups, must not include the virtually, tacitly, conservative nuclei. Thus
the Kerensky government suffered from an organic defect, from a grave essential
vice. It embodied neither the proletariat&#8217;s ideals nor the bourgeoisie&#8217;s
ideals. It lived off of concessions, off of commitments to one side and
the other. One day, it gave in to the right; on another, it gave in to
the left. I repeat, all this fits within an evolutionist situation. But
it does not fit within a situation of civil war, of armed struggle, of
violent revolution. From the beginning, the Bolsheviks attacked the coalition
government, and demanded the constitution of a proletarian government,
of a workers&#8217; government, in short, of a revolutionary government. Well,
now, the proletarian, the workers&#8217;, groups in Russia were four. Four were
the nuclei of revolutionary opinion.

<P>The Mensheviks, in other words, the minimalists, headed by Martov and
Chernov, people with some tradition, and collaborationists. The Social-Revolutionaries,
to whose ranks Kerensky, Tseretelli, and others, belonged, who found themselves
split into two groups: one, on the right, favorable to coalition with the
bourgeoisie, and the one on the left, leaning toward the Bolsheviks. The
Bolsheviks, or the maximalists, the party of Lenin, of Zinoviev, of Trotsky.
And, the anarchists, who -- in the land of Kropotkin and Bakunin -- were,
naturally, numerous. The socialists were split into the first three groups:
Mensheviks, Social-Revolutionaries, and Bolsheviks. Because, as is natural,
in the period of struggle against tsarism all these proletarian forces
had struggled together. There were programmatic differences, but there
was community of forces and, above all, of efforts against the absolute
autocracy of the Tsars.

<P>What was the position, what was the make-up, which was the strength
of each of these proletarian groups? The Mensheviks and the Social-Revolutionaries
were dominant in the countryside, amongst the workers of the land. More
than of manual workers, their central nuclei were made up of middle-class
elements, of men from liberal professions, lawyers, doctors, engineers,
etc. The Social-Revolutionaries&#8217; left wing did, in fact, bring together
many truly proletarian and class-conscious elements, who, for this reason,
were attracted by the Bolshevik tactics and tendency, but would not break
with the group&#8217;s right wing.

<P>The men of the right and the center, such as Kerensky, were those who
represented the Social-Revolutionaries. Both parties, the Mensheviks and
the Social-Revolutionaries, were not, therefore, true revolutionary parties.
They did not represent socialism&#8217;s most dynamic, most class-conscious,
most homogeneous sector: the industrial proletariat, the proletariat of
the city. The maximalists were weak in the countryside; but they were strong
in the city.

<P>Their ranks were built on the basis of truly proletarian elements. In
the maximalist high command the intellectual element prevailed; but the
mass of members were workers.

<P>The maximalists acted in living, intense, constant, contact with the
workers of the factories and mills. They were the party of Petrograd&#8217;s
and Moscow&#8217;s industrial proletariat. The anarchists were also influential
amongst the industrial proletariat; but their central foci were intellectual
foci. Russia was traditionally the country of the anarchist, nihilist intelligentsia.

<P>Intellectuals, students, predominated in the anarchist nuclei. Of course,
anarchists fought the Mensheviks and Kerensky&#8217;s Social-Revolutionaries
as much as the Bolsheviks did, and, in some instances, in agreement with
them.

<P>This was the Russian proletariat&#8217;s political landscape under the Kerensky
government. In accordance with this summary of the situation, the majority
belonged to the coaligned Social-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks.

<P>The peasant masses and the middle class was on their side. And, the
peasant masses made up the majority in the agricultural nation, in a little-industrialized
nation such as Russia. In contrast, the Bolsheviks could count on the most
combative, most organized, most effective, elements, on the industrial
proletariat, on the workers of the city

<P>On the other hand, the Mensheviks and the Social-Revolutionaries could
not keep up their strength, their predominance among the peasant masses
if they did not satisfy two entrenched ideals, two urgent demands of those
masses: immediate peace and land distribution.

<P>The Kerensky government lacked the freedom of action for one or the
other thing. It lacked freedom of action for immediate peace because the
Allied powers, by which it was a fostered and protected, did not allow
it to reach a separate agreement with Germany. And it lacked freedom of
action to distribute lands to the peasants because its alliance with the
Kadets and the liberals, its commitments to the bourgeoisie, it understandings
with the land owners inhibited it, coerced it from this daring revolutionary
reform.

<P>Thus, Kerensky, in government, did not carry out the policies of the
socialist masses whom he represented; he carried out the policies of the
Russian bourgeoisie and the Allied powers. This political course made the
masses impatient. The masses wanted peace. And peace did not come. The
masses wanted the distribution of the lands. And the distribution of the
lands did not come, either.

<P>However, the impatience of the peasant masses would not have sufficed
to bring down Kerensky if it had, in fact, been the impatience only of
the peasant masses instead of being the army&#8217;s impatience as well. The
war was unpopular in Russia. I have already explained how the tsarist government
carried out the war with a mentality of relative war, that is, with a mentality
of war of armies and not war of nations; consequently, the tsarist government
had not been able to win the people&#8217;s adherence to its military endeavor.

<P>The people and the army hoped that for the revolution peace would emerge.
Kerensky&#8217;s inability to achieve peace roused the army -- which, unlike
the other Allied armies, did not perceive the myth of war of Democracy
against Autocracy because the Russian war had been directed by the tsarist
autocracy -- against his government. The army was tired of war, and deafly
demanded peace.

<P>The Bolsheviks aimed their propaganda in a sagaciously popular direction.
They demanded immediate peace and they demanded the distribution of lands.
And they told the proletariat: &#8220;Neither the one nor the other can be done
by a government of coalition with the bourgeoisie. We must replace this
government with a proletarian government, with a workers&#8217; government, with
a government of the parties of the working class. This government must
be the Soviets&#8217; government.&#8221; And the Bolsheviks&#8217; battle-cry was: &#8220;All political
power to the Soviets!&#8221;

<P>The Soviets existed since the fall of tsarism. The word &#8216;soviet&#8217; means
&#8216;council&#8217; in Russian. Once the Revolution was victorious, tsarism deposed,
the Russian proletariat proceeded to the organization of councils of workers,
peasants, and soldiers. The soviets -- the councils of the toilers of the
land and the factories grouped into local Soviets. The local Soviets created
a national body: the All-Russia Congress of Soviets. The -- soviets thus
fully represented the proletariat. In the soviets there were Mensheviks,
anarchists, and non-partisan workers.

<P>Kerensky and the Social-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks had not wanted
the Soviets to directly and exclusively exercise power. Educated in the
school of democracy, respectful of parliamentarianism, they had wanted
a ministry of coalition with the bourgeois parties -- parties without a
base within the soviets -- to exercise power. The proletariat&#8217;s organs
were not the government organs. There was in Russia a dual situation. Therefore,
the Bolsheviks&#8217; cry, &#8220;All political power to the Soviets!,&#8221; did not mean
&#8220;All political power to the Maximalist Party!&#8221;.

<P>It simply meant, &#8220;All political power to the organized proletariat!&#8221;
The Bolsheviks were in a minority in the soviets, in which the Social-Revolutionaries
prevailed. But, their activity, their dynamism, and their program, were
each day winning more followers in the workers&#8217; and soldiers&#8217; soviets.
Soon the Bolsheviks came to be a majority in the soviets of the capital
and other industrial centers.

<P>Consequently, Kerensky was not opposed to the Bolsheviks&#8217; coming into
government. He was opposed to the government passing into the hands of
the proletariat, within whose bodies he still held a majority.

<P>Kerensky and his men proceeded thusly because they feared the revolution,
because the idea of the revolution being carried to its extreme consequences,
to its final goal, terrified them, and because they understood that the
Bolsheviks would end up winning the majority in the soviets -- in part,
due to their personal worth and, in part, to their program, which was the
program of the masses.

<P>Under the pressure of political events and under the suggestion of the
Allied powers, Kerensky&#8217;s government committed a fatal adventure: the 18
June offensive against the Austro-Germans. For Kerensky, the military offensive
was a risky and dangerous card. But at least it was a transitory diversion
of public opinion.

<P>Kerensky&#8217;s government wanted to distract popular attention toward the
front. The Bolsheviks vigorously impugned the offensive. The Bolsheviks,
as I have said, interpreted the public&#8217;s desires for peace. Moreover, they
thought the military offensive carried two grave dangers for the revolution:
if the offensive succeeded -- something improbable, given the army&#8217;s conditions
-- it would unite the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, it would strengthen
them politically and would isolate the revolutionary proletariat; if the
offensive failed -- something almost certain -- the offensive would bring
about a complete dissolution of the army, a ruinous retreat, the loss of
new territories, and disillusionment of the proletariat.

<P>Leon Trotsky defines the Bolsheviks&#8217; position toward the offensive thusly,
in his book: From the October Revolution to the Brest-Litovsk Peace.

<P>The offensive, as had been foreseen, had lamentable consequences. The
Russian army suffered a hard blow. The masses&#8217; discontent with Kerensky,
the longing for immediate peace, were accentuated and spread. The Bolsheviks
began a violent campaign of agitation of the proletariat.

<P>The Kerensky government repressed this agitation campaign without remorse.
Many Bolsheviks were arrested, others had to flee and hide. In this situation
General Kornilov&#8217;s reactionary attempt took place. Pushed by the bourgeoisie,
which plotted intensely against the Revolution, he rebelled against Kerensky.
But his reactionary attempt had no echo amongst the soldiers at the front,
who desired peace and, knowing their chauvinist and nationalist mentality,
regarded reactionary elements with hostility.

<P>The workers of Petrograd vigorously rose up in defense of the Revolution.
Kornilov&#8217;s insurrection was completely aborted, but it served to increase
the masses&#8217; revolutionary vigilance and, consequently, to strengthen the
Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks redoubled the cry: &#8220;All governmental power to
the soviets!&#8221;

<P>The Social-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks, in order to calm, to
quiet the masses, resorted to a crafty maneuver: they put together a democratic
conference, a mixed assembly of the soviets and other autonomous groups,
whose composition assured Kerensky a majority. From the democratic conference
there emerged a democratic soviet. This democratic soviet, completed with
the representatives of the bourgeois parties allied with Kerensky, made
itself into a preliminary parliament. This preliminary parliament was to
move toward a Constituent Assembly. The Bolsheviks received fifty seats
in the preliminary Parliament, but the Bolsheviks left the preliminary
Parliament. They invited the Left Social-Revolutionaries, those who did
not share Kerensky&#8217;s ideas, to also abandon him. But the Left Social-Revolutionaries
did not decide to break with Kerensky and join the Bolsheviks. The situation
became ever more agitated. The atmosphere ever more flammable. Let us see
how the final spark was lit.

<P>In defense of the Revolution, the Petrograd Soviet had created a Revolutionary
Military Committee intended to safeguard the army from reactionary moves
such as Kornilov&#8217;s. This Revolutionary Military Committee, a fundamentally
revolutionary and proletarian grouping, lived in conflict with Kerensky&#8217;s
High Command. Kerensky conspired against its existence on the grounds that
it was not possible for two high commands to function in Petrograd.

<P>The government saw in the Revolutionary Committee the future center
of the Bolshevik revolution. It resolved then to take a series of military
measures which would assure it military control of Petrograd. It ordered
the distancing from Petrograd of troops loyal to the soviet and obedient
to the Revolutionary Military Committee, and the calling in of new troops
from the front. These dispositions unleashed the Bolshevik revolution.

<P>On 22 October, Kerensky&#8217;s High Command invited the garrison corps to
each send two delegates to reach an agreement on the moving away of rebellious
troops. The garrison corps responded that they would not obey but a resolution
from the Petrograd Soviet. It was the explicit declaration of the rebellion.

<P>Some troops, however, were still vacillating. The Bolsheviks carried
out, with efficient activity, a quick propaganda campaign to win them to
their cause. The Kerensky government called in troops from the front, these
troops got in communication with the Bolsheviks, who ordered them to stop
their advance. And, the final day arrived.

<P>On 25 October, the Petrograd troops surrounded the Winter Palace, the
Kerensky government&#8217;s refuge, and Leon Trotsky, in the name of the Revolutionary
Military Committee, announced to the Petrograd Soviet that Kerensky&#8217;s government
had ceased to exist and that from that moment on political powers passed
into the hands of the Revolutionary Military Committee, awaiting a decision
from the All-Russia Congress of Soviets.

<P>On 26 October, the Congress of Soviets met. Lenin and Zinoviev, persecuted
under the Kerensky government, reappeared, greeted with great applause.
Lenin presented two proposals: peace, and the distribution of lands to
the peasants. The two were instantaneously approved.

<P>The Bolsheviks invited the Left Social-Revolutionaries to collaborate
with them in the formation of a new government, but the Social-Revolutionaries,
always vacillating and irresolute, demurred from accepting. Then, the Bolshevik
Party wholly assumed the responsibility of government. The Congress of
Soviets entrusted power to a Soviet of People&#8217;s Commissars.

<P>The Bolshevik revolution had days of intense worry and constant threat.
The public employees and functionaries sabotaged it. The students of the
Military School rebelled. Bolshevik troops repressed this insurrection.
Kerensky, who had managed to flee the government palace, threatened Petrograd
at the head of General Krasnoff&#8217;s Cossacks, but the Bolsheviks overthrew
him in Tsarskoe Selo. And Kerensky fled a second time. The Bolsheviks sent
messengers to all the provinces, communicating the formation of a new government
and the passing of the decrees on peace and land distribution.

<P>The telegraph and the transportation services boycotted and cut off
communications. The troops at the front remained loyal to them because
they were the party of peace.

<P>There came a period of negotiations between the Soviets and the Entente.
The Soviets proposed to the Entente the joint negotiation of peace. These
proposals were not considered. The Bolsheviks were forced to approach the
Germans separately. The Brest-Litovsk negotiations began. Before and after
them, there were conversations between the diplomatic representatives of
the allied powers and Russia. But an agreement was impossible. The Allies
thought that the Bolsheviks would hardly last in government. The Brest-Litovsk
Peace was inevitable.

<P>This, quickly summarized, is the history of the Russian Revolution.
I will, at the end of this lecture course, give the history of the Soviet
Republic, the explanation of Russian legislation, the study of the Russian
institutions, the analysis of Soviet politics. In accordance with the course
program -- which, as I have said, groups events with a certain arbitrariness,
but allows a better overall understanding -- in the next lecture I shall
speak on the German Revolution. We will thus arrive at another substantial
episode, another primary chapter, in the history of the world crisis which
is the history of the breakdown, and of the decadence or the decline of
the proud capitalist civilization.
