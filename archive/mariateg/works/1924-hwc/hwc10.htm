<p class="fst">Author&#8217;s Notes:



	<P>"Proletarian agitation in Europe.  Italy on the verge of

	revolution.  The elections of 1919.  The factory occupations.

	The III International. The centrist International, or

	International two-and-one-half.  The socialist schism."



	<P>Let's see how this period of proletarian agitation was

	hatched.  During the war, the capitalist regime found itself

	forced to make numerous concessions to the working class and

	the socialist ideal. The proletariat's co-operation was

	indispensable.  The proletariat, and its economic doctrine,

	achieved some conquests, some advances, which increased its

	strength and strengthened its faith.  Later, there came

	another cause of proletarian affirmation: the Russian

	Revolution.  The European states exerted themselves, on the

	one hand, in asphyxiating the revolution in Russia and, on the

	other, in preventing its spread to the rest of Europe.  It was

	a moment of advance for the revolutionary idea.  A moment of

	offensive by the proletariat.  An instant of apogee for the

	revolution.  The social struggle's characteristic was the

	proletariat's initiative in attack.  In Germany, Bavaria,

	Austria, Hungary.  In the face of this offensive, the regime

	was forced to retreat, to pull back.  The most attentive and

	perspicacious statesmen understood then that it was not

	possible to save it without great sacrifices.  An advancedly

	reformist current dominated.  The bourgeoisie adopted a

	renovating attitude.  It affirmed its democratic and

	evolutionist leanings.  It condemned dictatorship.  It sang to

	peace. Exhalted universal suffrage and parliamentarism.  It

	covered the Versailles Peace with the League of Nations.

	Created the International Labor Office.  Called together the

	First Labor Congress in Washington.   This policy tended to

	divide the proletariat, drawing its largest masses to the path

	of collaboration and reform.  This division took place.  Part

	of the socialist parties and the unions spoke out for a

	revolutionary politics.  Another spoke in favor of a prudent

	and transactional policy which avoided all decisive and

	violent action.  The former created the III International.

	The latter organized the II International.  Some centrist,

	in-between elements kept their independence.   Later on they

	gathered in the International two-and-one-half.



	<P>The II International.  Berne, February 1919.  Lucerne,

	August 1919.  Geneva, 30 July 1920.  Reformist Syndicalist

	International.  November 1920. 



	<P>The III International.  1st. Congress 2-6 March

	1919. 2nd. Congress, July 1920.  Here were established the 21

	conditions which split the parties of France, Germany, etc.

	In Germany, Halle 12-17 October 1919.  In France, Tours

	December 1920.  In England, August of 1920.



	<P>The International 2 1/2.  Berne, December 1920, some months later in Vienna.



Also, mass actions.  In England, in 1920, the coalminers' strike.  In France, the railworkers' strike in May 1920, which brought about the decree dissolving the C.G.T. and the imprisonment of Souvarine, Loriot, and Dunois.  In Germany, the agitation in the Ruhr after Kapp's coup, in April 1920.  Spain and Japan.  The strikes in solidarity with proletarian Hungary against Horthy's reaction.  But in Italy the agitation reached even greater proportions.



	<P>The July 1919 strikes.  The November 1919 elections.  The

	general strike in protest against the attack on several

	socialist deputies.  The 1920 railway and postal workers'

	strikes.  The economic price of bread and the fall of Nitti.

	Giolitti's government.



<P>The factory occupations.  Their antecedents.   On June 18th

	the metalworkers demanded economic improvements relative to

	the rise in the cost of living.  Negotiations, proposals, and

	counterproposals.  On August 13th, break-down of the

	negotiations.  On August 21st obstructionism begins.  On

	August 30th the Romeo Factory of Milan, with close to 2,000,

	declared a <EM>lock-out</EM><A NAME="*" HREF="#n*">*</A>

	Immediately after, 300 factories were taken over in Milan. Immediately, the movement spread to all of Italy.



	<P>Aspects of the occupation's internal regime.  The carrying

	out of work.  The discipline.  The financing of the works.

	Vigilance.  The governmental attitude. The owners demanded the

	eviction of the workers by force.  The debate between the

	General Confederation on Labor and the Socialist Party.  The

	prevailing by the Confederation's thesis.  The control of the

	factories.  The government's intervention.  Meeting of workers

	and bosses, presided over by Giolitti, on September 15th in

	Turin.  Subjection of the industrialists.  The negotiations

	with the industrialists about pay for the days of work.  Pay

	of the agreed-upon increases from July 25th to August.  The

	government's decree.  The Metallurgical Congress approved the

	agreement.  It was ratified with a referendum.  148,000 votes

	against 42,000.  September 24th.



	<P>Later, the Livorna Congress.



	<P>Thus ended the revolutionary period and began the reactionary period.



	<P>Fascism is the reaction.  However, it accelerates the

	revolutionary process because it destroys the democratic

	institutions.  Fascism has devalued parliament and suffrage.

	Fascism has shown the path of dictatorship and violence.

	Earlier, democracy raised its characteristic institutions in

	opposition to bolshevism: parliament and universal suffrage.

	Now, the bourgeoisie discredits both institutions.  We have

	just seen, in Spain, a likewise anti-parliamentarian military

	movement.



	<P>Is the united front of the bourgeoisie possible?  Yes, but

	only provisionally, only while a decisive assault by the

	revolution is forestalled.  Later, each of the bourgeoisie's

	groups tries to regain its autonomy. Woe to the proletariat if

	the bourgeoisie were to be inspired by a single ideology and a

	single interest.  With the bourgeoisie there exist contrasts

	of ideology and interests, contrasts that nothing can

	suppress.  The radical, democratic, liberal, elements of the

	bourgeoisie, which are thus due to psychology and position in

	society, can consent temporarily to a conservative reaction

	absorbing them, but tend, immediately, toward re-establishing

	the old balance.  Why?  Because a united front is built on the

	basis a capitulation of the democratic and reformist ideals to

	the conservative ideals.  It is not made on the basis of a

	transaction, but on the basis of a renunciation.  There are

	capitalist elements, men of the bourgeoisie, who believe that

	a social transformation is necessary and that a dictatorially

	reactionary regime cannot last without exasperating the

	revolution and increasing its destructive impetus.  Nitti,

	Caileaux, Walter Rathenau.  Thus, the united front cannot be

	long-lasting; it would, in addition, provoke the united front

	of the proletariat.



	<P>The Western world is debated in this chaos, in this

	conflict.  Its political institutions do not correspond to new

	economic reality.  A part of its conservative forces speak out

	for a program of audacious reforms which would gradually

	transform society.  Another fears that the concessions to the

	revolution, once begun, would be impossible to stop.  And

	they, therefore, attempt to resist.  The proletariat needs to

	attentively follow this conflict's progress.
