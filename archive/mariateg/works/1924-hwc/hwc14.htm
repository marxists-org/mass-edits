<p class="fst">Author&#8217;s Notes:



<P>The framework of the Russian constitution is the following: Beginning:

He who does not work, does not eat. End: suppression of exploitation of

man by man. Middle: during the proletariat&#8217;s decisive struggle against

its exploiters power must belong exclusively to the working masses.



<P>&nbsp;The cell of the Soviet regime is the urban and rural soviet, or

council. These urban and rural soviets are grouped first in a volost congress,

then in district congresses, then in the regional congresses, and lastly

in the pan-Russian congress of soviets, made up of urban soviets&#8217; delegates

(one for every 25,000 inhabitants) and of provincial congress delegates

(one for every 125,000 inhabitants). The pan-Russian congress meets twice

a year. It appoints an executive central committee which is the supreme

authority in the intervals between congresses. From within itself, the

Executive Central Committee names the people&#8217;s commissars who, in turn,

make up a college or soviet. There are eighteen people&#8217;s commissars.



<P>The term of each delegate is three months. However, all delegates can

be recalled at any time. All the workers, without distinction of gender,

nationality, religion, etc., are the electors.



<P>There is no democratic dualism the soviet system. The soviets are, at

once, executive and legislative organs. The council of people&#8217;s commissars

is but a leadership committee, a general staff, for the soviet assembly.

Parliament, due to aging, is often out of step with the latest currents.

The soviet is in constant renovation, in constant change. All the undulations

of public opinion are reflected in the soviet. The soviet is the typical

organ of the proletarian regime, just as parliament is the typical organ

of the democratic system. It is a system of professional representation

and of class representation.



<P>The dictatorship of the proletariat, therefore, is not a party dictatorship,

but a class dictatorship, a dictatorship of the working class. When the

soviet regime was inaugurated, the Bolsheviks did not predominate except

in the urban soviets, in the industrial centers. In the peasants&#8217; soviets

the Social Revolutionary Party, which more closely corresponded to the

little-evolutionist and petty-bourgeois mentality of the peasants, predominated.

But the Bolsheviks attracted the collaboration of these peasant masses

by carrying out their program of peace and land distribution.



<P>The economy, the politics, of the soviet system constitute a transaction

between the interests of the urban workers and the interests of the rural

workers. The latter are not yet educated, prepared, trained for communism.

Their attitude had made the distribution of lands necessary, for example,

instead of their collective management. Gorky sees the future threat in

the peasantry, in its selfishness, in its ill will toward the city worker.

The need to spur production made freedom of small trade, for example, necessary.

In the beginning, under the requisitions system, the peasants reduced production.

Now, they increase it because free trade is an incentive for them. The

same happens among industrial workers. They are allowed to work over-time

to produce goods destined for free trade. In this way, the system achieves

an increase in production, and, insofar as it is organized on purely communist

bases, the satisfaction of needs which the State cannot yet address is

left to the private initiative and commerce of the workers and peasants.



<P>The soviets&#8217; foreign policy is eminently pacifist. The Federation of

Soviet Republics is based upon the right of its components to leave it.

It constitutes a voluntary association of nations. Russia has renounced

all territorial claims in Poland. It has recognized the independence of

Finland and of the Baltic provinces. The Red Army has as its primary objective

the defense of the Revolution. It is an instrument at the service of world

revolution. The Red Army is now one of 600,000 men.



<P>It has saved the regime from the counterrevolutionary assaults of Kolchak,

Denikin, Judenicht, Wrangel. It has imposed upon European powers the abandonment

of the policy of armed intervention in Russia. Russia has embassies accredited

in Berlin, in Warsaw, in Ankara. It has semi-official or commercial representatives

in England, Italy, and other important countries. It has attended the Geneva

Conference and, later, those of The Hague and Lausanne. Russia attended

the Lyon Fair, officially invited. A commission of French bankers has just

visited Russia.



<P>The blockade, another of the Entente&#8217;s weapons, has extraordinarily

damaged Russian production. And, it has caused the deaths of a great number

of peasants in the Volga region.



<P>Great care is given to education and instruction. The worker has access

to higher education. In 1917 there were 23 libraries in Petrograd and 30

in Moscow. In 1919, there were 49 in Petrograd and 85 in Moscow. Moscow&#8217;s

institutes have increased from 369 to 1357. School attendance, which was

three-and-a- half million, has increased to five million. Twelve thousand

new schools have been founded. The total number of libraries, which in

1919 was 13,500, in 1920 was more than 32,000. Twenty-four workers&#8217; universities

have been created.



<P>Gorky was placed in charge of founding the house of intellectuals, who

are, for the most part, hostile to the revolution. The arts are given great

encouragement. I have attended an exhibit of Russian art in Berlin. Russia

was abundantly represented at the last international exhibition in Venice.



<P>The eight-hour workday is rigorously observed. For those who work at

a night-job the workday is of seven hours. Every worker has the right to

42 hours of continuous rest every week. Every year he has the right to

vacation of one month, temporarily reduced to fifteen days. Social security

extends to the worker&#8217;s entire life: sickness, unemployment, accident,

old age, and maternity. Workers&#8217; control operates in production. There

are rest houses for workers. The summer residence of the former Grand Duke

Sergei in Ilisnkoye is the main sanitarium for fatigued workers.



<P>The professional alliances.



<P>The attention to children. Health homes for children. Children receive

instruction, food, and clothing. The protection of children begins at maternity.

The pregnant woman has the right to assistance from eight weeks before

the birth.



<P>Woman and the soviets. Women have all the civil and political rights.

The Prime Minister has been a Russian woman: Alexandra Kollontai. There

were several women in the delegation. Propaganda among women.



<P>The religious problem. Separation of the State and the School from the

Church. Irreligious propaganda.



<P>Marriage and its dissolution. A demand from one of the parties is enough

for a divorce.



<P>The N.E.P. The Public Economy Council. Milliutin. The electrification

of Russia. Concessions to foreign capital.



<P>The polemic with the Social Democrats and the anarchists. The soviets&#8217;

policy has emerged out reality, it has been dictated by events. In the

end, it has been influenced by the general European situation.



<P>The people&#8217;s tribunals and the revolutionary tribunal.
