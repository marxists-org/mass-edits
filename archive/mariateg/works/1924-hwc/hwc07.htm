	<P><BR>
	      <P>Tonight, we again take up our conversations on  the
	      history of the world crisis, which were interrupted by
	      three weeks of vacation.  We arrive, today, at an
	      interestingly dramatic chapter in the history of the
	      world crisis.  The program for this course of lectures
	      tells us the topic: The Hungarian Revolution.  Count
	      Karolyi. Bela Kun.  Horthy.  These three names, Karoly,
	      Bela Kun, Horthy, summarize the phases of the Hungarian
	      Revolution:  the insurrectional and democratic phase;
	      the communist and proletarian phase; the reactionary and
	      terroristic phase.  Karolyi was the man of the Hungarian
	      insurrection; Bela Kun was the man of the proletarian
	      revolution; Horthy is the man of the bourgeois reaction,
	      of the white terror and brutal and truculent repression
	      of the proletariat.

		<P>Here, where the Russian Revolution is poorly known,
		the Hungarian Revolution is even less well known, and
		this is understandable.  The story of the Russian
		revolution is the story of a victorious revolution,
		while the story of the Hungarian Revolution is, so
		far, the story of a defeated revolution.  The cable
		has not stopped telling us chilling things about the
		Russian Revolution and its men, but it has told us
		almost nothing of the Hungarian reaction and its men.
		And, the good bourgeois, so concerned about the red
		terror, the Russian terror,  are not concerned at all
		by the white terror, by Horthy's dictatorship in
		Hungary; nevertheless, there is nothing more bloody,
		more tragic, than this somber and medieval period of
		Hungarian life.  None of the crimes imputd to the
		Russian revolution can compare to the crimes committed
		by the bourgeois reaction in Hungary.

		  <P>We see, in order, the three phases of the
		  Hungarian Revolution.  I have already explained the
		  processes of the German Revolution and of the
		  Austrian Revolution.  Good.  The process of the
		  Hungarian Revolution is, in broad strokes, the same.
		  But it has always something phyisiognomical,
		  something particular to itself.  Aside from the
		  tiredness, the fatigue, the discontent with the war,
		  the Hungarian Revolution was prepared by the
		  longings for national independence, suddenly
		  awakened, excited, and stimulated by the Wilsonian
		  propaganda.

		    <P>Wilson encouraged peoples against autocracy and
		    against absolutism, and, at the same time, he
		    encouraged them against the foreign yoke.
		    Hungary, as you know, endured domination by the
		    Austrian dynasty of the Hapsburgs.

		      <P>The Hungarians, different in race, language,
		      and history, from the Austrians, did not
		      voluntarily coexist with the Hungarians within
		      the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Thus, the defeat
		      did not bring only revolution to Austro-Hungary,
		      it also brought about dissolution.  The
		      nationalities which made up the Austr-Hungarian
		      Empire became independent and
		      separated. Naturally, the victorious powers
		      stimulated this break-up of Austro-Hungary into
		      several small states.

			<P>As I have already stated on another
			occasion, the Austrian front was weakened
			before before the German front precisely
			because  of the separatist ideals of the
			nationalities which were part of
			Austro-Hungary and, consequently, the Austrian
			military front gave way before German military
			front.  Faced with the Italians' victorious
			offensive in the Piave, the Czechoslovak
			soldiers and the Hungarian soldiers, tired of
			the war, spontaneously threw down their
			weapons and refused to coninued fighting.
			This ocurred in the latter part of October,
			1918.  The front-line troops' rebellion
			against the war spread quickly to the entire
			Hungarian army.  Thus began the Hungarian
			Revolution, which, like the German Revolution,
			was, in Walther Rathenau's words, at first a
			general strike by a defeated army. Like the
			German Revolution, the Hungarian Revolution
			began with the military insurrection, but in
			Hungary this military insurrection was not
			followed immediately by a proletarian
			insurrection.  The proletarian movement was
			still too immature, too incipient.  The
			Hungarian proletariat still lacked a solid
			revolutionary class consciousness.  Count
			Michael Karolyi headed the first revolutionary
			government.  This government, which emerged
			from the October 31 insurrection, was a
			government of the radical bourgeoisie
			coaligned with Social-Democracy.

			  <P>Count Karolyi was, in a way, the
			  Hungarian Revolution's Kerenski.  But he was
			  a less sectarian, more revolutionary, more
			  interesting, more suggestive, Kerensky.
			  Count Karolyi was an old agitator for
			  Hungarian nationalism.  A radical agitator
			  emerged from the Hungarian aristocracy, but
			  infected with the Social-Democratic
			  mentality of his time.  An agitator with a
			  romantic temperament, easily inflamed,
			  capable of any bizarre lunacy, and exempt
			  from the mediocre Kerensky's democratic and
			  bourgeois superstitions.

			    <P>The mental and spiritual distance which
			    separates the two figures is rendered more
			    clear and ostensible after their
			    governments than during them.  While
			    Kerensky has not stopped orienting toward
			    the Russian capitalists and even toward
			    the monarchists, Karolyi has, with each
			    passing day, evolved further to the left.
			    So much so that about two years ago he was
			    expelled from Italy, accused of being a
			    Bolshevik agent.  I had the opportunity to
			    meet him in Florence in 1921.  In other
			    words, two and a half years ago.  It was
			    on the eve of the famous Socialist
			    Congress of Livorno, at which the Italian
			    Socialist Party would break apart.

			      <P>C&eacute;sar Falc&oacute;n and I
			      awaited the meeting date for the
			      Congress in Florence, which is no more
			      than four hours from Livorno.  We filled
			      our time visiting Florence's museums,
			      palaces, and churches.  I already knew
			      Florence perfectly.  I served, thus, as
			      chaperone to Falcón, which visited it
			      for the first time.

				<P>One day a journalist friend let us
				know that Count Karolyi was living
				incognito at a Florence boarding
				house.  Naturally, we immediately
				resolved to seek him out; but the
				moment was not a good one for entering
				into relations with the Hungarian
				ex-President.  The newspapermen had
				just discovered his presence incognito
				in Florence and besieged him in order
				to report on him.  Consequently, Count
				Karolyi avoided interviews from
				strangers.  Nonetheless, Falc&oacute;n
				and I managed to speak with him.  We
				chatted extensively about the European
				situation in general and about the
				Hungarian situation in particular.  In
				those days five Hungarian communists
				--Agosto, Nyisz, Sgabado, Bolsamgi,
				and Kalmar-- people's commissars in
				Bela Kun's government had been
				condemned to death by Horthy's
				government.  Karolyi was deeply
				concerned by this news and, since his
				incognito had been violated by several
				journalists, he decided to
				definitively renounce it in order to
				start an international public opinion
				campaign in favor of the former
				Hungarian people's commissars
				condemned to death.

				  <P>He took advantage of all the
				  reports made on him to ask for the
				  intervention of Europe's honest
				  spirits in defense of those noble
				  and heroic lives.  He asked
				  Falcón and I to act in this
				  regard on Spanish journalists.

				    <P>In short, at that time, Karolyi
				    made common cause with the
				    Hungarian communists, in the same
				    way that Kerensky made common
				    cause with the Russian capitalists
				    and even monarchists.

				      <P>This anecdotal note helps to
				      delineate, to define, Karolyi's
				      personality and that is why I
				      have included it in my
				      dissertation.  But let us return
				      now to the ordered story of the
				      Revolution.  Let us examine
				      Karolyi's precarious government.

					<P>The dissimilarity, the
					moral difference, between each
					leader notwithstanding, more
					or less the same thing
					happened to Karolyi's
					government in Hungary as
					happened to Kerenky's
					government in Russia.  It did
					not represent the ideals and
					interests of capitalism, nor
					did it represent the ideals
					and interests of the
					proletariat.

					  <P>The soldiers, back from
					  the front and the war,
					  wanted a bit of land.  The
					  widows and orphans of the
					  fallen and the crippled
					  demanded financial relief
					  from the state.  Karolyi's
					  government could not satisfy
					  either demand because only
					  at the expense of the
					  bourgeoisie, at the expense
					  of capitalism, could it be
					  possible to meet them.
					  However, these unfulfilled
					  demands grew more acute day
					  by day.

					    <P>The Hungarian
					    proletariat was gaining a
					    revolutionary
					    consciousness.  Here and
					    there factory councils
					    sprang up.  The
					    proletariat's left wing
					    broke with the
					    collaborationist social
					    democrats and formed a
					    Communist Party led by
					    Bela Kun.  This Communist
					    Party, like the German
					    Spartacists, preached the
					    carrying out of the
					    maximum program.  Some
					    factories were taken over
					    by workers.  Of course,
					    this mounting
					    revolutionary wave alarmed
					    the reactionary elements
					    to an extreme degree.

					      <P>Capitalism sensed
					      that private ownership
					      of lands and factories
					      was threatened, and
					      quickly and actively
					      organized the reaction.
					      The nobles, the
					      landlords, the military
					      chiefs --in other words,
					      the extreme right--
					      prepared to overthrow
					      Karolyi's weak
					      government, which could
					      not count on the
					      proletarian masses, but
					      also did not adequately
					      guarantee capitalism's
					      safety.

						<P>Simultaneously, the
						international
						situation also
						conspired against
						Karolyi's government.
						Those were the days of
						the armistice and the
						birth of peace.  The
						Allied powers were
						opposed to the
						creation of a strong
						Hugary, or rather,
						were interested in
						that Yugoslavia, on
						the one hand, and
						Czechoslovakia, on the
						other, grow strong at
						Hungary's expense.

						  <P>The nationalist
						  elements demanded
						  from Karolyi a
						  policy of
						  energetically
						  pressing claims.
						  Each loss of
						  territory by Karolyi
						  in the international
						  arena, meant a loss
						  of territory in the
						  terrain of internal
						  politics.

						    <P>And, there came
						    a fatal day for
						    Karolyi's
						    government.  The
						    Allied governments
						    notified him, by
						    way of Lieutenant
						    Colonel Vyx, that
						    the then borders
						    of Hungary should
						    be considered
						    permanent.  These
						    borders meant the
						    loss of enormous
						    tracts for
						    Hungary. Karolyi
						    could not submit
						    to these
						    conditions.  If he
						    had, a chauvinist
						    revolt would have
						    brought him down
						    in a few days.
						    Thus, he had no
						    option left but
						    resignation,
						    stepping down from
						    power, which was
						    immediately seized
						    by the
						    proletariat.
						    Frequently,
						    Karolyi has been
						    accused of handing
						    the government
						    over to the
						    working class.  In
						    reality, however,
						    events were
						    greater than
						    Karolyi's will and
						    to any individual
						    will.  From one
						    side, the
						    reactionary wave,
						    and from the
						    other, the
						    revolutionary
						    wave, both
						    threatened
						    Karolyi's
						    government, which
						    was, consequently,
						    doomed to
						    disappear,
						    swallowed by one
						    or the other.  The
						    reaction and the
						    revolution both
						    prepared for the
						    assault at the
						    same time.  And,
						    well, it was the
						    revolution's hour.
						    Having been opened
						    by Karolyi, the
						    revolutionary
						    period ahd to
						    reach its maximum
						    height, to reach
						    fullness, before
						    starting to
						    decline.  And,
						    when Karolyi
						    resigned the
						    proletariat
						    hurried to take
						    power into its own
						    hands in order to
						    prevent its being
						    mastered by the
						    most retrograde
						    nobility's and
						    bourgeoisie's
						    reaction.

						      <P>Thus emerged
						      the government
						      of Bela Kun.  On
						      21 March, 1919,
						      or more or less
						      five months
						      after the
						      constitution of
						      Karolyi's
						      goverment, the
						      Revolutionary
						      Government
						      Council of the
						      Soviet Hungarian
						      Republic was
						      formed.

							<P>Communists
							and
							social-democrats joined in the creation of this revolutionary government.  And, this is the sign which sets the Hungarian communist revolution apart from the Russian communist revolution.  In Russia, the dictatorship of the proletariat was taken up exclusively by the maximalist party, with the benevolent neutrality of the Left Social-Revolutionaries, but with the Right Social-Revolutionaries' and the Mensheviks' opposition.  In Hungary, by contrast, the dictatorship of the proletariat was exercised by communists and social-democrats jointly.  Aparently, this gave the Hungarian workers' government strength because, by virtue of the agreement between communists and social-democrats, that workers' government represented the unanimity of the proletariat.  Unanimity, plus one.  All the great proletarian tendencies in power; but this was also the Hungarian Soviet Republic's weakness.

							  <P>The
							  Social
							  Democratic
							  Party lacked
							  sufficient
							  revolutionary consciousness.  Its leading body was made up of reformist elements, mentally and spiritually averse to maximalism.  These elements came from the union bureaucracy.  They were old union organizers, grown old in the minimalist and contingent action of union life, superstitiously respectful of the bourgeoisie's strength, deprived of the capacity and will to solidariously collaborate with the maximalists, whom they dismissed as young, inexperienced, and extremist.  Why then, did the Hungarian 

Social Democrats cooperate with, and decisively participate in the revolution?   The explanation lies in Hungary's political situation under Karolyi's government, which I have described earlier.

							    <P>Karolyi's government, in which the Social Democrars participated, was unremittably condemned to fall crushed by the revolution or by the reaction.  The Social Democrats found themselves, then, in need of choosing between the communist revolution and the feudal and aristocratic reaction.  Of course, they had to opt for the communist revolution.  Moreover, they had to hurry it along in order to eliminate the danger of the reaction's gaining time.

							      <P>When
							      Karolyi
							      resigned, the directorate of the Communist Party was in jail.  The Social Democrats and the communist leaders negotiated and agreed amongst themselves, but the  former from the seat of power and the latter from prison.  Around the communist leaders was the majority of the masses, committed to revolution.  The Social Democrats did not give in, then, in the face of the communist leaders; they gave in, in the face of the majority of the proletariat.  Their capitulation was, on the face of it, complete.  The Social Democrats accepted, in its entirety, the carrying out of the communist program.  But they accepted without conviction, without faith, without true moral or mental adherence to it.  They accepted it constrained, pushed, pressed upon, by the circumstances.  In exchange for thei adherence to the communists' program they demanded only the right to participate in its realization.

								<P>They told the communists, "We accept your program, but we want to take part in the government destined to carry it out."   It was a logical demand.  It was a natural demand.  And, it was a legitimate demand.  The communists agreed to it.  That was their first mistake, because, by virtue of the character of the social democratic-communist alliance, Hungary's soviet government turned out to be a hybrid government, a mixed government, a compound government.  This workers' government's program of a uniform hue, but the men charged with carrying it out were of two different hues.   One part of the government truly wanted the carrying out of the program and sensed its historical necessity.   Another part of the government did not intimately believe in the possibility of bringing about that program; it had accepted it with clenched teeth, without optimism, and without confidence.  The Social Democrats, in their majority, saw in the general European revolution the only hope of salvation for the Hungarian proletarian revolution.  They lacked the intellectual and spiritual preparation to defend the Hungarian proletarian revolution, even in the event that the proletariat of the great European powers not answer the call, the incitement, of the Russian Revolution.  This is the spiritual cause, the moral cause, for the end of the dictatorship of the proletariat in Hungary.

								  <P>In spite of the Social Democrats' deaf sabotage, in its rief months of existence Bela Kun's government developed, to a great extent, the proletariat's economic and social program.  It proceeded to the expropriation of the latifundia and landed estates, of the means of production and industrial establishments.  The latifundia and the landed estates, the old property of the Hungarian aristocracy, were given to the peasants, organized into production 

co-operatives.  At the same time, the war's victims --whose demands were not able to be met by the government of Karolyi, impeded by its views and respect for the capitalist order-- were solicitously tended to.  The invalid, the mutilated, widows, orphans, and the unemployed were succored.  The luxury sanatoriums were turned into hospitals for the people.   The aristocrats' palaces, castles, and <EM>chalets</EM> were turned to the lodging of the invalid, of the aged, or of sick proletarian children.  Simultaneously, public education and general culture were reorganized on a class basis, revolutionarily, in order turn them into instruments of socialist education.  And, so that culture, technical ability, once the exclusive patrimony of the bourgeoisie, would be socialized to the benefit the proletariat.

								    <P>But, against Bela Kun's government there conspired, on the one hand, the Social Democrats' skepticism  and resistance, and on the other, the predations of the victorious powers.  The capitalist powers saw in Soviet Hungary a dangerous focus for the propagandization of the communiust idea.  And, they took pains to eliminate it, pushing the neighboring nations --under the victorious entente's tutelage-- against the Hungarian Republic.  

								      <P>In the meantime, the Social Democrats limited and blocked the government's measures against the reactionary preparations and plots.   Esconced within their democratic and liberal prejudices, in their superstition of freedom, the Social Democrats did not allow government to suspend individual liberties for the aristocrats, bourgeois, and conspiratorial military men.  Bela Kun's Minister of Justice was a Social Democrat.  A Social Democrat who seemed more worried about protecting the freedom of counterrevolutionary elements than with defending the revolution's existence.

									<P>The Hungarian Revolution was thus attacked on two fronts: the external front and the internal front.  Externally, it was threatened by the counterrevolutionary intervention of the Allied powers, who economically blockaded Hungary in order to besiege it with hunger.  Internally, it was threatened by Social Democracy's revolutionary unpreparedness, the revolutionary inconstance of one of the bases, one of the fundamental supports of the Revolutions: one of the two governing parties.

									  <P>It was under these conditions that Bela Kun's government, inaugurated on the 21 of March, reached the middle of April.  It was toward mid-April that Romania --one of the Entente's pawns in this great political match-- invaded Hungary.  The Romanian troops took hold of Hungary's best agricultural zone, and they advanced toward the Tibisco River, threatening Budapest.  The moment was critical.  On the 2 of May, Bela Kun explained the situation in a dramatic session of the Budapest Workers' Concil.  He posed the following question: Was it preferrable to organize resistance or was it preferrable to surrender to the Allied powers?  Many Social Democrats spoke in favor of the latter thesis, but the Workers' Council stuck by Bela Kun's thesis.  It was necessary to resist to the very end.  There was alternative but the Revolution's complete victory or complete defeat.  No middle position was possible.  To give in to the capitalist powers would to totally renounce the Revolution and its conquests.  The Workers' Council voted for resistance at all costs, and the government got to work.  The workers of Budapest's factories, the  vanguard of the Hungarian proletariat, constituted a great red army which stopped the Romanians' offensive and inflicted a total defeat upon the Czechoslovakians.  The Hungarian revolutionaries penetrated into Czechoslovakia, occupying a great portion of the Czech territory.  The moment was turning critical for the Allied offensive against Societ Hungary.  Revolutionary seeds were spreading within the Czech army.

									    <P>The astute capitalsit diplomacy then changed tactics.  The Allied powers invited Hungary to withdraw the red army from Czech territory, offering the withdrawal of the Romanian army from occupied territory beyond the Tibisco Roiver as compensation.  The Social Democrats spoke out for the acceptance of this proposal and took advantage of the unpopularity of the carrying out the war within the spirits of the proletariat, worn down after five years of war-related travails.  The communists could not energetically counteract this propaganda.  The Communist Party's most numerous and combative elements were absent from Budapest, having voluntarily enrolled in the red army.  The vanguard of the Budapest proletariat was at the front, battling against the Revolution's external enemies.  Under the influence of Budapest's social democratic atmosphere, the government and the Council of Soviets thus ended up leaning toward the Allied proposal.   The red army, unhappy and depressed in its combative will, withdrew from Czechoslovakia.  But, its sacrifice was for naught, as the Allied powers did not, for their part, keep their agreement.  The Romanians did not withdraw from Hungarian territory.

									      <P>This deception, this failure, greatly disheartened the Hungarian proletariat, whose revolutionary faith was sapped, on the other hand, by the defeatist propaganda of the Social Democrats, who began to secretly work out a negotiated solution with the Allied powers' diplomatic representatives.  

										<P>The reaction, in the meantime, readied itself to seize power.  On the 24 of June, reactionary elements, joined by three hundred students from the former military academy, took control of the Danube's lookouts.  This sedition was put down, but the revolutionary tribunals treated the rebels with excessive generosity.  The three hundred rebel student officers were pardoned.  Thirteen instigators and organizers of the insurrection were sentenced to death, but, giving in to pressure from the Allied diplomatic missions, they too ended up being released.

										  <P>The communist regime, in the meantime, kept on struggling against enormous difficulties.  Provisions were scarce due, on the one hand, to the blockade, and on the other, to the Romanian occupation of the Tibisco's fertile agricultural region.  The available foodstuffs did not suffice to supply the entire populace.  This scarcity contributed to creating an air of discontent and distrust toward the communist regime.  Bela Kun's government then decided to attempt an offensive against the Romanians in order to dislodge them from the lands beyond the Tibisco.  But this offensive, begun on July 20, did not succeed.  The red army, disheartened by so many disappointments, was repulsed and defeated by the Romanian army.  This military setback condemned the communist regime to death.

										    <P>The social democratic and union leaders entered into formal peace talks with Allied diplomatic missions.   These missions promised recognition for a social democratic government.  In sum, they put the elimination of the communists and the destruction of their work as the price of peace.

										      <P>The Social Democratic Party and the unions, with the illusion that a social democratic government --protected by the Allied diplomatic missions-- could hold on to power, accepted the Entente's conditions. Thus fell the government of Bela Kun.

											<P>On August 2, the Council of Peoples Commissars abdicated command.  It was replaced by a social democratic government.  This social democratic government, in order to contain and satisfy the Allied powers, repealed the communist government's laws.  It reestablished private property of factories, latifundia, and landed estates.  It reestablished freedom of trade and returned the bourgeois administration's functionaries and employees to their posts.  In short, it reestablished the capitalist order.  But, with all that, this social democratic government lasted but three days.  With the defeat of the Revolution, power inevitably had to fall into the reaction's hands, and so it was.  The social democratic government lasted but the time necessary for the abolition of communist legislation and for the aristocracy, militarism, and capitalism to organize the attempt to seize of power.

											  <P>The Social Democrats were unable to resist the reactionary wave.  They could not even count on the no-longer fooled masses of the democratic government from its first moment of life, since it undertook the destruction of the revolution's work.  They had to fall at the reactionary's first onslaught.

											    <P>Thus ended the communist regime in Hungary.  Thus was born the reactionary regime of Admiral Horthy.  Thus began the Hungarian proletariat's martyrdom.  Never was a proletarian revolution punished so cruelly, so brutally repressed.  Horthy's government lent itself, body and soul, to the persecution of all those citizens who had participated in the communist administration.  The white terror struck Hungary like a terrible whip.  It turned first against the communists, then on the Social Democrats, and later on against the Hebrews, Masons, Protestants, and finally against even the bourgeois suspected of excessive liberal and democratic devotion.  But it threw itself, above all, against the proletariat.  The cities and towns guilty of revolutionary enthusiasm under the communist government were horrifically punished.

											      <P>In the regions beyond the Danube some locales, marked by their communist sentiment, were truly depopulated.  Innumerable workers were shot or massacred, others were jailed, and others forced to emmigrate to escape the analogous punishments o constant mistreatments.  Every day, there arrived in Austria, in Italy, numerous contingents of escapees, armies of workers who left Hungary fleeing from the white terror.  Vienna was full of Hungarian refugees.  And in almost all the main Italian cities through which I traveled at that time, the Hungarian refugees were also legion.

												<P>All description of the white terror in Hungary will always pale in comparison with reality.

												  <P>From August 1919, in Hungary there have followed shootings, drawing-and-quartering, jailings, arson, mutilations, looting, as means of repression and punishment of the proletariat.   It has been necessary that the reactionaries' thirst for blood ease and that a cry of horror from civilized men of Europe still it, for the crimes and persecutions diminish and become rare. 

												    <P>I have on hand a book which contains some tales of the white terror in Hungary.

												      <P>But these tales could seem exagerated to the bourgeois' hearts.  It will be said that this is an Italian version and that the Italians are always, as good Italians, excessive and passionate in their impressions.

													<P>But it happens that the same things, more or less, have been told by a commission of the <EM>Trade Unions</EM><A NAME="*" HREF="#n*">*</A> and the English Labour Party, which visited Hungary in May 1920, to directly find out what was happening there.  The British commission's finding is one of executed circumspection, and, even more, it is the finding of a commission of very measured, very grave, and very conscientious people from the <EM>Trade Unions</EM> and the <EM>Labour Party</EM><A NAME="**" HREF="#n**">**</A>.

													  <P>The English delagtion was made up of Colonel Wedgwood, member of the House of Commons, and four distinguished members of the <EM>Trade Unions'</EM> and <EM>Labour Party's</EM> bureacracy.  Naturally, the delegation could not visit all of Hungary.  It visited but Budapest and one or another important township.

													    <P>During its visit, moreover, there was a prudent truce of the white terror.  Horthy's reactionary government tried to cover things up as much as possible.  The delagtions means of information were, in short, limited and insufficient for learning the true magnitude, the true reality of the terrorism of Horthy's bands.

													      <P>Consequently, the English Commission's finding is but a pale, a benevolent, narration of Hungarian events.  It sins in moderation, in optimism, but it nonetheless corroborates the affirmations of the book from which I have just read a page.  According to the commission's calculations, at the time at which it was in Hungary, the number of political prisoners and detainees was at least twelve thousand.  According to official information there were six thousand.  Horthy's government was admitting that it had six thousand people imprisoned for political reasons. In its report, the Comission tells that it had been assured that the total number of people arrested or detained was above 25,000.

														<P>The British Commission's report contains severl atrocious anecdotes of the white terror in Hungary.  I will read one of them so that you will be able to form an idea of the ferocity with which the members and functionaries of the communist goverment, and even their relatives, were persecuted.

														  <P>Such is the case of Mrs. Hamburger.  The Commission's report says thusly:

														    <P>[Reads from report.]

														      <P>Why continue? You already know how the red "terror" behaved in Hungary.  You already know many things which have been told to us by the newspapers' cablegrams, so prodigal in horrific details when it comes to narrating a death by firing squad in Soviet Russia.

															<P>Horthy's government resembles a frightening mission from the Middle Ages. It is not in vain that its characteristics are, precisely, those of attempting to re-establish medievalism and feudalism in Hungary.  The reaction in Hungary is not only the enemy of socialism and the revolutionary proletariat.  It is also the enemy of industrial capitalism.  Because industrial capitalism, the factories, and large industry give rise to the industrial proletariat, the organized proletariat in the city --that is, the instrument of social revolution-- the Hungarian reaction instinctively detests industrial capitalism, the large factories, large industry.  Horthy's government is the despotic and bloodthirsty rule of agricultural feudalism, of the landlords and latifundists.  Horthy governs Hungary with the title of Regent because for the reaction Hungary continues to be a kingdom.  A kingdom without a king, but a kingdom still.

															  <P>A year and a half ago, as you will remember, Charles of Autria, ex-Emperor of Austro-Hungary, son of Franz Joseph, was called on by the Hungarian monarchists to reestablish the monarchy in Hungary.  The plan failed because the reestablishment of the Hapsburg dynasty, of the old ruling house of Austro-Hungary, was opposed by all the nations made independent as a result of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, who feared that, once installed in Hungary, the monarchy would end up establishing the old Empire.

															    <P>It failed, also, because Italy, alarmed at the possibility of the rebirth of the Asutro-Hungarian Empire, opposed the reestablishment of the monarchy in Hungary for the same reasons.

															      <P>All these nations opposed their veto to placing Charles back on the throne in Hungary.  Lastly, against this ressumption were the non-aristocratic peasants, opposed to socialism but equally opposed to the old order.

																<P>That is why today we do not have a Hungary transformed into an absolute, medieval, and feudal, monarchy with a king at the head.  But, in fact, the regime of Regent Horthy is an absolute, medieval, and feudal regime.  It is the domination of the great estates over indsutry, the domination of the countryside over the city.  As a result of this regime, Hungary is impoverished.  Its depreciatd money lacks hope of convalescence and stabilization.   The poverty of the intelectual and manual proletariat is apocalyptic.  A journalist told me in Budapest, in June of last year, that in this city there were people who could eat only every other day, one day yes, one day no.  This poor journalist, who no doubt was a privileged being next to other intelectual workers, seemed afflicted by hunger and misery.

																  <P>I later met an intellectual, the author of several studies on musical aesthetics, who served as doorman in a house in the neighborhood. Poverty had forced him to accept the role of doorman.  Such is the economic order, the consequences of the reaction and white terror.

																    <P>But a period of reaction, a period of absolutism, cannot be but a transitory, temporary period.

																      <P>A contemporary nation, and much less an European nation, cannot return to primitive and barbarian way of life.  A resurrection of feudalism and medievalism cannot be longlasting.  The necessities of modern life, the tendency of the productive forces, the relation with other nations, do not allow the regression by a people to an anti-industrial nor antiproletarian order.

																	<P>Gradually, the proletarian movement is reviving in Hungary.  The Social Democratic Party and the unions again win their right to a legal existence.

																	  <P>Into the Hungarian parliament have gone some socialist deputies, but timidly socialist in the end.

																	    <P>The Communist Party, condemned to an illegal and clandestine life, silently prepares the hour of its re-emergence.  Some democratic or liberal elements of the bourgeoisie also begin to move and polarize.  Fearful of this rebirth of proletarian forces and of democratic forces, a fascist band has been organized in Hungary.  Its headman is the famous reactionary Friedrich.  It is all symptomatic.

																	      <P>As I have already said about the German Revolution, a revolution is not a coup d'etat, it is not an insurrection, it is not one of those things which we here call a revolution from arbitrary use of the word.  A revolution does not take place but over many years, and frequently it has alternating periods of predominance by revolutionary forces and of predominance by counterrevolutionary forces.

																		<P>Just as a war is a process of offensives and counteroffensives, of voctories and defeats, while one of the combatant groups does not definitively capitulate, while it does not give up its struggle, it is not defeated.  Its defeat is transitory, but not total.  In accordance with this interpretation of history, the reaction, the white terror, Horthy's government, are but an unpleasant chapter of the Hungarian Revolution.

																		  <P>This chapter will some day come to its final page.  Then, there will begin another chapter, a chapter which may be the chapter of the Hungarian proletariat's victory.

																		    <P>Horthy's government is, for the Hungarian proletariat, a dark night, a painful nightmare.  But this dark night, this painful nightmare, will pass.  Then will come the dawn.

																				  <P>Next Friday, in accordance with the program of this course of lectures, I will talk about the Conference and the treaty of the Versailles Peace.  I will give the history, explanation, and critique of that peace treaty which, as you know, has not resulted in a treaty for peace but a treaty for war.

																				    <P>I will lay out the moral physiognomy, the ideological profile, of that document, still fresh, and already totally discredited, grave and headstone for President Wilson's candid democratic illusions.
