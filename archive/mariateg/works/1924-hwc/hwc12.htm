<p class="fst">Author&#8217;s Notes:
	<P>The symptoms of a crisis of the democratic order could be
	felt since before the war. What has driven this crisis?
	Capitalism's and the proletariat's parallel increase and
	concentration. Economic life, the economic forces of the
	countries, have passed into the hands of these two great
	powers, beside which the State has acquires a role, not as
	arbiter, but as mediator. The conflicts, the contrasts between
	one force and the other, have not been able to be solved by
	State save by deals, direct agreements between them. In those
	deals, the State has but played the role of mender. Within the
	old society's forms the forms of a new society were
	incubated. The nation, by virtue of the new social reality,
	has ceased to be a predominantly political entity, to become a
	predominantly economic entity. This change in the nation's
	substance has determined the crisis of the political
	State. History shows us that a society's forms of social and
	political organization correspond with the structire, with the
	tendency of the productive forces. Bourgeois society, for
	example, no origin other than the birth of industry. Within
	Medieval society, the bouegoisie was the industrial class, the
	artisan class. As the bourgeoise grew richer, as industry
	grew, the privileges of the aristrocracy, of the nobility,
	became unbearable. The laborer and the bourgeois were mixed at
	that time into a single class: the people. The bourgeoisie was
	the people's vanguard and it was the class which led the
	revolution. Laborer and bourgeois coincided in the wish to
	abolish the aristocracy's privileges. Thus, the fall of the
	aristocracy, of the Medieval order, more than by abstract
	reasons of ideology, was determined by concrete reasons in the
	emergence of a new form of production: industry. New forms of
	production have been created under the democratic order, the
	bourgeois order. Industry has developed extraordinarily,
	pushed along by the machine. Huge industrial enterprises have
	emerged. The expansion of these new productive forces does not
	allow the old political molds to endure. It has transformed
	the structure of nations and demands a transformation in the
	democratic order's structure. Bourgeois democracy has ceased
	to correspond with the organization of the productive forces
	which have changed and grown formidably. That's why democracy
	is in crisis. Democracy's typical institution is the
	parliament. The crisis of democracy is a crisis of
	parliament. We have already seen how the two great
	contemporary forces are capital and labor and how, beyond
	parliament, these forces clash or struggle. Democracy's
	theorists might suppose that these forces are, or should be,
	proportionaly represented in parliament. But it is not
	so. Because society is not split cleanly between capitalists
	and proletarians. Between the capitalist class and the
	proletarian class there are a series of amorphous and
	intermediary layers. Besides, just as the whole proletarian
	class does not have a precise awareness of its historical and
	class necessities, the whole of the capitalist class is not
	gifted with a precise class consciousness. The mentality of
	the big industrialist or the banker is not the same as the
	mentality of the medium rentier or retail merchant. This
	disperison of social classes is reflected in parliament which
	thus does not exactly reflect the large interests in play. The
	political State turns out to be the representation of the all
	the social layers. But the conservative force and the
	revolutionary force polarize into singular interest groupings:
	capitalism and proletariat. Within the parliamentary order
	there cannot be but coalition governments. Today, the tendency
	is toward factional governments.</P>

	<P>Currently, the intensification of the class struggle, the
	expansion of social warfare, has accented this crisis of
	democracy.  The proletariat attempts the decisive assault on
	the State and political power in order to transform
	society. Its growth in the parliaments is threatening to the
	bourgeoisie.  Democracy's legal instruments have turned out to
	be insufficient for preserving the democratic order.
	Conservatism has needed to turn to illegal action, to
	extra-legal methods.  The middle class, society's intermediate
	and heterogeneous zone, has been the nerve center of this
	movement.  Lacking a class consciousness of its own, the
	middle class feels itself equally distant from, and inimical
	to capitalism and the proletariat.  But within it are
	represented some capitalist sectors.  And, as the current
	battle is waged between capital and the proletariat, all
	intervention from a third element must operate to the benefit
	of the conservative class.  Capitalism and the proletariat are
	two great and singular camps of gravitation which draw-in the
	scattered forces.  Whosoever reacts against the proletariat
	serves capitalism.  This falls to the middle class, from whose
	ranks the fascist movement has recruited its proselytism.
	Fascism is not an Italian phenomenon, it is an international
	phenomenon.  The first European country in which fascism
	appeared was Italy because in Italy the class struggle was in
	a sharper period, because in Italy the revolutionary situation
	was most violent and decisisve.</P>
