<p>Although I am not a highly-autobiographical writer, I will myself give
you some summary information. I was born in &#8216;95. At 14 years of age I got
into a newspaper as an assistant. Until 1919 I worked in daily journalism,
first in &#8220;La Prensa,&#8221; later in &#8220;El Tiempo,&#8221; and lastly in &#8220;La Razon.&#8221; In
this last daily we promoted the university reform movement. From 1918,
nauseated by Creole politics, I turned resolutely toward socialism, breaking
with my first attempts being a literato full of fin-de-siecle decadence
and Byzantinism, then in full bloom. From late 1919 to mid-1923 I traveled
through Europe. I lived more than two years in Italy, where I married a
woman and some ideas. I traveled through France, Germany, Austria, and
other countries. My wife and child prevented me from reaching Russia. From
Europe I joined with some Peruvians for socialist action. My articles from
that period mark the stations of my socialist orientation. Upon my return
to Peru, in 1923, in reports, in lectures in the Student Federation, in
the People&#8217;s University, in articles, etc., I explained the European situation
and began my work of investigating national reality following the Marxist
method. In 1924 I was, as I have already told you, near to losing my life.
I lost a leg and was left very delicate of health. I would surely have
already recovered entirely with a restful existence. However, neither my
poverty nor my spiritual restlessness permit it. I have not published any
more books than those you already know. I have two ready and, in-progress,
two more. That is my life in few words. I do not believe that it would
be worth making notable; but, I cannot refuse you the information you request.
I forgot: I am self-taught. I once enrolled in Letters in Lima, but only
with interest in taking an erudite Augustine&#8217;s Latin course. And, in Europe
I freely attended some courses, but without ever deciding to lose my extra-collegiate,
and perhaps anti-collegiate, status. In 1925, the Student Federation nominated
me to the University as an instructor in the field that is my specialty;
but the Rector&#8217;s ill-will and, probably, my state of health, frustrated
that initiative.

to Enrique Espinoza (a.k.a. Samuel Glusberg), editor of the Buenos Aires
journal &#8220;La Vida Literaria.&#8221; The letter was published for the first time
in the May 1930 issue of that magazine, after Mariategui&#8217;s death.]</P>
