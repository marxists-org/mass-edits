    <h3>A South American revolutionary</h3>

    <h1>Jose Carlos Mari&#225;tegui and Peruvian socialism</h1>

    <p><em>By <a href="http://redsites.alphalink.com.au/writings.htm">TOM
    O&#8217;LINCOLN</a>. A slightly different version appeared in</em>
    Socialist Review <em>No 2, Melbourne, Winter, 1990.</em></p>

    <p>Jose Carlos Mari&#225;tegui seems to be little known outside Latin
    America. Yet in that region, he holds an important place in revolutionary
    history.</p>

    <p>The official Communist Party of Peru claims his legacy, on the grounds
    that he was its virtual founder. The ferocious Shining Path guerrilla
    movement derives its nickname from a professed commitment to the
    &#8220;shining path of Jose Carlos Mari&#225;tegui&#8221;. Another left
    party, formed by the fusion of several groups in 1984, took the name United
    Mariateguista Party.</p>

    <p>Others claim him as well, incuding the bourgeois nationalist Aprista
    party. So his closest collaborators made a strong statement immediately
    after his death to clarify where he really stood:</p>

    <p class="quote">Mari&#225;tegui was not an &#8220;intellectual&#8221; but
    a proletarian ideologist, a revolutionary, a marxist of the Third
    International, know it once and for all, esteemed Messrs petty bourgeois
    intellectuals. In the struggle we must wage &#8211; we will defend his
    heritage which belongs to the worker, the peasant, and the revolutionary
    intellectual. (1)</p>

    <p>In Latin America he is widely regarded as one of the great Marxists.
    This is partly because that continent, despite its revolutionary
    traditions, has produced few major Marxist theoreticians. The Mexican
    writer Jose Aric&#243; wrote in 1978 that Mari&#225;tegui's major work on
    Peruvian society &#8220;remains, fifty years after its publication, the
    only really significant theoretical work of Latin American Marxism&#8221;.
    (2)</p>

    <p>Mari&#225;tegui was born in the town of Moquegua in 1894. When his
    father abandoned the family, he and his mother were plunged into poverty.
    He was unable to pursue his schooling beyond the age of 15, and had to
    enter the printing trade. Within a short time he had worked his way off the
    shop floor and into journalism. In 1914 he published his first item of
    artistic criticism under the pseudonym &#8220;Juan Croniqueur.&#8221;</p>

    <p>While his early interests were artistic, and he also showed a talent for
    racing coverage, he was drawn more and more toward political journalism. In
    1916 he left his first employer to join a new daily, <em>El Tiempo</em>,
    which had a more leftist orientation. Two years later he launched his own
    magazine, only to find that the owners of <em>El Tiempo</em> refused to
    print it. This led him to break with <em>El Tiempo</em> and launch a
    newspaper called <em>La Raz&#243;n</em>, which became his first major
    venture in leftwing journalism.</p>

    <p>The new paper waged a vigorous defence of the campaign then underway for
    reform of the universities, and went on to become a tribunal for the
    defence of the young labour movement. <em>La Raz&#243;n</em> supported a
    strike for the eight-hour day held in May 1919, and it reported its
    editor&#8217;s speech at a workers&#8217; demonstration:</p>

    <p class="quote">JC Mari&#225;tegui, acclaimed by the demonstrators, rose
    to speak. He said that for the second time the writers of <em>La
    Raz&#243;n</em> had had their spirits raised by a visit from the people;
    that <em>La Raz&#243;n</em> was a newspaper of the people and for the
    people. (3)</p>

    <p>The paper&#8217;s aggressive radicalism brought it into conflict with
    the government. It was rumoured that the ruling circles offered
    Mari&#225;tegui a choice: either go to jail, or travel to Europe with
    government assistance. At any rate, he departed precipitately for Europe in
    1919.</p>

    <p>The first World War had ended only a year before. At first
    Mari&#225;tegui, like many young South Americans of his time, had placed
    his hopes in the democratic ideals professed by Woodrow Wilson, but by late
    1919 the <em>realpolitik</em> of the Versailles treated had exploded such
    hopes. By this time he was more attracted to the two great revolutions of
    the age, those in Mexico and Russia. His arrival in Europe brought him
    immediately into intellectual circles close to the Communist
    International.</p>

    <p>In France he established relations with the writers around the journal
    <em>Clart&#233;</em> edited by Henri Barbusse. But for health reasons he
    had to proceed quite soon to Italy. It was the experience of Italian
    Communism and Italian fascism which decisively shaped his thought.</p>

    <p>He was in Italy during the great Turin factory occupations of 1920, and
    in January 1921 he was present at the Livorno Congress of the Socialist
    Party, where the historic split occurred that led to the formation of the
    Communist Party. By the time he left the country in 1922, Mussolini was
    already on his way to power.</p>

    <p>The Italian experience brought Mari&#225;tegui some important insights.
    The first was the obvious crisis of Italian liberalism. The old methods of
    bourgeois politics were proving utterly ineffectual in the face of the
    postwar crisis. The only serious alternatives before society were socialism
    or fascism. And while this catastrophic situation did not apply immediately
    to Peru, he did take home with him the conviction that the lived in an age
    when bourgeois politics were bankrupt.</p>

    <p>In the 1920s Mari&#225;tegui advanced a fairly sophisticated analysis of
    fascism that in some ways foreshadowed Trotsky&#8217;s. He recognised that
    fascism was a response to deep social crisis, that it based itself on the
    petty bourgeoisie of town and country, that it relied heavily on a cult of
    violence. And he understood that fascism was the price that a society in
    crisis paid for the failures of the left:</p>

    <p class="quote">Italian fascism represents, clearly, the anti-revolution
    or, as it is usually called, the counter-revolution. The fascist offensive
    is explained, and is realised in Italy, as a consequence of a retreat or a
    defeat of the revolution. (4)</p>

    <p>He responded to the whole Italian experience by forming a permanent
    commitment to the Communist movement, which he saw as the only serious
    force holding out hope for progress in an age of world crisis.</p>

    <p>Mari&#225;tegui was deeply concerned about the d&#233;bacle of reformist
    socialism after 1914, and appalled at the way the established socialist
    leaders had betrayed the workers of Turin:</p>

    <p class="quote">The survival of the reformist spirit in the majority of
    functionaries and leaders of the Italian proletariat &#8211; was obvious
    &#8211; The revolution was sabotaged by its leaders." (5)</p>

    <p>He concluded that independent Communist organisation was essential, and
    he was instrumental in forming the first Peruvian Communist cell, along
    with three countrymen, in Rome in 1921-22. It was shortlived, however, as
    he left Italy soon afterwards.</p>

    <p>Return to Peru</p>

    <p>Mari&#225;tegui had ardently hoped to visit the Soviet Union. But family
    commitments (he married an Italian woman, Ana Chiappe, and fathered a
    child) along with his chronically poor health rendered the trip impossible.
    After a tour through northern Europe, where he was struck by the poverty he
    found in Austria and Germany, he returned to Peru in March, 1923.</p>

    <p>He was soon invited to lecture at the new &#8220;Popular
    University&#8221; by nationalist leader Haya de la Torre. Here he delivered
    a series of presentations on the &#8220;History of the World Crisis",
    dealing primarily with Europe, in which he made explicit his orientation to
    the working class:</p>

    <p class="quote">Above all, I dedicate my lectures to this vanguard of the
    Peruvian proletariat. No one needs to study the world crisis more than the
    proletarian vanguard groups. I don&#8217;t come to this free tribunal of a
    free university to teach you the history of the world crisis, but to study
    it alongside you. (6)</p>

    <p>In these lectures Mari&#225;tegui argued that world capitalism was in
    terminal decline and that Peru, as a colony of imperialism, would be
    decisively affected. Within this crisis a new civilisation was working its
    way to the surface. &#8220;According to all indications, the proletarian,
    socialist civilisation is destined to succeed the declining, decadent
    moribund capitalist civilisation.&#8221; (7) But this could only happen if
    the workers were armed with a correct political orientation, he continued.
    Before the war, the European labour movement had been divided between
    reformist socialism and revolutionary socialism. In the postwar era the
    division was between reformists and revolutionary Communists, and the
    workers must follow the Communists.</p>

    <p>He also turned his hand to journalism, writing sketches of international
    celebrities under the title &#8220;Figures and Aspects of the World Scene",
    discussing Mussolini, Lloyd George, Poincar&#233; but also Lenin and
    Trotsky.</p>

    <p>In this period, following the call of the Fourth Congress of the
    Communist International, Mari&#225;tegui campaigned in the workers&#8217;
    movement to create a United Front. And while he was careful to insist that
    the United Front did not mean any submerging of distinctive politics, he
    nevertheless was prepared to engage in practical collaboration even with
    the Aprista party. It seems Mari&#225;tegui feared that any premature
    founding of a socialist or Communist party would only lead to it being
    crushed by state repression.</p>

    <p>In 1926 he launched his most famous publication, the journal
    <em>Amauta</em>. In its pages he was to publish the articles about Peruvian
    society which are his main theoretical legacy. Even now, he did not declare
    the journal a socialist publication in very explicit terms:</p>

    <p class="quote">This review &#8211; does not represent a group. It
    represents rather a movement, a spirit. Peru has felt, for some time, the
    existence of a current of renewal, which grows daily more vigorous and
    defined. The authors of this renewal are called vanguardists, socialist,
    revolutionaries, etc. History has not yet baptised them definitively &#8211;
    What they have in common [is the desire] to create a new Peru as part of a
    new world. (8)</p>

    <p>When reproached with the sometimes heternogeneous nature of the
    journal&#8217;s content, he replied that the sense of direction shared by
    its central collaborators would protect it against losing its way. And
    indeed by 1928 <em>Amauta</em> was ready to be more explicit about its
    politics:</p>

    <p class="quote">On our banner we inscribe this single, simple and great
    word: Socialism. With this motto we affirm our absolute independence from
    the idea of a Nationalist Party, petty bourgeois and demagogic. (9)</p>

    <p>The second sentence was a declaration that Mari&#225;tegui was breaking
    relations with the Aprista nationalists. At this time he also decided it
    was time to do some intense organising. In 1929 he assisted in the
    formation of the General Confederation of Labour, whose main organised
    strength was in Lima and its port of Callao, and sent a number of his
    collaborators to attend the Latin American Trade Union Congress sponsored
    by the Communist International. In the same year he initiated the formation
    of the Socialist Party of Peru.</p>

    <p>He argued, successfully or so it seemed, for the formation of a
    socialist rather than a Communist Party. A debate has long raged about his
    grounds for doing so. Part of his reasoning was simply pragmatic: he felt
    that a party calling itself &#8220;socialist&#8221; might not face as much
    repression. Some writers have argued that there was little more involved
    than this. Guillermo Rouillon contends that after somoe initial factional
    problems,</p>

    <p class="quote">the party soon achieved with the guidance of Jose Carlos a
    monolithic organisation, and consequently the Bolshevik temper which
    characterized the Communist Party of Marxist-Leninist tendency. (19)</p>

    <p>Others suggest Mari&#225;tegui was striving for a party less sectarian
    and less elitist than was intended by the Comintern, which was caught up at
    the time in its ultra-left &#8220;Third Period&#8221;. Jose Aric&#243;
    argues:</p>

    <p class="quote">The socialist definition of the party was not a simple
    problem of nomenclature. It was connected to: 1) a particular conception of
    alliances; 2) a differing view on its class components from that of the
    Comintern &#8211;; 3) a rather heterodox vision of the process of
    constituting it &#8211; before being the originator, it had to be result of
    the actions of groups at the base. (11)</p>

    <p>The Catalan socialist Josep Ferrer contends:</p>

    <p class="quote">Mariategui conceived the idea of a party with a wide base,
    though with a disciplined Communist leadership, embracing both the working
    class and the peasantry, in open opposition to the Comintern thesis which
    called for organising solely the proletariat. (12)</p>

    <p>It seems clear that Mari&#225;tegui sought to build a revolutionary
    party, and that he had differences with the international movement, but the
    details are unlikely never to be entirely clarified, for lack of a clear
    statement from him about his views and intentions.</p>

    <p>(Shortly after his death, the party overturned its previous decision and
    re-named itself Communist. It then engaged in ultra-left adventures that
    cost it dearly.)</p>

    <p>By the end of the twenties, Mari&#225;tegui had completed two
    significant theoretical works. One was his <em>Seven Essays of
    Interpretation of Peruvian Reality</em>, of which the most important dealt
    with economic history and the situation of the Indian peoples. The other
    was his <em>Defence of Marxism</em>.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, there were to be no more. Mari&#225;tegui had been in
    poor health most of his life, losing a leg in 1924. In 1930 he became
    gravely ill and died. Groups of workers attended his body all night, and on
    the following day the trade unions supervised his burial. A multitude of
    workers raised the red flag and sang the <em>Internationale</em>. He was
    saluted by his saddened admirers as "the teacher, the artist and the most
    noble friend of the workers&#8221;. (13) And the remaining editors of
    <em>Amauta</em> declared:</p>

    <p class="quote">Mari&#225;tegui, his memory, his life, his work belong to
    the proletariat &#8211; His life is our example, his work an unbreakable
    affirmation, his cadaver a protest. (14)</p>

    <p>Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s Marxism</p>

    <p>Mari&#225;tegui described himself as &#8220;a man with an allegiance and
    a faith&#8221; (15) and explained them in these words:</p>

    <p class="quote">My sympathies are not with one nation or another. My
    sympathies are with the universal proletariat &#8211; my temperament is a
    polemical temperament, belligerent and combative &#8211; I don&#8217;t
    aspire to the title of an impartial man because on the contrary I pride
    myself on my partisanship, which places my thought, my opinions and my
    sentiments on the side of those who want to construct, on the ruins of the
    old society, the harmonious edifice of the new. (16)</p>

    <p>As so much of his intervention in that struggle was intellectual, the
    roots and characteristics of his Marxist theoretical method assume a
    considerable importance. Mari&#225;tegui came to Marxism in Italy. His
    intellectual "universe&#8221; contained many of the same influences as that
    of Antonio Gramsci and the early Italian Communists. He was actually
    introduced to the works of Marx by the philosopher Benedetto Croce, whom he
    got to know personally in the house of his wife&#8217;s family. Croce was
    influenced by the syndicalist writer Georges Sorel, with whom he had worked
    at one time. The combined influence of Crocean &#8220;idealist
    Marxism&#8221; and Sorel&#8217;s ideas on the role of myth gave
    Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s own thought a definite flavour. He writes at times
    about the socialist program as a &#8220;myth&#8221; in the Sorelian sense;
    his works are oftened with words such as &#8220;faith", &#8220;agony",
    "mystique"; and he displays an openness to many non-Marxist currents of
    thought such as Freud. For example:</p>

    <p class="quote">The struggle for socialism raises the workers, who take
    part it in with extreme energy and absolute conviction, to an ascetism such
    that it is totally ridiculous to throw their materialist creed into their
    faces in the name of a theoretical and philosophical morality &#8211; The
    materialist, if he professes and serves his faith religiously, can only by
    a linguistic convention be distinguished from and counterposed to an
    idealist. (17)</p>

    <p>Statements of this sort have been seized on by non-socialist critics and
    used to argue that Mari&#225;tegui wasn&#8217;t really a Marxist. These
    arguments, however, are based on a narrow view of Marxism. The statement
    quoted is remiscent of Lenin&#8217;s view that &#8220;intelligent idealism
    is nearer to intelligent materialism than is stupid materialism.&#8221;
    (18) It must also be seen within the context of his work as a whole, in
    which there is no shortage of statements affirming his agreement with
    classical Marxism and with Bolshevism.</p>

    <p>For example the statement &#8220;Programmatic Principles of the
    Socialist Party", drafted for the party&#8217;s organising committee in
    1928, refers to the &#8220;international character of the modern
    economy&#8221; which makes national solutions to the capitalist crisis
    unviable, to the need for a world revolutionary movement, and to the
    imperialist stage in the development of capitalism. &#8220;The practice of
    Marxist socialism in this period is that of Marxism-Leninism.
    Marxism-Leninism is the revolutionary method of the stage of imperialism
    and monopolies. The Socialist Party of Peru adopts it as its method of
    struggle.&#8221; (19)</p>

    <p>His most substantial work dealing with theoretical method is his
    <em>Defence of Marxism</em>, written in 1928. At the time he felt a need to
    put his views into coherent form, not least because of the attacks on
    Marxism he had experienced in Peru. He seized upon the appearance of Henri
    de Man&#8217;s book <em>Beyond Marxism</em> as a suitable opportunity.</p>

    <p>Henri de Man was a Belgian Social Democrat who became disillusioned with
    the Marxism he was familiar with, turning instead towards psychologies of
    social change (the German edition of his book was called <em>On the
    Psychology of Socialism</em>). De Man located the main source of the class
    struggle in a "social inferiority complex&#8221; suffered by the working
    class, arguing that what the workers resented about the bourgeoisie was
    less their wealth than their power. In the course of his work de Man struck
    telling blows against vulgar materialism (a revolutionary workers&#8217;
    movement should indeed focus more on the issue of power than on the wealth
    of the ruling class) and against social democratic reformism, whose
    theoretical poverty he exposed. Mari&#225;tegui is quick to point out that
    &#8220;the most important thing about <em>Beyond Marxism</em> is
    undoubtedly its critique of reformist politics.&#8221; (20)</p>

    <p>At the same time, however, de Man raised numerous mistaken criticisms of
    Marxism itself. He accused it of mechanical determinism, of lacking moral
    strength, of ignoring the psychological dimension. Mari&#225;tegui seeks to
    refute the charges, and in doing so confronts not only the work of de Man
    but also other writers including Max Eastman and Emile Vandervelde.</p>

    <p>His starting point is the charge of economic determinism. The economic
    question is at the heart of the Marxist method, Mari&#225;tegui writes, and
    a "revision, let alone a liquidation of Marxism that does not attempt first
    of all a documented and original correction of Marxist economics is
    inconceivable." (21) This however is a general question of method, and not
    a matter of crude and automatic correlations. The Marxist method
    &#8220;only seeks the economic causes in the last analysis&#8221;. (22) We
    shall see in discussing his work on Peruvian society that he pays
    considerable regard to that &#8220;last analysis", but at this point he is
    concerned to refute the accusation that Marx saw economic factors as
    automatically determining consciousness and events:</p>

    <p class="quote">Marx &#8211; took to its limits his demonstration that the
    process of capitalist economy itself, where most fully and vigorously
    carried out, leads to socialism; but he understood always as a prior
    condition of the new order, the spiritual and intellectual training of the
    proletariat to realise it, through the class struggle. (23)</p>

    <p>Mari&#225;tegui quotes an unnamed friend as worrying that Marxism is not
    spiritual enough, and makes an indignant reply:</p>

    <p class="quote">Do those who aspire to a spiritualisation of Marxism
    believe that the creative spirit is less present and active in the actions
    of those who struggle in the world for a new social order than in the
    moneylenders or industrialists of New York who, in a case of capitalist
    weariness, abandon a strong Nietzschean ethic &#208; the sublimated
    morality of capitalism &#208; in order to flirt with fakirs and
    practicioners of the occult? (24)</p>

    <p>He doesn&#8217;t hesitate to speak of an &#8220;ethical function&#8221;
    of socialism, but this must be sought in the creation of a &#8220;morality
    of producers&#8221;. The source of this morality, in turn, he locates in
    classical Marxist fashion in the class struggle at the point of
    production:</p>

    <p class="quote">A morality of producers as Sorel conceives it, as Kautsky
    conceives it, does not arise mechanically from economic interests; it is
    formed in the class struggle, carried out with a heroic spirit and
    passionate will. It is absurd to seek the ethical sentiment of socialism in
    the bourgeoisified trade unions &#8211; or in parliamentary groups,
    spiritually assimilated to the enemy.&#8221; (25)</p>

    <p>Thus Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s basic methods a complex dialectic between
    "material&#8221; and &#8220;ideal&#8221; factors in the historical process.
    That his starting point remains materialist should be clear. If not, this
    will be reinforced when we look at his study of Peruvian society.</p>

    <p>Before turning to that work, however, we must consider one other matter:
    his views on developments in the Soviet Union at the end of the 1920s. It
    appears that in devoting himself heavily to Peruvian questions after his
    return home, Mari&#225;tegui failed to develop his ideas to meet the
    challenge of new events in Europe. He was slow to modify his highly
    optimistic views on the prospects for revolution in Europe, and made no
    substantial analysis of developments in the USSR whatsoever.</p>

    <p>Finally in 1928, Trotsky expulsion from the Soviet Communist Party
    forced him to respond to Russian events. In doing so he displayed a certain
    familiarity with inner-party developments in that country, discussing
    Trotsky&#8217;s problems as an outsider ni the Bolshevik organisation and
    the origins of the Stalin-Trotsky conflict, which he traced back to 1924.
    However he made no attempt to set the conflict against the background of
    social forces: the isolation the revolution, the social weight of the
    peasantry, the growth of bureaucracy. Trotsky, he wrote, had an
    &#8220;international sense of the socialist revolution", which was a fine
    thing, but it &#8220;weakens him at the moment in the practicalities of
    Russian politics."</p>

    <p class="quote">It is not a matter of establishing socialism in the world
    but of creating it in a nation which, though it is a nation of 130 million
    inhabitants spread across two continents, is nevertheless geographically
    and historically a unit. It is logical that in this stage, the Russian
    revolution should be represented by those men who most deeply sense its
    national character and problems. Stalin, pure Slav, is one of these men.
    (26)</p>

    <p>To is credit, Mari&#225;tegui continued to regard Trotsky as a genuine
    socialist, and clearly didn&#8217;t swallow the lies about him being a
    counter-revolutionary. At the same time, his whole analysis was limited to
    a superficial and pragmatic study in <em>realpolitik</em>, which was
    unworthy of his intellect and opened him to exploitation by the later
    Stalinist tradition in his own country, to which his Marxism was not
    inherently congenial.</p>

    <p>Analysing Peruvian society</p>

    <p>In his <em>Seven Essays of Interpretation of Peruvian Reality</em>,
    Mari&#225;tegui made the first attempt ever at a materialist analysis of a
    Latin American society. Beginning with the country&#8217;s economic
    history, the book proceeds to a discussion of the &#8220;Indian problem",
    which Mari&#225;tegui locates firmly within the &#8220;land problem&#8221;.
    Other chapters consider public education, religion, regionalism and
    centralism, and literature, but space precludes a consideration of
    these.</p>

    <p>The arriving Spanish conquistadors found, and destroyed, the great
    empire of the Incas. But they failed to replace it with a progressive new
    form of society, Mari&#225;tegui argues:</p>

    <p class="quote">Spain did not send to Peru &#8211; a dense mass of
    colonisers. The weakness of Spanish imperialism rested precisely on its
    character and structure as more of a military and ecclesiastical enterprise
    than a political and economic one. (27)</p>

    <p>Rather than make use of the Indians, the Spaniards seemed to seek their
    extermination. The use of black slaves to work on <em>haciendas</em> (large
    landholdings) created a strange mixture of feudal and slave economy in the
    coastal areas; while the conquerers regarded the mountains, which they
    disliked, simply as areas to be plundered for gold.</p>

    <p>The colonial regime throttled Peru's commercial expansion by denying it
    the right to trade with any country except Spain, resulting eventually in
    an independence struggle as &#8220;the natural impulse of the productive
    forces of the colonies struggled to break this tie&#8221;. (28) But the
    indepencence struggle represented the interests of the <em>criollo</em>
    (ethnic Spanish) elite, rather than those of the Indian masses, and
    consequently it merely left the country tied to a new imperialist trading
    partner: Britain.</p>

    <p>However Peru was located on the wrong coast to benefit greatly from
    trade with Britain, and remained a backwater except for a temporary boom in
    sales of guano (excrement of seafowl, used as manure). Guano sales allowed
    the formation of a stronger bourgeoisie along the coast, but when Peru lost
    control of the guano deposits to Chile in the War of the Pacific, this
    &#8220;revealed to us in tragic fashion the danger of an economic
    prosperity based almost exclusively on the possession of a natural
    resource.&#8221; (29)</p>

    <p>Peru faced an &#8220;almost absolute collapse of the productive forces"
    (30) and the shattered bourgeoisie temporarily lost power to the military.
    However when the economy revived it did so partly on the basis of modern
    industry. The Panama Canal had shortened trade lines, and the new industry
    found itself supplying another new imperialist power: the United
    States.</p>

    <p>Still, the economy remained overwhelmingly agricultural. In addition to
    the small-scale cultivation of the Indians, there was the semi-feudal
    agriculture of the coastal <em>haciendas</em>. The imperialist connection
    continued to hinder the development of bourgeoisie society:</p>

    <p class="quote">In feudal Europe &#8211; the countryside needed the
    services of the town &#8211; whereas the coastal <em>hacienda</em> produces
    cotton or cane for distant markets. Once assured transport for these
    products, its communication with the local community only interests it
    secondarily.&#8221; (31)</p>

    <p>The consequence was a weak urban bourgeoisie, unable to dominate the
    landowners.</p>

    <p>Having sketched this background, Mari&#225;tegui turns to the
    country&#8217;s Indian population. The second chapter is devoted to a
    critique of various mistaken approaches.</p>

    <p>He condemns as inadequate any attempt to protect the oppressed by merely
    passing laws and decrees, which are simply ignored by the dominant groups.
    Similarly he makes short shrift of those who argue, much like White
    Australia once did, that only racial assimilation can remove the
    difficulty. As for humanitarian teachings, they have &#8220;never held back
    or embarrassed imperialism&#8221; (32) while religious leaders have already
    proved bankrupt. Education might seem a more promising approach, but it
    cannot hope to challenge entrenched vested interests:</p>

    <p class="quote">Socio-economic factors condition the teacher&#8217;s work
    inexorably. <em>Gamonalismo</em> [economic domination by large landowners -
    TOL] is fundamentally incompatible with the education of the Indians. Its
    survival depends as much on maintaining their ignorance as on cultivating
    their alcoholism. (33)</p>

    <p>Thus only an economic approach can deal with the problem, and for the
    Indian the central economic issue is the land:</p>

    <p class="quote">We are not content to demand the Indian&#8217;s right to
    education, culture, progress, love and heaven. We begin by demanding his
    right to the land. (34)</p>

    <p>Feudal relations in the countryside persist despite the Latin American
    "revolution&#8221; (i.e. war of independence) because the revolution was
    not a confrontation between the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy, as it was
    in France, nor did it take on the dimensions of a mass struggle:</p>

    <p class="quote">If the revolution had been a movement of the indigenous
    masses &#8211; it would necessarily have had an "agrarianist&#8221;
    physiognomy &#8211; the French revolution particularly benefited the rural
    class, which it had to rely on for support to avoid the return of the old
    regime. This phenomenon also seems to apply both to the bourgeois and the
    socialist revolution, to judge by &#8211; Russia. (35)</p>

    <p>Given this blocking of Peru&#8217;s social development, Mari&#225;tegui
    concludes that the bourgeoisie has missed its chance to take the country
    forward. &#8220;I think the time for trying liberal methods has
    passed.&#8221; (36) He looks to the working class, but also argues for a
    revolutionary strategy that sees the Indian population as a force for
    socialism. Not only will the Indians fight for land, as the French and
    Russian peasants did, but the Indians still retain elements of communist
    consciousness from earlier times.</p>

    <p>At the base of Inca civilisation was an &#8220;agrarian communism&#8221;
    that yielded economic results superior to those of colonial Peru:</p>

    <p class="quote">Against all the reproaches which &#8211; can be made
    against the Inca regime &#8211; it assured the survival and growth of a
    population which, when the conquistadors arrived in Peru, was up to ten
    millions and which, in three centuries of Spanish rule, fell to one
    million. (37)</p>

    <p>After the independence struggle, the urban and rural ruling classes
    attacked collective property, but this did not mean creating a freeholding
    peasantry. Rather, because of the domination of the rural elite, it simply
    turned out to be a means of imposing semi-feudal relations on a wider
    area.</p>

    <p>Those Indians who retained their land farmed communally, while those
    deprived of it formed communities of whatever type they could, such as
    labour gangs contracting collectively. Different forms of communalism
    emerged:</p>

    <p class="quote">These differences have developed not through evolution
    &#8211; but under the influence of laws directed at the individualisation of
    property &#8211; They demonstrate the vitality of indigenous communism which
    invariably impels the aborigines to various forms of cooperation and
    association. The Indian, despite the laws of a hundred years of the
    republic, has not become an individualist &#8211; Individualism cannot
    prosper, or even effectively exist, except under a regime of free
    competition. And the Indian has never felt less free than when he has felt
    alone. (38)</p>

    <p>Such arguments remind us of the hopes held by some 19th Century
    revolutionaries and partly shared by Marx, that Russian peasant communes
    could become (in Marx&#8217;s words) &#8220;the direct starting point of
    the economic system toward which modern society is tending&#8221; &#208;
    that is, socialism. (39)</p>

    <p>The rapid development of capitalism rendered these hopes obsolete, with
    the Russian peasants moving decisively towards demands for private
    ownership of the land. However, the long-term underdevelopment of
    Peru&#8217;s countryside has meant that the consciousness of the rural
    population has retained elements of rural communism, which could be
    important for revolutionary strategy.</p>

    <p>Certainly, a triumph by the working class in the cities and the creation
    of a collective democracy in industry is the central pre-condition for an
    advance towards socialism. Yet the elements of collectivism among Peruvian
    Indians could be an important factor in cementing an alliance between the
    working people of town and country. This became clear in the late 1960s
    when stormy struggles arose among the mountain dwellers of Peru. At that
    time one of their leaders, Hugo Blanco, wrote:</p>

    <p class="quote">The communal, collective system of the <em>ayllu</em>
    [peasant commune] has, to be sure, deteriorated fundamentally in the face
    of advancing capitalism. Nevertheless, the <em>ayllus</em> maintain many
    communal features. Although the private ownership of plots is now generally
    established, the <em>ayllu</em> still makes efforts to prevent the sale of
    land to outsiders and to redistribute uncultivated land &#8211; The
    contribution of work is reciprocal: work is reimbursed with work
    (<em>hayni</em>). work for the common benefit is carried out collectively.
    The communal organisation is perserved, although every day it deteriorates
    more because of official regulation.</p>

    <p class="quote">The <em>ayllu</em> is acquiring strength with the
    revolutionary upsurge; it rediscovers itself. It is possible that the
    <em>ayllu</em> will become one of the basic forms of the future
    workers&#8217; and peasants&#8217; government. (40)</p>

    <p>If so, that government will look back on Jose Carlos Mari&#225;tegui as
    one of its greatest forebears</p>
