    <h3>Resolution On War And Peace<a id="bk21" href="#fw21" name="bk21"><sup class="enote">[21]</sup></a></h3>

    <p> 
      The Congress recognises the necessity to confirm the extremely
      harsh, humiliating peace treaty with Germany that has been
      concluded by Soviet power in view of our lack of an army, in
      view of the most unhealthy state of the demoralised army at the
      front, in view of the need to take advantage of any, even the
      slightest, possibility of obtaining a respite before imperialism
      launches its offensive against the Soviet Socialist Republic. 

    </p><p> 
      In the present period of the era that has begun, the era of the
      socialist revolution, numerous military attacks on Soviet Russia
      by the imperialist powers (both from the West and from the East)
      are historically inevitable. The historical inevitability of
      such attacks at a time when both internal, class relations and
      international relations are extremely tense, can at any moment,
      even immediately, within the next few days, lead to fresh
      imperialist aggressive wars against the socialist movement in
      general and against the Russian Socialist Soviet Republic in
      particular. 

    </p><p> 
      The Congress therefore declares that it recognises the primary
      and fundamental task of our Party, of the entire vanguard of the
      class-conscious proletariat and of Soviet power, to be the
      adoption of the most energetic, ruthlessly determined and
      Draconian measures to improve the self-discipline and discipline
      of the workers and peasants of Russia, to explain the
      inevitability of Russia&#8217;s historic advance towards a
      socialist, patriotic war of liberation, to create everywhere
      soundly co-ordinated mass organisations held together by a
      single iron will, organisations that are capable of concerted,
      valorous action in their day-to-day efforts and especially  at
      critical moments in the life of the people, and, lastly, to
      train systematically and comprehensively in military matters and
      military operations the entire adult population of both sexes. 

    </p><p> 
      The Congress considers the only reliable guarantee of
      consolidation of the socialist revolution that has been
      victorious in Russia to be its conversion into a world
      working-class revolution. 

    </p><p> 
      The Congress is confident that the step taken by Soviet power in
      view of the present alignment of forces in the world arena was,
      from the standpoint of the interests of the world revolution,
      inevitable and necessary. 

    </p><p> 
      Confident that the working-class revolution is maturing
      persistently in all belligerent countries and is preparing the
      full and inevitable defeat of imperialism, the Congress declares
      that the socialist proletariat of Russia will support the
      fraternal revolutionary movement of the proletariat of all
      countries with all its strength and with every means at its
      disposal.

      The resolution on war and peace was passed on March 8 at the
      morning session of the Party Congress. On Lenin&#8217;s proposal,
      which was affirmed by the Congress, the resolution was not made
      public. It was first published on January 1, 1919 in the
      workers&#8217; daily <em>Kommunar</em>, which was issued by the
      Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) in Moscow from October 9, 1918
      to June 1, 1919.
