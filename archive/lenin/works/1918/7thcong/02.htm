    <p class="fst"> 
      Comrades, let me begin with some relatively minor remarks, let
      me begin from the end. At the end of his speech Comrade Bukharin
      went so far as to compare us to Petlyura. If he thinks that is
      so, how can he remain with us in the same party? Isn&#8217;t it
      just empty talk? If things were really as he said, we should
      not, of course, be members of the same party. The fact that we
      are together shows that we are ninety per cent in agreement with
      Bukharin. It is true he added a few revolutionary phrases about
      our wanting to betray the Ukraine. I am sure it is not worth
      while talking about such obvious nonsense. I shall return to
      Comrade Ryazanov, and here I want to say that in the same way as
      an exception that occurs once in ten years proves the rule, so
      has Comrade Ryazanov chanced to say a serious
      word. (<em>Applause.</em>) He said that Lenin was surrendering
      space to gain time. That is almost philosophical reasoning. This
      time it happened that we heard from Comrade Ryazanov a serious
      phrase&#8212;true it is only a phrase&#8212;which fully
      expresses the case; to gain time I want to surrender space to
      the actual victor. That and that alone is the whole point at
      issue. All else is mere talk&#8212;the need for a revolutionary
      war, rousing the peasantry, etc. When Comrade Bukharin pictures
      things as though there could not be two opinions as to whether
      war is possible and says&#8212;&#8220;ask any soldier&#8221; (I
      wrote down his actual words)&#8212;since he puts the question
      this way and wants to ask any soldier, I&#8217;ll answer
      him. &#8220;Any soldier&#8221; turned out to be a French officer
      that I had a talk with. That French  officer looked at me, with
      anger in his eyes, of course&#8212;had I not sold Russia to the
      Germans?&#8212;and said: &#8220;I am a royalist, I am also a
      champion of the monarchy in France, a champion of the defeat of
      Germany, so don&#8217;t  think I support Soviet power&#8212;who
      would, if he was a royalist?&#8212;but I favour your signing the
      Brest Treaty because it&#8217;s necessary.&#8221;<a id="bk15"
      href="#fw15" name="bk15"><sup class="enote">[15]</sup></a>
      That&#8217;s &#8220;asking any soldier&#8221; for you. Any
      soldier would say what I have said&#8212;we had to sign the
      Brest Treaty. If it now emerges from Bukharin&#8217;s speech
      that our differences have greatly diminished, it is only because
      his supporters have concealed the chief point on which we
      differ. 

    </p><p> 
      Now that Bukharin is thundering against us for having
      demoralised the masses, he is perfectly correct, except that it
      is himself and not us that he is attacking. Who caused this mess
      in the Central Committee?&#8212;You, Comrade
      Bukharin. (<em>Laughter.</em>) No matter how much you shout
      &#8220;No&#8221;, the truth will out; we are here in our own
      comradely family, we are at our own Congress, we have nothing to
      hide, the truth must be told. And the truth is that there were
      three trends in the Central Committee. On February 17 Lomov and
      Bukharin did not vote. I have asked for the record of the voting
      to be reproduced and copies made so that every Party member who
      wishes to do so can go into the secretariat and see how people
      voted&#8212;the historic voting of January 21, which shows that
      they wavered and we did not, not in the least; we said,
      &#8220;Let us accept the Brest peace&#8212;you&#8217;ll get
      nothing better&#8212;so as to prepare  for a revolutionary
      war&#8221;. Now we have gained five days in which to evacuate
      Petrograd. Now the manifesto signed by Krylenko and Podvoisky<a
      id="bk16" href="#fw16" name="bk16"><sup
      class="enote">[16]</sup></a> has been published, they were not
      among the Lefts, and Bukharin insulted them by saying that
      Krylenko had been &#8220;dragged in&#8221;, as though we had
      invented what Krylenko reported. We agree in full with what they
      said; that is how matters stand, for it was these army men who
      gave proof of what I had said; and you dismiss the matter by
      saying the Germans won&#8217;t attack. How can this situation be
      compared with October, when the question of equipment did not
      arise? If you want to take facts into consideration, then
      consider this one&#8212;that the disagreement arose over the
      statement that we cannot start a war that is obviously to our
      disadvantage. When Comrade Bukharin began his concluding speech
      with the thunderous  question &#8220;Is war possible in the near
      future?&#8221; he greatly surprised me. I answer without
      hesitation&#8212;yes, it is possible, but today we must accept
      peace. There is no contradiction in this. 

    </p><p> 
      After these brief remarks I shall give detailed answers to
      previous speakers. As far as Radek  is concerned I must make an
      exception. But there was another speech, that of Comrade
      Uritsky. What was there in that speech apart from Canossa,<a
      id="bk17" href="#fw17" name="bk17"><sup
      class="enote">[17]</sup></a> &#8220;treachery&#8221;,
      &#8220;retreated&#8221;, &#8220;adapted&#8221;? What is all this
      about? Haven&#8217;t you borrowed your criticism from a Left
      Socialist-Revolutionary newspaper? Comrade Bubnov read us a
      statement submitted to the Central Committee by those of its
      members who consider themselves very Left-wing and who gave us a
      striking example of a demonstration before the eyes of the whole
      world&#8212;&#8220;the behaviour of the Central Committee
      strikes a blow at the international proletariat&#8221;. Is that
      anything but an empty phrase? &#8220;Demonstrate weakness before
      the eyes of the whole world!&#8221; How are we demonstrating? By
      proposing peace? Because our army has run away? Have we not
      proved that to begin war with Germany at this moment, and not to
      accept the Brest peace, would mean showing the world that our
      army is sick and does not want to give battle? Bubnov&#8217;s
      statement was quite empty when he asserted that the wavering was
      entirely of our making&#8212;it was due to our army&#8217;s
      being sick. Sooner or later, there had to be a respite. If we
      had had the correct strategy we should have had a month&#8217;s
      breathing space, but since your strategy was incorrect we have
      only five days&#8212;even that is good. The history of war shows
      that even days are sometimes enough to halt a panic-stricken
      army. Anyone who does not accept, does not conclude this
      devilish peace now, is a man of empty phrases and not a
      strategist. That is the pity of it. When Central Committee
      members write to me about &#8220;demonstrations of
      weakness&#8221;, &#8220;treachery&#8221;, they are writing the
      most damaging, empty, childish phrases. We demonstrated our
      weakness by attempting to fight at a time when the demonstration
      should not have been made, when an offensive against us was
      inevitable. As for the peasants of Pskov, we shall bring them to
      the Congress of Soviets to relate how the Germans treat people,
      so that they can change the mood of the soldier in panic-
      stricken night and he will begin to recover from his panic and
      say, &#8220;This is certainly not the war the Bolsheviks
      promised to put an end to, this is a new war the Germans are
      waging against Soviet power.&#8221; Then recovery will come. But
      you raise a question that cannot be answered. Nobody knows how
      long the respite will last. 

    </p><p> 
      Now I must say something about Comrade Trotsky&#8217;s
      position. There are two aspects to his activities; when he began
      the negotiations at Brest and made splendid use of them for
      agitation, we all agreed with Comrade Trotsky. He has quoted
      part of a conversation with me, but I must add that it was
      agreed between us that we would hold out until  the Germans
      presented an ultimatum, and then we would give way. The Germans
      deceived us&#8212;they stole five days out of seven from us.<a
      id="bk18" href="#fw18" name="bk18"><sup
      class="enote">[18]</sup></a> Trotsky&#8217;s tactics were
      correct as long as they were aimed at delaying matters; they
      became incorrect when it was announced that the state of war had
      been terminated but peace had not been concluded. I proposed
      quite definitely that peace be concluded. We could not have got
      anything better than the Brest peace. It is now clear to
      everybody that we would have had a month&#8217;s respite and
      that we would not have lost anything. Since history has swept
      that away it is not worth recalling, but it is funny to hear
      Bukharin say, &#8220;Events will show that we were right.&#8221;
      I was right because I wrote about it back in
      1915&#8212;&#8220;We must prepare to wage war, it is inevitable,
      it is coming, it will come.&#8221; But we had to accept peace
      and not try vain blustering. And because war is coming, it was
      all the more necessary to accept peace, and now we are at least
      making easier the evacuation of Petrograd&#8212;we have made it,
      easier. That is a fact. And when Comrade Trotsky  makes fresh
      demands; &#8220;Promise not to conclude peace with
      Vinnichenko&#8221;, I say that under no circumstances will I
      take that obligation upon myself.<a id="bk19" href="#fw19"
      name="bk19"><sup class="enote">[19]</sup></a> If the Congress
      accepts this obligation, neither I, nor those who agree with me,
      will accept responsibility for it. It would mean tying our hands
      again with a formal decision instead of following a clear line
      of manoeuvre&#8212;retreat when possible, and at times
      attack. In war you must never tie yourself down with formal
      decisions. It is ridiculous not to know the history of war, not
      to know that a treaty is a means of gathering strength&#8212;I
      have already mentioned Prussian history. There are some people
      who are just like children, they think that if we have signed a
      treaty we have sold ourselves to Satan and have gone to
      hell. That is simply ridiculous when it is quite obvious from
      the history of war that the conclusion of a treaty after defeat
      is a means of gathering strength. There have been cases in
      history of one war following immediately after another, we have
      all forgotten that, we see that the old war is turning
      into. . . <span class="inote">[Several words are missing in the
      verbatim report. <em>&#8212;Ed.</em>]</span>  If you like, you
      can bind yourselves for ever with formal decisions and then hand
      over all the  responsible posts to the Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries.  We shall not accept responsibility
      for it. There is not the least desire for a split here. I am
      sure that events will teach you&#8212;March 12 is not far away,
      and you will obtain plenty of material.<a id="bk20" href="#fw20"
      name="bk20"><sup class="enote">[20]</sup></a>

    </p><p> 
      Comrade Trotsky says that it will be treachery in the full sense
      of the word. I maintain that that is an absolutely wrong point
      of view. To demonstrate this concretely, I will give you an
      example: two men are walking together and are attacked by ten
      men, one fights and the other runs away&#8212;that is treachery;
      but suppose we have two armies of a hundred thousand each and
      there are five armies against them; one army is surrounded by
      two hundred thousand, and the other must go to its aid; knowing
      that the other three hundred thousand of the enemy are ambushed
      to trap it, should the second army go to the aid of the first?
      It should not. That is not treachery, that is not cowardice; a
      simple increase in numbers has changed all concepts, any soldier
      knows this; it is no longer a personal concept. By acting in
      this way I preserve my army; let the other army be captured, I
      shall be able to renew mine, I have allies, I shall wait till
      the allies arrive. That is the only way to argue; when military
      arguments are mixed up with others, you get nothing but empty
      phrases. That is not the way to conduct politics. 

    </p><p> 
      We have done everything that could be done. By signing the
      treaty we have saved Petrograd, even if only for a few
      days. (The secretaries and stenographers should not think of
      putting that on record.) The treaty requires us to withdraw our
      troops from Finland, troops that are clearly no good, but we are
      not forbidden to take arms into Finland. If Petrograd had fallen
      a few days ago, the city would have been in a panic and we
      should not have been able to take anything away; but in those
      five days we have helped our Finnish comrades&#8212;how much I
      shall not say, they know it themselves. 

    </p><p> 
      The statement that we have betrayed Finland is just a childish
      phrase. We helped the Finns precisely by retreating before the
      Germans in good time. Russia will never perish just because
      Petrograd falls. Comrade Bukharin is a thousand times right in
      that, but if we manoeuvre in Bukharin&#8217;s way we may ruin a
      good revolution. (<em>Laughter.</em>) 

    </p><p> 
      We have not betrayed either Finland or the Ukraine. No
      class-conscious worker would accuse us of this. We are helping
      as best we can. We have not taken one good man away from our
      army and shall not do so. You say that Hoffmann will catch
      us&#8212;of course he may, I do not doubt it, but how many days
      it will take him, he does not know and nobody
      knows. Furthermore, your arguments about his catching us are
      arguments about the political alignment of forces, of which I
      shall speak later. 

    </p><p> 
      Now that I have explained why I am absolutely unable to accept
      Trotsky&#8217;s proposal&#8212;you cannot conduct politics in
      that way&#8212;I must say that Radek has given us an example of
      how far the comrades at our Congress have departed from empty
      phrases such as Uritsky still sticks to. I certainly cannot
      accuse him of empty phrases in that speech. He said,
      &#8220;There is not a shadow of treachery, not a shadow of
      disgrace, because it is clear that you retreated in the face of
      overpowering military force.&#8221; That is an appraisal that
      destroys Trotsky&#8217;s position. When Radek said, &#8220;We
      must grit our teeth and prepare our forces,&#8221; he was
      right&#8212;I agree with that in full&#8212;don&#8217;t bluster,
      grit your teeth and make preparations. 

    </p><p> 
      Grit your teeth, don&#8217;t bluster and muster your forces. The
      revolutionary war will come, there is no disagreement on this;
      the difference of opinion is on the Peace of Tilsit&#8212;should
      we conclude it or not ? The worst of it is that we have a  sick
      army, and the Central Committee, therefore, must have a firm
      line and not differences of opinion or the middle line that
      Comrade Bukharin also supported. I am not painting the respite
      in bright colours; nobody knows how long it will last and I
      don&#8217;t know. The efforts that are being made to force me to
      say how long it will last are ridiculous. As long as we hold the
      main lines we are helping the Ukraine and Finland. We are taking
      advantage of the respite, manoeuvring and retreating. 

    </p><p> 
      The German worker cannot now be told that the Russians are being
      awkward, for it is now clear that German and Japanese
      imperialism is attacking&#8212;it will be clear to everybody;
      apart from a desire to strangle the Bolsheviks, the Germans also
      want to do some strangling in the West, everything is all mixed
      up, and in this war we shall have to and must be able to
      manoeuvre. 

    </p><p> 
      With regard to Comrade Bukharin&#8217;s speech, I must say that
      when he runs short of arguments he puts forward something in the
      Uritsky manner and says, &#8220;The treaty disgraces us.&#8221;
      Here no arguments are needed; if we have been disgraced we
      should collect our papers and run, but, although we have been
      &#8220;disgraced&#8221;, I do not think our position has been
      shaken. Comrade Bukharin attempted to analyse the class basis of
      our position, but instead of doing so told us an anecdote about
      a deceased Moscow economist. When you discovered some connection
      between our tactics and food speculation&#8212;this was really
      ridiculous&#8212;you forgot that the attitude of the class as a
      whole, the class, and not the food speculators, shows that the
      Russian bourgeoisie and their hangers-on&#8212;the <em>Dyelo
      Naroda</em> and <em>Novaya Zhizn</em> writers&#8212;are bending
      all their efforts to goad us on to war. You do not stress that
      class fact. To declare war on Germany at the moment would be to
      fall for the provocation of the Russian bourgeoisie. That is not
      new because it is the surest&#8212;I do not say absolutely
      certain, because nothing is absolutely certain&#8212;the surest
      way of getting rid of us today. When Comrade Bukharin said that
      events were on their side, that in the long run we would
      recognise revolutionary war, he was celebrating an easy victory
      since we prophesied the inevitability of a revolutionary war in
      1915. Our differences were on the following&#8212;would the
      Germans attack or not;  that we should have declared the state
      of war terminated; that in the interests of revolutionary war we
      should have to retreat, surrendering territory to gain
      time. Strategy and politics prescribe the most disgusting peace
      treaty imaginable. Our differences will all disappear once we
      recognise these tactics.

      The reference is to the appeal of the People&#8217;s
      Commissariat for Military Affairs, which called upon all workers
      and peasants to take up voluntary military training. Military
      training had to be made voluntary because the Russian Army under
      the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was to be completely
      demobilised. The appeal was published on March 5, 1918 in the
      newspaper <em>Izvestia VTsIK</em> No. 40.

    <em>Canossa</em>&#8212;castle in Northern Italy. In 1077, the
    Roman Emperor Henry IV, who had been defeated by Pope Gregory VII,
    stood for three days in the robes of repentance before the gates
    of this castle in order to save himself from excommunication and
    regain his power as emperor. Hence the phrase &#8220;to go to
    Canossa&#8221;, i.e., to humiliate oneself before a person whom
    one has previously resisted.

    According to the terms of the armistice concluded on December 2
    (15), 1917 at Brest-Litovsk between the Soviet Government and the
    powers of the Quadruple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary,
    Bulgaria and Turkey), either side could renew hostilities at seven
    days&#8217; notice. The German military command broke this
    condition by launching an offensive along the whole front on
    February 18, two days after denouncing the armistice.

    According to Clause VI of the Treaty of Brest, signed on March 3,
    1918 Russia undertook to conclude peace with the
    counter-revolutionary Ukrainian Central Rada. The peace
    negotiations between the Soviet Government and the Rada did not
    take place, however. On April 29, 1918 the German occupation
    forces in collusion with the Constitutional-Democrat and Octobrist
    bourgeoisie engineered a coup in the Ukraine. The Rada was
    overthrown and replaced by the dictatorial regime of Hetman
    Skoropadsky. Negotiations between Soviet Russia and the
    Skoropadsky government began on May 23 and an armistice was signed
    on June 14, 1918.

    March 12 was the provisional date for the assembly of the
