    <h2>V. I. Lenin</h2>
    <h3>Extraordinary Seventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) </h3>

    <h2> MARCH 6-8, 1918 </h2>
    <h3>Section Fourteen</h3>

    <h2>14</h2>

    <h3>Speech Against Pelshe&#8217;s Amendment To The Resolution On The Party Programme<br />   March 8 (Evening)</h3>

    <p class="fst"> 
      I think that the last speaker is wrong.<a id="bk37" href="#fw37"
      name="bk37"><sup class="enote">[37]</sup></a> The masses are not
      children and they understand that the struggle is extremely
      serious. They saw how we were thrown back previously, for
      example in July. It is impossible to delete these words. We
      ought not in any way to give the impression that we attach
      absolutely no value to bourgeois parliamentary
      institutions. They are a huge advance on what preceded them. By
      rejecting these words we create an impression of something that
      does not yet exist&#8212;of the absolute stability of the stage
      achieved. We know that this is not so yet. It will be so when
      the international movement gives its support I am ready to
      delete the words &#8220;under no circumstances&#8221; it is
      possible to leave the words &#8220;the Party will not reject the
      use&#8221;, but we cannot leave the way open for a purely
      anarchist denial of bourgeois parliamentarism. These are stages
      directly linked one with another, and any repulse can throw us
      back to that stage. I do not consider that this would cause the
      masses to be despondent. If by the masses we mean people who are
      politically quite uneducated&#8212;they will not understand, but
      the Party members and sympathisers will understand, they will
      realise that we do not regard the positions won as definitely
      consolidated. If by a gigantic effort of will we arouse the
      energy of all classes, and consolidate this position, then we
      shall cease to recall the past But that requires the support of
      Europe. But to say now that we may work under worse
      circumstances will not result in any despondency among the
      masses.

      The &#8220;last speaker&#8221; was R. A. Pelshe, who proposed
      removing from the Party Programme the proposition on using the
      parliamentary struggle. His amendment was rejected by the
      Congress.
