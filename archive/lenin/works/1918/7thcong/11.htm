    <h3>Proposal Concerning The Revision Of The Party Programme<br />
     March 8 (Evening)</h3>

    <p>Comrades, allow me to read the draft of a resolution which formulates a somewhat different
    proposal, but which in substance is somewhat similar to what the last speaker has said.<a
    id="bk34" href="#fw34" name="bk34"><sup class="enote">[34]</sup></a> I request the
    Congress&#8217;s attention to the following resolution. (<em>He reads it.</em>)</p>

    <p>Comrades, the distinguishing feature of this proposal is that I want first of all to
    defend my idea of accelerating the publication of the Programme and directly instruct the
    Central Committee to publish it or set up a special commission.</p>

    <p>The tempo of development is so furious that we ought not to delay. In view of the
    difficulties of the present time, we shall have a programme in which there will be many
    mistakes, but that does not matter&#8212;the next Congress will correct it, even if it is a
    too rapid correction of the Programme; but events move so swiftly that if it is necessary to
    make a series of alterations to the Programme, we shall make them. Our Programme now will be
    constructed not so much according to the books as from practice, from the experience of
    Soviet power. Accordingly, I believe that it is in our interests to approach the
    international proletariat not with ardent appeals, not with exhortatory speeches at meetings,
    not with shouts, but with the precise, concrete Programme of our Party. Let the Programme be
    less satisfactory than one which would result from being worked on in a number of commissions
    and endorsed by the Congress.</p>

    <p>I venture to hope that we shall pass this resolution unanimously because I have avoided
      the disagreement to which Comrade Bukharin has referred; I have formulated it in such a way
      as to leave the question open. We can hope that if too great changes do not occur we shall be
      in a position to have a new programme which will be a precise document for the All-Russia
      Party, and shall not be in the nasty position in which I found myself when at the last
      Congress one of the Left Swedes asked me: &#8220;But what is the programme of your
      Party&#8212;is it the same as that of the Mensheviks?&#8221;<a id="bk35" href="#fw35"
								   name="bk35"><sup class="enote">[35]</sup></a> You ought to have seen the expression of
      surprise on the face of this Swede, who fully understood how immensely far we had gone away
      from the Mensheviks. We cannot allow such a monstrous contradiction to remain. I think that
      this will be of practical benefit to the international working-class movement, and that what
      we shall gain will undoubtedly outweigh the fact that the
      programme will have mistakes.

    </p><p> 
      That is why I propose that this be accelerated, without
      being in the least afraid of the Congress having to correct
      it.</p>

    <h3>Endnotes</h3>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw34" href="#bk34" name="fw34">[34]</a> The &#8220;last
      speaker&#8221; was the delegate to the Congress for the Petrograd Party organisation Y. G.
      Fenigstein (Doletsky). On the grounds that the draft programme had not been discussed in the
      Party organisations, he proposed setting up at the Congress a commission to consider
      Lenin&#8217;s draft and to work out a programme for the next Congress.</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw35" href="#bk35" name="fw35">[35]</a> This appears to be a
      reference to a conversation with the leader of the Swedish Left Social-Democratic Party
      H&#246;glund, who visited Soviet Russia in February 1918.</p>
