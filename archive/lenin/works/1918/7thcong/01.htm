    <h3>Political Report Of The Central Committee</h3>
    <h4>March 7</h4>

    <p class="fst"> 
      A political report might consist of an enumeration of measures taken
      by the Central Committee; but the essential thing at the present
      moment is not a report of this kind, but a review of our revolution
      as a whole; that is the only thing that can provide a truly Marxist
      substantiation of all our decisions. We must examine the whole
      preceding course of development of the revolution and ascertain why
      the course of its further development has changed. There have been
      turning-points in our revolution that will have enormous
      significance for the world revolution. One such turning-point was
      the October Revolution. 


    </p><p> 
      The first successes of the February Revolution were due to the
      fact that the proletariat was followed, not only by the masses
      of the rural population, but also by the bourgeoisie. Hence, the
      easy victory over tsarism, something we had failed to achieve in
      1905. The spontaneous formation of Soviets of Workers&#8217;
      Deputies in the February Revolution was a repetition of the
      experience of 1905&#8212;we had to proclaim the principle of
      Soviet power. The masses learned the tasks of the revolution
      from their own experience of the struggle. The events of April
      20-21<a id="bk2" href="#fw2" name="bk2"><sup
      class="enote">[2]</sup></a> were a peculiar combination of
      demonstrations and of something in the nature of armed
      uprising. This was enough to cause the fall of the bourgeois
      government. Then began the long period of the collaboration
      policy, which stemmed from the very nature of the
      petty-bourgeois government that had come to power. The July
      events<a id="bk3" href="#fw3" name="bk3"><sup
      class="enote">[3]</sup></a> could not then establish the
      dictatorship of the proletariat&#8212;the masses were still not
      prepared for  it. That was why not one of the responsible
      organisations called upon them to establish it. But as a
      reconnoitring operation in the enemy&#8217;s camp, the July
      events were of enormous significance. The Kornilov revolt<a
      id="bk4" href="#fw4" name="bk4"><sup class="enote">[4]</sup></a>
      and the subsequent events served as practical lessons and made
      possible the October victory. The mistake committed by those who
      even in October wished to divide power<a id="bk5" href="#fw5"
      name="bk5"><sup class="enote">[5]</sup></a> was their failure to
      connect the October victory with the July days, with the
      offensive, with the Kornilov revolt, etc., etc., events which
      caused the millions of the common people to realise that Soviet
      power had become inevitable. Then followed our triumphal march
      throughout Russia, accompanied by a universal desire for
      peace. We know that we cannot achieve peace by a unilateral
      withdrawal from the war. We pointed to this as far back as the
      <a
      href="../../../../../glossary/events/a/arcon-b.htm#april-1917">April
      Conference</a>. In the period from April to October, the
      soldiers clearly realised that the policy of collaboration was
      prolonging the war and was leading to the savage, senseless
      attempts of the imperialists to start an offensive and to get
      still more entangled in a war that would last for years. That
      was the reason why it was necessary at all costs to adopt an
      active policy of peace as quickly as possible, why it was
      necessary for the Soviets to take power into their own hands,
      and abolish landed proprietorship. You know that the latter was
      upheld not only by Kerensky but also by Avksentyev, who even
      went so far as to order the arrest of the members of the Land
      Committees. The policy we adopted, the slogan of &#8220;Power to
      the Soviets&#8221;, which we instilled into the minds of the
      majority of the people, enabled us, in October, to achieve
      victory very easily in St. Petersburg, and transformed the last
      months of the Russian revolution into one continuous triumphal
      march. 

    </p><p> 
      Civil war became a fact. The transformation of the imperialist
      war into civil war, which we had predicted at the beginning of
      the revolution, and even at the beginning of the war, and which
      considerable sections of socialist circles treated skeptically
      and even with ridicule, actually took place on October 25, 1917,
      in one of the largest and most backward of the belligerent
      countries. In this civil war the overwhelming majority of the
      population proved to be on our side, and that is why victory was
      achieved with such extraordinary ease. </p>

    <p>  
      The troops who abandoned the front carried with them wherever
      they went the maximum of revolutionary determination to put an
      end to collaboration; and the collaborationist elements, the
      whiteguards and the landowners&#8217; sons found themselves
      without support among the population. The war against them
      gradually turned into a victorious triumphal march of the
      revolution as the masses of the people and the military units
      that were sent against us came over to the side of the
      Bolsheviks. We saw this in Petrograd, on the Gatchina front,
      where the Cossacks, whom Kerensky and Krasnov tried to lead
      against the Red capital, wavered; we saw this later in Moscow,
      in Orenburg and in the Ukraine. A wave of civil war swept over
      the whole of Russia, and everywhere we achieved victory with
      extraordinary ease precisely because the fruit had ripened,
      because the masses had already gone through the experience of
      collaboration with the bourgeoisie. Our slogan &#8220;All Power
      to the Soviets&#8221;, which the masses had tested in practice
      by long historical experience, had become part of their flesh
      and blood. 

    </p><p> 
      That is why the Russian revolution was a continuous triumphal
      march in the first months after October 25, 1917. As a result of
      this the difficulties which the socialist revolution immediately
      encountered, and could not but encounter, were forgotten, were
      pushed into the background. One of the fundamental differences
      between bourgeois revolution and socialist revolution is that
      for the bourgeois revolution, which arises out of feudalism, the
      new economic organisations are gradually created in the womb of
      the old order, gradually changing all the aspects of feudal
      society.The bourgeois revolution faced only one task&#8212;to
      sweep away, to cast aside, to destroy all the fetters of the
      preceding social order. By fulfilling this task every bourgeois
      revolution fulfils all that is required of it; it accelerates
      the growth of capitalism. 

    </p><p> 
      The socialist revolution is in an altogether different
      position. The more backward the country which, owing to the
      zigzags of history, has proved to be the one to start the
      socialist revolution, the more difficult is it for that country
      to pass from the old capitalist relations to socialist
      relations. New incredibly difficult tasks, organisational tasks,
      are added to the tasks of destruction. Had not the popular
      creative spirit of the Russian revolution, which had gone
      through the great experience of the year 1905, given rise to the
      Soviets as early as February 1917, they could not under any
      circumstances have assumed power in October, because success
      depended entirely upon the existence of available organisational
      forms of a movement embracing millions. The Soviets were the
      available form, and that is why in the political sphere the
      future held out to us those brilliant successes, the continuous
      triumphal march, that we had; for the new form of political
      power was already available, and all we had to do was to pass a
      few decrees, and transform the power of the Soviets from the
      embryonic state in which it existed in the first months of the
      revolution into the legally recognised form which had become
      established in the Russian state&#8212;i.e., into the Russian
      Soviet Republic. The Republic was born at one stroke; it was
      born so easily because in February 1917 the masses had created
      the Soviets even before any party had managed to proclaim this
      slogan. It was the great creative spirit of the people, which
      had passed through the bitter experience of 1905 and had been
      made wise by it, that gave rise to this form of proletarian
      power. The task of achieving victory over the internal enemy was
      an extremely easy one. The task of creating the political power
      was an extremely easy one because the masses had created the
      skeleton, the basis of this power. The Republic of Soviets was
      born at one stroke. But two exceedingly difficult problems still
      remained, the solution of which could not possibly be the
      triumphal march we experienced in the first months of our
      revolution&#8212;we did not doubt, we could not doubt, that the
      socialist revolution would be later confronted with enormously
      difficult tasks. 

    </p><p> 
      First, there was the problem of internal organisation, which
      confronts every socialist revolution. The difference between a
      socialist revolution and a bourgeois revolution is that in the
      latter case there are ready-made forms of capitalist
      relationships; Soviet power&#8212;the proletarian
      power&#8212;does not inherit such ready-made relationships, if
      we leave out of account the most developed forms of capitalism,
      which, strictly speaking, extended to but a small top layer of
      industry and hardly touched agriculture. The organisation of
      accounting, the control of large enterprises, the transformation
      of the whole of the state economic mechanism into a single huge
      machine, into an economic organism that will work in such a way
      as to enable hundreds of millions of people to be guided by a
      single plan&#8212;such was the enormous organisational problem
      that rested on our shoulders. Under the present conditions of
      labour this problem could not possibly be solved by the
      &#8220;hurrah&#8221; methods by which we were able to solve the
      problems of the Civil War. The very nature of the task prevented
      a solution by these methods. We achieved easy victories over the
      Kaledin<a id="bk6" href="#fw6" name="bk6"><sup
      class="enote">[6]</sup></a> revolt and created the Soviet
      Republic in face of a resistance that was not even worth serious
      consideration; the course of events was predetermined by the
      whole of the preceding objective development, so that all we had
      to do was say the last word and change the signboard, i.e., take
      down the sign &#8220;The Soviet exists as a trade union
      organisation&#8221;, and put up instead the sign &#8220;The
      Soviet is the sole form of state power"; the situation, however,
      was altogether different in regard to organisational
      problems. In this field we encountered enormous difficulties. It
      immediately became clear to everyone who cared to ponder over
      the tasks of our revolution that only by the hard and long path
      of self-discipline would it be possible to overcome the
      disintegration that the war had caused in capitalist society,
      that only by extraordinarily hard, long and persistent effort
      could we cope with this disintegration and defeat those elements
      aggravating it, elements which regarded the revolution as a
      means of discarding old fetters and getting as much out of it
      for themselves as they possibly could. The emergence of a large
      number of such elements was inevitable in a small-peasant
      country at a time of incredible economic chaos, and the fight
      against these elements that is ahead of us, that we have only
      just started, will be a hundred times more difficult, it will be
      a fight which promises no spectacular opportunities. We are only
      in the first stage of this fight. Severe trials await us. The
      objective situation precludes any idea of limiting ourselves to
      a triumphal march with flying banners such as we had in fighting
      against Kaledin. Anyone who attempted to apply these methods of
      struggle to the organisational tasks that confront the
      revolution would only prove his bankruptcy as a politician, as a
      socialist, as an active worker in the socialist revolution.

      </p><p> 
      The same thing awaited some of our young comrades who were
      carried away by the initial triumphal march of the revolution,
      when it came up against the second enormous difficulty&#8212;the
      international question. The reason we achieved such an easy
      victory over Kerensky&#8217;s gangs, the reason we so easily set
      up our government and without the slightest difficulty passed
      decrees on the socialisation of the land and on workers&#8217;
      control, the reason we achieved all this so easily was a
      fortunate combination of circumstances that protected us for a
      short time from international imperialism. International
      imperialism, with the entire might of its capital, with its
      highly organised war machine, which is a real force, a real
      stronghold of international capital, could not, under any
      circumstances, under any conditions, live side by side with the
      Soviet Republic, both because of its objective position and
      because of the economic interests of the capitalist class
      embodied in it, because of commercial connections, of
      international financial relations. In this sphere a conflict is
      inevitable. This is the greatest difficulty of the Russian
      revolution, its greatest historical problem&#8212;the need to
      solve international problems, the need to evoke a world
      revolution, to effect the transition from our strictly national
      revolution to the world revolution. This problem confronts us in
      all its incredible difficulty. I repeat, very many of our young
      friends who regard themselves as Lefts have begun to forget the
      most important thing: why in the course of the weeks and months
      of the enormous triumph after October we were able so easily to
      pass from victory to victory. And yet this was due only to a
      special combination of international circumstances that
      temporarily shielded us from imperialism. Imperialism had other
      things to bother about besides us. And it seemed to us that we,
      too, had other things to bother about besides
      imperialism. Individual imperialists had no time to bother with
      us, solely because the whole of the great social, political and
      military might of modern world imperialism was split by
      internecine war into two groups. The imperialist plunderers
      involved in this struggle had gone to such incredible lengths,
      were locked in mortal combat to such a degree, that neither of
      the groups was able to concentrate any effective forces against
      the Russian revolution. These were the circumstances in which we
      found ourselves in October. It is paradoxical but true that our
      revolution broke out at so fortunate a moment, when
      unprecedented disasters involving the destruction of millions of
      human beings had overtaken most of the imperialist countries,
      when the unprecedented calamities attending the war had
      exhausted the nations, when in the fourth year of the war the
      belligerent countries had reached an impasse, a parting of the
      ways, when the question arose objectively&#8212;could nations
      reduced to such a state continue fighting? It was only because
      our revolution broke out at so fortunate a moment as this, when
      neither of the two gigantic groups of plunderers was in a
      position immediately either to hurl itself at the other, or to
      unite with the other against us; our revolution could (and did)
      take advantage only of a situation such as this in international
      political and economic relations to accomplish its brilliant
      triumphal march in European Russia, spread to Finland and begin
      to win the Caucasus and Rumania. This alone explains the
      appearance of Party functionaries, intellectual supermen, in the
      leading circles of our Party who allowed themselves to be
      carried away by this triumphal march and who said we could cope
      with international imperialism; over there, there will also be a
      triumphal march, over there, there will be no real
      difficulties. This was at variance with the objective position
      of the Russian revolution which had merely taken advantage of
      the setback of international imperialism; the engine that was
      supposed to bear down on us with the force of a railway train
      bearing down on a wheelbarrow and smashing it to splinters, was
      temporarily stalled&#8212;and the engine was stalled because the
      two groups of predators had clashed. Here and there the
      revolutionary movement was growing, but in all the imperialist
      countries without exception it was still mainly in the initial
      stage. Its rate of development was entirely different from
      ours. Anyone who has given careful thought to the economic
      prerequisites of the socialist revolution in Europe must be
      clear on the point that in Europe it will be immeasurably more
      difficult to start, whereas it was immeasurably more easy for us
      to start; but it will be more difficult for us to continue the
      revolution than it will be over there. This objective situation
      caused us to experience an extraordinarily sharp and difficult
      turn in history. 

      From the continuous triumphal march on our internal front,
      against our counter-revolution, against the enemies of Soviet
      power in October, November and December, we had to pass to a
      collision with real international imperialism, in its real
      hostility towards us. From the period of the triumphal march we
      had to pass to a period in which we were in an extraordinarily
      difficult and painful situation, one which certainly could not
      be brushed aside with words, with brilliant
      slogans&#8212;however pleasant that would have
      been&#8212;because in our disorganised country we had to deal
      with incredibly weary masses, who had reached a state in which
      they could not possibly go on fighting, who were so shattered by
      three years of agonising war that they were absolutely useless
      from the military point of view. Even before the October
      Revolution we saw representatives of the masses of the soldiers,
      not members of the Bolshevik Party, who did not hesitate to tell
      the bourgeoisie the truth that the Russian army would not
      fight. This state of the army has brought about a gigantic
      crisis. A small-peasant country, disorganised by war, reduced to
      an incredible state, has been placed in an extremely difficult
      position. We have no army, but we have to go on living side by
      side with a predator who is armed to the teeth, a predator who
      still remains and will continue to remain a plunderer and is
      not, of course, affected by agitation in favour of peace without
      annexations and indemnities. A tame, domestic animal has been
      lying side by side with a tiger and trying to persuade the
      latter to conclude a peace without annexations and indemnities,
      although the only way such a peace could be attained was by
      attacking the tiger. The top layer of our
      Party&#8212;intellectuals and some of the workers&#8217;
      organisations&#8212;has been trying in the main to brush this
      prospect aside with phrases and such excuses as &#8220;that is
      not the way it should be&#8221;. This peace was too incredible a
      prospect for them to believe that we, who up to now had marched
      in open battle with colours flying and had stormed the
      enemy&#8217;s positions with &#8220;hurrahs&#8221;, could yield
      and accept these humiliating terms. Never! We are exceedingly
      proud revolutionaries, we declare above all: &#8220;The Germans
      cannot attack.&#8221;<a id="bk7" href="#fw7" name="bk7"><sup
      class="enote">[7]</sup></a> 

    </p><p> 
      This was the first argument with which these people consoled
      themselves. History has now placed us in an extraordinarily
      difficult position; in the midst of organisational work of
      unparalleled difficulty we shall have to experience a number of
      painful defeats. Regarded from the world-historical point of
      view, there would doubtlessly be no hope of the ultimate victory
      of our revolution if it were to remain alone, if there were no
      revolutionary movements in other countries. When the Bolshevik
      Party tackled the job alone, it did so in the firm conviction
      that the revolution was maturing in all countries and that in
      the end&#8212;but not at the very beginning&#8212;no matter what
      difficulties we experienced, no matter what defeats were in
      store for us, the world socialist revolution would
      come&#8212;because it is coming; would mature&#8212; because it
      is maturing and will reach full maturity. I repeat, our
      salvation from all these difficulties is an all Europe
      revolution. Taking this truth, this absolutely abstract truth,
      as our starting-point, and being guided by it, we must see to it
      that it does not in time become a mere phrase, because every
      abstract truth, if it is accepted without analysis, becomes a
      mere phrase. If you say that every strike conceals the hydra of
      revolution, and he who fails to understand this is no socialist,
      you are right. Yes, the socialist revolution looms behind every
      strike. But if you say that every single strike is an immediate
      step towards the socialist revolution, you will be uttering
      perfectly empty phrases. We have heard these phrases
      &#8220;every blessed time in the same place&#8221; and have got
      so sick and tired of them that the workers have rejected these
      anarchist phrases, because undoubtedly, clear as it is that
      behind every strike there looms the hydra of socialist
      revolution, it is equally clear that the assertion that every
      strike can develop into revolution is utter nonsense. Just as it
      is indisputable that all the difficulties in our revolution will
      be overcome only when the world socialist revolution
      matures&#8212;and it is maturing now everywhere&#8212;it is
      absolutely absurd to declare that we must conceal every real
      difficulty of our revolution today and say: &#8220;I bank on the
      international socialist movement&#8212;I can commit any piece of
      folly I please.&#8221; &#8220;Liebknecht will help us out,
      because he is going to win, anyhow.&#8221; He will create such
      an excellent organisation, he will plan everything beforehand so
      well that we shall be able to take ready-made forms in the same
      way as we took the ready-made Marxist doctrine from Western
      Europe&#8212;and maybe that is why it triumphed in our country
      in a few months, whereas it has been taking decades to triumph
      in Western Europe. Thus lt would have been reckless gambling to
      apply the old method of solving the problem of the struggle by a
      triumphal march to the new historical period which has set in,
      and which has confronted us, not with feeble Kerensky and
      Kornilov, but with an international predator&#8212;the
      imperialism of Germany, where the revolution has been maturing
      but has obviously not yet reached maturity. The assertion that
      the enemy would not dare attack the revolution was such a
      gamble. The situation at the time of the Brest negotiations<a
      id="bk8" href="#fw8" name="bk8"><sup class="enote">[8]</sup></a>
      was not yet such as to compel us to accept any peace terms. The
      objective alignment of forces was such that a respite would not
      have been enough. It took the Brest negotiations to show that
      the Germans would attack, that German society was not so
      pregnant with revolution that it could give birth to it at once;
      and we cannot blame the German imperialists for not having
      prepared that outbreak by their conduct, or, as our young
      friends who regard themselves as Lefts say, for not having
      created a situation in which the Germans could not attack. When
      we tell them that we have no army, that we were compelled to
      demobilise&#8212;we were compelled to do so, although we never
      forgot that a tiger was lying beside our tame, domestic
      animal&#8212;they refuse to understand. Although we were
      compelled to demobilise we did not for a moment forget that it
      was impossible to end the war unilaterally by issuing an order
      to stick the bayonets in the ground. 

    </p><p> 
      Generally speaking, how is it that not a single trend, not a
      single tendency, not a single organisation in our Party opposed
      this demobilisation? Had we gone mad? Not in the
      least. Officers, not Bolsheviks, had stated even before October
      that the army could not fight, that it could not be kept at the
      front even for a few weeks longer. After October this became
      obvious to everybody who was willing to recognise the facts,
      willing to see the unpleasant, bitter reality and not hide, or
      pull his cap over his eyes, and make shift with proud
      phrases. We have no army, we cannot hold it. The best thing we
      can do is to demobilise it as quickly as possible. This is the
      sick part of the organism, which has suffered incredible
      torture, has been ravaged by the priva tions of a war into which
      it entered technically unprepared, and from which it has emerged
      in such a state that it succumbs to panic at every attack. We
      cannot blame these people who have experienced incredible
      suffering. In hundreds of resolutions, even in the first period
      of the Russian revolution, the soldiers have said quite frankly:
      &#8220;We are drowning in blood, we cannot go on
      fighting.&#8221; One could have delayed the end of the war
      artificially, one could have committed the frauds Kerensky
      committed, one could have postponed the end for a few weeks, but
      objective reality broke its own road. This is the sick part of
      the Russian state organism which can no longer bear the burden
      of the war. The quicker we demobilise the army, the sooner it
      will become absorbed by those parts that are not so sick and the
      sooner will the country be prepared for new severe trials. That
      is what we felt when we unanimously, without the slightest
      protest, adopted the decision&#8212;which was absurd from the
      point of view of foreign events&#8212;to demobilise the army. It
      was the proper step to take. We said that it was a frivolous
      illusion to believe that we could hold the army. The sooner we
      demobilised the army, the sooner would the social organism as a
      whole recover. That is why the revolutionary phrase, &#8220;The
      Germans cannot attack&#8221;, from which the other phrase ("We
      can declare the state of war terminated. Neither war nor the
      signing of peace.") derived, was such a profound mistake, such a
      bitter over-estimation of events. But suppose the Germans do
      attack? &#8220;No, they cannot attack.&#8221; But have you the
      right to risk the world revolution? What about the concrete
      question of whether you may not prove to be accomplices of
      German imperialism when that moment comes? But we, who since
      October 1917 have all become defencists, who have recognised the
      principle of defence of the fatherland, we all know that we have
      broken with imperialism, not merely in word but in deed; we have
      destroyed the secret treaties,<a id="bk9" href="#fw9"
      name="bk9"><sup class="enote">[9]</sup></a>  vanquished the
      bourgeoisie in our own country and proposed an open and honest
      peace so that all the nations may see what our intentions really
      are. How could people who seriously uphold the position of
      defending the Soviet Republic agree to this gamble, which has
      already produced results? And this is a fact, because the severe
      crisis which our Party is now experiencing, owing to the
      formation of a &#8220;Left&#8221; opposition within it, is one
      of the gravest crises the Russian revolution has experienced. 

    </p><p> 
      This crisis will be overcome. Under no circumstances will it
      break the neck of our Party, or of our revolution, although at
      the present moment it has come very near to doing so, there was
      a possibility of it. The guarantee that we shall not break our
      neck on this question is this: instead of applying the old
      method of settling factional differences, the old method of
      issuing an enormous quantity of literature, of having many
      discussions and plenty of splits, instead of this old method,
      events have provided our people with a new method of learning
      things. This method is to put every thing to the test of facts,
      events, the lessons of world history. You said that the Germans
      could not attack. The logic of your tactics was that we could
      declare the state of war to be terminated. History has taught
      you a lesson, it has shattered this illusion. Yes, the German
      revolution is growing, but not in the way we should like it, not
      as fast as Russian intellectuals would have it, not at the rate
      our history developed in October&#8212;when we entered any town
      we liked, proclaimed Soviet power, and within a few days
      nine-tenths of the workers came over to our side. The German
      revolution has the misfortune of not moving so fast. What do you
      think? Must we reckon with the revolution, or must the
      revolution reckon with us? You wanted the revolution to reckon
      with you. But history has taught you a lesson. It is a lesson,
      because it is the absolute truth that without a German
      revolution we are doomed&#8212;perhaps not in Petrograd, not in
      Moscow, but in Vladivostok, in more remote places to which
      perhaps we shall have to retreat, and the distance to which is
      perhaps greater than the distance from Petrograd to Moscow. At
      all events, under all conceivable circumstances, if the German
      revolution does not come, we are doomed. Nevertheless, this does
      not in the least shake our conviction that we must be able to
      bear the most difficult position without blustering. 

    </p><p> 
      The revolution will not come as quickly as we expected. History
      has proved this, and we must be able to take this as a fact, to
      reckon with the fact that the world socialist revolution cannot
      begin so easily in the advanced countries as the revolution
      began in Russia&#8212;in the land of Nicholas and Rasputin, the
      land in which an enormous part of the population was absolutely
      indifferent as to what peoples were living in the outlying
      regions, or what was happening there. In such a country it was
      quite easy to start a revolution, as easy as lifting a feather. 

    </p><p> 
      But to start without preparation a revolution in a country in
      which capitalism is developed and has given democratic culture
      and organisation to everybody, down to the last man&#8212;to do
      so would be wrong, absurd. There we are only just approaching
      the painful period of the beginning of socialist
      revolutions. This is a fact. We do not know, no one knows,
      perhaps&#8212;it is quite possible&#8212;it will triumph within
      a few weeks, even within a few days, but we cannot stake
      everything on that. We must be prepared for extraordinary
      difficulties, for extraordinarily severe defeats, which are
      inevitable because the revolution in Europe has not yet begun,
      although it may begin tomorrow; and when it does begin, then, of
      course, we shall not be tortured by doubts, there will be no
      question about a revolutionary war, but just one continuous
      triumphal march. That is to come, it will inevitably be so, but
      it is not so yet. This is the simple fact that history has
      taught us, with which it has hit us very painfully&#8212;and it
      is said a man who has been thrashed is worth two who
      haven&#8217;t. That is why I think that now history has given us
      a very painful thrashing, because of our hope that the Germans
      could not attack and that we could get everything by shouting
      &#8220;hurrah!&#8221;, this lesson, with the help of our Soviet
      organisations, will be very quickly brought home to the masses
      all over Soviet Russia. They are aIl up and doing, gathering,
      preparing for the Congress, passing resolutions, thinking over
      what has happened. What is taking place at the present time does
      not resemble the old pre-revolutionary controversies, which
      remained within narrow Party circles; now all decisions are
      submitted for discussion to the masses, who demand that they be
      tested by experience, by deeds, who never allow themselves to be
      carried away by frivolous speeches, and never allow themselves
      to be diverted from the path prescribed by the objective
      progress of events. Of course, an intellectual, or a Left
      Bolshevik, can try to talk his way out of difficulties. He can
      try to talk his way out of such facts as the absence of an army
      and the failure of the revolution to begin in Germany. The
      millions-strong masses&#8212;and politics begin where millions
      of men and women are; where there are not thousands, but
      millions, that is where serious politics begin&#8212;the masses
      know what the army is like, they have seen soldiers returning
      from the front. They know&#8212;that is, if you take, not
      individual persons, but real masses&#8212;that we cannot fight,
      that every man at the front has endured everything
      imaginable. The masses have realised the truth that if we have
      no army, and a predator is lying beside us, we shall have to
      sign a most harsh, humiliating peace treaty. That is inevitable
      until the birth of the revolution, until you cure your army,
      until you allow the men to return home. Until then the patient
      will not recover. And we shall not be able to cope with the
      German predator by shouting &#8220;hurrah!"; we shall not be
      able to throw him off as easily as we threw off Kerensky and
      Kornilov. This is the lesson the masses have learned without the
      excuses that certain of those who desire to evade bitter reality
      have tried to present them with. 

    </p><p> 
      At first a continuous triumphal march in October and
      November&#8212;then, suddenly, in the space of a few weeks, the
      Russian revolution is defeated by the German predator; the
      Russian revolution is prepared to accept the terms of a
      predatory treaty. Yes, the turns taken by history are very
      painful. All such turns affect us painfully. When, in 1907, we
      signed the incredibly shameful internal treaty with Stolypin,
      when we were compelled to pass through the pigsty of the
      Stolypin Duma and assumed obligations by signing scraps of
      monarchist paper,<a id="bk10" href="#fw10" name="bk10"><sup
      class="enote">[10]</sup></a> we experienced what we are
      experiencing now but on a smaller scale. At that time, people
      who were among the finest in the vanguard of the revolution said
      (and they too had not the slightest doubt that they were right),
      &#8220;We are proud revolutionaries, we believe in the Russian
      revolution, we will never enter legal Stolypin
      institutions.&#8221; Yes, you will, we said. The life of the
      masses, history, are stronger than your protestations. If you
      won&#8217;t go, we said, history will compel you to. These were
      very Left people and after the first turn in history nothing
      remained of them as a group but smoke. Just as we proved able to
      remain revolutionaries, proved able to work under terrible
      conditions and emerge from them, so shall we emerge now because
      it is not our whim, it is objective inevitability that has
      arisen in an utterly ruined country, because in spite of our
      desires the European revolution dared to be late, and in spite
      of our desires German imperialism dared to attack. 

    </p><p> 
      Here one must know how to retreat. We cannot hide the incredibly
      bitter, deplorable reality from ourselves with empty phrases; we
      must say: God grant that we retreat in what is half-way good
      order. We cannot retreat in good order, but God grant that our
      retreat is half-way good order, that we gain a little time in
      which the sick part of our organism can be absorbed at least to
      some extent. On the whole the organism is sound, it will
      overcome its sickness; But you cannot expect it to overcome it
      all at once, instantaneously; you cannot stop an army in
      flight. When I said to one of our young friends, a would-be
      Left, &#8220;Comrade, go to the front, see what is going on in
      the army&#8221;, he took offence at this proposal. He said,
      &#8220;They want to banish us so as to prevent our agitating
      here for the great principles of a revolutionary war.&#8221; In
      making this proposal I really had no intention whatever of
      banishing factional enemies; I merely suggested that they go and
      see for themselves that the army had begun to run away in an
      unprecedented manner. We knew that even before this, even before
      this we could not close our eyes to the fact that the
      disintegration of the army had gone on to such an unheard-of
      extent that our guns were being sold to the Germans for a
      song. We knew this, just as we know that the army cannot be held
      back, and the argument that the Germans would not attack was a
      great gamble. If the European revolution is late in coming,
      gravest defeats await us because we have no army, because we
      lack organisation, because, at the moment, these are two
      problems we cannot solve. If you are unable to adapt yourself,
      if you are not inclined to crawl on your belly in the mud, you
      are not a revolutionary but a chatterbox; and I propose this,
      not because I like it, but because we have no other road,
      because history has not been kind enough to bring the revolution
      to maturity everywhere simultaneously. 

    </p><p> 
      The way things are turning out is that the civil war has begun
      as an attempt at a clash with imperialism, and this has shown
      that imperialism is rotten to the core, and that proletarian
      elements are rising in every army. Yes, we shall see the world
      revolution, but for the time being it is a very good fairy-tale,
      a very beautiful fairy-tale&#8212;I quite understand children
      liking beautiful fairy-tales. But I ask, is it proper for a
      serious revolutionary to believe in fairy-tales? There is an
      element of reality in every fairy-tale. If you told children
      fairy-tales in which the cock and the cat did not converse in
      human language they would not be interested. In the same way, if
      you tell the people that civil war will break out in Germany
      and also guarantee that instead of a clash with imperialism we
      shall have a field revolution on a world-wide scale,<a id="bk11"
      href="#fw11" name="bk11"><sup class="enote">[11]</sup></a> the
      people will say you are deceiving them. In doing this you will
      be overcoming the difficulties with which history has confronted
      us only in your own minds, by your own wishes. It will be a good
      thing if the German proletariat is able to take action. But have
      you measured it, have you discovered an instrument that will
      show that the German revolution will break out on such-and-such
      a day? No, you do not know that, and neither do we. You are
      staking everything on this card. If the revolution breaks out,
      everything is saved. Of course! But if it does not turn out as
      we desire, if it does not achieve victory tomorrow&#8212;what
      then? Then the masses will say to you, you acted like
      gamblers&#8212;you staked everything on a fortunate turn of
      events that did not take place, you proved unfitted for the
      situation that actually arose instead of the world revolution,
      which will inevitably come, but which has not yet reached
      maturity. 

    </p><p> 
      A period has set in of severe defeats, inflicted by imperial
      ism, which is armed to the teeth, upon a country which has
      demobilised its army, which had to demobilise. What I predicted
      has come to pass; instead of the Brest peace we have a much more
      humiliating peace, and the blame for this rests upon those who
      refused to accept the former peace.  We knew that through the
      fault of the army we were concluding peace with imperialism. We
      sat at the table beside <a
      href="../../../../../glossary/events/c/o.htm#congress-communist-party-russia">Hoffmann</a>
      and not <a
      href="../../../../../glossary/people/l/i.htm#karl-liebknecht">Liebknecht</a>&#8212;and
      in doing so we assisted the German revolution. But now you are
      assisting German imperialism, because you have surrendered
      wealth valued at millions in guns and shells; and anybody who
      had seen the state&#8212;the incredible state&#8212;of the army
      could have predicted this. Everyone of integrity who came from
      the front said that had the Germans made the slightest attack we
      should have perished inevitably and absolutely. We should have
      fallen prey to the enemy within a few days. 

    </p><p> 
      Having been taught this lesson, we shall overcome our split, our
      crisis, however severe the disease may be, because an
      immeasurably more reliable ally will come to our
      assistance&#8212;the world revolution. When the ratification of
      this Peace of Tilsit, this unbelievable peace, more humiliating
      and predatory than the Brest peace, is spoken of, I say:
      certainly, yes. We must do this because we look at things from
      the point of view of the masses. Any attempt to apply the
      tactics applied internally in one country between October and
      November&#8212;the triumphant period of the revolution&#8212;to
      apply them with the aid of our imagination to the progress of
      events in the world revolution, is doomed to failure. When it is
      said that the respite is a fantasy, when a newspaper called
      <em>Kommunist</em>&#8212;from the word &#8220;Commune&#8221;, I
      suppose&#8212;when this paper fills column after column with
      attempts to refute the respite theory, I say that I have lived
      through quite a lot of factional conflicts and splits and so I
      have a great deal of experience; and I must say that it is clear
      to me that this disease will not be cured by the old method of
      factional Party splits because events will cure it more
      quickly. Life is marching forward very quickly. In this respect
      it is magnificent. History is driving its locomotive so fast
      that before the editors of <em>Kommunist</em> bring out their
      next issue the majority of the workers in Petrograd will have
      begun to be disappointed in its ideas, because events are
      proving that the respite is a fact. We are now signing a peace
      treaty, we have a respite, we are taking advantage of it the
      better to defend our fatherland&#8212;because had we been at war
      we should have had an army fleeing in panic which would have had
      to be stopped, and which our comrades cannot and could not stop,
      because war is more powerful than sermons, more powerful than
      ten thousand arguments&#8212;. Since they did not understand the
      objective situation they could not hold back the army, and
      cannot do so. This sick army infected the whole organism, and
      another unparalleled defeat was inflicted upon us. German
      imperialism struck another blow at the revolution, a severe
      blow, because we allowed ourselves to face the blows of
      imperialism without machine-guns. Meanwhile, we shall take
      advantage of this breathing-space to persuade the people to
      unite and fight, to say to the Russian workers and peasants:
      &#8220;Organise self-discipline, strict discipline, otherwise
      you will have to remain lying under the German jackboot as you
      are lying now, as you will inevitably have to lie until the
      people learn to fight and to create an army capable, not of
      running away, but of bearing untold suffering.&#8221; It is
      inevitable, because the German revolution has not yet begun, and
      we cannot guarantee that it will come tomorrow. 

    </p><p> 
      That is why the respite theory, which is totally rejected in the
      flood of articles in <em>Kommunist</em>, is advanced by
      reality. Everyone can see that the respite is a fact, that
      everyone is taking advantage of it. We believed that we would
      lose Petrograd in a few days  when the advancing German troops
      were only a few days&#8217; march away, and when our best
      sailors and the Putilov workers,<span class="inote">[those
      employed at the giant Putilov Works in
      Petrograd.&#8212;Transcriber]</span> notwithstanding all their
      great enthusiasm, remained alone, when incredible chaos and
      panic broke out, which compelled our troops to flee all the way
      to Gatchina, and when we had cases of positions being recaptured
      that had never been lost&#8212;by a telegraph operator, arriving
      at the station, taking his place at the key and wiring,
      &#8220;No Germans  in sight. We have occupied the
      station.&#8221; A few hours later I received a telephone
      communication from the Commissariat of Railways informing me,
      &#8220;We have occupied the next station. We are approaching
      Yamburg. No Germans in sight. Telegraph operator at his
      post.&#8221; That is the kind of thing we had. This is the real
      history of the eleven days&#8217; war.<a id="bk12" href="#fw12"
      name="bk12"><sup class="enote">[12]</sup></a>It was described to
      us by sailors and Putilov workers, who ought to be brought to
      the Congress of Soviets. Let them tell the truth. It is a
      frightfully bitter, disappointing, painful and humiliating
      truth, but it is a hundred times more useful, it can be
      understood by the Russian people. 

    </p><p> 
      One may dream about the field revolution on a world-wide scale,
      for it will come. Everything will come in due time; but for the
      time being, set to work to establish self-discipline,
      subordination before all else, so that we can have exemplary
      order, so that the workers for at least one hour in twenty-four
      may train to fight. This is a little more difficult than
      relating beautiful fairy-tales. This is what we can do today; in
      this way you will help the German revolution, the world
      revolution. We do not know how many days the respite will last,
      but we have got it. We must demobilise the army as quickly as
      possible, because it is a sick organ; meanwhile, we will assist
      the Finnish revolution.<a id="bk13" href="#fw13"
      name="bk13"><sup class="enote">[13]</sup></a> 

    </p><p> 
      Yes, of course, we are violating the treaty; we have violated it
      thirty or forty times. Only children can fail to understand that
      in an epoch like the present, when a long painful period of
      emancipation is setting in, which has only just created and
      raised the Soviet power three stages in its
      development&#8212;only children can fail to understand that in
      this case there must be a long, circumspect struggle. The
      shameful peace treaty is rousing protest, but when comrades from
      <em>Kommunist</em> talk about war they appeal to sentiment and
      forget that the people are clenching their fists with rage, are
      &#8220;seeing red&#8221;. What do they say? &#8220;A
      class-conscious revolutionary will never live through this, will
      never submit to such a disgrace.&#8221; Their newspaper bears
      the title <em>Kommunist</em>, but it should bear the title
      <em>Szlachcic </em> <span class="inote">[Szlachcic&#8212;a
      Polish nobleman <em>&#8212;Ed.]</em></span> because it looks at
      things from the point of view of the <em>szlachcic</em> who,
      dying in a beautiful pose, sword in hand, said: &#8220;Peace is
      disgraceful, war is honourable.&#8221; They argue from the point
      of view of the <em>szlachcic </em>; I argue from the point of
      view of the peasant. 

    </p><p> 
      If I accept peace when the army is in flight, and must be in
      flight if it is not to lose thousands of men, I accept it in
      order to prevent things from getting worse. Is the treaty really
      shameful? Why, every sober-minded peasant and worker will say I
      am right, because they understand that peace is a means of
      gathering forces. History knows&#8212;I have referred to it more
      than once&#8212;the case of the liberation of the Germans from
      Napoleon after the Peace of Tilsit. I deliberately called the
      peace a Peace of Tilsit although we did not undertake to do what
      had been stipulated in that treaty, we did not undertake to
      provide troops to assist the victor to conquer other
      nations&#8212;things like that have happened in history, and
      will happen to us if we continue to place our hopes in the field
      revolution on a world-wide scale. Take care that history does
      not impose upon you this form of military slavery as well. And
      before the socialist revolution is victorious in all countries
      the Soviet Republic may be reduced to slavery. At Tilsit,
      Napoleon compelled the Germans to accept incredibly disgraceful
      peace terms. That peace had to be signed several times. The
      Hoffmann of those days&#8212;Napoleon&#8212;time and again
      caught the Germans violating the peace treaty, and the present
      Hoffmann will catch us at it. Only we shall take care that he
      does not catch us soon. 

    </p><p> 
      The last war has been a bitter, painful, but serious lesson for
      the Russian people. It has taught them to organise, to become
      disciplined, to obey, to establish a discipline that will be
      exemplary. Learn discipline from the Germans; for, if we do not,
      we, as a people, are doomed, we shall live in eternal slavery. 

    </p><p> 
      This way, and no other, has been the way of history. History
      tells us that peace is a respite for war, war is a means of
      obtaining a somewhat better or somewhat worse peace. At Brest
      the relation of forces corresponded to a peace imposed upon the
      one who has been defeated, but it was not a humiliating
      peace. The relation of forces at Pskov corresponded to a
      disgraceful, more humiliating peace; and in Petrograd and
      Moscow, at the next stage,  a peace four times more humiliating
      will be dictated to us. We do not say that the Soviet power is
      only a form, as our young Moscow friends<a id="bk14"
      href="#fw14" name="bk14"><sup class="enote">[14]</sup></a>  have
      said, we do not say that the content can be sacrificed for this
      or that revolutionary principle. We do say, let the Russian
      people understand that they must become disciplined and
      organised, and then they will be able to withstand all the
      Tilsit peace treaties. The whole history of wars of liberation
      shows that when these wars involved large masses liberation came
      quickly. We say, since history marches forward in this way, we
      shall have to abandon peace for war, and this may happen within
      the next few days. Everyone must be prepared. I have not the
      slightest shadow of doubt that the Germans are preparing near
      Narva, if it is true that it has not been taken, as all the
      newspapers say; if not in Narva, then near Narva, if not in
      Pskov, then near Pskov, the German~ are grouping their regular
      army, making ready  their railways, to capture Petrograd at the
      next jump. And this beast can jump very well. He has proved
      that. He will jump again. There is not a shadow of doubt about
      that. That is why we must be prepared, we must not brag, but
      must be able to take advantage of even a single day of respite,
      because we can take advantage of even one day&#8217;s respite to
      evacuate Petrograd, the capture of which will cause
      unprecedented suffering to hundreds of thousands of our
      proletarians. I say again that I am ready to sign, and that I
      consider it my duty to sign, a treaty twenty times, a hundred
      times more humiliating, in order to gain at least a few days in
      which to evacuate Petrograd, because by that I will alleviate
      the sufferings of the workers, who otherwise may fall under the
      yoke of the Germans; by that I facilitate the removal from
      Petrograd of all the materials, gunpowder, etc., which we need;
      because I am a defencist, because I stand for the preparation of
      an army, even in the most remote rear, where our present,
      demobilised, sick army is being healed. 

    </p><p> 
      We do not know how long the respite will last&#8212;we will try
      to take advantage of the situation. Perhaps the respite will
      last longer, perhaps it will last only a few days. Anything may
      happen, no one knows, or can know, because all the major powers
      are bound, restricted, compelled to fight on several
      fronts. Hoffmann&#8217;s behaviour is determined first by the
      need to smash the Soviet Republic; secondly, by the fact that he
      has to wage war on a number of fronts, and thirdly, by the fact
      that the revolution in Germany is maturing, is growing, and
      Hoffmann knows this. He cannot, as some assert, take Petrograd
      and Moscow this very minute. But he may do so tomorrow, that is
      quite possible. I repeat that at a moment when the army is
      obviously sick, when we are taking advantage of every
      opportunity, come what may, to get at least one day&#8217;s
      respite, we say that every serious revolutionary who is linked
      with the masses and who knows what war is, what the masses are,
      must discipline the masses, must heal them, must try to arouse
      them for a new war&#8212;every such revolutionary will admit
      that we are right, will admit that any disgraceful peace is
      proper, because it is in the interests of the proletarian
      revolution and the regeneration of Russia, because it will help
      to get rid of the sick organ. As every sensible man understands,
      by signing this peace treaty  we do not put a stop to our
      workers&#8217; revolution; everyone understands that by
      concluding peace with the Germans we do not stop rendering
      military aid; we are sending arms to the Finns, but not military
      units, which turn out to be unfit. 

    </p><p> 
      Perhaps we will accept war; perhaps tomorrow we will surrender
      even Moscow and then go over to the offensive; we will move our
      army against the enemy&#8217;s army if the necessary turn in the
      mood of the people takes place. This turn is developing and
      perhaps much time is required, but it will come, when the great
      mass of the people will not say what they are saying now. I am
      compelled to accept the harshest peace terms because I cannot
      say to myself that this time has arrived. When the time of
      regeneration arrives everyone will realise it, will see that the
      Russian is no fool; he sees, he will understand that for the
      time being we must refrain, that this slogan must be carried
      through&#8212;and this is the main task of our Party Congress
      and of the Congress of Soviets. 

    </p><p> 
      We must learn to work in a new way. That is immensely more
      difficult, but it is by no means hopeless. It will not break
      Soviet power if we do not break it ourselves by utterly
      senseless adventurism. The time will come when the people will
      say, we will not permit ourselves to be tortured any longer. But
      this will take place only if we do not agree to this adventure
      but prove able to work under harsh conditions and under the
      unprecedentedly humiliating treaty we signed the other day,
      because a war, or a peace treaty, cannot solve such a historical
      crisis. Because of their monarchic organisation the German
      people were fettered in 1807, when after several humiliating
      peace treaties, which were transformed into respites to be
      followed by new humiliations and new infringements, they signed
      the Peace of Tilsit. The Soviet organisation of the people makes
      our task easier. 

    </p><p> 
      We should have but one slogan&#8212;to learn the art of war
      properly and put the railways in order. To wage a socialist
      revolutionary war without railways would be rank treachery. We
      must produce order and we must produce all the energy and all
      the strength that will produce the best that is in the
      revolution. 

    </p><p> 
      Grasp even an hour&#8217;s respite if it is given you, in order
      to maintain contact with the remote rear and there create new
      armies. Abandon illusions for which real events have punished
      you and will punish you more severely in the future. An epoch of
      most grievous defeats is ahead of us, it is with us now, we must
      be able to reckon with it, we must be prepared for persistent
      work in conditions of illegality, in conditions of downright
      slavery to the Germans; it is no use painting it in bright
      colours, it is a real Peace of Tilsit. If we are able to act in
      this way, then, in spite of defeats, we shall be able to say
      with absolute certainty&#8212;victory will be
      ours. (<em>Applause.</em>)

      On April 18,1917, Milyukov, the Foreign Minister of the
      bourgeois Provisional Government, circulated a Note to the
      Allied Powers stating that the Provisional Government would
      observe all the tsarist treaties and undertook to continue the
      imperialist war. On April 20 the soldiers of the Petrograd
      garrison, on learning about Milyukov&#8217;s Note, demonstrated
      in the streets with the slogans &#8220;All power to the
      Soviets&#8221; and &#8220;Down with war&#8221;. On April 21 the
      Petrograd workers in response to a call made by the Bolshevik
      Party stopped work and held a demonstration. The chief demand of
      the 100,000 demonstrators was for peace. By confronting the
      broad masses with the question of &#8220;who to support?&#8221;
      and showing that only the working class by taking power could
      put an end to the war, the April demonstration hastened the
      development of the bourgeois-democratic revolution into a
      socialist revolution. The bourgeoisie replied to it with the new
      manoeuvre of forming a coalition government in which Mensheviks
      and Socialist-Revolutionaries participated.
    </p>
    
    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw3" href="#bk3" name="fw3">[3]</a>
      Lenin refers to the demonstration in Petrograd of July 3-4
      (16-17), 1917. Spontaneous demonstrations against the
      Provisional Government began in Vyborg District on July 3
      (16). The 1st Machine-Gun Regiment was the first to
      demonstrate. It was joined by other army units and factory
      workers. The demonstration threatened to develop into an armed
      attack on the Provisional Government. 

    </p><p class="endnote">
      At this time the Bolshevik Party was against an armed uprising
      because it considered that the revolutionary crisis had not yet
      matured, that the army and the provinces were not ready to
      support an uprising in the capital. At a joint meeting of the
      Central Committee with the Petrograd Committee and the Military
      Organisation of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.) at 4 p. m. on July 3 (16), it
      was decided to refrain from armed actiom The Second Petrograd
      City Conference of Bolsheviks, which was being held
      simultaneously, took an analogous decision. The conference
      delegates went out to the factories and various districts of the
      city to restrain the masses from taking armed action. But the
      uprising had already begun and it could not be stopped. 

    </p><p class="endnote">
      Taking into account the mood of the massos, the Contral
      Committee in consultation with the Petrograd Committee and the
      Military Organisation decided late in the evening on July 3 (16)
      to  participate in the demonstration in order to give it an
      organised and peaceful character. Lenin, who was not in
      Petrograd at the time, came straight to the capital when he
      heard what was happening. He arrived in the morning on July 4
      (17). More than 500,000 people took part in the demonstration of
      July 4 (17), which was conducted under the main slogan of the
      Bolsheviks, &#8220;All power to the Soviets&#8221;. 

    </p><p class="endnote">
      With the knowledge and consent of the Menshevik and
      Socialist-Revolutionary Central Executive Committee, detachments
      of officers and officer cadets were sent against the peacefully
      demonstrating workers and soldiers, and opened fire on the
      demonstrators. Counter-revolutionary military units were
      recalled from the front to smash the revolutionary movement.

    </p><p class="endnote">
      On the night of July 4 (17) the Bolshevik Central Committee
      decided to halt the demonstration. Late at night Lenin visited
      the <em>Pravda</em> editorial office to look at the current
      issue, half an hour after he left, the office was wrecked by a
      detachment of officer cadets and Cossacks.

    </p><p class="endnote">
      The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, in effect, aided
      and abetted the counter-revolution. Having helped to smash the
      demonstration, they associated themselves with the bourgeoisie
      in attacking the Bolshevik Party. The Bolshevik newspapers
      <em>Pravda</em>, <em>Soldatskaya Pravda</em> and others were
      banned by the Provisional Government. Mass arrests, searches and
      pogroms began. The revolutionary units of the Petrograd garrison
      were withdrawn from the capital and sent to the front.

    </p><p class="endnote">
      After the July Days the counter-revolutionary Provisional
      Government took over complete control of the country and the
      Soviets were reduced to the role of a helpless appendage. The
      period of dual power was over, the peaceful state of the
      revolution was also over. The Bolsheviks were now faced with the
      task of preparing an armed uprising for the overthrow of the
      Provisional Government.

      <em>Kornilov revolt</em>&#8212;a counter-revolutionary
      conspiracy organised in August 1917 by the Russian bourgeoisie and
      landowners and led by the tsarist general Kornilov. On August 25
      Kornilov began with drawing troops from the front to march against
      Petrograd. In response to a Bolshevik appeal the common people
      rose against Kornilov. The workers of Petrograd took up arms and
      began to form detachments of Red Guards. The attempt at
      counter-revolution was quickly crushed and Kornilov himself
      arrested.

      The reference is to the defeatist position taken up by
      L. B. Kamenev, G. Y. Zinoviev, A. I. Rykov and certain other
      members of the Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet
      Government, who after the October Socialist Revolution supported
      the Socialist-Revolutionary demand for the setting up of a

      <em>Kaledin</em>, <em>A. M.</em> (1861-1918) was a tsarist
      general. At the end of 1917 and the beginning of 1918 he became
      one of the leaders of the monarchist counter-revolution and
      organiser of the Civil War against Soviet power on the River
      Don. When defeated in January 1918, he shot himself.

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw7" href="#bk7" name="fw7">[7]</a> This
      argument against the signing of the peace terms dictated by

      meeting of members of the Central Committee with Party workers on
      January 8 (21), 1918. V. V. Obolensky (N. Osinsky) asserted that
      &#8220;the German soldier will not agree to take part in an
      offensive&#8221;, and Y. A. Preobrazhensky tried to prove that the
      German army was &#8220;technically incapable of advancing: winter,
      no roads . . .&#8221;. The wrongness and harmfulness of such
      arguments was exposed by Lenin in his article

      Soon after the publication of Lenin&#8217;s Decree on Peace,
      which was passed by the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets,
      the Soviet Government sent a Note to the Entente powers
      proposing the immediate conclusion of an armistice on all fronts
      and the starting of peace negotiations. The refusal of the
      imperialists of the Entente to support the initiative of the
      Soviet Government and their active opposition to the conclusion
      of peace compelled the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars to
      begin separate peace negotiations with Germany. After
      preliminary negotiations and the conclusion of an armistice, the
      peace conference opened at Brest-Litovsk on December 9 (22),
      1917. It was attended by a delegation from Soviet Russia and a
      delegation from the powers of the Quadruple Alliance (Germany,
      Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey). At the conference the
      Soviet delegation made a declaration, based on the propositions
      of the Decree on Peace, setting forth proposals for the
      conclusion of a just and democratic peace without annexations
      and indemnities. After going through a series of manoeuvres, the
      delegation from the German bloc stated that the Soviet proposals
      were inacceptable and on January 5 (18), 1918 offered Soviet
      Russia onerous and predatory peace terms stipulating that
      Poland, Lithuania and parts of Latvia, Estonia, the Ukraine and
      Byelorussia should be placed under German control.  </p><p
      class="endnote">

      On January 8 (21), 1918 at a meeting between members of the
      Central Committee and Party workers Lenin gave detailed
      arguments proving the need to conclude peace even on these
      onerous terms. These arguments were expounded in his
      &#8220;Theses on the Question of the Immediate Conclusion of a
      Separate and Annexationist Peace&#8221; (see present edition,
      Vol. 26, pp. 442-44). Questions of war and peace were discussed
      at meetings of the Central Committee on January 11 (24), January
      19 (February 1), January 21 (February 3), and on February 18,
      22, 23 and 24, 1918. To prevent the collapse of the peace
      negotiations and to stop the adventuristic policy of the
      &#8220;Left Communists&#8221; and Trotsky being put into effect,
      Lenin got the Central Committee of the Party to pass a decision
      on the need for sustaining the peace negotiations for as long as
      possible and signing the peace terms only if the Germans should
      present an ultimatum. On January 27 (February 9), however, when
      the Germans demanded in the form of an ultimatum that the Soviet
      delegation should sign the peace terms they had proposed on
      January 5 (18), Trotsky, who was leading the Soviet delegation
      at this stage, ignored the Central Committee&#8217;s decision
      and in spite of Lenin&#8217;s demand refused to sign the peace
      treaty while stating simultaneously that Russia would cease
      waging war and would demobilise her army. 

      
    </p><p class="endnote"> 
      The German imperialists took advantage of this. On February 18,
      German troops broke the armistice agreement and launched an
      offensive all along the Russo-German front. The same day, on
      Lenin&#8217;s insistence the Party Central Committee passed a
      decision to sign the peace treaty with Germany. But on February
      22, imperialist Germany presented a fresh ultimatum stipulating
      even more onerous and humiliating peace terms: in addition to
      the territory they had occupied the Germans demanded that Soviet
      Russia should cede provinces of Latvia and Estonia that were not
      in German hands, and that she should conclude peace wlth the
      Ukrainian Central Rada, withdraw Soviet troops from the Ukraine
      and Finland, pay Germany a huge indemnity and demobilise her
      army. On February 23 the Central Committee came out in favour of
      Lenin&#8217;s proposal to conclude peace immediately on the
      terms proposed by Germany. On the morning of February 24, the
      All-Russia Central Executive Committee and then the Council of
      People&#8217;s Commissars decided to accept the new peace terms,
      and this was immediately made known to the German Government. On
      March 1, 1918 the peace negotiations were reopened and the Peace
      Treaty was signed on March 3. 
 
    </p><p class="endnote"> 
      The revolution in Germany of November 1918 deposed Kaiser
      Wilhelm II and the Soviet Government was able to annul the
      Treaty of Brest.  

    </p> <p class="endnote"><a id="fw9" href="#bk9" name="fw9">[9]</a>
      The Soviet Government published the secret diplomatic papers and
      the secret treaties between the tsarist government (and
      subsequently the bourgeois Provisional Government) of Russia and
      the governments of Britain, Franco, Italy, Japan,
      Austria-Hungary and otber imperialist powers, On November 10
      (23), 1917 the newspapers began publishing these secret
      diplomatic papers and treaties, which afterwards appeared in the
      <em>Collections of Secret Documents from the Archives of the
      Former Ministry for Foreign Affairs.</em> Seven of these
      collections came out between December 1917 and February 1918.

      The reference is to the signed oath of loyalty to the tsar that
      was obligatory for deputies of the Third State Duma. Since refusal
      to take this oath meant losing the platform in the Duma that was
      needed to mobilise the proletariat for revolutionary struggle, the
      Social-Democrat deputies signed the oath along with the rest of
      the members of the Duma.

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw11" href="#bk11" name="fw11">[11]</a> 
      The term &#8220;fleld revolution on a world-wide scale&#8221;
      was used by V. V. Obolensky (N. Osinsky) in the &#8220;Theses on
      the Question of War and Peace&#8221;, which he wrote for the
      meeting of the Party Central Committee on January 21 (February 3),
      1918 and published on March 14 in the &#8220;Left Communist&#8221;
      newspaper <em>Kommunist</em> No. 8. Explaining what he meant by
      this term, Obolensky wrote: &#8220;Revolutionary war, as a field
      civil war, cannot resemble in character the regular military
      actions of national armies when they are carrying out strategic
      operations. . . . Military action assumes the character of
      guerrilla warfare (analogous to barricade fighting) and is mixed
      with class agitation.&#8221; 

    </p> 
    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw12" href="#bk12" name="fw12">[12]</a> 
      Lenin appears to be referring to the period between the
      launching of the German offensive, on February 18, and the arrival
      of the Soviet delegation in Brest-Litovsk on February 28,
      1918. The German offensive continued until March 3, the day the
      peace treaty was signed.

      The revolution in Finland which began on January 27, 1918 in
      response to a call from the leaders of the Social-Democratic Party
      of Finland, deposed Svinhufvud&#8217;s bourgeois government and
      placed power in the hands of the workers. On January 29 a
      revolutionary government of Finland was set up in the shape of the
      Council of People&#8217;s Representatives, which included
      E. Gylling, O. W. Kuusinen, Y. Sirola, A. Taimi and othcrs. This
      government&#8217;s most important acts were the passing of a law
      making land less peasants sole owners of the land they tilled, the
      freeing of the poorest sections of the population of all taxes the
      expropriation of enterprises belonging to owners who had fled the
      country, and the setting up of state control over private banks. 
      
    </p><p class="endnote">
      The proletarian revolution was victorious, however, only in the
      south of Finland. The Svinhufvud government made good its losses
      in the north of the country, where a build-up of
      counter-revolutionary forces took place, and appealed to the
      government of Kaiser Germany for aid. On May 2, 1918 German
      armed forces intervened and the workers&#8217; revolution was
      crushed after a bitter civil was lasting three months. During
      the White Terror that ensued thousands of revolutionary workers
      and peasants were executed or tortured to death in prison.
