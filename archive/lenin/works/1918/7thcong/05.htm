    <h2>V. I. Lenin</h2>
    <h3>Extraordinary Seventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) </h3>

    <h2> MARCH 6-8, 1918 </h2>
    <h3>Section Five</h3>
    <hr  />

    <h2>5</h2>

    <h3>Speech Against The Statement Of The &#8220;Left Communist&#8221; Group In Support Of
    Trotsky&#8217;s Amendment<br />
     March 8</h3>
    <br />
    <br />

    <p>I am unable to give an immediate answer to Comrade Radek&#8217;s polemic<a id="bk22"
    href="#fw22" name="bk22"><sup class="enote">[22]</sup></a>&#8212;since I am not voting, I
    cannot give grounds for my vote. According to the usual procedure, I cannot reply; I do not
    want to hold up the Congress by requesting to be given the floor in order to reply to this
    polemic. I merely remind you, therefore, of what was said in my reply to the debate and,
    secondly, register my protest against a speech on grounds for voting being turned into a
    polemic to which I am not in a position to reply.</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw22" href="#bk22" name="fw22">[22]</a> K. Radek made a statement
      on behalf of the group of &#8220;Left Communists&#8221;, in which he tried to continue the
      polemic over the question of war and peace.</p>
