    <h2>V. I. Lenin</h2>
    <h3>Extraordinary Seventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) </h3>

    <h2> MARCH 6-8, 1918 </h2>
    <h3>Section Eight</h3>
    <hr  />

    <h2>8</h2>

    <h3>Proposal Concerning The Resolution On War And Peace<br />
     March 8</h3>

    <h2>I</h2>

    <p>In view of the fact that the resolution has been distributed, can we not at once adopt a
      decision that everyone who has received a copy should bring it to this table immediately?
      That is one means of preserving a military secret.</p>

    <h2>II</h2>

    <p>I ask for the vote to be taken. Our Party centres consist of adult people who will
      understand that communications containing a military secret are made orally. Therefore I
      absolutely insist that all texts of the resolution in anyone&#8217;s possession shall
      immediately be put on the table here.</p>
