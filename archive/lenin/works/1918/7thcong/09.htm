     March 8</h3>
    <br />
    <br />

    <p>Comrades, as you know, a fairly comprehensive Party discussion on changing the name of the
    Party has developed since April 1917 and the Central Committee has therefore been able to
    arrive at an immediate decision that will probably not give rise to considerable
    dispute&#8212;there may even be practically none at all; the Central Committee proposes to
    you that the name of our Party be changed to the Russian Communist Party, with the word
    &#8220;Bolsheviks&#8221; added to it in brackets. We all recognise the necessity for this
    addition because the word &#8220;Bolshevik&#8221; has not only acquired rights of citizenship
    in the political life of Russia but also throughout the entire foreign press, which in a
    general way keeps track of events in Russia. It has already been explained in our press that
    the name &#8220;Social-Democratic Party&#8221; is scientifically incorrect. When the workers
    set up their own state they realised that the old concept of democracy&#8212;bourgeois
    democracy&#8212;had been surpassed in the process of the development of our revolution. We
    have arrived at a type of democracy that has never existed anywhere in Western Europe. It has
    its prototype only in the Paris Commune, and Engels said with regard to the Paris Commune
    that it was not a state in the proper sense of the word.<a id="bk25" href="#fw25"
    name="bk25"><sup class="enote">[25]</sup></a> In short, since the working people themselves
    are undertaking to administer the state and establish armed forces that support the given
    state system, the special government apparatus is disappearing, the special apparatus for a
    certain state coercion is disappearing, and we cannot therefore uphold democracy in its old
    form.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, as we begin socialist reforms we must have a clear conception of the
    goal towards which these reforms are in the final analysis directed, that is, the creation of
    a communist society that does not limit itself to the expropriation of factories, the land
    and the means of production, does not confine itself to strict accounting for, and control
    of, production and distribution of products, but goes farther towards implementing the
    principle &#8220;From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs&#8221;.
    That is why the name of Communist Party is the only one that is scientifically correct. The
    objection that it may cause us to be confused with the anarchists was immediately rejected by
    the Central Committee on the grounds that the anarchists never call themselves simply
    Communists but always add something to that name. In this respect we may mention the many
    varieties of socialism, but they do not cause the confusion of the Social-Democrats with
    social reformers, or national socialists, or any similar parties.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the most important argument in favour of changing the name of the Party
    is that up to now the old official socialist parties in all the leading European countries
    have still not got rid of their intoxication with social-chauvinism and social-patriotism
    that led to the complete collapse of European official socialism during the present war, so
    that up to now almost all official socialist parties have been a real hindrance to the
    working-class revolutionary socialist movement, a real encumbrance to it. And our Party,
    which at the present time undoubtedly enjoys the greatest sympathy of the masses of the
    working people of all countries&#8212;our Party must make the most decisive, sharp, clear and
    unambiguous statement that is possible to the effect that it has broken off connections with
    that old official socialism, for which purpose a change in the name of the Party will be the
    most effective means.</p>

    <p>Further, comrades, the much more difficult question was that of the theoretical part of
    the Programme and of its practical and political part. As far as the theoretical part of the
    Programme is concerned, we have some material&#8212;the Moscow and Petrograd symposia on the
    review of the Programme, which have been published<a id="bk26" href="#fw26" name="bk26"><sup
    class="enote">[26]</sup></a>; the two main theoretical organs of our Party, <em><a
    href="../../../../../glossary/periodicals/p/r.htm#prosveshcheniye">Prosveshcheniye</a></em>
    published in Petrograd, and 

      <em><a href="../../../../../glossary/periodicals/s/p.htm#spartak">Spartak</a></em>

	published in Moscow, have carried articles substantiating
      certain trends in changing the theoretical part of the Programme
      of our Party. In this sphere we have a certain amount of
      material. Two main points of view are to be seen which, in my
      opinion, do not diverge, at any rate radically, on matters of
      principle; one point of view, the one I defended, is that we
      have no reason to reject the old theoretical part of our
      Programme, and that it would be actually incorrect to do so. We
      have only to add to it an analysis of imperialism as the highest
      stage of the development of capitalism and also an analysis of
      the era of the socialist revolution, proceeding from the fact
      that the era of the socialist revolution has begun. Whatever may
      be the fate of our revolution, of our contingent of the
      international proletarian army, whatever may be the future
      complications of the revolution, the objective situation of the
      imperialist countries embroiled in a war that has reduced the
      most advanced countries to starvation, ruin and barbarity, that
      situation, in any case, is hopeless. And here I must repeat what
      Frederick Engels said thirty years ago, in 1887, when appraising
      the probable prospects of a European war. He said that crowns
      would lie around in Europe by the dozen and nobody would want to
      pick them up; he said that incredible ruin would fall to the lot
      of the European countries, and that there could be only one
      outcome to the horrors of a European war -- he put it this
      way&#8212;&#8220;either the victory of the working class or the
      creation of conditions that would make that victory possible and
      necessary&#8221;.<a id="bk27" href="#fw27" name="bk27"><sup
      class="enote">[27]</sup></a> Engels expressed himself on this
      score with exceptional precision and caution. Unlike those
      people who distort Marxism and offer their belated
      pseudo-philosophising about socialism being impossible in
      conditions of ruin, Engels realised full well that every war,
      even in an advanced society, would create not only devastation,
      barbarity, torment, calamities for the masses, who would drown
      in blood, and that there could be no guarantee that it would
      lead to the victory of socialism; he said it would be
      &#8220;either the victory of the working class or the creation
      of conditions that would make that victory possible and
      necessary&#8221;, i.e., that there was, consequently, the
      possibility of a number of difficult stages of transition in
      view of the tremendous destruction of culture and the means of
      production, but that the result could be only the rise of the
      working class, the vanguard of all working people, and the
      beginning of its taking over power into its own hands for the
      creation of a socialist society. For no matter to what extent
      culture has been destroyed, it cannot be removed from history;
      it will be difficult to restore but no destruction will ever
      mean the complete disappearance of that culture. Some part of
      it, some material remains of that culture will be
      indestructible, the difficulties will be only in restoring
      it. There you have one point of view&#8212;that we must retain
      the old Programme and add to it an analysis of imperialism and
      of the beginning of the social revolution.</p>

    <p>I expressed that point of view in the draft Programme that I
      have published [See 

      <em><a href="../../1917/reviprog/index.htm" onblur="t">Materials Relating
	  to the Revision of the Party Programme</a></em>].

      Another draft was published by Comrade Sokolnikov in the Moscow
      symposium. The second point of view has been expressed in our
      private conversations, in particular by Comrade Bukharin, and by
      Comrade V. Smirnov in the press, in the Moscow symposium. This
      point of view is that the old theoretical part of our Programme
      should be completely or almost completely eliminated and
      replaced by a new part that does not analyse the development of
      commodity production and capitalism, as the present Programme
      does, but analyses the contemporary, highest stage of capitalist
      development&#8212;imperialism&#8212;and the immediate transition
      to the epoch of the social revolution. I do not think that these
      two points of view diverge radically and in principle, but I
      shall defend my point of view. It seems to me that it would be
      theoretically incorrect to eliminate the old programme that
      analyses the development from commodity production to
      capitalism. There is nothing incorrect in it. That is how things
      were and how they are, for commodity production begot capitalism
      and capitalism led to imperialism. Such is the general
      historical perspective, and the fundamentals of socialism should
      not be forgotten. No matter what the further complications of
      the struggle may be, no matter what occasional zigzags we may
      have to contend with (there will be very many of them&#8212; we
      have seen from experience what gigantic turns the history of the
      revolution has made, and so far it is only in our own country;
      matters will be much more complicated and proceed much more
      rapidly, the rate of development will be more furious and the
      turns will be more intricate when the revolution becomes a
      European revolution)&#8212;in order not to lose our way in these
      zigzags, these sharp turns in history, in order to retain the
      general perspective, to be able to see the scarlet thread that
      joins up the entire development of capitalism and the entire
      road to socialism, the road we naturally imagine as straight,
      and which we must imagine as straight in order to see the
      beginning, the continuation and the end&#8212;in real life it
      will never be straight, it will be incredibly involved&#8212;in
      order not to lose our way in these twists and turns, in order
      not to get lost at times when we are taking steps backward,
      times of retreat and temporary defeat or when history or the
      enemy throws us back&#8212;in order not to get lost, it is, in
      my opinion, important not to discard our old, basic Programme;
      the only theoretically correct line is to retain it. Today we
      have reached only the first stage of transition from capitalism
      to socialism here in Russia. History has not provided us with
      that peaceful situation that was theoretically assumed for a
      certain time, and which is desirable for us, and which would
      enable us to pass through these stages of transition
      speedily. We see immediately that the civil war has made many
      things difficult in Russia, and that the civil war is interwoven
      with a whole series of wars. Marxists have never forgotten that
      violence must inevitably accompany the collapse of capitalism in
      its entirety and the birth of socialist society. That violence
      will constitute a period of world history, a whole era of
      various kinds of wars, imperialist. wars, civil wars inside
      countries the intermingling of the two, national wars liberating
      the nationalities oppressed by the imperialists and by various
      combinations of imperialist powers that will inevitably enter
      into various alliances in the epoch of tremendous
      state-capitalist and military trusts and syndicates. This epoch,
      an epoch of gigantic cataclysms, of mass decisions forcibly
      imposed by war, of crises, has begun&#8212;that we can see
      clearly&#8212;and it is only the beginning. We therefore have no
      reason to discard everything bearing on the definition of
      commodity production in general, of capitalism in gen- eral. We
      have only just taken the first steps towards shaking off
      capitalism altogether and beginning the transition to
      socialism. We do not know and we cannot know how many stages of
      transition to socialism there will be. That depends on when the
      full-scale European socialist revolution begins and on whether
      it will deal with its enemies and enter upon the smooth path of
      socialist development easily and rapidly or whether it will do
      so slowly. We do not know this, and the programme of a Marxist
      party must be based on facts that have been established with
      absolute certainty.  The power of our Programme&#8212;the
      programme that has found its confirmation in all the
      complications of the revolution&#8212;is in that alone. Marxists
      must build up their programme on this basis alone. We must
      proceed from facts that have been established with absolute
      certainty, facts that show how the development of exchange and
      commodity production became a dominant historical phenomenon
      throughout the world, how it led to capitalism and capitalism
      developed into imperialism; that is an absolutely definite fact
      that must first and foremost be recorded in our Programme. That
      imperialism begins the era of the social revolution is also a
      fact, one that is obvious to us, and about which we must speak
      clearly.  By stating this fact in our Programme we are holding
      high the torch of the social revolution before the whole world,
      not as an agitational speech, but as a new Programme that says
      to the peoples of Western Europe, &#8220;Here is what you and we
      have gathered from the experience of capitalist
      development. This is what capitalism was, this is how it
      developed into imperialism, and here is the epoch of the social
      revolution that is beginning, and in which it is our lot to
      play, chronologically, the first role.&#8221; We shall proclaim
      this manifesto before all civilised countries; it will not only
      be a fervent appeal but will be substantiated with absolute
      accuracy and will derive from facts recognised by all socialist
      parties. It will make all the clearer the contradiction between
      the tactics of those parties that have now betrayed socialism
      and the theoretical premises which we all share, and which have
      entered the flesh and blood of every class-conscious
      worker&#8212;the rise of capitalism and its development into
      imperialism. On the eve of imperialist wars the congresses at
      Chemnitz and Basle passed resolutions defining imperialism, and
      there is a flagrant contradiction between that definition and
      the present tactics of the social-traitors..<a id="bk28"
      href="#fw28" name="bk28"><sup class="enote">[28]</sup></a> We
      must, therefore, repeat that which is basic in order to show the
      working people of Western Europe all the more clearly what we
      accuse their leaders of.</p>

    <p>Such is the basis which I consider to be the only theoretically correct one on which to
      build a programme. The abandoning of the analysis of commodity production and capitalism as
      though it were old rubbish is not dictated by the historical nature of what is now happening,
      since we have not gone farther than the first steps in the transition from capitalism to
      socialism, and our transition is made more intricate by features that are specific to Russia
      and do not exist in most civilised countries. And so it is not only possible but inevitable
      that the stages of transition will be different in Europe; it would be theoretically
      incorrect to turn all attention to specific national stages of transition that are essential
      to us but may not be essential in Europe. We must begin with the general basis of the
      development of commodity production, the transition to capitalism and the growth of
      capitalism into imperialism. In this way we shall occupy and strengthen a theoretical
      position from which nobody without betraying socialism can shift us. From this we draw the
      equally inevitable conclusion&#8212;the era of the social revolution is beginning.</p>
    
    <p>We draw this conclusion without departing from our basis of definitely proved facts.</p>

    <p>Following this, our task is to define the Soviet type of state. I have tried to outline
      theoretical views on this question in my book 

      <em><a href="../../1917/staterev/index.htm" onblur="t">The State and
	     Revolution</a></em>.

      It seems to me that the Marxist view on the state has been
      distorted in the highest degree by the official socialism that
      is dominant in Western Europe, and that this has been splendidly
      confirmed by the experience of the Soviet revolution and the
      establishment of the Soviets in Russia. There is much that is
      crude and unfinished in our Soviets, there is no doubt about
      that, it is obvious to everyone who examines their work; but
      what is important, has historical value and is a step forward in
      the world development of socialism, is that they are a new type
      of state. The Paris Commune was a matter of a few weeks, in one
      city, without the people being conscious of what they were
      doing. The Commune was not understood by those who created it;
      they established the Commune by following the unfailing instinct
      of the awakened people, and neither of the groups of French
      socialists was conscious of what it was doing. Because we are
      standing on the shoulders of the Paris Commune and the many
      years of development of German Social-Democracy, we have
      conditions that enable us to see clearly what we are doing in
      creating Soviet power. Despite all the crudity and lack of
      discipline that exist in the Soviets&#8212;this is a survival of
      the petty-bourgeois nature of our country&#8212;despite all that
      the new type of state has been created by the masses of the
      people. It has been functioning for months and not weeks, and
      not in one city, but throughout a tremendous country, populated
      by several nations. This type of Soviet power has shown its
      value since it has spread to Finland, a country that is
      different in every respect, where there are no Soviets but where
      there is, at any rate, a new type of power, proletarian power.<a
      id="bk29" href="#fw29" name="bk29"><sup
      class="enote">[29]</sup></a> This is, therefore, proof of what
      is theoretically regarded as indisputable&#8212;that Soviet
      power is a new type of state without a bureaucracy, without
      police, without a regular army, a state in which bourgeois
      democracy has been replaced by a new democracy, a democracy that
      brings to the fore the vanguard of the working people, gives
      them legislative and executive authority, makes them responsible
      for military defence and creates state machinery that can
      re-educate the masses.</p>

    <p>In Russia this has scarcely begun and has begun badly. If we are conscious of what is bad
    in what we have begun we shall overcome it, provided history gives anything like a decent
    time to work on that Soviet power. I am therefore of the opinion that a definition of the new
    type of state should occupy an outstanding place in our Programme. Unfortunately we had to
    work on our Programme in the midst of governmental work and under conditions of such great
    haste that we were not even able to convene our commission, to elaborate an official draft
    programme. What has been distributed among the delegates is only a rough sketch, and this
    will be obvious to everyone. A fairly large amount of space has been allotted in it to the
    question of Soviet power, and I think that it is here that the international significance of
    our Programme will make itself felt. I think it would be very wrong of us to confine the
    international significance of our revolution to slogans, appeals, demonstrations, manifestos,
    etc. That is not enough. We must show the European workers exactly what we have set about,
    how we have set about it, how it is to be understood; that will bring them face to face with
    the question of how socialism is to be achieved. They must see for themselves&#8212;the
    Russians have started on something worth doing; if they are setting about it badly we must do
    it better. For that purpose we must provide as much concrete material as possible and say
    what we have tried to create that is new. We have a new type of state in Soviet power; we
    shall try to outline its purpose and structure, we shall try to explain why this new type of
    democracy in which there is so much that is chaotic and irrational, to explain what makes up
    its living spirit&#8212;the transfer of power to the working people, the elimination of
    exploitation and the machinery of suppression. The state is the machinery of suppression. The
    exploiters must be suppressed, but they cannot be suppressed by police, they must be
    suppressed by the masses themselves, the machinery must be linked with the masses, must
    represent them as the Soviets do. They are much closer to the masses, they provide an
    opportunity to keep closer to the masses, they provide greater opportunities for the
    education of those masses. We know very well that the Russian peasant is anxious to learn;
    and we want him to learn, not from books, but from his own experience. Soviet power is
    machinery, machinery that will enable the masses to begin right away learning to govern the
    state and organise production on a nation-wide scale. It is a task of tremendous difficulty.
    It is, however, historically important that we are setting about its fulfilment, and not only
    from the point of view of our one country; we are calling upon European workers to help. We
    must give a concrete explanation of our Programme from precisely that common point of view.
    That is why we consider it a continuation of the road taken by the Paris Commune. That is why
    we are confident that the European workers will be able to help once they have entered on
    that path. They will do what we are doing, but do it better, and the centre of gravity will
    shift from the formal point of view to the concrete conditions. In the old days the demand
    for freedom of assembly was a particularly important one, whereas our point of view on
    freedom of assembly is that nobody can now prevent meetings, and Soviet power has only to
    provide premises for meetings. General proclamations of broad principles are important to the
    bourgeoisie: &#8220;All citizens have freedom to assemble, but they must assemble in the
    open, we shall not give them premises.&#8221; But we say: &#8220;Fewer empty phrases, and
    more substance.&#8221; The palaces must be expropriated&#8212;not only the Taurida Palace,
    but many others as well&#8212;and we say nothing about freedom of assembly. That must be
    extended to all other points in the democratic programme. We must be our own judges. All
    citizens must take part in the work of the courts and in the government of the country. It is
    important for us to draw literally all working people into the government of the state. It is
    a task of tremendous difficulty. But socialism cannot be implemented by a minority, by the
    Party. It can be implemented only by tens of millions when they have learned to do it
    themselves. We regard it as a point in our favour that we are trying to help the masses
    themselves set about it immediately, and not to learn to do it from books and lectures. If we
    state these tasks of ours clearly and definitely we shall thereby give an impetus to the
    discussion of the question and its practical presentation by the European masses. We are
    perhaps making a bad job of what has to be done, but we are urging the masses to do what they
    have to. If what our revolution is doing is not accidental (and we are firmly convinced that
    it is not), if it is not the product of a Party decision but the inevitable product of any
    revolution that Marx called &#8220;popular&#8221;, i.e., a revolution that the masses
    themselves create by their slogans, their efforts and not by a repetition of the programme of
    the old bourgeois republic&#8212;if we present matters in this way, we shall have achieved
    the most important thing. And here we come to the question of whether we should abolish the
    difference between the maximum and minimum programmes. Yes and no. I do not fear this
    abolition, because the viewpoint we held in summer should no longer exist. I said then, when
    we still had not taken power, that it was &#8220;too soon&#8221;, but now that we have taken
    power and tested it, it is not too soon.[See 

      <em><a href="../../1917/oct/06.htm" onblur="t">Revision of
	  the Party Programmed</a></em>]

      In place of the old Programme we must now write a new
    Programme of Soviet power and not in any way reject the use of bourgeois parliamentarism. It
    is a utopia to think that we shall not be thrown back.</p>

    <p>It cannot be denied historically that Russia has created a Soviet Republic. We say that if
    ever we are thrown back, while not rejecting the use of bourgeois parliamentarism&#8212;if
    hostile class forces drive us to that old position&#8212;we shall aim at what has been gained
    by experience, at Soviet power, at the Soviet type of state, at the Paris Commune type of
    state. That must be expressed in the Programme. In place of the minimum programme, we shall
    introduce the Programme of Soviet power. A definition of the new type of state must occupy an
    important place in our Programme.</p>

    <p>It is obvious that we cannot elaborate a programme at the moment. We must work out its
    basic premises and hand them over to a commission or to the Central Committee for the
    elaboration of the main theses. Or still more simply&#8212;the elaboration is possible on the
    basis of the resolution on the Brest-Litovsk Conference, which has already provided
    theses. 

      [See <a href="02.htm" onblur="t">here</a>]

      Such a definition of Soviet power should be given on
    the basis of the experience of the Russian revolution, and followed by a proposal for
    practical reforms. I think it is here, in the historical part, that mention should be made
    that the expropriation of the land and of industrial enterprises has begun.<a id="bk30"
    href="#fw30" name="bk30"><sup class="enote">[30]</sup></a> Here we shall present the concrete
    task of organising distribution, unifying the banks into one universal type and converting
    them into a network of state institutions covering the whole country and providing us with
    public book-keeping, accounting and control carried out by the population itself and forming
    the foundation for further socialist steps. I think that this part, being the most difficult,
    should be formulated as the concrete demands of our Soviet power&#8212;what we want to do at
    the moment, what reforms we intend to carry out in the sphere of banking policy, the
    organisation of production, the organisation of exchange, accountancy and control, the
    introduction of labour conscription, etc. When we are able to, we shall add what great or
    small measures or half-measures we have taken in that direction. Here we must state with
    absolute precision and clarity what has been begun and what has not been completed. We know
    full well that a large part of what has been begun has not been completed. Without any
    exaggeration, with full objectivity, without departing from the facts, we must state in our
    Programme what we have done and what we want to do. We shall show the European proletariat
    this truth and say, this must be done, so that they will say, such-and-such things the
    Russians are doing badly but we shall do them better. When this urge reaches the masses the
    socialist revolution will be invincible. The imperialist war is proceeding before the eyes of
    all people, a war that is nothing but a war of plunder. When the imperialist war exposes
    itself in the eyes of the world and becomes a war waged by all the imperialists against
    Soviet power, against socialism, it will give the proletariat of the West yet another push
    forward. That must be revealed, the war must be described as an alliance of the imperialists
    against the socialist movement . These are the general considerations that think should be
    shared with you, and on the basis of which I now make the practical proposal to exchange
    basic views on that question and then, perhaps, elaborate a few fundamental theses here on
    the spot, and, if that should be found difficult, give up the idea and hand the question of
    the Programme over to the Central Committee or to a special commission that will be
    instructed, on the basis of the material available and of the shorthand or secretaries&#8217;
    detailed reports of the Congress, to draw up a Programme for the Party, which must
    immediately change its name. I am of the opinion that we can do this at the present time, and
    I think everybody will agree that with our Programme in the editorially unprepared state in
    which events found it, there is nothing else we can do. I am sure we can do this in a few
    weeks. We have a sufficient number of theoreticians in all the trends of our Party to obtain
    a programme in a few weeks. There may be much that is erroneous in it, of course, to say
    nothing of editorial and stylistic inaccuracies. because we have not got months in which to
    settle down to it with the composure that is necessary for editorial work.</p>

    <p>We shall correct all these errors in the course of our work in the full confidence that we
    are giving Soviet power an opportunity to implement the programme. If we at least state
    precisely, without departing from reality, that Soviet power is a new type of state, a form
    of the dictatorship of the proletariat, that we present democracy with different tasks, that
    we have translated the tasks of socialism from a general abstract formula&#8212;&#8220;the
    expropriation of the expropriators&#8221;&#8212;into such concrete formulas as the
    nationalisation of the banks<a id="bk31" href="#fw31" name="bk31"><sup
    class="enote">[31]</sup></a> and the land, that will be an important part of the
    Programme.</p>

    <p>The land question must be reshaped so that we can see in it the first steps of the small
    peasantry wanting to take the side of the proletariat and help the socialist revolution, see
    how the peasants, for all their prejudices and all their old convictions, have set themselves
    the practical task of the transition to socialism. This is a fact, although we shall not
    impose it on other countries. The peasantry have shown, not in words but by their deeds, that
    they wish to help and are helping the proletariat that has taken power to put socialism into
    effect. It is wrong to accuse us of wanting to introduce socialism by force. We shall divide
    up the land justly, mainly from the point of view of the small farm. In doing this we give
    preference to communes and big labour co-operatives.<a id="bk32" href="#fw32"
    name="bk32"><sup class="enote">[32]</sup></a> We support the monopolising of the grain trade.
    We support, the peasantry have said, the confiscation of banks and factories. We are prepared
    to help the workers in implementing socialism. I think a fundamental law on the socialisation
    of the land should be published in all languages. This will be done, if it has not been done
    already.<a id="bk33" href="#fw33" name="bk33"><sup class="enote">[33]</sup></a> That is an
    idea we shall state concretely in the Programme&#8212;it must be expressed theoretically
    without departing one single step from concretely established facts. It will be done
    differently in the West. Perhaps we are making mistakes, but we hope that the proletariat of
    the West will correct them. And we appeal to the European proletariat to help us in our
    work.</p>

    <p>In this way we can work out our Programme in a few weeks, and the mistakes we make will be
    corrected as time goes on&#8212;we shall correct them ourselves. Those mistakes will be as
    light as feathers compared with the positive results that will be achieved.</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw24" href="#bk24" name="fw24">[24]</a> The question of revising
    the Party Programme was put forward by Lenin after the bourgeois-democratic revolution of
    February 1917. In his &#8220;Rough Draft for the Fifth <em>Letter from Afar</em> &#8221; he
    defined the basic directions in which the Programme should be changed, and added that
    &#8220;this work must be started at once&#8221;. Lenin developed the propositions contained
    in this draft in his April Theses, in his report on the question
    of 

      <a href="../../1917/reviprog/index.htm" onblur="t">revising the Party Programme at the Seventh
    (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)</a>

      and in other documents (see present
    edition, Vol. 24, pp. 277-79;. For the April Conference Lenin
    wrote the 

      <a href="../../1917/reviprog/ch02.htm" onblur="t">Proposed Amendments to the Doctrinal, Political
    and Other Sections of the Programme</a>,

      which contained a number of amendments to the
    R.S.D.L.P. Programme of 1903. The proofs of this draft were handed out to delegates to the
    April Conference, which gave the Central Committee two months to draw up a draft Party
    Programme for the Sixth Party Congress.</p>

    <p class="endnote">The Sixth Congress of the R.S.D.I,.P.(B.), which sat from July 26 to
    August 3 (August 8-16), 1917, endorsed the decision of the April Conference on the need to
    revise the Programme and instruct- ed the Central Committee to organise a broad discussion on
    the problems involved (see <em>The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of
    Congresses</em>, <em>Conferences and Plenums of the Central Committee</em>, Part I, Russ.
    ed., 1954, pp. 387-88). Before the Congress opened, in June 1917 a pamphlet prepared by Lenin
    on the Central Committee&#8217;s instructions and called <em>Materials Relating to the
    Revision of the Party Programme</em>, was published; it contained all the Programme materials
    in the possession of the Central Committee. Almost simultaneously the Regional Bureau of the
    Moscow Industrial Area of the R.S.D.L.P. published &#8220;Materials Relating to the Revision
    of the Party Programme. Collected Articles by V. Milyutin, G. Sokolnikov, A. Lomov and V.
    Smirnov&#8221;. A theoretical discussion developed within the Party in the summer and autumn
    of 1917. A critical analysis of the articles that had appeared in the periodical press and
    the Moscow collection was given by Lenin in his article &#8220;Revision of the Party
    Programme &#8221;, published in October 1917, in the magazine <em>Prosveshcheniye</em> No.
    1-2 (see present edition, Vol. 26, pp. 149-78).</p>

    <p class="endnote">After several discussions on the question of tho Party Programme, the
    Central Committee at a meeting on October 5 (18), 1917 set up under Lenin&#8217;s
    chairmanship a commission to revise the Party Programme for the next Party Congress which was
    due to be held in the autumn of 1917. Eventually, by a decision of the Central Committee of
    January 24 (February 6), 1918 the drafting of the new Programme was entrusted to a new
    commission also headed by Lenin. Lenin wrote the &#8220;Rough Outline of the Draft
    Programme&#8221;, which was handed out to the delegates to the Seventh Congress as material
    for discussion. The Congress did not, however, discuss the Programme in detail; the drafting
    of the final version was entrusted to a seven-man commission elected by the Congress. The
    commission was headed by Lenin. The Congress charged the commission to be guided in its
    revision of the Programme by the instructions laid down in Lenin&#8217;s resolution, which
    had been unanimously adopted by the Congress. The new, second Party Programme was passed only
    by the Eighth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) in March 1919.</p>

    <p class="endnote">The question of changing the name of the, Party had been raised by Lenin
    as early as 1914, at the beginning of the First World War (see present edition, Vol. 21, p.
    93;. Lenin showed why this was necessary in his 

      <a href="../../1917/tasks/index.htm" onblur="t">April Theses and in the
	pamphlet</a>

      and in a number
    of other works and speechs in 1917. In the April Theses Lenin wrote: &#8220;Instead of
    &#8217;Social-Democracy&#8217;, whose official leaders <em>throughout</em> the world have
    betrayed socialism and deserted to the bourgeoisie (the &#8217;defencists&#8217; and the
    vacillating &#8217;Kautskyites&#8217;), we must call ourselves the <em>Communist
    Party.</em>&#8221;</p>

    <p class="endnote">This question was not considered at the April Conference of the
    R.S.D.L.P.(B.) of 1917 or at the Sixth Party Congress. The decision to change the name of the
    Party was taken only at the Seventh Party Congress, at which Lenin made a report on the
    subject.</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw25" href="#bk25" name="fw25">[25]</a> Lenin is referring to a
    proposition put forward by Engels in a letter to August Bebel of March 18-28, 1875 (see Karl
    Marx and Frederick Engels, <em>Selected Correspondence</em>, 1953, p. 357).</p>

    Petrograd, Priboi Publishers, 1917 and <em>Materials Relating to the Revision of the Party
    Programme.</em> Collected Articles by V. Milyutin, G. Sokolnikov, A. Lomov und V. Smirnov.
    Published by the Regional Bureau of the Moscow Industrial Area of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.),
    1917.</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw27" href="#bk27" name="fw27">[27]</a> Lenin is giving an account
    of <em>Introduction to Borkheim&#8217;s Pamphlet &#8220;In Memory of the German Arch-Patriots
    of 1806-1807&#8221;</em>, written by Engels on December 15, 1887 (Marx/Engels,
    <em>Werke</em>, Band 21, S. 351, Dietz Verlag, Berlin, 1962). Lenin refers more fully to
    Engels&#8217;s propositions in the article &#8220;Prophetic Words&#8221; (see this volume,
    pp. 494-99).</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw28" href="#bk28" name="fw28">[28]</a> Chemnitz Congress of the
    German Social-Democrats, of September 15-21, 1912, passed a resolution &#8220;On
    Imperialism&#8221;, in which it described the policy of the imperialist states as a
    &#8220;barefaced policy of robbery and aggression&#8221; and called on the working class
    &#8220;to fight with redoubled energy against imperialism until it is overthrown&#8221;.</p>

    <p class="endnote"><em>Basle Extraordinary International Socialist Congress</em> (November
    24-25, 1912) unanimously adopted a manifesto calling on the workers of all countries to wage
    a resolute flght for peace and to &#8220;pit against the might of capitalist imperialism the
    international solidarity of the working class&#8221;. The manifesto recommended that if
    imperialist war broke out, socialists should use the economic and political crisis it would
    cause in the struggle for a socialist revolution.</p>

    <p class="endnote">During the world imperialist war of 1914-18 the leaders of the
    Social-Democratic parties in the countries of Western Europe broke the decisions of the
    international socialist congresses, aescended to positions of social-chauvinism and sided
    with their imperialist governments. Lenin exposed this betrayal by the leaders of the Second
    International in his works 

    <em><a href="../../1916/jan/x02.htm" onblur="t">The Collapse of the Second
    International</a></em>,

    and <em>Socialism and War</em> (see present edition, Vol. 21, pp.
    205-65, 295-338) and elsewhere.</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw29" href="#bk29" name="fw29">[29]</a> Lenin has in mind the
    revolutionary government of Finland&#8212;the Council of People&#8217;s
    Representatives&#8212;set up on January 29, 1918 after the overthrow of Svinhufvud&#8217;s
    bourgeois government. In addition to the Council of People&#8217;s Representatives there was
    also the Main Council of Workers&#8217; Organisations, which was the supreme organ of
    government. State power was based on the &#8220;seims of workers&#8217; organisations&#8217;,
    which were elected by the organised workers.</p>

    <p class="endnote">Lenin&#8217;s conclusion that the Soviets were not the only form of the
    dictatorship of the proletariat was subsequently fully confirmed. After the Second World War
    a new form of dictatorship of the proletariat arose in a number of countries of Europe and
    Asia. This was people&#8217;s democracy, which reflected the distinctive development of
    socialist revolution at a time when imperialism had been weakened and the balance of forces
    had tilted in favour of socialism&#8221; (Programme of the Communist Party of the Soviet
    Union, Moscow, 1961, p. 20).</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw30" href="#bk30" name="fw30">[30]</a> Nationalisation of the land
    in Soviet Russia was brought about by the Decree on Land of October 26 (November 8), 1917,
    which announced the expropriation of the landed estates and abolished private ownership of
    land. After the victory of the October Socialist Revolution the Soviet Government gradually
    nationalised industry and the basic means of production. By the spring of 1918 the largest
    metallurgical and machine-building works of Petrograd, Moscow and other districts, and the
    mining industry of the Urals and the Donets Basin had become public property. In May 1918,
    such important branches of industry as oil and sugar began to be nationalised. At the same
    time the Soviet Government was preparing to nationalise all large-scale industry, and a
    decree to this effect was issued on June 28, 1918.</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw31" href="#bk31" name="fw31">[31]</a> The decree on the
    nationalisation of the banks, which was based on Lenin&#8217;s draft, was endorsed by the
    All-Russia Central Executive Commitlee on December 14 (27), 1917 and published on December 15
    (28) in <em>Izvestia TsIK</em> No. 252 (see <em>Decrees of the Soviet Government</em>, Russ.
    ed., Vol. 1, 1957, pp. 225-30).</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw32" href="#bk32" name="fw32">[32]</a> The Decree on Land of
    October 26 (November 8). 1917 and the Fundamental Law on the Socialisation of the Land of
    January 18 (31), 1918 envisaged equalitarian distribution of the land (&#8220;according to a
    labour or subsistence standard&#8221;), a demand which had been put forward by the peasantry.
    This was a concession on the part of the Soviet Government to the middle peasant and it was
    aimed at consolidating the alliance of the working class and the peasantry. At the same time
    the law on the socialisation of the land proposed &#8220;the development of collective
    farming as the most profitable with regard to economising labour and produce, at the expense
    of individual farms and with the aim of going over to a socialist economy&#8221;.</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw33" href="#bk33" name="fw33">[33]</a> At the beginning of 1918
    the Bureau of International Revolutionary Propaganda of the People&#8217;s Commissariat for
    Foreign Affairs started publishing the Decree on Land in foreign languages. In February 1918
    the decree was published in Petrograd in English in the book <em>Decrees Issued by the
    Revolutionary People&#8217;s Government</em>, Vol. 1, Petrograd, February 1918.</p>
