    <h3>Speech Against Bukharin&#8217;s Amendment To The Resolution

    <h2> I </h2>
                                                      
    <p class="fst"> 
      I cannot agree at all to Comrade Bukharin&#8217;s amendment. The
      Programme characterises imperialism and the era of social
      revolution that has begun. The era of social revolution has
      begun&#8212;this has been established with absolute
      accuracy. What, however, does Comrade Bukharin want?&#8212;That
      we should give a description of socialist society in its
      developed form, i.e., communism. Here he is inaccurate. At
      present we certainly uphold the state and to say we should give
      a description of socialism in its developed form where the state
      will cease to exist&#8212;you couldn&#8217;t do anything about
      that except say that then the principle would be realised: from
      each according to his ability, to each according to his
      needs. But this is still a long way off, and to say that means
      not saying anything except that we have no firm ground to go
      on. We shall arrive there in the long run if we reach
      socialism. It is enough for us to set to work on what we have
      said. If we were to do this it would be a tremendous historic
      achievement. We cannot give a description of socialism; what
      socialism will be like when its completed forms are arrived
      at&#8212;this we do not know, we cannot tell. To say that the
      era of social revolution has begun, that we have done this or
      that, and that we want to do this or that&#8212;this we do know
      and will say, and it will show the European workers that we do
      not in any way exaggerate, so to speak, our strength; this is
      what we have begun to do and what we intend to do. But as to
      knowing at the present time what social-  ism will look like
      when completed&#8212;this we do not know. Theoretically, in
      theoretical works, in articles, speeches and lectures, we shall
      expound the view that the struggle against the anarchists is
      being waged by Kautsky incorrectly, but we cannot put this in
      the Programme because we do not yet have the data for a
      description of socialism. The bricks of which socialism will be
      composed have not yet been made. We cannot say anything further,
      and we should be as cautious and accurate as possible. In that
      and only in that will lie our Programme&#8217;s power of
      attraction. But if we advance the slightest claim to something
      that we cannot give, the power of our Programme will be
      weakened. It will be suspected that our Programme is only a
      fantasy. The Programme describes what we have begun to do and
      the succeeding steps that we wish to take. We are not in a
      position to give a description of socialism and it was incorrect
      that this task was formulated.

    <p class="fst"> 
      Since the formulation was not in writing, misunderstanding, of
      course, is possible. But Comrade Bukharin did not convince
      me. The name of our Party indicates sufficiently clearly that we
      are advancing towards complete communism, thus we are putting
      forward such abstract propositions as that each of us will work
      according to his ability and will receive according to his
      needs, without any military control and compulsion. It is
      premature to speak about this now. Just when will the state
      wither away? We shall have managed to convene more than two
      congresses before the time comes to say: see how our state is
      withering away. It is too early for that. To proclaim the
      withering away of the state prematurely would distort the
      historical perspective.

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw38" href="#bk38" name="fw38">[38]</a>
      Bukharin&#8217;s proposal, which the Congress rejected, was that
      the theoretical part of the Programme should include an
      extensive description of socialism and communism and an
      indication that the state would wither away in the very near
      future. His proposition on the withering away of the state was
      connected with his theoretically incorrect and semi-anarchistic
      attitude concerning the problem of the state which Lenin had
      pointed out as early as 1916. Criticising Bukharin&#8217;s
      mistaken thesis that the Social-Democrats should stress their
      fundamental hostility to the state in general, Lenin wrote that
      Bukharin had &#8220;absolutely wrongly&#8221; defined the
      difference between Marxists and anarchists over the question of
      the state (see present edition, Vol. 35, &#8220;To
      N. Bukharin). Lenin also criticised Bukharin&#8217;s theory of
      the state in his notes on Bukharin&#8217;s articles on the state
      and on Bukharin&#8217;s book <em>The Economics of the
      Transitional Period</em> (see V. I. Lenin, &#8220;Notes on the
      Articles by N. I. Bukharin on the State&#8221;, Russ. ed.,
      Moscow, 1933, and <em>Lenin Miscellany XI</em>,
      pp. 345-403). Posing the question of the withering away of the
      state as a short-term aim, soon after the victory of the October
      Revolution, meant, in effect, weakening the new state based on
      the dictatorship of the proletariat.
