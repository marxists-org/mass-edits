      March 8 (Evening)</h3>

    <p class="fst"> 
      Comrades, I agree with Comrade Larin that the change of title
      and the dropping of the term Labour Party, will certainly be
      made use of, but that should not worry us. If we were to reckon
      with every drawback, we should be immersed in trifles.  What we
      are doing is to return to a good old model that is known
      throughout the world. We all know the  <em><a
      href="../../../../marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm">Manifesto
      of the Communist Party</a> </em>the whole world knows it; the
      purpose of the correction is not to state that the proletariat
      is the only class which is revolutionary to the end, and that
      all other classes, including the working peasantry, can be
      revolutionary only in so far as they come over to the point of
      view of the proletariat. That is so fundamental, such a
      world-renowned thesis of the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>, that
      there cannot be any honest misunderstandings here, and as for
      dishonest ones, there is no keeping up with false
      interpretations in any case. That is why we must return now to
      the old, good, undoubtedly correct model which has played its
      part in history, spreading to all countries, to the whole world;
      I think that there are no grounds for departing from this best
      of all models.
