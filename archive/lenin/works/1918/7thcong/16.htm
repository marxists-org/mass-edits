    <h3>Speech On The Question Of Elections To The Central Committee<a
								       id="bk39" href="#fw39" name="bk39"><sup
					    class="enote">[39]</sup></a> March 8 (Evening)</h3>


    <p class="fst"> Lomov very cleverly referred to my speech in which
      I demanded that the Central Committee should be capable of
      pursuing a uniform line. This does not mean that all those in
      the Central Committee should be of one and the same opinion. To
      hold that view would be to go towards a split; therefore I
      proposed that the Congress should not accept this declaration,
      in order to enable the comrades, after consulting their local
      organisations, to think over their decision. I, too, was in the
      Central Committee in such a position at the time when a proposal
      not to sign the peace treaty was adopted, and I kept silent,
      without in any way closing my eyes to the fact that I was not
      accepting responsibility for it. Every member of the Central
      Committee is able to disclaim responsibility without ceasing to
      be a member and without raising an uproar. Of course, comrades,
      in certain circumstances it is permissible, sometimes it is
      inevitable, but that this should be necessary now with the
      present organisation of Soviet power, which enables us to check
      how far we are keeping contact with the masses&#8212;this I
      doubt. I think that if the question of Vinnichenko arises, the
      comrades can defend their point of view without resigning from
      the Central Committee. If we are going to uphold the standpoint
      of preparing for a revolutionary war and of manoeuvring, it is
      necessary to enter the Central Committee; one can state that
      disagreements have arisen from below, we have an absolute right
      to make a statement about that. There is not the slightest
      danger that history will impose responsibility on Uritsky and
      Lomov for not rejecting the title of members of the Central
      Committee. We must try to find some kind of restraint that will
      do away with the fashion for resigning from the Central
      Committee. It should be stated that the Congress expresses the
      hope that comrades will formulate their disagreement through
      their protests but not by resigning from the Central Committee,
      and that the Congress, taking its statement into account, will
      vote against removal of the candidatures of the group of
      comrades and will hold the elections, calling on them to take
      back their declarations.

    <h3>Endnotes</h3>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw39" href="#bk39" name="fw39">[39]</a>
      When the new Central Committee was elected the &#8220;Left
      Communists&#8221; refused to serve on it. On behalf of a group of
      &#8220;Left Communists&#8221; M. S. Uritsky stated at the Congress
      that they would not serve on the Central Committee because they
      did not wish to take responsibility for the policy it was
      conducting. The &#8220;Left Communists&#8221; even refused to vote
      during the election of the Central Committee. The Congress voted
      its condemnation of this disruptive step and passed a decision
      that the Party organisations that had delegated the &#8220;Left
      Communists&#8221; were to be informed of their conduct. When it
      met this resistance from the Congress, the group took part in the
      voting and the Congress rescinded its decision.
