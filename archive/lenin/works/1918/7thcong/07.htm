    <h2>V. I. Lenin</h2>
    <h3>Extraordinary Seventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) </h3>

    <h2> MARCH 6-8, 1918 </h2>
    <h3>Section Seven</h3>
    <hr  />

    <h2>7</h2>

    <h3>Speech Against Zinoviev&#8217;s Amendment To The Addendum To The Resolution On War And
    Peace<br />
     March 8</h3>

    <p>I think, comrades, that there is no need for this amendment which Comrade Zinoviev has
    moved.<a id="bk23" href="#fw23" name="bk23"><sup class="enote">[23]</sup></a> I hope that
    only members of the Party are in the hall; in view of the state importance of the question, I
    think that we can adopt a decision to take the personal signature of everyone present in this
    hall.</p>

    <p>This is by no means a superfluous measure; we are in conditions in which military secrets
    become very important questions, the most essential questions, for the Russian Republic. If
    we say in the press that the Congress has decided on ratification there cannot be any
    misunderstanding. I only propose that this should not be voted on just now because there may
    be changes: further information should reach us today. We have taken special measures to
    obtain information from the North-East and the South&#8212;this news may cause some change.
    Since the Congress agrees that we must manoeuvre in the interests of a revolutionary
    war&#8212;will even empower the Central Committee to declare war&#8212;it is obvious that we
    have the agreement of both sections of the Party on this; the dispute was only over whether
    or not to continue the war without any respite. I consider that in moving this amendment I am
    saying something indisputable for the majority and for the opposition; I think that there
    cannot be any other interpretations. I consider it more practical merely to confirm that it
    must be kept secret. And in addition, to adopt supplementary measures and on this account to
    take the personal signature of each person present in the hall.</p>

    <h3>Endnotes</h3>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw23" href="#bk23" name="fw23">[23]</a> G. Y. Zinoviev proposed
      instructing the new Central Committee to find a form for the publication of the resolution on
      war and peace. Zinoviev&#8217;s amendment was not accepted; by a majority vote the Congress
      affirmed Lenin&#8217;s proposed addition to the resolution.</p>
