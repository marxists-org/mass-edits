    <h2>V. I. Lenin</h2>
    <h3>Extraordinary Seventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) </h3>

    <h2> MARCH 6-8, 1918 </h2>
    <h3>Section Twelve</h3>
    <hr  />

    <h2>12</h2>

    <h3>Speech on Mgeladze&#8217;s Proposal for Drawing the Chief
    Party Organisations Into the Work of Drafting the Party
    Programme<br />

      March 8 (Evening)</h3>

    <p class="fst"> 
      Under the conditions in which Russia is at present&#8212;in a
      state of civil war, of being cut up into parts&#8212;this is
      impermissible. It goes without saying that if it is at all
      possible the commission which will make corrections will print
      them immediately, and on each occasion the local organisations
      will be able to express their opinion and must do so, but
      formally to bind ourselves to do something that cannot be
      carried out in the near future will entail still greater delay
      than a congress.
