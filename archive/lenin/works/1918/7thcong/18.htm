    <h2>V. I. Lenin</h2>
    <h3>Extraordinary Seventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) </h3>

    <h2> MARCH 6-8, 1918 </h2>
    <h3>Section Eighteen</h3>
    <hr  />

    <h2> 18 </h2>

    <h3>Rough Outline Of The Draft Programme</h3>


    <p class="fst"> 
      My draft to be taken as the basis<a id="bk40" href="#fw40"
      name="bk40"><sup class="enote">[40]</sup></a> (pamphlet, p.19
      <em>et seq.</em>). 


    </p><p> 
      The theoretical part to remain, after discarding the last
      paragraph of the first part (p. 22 of the pamphlet, from the
      words &#8220;The urgent task of the day&#8221; to the words
      &#8220;the substance of the socialist revolution&#8221;,<a
      id="bk41" href="#fw41" name="bk41"><sup
      class="enote">[41]</sup></a>i.e., 5 lines). 

 
    </p><p> 
      In the next paragraph (p. 22), beginning with the words
      &#8220;The fulfilment of this task&#8221;, insert the alteration
      indicated in the article &#8220;Concerning a Revision of the
      Party Programme&#8221; in <em>Prosveshcheniye</em> (No. 1-2,
      September-October 1917), p.93.*** 

    </p><p>  
      In the same paragraph in two places insert instead of &#8220;social-chauvinism": 
      
    </p><p> 
      (1) &#8220;<em>opportunism</em> and social-chauvinism"; 

    </p><p> 
      (2) &#8220;between <em>opportunism</em> and social-chauvinism,
      on the one hand, and the revolutionary internationalist struggle
      of the proletariat for the realisation of the socialist system
      on the other.&#8221;

    </p><p> 
      Further on, everything has to be re-written, approximately as follows: 
  
    </p><p> 
      The Revolution of October 25 (November 7), 1917 in Russia
      brought about the dictatorship of the proletariat, which has
      been supported by the poor peasants or semi-proletarians. 

    </p><p> 
      This dictatorship confronts the Communist Party in Russia with
      the task of carrying through to the end, of completing, the
      expropriation of the landowners and bourgeoisie that has already
      begun, and the transfer of all factories, railways, banks, the
      fleet and other means of production and exchange to ownership by
      the Soviet Republic; 

    </p><p> 
      utilisation of the alliance of urban workers and poor peasants,
      which has already abolished private ownership of land, and
      utilisation of the law on the transitional form between
      small-peasant farming and socialism, which modern ideologists of
      the peasantry that has put itself on the side of the
      proletarians have called socialisation of the land, for a
      gradual but steady transition to joint tillage and large-scale
      socialist agriculture; 

    </p><p> 
      consolidation and further development of the Federative Republic
      of Soviets as an immeasurably higher and more progressive form
      of democracy than bourgeois parliamentarism, and as the sole
      type of state corresponding, on the basis of the experience of
      the Paris Commune of 1871 and equally of the experience of the
      Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917-18, to the transitional
      period between capitalism and socialism, i.e., to the period of
      the dictatorship of the proletariat; 

    </p><p> 
      thorough utilisation in every way of the torch of world
      socialist revolution lit in Russia in order, by paralysing the
      attempts of the imperialist bourgeois states to intervene in the
      internal affairs of Russia or to unite for direct struggle and
      war against the socialist Soviet Republic, to carry the
      revolution into the most advanced countries and in general into
      all countries. 
    </p>

    <h3> Ten Theses On Soviet Power</h3>

    <h2>Consolidation and Development of Soviet Power</h2>

    <p class="fst"> 
      The consolidation and development of Soviet power as the form of
      the dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry
      (semi-proletarians), a form already tested by experience and
      brought to the fore by the mass movement and the revolutionary
      struggle. 

    </p><p> 
      The consolidation and development must consist in the
      accomplishment (a broader, more general and planned
      accomplishment) of those tasks which historically devolve on
      this form of state power, on this new type of state, namely: 

    </p><p class="quote"> 
      (1) union and organisation of the working and exploited masses
      oppressed by capitalism, and only them, i.e., only the workers
      and poor peasantry, semi-proletarians, with automatic exclusion
      of the exploiting classes and rich representatives of the petty
      bourgeoisie; 

    </p><p class="quote"> 
      (2) union of the most vigorous, active, class-conscious part of
      the oppressed classes, their vanguard, which must educate every
      member of the working population for independent participation
      in the management of the state, not theoretically but
      practically; 

    </p><p class="quote"> 
      (4) (3) abolition of parliamentarism (as the separation of
      legislative from executive activity); union of legislative and
      executive state activity. Fusion of administration with
      legislation; 

    </p><p class="quote"> 
      (3) (4) closer connection of the whole apparatus of state power
      and state administration with the masses than under previous
      forms of democracy; 

    </p><p class="quote"> 
      (5) creation of an armed force of workers and peasants, one
      least divorced from the people (Soviets = armed workers and
      peasants). Organised character of nation-wide arming of the
      people, as one of the first steps towards arming the whole
      people; 

    </p><p class="quote"> 
      (6) more complete democracy, through less formality and making
      election and recall easier; 

    </p><p class="quote"> 
      (7) close (and direct) connection with occupations and with
      productive-economic units (elections based on factories, and on
      local peasant and handicraft areas). This close connection makes
      it possible to carry out profound socialist changes; 

    </p><p class="quote">  
      (8) (partly, if not wholly, covered by the preceding)&#8212;the
      possibility of getting rid of bureaucracy, of doing without it,
      the beginning of the realisation of this possibility 

    </p><p class="quote"> 
      (9) transfer of the focus of attention in questions of democracy
      from formal recognition of a formal equality of the bourgeoisie
      and the proletariat, of poor and rich, to the prac-  tical
      feasibility of the enjoyment of freedom (democracy) by the
      working and exploited mass of the population; 

    </p><p class="quote"> 
      (10) the further development of the Soviet organisation of the
      state must consist in every member of a Soviet being obliged to
      carry out constant work in administering the state, alongside
      participation in meetings of the Soviet;&#8212;and furthermore
      in each and every member of the population being drawn gradually
      both into taking part in Soviet organisation (on the condition
      of subordination to organisations of the working people) and
      into serving in state administration.
    </p>

    <h3> The Fulfilment of These Tasks Requires:</h3>

    <p> 
      a) in the political sphere: development of the Soviet Republic. 

    </p><p> 
      Advantages of Soviets  (<em>Prosveshcheniye</em>, pp. 13-14); (six items); 

    </p><p> 
      extension of the Soviet Constitution <em>in so far as</em> the
      resistance of the exploiters ceases to the <em>whole</em>
      population; 

    </p><p> 
      federation of nations, as a transition to a <em>conscious</em>
      and closer unity of the working people, when they have learnt
      <em>voluntarily</em> to rise above national dissension; 

    </p><p> 
      necessarily ruthless suppression of the resistance of the
      exploiters; standards of &#8220;general&#8221; (<em>i.e.</em>,
      bourgeois) democracy are subordinate to this aim, give way to
      it: 

    </p><p> 
      &#8220;Liberties&#8221; and democracy <em>not</em> for all, but
      <em>for</em> the working and exploited masses, to emancipate
      them from exploitation; ruthless suppression of exploiters; 

    </p><p> 
      NB: chief stress is shifted <em>from</em> formal
      <em>recognition</em> of liberties (such as existed under
      bourgeois parliamentarism) <em>to</em> actually ensuring the
      <em>enjoyment</em> of liberties by the working people who are
      overthrowing the exploiters, e.g., from <em>recognition</em> of
      freedom of assembly to the <em>handing over</em> of all the best
      halls and premises to the workers, from recognition of freedom
      of speech to the handing over of all the best printing presses
      to the workers, and so forth. 

    </p><p> 
      A brief enumeration of these &#8220;liberties&#8221; from the old minimum programme. 

    </p><p> 
      [Arming the workers and disarming the bourgeoisie.] 

    </p><p> 
      Transition <em>through</em> the Soviet state to the gradual
      abolition of the state by systematically drawing an ever greater
      number of citizens, and subsequently <em>each and every</em>
      citizen, into direct and <em>daily</em> performance of their
      share of the burdens of administering the state. 

    </p><p> 
      b) In the economic sphere: 

    </p><p> 
      Socialist organisation of production on the scale of the whole
      state: management by <em>workers&#8217; organisations</em>
      (trade unions, factory committees, etc.) under the general
      leadership of Soviet power, which alone is <em>sovereign.</em> 

    </p><p> 
      The same for transport and distribution (at first state monopoly
      of &#8220;trade&#8221;, subsequently replacement, complete and
      final, of &#8220;trade&#8221; by planned, organised
      <em>distribution</em> through associations of trading and
      industrial office workers, under the leadership of Soviet
      power). 

    </p><p> 
      &#8212;Compulsory organisation of the <em>whole</em> population
      in consumer and producer communes. 

    </p><p> 
      While not (for the time being) abolishing money and not
      prohibiting individual purchase and sale transactions by
      individual families, we must, in the first place, make it
      obligatory by law to carry out all such transactions through the
      consumer and producer communes. 

    </p><p> 
      &#8212;An immediate start to be made on full realisation of
      universal compulsory labour service, with the most cautious and
      gradual extension of it to the small peasants who live by their
      own farming without wage labour; 

    </p><p> 
      the first measure, the first step towards universal compulsory
      labour service must be the introduction of consumers&#8217; work
      (budget) books (compulsory introduction) for all well-to-do ( =
      persons with an income over 500 rubles per month, and then for
      owners of enterprises with wage-workers, for families with
      servants, etc.). 

    </p><p> 
      Buying and selling is also permissible not through one&#8217;s
      commune (during journeys, at markets, etc.), but with compulsory
      entry of the transaction (if above a definite sum) in the
      consumers&#8217; work book. 

    </p><p> 
      &#8212;Complete concentration of banking in the hands of the
      state and of all financial operations of trade in the banks.
      Standardisation of banking current accounts; gradual transition
      to the compulsory keeping of current accounts in the bank, at
      first by the largest, and later by <em>all</em> the
      country&#8217;s enterprises. Compulsory deposit of money in the
      banks and transfer of money <em>only</em> through the banks. 

    </p><p> 
      &#8212;Standardisation of accounting and control over all
      production and distribution of output; this accounting and
      control must be carried out at first by workers&#8217;
      organisations and subsequently by <em>each and every</em> member
      of the population. 

    </p><p> 
      &#8212;Organisation of competition between the various (all)
      consumer and producer communes of the country for steady
      improvement of organisation, discipline and labour productivity,
      for transition to superior techniques, for economising labour
      and materials, for gradually reducing the working day to six
      hours, and for gradually equalising <em>all</em> wages and
      salaries in <em>all</em> occupations and categories. 

    </p><p> 
      &#8212;Steady, systematic measures for (transition to
      <em>Massenspeisung</em> <span class="inote">[A form of Public
      catering]</span> replacement of the individual domestic economy
      of separate families by joint catering for large groups of
      families.  

    </p><p> 
      <em>In the educational sphere</em> 

    </p><p> 
      the old items, plus. 

    </p><p> 
      <em>In the financial sphere</em> 

    </p><p> 
      replacement of indirect taxes by a progressive income and
      property tax, and equally by deduction of a (definite) revenue
      from state monopolies. In this connection, remittance in kind of
      bread and other products to workers employed by the state in
      various forms of socially necessary labour. 
    </p>

    <h3>INTERNATIONAL POLICY</h3>

    <p> 
      Support of the revolutionary movement of the socialist
      proletariat in the advanced countries in the first instance. 

    </p><p> 
      Propaganda. Agitation. Fraternisation. 

    </p><p> 
      Ruthless struggle against opportunism and social-chauvinism. 

    </p><p> 
      Support of the democratic and revolutionary movement in all
      countries in general, and especially in the colonies and
      dependent countries. 

    </p><p> 
      Liberation of the colonies. Federation as a transition to voluntary fusion.

      The Congress voted in favour of Lenin&#8217;s resolution
      condemning the &#8220;Left Communists&#8217;&#8221; refusal to
      serve on the Central Committee. In the belief that they would
      submit to Party discipline, the Congress elected their
      representatives (N. I. Bukharin, A. Lomov and M. S. Uritsky) to
      the Central Committee. All three, however, demonstratively
      stated before the Congress that they refused to serve on the
      Central Committee. The refusal was not accepted and the Congress
      decided without a debate to postpone the question of providing
      deputies in place of the elected &#8220;Left Communists&#8221;
      until the Central Committee met. 

    </p>
    <p class="endnote">
      After the Party Congress and the Extraordinary Fourth All-Russia
      Congress of Soviets, which ratified the peace treaty with
      Germany, the &#8220;Left Communists&#8221;, in spite of the
      Central Committee&#8217;s insistent demands, refused to begin
      work for several months. For Lenin&#8217;s appraisal of the
      disruptive activities of the &#8220;Left Communists&#8221; after
