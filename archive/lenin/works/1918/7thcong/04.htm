    <h3>Speeches Against Trotsky&#8217;s Amendments to the Resolution on War and Peace<br />
      March 8 (Morning)</h3>

    <h3>I</h3>

    <p class="fst">Comrades, in my speech I have already said that neither I nor those who
      support me consider it possible to accept this amendment. We must in no way bind our hands in
      any strategic manoeuvre. Everything depends on the relationship of forces and the time of the
      attack against us by these or those imperialist countries, the time when the rehabilitation
      of our army, which is undoubtedly beginning reaches the point when we shall be in a position
      and obliged not merely to refrain from concluding peace but to declare war. Instead of the
      amendments which Comrade Trotsky proposes, I am ready to accept the following:</p>

    <p>First, to say&#8212;and this I shall certainly uphold&#8212;that the present resolution is
      not to be published in the press but that a communication should be made only about the
      ratification of the treaty.</p>

    <p>Secondly, in the forms of publication and content the Central Committee shall have the
      right to introduce changes in connection with a possible offensive by the Japanese.</p>

    <p>Thirdly, to say that the Congress will empower the C.C of the Party both to break all the
      peace treaties and to declare war on any imperialist power or the whole world when the C.C.
      of the Party considers that the appropriate moment for this has come.</p>
    
    <p>We must give the C.C. full power to break the treaties at any moment but this does not in
      any way imply that we shall break them just now, in the situation that exists today. At the
      present time we must not bind our hands in any way. The words that Comrade Trotsky proposes
      to introduce will gain the votes of those who are against ratification in general, votes for
      a middle course which will create afresh a situation in which not a single worker, not a
      single soldier, will understand anything in our resolution.</p>

    <p>At the present time we shall endorse the necessity of ratifying the treaty and we shall
      empower the Central Committee to declare war at any moment, because an attack against us is
      being prepared, perhaps from three sides; Britain or France wants to take Archangel from
      us&#8212;it is quite possible they will, but in any case we ought not to hamper our central
      institution in any way, whether in regard to breaking the peace treaty or in regard to
      declaring war. We are giving financial aid to the Ukrainians, we are helping them in so far
      as we can. In any case we must not bind ourselves to not signing any peace treaty. In an
      epoch of growing wars, coming one after the other, new combinations grow up. The peace treaty
      is entirely a matter of vital manoeuvring&#8212;either we stand by this condition of
      manoeuvring or we formally bind our hands in advance in such a way that it will be impossible
      to move; neither making peace nor waging war will be possible.</p>

    <h3>II</h3>

    <p>It seems to me that I have said: no, I cannot accept this. This amendment makes a hint, it
      expresses what Comrade Trotsky wants to say. There should be no hints in the resolution.</p>

    <p>The first point says that we accept ratification of the treaty, considering it essential
      to utilise every, even the smallest, possibility of a breathing-space before imperialism
      attacks the Soviet Socialist Republic. In speaking of a breathing space, we do not forget
      that an attack on our Republic is still going on. There you have my opinion, which I stressed
      in my reply to the debate.</p>
