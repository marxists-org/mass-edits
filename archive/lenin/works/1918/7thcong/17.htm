    <h2>V. I. Lenin</h2>
    <h3>Extraordinary Seventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) </h3>

    <h2> MARCH 6-8, 1918 </h2>
    <h3>Section Seventeen</h3>
    <hr  />

    <h2> 17 </h2>

    <h3> Resolution On The Refusal Of The &#8220;Left
      Communists&#8221; To Be Members Of The Central Committee</h3>


    <p class="fst"> 
      The Congress is of the opinion that a refusal to enter the
      Central Committee in the situation at present obtaining in the
      Party is particularly undesirable, since such a refusal is in
      general impermissible in principle to those who desire the unity
      of the Party, and would today be a double threat to unity. 
      
    </p><p> 
      The Congress declares that everyone can and should deny his
      responsibility for any step taken by the Central Committee, if
      he does not agree with it, by means of a declaration to that
      effect but not by leaving the Central Committee. 

    </p><p> 
      The Congress is firm in the hope that the comrades will, after a
      consultation with the mass organisations, withdraw their
      resignation; the Congress will, therefore, carry through
      elections without taking the statement of resignation into
      consideration.
