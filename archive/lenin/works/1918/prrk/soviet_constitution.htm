    <h1>The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky </h1>

    <hr />


    <h3>The Soviet Constitution</h3>

    <p class="fst">As I have already pointed out, the disfranchisement
    of the bourgeoisie is not a necessary and indispensable feature of
    the dictatorship of the proletariat. And in Russia, the
    Bolsheviks, who long before October put forward the slogan of
    proletarian dictatorship, did not say anything in advance about
    disfranchising the exploiters. <em>This</em> aspect of the
    dictatorship did not make its appearance &#8220;according to the
    plan&#8221; of any particular party; it <em>emerged</em> of itself
    in the course of the struggle. Of course, Kautsky the historian
    failed to notice this. He failed to understand that even when the
    Mensheviks (who compromised with the bourgeoisie) still ruled the
    Soviets, the bourgeoisie cut themselves off from the Soviets of
    their own accord, boycotted them, put themselves up in opposition
    to them and intrigued against them. The Soviets arose without any
    constitution and existed without one for <em>more than a year</em>
    (from the spring of 1917 to the summer of 1918). The fury of the
    bourgeoisie against this independent and omnipotent (because it
    was all-embracing) organisation of the oppressed; the fight,
    the unscrupulous, self-seeking and sordid fight, the
    bourgeoisie waged against the Soviets; and, lastly, the overt
    participation of the bourgeoisie (from the Cadets to the Right
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, from Milyukov to Kerensky) in the
    Kornilov mutiny<a id="bk23" href="#fw23" name="bk23"><sup
    class="enote">[23]</sup></a>&#8212;all this <em>paved the way</em>
    for the formal exclusion of the bourgeoisie from the Soviets.</p>

    <p>Kautsky has heard about the Kornilov mutiny, but he
      majestically scorns historical facts and the course and forms of
      the struggle which determine the <em>forms</em> of the
      dictatorship. Indeed, who should care about facts where
      &#8220;pure&#8221; democracy is involved? That is why
      Kautsky&#8217;s &#8220;criticism&#8221; of the disfranchisement
      of the bourgeoisie is distinguished by such . . . sweet
      na&#239;vet&#233;, which would be touching in a child but is
      repulsive in a person who has not yet been officially certified
      as feeble-minded.</p>

    <p>&#8220;. . . If the capitalists found themselves in an
    insignificant minority under universal suffrage they would more
    readily become reconciled to their fate&#8221;
    (p. 33). . . . Charming, isn&#8217;t it? Clever Kautsky has seen many
    cases in history, and, generally, knows perfectly well from his
    own observations of life of landowners and capitalists reckoning
    with the will of the majority of the oppressed. Clever Kautsky
    firmly advocates an &#8220;opposition&#8221;, i.e., parliamentary
    struggle. That is literally what he says: &#8220;opposition&#8221;
    (p. 34 and elsewhere).</p>

    <p>My dear learned historian and politician! It would not harm you
    to know that &#8220;opposition&#8221; is a concept that belongs to
    the peaceful and only to the parliamentary struggle, i.e., a
    concept that corresponds to a non-revolutionary situation, a
    concept that corresponds to an <em>absence of revolution</em>.
    During revolution we have to deal with a ruthless enemy in civil
    war; and no reactionary jeremiads of a petty bourgeois who fears
    such a war, as Kautsky does, will alter the fact. To examine the
    problems of ruthless civil war from the point of view of
    &#8220;opposition&#8221; at a time when the bourgeoisie are
    prepared to commit any crime&#8212;the example of the Versailles
    men and their deals with Bismarck must mean something to every
    person who does not treat history like Gogol&#8217;s Petrushka<a
    id="bk24" href="#fw24" name="bk24"><sup
    class="enote">[24]</sup></a>&#8212;when the bourgeoisie are
    summoning foreign states to their aid and intriguing with them
    against the revolution, is simply comical. The revolutionary
    proletariat is to put on a nightcap, like
    &#8220;Muddle-headed Counsellor&#8221; Kautsky, and regard
    the bourgeoisie, who are organising Dutov, Krasnov and Czech
    counter-revolutionary insurrections and are paying millions
    to saboteurs, as a legal &#8220;opposition&#8221;. Oh, what
    profundity!</p>

    <p>Kautsky is exclusively interested in the formal, legal aspect
    of the question, and, reading his disquisitions on the Soviet
    Constitution, one involuntarily recalls Bebel&#8217;s words:
    Lawyers are thoroughbred reactionaries. &#8220;In reality,&#8221;
    Kautsky writes, &#8220;the capitalists alone cannot be
    disfranchised. What is a capitalist in the legal sense of the
    term? A property-owner? Even in a country which has advanced
    so far along the path of economic progress as Germany, where the
    proletariat is so numerous, the establishment of a Soviet republic
    would disfranchise a large mass of people. In 1907, the number of
    persons in the German Empire engaged in the three great
    occupational groups&#8212;agriculture, industry and
    commerce&#8212;together with their families amounted roughly to
    thirty-five million in the wage-earners&#8217; and
    salaried employees&#8217; group, and seventeen million in the
    independent group. Hence, a party might well form a majority among
    the wage-workers but a minority among the population as a
    whole&#8221; (p. 33).</p>

    <p>That is an example of Kautsky&#8217;s mode of
    argument. Isn&#8217;t it the counter-revolutionary whining
    of a bourgeois? Why, Mr. Kautsky, have you relegated all the
    &#8220;independents&#8221; to the category of the disfranchised,
    when you know very well that the overwhelming majority of the
    Russian peasants do not employ hired labour, and do not,
    therefore, lose their franchise? Isn&#8217;t this
    falsification?</p>

    <p>Why, learned economist, did you not quote the facts with which
    you are perfectly familiar and which are to be found in those same
    German statistical returns for 1907 relating to hired labour in
    agriculture according to size of farms? Why did you not quote
    these facts to enable the German workers, the readers of your
    pamphlet, to see <em>how many exploiters there are</em>, and how
    few they are compared with the total number of
    &#8220;farmers&#8221; who figure in German statistics?</p>

    <p>You did not because your apostasy has made you a mere sycophant
    of the bourgeoisie.</p>

    <p>The term capitalist, Kautsky argues, is legally a vague
    concept, and on several pages he thunders against the
    &#8220;arbitrariness&#8221; of the Soviet Constitution. This
    &#8220;serious scholar&#8221; has no objection to the British
    bourgeoisie taking several centuries to work out and develop a new
    (new for the Middle Ages) bourgeois constitution, but,
    representative of lackey&#8217;s science that he is, he will
    allow no time to us, the workers and peasants of Russia. He
    expects us to have a constitution all worked out to the very last
    letter in a few months.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Arbitrariness!&#8221; Just imagine what a depth of vile
    subservience to the bourgeoisie and most inept pedantry is
    contained in <em>such</em> a reproach. When thoroughly bourgeois
    and for the most part reactionary lawyers in the capitalist
    countries have for centuries or decades been drawing up most
    detailed rules and regulations and writing scores and hundreds of
    volumes of laws and interpretations of laws to oppress the
    workers, to bind the <em>poor man</em> hand and foot and to place
    thousands of hindrances and obstacles in the way of any of the
    common labouring people&#8212;there the bourgeois liberals and Mr.
    Kautsky see no &#8220;arbitrariness&#8221;! That is
    &#8220;law&#8221; and &#8220;order&#8221;! The ways in which the
    poor are to be &#8220;kept down&#8221; have all been thought out
    and written down. There are thousands of bourgeois lawyers and
    bureaucrats (about them Kautsky says nothing at all, probably just
    because Marx attached enormous significance to <em>smashing</em>
    the bureaucratic machine . . . )&#8212;lawyers and bureaucrats who
    know how to interpret the laws in such a way that the worker and
    the average peasant can never break through the barbed-wire
    entanglements of these laws. This is not
    &#8220;arbitrariness&#8221; on the part of the bourgeoisie, it is
    not the dictatorship of the sordid and self-seeking
    exploiters who are sucking the blood of the people. Nothing of the
    kind! It is &#8220;pure democracy&#8221;, which is becoming purer
    and purer every day.</p>

    <p>But now that the toiling and exploited classes, while cut off
    by the imperialist war from their brothers across the border, have
    for the first time in history set up their <em>own</em> Soviets,
    have called to the work of political construction <em>those
    people</em> whom the bourgeoisie used to oppress, grind down and
    stupefy, and have begun <em>themselves</em> to build a
    <em>new,</em> proletarian state, have begun in the heat of furious
    struggle, in the fire of civil war, to <em>sketch</em> the
    fundamental principles of a state <em>without
    exploiters</em>&#8212;all the bourgeois scoundrels, the whole
    gang of bloodsuckers, with Kautsky echoing them, howl about
    &#8220;arbitrariness&#8221;! Indeed, how will these ignorant
    people, these workers and peasants, this &#8220;mob&#8221;, be
    able to interpret their laws? How can these common labourers
    acquire a sense of justice without the counsel of educated
    lawyers, of bourgeois writers, of the Kautskys and the wise old
    bureaucrats? 

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kautsky quotes from my speech of April 28, 1918,
      the words: &#8220;The people themselves determine the procedure
      and the time of elections.&#8221; And Kautsky, the &#8220;pure
      democrat&#8221;, infers from this:</p>
    
    <p>&#8221;. . . Hence, it would mean that every assembly of electors
      may determine the procedure of elections at their own
      discretion. Arbitrariness and the opportunity of getting rid of
      undesirable opposition in the ranks of the proletariat itself
      would thus be carried to the extreme&#8221; (p. 37).</p>
    
    <p>Well, how does this differ from the talk of a hack hired by
    capitalists, who howls about the people oppressing industrious
    workers who are &#8220;willing to work&#8221; during a strike? Why
    is the <em>bourgeois</em> bureaucratic method of determining
    electoral procedure under &#8220;pure&#8221; bourgeois democracy
    <em>not</em> arbitrariness? Why should the sense of justice <em>among the
    masses who have risen to fight</em> their age-old exploiters
    and who are being educated and steeled in this desperate struggle
    be less than that of a <em>handful</em> of bureaucrats,
    intellectuals and lawyers brought up in <em>bourgeois</em>
    prejudices?</p>

    <p>Kautsky is a true socialist. Don&#8217;t dare suspect the
    sincerity of this very respectable father of a family, of this
    very honest citizen. He is an ardent and convinced supporter of
    the victory of the workers, of the proletarian revolution. All he
    wants is that the honey-mouthed, petty-bourgeois
    intellectuals and philistines in nightcaps should
    <em>first&#8212;before</em> the masses begin to move, <em>before</em>
    they start a furious battle with the exploiters, and certainly
    <em>without</em> civil war&#8212;draw up a moderate and precise <em>set of
    rules for the development of the revolution</em>. . . .</p>

    <p>Burning with profound moral indignation, our most learned Judas
      Golovlyov<a id="bk25" href="#fw25" name="bk25"><sup
							  class="enote">[25]</sup></a> tells 
      the German workers that on June
      14, 1918, the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of
      Soviets resolved to expel the representatives of the Right
      Socialist-Revolutionary Party and the Mensheviks from the
      Soviets. &#8220;This measure,&#8221; writes Judas Kautsky, all
      afire with noble indignation, &#8220;is not directed against
      definite persons guilty of definite punishable offences. . . . 
      
      The Constitution of the Soviet Republic does not contain a
    single word about the immunity of Soviet deputies. It is not
    definite <em>persons</em>, but definite <em>parties</em> that are
    expelled from the Soviets&#8221; (p. 37).</p>

    <p>Yes, that is really awful, an intolerable departure from pure
    democracy, according to the rules of which our revolutionary Judas
    Kautsky will make the revolution. We Russian Bolsheviks should
    first have guaranteed immunity to the Savinkovs and Co., to the
    Lieberdans,<a id="bk26" href="#fw26" name="bk26"><sup
    class="enote">[26]</sup></a> Potresovs (&#8220;activists&#8221;<a
    id="bk27" href="#fw27" name="bk27"><sup
    class="enote">[27]</sup></a>) and Co., then drawn up a criminal
    code proclaiming participation in the Czech
    counter-revolutionary war, or in the alliance with the
    German imperialists in the Ukraine or in Georgia <em>against</em>
    the workers of one&#8217;s own country, to be &#8220;punishable
    offences&#8221;, and <em>only then</em>, on the basis of this
    criminal code, would we be entitled, in accordance with the
    principles of &#8220;pure democracy&#8221;, to expel
    &#8220;definite persons&#8221; from the Soviets. It goes without
    saying that the Czechs, who are subsidised by the British and
    French capitalists through the medium (or thanks to the agitation)
    of the Savinkovs, Potresovs and Lieberdans, and the Krasnovs who
    receive ammunition from the Germans through the medium of the
    Ukrainian and Tiflis Mensheviks, would have sat quietly waiting
    until we were ready with our proper criminal code, and, like the
    purest democrats they are, would have confined themselves to the
    role of an &#8220;opposition&#8221;. . . .</p>

    <p>No less profound moral indignation is aroused in
    Kautsky&#8217;s breast by the fact that the Soviet Constitution
    disfranchises all those who &#8220;employ hired labour with a view
    to profit&#8221;. &#8220;A home-worker, or a small master
    employing only one journeyman,&#8221; Kautsky writes, &#8220;may
    live and feel quite like a proletarian, but he has no vote&#8221;
    (p. 36).</p>

    <p>What a departure from &#8220;pure democracy&#8221;! What an
    injustice! True, up to now all Marxists have thought&#8212;and
    thousands of facts have proved it&#8212;that the small masters
    were the most unscrupulous and grasping exploiters of hired
    labour, but our Judas Kautsky takes the small masters not as a
    <em>class</em> (who invented that pernicious theory of the class
    struggle?) but as single individuals, exploiters who &#8220;live
    and feel quite like proletarians&#8221;. The famous &#8220;thrifty
    Agnes&#8221;, who was considered dead and buried long ago, has
    come to life again under Kautsky&#8217;s pen. This &#8220;thrifty
    Agnes&#8221; was invented and launched into German literature some
    decades ago by that &#8220;pure&#8221; democrat, the bourgeois
    Eugen Richter. He predicted untold calamities that would follow
    the dictatorship of the proletariat, the confiscation of the
    capital of the exploiters, and asked with an innocent air: What is
    a capitalist in the legal sense of the term? He took as an example
    a poor, thrifty seamstress (&#8220;thrifty Agnes&#8221;), whom the
    wicked &#8220;proletarian dictators&#8221; rob of her last
    farthing. There was a time when all German Social-Democrats
    used to poke fun at this &#8220;thrifty Agnes&#8221; of the pure
    democrat, Eugen Richter. But that was a long, long time ago, when
    Bebel, who was quite frank and open about there being many
    national-liberals<a id="bk28" href="#fw28" name="bk28"><sup
    class="enote">[28]</sup></a> in his party, was still alive; that
    was very long ago, when Kautsky was not yet a renegade.</p>

    <p>Now &#8220;thrifty Agnes&#8221; has come to life again in the
    person of the &#8220;small master who employs only one journeyman
    and who lives and feels quite like a proletarian&#8221;. The
    wicked Bolsheviks are wronging him, depriving him of his vote. It
    is true that &#8220;every assembly of electors&#8221; in the
    Soviet Republic, as Kautsky tells us, may admit into its midst a
    poor little master who, for instance, may be connected with this
    or that factory, if, by way of an exception, he is not an
    exploiter, and if he <em>really</em> &#8220;lives and feels quite
    like a proletarian&#8221;. But can one rely on the knowledge of
    life, on the sense of justice of an irregular factory meeting of
    common workers acting (how awful!) without a written code? Would
    it not clearly be better to grant the vote to <em>all</em>
    exploiters, to <em>all</em> who employ hired labour, rather than
    risk the possibility of &#8220;thrifty Agnes&#8221; and the
    &#8220;small master who lives and feels quite like a
    proletarian&#8221; being wronged by the workers?</p>

    <center>* &#160; &#160; *</center>
    <center>*</center>

    <p>Let the contemptible renegade scoundrels, amidst the applause
    of the bourgeoisie and the social-chauvinists,<a id="bk29"
    href="#fw29" name="bk29"><sup class="enote">[29]</sup></a> abuse
    our Soviet Constitution for disfranchising the exploiters!
    That&#8217;s fine because it will accelerate and widen the split
    between the revolutionary workers of Europe and the Scheidemanns
    and Kautskys, the Renaudels and Longuets, the Hendersons and
    Ramsay MacDonalds, the old leaders and old betrayers of
    socialism.</p>

    <p>The mass of the oppressed classes, the class-conscious
    and honest revolutionary proletarian leaders will be <em>on our
    side.</em> It will be enough to acquaint such proletarians and
    such people with our Soviet Constitution for them to say at once:
    &#8220;These are really <em>our people</em>, this is a real
    workers&#8217; party, this is a real workers&#8217; government,
    for it does not deceive the workers by talking about reforms in
    the way <em>all the above-mentioned leaders have done</em>,
    but is fighting the exploiters in real earnest, making a
    revolution in real earnest and <em>actually</em> fighting for the
    complete emancipation of the workers.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The <em>fact</em> that after a year&#8217;s
    &#8220;experience&#8221; the Soviets have deprived the exploiters
    of the franchise shows that the Soviets are really organisations
    of the oppressed and not of social-imperialists and
    social-pacifists who have sold themselves to the
    bourgeoisie. The <em>fact</em> that the Soviets have disfranchised
    the exploiters <em>shows</em> they are not organs of
    petty-bourgeois compromise with the capitalists, not organs
    of parliamentary chatter (on the part of the Kautskys, the
    Longuets and the MacDonalds), but organs of the genuinely
    revolutionary proletariat which is waging a
    life-and-death struggle against the exploiters.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kautsky&#8217;s book is almost unknown here,&#8221; a
    well-informed comrade wrote to me from Berlin a few days ago
    (today is
      October 30). I would advise our ambassadors in Germany and
    Switzerland not to stint thousands in buying up this book and 
      <em>distributing it gratis</em> amon the class-conscious workers
    so as to trample in the mud this &#8220;European&#8221;&#8212;read: imperialist and
    reformist&#8212;Social-Democracy, which has long been a &#8220;stinking
    corpse&#8221;. 
    </p>

    <center>* &#160; &#160; *</center>
    <center>*</center>

    <p>At the end of his book, on pages 61 and 63, Mr. Kautsky
      bitterly laments the fact that the &#8220;new theory&#8221; (as he
      calls Bolshevism, fearing to touch Marx&#8217;s and Engels&#8217;s
      analysis of the Paris Commune) &#8220;finds supporters even in old
      democracies like Switzerland, for instance&#8221;. &#8220;It is
      incomprehensible&#8221; to Kautsky &#8220;how this theory can be
      adopted by German Social-Democrats&#8221;.</p>
    
    <p>No, it is quite comprehensible; for after the serious lessons
    of the war the revolutionary masses are becoming sick and tired of
    the Scheidemanns and the Kautskys.</p>

    <p>&#8221;We&#8221; have always been in favour of democracy,
    Kautsky writes, yet we are supposed suddenly to renounce it!</p>

    <p>&#8221;We&#8221;, the opportunists of Social-Democracy,
    have always been opposed to the dictatorship of the proletariat,
    and Kolb and Co. proclaimed this <em>long ago.</em> Kautsky knows
    this and vainly expects that he will be able to conceal from his
    readers the obvious fact that he has &#8220;returned to the
    fold&#8221; of the Bernsteins and Kolbs.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We&#8221;, the revolutionary Marxists, have never made a
    fetish of &#8220;pure&#8221; (bourgeois) democracy. As is known,
    in 1903 Plekhanov was a revolutionary Marxist (later his
    unfortunate turn brought him to the position of a Russian
    Scheidemann).  And in that year Plekhanov declared at our Party
    Congress, which was then adopting its programme, that in the
    revolution the proletariat would, if necessary, disfranchise the
    capitalists and <em>disperse any parliament</em> that was found to
    be counter-revolutionary. That this is the only view that
    corresponds to Marxism will be clear to anybody even from the
    statements of Marx and Engels which I have quoted above; it
    patently follows from all the fundamental principles of
    Marxism.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We&#8221;, the revolutionary Marxists, never made
    speeches to the people that the Kautskyites of all nations love to
    make, cringing before the bourgeoisie, adapting themselves to the
    bourgeois parliamentary system, keeping silent about the
    <em>bourgeois</em> character of modern democracy and demanding
    only <em>its</em> extension, only that <em>it</em> be carried to
    its logical conclusion.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We&#8221; said to the bourgeoisie: You, exploiters and
    hypocrites, talk about democracy, while at every step you erect
    thousands of barriers to prevent the <em>oppressed people</em>
    from taking part in politics. We take you at your word and, in the
    interests of these people, demand the extension of <em>your</em>
    bourgeois democracy <em>in order to prepare the people for
    revolution</em> for the purpose of overthrowing you, the
    exploiters.  And if you exploiters attempt to offer resistance to
    our proletarian revolution we shall ruthlessly suppress you; we
    shall deprive you of all rights; more than that, we shall not give
    you any bread, for in our proletarian republic the exploiters will
    have no rights, they will be deprived of fire and water, for we
    are socialists in real earnest, and not in the Scheidemann or
    Kautsky fashion.</p>

    <p>That is what &#8220;we&#8221;, the revolutionary Marxists,
    said, and will say&#8212;and that is why the oppressed people will
    support us and be with us, while the Scheidemanns and the Kautskys
    will be swept into the renegades&#8217; cesspool.</p>

    This refers to a counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the Russian
    bourgeoisie in August 1917. Tsarist General Kornilov led the
    conspirators. Relying on the top army officers, they planned to
    use officer cadet and Cossack units to seize Petrograd, crush the
    Bolshevik Party, dissolve the Soviets and establish military
    dictatorship in the country. The workers of Petrograd and
    revolutionary soldiers and sailors rose up in response to the
    appeal of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party and crushed
    the Kornilov revolt. Popular pressure compelled the Provisional
    Government to order the arrest of Kornilov and his associates
    and bring them to court. Thus the attempt of the bourgeoisie and
    landowners to crush the revolution fell through. After the defeat
    of the Kornilov revolt the Bolsheviks gained more influence among
    the people. Bolshevisation of the Soviets began. The Bolsheviks
    again advanced the slogan &#8220;All Power to the Soviets!&#8221</p>

    <em>Lieberdans</em>&#8212;nickname for the Menshevik leaders Lieber and Dan
    and their supporters, which stuck to them after the Moscow
    Bolshevik newspaper <em>Sotsial-Demokrat</em> had published in its issue
    No. 141 on August 25 (September 7), 1917, Demyan Bedny&#8217;s feuilleton
    entitled &#8220;Lieberdan&#8221;.</p>

    <em>Activists</em>&#8212;a group of Mensheviks who resorted to
    armed struggle against Soviet power and the Bolshevik Party after
    the October Revolution. They joined various counter-revolutionary
    conspiratorial organisations, supported Kornilov, Kaledin and the
    bourgeois nationalist Ukrainian Rada, actively participated in the
    whiteguard Czech revolt and made common front with the foreign
    interventionists. In 1918, under the pretext of discussing the
    food situation, the &#8220;activists&#8221;, supported by the
    Menshevik Party, held a number of conferences of &#8220;workers&#8221; and
    their delegates which actually demanded the dissolution of the
    Soviets.</p>

    pages 305&ndash;313).</p>

    I have just read a leading article in <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/periodicals/f/r.htm#frankfurter-zeitung-handelsblatt"><em>Frankfurter
    Zeitung</em></a> (No. 293, October 22, 1918), giving an
    enthusiastic summary of Kautsky&#8217;s pamphlet. This organ of
    the stock exchange is satisfied. And no wonder! And a comrade
    writes to me from Berlin that <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/periodicals/v/o.htm#vorwarts"><em>Vorw&auml;rts,</em></a>
    the organ of the Scheidemanns, has declared in a special article
    that it subscribes to almost every line Kautsky has
    written. Hearty congratulations!</p>
