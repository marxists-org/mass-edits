    <h3>Subservience To The Bourgeoisie In The Guise of
      &#8220;Economic Analysis&#8221;</h3>

    <p class="fst">As has already been said, if the title of
    Kautsky&#8217;s book were properly to reflect its contents, it
    should have been called, not <em>The Dictatorship of the
    Proletariat</em>, but <em>A Rehash of Bourgeois Attacks on the
    Bolsheviks</em>.</p>

    <p>The old Menshevik &#8220;theories&#8221; about the bourgeois
    character of the Russian revolution, i.e., the old distortion of
    Marxism by the Mensheviks (<em>rejected</em> by Kautsky in 1905!),
    are now once again being rehashed by our theoretician. We must
    deal with this question, however boring it may be for Russian
    Marxists.</p>

    <p>The Russian revolution is a bourgeois revolution, said all the
    Marxists of Russia before 1905. The Mensheviks, substituting
    liberalism for Marxism, drew the following conclusion from this:
    the proletariat therefore must not go beyond what is acceptable to
    the bourgeoisie and must pursue a policy of compromise with
    them. The Bolsheviks said this was a bourgeois-liberal theory. The
    bourgeoisie were trying to bring about the reform of the state on
    bourgeois, <em>reformist</em>, not revolutionary lines, while
    preserving the monarchy, the landlord system, etc., as far as
    possible. The proletariat must carry through the
    bourgeois-democratic revolution to the end, not allowing itself to
    be &#8220;bound&#8221; by the reformism of the bourgeoisie. The
    Bolsheviks formulated the alignment of <em>class</em> forces in
    the bourgeois revolution as follows: the proletariat, winning over
    the peasants, will neutralise the liberal bourgeoisie and utterly
    destroy the monarchy, medievalism and the landlord system.</p>

    <p>It is the alliance between the proletariat and the peasants
    <em>in general</em> that reveals the bourgeois character of the
    revolution, for the peasants in general are small producers who
    exist on the basis of commodity production. Further, the
    Bolsheviks then added, the proletariat will win over <em>the
    entire semi-proletariat</em> (all the working and exploited
    people), will neutralise the middle peasants and <em>overthrow</em> the
    bourgeoisie; this will be a socialist revolution, as distinct from
    a bourgeois-democratic revolution. (See my pamphlet <em>Two Tactics</em>,
    published in 1905 and reprinted in <em>Twelve Years</em>,
    St. Petersburg, 1907.) 

    </p>
    <p>
      Kautsky took an indirect part in this
      controversy in 1905, when, in reply to an inquiry by the then
      Menshevik Plekhanov, he expressed an opinion that was essentially
      <em>against</em> Plekhanov, which provoked particular ridicule in
      the Bolshevik press at the time. But now Kautsky does <em>not</em> say
	<em>a single word</em> about the controversies of that time (for fear
      of being exposed by his own statements!), and thereby makes it
      utterly impossible for the German reader to understand the essence
      of the matter. Mr. Kautsky <em>could not</em> tell the German
      workers in 1918 that in 1905 he had been in favour of an alliance
      of the workers with the peasants and not with the liberal
      bourgeoisie, and on what conditions he had advocated this
      alliance, and what programme he had outlined for it.</p>

    <p>Backing out from his old position, Kautsky, under the guise of
    an &#8220;economic analysis&#8221;, and talking proudly about
    &#8220;historical materialism&#8221;, now advocates the
    subordination of the workers to the bourgeoisie, and, with the aid
    of quotations from the Menshevik Maslov, chews over the old
    liberal views of the Mensheviks. Quotations are used to prove the
    new idea of the backwardness of Russia. But the deduction drawn
    from this new idea is the old one, that in a bourgeois revolution
    one must not go farther than the bourgeoisie! And this in spite of
    all that Marx and Engels said when comparing the bourgeois
    revolution of 1789&ndash;93 in France with the bourgeois revolution of
    1848 in Germany! [Karl Marx, <em>The Bourgeoisie and the Counter-Revolution</em> (Marx         and Engels, <em>Selected Works</em>, Moscow, 1962, Vol. I, pp. 66&ndash;69).]</p>

    <p>Before passing to the chief &#8220;argument&#8221; and the main
    content of Kautsky&#8217;s &#8220;economic analysis&#8221;, let us
    note that Kautsky&#8217;s very first sentences reveal a curious
    confusion, or superficiality, of thought.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Agriculture, and specifically small peasant
    farming,&#8221; our &#8220;theoretician&#8221; announces,
    &#8220;to this day represents the economic foundation of
    Russia. About four-fifths, perhaps even five-sixths, of the
    population live by it&#8221; (p. 45). First of all, my dear
    theoretician, have you considered how many exploiters there may be
    among this mass of small producers? Certainly not more than
    one-tenth of the total, and in the towns still less, for there
    large-scale production is more highly developed. Take even an
    incredibly high figure; assume that one-fifth of the small
    producers are exploiters who are deprived of the franchise. Even
    then you will find that the 66 per cent of the votes held by the
    Bolsheviks at the Fifth Congress of Soviets represented the
    <em>majority of the population</em>. To this it must be added that
    there was always a considerable section of the Left
    Socialist-Revolutionaries who were in favour of Soviet power&#8212;in
    principle <em>all</em> the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were in
    favour of Soviet power, and when a section of them, in July 1918,
    started an adventurous revolt, two new parties split away from the
    old party, namely, the &#8220;Narodnik Communists&#8221; and the
    &#8220;Revolutionary Communists&#8221;<a id="bk33" href="#fw33"
    name="bk33"><sup class="enote">[33]</sup></a> (of the
    prominent Left Socialist-Revolutionaries who had been
    nominated for important posts in the government by the old party,
    to the first-mentioned belongs Zax, for instance, and to the
    second Kolegayev). So, Kautsky has himself&#8212;inadvertently&#8212;refuted
    the ridiculous fable that the Bolsheviks only have the backing of
    a minority of the population.</p>

    <p>Secondly, my dear theoretician, have you considered the fact
    that the small peasant producer <em>inevitably</em> vacillates
    between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie? This Marxist truth,
    which has been confirmed by the whole modern history of Europe,
    Kautsky very conveniently &#8220;forgot&#8221;, for it simply
    demolishes the Menshevik &#8220;theory&#8221; that he keeps
    repeating! Had Kautsky not &#8220;forgotten&#8221; this he could
    not have denied the need for a proletarian dictatorship in a
    country in which the small peasant producers predominate.</p>

    <p>Let us examine the main content of our theoretician&#8217;s
    &#8220;economic analysis&#8221;.</p>

    <p>That Soviet power is a dictatorship cannot be disputed, says
    Kautsky. &#8220;But is it a dictatorship of <em>the
    proletariat</em>?&#8221; (P. 34.)</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;According to the Soviet Constitution, the
    peasants form the majority of the population entitled to
    participate in legislation and administration. What is presented
    to us as a dictatorship of <em>the proletariat</em> would prove to
    be&#8212;if carried out consistently, and if, generally speaking,
    a class could directly exercise a dictatorship, which in reality
    can only be exercised by a party&#8212;a dictatorship of <em>the
    peasants</em>&#8221; (p. 35).</p>

    <p>And, highly elated over so profound and clever an argument, our
    good Kautsky tries to be witty and says: &#8220;It would appear,
    therefore, that the most painless achievement of socialism is best
    assured when it is put in the hands of the peasants&#8221;
    (p. 35).</p>

    <p>In the greatest detail, and citing a number of extremely
    learned quotations from the semi-liberal Maslov, our theoretician
    labours to prove the new idea that the peasants are interested in
    high grain prices, in low wages for the urban workers, etc.,
    etc. Incidentally, the enunciation of these new ideas is the more
    tedious the less attention our author pays to the really new
    features of the post-war period&#8212;for example, that the peasants
    demand for their grain, not money, but goods, and that they have
    not enough agricultural implements, which cannot be obtained in
    sufficient quantities for any amount of money. But more of this
    later.</p>

    <p>Thus, Kautsky charges the Bolsheviks, the party of the
    proletariat, with having surrendered the dictatorship, the work of
    achieving socialism, to the petty-bourgeois peasants. Excellent,
    Mr. Kautsky! But what, in your enlightened opinion, should have
    been the attitude of the proletarian party towards the
    petty-bourgeois peasants?</p>

    <p>Our theoretician preferred to say nothing on this score&#8212;evidently 
    bearing in mind the proverb: &#8220;Speech is silver,
    silence is gold.&#8221; But he gives himself away by the following
    argument:</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;At the beginning of the Soviet Republic,
    the peasants&#8217; Soviets were organisations of the
    <em>peasants</em> in general. Now this Republic proclaims that the
    Soviets are organisations of the proletarians and the <em>poor</em>
    peasants. The well-to-do peasants are deprived of the suffrage in
    the elections to the Soviets. The poor peasant is here recognised
    to be a permanent and mass product of the socialist agrarian
    reform under the &#8216;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8217;
    &#8221; (p. 48).</p>

    <p>What deadly irony! It is the kind that may be heard in Russia
    from any bourgeois: they all jeer and gloat over the fact that the
    Soviet Republic openly admits the existence of poor peasants. They
    ridicule socialism. That is their right. But a
    &#8220;socialist&#8221; who jeers at the fact that after four
    years of a most ruinous war there remain (and will remain for a
    long time) poor peasants in Russia&#8212;such a &#8220;socialist&#8221;
    could only have been born at a time of wholesale apostasy.</p>

    <p>And further:</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;. . . The Soviet Republic interferes in the
    relations between the rich and poor peasants, but not by
    redistributing the land. In order to relieve the bread shortage in
    the towns, detachments of armed workers are sent into the
    countryside to take away the rich peasants&#8217; surplus stocks
    of grain. Part of that stock is given to the urban population, the
    other&#8212;to the poorer peasants&#8221; (p. 48).</p>

    <p>Of course, Kautsky the socialist and Marxist is profoundly
    indignant at the idea that such a measure should be extended
    beyond the environs of the large towns (and we have extended it to
    the whole of the country). With the matchless, incomparable and
    admirable coolness (or pigheadedness) of a philistine, Kautsky the
    socialist and Marxist sermonises: . . . &#8220;It [the expropriation
    of the well-to-do peasants] introduces a new element of unrest and
    civil war into the process of production&#8221; . . . (civil war
    introduced into the &#8220;process of production&#8221;&#8212;that
    is something supernatural!) . . . &#8220;which stands in urgent need
    of peace and security for its recovery&#8221; (p. 49).</p>

    <p>Oh, yes, of course, Kautsky the Marxist and socialist must sigh
    and shed tears over the subject of peace and security for the
    exploiters and grain profiteers who hoard their surplus stocks,
    sabotage the grain monopoly law, and reduce the urban population
    to famine. &#8220;We are all socialists and Marxists and
    internationalists,&#8221; the Kautskys, Heinrich Webers<a
    id="bk34" href="#fw34" name="bk34"><sup
    class="enote">[34]</sup></a> (Vienna), Longuets (Paris),
    MacDonalds (London), etc., sing in chorus. &#8220;We are all in
    favour of a working-class revolution. Only . . . only we would like
    a revolution that does not infringe upon the peace and security of
    the grain profiteers! And we camouflage this sordid subservience
    to the capitalists by a &#8216;Marxist&#8217; reference to the
    &#8216;process of production&#8217;. . . . &#8221; If this is
    Marxism, what is servility to the bourgeoisie?</p>

    <p>Just see what our theoretician arrives at. He accuses the
    Bolsheviks of presenting the dictatorship of the peasants as the
    dictatorship of the proletariat. But at the same time he accuses
    us of introducing civil war into the rural districts (which we
    think is to our <em>credit</em>), of dispatching into the
    countryside armed detachments of workers, who publicly proclaim
    that they are exercising the &#8220;dictatorship of the
    proletariat and the poor peasants&#8221;, assist the latter and
    confiscate from the profiteers and the rich peasants the surplus
    stocks of grain which they are hoarding in contravention of the
    grain monopoly law.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, our Marxist theoretician stands for pure
    democracy, for the subordination of the revolutionary class, the
    leader of the working and exploited people, to the majority of the
    population (including, therefore, the exploiters). On the other
    hand, as an argument <em>against</em> us, he explains that the
    revolution must inevitably bear a bourgeois character&#8212;bourgeois,
    because the life of the peasants as a whole is based on bourgeois
    social relations&#8212;and at the same time he pretends to uphold the
    proletarian, class, Marxist point of view!</p>

    <p>Instead of an &#8220;economic analysis&#8221; we have a
    first-class hodge-podge. Instead of Marxism we have fragments of
    liberal doctrines and the preaching of servility to the
    bourgeoisie and the kulaks.</p>

    <p>The question which Kautsky has so tangled up was fully
    explained by the Bolsheviks as far back as 1905. Yes, our
    revolution is a bourgeois revolution <em>as long</em> as we march
    <em>with</em> the peasants <em>as a whole.</em> This has been as
    clear as clear can be to us; we have said it hundreds and
    thousands of times since 1905, and we have never attempted to skip
    this necessary stage of the historical process or abolish it by
    decrees. Kautsky&#8217;s efforts to &#8220;expose&#8221; us on
    this point merely expose his own confusion of mind and his fear to
    recall what he wrote in 1905, when he was not yet a renegade.</p>

    <p>Beginning with <em>April</em> 1917, however, long before the October
    Revolution, that is, long before we assumed power, we publicly
    declared and explained to the people: the revolution cannot now
    stop at this stage, for the country has marched forward,
    capitalism has advanced, ruin has reached fantastic dimensions,
    which (whether one likes it or not) <em>will demand</em> steps forward,
    <em>to socialism.</em> For there is <em>no</em> other way of
    advancing, of saving the war-weary country and of
    <em>alleviating</em> the sufferings of the working and exploited
    people.</p>

    <p>Things have turned out just as we said they would. The course
    taken by the revolution has confirmed the correctness of our
    reasoning. <em>First</em>, with the &#8220;whole&#8221; of the
    peasants against the monarchy, against the landowners, against
    medievalism (and to that extent the revolution remains bourgeois,
    bourgeois-democratic). <em>Then</em>, with the poor peasants, with
    the semi-proletarians, with all the exploited, <em>against
    capitalism</em>, including the rural rich, the kulaks, the
    profiteers, and to that extent the revolution becomes a
    <em>socialist</em> one. To attempt to raise an artificial Chinese
    Wall between the first and second, to separate them <em>by
    anything else</em> than the degree of preparedness of the
    proletariat and the degree of its unity with the poor peasants,
    means to distort Marxism dreadfully, to vulgarise it, to
    substitute liberalism in its place. It means smuggling in a
    reactionary defence of the bourgeoisie against the socialist
    proletariat by means of quasi-scientific references to the
    progressive character of the bourgeoisie in comparison with
    medievalism.</p>

    <p>Incidentally, the Soviets represent an immensely higher form
    and type of democracy just because, by uniting and drawing the
    <em>mass of workers and peasants</em> into political life, they
    serve as a most sensitive barometer, the one closest to the
    &#8220;people&#8221; (in the sense in which Marx, in 1871, spoke
    of a real people&#8217;s revolution<a id="bk35" href="#fw35"
    name="bk35"><sup class="enote">[35]</sup></a>), of the growth and
    development of the political, class maturity of the people. The
    Soviet Constitution was not drawn up according to some
    &#8220;plan&#8221;; it was not drawn up in a study, and was not
    foisted on the working people by bourgeois lawyers. No, this
    Constitution <em>grew up</em> in the course of the development of
    <em>the class struggle</em> in proportion as <em>class
    antagonisms</em> matured. The very facts which Kautsky himself has
    to admit prove this.</p>

    <p>At first, the Soviets embraced the peasants as a whole. It was
    owing to the immaturity, the backwardness, the ignorance of the
    poor peasants that the leadership passed into the hands of the
    kulaks, the rich, the capitalists and the petty-bourgeois
    intellectuals. That was the period of the domination of the petty
    bourgeoisie, of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries (only
    fools or renegades like Kautsky can regard either of these as
    socialists). The petty bourgeoisie inevitably and unavoidably
    vacillated between the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (Kerensky,
    Kornilov, Savinkov) and the dictatorship of the proletariat; for
    owing to the basic features of its economic position, the petty
    bourgeoisie is incapable of doing anything independently. Kautsky,
    by the way, completely renounces Marxism by confining himself in
    his analysis of the Russian revolution to the legal and formal
    concept of &#8220;democracy&#8221;, which serves the bourgeoisie
    as a screen to conceal their domination and as a means of
    deceiving the people, and by <em>forgetting</em> that in practice
    &#8220;democracy&#8221; sometimes stands for the <em>dictatorship
    of the bourgeoisie</em>, sometimes for the impotent reformism of
    the petty bourgeoisie who submit to that dictatorship, and so
    on. According to Kautsky, in a capitalist country there were
    bourgeois parties and there was a proletarian party (the
    Bolsheviks), which led the majority, the mass of the proletariat,
    but <em>there were no</em> petty-bourgeois parties! The Mensheviks
    and Socialist-Revolutionaries had no <em>class roots</em>, no
    petty-bourgeois roots!</p>

    <p>The vacillations of the petty bourgeoisie, of the Mensheviks
    and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, helped to enlighten the people
    and to repel the overwhelming majority of them, all the
    &#8220;lower sections&#8221;, all the proletarians and
    semi-proletarians, from such &#8220;leaders&#8221;. The Bolsheviks
    won predominance in the Soviets (in Petrograd and Moscow by
    October 1917); the split among the Socialist-Revolutionaries and
    the Mensheviks became more pronounced.</p>

    <p>The victorious Bolshevik revolution meant the end of
    vacillation, meant the complete destruction of the monarchy and of
    the landlord system (which had <em>not</em> been destroyed before
    the October Revolution). We carried the <em>bourgeois</em> revolution
    <em>to its conclusion</em>. The peasants supported us <em>as a
    whole.</em> Their antagonism to the socialist proletariat could
    not reveal itself all at once. The Soviets united the peasants
    <em>in general.</em> The class divisions among the peasants had
    not yet matured, had not yet come into the open.</p>

    <p><em>That</em> process took place in the summer and autumn of
    1918. The Czech counter-revolutionary mutiny roused the kulaks. A
    wave of kulak revolts swept over Russia. The poor peasants
    learned, not from books or newspapers, <em>but from life
    itself</em>, that their interests were irreconcilably antagonistic
    to those of the kulaks, the rich, the rural bourgeoisie. Like
    every other petty-bourgeois party, the &#8220;Left
    Socialist-Revolutionaries&#8221; reflected the vacillation of the
    people, and in the summer of 1918 they split: one section joined
    forces with the Czechs (the rebellion in Moscow, when Proshyan,
    having seized the Telegraph Office&#8212;for one hour!&#8212;announced to
    Russia that the Bolsheviks had been overthrown; then the treachery
    of Muravyov,<a id="bk36" href="#fw36" name="bk36"><sup
    class="enote">[36]</sup></a> Commander-in-Chief of the army that
    was fighting the Czechs, etc.), while the other section, that
    mentioned above, remained with the Bolsheviks.</p>

    <p>The growing food shortage in the towns lent increasing urgency
    to the question of the grain monopoly (this Kautsky the
    theoretician completely &#8220;forgot&#8221; in his economic
    analysis, which is a mere repetition of platitudes gleaned ten
    years ago from Maslov&#8217;s writings!).</p>

    <p>The old landowner and bourgeois, and even
    democratic-republican, state had sent to the rural districts armed
    detachments which were practically at the beck and call of the
    bourgeoisie. Mr. Kautsky does not know this! He does not regard
    that as the &#8220;dictatorship of the bourgeoisie&#8221;&#8212;Heaven
    forbid! That is &#8220;pure democracy&#8221;, especially if
    endorsed by a bourgeois parliament! Nor has Kautsky
    &#8220;heard&#8221; that, in the summer and autumn of 1917,
    Avksentyev and S. Maslov, in company with the Kerenskys, the
    Tseretelis and other Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks,
    arrested members of the Land Committees; he does not say a word
    about that!</p>

    <p>The whole point is that a bourgeois state which is exercising
    the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie through a democratic republic
    cannot confess to the people that it is serving the bourgeoisie;
    it cannot tell the truth, and has to play the hypocrite.</p>

    <p>But the state of the Paris Commune type, the Soviet state,
    openly and frankly tells the people the <em>truth</em> and
    declares that it is the dictatorship of the proletariat and the
    poor peasants; and by this truth it wins over scores and scores of
    millions of new citizens who are kept down in any democratic
    republic, but who are drawn by the Soviets into political life,
    into <em>democracy</em>, into the administration of the state. The
    Soviet Republic sends into the rural districts detachments of
    armed workers, primarily the more advanced, from the
    capitals. These workers carry socialism into the countryside, win
    over the poor, organise and enlighten them, and help them to
    <em>suppress the resistance of the bourgeoisie.</em></p>

    <p>All who are familiar with the situation and have been in the
    rural districts declare that it is only now, in the summer and
    autumn of 1918, that the rural districts <em>themselves</em> are
    passing through the &#8220;October&#8221; (i.e., proletarian)
    Revolution. Things are beginning to change. The wave of kulak
    revolts is giving way to a rise of the poor, to a growth of the
    &#8220;Poor Peasants&#8217; Committees&#8221;. In the army, the
    number of workers who become commissars, officers and commanders
    of divisions and armies is increasing. And at the very time that
    the simple-minded Kautsky, frightened by the July (1918)
    crisis<a id="bk37" href="#fw37" name="bk37"><sup
    class="enote">[37]</sup></a> and the lamentations of the
    bourgeoisie, was running after the latter like a cockerel, and
    writing a whole pamphlet breathing the conviction that the
    Bolsheviks are on the eve of being overthrown by the peasants; at
    the very time that this simpleton regarded the secession of the
    Left Socialist-Revolutionaries as a &#8220;narrowing&#8221;
    (p. 37) of the circle of those who support the Bolsheviks</em> at
    that very time the <em>real</em> circle of supporters of
    Bolshevism was <em>expanding enormously</em>, because scores and
    scores of millions of the village poor were freeing themselves
    from the tutelage and influence of the kulaks and village
    bourgeoisie and were awakening to <em>independent</em> political
    life.</p>

    <p>We have lost hundreds of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries,
    spineless intellectuals and kulaks from among the peasants; but we
    have gained millions of poor people.<span class="inote">[At the
    Sixth Congress of Soviets (November 6&ndash;9, 1918), there were 967
    voting delegates, 950 of whom were Bolsheviks, and 351 delegates
    with voice but no vote, of whom 335 were Bolsheviks, i.e., 97 per
    cent of the total number of delegates were Bolsheviks.]</span></p>

    <p>A year after the proletarian revolution in the capitals, and
    under its influence and with its assistance, the proletarian
    revolution began in the remote rural districts, and it has finally
    consolidated the power of the Soviets and Bolshevism, and has
    finally proved there is no force in the country that can withstand
    it.</p>

    <p>Having completed the bourgeois-democratic revolution in
    alliance with the peasants as a whole, the Russian proletariat
    finally passed on to the socialist revolution when it succeeded in
    splitting the rural population, in winning over the rural
    proletarians and semi-proletarians, and in uniting them against
    the kulaks and the bourgeoisie, including the peasant
    bourgeoisie.</p>

    <p>Now, if the Bolshevik proletariat in the capitals and large
    industrial centres had not been able to rally the village poor
    around itself against the rich peasants, this would indeed have
    proved that Russia was &#8220;unripe&#8221; for socialist
    revolution. The peasants would then have remained an
    &#8220;integral whole&#8221;, i.e., they would have remained under
    the economic, political, and moral leadership of the kulaks, the
    rich, the bourgeoisie, and the revolution would not have passed
    beyond the limits of a bourgeois-democratic revolution. (But, let
    it be said in parenthesis, even if this had been the case, it
    would not have proved that the proletariat should not have taken
    power, for it is the proletariat alone that has really carried the
    bourgeois-democratic revolution to its conclusion, it is the
    proletariat alone that has done something really important to
    bring nearer the world proletarian revolution, and the proletariat
    alone that has created the Soviet state, which, after the Paris
    Commune, is the second step towards the socialist state.)</p>

    <p>On the other hand, if the Bolshevik proletariat had tried at
    once, in October&ndash;November 1917, without waiting for the class
    differentiation in the rural districts, without being able to
    <em>prepare</em> it and bring it about, to &#8220;decree&#8221; a
    civil war or the &#8220;introduction of socialism&#8221; in the
    rural districts, had tried to do without a temporary bloc with the
    peasants in general, without making a number of concessions to the
    middle peasants, etc., that would have been a <em>Blanquist</em><a
    id="bk38" href="#fw38" name="bk38"><sup
    class="enote">[38]</sup></a> distortion of Marxism, an attempt by
    the <em>minority</em> to impose its will upon the majority; it would
    have been a theoretical absurdity, revealing a failure to
    understand that a general peasant revolution is <em>still</em> a
    bourgeois revolution, and that without <em>a series of transitions</em>, <em>of
    transitional stages</em>, it cannot be transformed into a socialist
    revolution in a backward country.</p>

    <p>Kautsky has confused <em>everything</em> in this very important
    theoretical and political problem, and has, in practice, proved to
    be nothing but a servant of the bourgeoisie, howling against the
    dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>

    <center>* &#160; &#160; *</center>
    <center>*</center>

    <p>Kautsky has introduced a similar, if not greater, confusion
    into another extremely interesting and important question, namely:
    was the <em>legislative</em> activity of the Soviet Republic in
    the sphere of agrarian reform&#8212;that most difficult and yet most
    important of socialist reforms&#8212;based on sound principles and then
    properly carried out? We should be boundlessly grateful to any
    West-European Marxist who, after studying at least the most
    important documents, gave a <em>criticism</em> of our policy,
    because he would thereby help us immensely, and would also help
    the revolution that is maturing throughout the world. But instead
    of criticism Kautsky produces an incredible theoretical muddle,
    which converts Marxism into liberalism and which, in practice, is
    a series of idle, venomous, vulgar sallies against the
    Bolsheviks. Let the reader judge for himself:</p>

    <p>&#8220;Large landed estates could not be preserved. This was a
    result of the revolution. That was at once clear. The transfer of
    the large estates to the peasant population became inevitable. . . .&#8221; 
    (That is not true, Mr. Kautsky. You substitute what is
    &#8220;clear&#8221; to you for the attitude of the different
    <em>classes</em> towards the question. The history of the
    revolution has shown that the coalition government of the
    bourgeois and the petty bourgeois, the Mensheviks and the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, pursued a policy of preserving big
    landownership. This was proved particularly by S. Maslov&#8217;s
    bill and by the arrest of the members of the Land Committees.<a
    id="bk39" href="#fw39" name="bk39"><sup
    class="enote">[39]</sup></a> Without the dictatorship of the
    proletariat, the &#8220;peasant population&#8221; would not have
    vanquished the landowners, who had joined forces with the
    capitalists.)</p>

    <p>&#8220;But as to the forms in which it was to take place, there
    was no unity. Various solutions were conceivable. . . .&#8221;
    (Kautsky is most of all concerned about the &#8220;unity&#8221; of
    the &#8220;socialists&#8221;, no matter who called themselves by
    that name. He forgets that the principal classes in capitalist
    society are bound to arrive at different solutions.)
    &#8220;. . . From the socialist point of view, the most rational
    solution would have been to convert the large estates into state
    property and to allow the peasants who hitherto had been employed
    on them as wage-labourers to cultivate them in the form of
    co-operative societies. But such a solution presupposes the
    existence of a type of farm labourer that did not exist in
    Russia. Another solution would have been to convert the large
    estates into state property and to divide them up into small plots
    to be rented out to peasants who owned little land. Had that been
    done, at least something socialistic would have been achieved. . . .&#8221;</p>

    <p>As usual Kautsky confines himself to the celebrated: on the one
    hand it cannot but be admitted, and on the other hand it must be
    confessed. He places different solutions <em>side by side</em>
    without a thought&#8212;the only, realistic and Marxist thought&#8212;as to
    what must be the <em>transitional stages</em> from capitalism to
    communism in such-and-such <em>specific</em> conditions. There are
    farm labourers in Russia, but not many; and Kautsky did not touch
    on the question which the Soviet government <em>did</em> raise&#8212;of
    the method of transition to a communal and co-operative form of
    land cultivation. The most curious thing, however, is that Kautsky
    claims to see &#8220;something socialistic&#8221; in the renting
    out of small plots of land. In reality, this is a
    <em>petty-bourgeois</em> slogan, and there is <em>nothing</em>
    &#8220;socialistic&#8221; in it. If the &#8220;state&#8221; that
    rents out the land is <em>not</em> a state of the Paris Commune
    type, but a parliamentary bourgeois republic (and that is exactly
    Kautsky&#8217;s constant assumption), the renting of land in small
    plots is a typical <em>liberal reform.</em></p>

    <p>Kautsky says nothing about the Soviet government having
    abolished <em>all</em> private ownership of land. Worse than that:
    he resorts to an incredible forgery and quotes the decrees of the
    Soviet government in such a way as to omit the most essential.</p>

    <p>After stating that &#8220;small production strives for complete
    private ownership of the means of production&#8221;, and that the
    Constituent Assembly would have been the &#8220;only
    authority&#8221; capable of preventing the dividing up of the land
    (an assertion which will evoke laughter in Russia, where everybody
    knows that the Soviets <em>alone</em> are recognised as authoritative by
    the workers and peasants, while the Constituent Assembly has
    become the slogan of the Czechs and the landowners), Kautsky
    continues:</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;One of the first decrees of the Soviet
    Government declared that: (1) Landed proprietorship is abolished
    forthwith without any compensation. (2) The landed estates, as
    also all crown, monastery and church lands, with all their
    livestock, implements, buildings and everything pertaining
    thereto, shall be placed at the disposal of the volost Land
    Committees of the uyezd Soviets of Peasants&#8217; Deputies
    pending the settlement of the land question by the Constituent
    Assembly.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Having quoted <em>only these two clauses</em>, Kautsky
    concludes:</p>

    <p>&#8220;The reference to the Constituent Assembly has remained a
    dead letter. In point of fact, the peasants in the separate
    volosts could do as they pleased with the land&#8221; (p. 47).</p>

    <p>Here you have an example of Kautsky&#8217;s
    &#8220;criticism&#8221;! Here you have a &#8220;scientific&#8221;
    work which is more like a fraud. The German reader is induced to
    believe that the Bolsheviks capitulated before the peasants on the
    question of private ownership of land, that the Bolsheviks
    permitted the peasants to act locally (&#8220;in the separate
    volosts&#8221;) in whatever way they pleased!</p>

    <p>But in reality, the decree Kautsky quotes&#8212;the first to be
    promulgated, on October 26, 1917 (old style)&#8212;consists not of two,
    but of five clauses, <em>plus</em> eight clauses of the Mandate, which, it
    was expressly stated, &#8220;shall serve as a guide&#8221;.</p>

    <p>Clause 3 of the decree states that the estates are transferred
    &#8221;<em>to the people</em>&#8221;, and the &#8220;exact
    inventories of all property confiscated&#8221; shall be drawn up
    and the property &#8220;protected in the strictest revolutionary
    way&#8221;. And the Mandate declares that &#8220;private ownership
    of land shall be abolished for ever&#8221;, that &#8220;lands on
    which high-level scientific farming is practised . . . <em>shall not
    be divided up</em>&#8221;, that &#8220;all livestock and farm
    implements of the confiscated estates shall pass into the
    exclusive use of the state or a commune, depending on size and
    importance, and no compensation shall be paid for this&#8221;, and
    that &#8220;all land shall become part of the national land
    fund&#8221;.</p>

    <p>Further, simultaneously with the dissolution of the Constituent
    Assembly (January 5, 1918), the Third Congress of Soviets adopted
    the <em>Declaration of Rights</em> of the Working and Exploited
    People, which now forms part of the Fundamental Law of the Soviet
    Republic. Article 2, paragraph 1 of this Declaration states that
    &#8220;private ownership of land is hereby abolished&#8221;, and
    that &#8220;model estates and agricultural enterprises are
    proclaimed national property&#8221;.</p>

    <p>So, the reference to the Constituent Assembly did <em>not</em>
    remain a dead letter, because another national representative
    body, immeasurably more authoritative in the eyes of the peasants,
    took upon itself the solution of the agrarian problem.</p>

    <p>Again, on February 6(19), 1918, the land socialisation law was
    promulgated, which once more confirmed the abolition of all
    private ownership of land, and placed the land and <em>all
    private</em> stock and implements at the disposal of the Soviet
    authorities <em>under the control of the federal Soviet
    government</em>. Among the duties connected with the disposal of
    the land, the law prescribed:</p>

    <p>&#8220;the development of collective farming as more
    advantageous from the point of view of economy of labour and
    produce, at the expense of individual farming, with a view to
    transition to socialist farming&#8221; (Article 11, paragraph
    e).</p>

    <p>The same law, in establishing the principle of <em>equal</em>
    land tenure, replied to the fundamental question: &#8220;Who has a
    right to the use of the land?&#8221; in the following manner:</p>

    <p>(Article 20.) &#8220;Plots of land surface within the borders
    of the Russian Soviet Federative Republic may be used for public
    and private needs. A. For cultural and educational purposes: (1)
    by the state as represented by the organs of Soviet power
    (federal, as well as in regions, gubernias, uyezds, volosts, and
    villages), and (2) by public bodies (under the control, and with
    the permission, of the local Soviet authorities); B. For
    agricultural purposes: (3) by agricultural communes, (4) by
    agricultural co-operative societies, (5) by village communities,
    (6) by individual families and persons. . . .&#8221;</p>

    <p>The reader will see that Kautsky has completely distorted the
    facts, and has given the German reader an absolutely false view of
    the agrarian policy and agrarian legislation of the proletarian
    state in Russia.</p>

    <p>Kautsky proved even unable to formulate the theoretically
    important fundamental questions!</p>

    <p>These questions are:</p>

    <p>(1) Equal land tenure and</p>

    <p>(2) Nationalisation of the land&#8212;the relation of these two
    measures to socialism in general, and to the transition from
    capitalism to communism in particular.</p>

    <p>(3) Farming in common as a transition from small scattered
    farming to large-scale collective farming; does the manner in
    which this question is dealt with in Soviet legislation meet the
    requirements of socialism?</p>

    <p>On the first question it is necessary, first of all, to
    establish the following two fundamental facts: (a) in reviewing
    the experience of 1905 (I may refer, for instance, to my work on
    the agrarian problem in the First Russian Revolution), the
    Bolsheviks pointed to the democratically progressive, the
    democratically revolutionary meaning of the slogan &#8220;equal
    land tenure&#8221;, and in 1917, <em>before</em> the October
    Revolution, they spoke of this quite definitely; (b) when
    enforcing the land socialisation law&#8212;the &#8220;spirit&#8221; of
    which is equal land tenure&#8212;the Bolsheviks most explicitly and
    definitely declared: this is not our idea, we do not agree with
    this slogan, but we think it our duty to enforce it because this
    is the demand of the overwhelming majority of the peasants. And
    the idea and demands of the majority of the working people are
    things that the working people must <em>discard of their own
    accord</em>: such demands cannot be either &#8220;abolished&#8221;
    or &#8220;skipped over&#8221;. We Bolsheviks shall <em>help</em>
    the peasants to discard petty-bourgeois slogans, to <em>pass</em>
    from them as quickly and as easily as possible to socialist
    slogans.</p>

    <p>A Marxist theoretician who wanted to help the working-class
    revolution by his scientific analysis should have answered the
    following questions: first, is it true that the idea of equal land
    tenure has a democratically revolutionary meaning of carrying the
    <em>bourgeois</em>-democratic revolution to its conclusion? Secondly, did
    the Bolsheviks act rightly in helping to pass by their votes (and
    in most loyally observing) the petty-bourgeois equal land tenure
    law?</p>

    <p>Kautsky failed even to <em>perceive</em> what, theoretically,
    was the crux of the problem!</p>

    <p>Kautsky will never be able to refute the view that the idea of
    equal land tenure has a progressive and revolutionary value in the
    bourgeois-democratic revolution. Such a revolution cannot go
    beyond this. By reaching its limit, it <em>all the more
    clearly, rapidly</em> and <em>easily</em> reveals to the people the
    <em>inadequacy </em> of bourgeois-democratic solutions and the
    necessity of proceeding beyond their limits, of passing on to
    <em>socialism</em>.</p>

    <p>The peasants, who have overthrown tsarism and the landowners,
    dream of equal land tenure, and no power on earth could have
    stopped the peasants, once they had been freed both from the
    landowners and from the <em>bourgeois</em> parliamentary
    republican state. The workers say to the peasants: We shall help
    you reach &#8220;ideal&#8221; capitalism, for equal land tenure is
    the idealisation of capitalism by the small producer. At the same
    time we shall prove to you its inadequacy and the necessity of
    passing to farming in common.</p>

    <p>It would be interesting to see Kautsky&#8217;s attempt to
    disprove that <em>this kind</em> of leadership of the peasant
    struggle by the proletariat was right.</p>

    <p>Kautsky, however, preferred to evade the question
    altogether . . .</p>

    <p>Next, Kautsky deliberately deceived his German readers by
    withholding from them the fact that in its <em>land law</em> the
    Soviet government gave <em>direct</em> preference to communes and
    co-operative societies.</p>

    <p>With all the peasants right through to the end of the
    bourgeois-democratic revolution; and with the poor, the
    proletarian and semi-proletarian section of the peasants, forward
    to the socialist revolution! That has been the policy of the
    Bolsheviks, and it is the only Marxist policy.</p>

    <p>But Kautsky is all muddled and incapable of formulating a
    single question! On the one hand, he <em>dare not</em> say that
    the workers should have parted company with the peasants over the
    question of equal land tenure, for he realises that it would have
    been absurd (and, moreover, in 1905, when he was not yet a
    renegade, he himself clearly and explicitly advocated an alliance
    between the workers and peasants as a condition for the victory of
    the revolution). On the other hand, he sympathetically quotes the
    liberal platitudes of the Menshevik Maslov, who
    &#8220;proves&#8221; that petty-bourgeois equal land tenure is
    utopian and reactionary from the point of view of socialism, but
    hushes up the progressive and revolutionary character of the
    petty-bourgeois struggle for equality and equal tenure <em>from
    the point of view of the bourgeois-democratic revolution</em>.</p>

    <p>Kautsky is in a hopeless muddle: note that he (in 1918) <em>insists</em>
    on the <em>bourgeois</em> character of the Russian revolution.
    He (in 1918) peremptorily says: Don&#8217;t go beyond these
    limits! Yet this very same Kautsky sees &#8220;something
    <em>socialistic</em>&#8221; (for a <em>bourgeois</em> revolution) in the
    <em>petty-bourgeois</em> reform of renting out small plots of land to
    the <em>poor</em> peasants (which is an approximation to equal land
    tenure)!! 

    </p>
    <p>
      Understand this if you can!</p>

    <p>In addition to all this, Kautsky displays a philistine
    inability to take into account the real policy of a definite
    party. He quotes the empty <em>phrases</em> of the Menshevik
    Maslov and <em>refuses to see the real</em> policy the Menshevik
    Party pursued in 1917, when, in &#8220;coalition&#8221; with the
    landowners and Cadets, they advocated what was virtually a
    <em>liberal agrarian reform and compromise with the
    landowners</em> (proof: the arrest of the members of the Land
    Committees and S. Maslov&#8217;s land bill).</p>

    <p>Kautsky failed to notice that P. Maslov&#8217;s phrases about
    the reactionary and utopian character of petty-bourgeois equality
    are really a screen to conceal the Menshevik policy of
    <em>compromise</em> between the peasants and the landowners (i.e.,
    of supporting the landowners in duping the peasants), instead of
    the <em>revolutionary</em> overthrow of the landowners by the
    peasants.</p>

    <p>What a &#8220;Marxist&#8221; Kautsky is!</p>

    <p>It was the Bolsheviks who strictly differentiated between the
    bourgeois-democratic revolution and the socialist revolution: by
    carrying the former through, they opened the door for the
    transition to the latter. This was the only policy that was
    revolutionary and Marxist.</p>

    <p>It would have been wiser for Kautsky not to repeat the feeble
    liberal witticism: &#8220;Never yet have the small peasants
    anywhere adopted collective farming under the influence of
    theoretical convictions&#8221; (p. 50).</p>

    <p>How very smart!</p>

    <p>But never as yet and nowhere have the small peasants of any
    large country been under the influence of a proletarian state.</p>

    <p>Never as yet and nowhere have the small peasants engaged in an
    open class struggle reaching the extent of a civil war between the
    poor peasants and the rich peasants, <em>with</em> propagandist,
    political, economic and military support given to the poor by a
    proletarian state.</p>

    <p>Never as yet and nowhere have the profiteers and the rich
    amassed such wealth out of war, while the mass of peasants have
    been so utterly ruined.</p>

    <p>Kautsky just reiterates the old stuff, he just chews the old
    cud, afraid even to give thought to the new tasks of the
    proletarian dictatorship.</p>

    <p>But what, dear Kautsky, if the peasants <em>lack</em>
    implements for small-scale farming and the proletarian state
    <em>helps</em> them to obtain machines for collective farming&#8212;is
    that a &#8220;theoretical conviction&#8221;?</p>

    <p>We shall now pass to the question of nationalisation of the
    land. Our Narodniks, including all the Left
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, deny that the measure we have adopted
    is nationalisation of the land. They are wrong in theory. Insofar
    as we remain within the framework of commodity production and
    capitalism, the abolition of private ownership of land is
    nationalisation of the land. The term &#8220;socialisation&#8221;
    merely expresses a tendency, a desire, the preparation for the
    transition to socialism.</p>

    <p>What should be the attitude of Marxists towards nationalisation
    of the land?</p>

    <p>Here, too, Kautsky fails even to formulate the theoretical
    question, or, which is still worse, he deliberately evades it,
    although one knows from Russian literature that Kautsky is aware
    of the old controversies among the Russian Marxists on the
    question of nationalisation, municipalisation (i.e., the transfer
    of the large estates to the local self-government authorities), or
    division of the land.</p>

    <p>Kautsky&#8217;s assertion that to transfer the large estates to
    the state and rent them out in small plots to peasants who own
    little land would be achieving &#8220;something socialistic&#8221;
    is a downright mockery of Marxism. We have already shown that
    there is nothing socialistic about it. But that is not all; it
    would not even be carrying the <em>bourgeois-democratic</em> revolution
    to its conclusion. Kautsky&#8217;s great misfortune is that
    he placed his trust in the Mensheviks. Hence the curious position
    that while insisting on our revolution having a bourgeois
    character and reproaching the Bolsheviks for taking it into their
    heads to proceed to socialism, he <em>himself</em> proposes a liberal
    reform under the guise of socialism, <em>without carrying this reform</em>
    to the point of completely clearing away all the survivals of
    medievalism in agrarian relations! The arguments of Kautsky, as of
    his Menshevik advisers, amount to a defence of the liberal
    bourgeoisie, who fear revolution, instead of defence of consistent
    bourgeois-democratic revolution.</p>

    <p>Indeed, why should only the large estates, and not all the
    land, be converted into state property? The liberal bourgeoisie
    thereby achieve the maximum preservation of the old conditions
    (i.e., the least consistency in revolution) and the maximum
    facility for a reversion to the old conditions. The radical
    bourgeoisie, i.e., the bourgeoisie that want to carry the
    bourgeois revolution to its conclusion, put forward the slogan of
    <em>nationalisation of the land</em>.</p>

    <p>Kautsky, who in the dim and distant past, some twenty years
    ago, wrote an excellent Marxist work on the agrarian question,
    cannot but know that Marx declared that land nationalisation is in
    fact a <em>consistent</em> slogan of the <em>bourgeoisie</em>.<a
    id="bk40" href="#fw40" name="bk40"><sup
    class="enote">[40]</sup></a> Kautsky cannot but be aware of
    Marx&#8217;s controversy with Rodbertus, and Marx&#8217;s
    remarkable passages in his <em>Theories of Surplus Value</em>
    where the revolutionary significance&#8212;in the bourgeois-democratic
    sense&#8212;of land nationalisation is explained with particular
    clarity.</p>

    <p>The Menshevik P. Maslov, whom Kautsky, unfortunately for
    himself, chose as an adviser, denied that the Russian peasants
    would agree to the nationalisation of all the land (including the
    peasants&#8217; lands). To a certain extent, this view of
    Maslov&#8217;s could be connected with his &#8220;original&#8221;
    theory (which merely parrots the bourgeois critics of Marx),
    namely, his repudiation of absolute rent and his recognition of
    the &#8220;law&#8221; (or &#8220;fact&#8221;, as Maslov expressed
    it) &#8220;of diminishing returns&#8221;.</p>

    <p>In point of fact, however, already the 1905 Revolution revealed
    that the vast majority of the peasants in Russia, members of
    village communes as well as homestead peasants, were in favour of
    nationalisation of all the land. The 1917 Revolution confirmed
    this, and after the assumption of power by the proletariat this
    was done. The Bolsheviks remained loyal to Marxism and never tried
    (in spite of Kautsky, who, without a scrap of evidence, accuses us
    of doing so) to &#8220;skip&#8221; the bourgeois-democratic
    revolution. The Bolsheviks, first of all, helped the most radical,
    most revolutionary of the bourgeois-democratic ideologists of the
    peasants, those who stood closest to the proletariat, namely, the
    Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, to carry out what was in effect
    nationalisation of the land. On October 20, 1917, i.e., on the
    very first day of the proletarian, socialist revolution, private
    ownership of land was abolished in Russia.</p>

    <p>This laid the foundation, the most perfect from the point of
    view of the development of capitalism (Kautsky cannot deny this
    without breaking with Marx), and at the same time created an
    agrarian system which is the <em>most flexible</em> from the point
    of view of the transition to socialism. From the
    bourgeois-democratic point of view, the revolutionary peasants in
    Russia <em>could go no farther</em>: <em>there can be nothing</em> &#8220;more
    ideal&#8221; from this point of view, nothing &#8220;more
    radical&#8221; (from this same point of view) than nationalisation
    of the land and equal land tenure. It was the Bolsheviks, and only
    the Bolsheviks, who, thanks only to the victory of the
    <em>proletarian</em> revolution, helped the peasants to carry the
    bourgeois-democratic revolution really to its conclusion. And only
    in this way did they do the utmost to facilitate and accelerate
    the transition to the socialist revolution.</p>

    <p>One can judge from this what an incredible muddle Kautsky
    offers to his readers when he accuses the Bolsheviks of failing to
    understand the bourgeois character of the revolution, and yet
    himself betrays such a departure from Marxism that he <em>says
    nothing</em> about nationalisation of the land and presents the
    least revolutionary (from the bourgeois point of view) liberal
    agrarian reform as &#8220;something socialistic&#8221;!</p>

    <p>We have now come to the third question formulated above,
    namely, to what extent the proletarian dictatorship in Russia has
    taken into account the necessity of passing to farming in
    common. Here again, Kautsky commits something very much in the
    nature of a forgery: he quotes only the &#8220;theses&#8221; of
    one Bolshevik which speak of the task of passing to farming in
    common! After quoting one of these theses, our
    &#8220;theoretician&#8221; triumphantly exclaims:</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;Unfortunately, a task is not accomplished
    by the fact that it is called a task. For the time being,
    collective farming in Russia is doomed to remain on paper
    only. Never yet have the small peasants anywhere adopted collective
    farming under the influence of theoretical
    convictions&#8221; (p. 50).</p>

    <p>Never as yet and nowhere has a literary swindle been
    perpetrated equal to that to which Kautsky has stooped. He quotes
    &#8220;theses&#8221;, but says nothing about the <em>law</em> of
    the Soviet government. He talks about &#8220;theoretical
    convictions&#8221;, but says nothing about the proletarian state
    power which holds in its hands the factories and goods! All that
    Kautsky the Marxist wrote in 1899 in his <em>Agrarian
    Question</em> about the means at the disposal of the proletarian
    state for bringing about the gradual transition of the small
    peasants to socialism has been forgotten by Kautsky the renegade
    in 1918.</p>

    <p>Of course, a few hundred state-supported agricultural communes
    and state farms (i.e., large farms cultivated by associations of
    workers at the expense of the state) are very little, but can
    Kautsky&#8217;s ignoring of this fact be called
    &#8220;criticism&#8221;?</p>

    <p>The nationalisation of the land that has been effected in
    Russia by the proletarian dictatorship has best ensured the
    carrying of the bourgeois-democratic revolution to its
    conclusion&#8212;even in the event of a victory of the
    counter-revolution causing a reversion from land nationalisation
    to land division (I made a special examination of this possibility
    in my pamphlet on the agrarian programme of the Marxists in the
    1905 Revolution). In addition, the nationalisation of the land has
    given the proletarian state the maximum opportunity of passing to
    socialism in agriculture.</p>

    <p>To sum up, Kautsky has presented us, as far as theory is
    concerned, with an incredible hodge-podge which is a complete
    renunciation of Marxism, and, as far as practice is concerned,
    with a policy of servility to the bourgeoisie and their
    reformism. A fine criticism indeed!</p>

    <center>* &#160; &#160; *</center>
    <center>*</center>

    <p>Kautsky begins his &#8220;economic analysis&#8221; of industry
    with the following magnificent argument:</p>

    <p>Russia has a large-scale capitalist industry. Cannot a
    socialist system of production be built up on this foundation?
    &#8220;One might think so if socialism meant that the workers of
    the separate factories and mines made these their property&#8221;
    (literally appropriated these for themselves) &#8220;in order to
    carry on production separately at each factory&#8221; (p. 52),
    &#8220;This very day, August 5, as I am writing these
    lines,&#8221; Kautsky adds, &#8220;a speech is reported from
    Moscow delivered by Lenin on August 2, in which he is stated to
    have declared: &#8216;The workers are holding the factories firmly
    in their hands, and the peasants will not return the land to the
    landowners.&#8217; Up till now, the slogan: the factories to the
    workers, and the land to the peasants, has been an
    anarcho-syndicalist slogan, not a Social-Democratic one&#8221;
    (pp. 52&ndash;53).</p>

    <p>I have quoted this passage in full so that the Russian workers,
    who formerly respected Kautsky, and quite rightly, might see for
    themselves the methods employed by this deserter to the bourgeois
    camp.</p>

    <p>Just think: on August 5, when numerous decrees on the
    nationalisation of factories in Russia had been issued&#8212;and
    not a single factory had been &#8220;appropriated&#8221; by the
    workers, but had <em>all</em> been converted into the property of
    the Republic&#8212;on August 5, Kautsky, on the strength of an
    obviously crooked interpretation of one sentence in my speech,
    tries to make the German readers believe that in Russia the
    factories are being turned over to individual groups of workers!
    And after that Kautsky, at great length, chews the cud about it
    being wrong to turn over factories to individual groups of
    workers!</p>

    <p>This is not criticism, it is the trick of a lackey of the
    bourgeoisie, whom the capitalists have hired to slander the
    workers&#8217; revolution.</p>

    <p>The factories must be turned over to the state, or to the
    municipalities, or the consumers&#8217; co-operative societies,
    says Kautsky over and over again, and finally adds:</p>

    <p>&#8220;This is what they are now trying to do in Russia. . . .&#8221; 
    Now! What does that mean? In August? Why,
    could not Kautsky have commissioned his friends Stein or Axelrod,
    or any of the other friends of the Russian bourgeoisie, to
    translate at least one of the decrees on the factories?</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;How far they have gone in this direction,
    we cannot yet tell. At all events, this aspect of the activity of
    the Soviet Republic is of the greatest interest to us, but it
    still remains entirely shrouded in darkness. There is no lack of
    decrees. . . .&#8221; (That is why Kautsky ignores their <em>content</em>, or
    conceals it from his readers!) &#8220;But there is no reliable
    information as to the effect of these decrees. Socialist
    production is impossible without all-round, detailed, reliable and
    rapidly informative statistics. The Soviet Republic cannot
    possibly have created such statistics yet. What we learn about its
    economic activities is highly contradictory and can in no way
    be verified. This, too, is a result of the dictatorship and the
    suppression of democracy. There is no freedom of the press, or of
    speech&#8221; (p. 53).</p>

    <p>This is how history is written! From a &#8220;free&#8221; press
    of the capitalists and Dutov men Kautsky would have received
    information about factories being taken over by the workers. . . .
    This &#8220;serious savant&#8221; who stands above classes is
    magnificent, indeed! About the countless facts which show that the
    factories are being turned over to the Republic <em>only</em>, that they
    are managed by an organ of Soviet power, the Supreme Economic
    Council, which is constituted mainly of workers elected by the
    trade unions, Kautsky refuses to say a single word. With the
    obstinacy of the &#8220;man in the muffler&#8221;, he stubbornly
    keeps repeating one thing: give me peaceful democracy, without
    civil war, without a dictatorship and with good statistics (the
    Soviet Republic has created a statistical service in which the
    best statistical experts in Russia are employed, but, of course,
    ideal statistics cannot be obtained so quickly). In a word, what
    Kautsky demands is a revolution without revolution, without fierce
    struggle, without violence. It is equivalent to asking for strikes
    in which workers and employers do not get excited. Try to find the
    difference between this kind of &#8220;socialist&#8221; and common
    liberal bureaucrat!</p>

    <p>So, relying upon such &#8220;factual material&#8221;, i.e.,
    deliberately and contemptuously ignoring the innumerable facts,
    Kautsky &#8220;concludes&#8221;:</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;It is doubtful whether the Russian
    proletariat has obtained more in the sense of real practical
    gains, and not of mere decrees, under the Soviet Republic than it
    would have obtained from a Constituent Assembly, in which, as in
    the Soviets, socialists, although of a different hue,
    predominated&#8221; (p. 58).</p>

    <p>A gem, is it not? We would advise Kautsky&#8217;s admirers to
    circulate this utterance as widely as possible among the Russian
    workers, for Kautsky could not have provided better material for
    gauging the depth of his political degradation. Comrade workers,
    Kerensky, too, was a &#8220;socialist&#8221;, only of a
    &#8220;different hue&#8221;! Kautsky the historian is satisfied
    with the name, the title which the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries
    and the Mensheviks &#8220;appropriated&#8221; to
    themselves. Kautsky the historian refuses even to listen to the
    facts which show that under Kerensky the Mensheviks and the Right
    Socialist-Revolutionaries supported the imperialist policy and
    marauding practices of the bourgeoisie: he is discreetly silent
    about the fact that the majority in the Constituent Assembly
    consisted of these very champions of imperialist war and bourgeois
    dictatorship. And this is called &#8220;economic
    analysis&#8221;!</p>

    <p class="quote">In conclusion let me quote another sample of this
    &#8220;economic analysis&#8221;:</p>

    <p>&#8220;. . . After nine months&#8217; existence, the Soviet
    Republic, instead of spreading general well-being, felt itself
    obliged to explain why there is general want&#8221; (p. 41).</p>

    <p>We are accustomed to hear such arguments from the lips of the
    Cadets. All the flunkeys of the bourgeoisie in Russia argue in
    this way: show us, after nine months, your general well-being&#8212;and
    this after four years of devastating war, with foreign capital
    giving all-round support to the sabotage and rebellions of the
    bourgeoisie in Russia. <em>Actually</em>, there has remained absolutely no
    difference whatever, not a shadow of difference, between Kautsky
    and a counter-revolutionary bourgeois. His honeyed talk, cloaked in
    the guise of &#8220;socialism&#8221;, only repeats what the
    Kornilov men, the Dutov men and Krasnov men in Russia say bluntly,
    straightforwardly and without embellishment.</p>

    <p>The above lines were written on November 9, 1918. That same
    night news was received from Germany announcing the beginning of a
    victorious revolution, first in Kiel and other northern towns and
    ports, where power has passed into the hands of Councils of
    Workers&#8217; and Soldiers&#8217; Deputies, then in Berlin,
    where, too, power has passed into the hands of a Council.</p>

    <p>The conclusion which still remained to be written to my
    pamphlet on Kautsky and on the proletarian revolution is now
    superfluous.</p>

    Two new parties&#8212;Narodnik Communists and Revolutionary
    Communists&#8212;separated from the Left Socialist-Revolutionary
    Party after the provocative assassination by Left
    Socialist-Revolutionaries of the German Ambassador, Count Mirbach,
    and their revolt on July 6&ndash;7, 1918.</p>

    <p class="endnote">The <em>Narodnik Communists</em> condemned the
    anti-Soviet activity of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and
    formed their own party at a conference in September 1918.
    Their programme &#8220;Manifesto&#8221; was published in the newspaper
    <em>Znamya Trudovoi Kommuny</em> (<em>The Banner of the Labour
    Commune</em>) on August 21. They approved the Bolshevik course for
    an alliance with the middle peasants. Many of the Narodnik
    Communists were members of Soviet bodies and some of them, for
    example G. D. Zaks, sat on the All-Russia Central Executive
    Committee. On November 6, 1918, at its extraordinary
    congress the party decided to dissolve and merge with the Russian
    Communist Party (Bolsheviks).</p>

    <p class="endnote"><em>The Party of Revolutionary Communism</em>
    was founded at a congress of the newspaper <em>Volya Truda</em>
    (<em>Freedom of Labour</em>) supporters held in Moscow, September
    25&ndash;30, 1918. The first issue of the paper appeared on
    September 14, carrying a policy statement for the coming congress,
    whose authors denounced terrorist acts by the Left
    Socialist-Revolutionaries and their attempts to torpedo the
    Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty. The Inaugural Congress of the party
    went on record for co-operation with Soviet power. The programme
    of the &#8220;Revolutionary Communists&#8221; was very contradictory. 
    While recognising that the Soviets created the prerequisites for the establishment 
    of socialism, it denied the necessity
    of the dictatorship of the proletariat during the transition from
    capitalism to socialism. After the Second Congress of the
    Communist International had adopted a decision that there must be
    only one Communist Party in every country, the Party of
    Revolutionary Communism decided in September 1920 to
    affiliate to the R.C.P.(B.). In October of the same year the
    Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) allowed Party organisations to
    admit into their ranks former members of the Party of
    Revolutionary Communism.</p>

    The treachery of M. A. Muravyov, Commander of Soviet troops on the
    Eastern Front, was closely connected with the revolt of Left
    Socialist-Revolutionaries in July 1918. According to the plans of
    the mutineers, Muravyov was to raise a revolt against Soviet power
    and, joining forces with the whiteguard Czechs, to march on
    Moscow. On July 10 Muravyov arrived in Simbirsk and stated he did
    not recognise the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty and declared war on
    Germany. The misguided troops occupied the Post, Telegraph and
    Radio Station and surrounded the building of the Executive
    Committee and the staff of the Simbirsk army group. Muravyov sent
    wireless messages calling on the whiteguards and interventionists
    between Samara and Vladivostok to march on Moscow.</p>

    <p class="endnote">The Soviet Government took urgent measures to
    defeat Muravyov&#8217;s venture. The Communists of Simbirsk
    carried out extensive explanatory work among the garrison troops
    and the townsmen. The army units which had formerly supported
    Muravyov now declared they were ready to fight him. On the night
    of July 11 Muravyov was summoned to the meeting of the Simbirsk
    Executive Committee. He interpreted this as the Executive
    Committee&#8217;s surrender. When his treacherous messages about
    the cessation of hostilities against interventionists and
    whiteguards were read at the meeting, the Communists demanded his
    arrest. Muravyov resisted and was shot; his associates were
    arrested.</p>

    By the July crisis, Lenin means kulak counter-revolutionary
    revolts in the central gubernias, in the Volga area, the Urals and
    Siberia in the summer of 1918, which were organised by Mensheviks
    and Socialist-Revolutionaries with the assistance of foreign
    interventionists.</p>

    <em>Blanquism</em>&#8212;a trend in the French socialist movement
    led by the prominent revolutionary and exponent of French utopian
    communism, Louis Auguste Blanqui (1805&ndash;1881). Lenin wrote about
    Blanquism: &#8220;Blanquism expects that mankind will be emancipated
    from wage-slavery, not by the proletarian class struggle, but
    through a conspiracy hatched by a small minority of intellectuals&#8221;
    (<em>Collected Works</em>, Vol. 10, p. 392). In substituting the actions of
    a secret group of conspirators for the activity of a revolutionary
    party the Blanquists lost sight of the real conditions necessary
    for a victorious uprising and ignored contacts with the people.</p>

    This refers to the Socialist-Revolutionary bill submitted by the
    Minister for Agriculture S. L. Maslov to the Provisional
    Government a few days before the October Revolution. It was called
    &#8220;Rules for the Regulation by Land Committees of Land and
    Agricultural Relations&#8221; and was published in part in the
    newspaper <em>Dyelo Naroda</em> (<em>People&#8217;s Cause</em>), organ of
    the Cental Committee of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, on
    October 18 (31), 1917.</p>

    <p class="endnote">&#8220;This bill of Maslov&#8217;s,&#8221;
    Lenin wrote, &#8220;is downright betrayal of the peasants by the
    S.R. Party, and signifies its complete subservience to the landed
    proprietors&#8221; (<em>Collected Works</em>, Vol. 26,
    p. 228). The bill set up a special rent fund in the Land
    Committees, to which state-owned and monastery lands were to be
    transferred. Landed proprietorship was left intact. Landowners
    were to turn over to the fund only the land they previously used
    to rent out and the peasants were to pay the rent for the &#8220;rented&#8221;
    land to the landowners.</p>

    <p class="endnote">The Provisional Government arrested members of
    the Land Committees in retribution for peasant revolts and
    seizures of landed estates.</p>
