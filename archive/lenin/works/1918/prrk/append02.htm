    <h4>Vandervelde&#8217;s New Book On The State</h4>

    <p class="fst">It was only after I had read Kautsky&#8217;s book
    that I had the opportunity to acquaint myself with
    Vandervelde&#8217;s <em>Socialism versus the State</em> (Paris,
    1918). A comparison of the two books involuntarily suggests
    itself. Kautsky is the ideological leader of the Second
    International (1889&ndash;1914), while Vandervelde, in his capacity of
    Chairman of the <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/i/n.htm#international-socialist-bureau">International
    Socialist Bureau,</a> is its official representative. Both
    represent the complete bankruptcy of the Second International, and
    both with the dexterity of experienced journalists
    &#8220;skilfully&#8221; mask this bankruptcy and their own
    bankruptcy and desertion to the bourgeoisie with Marxist
    catchwords. One gives us a striking example of what is typical of
    German opportunism, ponderous, theorising and grossly falsifying
    Marxism by trimming it of all that is unacceptable to the
    bourgeoisie. The other is typical of the Latin&#8212;to a certain
    extent, one may say, of the West-European (that is, west of
    Germany)&#8212;variety of prevailing opportunism, which is more
    flexible, less ponderous, and which falsifies Marxism by the same
    fundamental method, but in a more subtle manner.</p>

    <p>Both radically distort Marx&#8217;s teaching on the state as
    well as his teaching on the dictatorship of the proletariat;
    Vandervelde deals more with the former subject, Kautsky with the
    latter. Both obscure the very close and inseparable connection
    that exists between the two subjects. Both are revolutionaries and
    Marxists in word, but renegades in practice, who strain every
    effort to <em>dissociate themselves</em> from revolution. Neither
    of them has anything that permeates the works of Marx and Engels,
    and that actually distinguishes socialism from a bourgeois
    caricature of it, namely, the elucidation of the tasks of
    revolution as <em>distinct</em> from the tasks of reform, the
    elucidation of revolutionary tactics as distinct from reformist
    tactics, the elucidation of the role of the proletariat in the
    <em>abolition</em> of the system, order or regime of wage-slavery
    as distinct from the role of the proletariat of the
    &#8220;Great&#8221; Powers which shares with the bourgeoisie a
    particle of the latter&#8217;s imperialist superprofits and
    superbooty.</p>

    <p>We shall quote a few of Vandervelde&#8217;s most important
    arguments in support of this opinion.</p>

    <p>Like Kautsky, Vandervelde quotes Marx and Engels with great
    zeal, and like Kautsky, he quotes from Marx and Engels anything
    you like <em>except</em> what is absolutely unacceptable to the
    bourgeoisie and what distinguishes a revolutionary from a
    reformist. He speaks volubly about the conquest of political power
    by the proletariat, since practice has already confined this
    within strictly parliamentary limits. But as regards the fact that
    after the experience of the Paris Commune, Marx and Engels found
    it necessary to supplement the partially obsolete <em>Communist
    Manifesto</em> with an elucidation of the truth that the working
    class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery,
    but must <em>smash</em> it&#8212;<em>not a single word</em> has he to
    say about that! Vandervelde and Kautsky, as if by agreement, pass
    over in complete silence what is most essential in the
    <em>experience</em> of the proletarian revolution, precisely that
    which distinguishes proletarian revolution from bourgeois
    reforms.</p>

    <p>Like Kautsky, Vandervelde talks about the dictatorship of the
    proletariat only to dissociate himself from it. Kautsky did it by
    gross falsifications. Vandervelde does it in a more subtle way. In
    the part of his book, Section 4, on the subject of the
    &#8220;conquest of political power by the proletariat&#8221;, he
    devotes sub-section <em>b</em> to the question of the
    &#8220;collective dictatorship of the proletariat&#8221;,
    &#8220;quotes&#8221; Marx and Engels (I repeat: omitting precisely
    what pertains to the main point, namely, the <em>smashing</em> of
    the old, bourgeois-democratic state machine), and concludes:</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;. . . In socialist circles, the social
    revolution is commonly conceived in the following manner: a new
    Commune, this time victorious, and not in one place but in the
    main centres of the capitalist world.</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;A hypothesis, but a hypothesis which has
    nothing improbable about it at a time when it is becoming evident
    that the post-war period will see in many countries unprecedented
    class antagonisms and social convulsions.</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;But if the failure of the Paris Commune,
    not to speak of the difficulties of the Russian revolution, proves
    anything at all, it proves that it is impossible to put an end to
    the capitalist system until the proletariat has sufficiently
    prepared itself to make proper use of the power the force of
    circumstances may place into its hands&#8221; (p. 73).</p>

    <p>And absolutely nothing more on the point at issue!</p>

    <p>Here they are, the leaders and representatives of the Second
    International! In 1912 they signed the Basle Manifesto, which
    explicitly speaks of the connection between that very war which
    broke out in 1914 and a proletarian revolution, and actually holds
    it up as a <em>threat.</em> And when the war broke out and a
    revolutionary situation arose, the Kautskys and Vanderveldes began
    to dissociate themselves from revolution. A revolution of the
    Paris Commune type is only a not improbable hypothesis! This is
    quite analogous to Kautsky&#8217;s argument about the possible
    role of the Soviets in Europe.</p>

    <p>But that is just the way every educated <em>liberal</em>
    argues; he will, no doubt, agree now that a new Commune is
    &#8220;not improbable&#8221;, that the Soviets have a great role
    to play, etc. The proletarian revolutionary differs from the
    liberal precisely in that he, as a theoretician, analyses the new
    significance of the Commune and the Soviets <em>as a state.</em>
    Vandervelde, however, <em>passes over in silence</em> everything
    Marx and Engels said at such length on the subject when analysing
    the experience of the Paris Commune.</p>

    <p>As a practical worker, as a politician, a Marxist should have
    made it clear that only traitors to socialism can now evade the
    task of elucidating the need for a proletarian revolution (of the
    Commune type, the Soviet type, or perhaps of some third type), of
    explaining the necessity of preparing for it, of conducting
    propaganda for revolution among the people, of refuting the
    petty-bourgeois prejudices against it, etc.</p>

    <p>But neither Kautsky nor Vandervelde does anything of the sort,
    precisely because they themselves are traitors to socialism, who
    want to maintain their reputation as socialists and Marxists among
    the workers.</p>

    <p>Take the theoretical formulation of the question.</p>

    <p>The state, even in a democratic republic, is nothing but a
    machine for the suppression of one class by another. Kautsky is
    familiar with this truth, admits it, agrees with it, but . . .  he
    evades the fundamental question as to what particular class the
    proletariat must suppress when it establishes the proletarian
    state, for what reasons, and by what means.</p>

    <p>Vandervelde is familiar with, admits, agrees with and quotes
    this fundamental proposition of Marxism (p. 72 of his book), but
    . . . he does not say a single word on the &#8220;unpleasant&#8221;
    (for the capitalist gentlemen) subject of the suppression of the
    resistance of the exploiters!</p>

    <p>Both Vandervelde and Kautsky have completely evaded this
    &#8220;unpleasant&#8221; subject.  Therein lies their
    apostasy.</p>

    <p>Like Kautsky, Vandervelde is a past master in the art of
    substituting eclecticism for dialectics. On the one hand it cannot
    but be admitted, and on the other hand it must be confessed. On
    the one hand, the term state may mean &#8220;the nation as a
    whole&#8221; (see Littr&#233;s dictionary&#8212;a learned work, it
    cannot be denied&#8212;and Vandervelde, p. 87); on the other hand, the
    term state may mean the &#8220;government&#8221;
    (ibid.). Vandervelde quotes this learned platitude, with approval,
    <em>side by side</em> with quotations from Marx.</p>

    <p>The Marxist meaning of the word &#8220;state&#8221; differs
    from the ordinary meaning, writes Vandervelde. Hence,
    &#8220;misunderstandings&#8221; may arise. &#8220;Marx and Engels
    regard the state not as the state in the broad sense, not as an
    organ of guidance, as the representative of the general interests
    of society (<em>int&#233;r&#234;ts g&#233;n&#233;raux de la
    soci&#233;t&#233;</em>). It is the state as the power, the state as the organ of
    authority, the state as the instrument of the rule of one class
    over another&#8221; (pp.  75&ndash;76 of Vandervelde&#8217;s book).</p>

    <p>Marx and Engels speak about the abolition of the state only in
    its second meaning. . . .  &#8220;Too absolute affirmations run the
    risk of being inexact. There are many transitional stages between
    the capitalist state, which is based on the exclusive rule of one
    class, and the proletarian state, the aim of which is to abolish
    all classes&#8221; (p. 156).</p>

    <p>There you have an example of Vandervelde&#8217;s
    &#8220;manner&#8221;, which is only slightly different from that
    of Kautsky&#8217;s, and, in essence, identical with it.
    Dialectics repudiate absolute truths and explain the successive
    changes of opposites and the significance of crises in
    history. The eclectic does not want propositions that are
    &#8220;too absolute&#8221;, because he wants to push forward his
    philistine desire to substitute &#8220;<em>transitional
    stages</em>&#8221; for revolution.</p>

    <p>The Kautskys and Vanderveldes say nothing about the fact that
    the transitional stage between the state as an organ of the rule
    of the capitalist class and the state as an organ of the rule of
    the proletariat is <em>revolution</em>, which means
    <em>overthrowing</em> the bourgeoisie and <em>breaking up</em>,
    smashing, <em>their</em> state machine.</p>

    <p>The Kautskys and Vanderveldes obscure the fact that the
    dictatorship of the bourgeoisie must be replaced by the
    dictatorship of <em>one</em> class, the proletariat, and that the
    &#8220;transitional stages&#8221; of the <em>revolution</em> will
    be followed by the &#8220;transitional stages&#8221; of the
    gradual withering away of the proletarian state.</p>

    <p>Therein lies their political apostasy.</p>

    <p>Therein, theoretically, philosophically, lies their
    substitution of eclecticism and sophistry for
    dialectics. Dialectics are concrete and revolutionary and
    distinguish between the &#8220;transition&#8221; from the
    dictatorship of one class to the dictatorship of another and
    &#8220;transition&#8221; from the democratic proletarian state to
    the non-state (&#8220;the withering away of the state&#8221;). To
    please the bourgeoisie, the eclecticism and sophistry of the
    Kautskys and Vanderveldes blur all that is concrete and precise in
    the class struggle and advance instead the general concept
    &#8220;transition&#8221;, under which they may hide (as
    <em>nine-tenths</em> of the official <em>Social-Democrats</em> of our
    time <em>do hide</em>) their renunciation of revolution!</p>

    <p>As an eclectic and sophist, Vandervelde is more skilful and
    subtle than Kautsky; for the <em>phrase</em>, &#8220;transition
    from the state in the narrow sense to the state in the broad
    sense&#8221;, can serve as a means of evading all and sundry
    problems of revolution, all the difference between revolution and
    reform, and even the difference between the Marxist and the
    liberal. For what bourgeois with European education would think of
    denying, &#8220;in general&#8221;, &#8220;transitional
    stages&#8221; in this &#8220;general&#8221; sense?</p>

    <p>Vandervelde writes:</p>

    <p>&#8220;I agree with Guesde that it is impossible to socialise
    the means of production and exchange without the following two
    conditions having been fulfilled:</p>

    <p>&#8220;1. The transformation of the present state as the organ
    of the rule of one class over another into what Monger calls a
    people&#8217;s labour state, by the conquest of political power by
    the proletariat.</p>

    <p>&#8220;2. Separation of the state as an organ of authority from
    the state as an organ of guidance, or, to use Saint-Simon&#8217;s
    expression, of the government of men from the administration of
    things&#8221; (p. 89).</p>

    <p>Vandervelde puts this in italics, laying special emphasis on
    the importance of these propositions. But this is a sheer
    eclectical hodge-podge, a complete rupture with Marxism!  The
    &#8220;people&#8217;s labour state&#8221; is just a paraphrase of
    the old &#8220;free people&#8217;s state&#8221;, which the German
    Social-Democrats paraded in the seventies and which Engels branded
    as an absurdity.<a id="bk42" href="#fw42" name="bk42"><sup
    class="enote">[42]</sup></a> The term &#8220;people&#8217;s labour
    state&#8221; is a phrase worthy of petty-bourgeois democrats (like
    our Left Socialist-Revolutionaries), a phrase which substitutes
    <em>non-class</em> concepts for class concepts. Vandervelde places
    the conquest of state power by the <em>proletariat</em> (by one
    <em>class</em>) alongside of the &#8220;people&#8217;s&#8221;
    state, and fails to see that the result is a hodge-podge. With
    Kautsky and his &#8220;pure democracy&#8221;, the result is a
    similar hodge-podge, and a similar anti-revolutionary, philistine
    disregard of the tasks of the class revolution, of the class,
    proletarian, dictatorship, of the <em>class</em> (proletarian) state.</p>

    <p>Further, the government of men will disappear and give way to
    the administration of things only when the state <em>in all
    forms</em> withers away. But talking about this relatively distant
    future, Vandervelde overlays, obscures the task of
    <em>tomorrow</em>, namely, the <em>overthrow</em> of the
    bourgeoisie.</p>

    <p>This trick is also equivalent to subserviency to the liberal
    bourgeoisie. The liberal is willing to talk about what will happen
    when it is not necessary to govern men. Why not indulge in such
    innocuous dreams? But about the proletariat having to crush the
    bourgeoisie&#8217;s resistance to their expropriation&#8212;not a
    word. The class interests of the bourgeoisie demand it.</p>

    <p><em>Socialism versus the State.</em> This is
    Vandervelde&#8217;s bow to the proletariat.  It is not difficult
    to make a bow; every &#8220;democratic&#8221; politician knows how
    to make a how to his electors. And under cover of a
    &#8220;&#8217;bow&#8221;, an anti-revolutionary, anti-proletarian
    meaning is insinuated.</p>

    <p>Vandervelde extensively paraphrases 
      Ostrogorsky<a id="bk43"
		    href="#fw43" name="bk43"><sup class="enote">[43]</sup></a>
      to show what amount of deceit, violence, corruption, mendacity, hypocrisy
      and oppression of the poor is hidden beneath the civilised,
      polished and perfumed exterior of modern bourgeois democracy. But
      he draws no conclusion from this. He fails to notice that
      bourgeois democracy suppresses the working and exploited people
      and that <em>proletarian democracy</em> will have to <em>suppress
	the bourgeoisie</em>. Kautsky and Vandervelde are blind to
      this. The class interests of the bourgeoisie, in whose wake these
      petty-bourgeois traitors to Marxism are floundering,
      <em>demand</em> that this question be evaded, that it be hushed
      up, or that the necessity of such suppression be directly
      denied.</p>

    <p>Petty-bourgeois eclecticism versus Marxism, sophistry versus
      dialectics, philistine reformism versus proletarian
      revolution&#8212;that should have been the title of Vandervelde&#8217;s
      book.

      Lenin refers to the book by M. Ostrogorsky, <em>La Democratie et
	les Partis Politiques</em>,which was first published in Paris in
      1903. The Russian edition of the first volume appeared in 1927 and
      the second volume in 1930. The book contains rich factual material
      on the history of Britain and the U.S.A., which exposes the
      falsehood and hypocrisy of bourgeois democracy.</p>
