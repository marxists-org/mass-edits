    <h3>The Constituent Assembly And The Soviet Republic</h3>

    <p>The question of the Constituent Assembly and its dispersal by
    the Bolsheviks is the crux of Kautsky&#8217;s entire pamphlet. He
    constantly reverts to it, and the whole of this literary
    production of the ideological leader of the Second International
    is replete with innuendoes to the effect that the Bolsheviks have
    &#8220;destroyed democracy&#8221; (see one of the quotations from
    Kautsky above). The question is really an interesting and
    important one, because the relation between bourgeois democracy
    and proletarian democracy here confronted the revolution in a
    <em>practical</em> form. Let us see how our &#8220;Marxist
    theoretician&#8221; has dealt with the question.</p>

    <p>He quotes the &#8220;Theses on the Constituent Assembly&#8221;,
    written by me and published in <em>Pravda</em> on December 26,
    1917. One would think that no better evidence of Kautsky&#8217;s
    serious approach to the subject, quoting as he does the documents,
    could be desired. But look how he quotes. He does not say that
    there were nineteen of these theses; he does not say that they
    dealt with the relation between the ordinary bourgeois republic
    with a Constituent Assembly and a Soviet republic, as well as with
    the <em>history</em> of the divergence in our revolution between
    the Constituent Assembly and the dictatorship of the
    proletariat. Kautsky ignores all that, and simply tells the reader
    that &#8220;two of them&#8221; (of the theses) &#8220;are
    particularly important&#8221;: one stating that a split occurred
    among the Socialist-Revolutionaries after the elections to the
    Constituent Assembly, but before it was convened (Kautsky does not
    mention that this was the fifth thesis), and the other, that the
    republic of Soviets is in general a higher democratic form than
    the Constituent Assembly (Kautsky does not mention that this was
    the third thesis).</p>

    <p>Only from this third thesis does Kautsky quote a part in full,
    namely, the following passage:</p>

    <p>&#8220;The republic of Soviets is not only a higher type of
    democratic institution (as compared with the <em>usual</em>
    bourgeois republic crowned by a Constituent Assembly), but is the
    only form capable of securing the most painless<a id="bk19"
    href="#fw19" name="bk19"><sup class="enote">[19]</sup></a>
    transition to socialism&#8221; (Kautsky omits the word
    &#8220;usual&#8221; and the introductory words of the thesis:
    &#8220;For the transition from the bourgeois to the socialist
    system, for the dictatorship of the proletariat&#8221;).</p>

    <p>After quoting these words, Kautsky, with magnificent irony,
    exclaims:</p>

    <p>&#8220;It is a pity that this conclusion was arrived at only
    after the Bolsheviks found themselves in the minority in the
    Constituent Assembly. Before that no one had demanded it more
    vociferously than Lenin.&#8221;</p>

    <p>This is literally what Kautsky says on page 31 of his book!</p>

    <p>It is positively a gem! Only a sycophant of the bourgeoisie
    could present the question in such a false way as to give the
    reader the impression that all the Bolsheviks&#8217; talk about a
    higher type of state was an invention which saw light of day
    <em>after</em> they found themselves in the minority in the
    Constituent Assembly! Such an infamous lie could only have been
    uttered by a scoundrel who has sold himself to the bourgeoisie,
    or, what is absolutely the same thing, who has placed his trust in
    Axelrod and is concealing the source of his information.</p>

    <p>For everyone knows that on the very day of my arrival in
    Russia, on April 4, 1917, I publicly read my theses in which I
    proclaimed the superiority of the Paris Commune type of state over
    the bourgeois parliamentary republic. Afterwards I
    <em>repeatedly</em> stated this in print, as, for instance, in a
    pamphlet on political parties, which was translated into English
    and was published in January 1918 in the New York <em>Evening
    Post</em>.<a id="bk20" href="#fw20" name="bk20"><sup
    class="enote">[20]</sup></a> More than that, the Conference
    of the Bolshevik Party held at the end of April 1917 adopted a
    resolution to the effect that a proletarian and peasant republic
    was superior to a bourgeois parliamentary republic, that our Party
    would not be satisfied with the latter, and that the Party
    Programme should be modified accordingly.</p>

    <p>In face of these facts, what name can be given to
    Kautsky&#8217;s trick of assuring his German readers that I had
    been vigorously demanding the convocation of the Constituent
    Assembly, and that I began to &#8220;belittle&#8221; the honour
    and dignity of the Constituent Assembly only after the Bolsheviks
    found themselves in the minority in it? How can one excuse such a
    trick? <span class="inote">[Incidentally, there are many Menshevik
    lies of this kind in Kautsky&#8217;s pamphlet! It is a lampoon
    written by an embittered Menshevik.&#8212;<em>Lenin</em>]</span>
    By pleading that Kautsky did not know the facts? If that is the
    case, why did he undertake to write about them? Or why did he not
    honestly announce that he was writing on the strength of
    information supplied by the Mensheviks Stein and Axelrod and Co.?
    By pretending to be objective, Kautsky wants to conceal his role
    as the servant of the Mensheviks, who are disgruntled because they
    have been defeated.</p>

    <p>This, however, is a mere trifle compared with what is to
    come.</p>

    <p>Let us assume that Kautsky would not or could not (?) obtain
    from his informants a translation of the Bolshevik resolutions and
    declarations on the question of whether the Bolsheviks would be
    satisfied with a bourgeois parliamentary democratic republic or
    not. Let us assume this, although it is incredible. But Kautsky
    <em>directly mentions</em> my theses of December 26, 1917, on page
    30 of his book.</p>

    <p>Does he not know these theses in full, or does he know only
    what was translated for him by the Steins, the Axelrods and Co.?
    Kautsky quotes the <em>third</em> thesis on the <em>fundamental</em>
    question of whether the Bolsheviks, before the elections to
    the Constituent Assembly, realised that a Soviet republic is
    superior to a bourgeois republic, and whether they told the
    <em>people</em> that. <em>But he keeps silent about the second
    thesis.</em></p>

    <p>The second thesis reads as follows:</p>

    <p>&#8220;While demanding the convocation of a Constituent
    Assembly, revolutionary Social-Democracy has ever since the
    beginning of the revolution of 1917 <em>repeatedly emphasised
    that a republic of Soviets is a higher form of democracy
    than the usual bourgeois republic with a Constituent Assembly</em>.

    (my italics).</p>

    <p>In order to represent the Bolsheviks as unprincipled people, as
    &#8220;revolutionary opportunists&#8221; (this is a term which
    Kautsky employs somewhere in his book, I forget in which
    connection), Mr. Kautsky <em>has concealed from his German
    readers</em> the fact that the theses contain a direct
    reference to &#8220;<em>repeated</em>&#8221; declarations!</p>

    <p>These are the petty, miserable and contemptible methods
    Mr. Kautsky employs! That is the way he has evaded the
    <em>theoretical</em> question.</p>

    <p>Is it true or not that the bourgeois-democratic parliamentary
    republic is <em>inferior to</em> the republic of the Paris Commune
    or Soviet type? This is the whole point, and Kautsky has evaded
    it. Kautsky has &#8220;forgotten&#8221; all that Marx said in his
    analysis of the Paris Commune. He has also &#8220;forgotten&#8221;
    Engels&#8217;s letter to Bebel of March 28, 1875, in which this
    same idea of Marx is formulated in a particularly lucid and
    comprehensible fashion: &#8220;The Commune was no longer a state
    in the proper sense of the word.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Here is the most prominent theoretician of the Second

      International, in a special pamphlet on <em>The Dictatorship of
	the Proletariat</em>, specially dealing with Russia, where the
      question of a form of state that is higher than a democratic
      bourgeois republic has been raised directly and repeatedly,
      ignoring this very question. In what way does this differ <em>in
	fact</em> from desertion to the bourgeois camp?</p>

    <p>(Let us observe in parenthesis that in this respect, too,
    Kautsky is merely trailing after the Russian Mensheviks. Among the
    latter there are any number of people who know &#8220;all the
    quotations&#8221; from Marx and Engels. Yet not a single
    Menshevik, from April to October 1917 and from October 1917 to
    October 1918, has <em>ever</em> made a <em>single</em> attempt to
    examine the question of the Paris Commune type of
    state. Plekhanov, too, has evaded the question. <em>Evidently he
    had to</em>.)</p>

    <p>It goes without saying that to discuss the dispersal of the
    Constituent Assembly<a id="bk21" href="#fw21" name="bk21"><sup
    class="enote">[21]</sup></a> with people who call themselves
    socialists and Marxists, but who in fact desert to the bourgeoisie
    on the <em>main</em> question, the question of the Paris Commune
    type of state, would be casting pearls before swine. It will be
    sufficient to give the complete text of my theses on the
    Constituent Assembly as an appendix to the present book. The
    reader will then see that the question was presented on December
    26, 1917, in the light of theory, history and practical
    politics.</p>

    <p>If Kautsky has completely renounced Marxism as a theoretician
    he might at least have examined the question of the struggle of
    the Soviets with the Constituent Assembly as a historian. We know
    from many of Kautsky&#8217;s works that he <em>knew how to</em> he
    a Marxist historian, and that <em>such</em> works of his will remain a
    permanent possession of the proletariat in spite of his subsequent
    apostasy. But on this question Kausky, even as a historian,
    <em>turns his back</em> on the truth, ignores <em>well-known</em>
    facts and behaves like a sycophant. He <em>wants</em> to represent
    the Bolsheviks as being unprincipled and he tells his readers that
    they tried to <em>mitigate</em> the conflict with the Constituent
    Assembly before dispersing it. There is absolutely nothing wrong
    about it, we have nothing to recant; I give the theses in full and
    there it is said as clear as clear can be: Gentlemen of the
    vacillating petty bourgeoisie entrenched in the Constituent
    Assembly, either reconcile yourselves to the proletarian
    dictatorship, or else we shall defeat you by &#8220;revolutionary
    means&#8221; (theses 18 and 19).</p>

    <p>That is how a really revolutionary proletariat has always
    behaved and always will behave towards the vacillating petty
    bourgeoisie.</p>

    <p>Kautsky adopts a formal standpoint on the question of the
    Constituent Assembly. My theses say clearly and repeatedly that
    the interests of the revolution are higher than the formal rights
    of the Constituent Assembly (see theses 16 and 17). The formal
    democratic point of view is precisely the point of view of the
    <em>bourgeois</em> democrat who refuses to admit that the
    interests of the proletariat and of the proletarian class struggle
    are supreme. As a historian, Kautsky would not have been able to
    deny that bourgeois parliaments are the organs of this or that
    class. But now (for the sordid purpose of renouncing revolution)
    Kautsky finds it necessary to forget his Marxism, and he
    <em>refrains from putting the question</em>: the organ of what
    <em>class</em> was the Constituent Assembly of Russia? Kautsky
    does not examine the concrete conditions; he does not want to face
    facts; he does not say a single word to his German readers about
    the fact that the theses contained not only a theoretical
    elucidation of the question of the limited character of bourgeois
    democracy (theses 1-3), not only a description of the concrete
    conditions which determined the discrepancy between the party
    lists of candidates in the middle of October 1917 and the real
    state of affairs in December 1917 (theses 4-6), but also <em>a
    history of the class struggle and the Civil War</em> in
    October&ndash;December 1917 (theses 7&#150;15). From this concrete history we
    drew the conclusion (thesis 14) that the slogan &#8220;All Power
    to the Constituent Assembly!&#8221; had, <em>in reality</em>,
    become the slogan of the Cadets and the Kaledin men and their
    abettors.</p>

    <p>Kautsky the historian fails to see this. Kautsky the historian
    has never heard that universal suffrage sometimes produces
    petty-bourgeois, sometimes reactionary and counter-revolutionary
    parliaments. Kautsky the Marxist historian has never heard that
    the form of elections, the form of democracy, is one thing, and
    the class content of the given institution is another. This
    question of the class content of the Constituent Assembly is
    directly put and answered in my theses. Perhaps my answer is
    wrong. Nothing would have been more welcome to us than a Marxist
    criticism of our analysis by an outsider. Instead of writing
    utterly silly phrases (of which there are plenty in
    Kautsky&#8217;s book) about somebody preventing criticism of
    Bolshevism, he ought to have set out to make such a criticism. But
    the point is that he offers no criticism. He does not even
    <em>raise the question</em> of a class analysis of the Soviets on
    the one hand, and of the Constituent Assembly on the other. It is
    therefore <em>impossible</em> to argue, to debate with
    Kautsky. All we can do is <em>demonstrate</em> to the reader why
    Kautsky cannot be called anything else but a renegade.</p>

    <p>The divergence between the Soviets and the Constituent Assembly
    has its history, which even a historian who does not share the
    point of view of the class struggle could not have
    ignored. Kautsky would not <em>touch</em> upon this actual
    history. Kautsky has concealed from his German readers the
    universally known fact (which only malignant Mensheviks now
    conceal) that the divergence between the Soviets and the
    &#8220;general state&#8221; (that is, bourgeois) institutions
    existed even under the rule of the Mensheviks, i.e., from the end
    of February to October 1917. Actually, Kautsky adopts the position
    of conciliation, compromise and collaboration between the
    proletariat and the bourgeoisie. However much Kautsky may
    repudiate this, it is a fact which is borne out by his whole
    pamphlet. To say that the Constituent Assembly should not have
    been dispersed is tantamount to saying that the fight against the
    bourgeoisie should not have been fought to a finish, that the
    bourgeoisie should not have been overthrown and that the
    proletariat should have made peace with them.</p>

    <p>Why has Kautsky kept quiet about the fact that the Mensheviks
    were engaged in this inglorious work between February and October
    1917 and did not achieve anything? If it was possible to reconcile
    the bourgeoisie with the proletariat, why didn&#8217;t the
    Mensheviks succeed in doing so? Why did the bourgeoisie stand
    aloof from the Soviets? Why did the <em>Mensheviks</em> call the
    Soviets &#8220;revolutionary democracy&#8221;, and the bourgeoisie
    the &#8220;propertied elements&#8221;?</p>

    <p>Kautsky has concealed from his German readers that it was the
    Mensheviks who, in the &#8220;epoch&#8221; of their rule (February
    to October 1917), called the Soviets &#8220;revolutionary
    democracy&#8221;, <em>thereby</em> admitting their superiority
    over all other institutions. It is only by concealing this fact
    that Kautsky the historian made it appear that the divergence
    between the Soviets and the bourgeoisie had no history, that it
    arose instantaneously, without cause, suddenly, because of the bad
    behaviour of the Bolsheviks. Yet, in actual fact, it was <em>the
    more than six months&#8217;</em> (an enormous period in time of
    revolution) <em>experience</em> of Menshevik compromise, of their
    attempts to reconcile the proletariat with the bourgeoisie, that
    convinced the people of the fruitlessness of these attempts and
    drove the proletariat away from the Mensheviks.</p>

    <p>Kautsky admits that the Soviets are an excellent combat
    organisation of the proletariat, and that they have a great future
    before them. But, that being the case, Kautsky&#8217;s position
    collapses like a house of cards, or like the dreams of a petty
    bourgeois that the acute struggle between the proletariat and the
    bourgeoisie can be avoided. For revolution is one continuous and
    moreover desperate struggle, and the proletariat is the vanguard
    class of <em>all</em> the oppressed, the focus and centre of all
    the aspirations of all the oppressed for their emancipation!
    Naturally, therefore, the Soviets, as the organ of the struggle of
    the oppressed people, reflected and expressed the moods and
    changes of opinions of these people ever so much more quickly,
    fully, and faithfully than any other institution (that,
    incidentally, is one of the reasons why Soviet democracy is the
    highest type of democracy).</p>

    <p>In the period between February 28 (old style) and October 25,
    1917, the Soviets managed to convene <em>two</em> all-Russia
    congresses of representatives of the overwhelming majority of the
    population of Russia, of all the workers and soldiers, and of 70
    or 80 per cent of the peasants, not to mention the vast number of
    local, uyezd, town, gubernia, and regional
    congresses. During this period the bourgeoisie did not succeed in
    convening a single institution representing the majority (except
    that obvious sham and mockery called the &#8220;Democratic
    Conference&#8221; ,<a id="bk22" href="#fw22" name="bk22"><sup
    class="enote">[22]</sup></a> which enraged the proletariat). The
    Constituent Assembly reflected <em>the same</em> popular mood and <em>the
    same</em> political grouping as the First (June) All-Russia
    Congress of Soviets. By the time the Constituent Assembly was
    convened (January 1918), the Second (October 1917) and Third
    (January 1918) Congresses of Soviets had met, both of which had
    <em>demonstrated as clear as clear could be</em> that the people
    had swung to the left, had become revolutionised, had turned away
    from the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, and had
    passed over to the side of the Bolsheviks; <em>that is,</em> had
    turned away from petty-bourgeois leadership, from the illusion
    that it was possible to reach a compromise with the bourgeoisie,
    and had joined the proletarian revolutionary struggle for the
    overthrow of the bourgeoisie.</p>

    <p>So, even the <em>external history</em> of the Soviets shows
    that the Constituent Assembly was a <em>reactionary</em> body and
    that its dispersal was inevitable. But Kautsky sticks firmly to
    his &#8220;slogan&#8221;: let &#8220;pure democracy&#8221; prevail
    though the revolution perish and the bourgeoisie triumph over the
    proletariat! <em>Fiat justitia, pereat mundus</em>! <span
    class="inote">[Latin for &#8220;Let justice be done, even though
    the world may perish&#8221;.<em>&#8212;Editor</em>.]</span></p>

    <p>Here are the brief figures relating to the all-Russia
    congresses of Soviets in the course of the history of the Russian
    revolution:</p>

    <p>One glance at these figures is enough to understand why the
    defence of the Constituent Assembly and talk (like
    Kautsky&#8217;s) about the Bolsheviks not having a majority of the
    population behind them are just ridiculed in Russia</p>

    Incidentally, Kautsky, obviously trying to be ironical, repeatedly
    quotes the expression &#8220;most painless&#8221; transition; but
    as the shaft misses its mark, a few pages farther on he commits a
    slight forgery and falsely quotes it as a &#8220;painless&#8221;
    transition! Of course, by such means it is easy to put any
    absurdity into the mouth of an opponent. The forgery also helps
    him to evade the substance of the argument, namely, that the most
    painless transition to socialism is possible only when all the
    poor are organised to a man (Soviets) and when the core of state
    power (the proletariat) helps them to organise.</p>

    Lenin&#8217;s pamphlet <em>Political Parties in Russia and

    Evening Post</em> on January 15, 1918, and by <em>The Class
    Struggle</em>, the organ of the Left wing of the American
    Socialist Party, in issue No. 4 for November&ndash;December 1917. It
    also appeared as a separate edition.</p>

    <p class="endnote">The <em>Evening Post</em>&#8212;a bourgeois newspaper
    published in New York from 1801 (from 1801 to 1832 it was called
    <em>The New York Evening Post</em>). For a number of years it
    followed a liberal policy. After the October Socialist Revolution
    it published the secret treaties concluded between the Allies and
    the tsarist government. Subsequently it became the mouthpiece of
    the most reactionary imperialist circles. It now appears as <em>The

    On June 14 (27), 1917, the Provisional Government decided to hold
    elections to the Constituent Assembly on September 17 (30),
    1917. In August it postponed the elections until November 12
    (25).</p>

    <p class="endnote">Elections to the Constituent Assembly took
    place on the appointed date, November 12 (25), after the October
    Socialist Revolution. Deputies were elected according to the lists
    that had been drawn up before the Revolution and in keeping with
    the regulations endorsed by the Provisional Government. Elections
    took place at a time when the mass of the people had not yet
    appreciated the import of the October Revolution. This put the
    Right Socialist-Revolutionaries at an advantage and as a result
    they secured a majority of votes in areas outside the capital and
    industrial centres. The Constituent Assembly met in Petrograd on
    January 5 (18), 1918. By decree of the All-Russia Central
    Executive Committee on January 6 (19), 1918, the Constituent
    Assembly was dissolved because, through the reactionary majority,
    it had rejected the Declaration of Rights of the Working and
    Exploited People submitted by the All-Russia Central Executive
    Committee and had refused to approve the decrees of the Second
    Congress of Soviets on peace, land and the transfer of power to
    the Soviets.</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw22" href="#bk22" name="fw22">[22]</a>
    The All-Russia Democratic Conference was called by the
    Menshevik/Socialist-Revolutionary Central Executive Committee of
    Soviets to decide the question of power and met in Petrograd
    in September 1917. Actually, however, it was called in order to
    divert people&#8217;s attention from the mounting revolution. More
    than 1,500 delegates attended. The Menshevik and
    Socialist-Revolutionary leaders took all steps to reduce
    representation of the Soviets of Workers&#8217; and
    Peasants&#8217; Deputies and increase the number of delegates from
    various petty-bourgeois and bourgeois organisations, thereby
    securing a majority for themselves. Thus, increased representation
    was granted to municipalities, which sent 300 delegates; Zemstvos
    sent 200 delegates and the co-operatives, which were under the
    control of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, sent 120
    delegates. But the Soviets of Workers&#8217; and Soldiers&#8217;
    Deputies, which represented the overwhelming majority of the
    population, had only 230 delegates. The Bolsheviks took part in
    the Conference for the purpose of utilising it as a platform for
    exposing the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries.</p>

  <p class="endnote">The Conference adopted a decision to establish a
    Pre-Parliament (Provisional Council of the Republic). This was an
    attempt to create a semblance of a parliamentary system in
    Russia. According to the regulations worked out by the Provisional
    Government, the Pre-Parliament was to be an advisory government
    body. Lenin emphatically insisted on boycotting the
    Pre-Parliament, as to stay in it would have created the impression
    it could solve the tasks of the revolution. The Central Committee
    of the Party discussed Lenin&#8217;s proposal and decided that
    Bolsheviks should resign their seats in the Pre-Parliament. Only
    Kamenev and other capitulators insisted on participating. At the
    opening session of the Pre-Parliament on October 7 (20) the
    Bolsheviks road their declaration and walked out.</p>
