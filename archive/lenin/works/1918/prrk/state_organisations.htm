    <h1>The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky </h1>

    <hr />

    <h3>The Soviets Dare Not Become State Organisations</h3>

    <p>The Soviets are the Russian form of the proletarian
    dictatorship. If a Marxist theoretician, writing a work on the
    dictatorship of the proletariat, had really studied the subject
    (and not merely repeated the petty-bourgeois lamentations against
    dictatorship, as Kautsky did, singing to Menshevik tunes), he
    would first have given a general definition of dictatorship, and
    would then have examined its peculiar, national, form, the
    Soviets; he would have given his critique of them as one of the
    forms of the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>

    <p>It goes without saying that nothing serious could be expected
    from Kautsky after his liberalistic &#8220;interpretation&#8221;
    of Marx&#8217;s teaching on dictatorship; but the manner in which
    he approached the question of what the Soviets are and the way he
    dealt with this question is highly characteristic.</p>

    <p>The Soviets, he says, recalling their rise in 1905, created
    &#8220;the most all-embracing (<em>umfassendste</em>) form of
    proletarian organisation, for it embraced all the
    wage-workers&#8221; (p. 31). In 1905 they were only local bodies;
    in 1917 they became a national organisation.</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;The Soviet form of organisation,&#8221;
    Kautsky continues, &#8220;already has a great and glorious history
    behind it, and it has a still mightier future before it, and not
    in Russia alone. It appears that everywhere the old methods of the
    economic and political struggle of the proletariat are
    inadequate&#8221; (<em>versa gen</em>; this German expression is
    somewhat stronger than &#8220;inadequate&#8221; and somewhat
    weaker than &#8220;impotent&#8221;) &#8220;against the gigantic
    economic and political forces which finance capital has at its
    disposal. These old methods cannot be discarded; they are still
    indispensable for normal times; but from time to time tasks arise
    which they cannot cope with, tasks that can be accomplished
    successfully only as a result of a combination of all the
    political and economic instruments of force of the working
    class&#8221; (p. 32).</p>

    <p>Then follows a reasoning on the mass strike and on &#8220;trade
    union bureaucracy&#8221;&#8212;which is no less necessary than
    the trade unions&#8212;being &#8220;useless for the purpose of
    directing the mighty mass battles that are more and more becoming
    a sign of the times. . . .&#8221;</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;Thus,&#8221; Kautsky concludes, &#8220;the
    Soviet form of organisation is one of the most important phenomena
    of our time. It promises to acquire decisive importance in the
    great decisive battles between capital and labour towards which we
    are marching.</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;But are we entitled to demand more of the
    Soviets? The Bolsheviks, after the November Revolution&#8221; (new
    style, or October, according to our style) &#8220;1917, secured in
    conjunction with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries a majority in
    the Russian Soviets of Workers&#8217; Deputies, and after the
    dispersion of the Constituent Assembly, they set out to transform
    the Soviets from a <em>combat organisation</em> of one
    <em>class,</em> as they had been up to then, into a <em>state
    organisation.</em> They destroyed the democracy which the Russian
    people had won in the March&#8221; (new style, or February, our
    style) &#8220;Revolution. In line with this, the Bolsheviks have
    ceased to call themselves Social-<em>Democrats</em>. They call themselves
    <em>Communists</em>&#8221; (p. 33, Kautsky&#8217;s italics).</p>

    <p>Those who are familiar with Russian Menshevik literature will
    at once see how slavishly Kautsky copies Martov, Axelrod, Stein
    and Co. Yes, &#8220;slavishly&#8221;, because Kautsky ridiculously
    distorts the facts in order to pander to Menshevik
    prejudices. Kautsky did not take the trouble, for instance, to ask
    his informants (Stein of Berlin, or Axelrod of Stockholm)
    <em>when</em> the questions of changing the name of the Bolsheviks
    to Communists and of the significance of the Soviets as state
    organisations were first raised. Had Kautsky made this simple
    inquiry he would not have penned these ludicrous lines, for both
    these questions were raised by the Bolsheviks <em>in April
    1917</em>, for example, in my &#8220;Theses&#8221; of April 4,
    1917, i.e., <em>long before</em> the Revolution of October 1917
    (and, of course, long before the dissolution of the Constituent
    Assembly on January 5, 1918).</p>

    <p>But Kautsky&#8217;s argument which I have just quoted in full
    represents the <em>crux</em> of the whole question of the
    Soviets. The crux is: should the Soviets aspire to become state
    organisations (in April 1917 the Bolsheviks put forward the
    slogan: &#8220;All Power to the Soviets!&#8221; and at the
    Bolshevik Party Conference held in the same month they declared
    they were not satisfied with a bourgeois parliamentary republic
    but demanded a workers&#8217; and peasants&#8217; republic of the
    Paris Commune or Soviet type); <em>or</em> should the Soviets not
    strive for this, refrain from taking power into their hands,
    refrain from becoming state organisations and remain the
    &#8220;combat organisations&#8221; of one &#8220;class&#8221; (as
    Martov expressed it, embellishing by this innocent wish the fact
    that under Menshevik leadership the Soviets were <em>an instrument
    for the subjection of the workers to the bourgeoisie</em>)</p>

    <p>Kautsky slavishly repeats Martov&#8217;s words, picks out
    <em>fragments</em> of the theoretical controversy between the
    Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, and uncritically and senselessly
    transplants them to the general theoretical and general European
    field. The result is such a hodge-podge as to provoke Homeric
    laughter in every class-conscious Russian worker had he read these
    arguments of Kautsky&#8217;s.</p>

    <p>When we explain what the question at issue is, every worker in
    Europe (barring a handful of inveterate social-imperialists) will
    greet Kautsky with similar laughter.</p>

    <p>Kautsky has rendered Martov a backhanded service by developing
    his mistake into a glaring absurdity. Indeed, look what
    Kautsky&#8217;s argument amounts to.</p>

    <p>The Soviets embrace all wage-workers. The old methods of
    economic and political struggle of the proletariat are inadequate
    against finance capital. The Soviets have a great role to play in
    the future, and not only in Russia. They will play a decisive role
    in great decisive battles between capital and labour in
    Europe. That is what Kautsky says.</p>

    <p>Excellent. But won&#8217;t the &#8220;decisive battles between
    capital and labour&#8221; decide which of the two classes will
    assume state power?</p>

    <p>Nothing of the kind! Heaven forbid!</p>

    <p>The Soviets, which embrace all the wage-workers, <em>must not
    become state organisations</em> in the &#8220;decisive&#8221;
    battles!</p>

    <p>But what is the state?</p>

    <p>The state is nothing but a machine for the suppression of one
    class by another.</p>

    <p>Thus, the oppressed class, the vanguard of all the working and
    exploited people in modern society, must strive towards the
    &#8220;decisive battles between capital and labour&#8221;, <em>but
    must not touch</em> the machine by means of which capital
    suppresses labour!&#8212;<em>It must not break up</em> that
    machine! <em>It must not make use</em> of its all-embracing
    organisation <em>for suppressing the exploiters</em>!</p>

    <p>Excellent, Mr. Kautsky, magnificent! &#8220;We&#8221; recognise
    the class struggle&#8212;in the same way as all liberals recognise
    it, i.e., without the overthrow of the bourgeoisie. . . .</p>

    <p>This is where Kautsky&#8217;s complete rupture both with
    Marxism and with socialism becomes obvious. Actually, it is
    desertion to the camp of the bourgeoisie, who are prepared to
    concede everything except the transformation of the organisations
    of the class which they oppress into state organisations. Kautsky
    can no longer save his position of trying to reconcile everything
    and of getting away from all profound contradictions with mere
    phrases.</p>

    <p>Kautsky either rejects the assumption of state power by the
    working class altogether, or he concedes that the working class
    may take over the old, bourgeois state machine. But he will by no
    means concede that it must break it up, smash it, and replace it
    by a new, proletarian machine. Whichever way Kautsky&#8217;s
    arguments are &#8220;interpreted&#8221;, or
    &#8220;explained&#8221;, his rupture with Marxism and his
    desertion to the bourgeoisie are obvious.</p>

    <p>Back in the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>, describing what sort
    of state the victorious working class needs, Marx wrote:
    &#8220;the state, i.e., the proletariat organised as the ruling
    class.&#8221;<a id="bk17" href="#fw17" name="bk17"><sup
    class="enote">[17]</sup></a> Now we have a man who claims still to
    be a Marxist coming forward and declaring that the proletariat,
    fully organised and waging the &#8220;decisive battle&#8221;
    against capital, <em>must not</em> transform its class
    organisation into a state organisation. Here Kautsky has betrayed
    that &#8220;superstitious belief in the state&#8221; which in
    Germany, as Engels wrote in 1891, &#8220;has been carried over
    into the general thinking of the bourgeoisie and even of many
    workers&#8221;.<a id="bk18" href="#fw18" name="bk18"><sup
    class="enote">[18]</sup></a> Workers, fight!&#8212;our philistine
    &#8220;agrees&#8221; to this (as every bourgeois
    &#8220;agrees&#8221;, since the workers are fighting all the same,
    and the only thing to do is to devise means of blunting the edge
    of their sword)&#8212;fight, but <em>don&#8217;t dare win</em>!
    Don&#8217;t destroy the state machine of the bourgeoisie,
    don&#8217;t replace the bourgeois &#8220;state organisation&#8221;
    by the proletarian &#8220;state organisation&#8221;!</p>

    <p>Whoever sincerely shared the Marxist view that the state is
    nothing but a machine for the suppression of one class by another,
    and who has at all reflected upon this truth, could never have
    reached the absurd conclusion that the proletarian organisations
    capable of defeating finance capital must not transform themselves
    into state organisations. It was this point that betrayed the
    petty bourgeois who believes that &#8220;after all is said and
    done&#8221; the state is something outside classes or above
    classes. Indeed, why should the proletariat, &#8220;<em>one
    class</em>&#8221;, be permitted to wage unremitting war on
    <em>capital</em>, which rules not only over the proletariat, but
    over the whole people, over the whole petty bourgeoisie, over all
    the peasants, yet this proletariat, this &#8220;<em>one
    class</em>&#8221;, is not to be permitted to transform its
    organisation into a state organisation? Because the petty
    bourgeois is <em>afraid</em> of the class struggle, and does not
    carry it to its logical conclusion, <em>to its main
    object</em>.</p>

    <p>Kautsky has got himself completely mixed up and has given
      himself away entirely. Mark you, he himself admits that Europe is
      heading for decisive battles between capital and labour, and that
      the old methods of economic and political struggle of the
      proletariat are inadequate. But these old methods were precisely
      the utilisation of <em>bourgeois</em> democracy. It therefore
	follows . . .?

    </p>
    <p>
      But Kautsky is afraid to think of what
      follows.</p>

    <p>. . . It therefore follows that only a reactionary, an enemy of the
      working class, a henchman of the bourgeoisie, can now turn his
      face to the obsolete past, paint the charms of bourgeois democracy
      and babble about pure democracy. Bourgeois democracy <em>was</em>
      progressive compared with medievalism, and it had to be
      utilised. But now it is <em>not sufficient</em> for the working
	class. Now we must look forward instead of backward&#8212;to
	replacing the bourgeois democracy by <em>proletarian</em>
      democracy. And while the preparatory work for the proletarian
      revolution, the formation and training of the proletarian army
      were possible (and necessary) <em>within the framework</em> of the
      bourgeois-democratic state, now that we have reached the stage of
      &#8220;decisive battles&#8221;, to confine the proletariat to this
      framework means betraying the cause of the proletariat, means
      being a renegade.</p>

    <p>Kautsky has made himself particularly ridiculous by repeating
    Martov&#8217;s argument <em>without noticing</em> that in
    Martov&#8217;s case this argument was based on <em>another</em>
    argument which he, Kautsky, does not use! Martov said (and Kautsky
    repeats after him) that Russia is not yet ripe for socialism; from
    which it logically follows that it is too early to transform the
    Soviets from organs of struggle into state organisations (read: it
    is timely to transform the Soviets, with the assistance of the
    Menshevik leaders, into instruments for <em>subjecting</em> the
    workers to the imperialist bourgeoisie). Kautsky, however,
    <em>cannot</em> say outright that Europe is not ripe for
    socialism. In 1909, when he was not yet a renegade, he wrote that
    there was then no reason to fear a <em>premature</em> revolution, that
    whoever had renounced revolution for fear of defeat would have
    been a traitor. Kautsky does not dare renounce this <em>outright</em>.
    And so we get an absurdity, which completely reveals the stupidity
    and cowardice of the petty bourgeois: on the one hand, Europe is
    ripe for socialism and is heading towards decisive battles between
    capital and labour; but, on the other hand, the <em>combat
    organisation</em> (i.e., the organisation which arises, grows and
    gains strength in combat), the organisation of the proletariat,
    the vanguard and organiser, the leader of the oppressed,
    <em>must</em> not be transformed into a state organisation!</p>

    <center>* &#160; &#160; *</center>
    <center>*</center>

    <p>From the point of view of practical politics the idea that the
      Soviets are necessary as combat organisations but must not be
      transformed into state organisations is infinitely more absurd
      than from the point of view of theory. Even in peacetime, when
      there is no revolutionary situation, the mass struggle of the
      workers against the capitalists&#8212;for instance, the mass
      strike&#8212;gives rise to great bitterness on both sides, to
      fierce passions in the struggle, the bourgeoisie constantly
      insisting that they remain and mean to remain &#8220;masters in
      their own house&#8221;, etc. And in time of revolution, when
      political life reaches boiling point, an organisation like the
      Soviets, which embraces <em>all</em> the workers in <em>all</em>
      branches of industry, <em>all</em> the soldiers, and all the working
      and poorest sections of the rural population&#8212;such an
      organisation, of its own accord, with the development of the
      struggle, by the simple &#8220;logic&#8221; of attack and
      defence, comes inevitably to pose the question
      <em>point-blank</em>. The attempt to take up a middle position
      and to &#8220;reconcile&#8221; the proletariat with the
      bourgeoisie is sheer stupidity and doomed to miserable
      failure. That is what happened in Russia to the preachings of
      Martov and other Mensheviks, and that will inevitably happen in
      Germany and other countries if the Soviets succeed in developing
      on any wide scale, manage to unite and strengthen. To say to the
      Soviets: fight, but don&#8217;t take all state power into your
      hands, don&#8217;t become state organisations&#8212;is
      tantamount to preaching class collaboration and &#8220;social
      peace&#8221; between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. It is
      ridiculous even to think that such a position in the midst of
      fierce struggle could lead to anything but ignominious
      failure. But it is Kautsky&#8217;s everlasting fate to sit
      between two stools. He pretends to disagree with the
      opportunists on everything in theory, but <em>in practice</em> he
      agrees with them on everything essential (i.e., on everything
      pertaining to revolution).
