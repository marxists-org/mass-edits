    <h3>Preface</h3>

    <p class="fst">
      Kautsky&#8217;s pamphlet, <em><a href="../../../../kautsky/1918/dictprole/index.htm">The Dictatorship of the
      Proletariat</a></em>, recently published in Vienna (Wien, 1918,
      Ignaz Brand, pp. 63) is a most lucid example of that utter and
      ignominious bankruptcy of the Second International about which
      all honest socialists in all countries have been talking for a
      long time. The proletarian revolution is now becoming a
      practical issue in a number of countries, and an examination of
      Kautsky&#8217;s renegade sophistries and his complete
      renunciation of Marxism is therefore essential.</p>

    <p>First of all, it should be emphasised, however, that the
    present author has, from the very beginning of the war, repeatedly
    pointed to Kautsky&#8217;s rupture with Marxism. A number of
    articles published between 1914 and 1916 in <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/periodicals/s/o.htm#sotsial-demokrat"><em>Sotsial-Demokrat</em></a>
    and <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/periodicals/k/o.htm#kommunist"><em>Kommunist</em></a>,
    issued abroad, dealt with this subject. These articles were
    afterwards collected and published by the Petrograd Soviet under
    the title <em>Against the Stream</em>, by G. Zinoviev and N. Lenin
    (Petrograd, 1918, pp. 550). In a pamphlet published in Geneva in
    1915 and translated at the same time into German and French<a
    id="bk02" href="#fw02" name="bk02"><sup
    class="enote">[2]</sup></a> I wrote about &#8220;Kautskyism&#8221;
    as follows:</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kautsky, the leading authority in the Second
    International, is a most typical and striking example of how a
    verbal recognition of Marxism has led in practice to its
    conversion into &#8216;Struvism&#8217;, or into
    &#8216;Brentanoism&#8217; [i.e., into a bourgeois-liberal theory
    recognising the non-revolutionary &#8220;class&#8221; struggle of
    the proletariat, which was expressed most clearly by Struve, the
    Russian writer, and Brentano, the German economist]. Another
    example is Plekhanov. By means of patent sophistry, Marxism is
    stripped of its revolutionary living spirit; <em>everything
    </em> is recognised in Marxism <em>except</em> the revolutionary methods of
    struggle, the propaganda and preparation of those methods, and the
    education of the masses in this direction. Kautsky reconciles in
    an unprincipled way the fundamental idea of social-chauvinism,
    recognition of defence of the fatherland in the present war, with
    a diplomatic sham concession to the Lefts&#8212;his abstention
    from voting for war credits, his verbal claim to be in the
    opposition, etc. Kautsky, who in 1909 wrote a book on the
    approaching epoch of revolutions and on the connection between war
    and revolution, Kautsky, who in 1912 signed the <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/terms/b/a.htm#basle-manifesto-1912">Basle
    Manifesto</a>  on taking revolutionary advantage of the impending
    war, is outdoing himself in justifying and embellishing
    social-chauvinism and, like Plekhanov, joins the bourgeoisie in
    ridiculing any thought of revolution and all steps towards the
    immediate revolutionary struggle.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The working class cannot play its world-revolutionary
    role unless it wages a ruthless struggle against this backsliding,
    spinelessness, subservience to opportunism, and unparalleled
    vulgarisation of the theories of Marxism. Kautskyism is not
    fortuitous; it is the social product of the contradictions within
    the <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/s/o.htm#socialist-international">Second
    International</a>, a blend of loyalty to Marxism in word and
    subordination to opportunism in deed&#8221; (G. Zinoviev and
    N. Lenin, <em>Socialism and War</em>, Geneva, 1915,
    pp. 13&ndash;14).</p>

    <p>Again, in my book <em><a
    href="../../1916/imp-hsc/index.htm">Imperialism, the Latest
    Stage of Capitalism</a>,</em><span class="inote">[This was the
    original title of Lenin&#8217;s <em>Imperialism, the Highest Stage of
    Capitalism</em>.]</span> written in 1916 and published in Petrograd in
    1917, I examined in detail the theoretical fallacy of all
    Kautsky&#8217;s arguments about imperialism. I quoted
    Kautsky&#8217;s definition of imperialism: &#8220;Imperialism is a
    product of highly developed industrial capitalism. It consists in
    the striving of every industrial capitalist nation to bring under
    its control or to annex all large areas of <em>agrarian</em>
    [Kautsky&#8217;s italics] territory, irrespective of what nations
    inhabit it.&#8221; I showed how utterly incorrect this definition
    was, and how it was &#8220;adapted&#8221; to the glossing over of
    the most profound contradictions of imperialism, and then to
    reconciliation with opportunism. I gave my own definition of
    imperialism: &#8220;Imperialism is capitalism at that stage of
    development at which the dominance of monopolies and finance
    capital is established; at which the export of capital has
    acquired pronounced importance; at which the division of the
    world among the international trusts has begun; at which the
    division of all territories of the globe among the biggest
    capitalist powers has been completed.&#8221; I showed that
    Kautsky&#8217;s critique of imperialism is on an even lower plane
    than the bourgeois, philistine critique.</p>

    <p>Finally, in August and September 1917&#8212;that is, before the
    proletarian revolution in Russia (October 25 [November 7], 1917),
    I wrote a pamphlet (published in Petrograd at the beginning of
    1918) entitled <em>The State and Revolution. The Marxist Theory of
    the State and the Tasks of the Proletariat in the Revolution</em>.
    In Chapter VI of this book, entitled &#8220;The Vulgarisation of
    Marxism by the Opportunists&#8221;, I devoted special attention to
    Kautsky, showing that he had completely distorted Marx&#8217;s
    ideas, tailoring them to suit opportunism, and that he had
    &#8220;repudiated the revolution in deeds, while accepting it in
    words.&#8221;</p>

    <p>In substance, the chief theoretical mistake Kautsky makes in
    his pamphlet on the dictatorship of the proletariat lies in those
    opportunist distortions of Marx&#8217;s ideas on the state&#8212;the
    distortions which I exposed in detail in my pamphlet, <em>The
    State and Revolution.</em></p>

    <p>These preliminary remarks were necessary for they show that I
    openly accused Kautsky of being a renegade <em>long before</em>
    the Bolsheviks assumed state power and were condemned by him on
    that account.</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw01" href="#bk01" name="fw01">[1]</a>
      Lenin began work on the book <em>The Proletarian Revolution and the
      Renegade Kautsky</em> at the beginning of October 1918, immediately
      after he had read Kautsky&#8217;s <em>The Dictatorship of the
      Proletariat</em>, which distorted and vulgarised the Marxist theory of
      the proletarian revolution and slandered the Soviet state.</p>
    
    <p class="endnote">
      Lenin attached great importance to exposure of Kautsky&#8217;s
      opportunist views on the socialist revolution and the
      dictatorship of the proletariat. In August 1918 the magazine
      <em>Sozialistische Auslandspotilih</em> carried Kautsky&#8217;s article
      in which he called upon the Social-Democratic parties to fight
      the Bolsheviks. After reading excerpts from the article
      published in <em>Pravda</em> on September 20, Lenin wrote to
      V. V. Vorovsky in Stockholm:  &#8220;The disgraceful nonsense,
      childish twaddle and most vulgar opportunism of Kautsky warrant
      the question: Why are we doing nothing to combat Kautsky&#8217;s
      <em>theoretical</em> vulgarisation of Marxism?&#8221;  (<em>Collected Works</em>,
      Vol. 35).</p>

    <p class="endnote">Lenin asked Vorovsky, the then plenipotentiary
      envoy of the Soviet Republic in the Scandinavian countries, to
      send him Kautsky&#8217;s pamphlet on the dictatorship as soon as
      it was out and also all his articles about the Bolsheviks.</p>
    
    <p class="endnote">Bonch-Bruyevich wrote in his reminiscences that
      Lenin was carried away by his work on <em>The Proletarian Revolution
      and the Renegade Kautsky</em>,  &#8220;he was literally burning with
      anger&#8221;,  &#8220;sitting up <em>every</em> day till late at night writing
      this remarkably hard hitting work. . . .&#8221;  On October 9,
      before the book&#8217;s completion Lenin wrote an article under
      the same title, which appeared in <em>Pravda</em> on October 11. On October
      10 he sent a note to People&#8217;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs
      U. V. Chicherin and his deputy L. M. Karakhan asking them to
      forward his article to A. A. Joffe, Y. A. Berzin and
      V. V. Vorovsky in Berlin. In the accompanying letter he wrote:
      &#8220;Dear comrades, I realise only too well the defects of this
      very short article against Kautsky. But it is essential to make a
      stand <em>as quickly as possible</em> and express an opinion. Please see
      that it is translated and published in leaflet form&#8221;  (<em>Lenin
      Miscellany XXXVI</em>, pp. 61&ndash;62). The German translation of
      Lenin&#8217;s article was published in Berne in 1918 and in Vienna
      in 1919. In 1919 it was also published in Milan in Italian.</p>

    <p class="endnote">In 1919 Lenin&#8217;s pamphlet <em>The Proletarian
      Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky</em> was published in Britain,
      France and Germany.</p>
   
    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw02" href="#bk02" name="fw02">[2]</a>
      Reference is to the pamphlet <em>Socialism and War</em> (<em>The Attitude
	of the R.S.D.L.P. Towards the War</em>). Lenin decided to write
      it in connection with the First International Socialist Conference
      that was about to be convened. He wrote it together with Zinoviev,
      but the main part of the pamphlet belongs to Lenin who also edited
      it.</p>
   
    <p class="endnote">The pamphlet was published in Russian and
      German and circulated among the delegates at the Zimmerwald
      Conference which met in September 1915. After the Conference it
      was also published in France, and in Norway in the Left
      Social-Democratic newspaper. Lenin more than once tried, though
      without success, to get it published in America in English.	 </p>
