    <h3>Can There Be Equality Between the Exploited and the Exploiter?</h3>

    <p class="fst">Kautsky argues as follows:</p>

    <p class="quote">(1) &#8220;The exploiters have always formed only
    a small minority of the population&#8221; (p. 14 of
    Kautsky&#8217;s pamphlet).</p>

    <p>This is indisputably true. Taking this as the starting point,
    what should be the argument? One may argue in a Marxist, a
    socialist way. In which case one would proceed from the relation
    between the exploited and the exploiters. Or one may argue in a
    liberal, a bourgeois-democratic way. And in that case one would
    proceed from the relation between the majority and the
    minority.</p>

    <p>If we argue in a Marxist way, we must say: the exploiters
    inevitably transform the state (and we are speaking of democracy,
    i.e., one of the forms of the state) into an instrument of the
    rule of their class, the exploiters, over the exploited. Hence, as
    long as there are exploiters who rule the majority, the exploited,
    the democratic state must inevitably be a democracy for the
    exploiters. A state of the exploited must fundamentally differ
    from such a state; it must be a democracy for the exploited,
    &#8220;and a means of <em>suppressing the exploiters</em>; and the
    suppression of a class means inequality for that class, its
    exclusion from &#8220;democracy&#8221;.</p>

    <p>If we argue in a liberal way, we must say: the majority
    decides, the minority submits. Those who do not submit are
    punished. That is all. Nothing need be said about the class
    character of the state in general, or of &#8220;pure
    democracy&#8221; in particular, because it is irrelevant; for a
    majority is a majority and a minority is a minority. A pound of
    flesh is a pound of flesh, and that is all there is to it.</p>

    <p>And this is exactly how Kautsky argues.</p>

    <p class="quote">(2) &#8220;Why should the rule of the proletariat
    assume, and necessarily assume, a form which is incompatible with
    democracy?&#8221; (P. 21). Then follows a very detailed and a very
    verbose explanation, backed by a quotation from Marx and the
    election figures of the Paris Commune, to the effect that the
    proletariat is in the majority. The conclusion is: &#8220;A regime
    which is so strongly rooted in the people has not the slightest
    reason for encroaching upon democracy. It cannot always dispense
    with violence in cases when violence is employed to suppress
    democracy. Violence can only be met with violence. But a regime
    which knows that it has popular backing will employ violence only
    to <em>protect</em> democracy and not to <em>destroy</em> it. It
    would be simply suicidal if it attempted to do away with its most
    reliable basis&#8212;universal suffrage, that deep source of
    mighty moral authority&#8221; (p. 22).</p>

    <p>As you see, the relation between the exploited and the
    exploiters has vanished in Kautsky&#8217;s argument. All that
    remains is majority in general, minority in general, democracy in
    general, the &#8220;pure democracy&#8221; with which we are
    already familiar.</p>

    <p>And all this, mark you, is said <em>apropos of the Paris
    Commune</em>! To make things clearer I shall quote Marx and Engels
    to show what they said on the subject of dictatorship <em>apropos of
    the Paris Commune</em>:</p>

    <p><em>Marx</em>: &#8220;. . . When the workers replace the
    dictatorship of the bourgeoisie by their revolutionary
    dictatorship . . . to break down the resistance of the bourgeoisie
    . . . the workers invest the state with a revolutionary and
    transitional form . . .&#8221;<a id="bk14" href="#fw14" name="bk14"><sup
    class="enote">[14]</sup></a></p>

    <p><em>Engels</em>: &#8220;. . . And the victorious party&#8221;
    (in a revolution) &#8220;must maintain its rule by means of the
    terror which its arms inspire in the reactionaries. Would the
    Paris Commune have lasted more than a day if it had not used the
    authority of the armed people against the bourgeoisie? Cannot we,
    on the contrary, blame it for having made too little use of that
    authority? . . .&#8221;<a id="bk15" href="#fw15" name="bk15"><sup
    class="enote">[15]</sup></a></p>

    <p><em>Engels</em>: &#8220;As, therefore, the state is only a
    transitional institution which is used in the struggle, in the
    revolution, to hold down one&#8217;s adversaries by force, it is
    sheer nonsense to talk of a &#8216;free people&#8217;s
    state&#8217;; so long as the proletariat still needs the state, it
    does not need it in the interests of freedom but in order to hold
    down its adversaries, and as soon as it becomes possible to speak
    of freedom the state as such ceases to exist. . . .&#8221;<a id="bk16"
    href="#fw16" name="bk16"><sup class="enote">[16]</sup></a></p>

    <p>Kautsky is as far removed from Marx and Engels as heaven is
    from earth, as a liberal from a proletarian revolutionary. The
    pure democracy and simple &#8220;democracy&#8221; that Kautsky
    talks about is merely a paraphrase of the &#8220;free
    people&#8217;s state&#8221;, i.e., <em><em>sheer
    nonsense.</em> Kautsky, with the learned air of a most
    learned armchair fool, or with the innocent air of a ten-year-old
    schoolgirl, asks: Why do we need a dictatorship when we have a
    majority? And Marx and Engels explain:</p>

    <p>&#8212;to break down the resistance of the bourgeoisie;</p>

    <p>&#8212;to inspire the reactionaries with fear;</p>

    <p>&#8212;to maintain the authority of the armed people against
    the bourgeoisie;</p>

    <p>&#8212;that the proletariat may forcibly hold down its
    adversaries.</p>

    <p>Kautsky does not understand these explanations. Infatuated with
    the &#8220;purity&#8221; of democracy, blind to its bourgeois
    character, he &#8220;consistently&#8221; urges that the majority,
    since it is the majority, need not &#8220;break down the
    resistance&#8221; of the minority, nor &#8220;forcibly hold it
    down&#8221;&#8212;it is sufficient to suppress
    <em>cases</em> of infringement of democracy. Infatuated with
    the &#8220;purity&#8221; of democracy, Kautsky <em>inadvertently</em>
    commits the same little error that all bourgeois democrats always
    commit, namely, he takes formal equality (which is nothing but a
    fraud and hypocrisy under capitalism) for actual equality! Quite a
    trifle!</p>

    <p>The exploiter and the exploited cannot be equal.</p>

    <p>This truth, however unpleasant it may be to Kautsky,
    nevertheless forms the essence of socialism.</p>

    <p>Another truth: there can be no real, actual equality until all
    possibility of the exploitation of one class by another has been
    totally destroyed.</p>

    <p>The exploiters can be defeated at one stroke in the event of a
    successful uprising at the centre, or of a revolt in the army. But
    except in very rare and special cases, the exploiters cannot be
    destroyed at one stroke. It is impossible to expropriate all the
    landowners and capitalists of any big country at one
    stroke. Furthermore, expropriation alone, as a legal or political
    act, does not settle the matter by a long chalk, because it is
    necessary to <em>depose</em> the landowners and capitalists in
    actual fact, to <em>replace</em> their management of the factories
    and estates by a different management, workers&#8217; management,
    in actual fact. There can be no equality between the
    exploiters&#8212;who for many generations have been better off
    because of their education, conditions of wealthy life, and
    habits&#8212;and the exploited, the majority of whom even in the
    most advanced and most democratic bourgeois republics are
    downtrodden, backward, ignorant, intimidated and disunited. For a
    long time after the revolution the exploiters inevitably continue
    to retain a number of great practical advantages: they still have
    money (since it is impossible to abolish money all at once); some
    movable property&#8212;often fairly considerable; they still have
    various connections, habits of organisation and management;
    knowledge of all the &#8220;secrets&#8221; (customs, methods,
    means and possibilities) of management; superior education; close
    connections with the higher technical personnel (who live and
    think like the bourgeoisie); incomparably greater experience in
    the art of war (this is very important), and so on and so
    forth.</p>

    <p>If the exploiters are defeated in one country only&#8212;and
    this, of course, is typical, since a simultaneous revolution in a
    number of countries is a rare exception&#8212;they <em>still</em>
    remain stronger than the exploited, for the international
    connections of the exploiters are enormous. That a section of the
    exploited from the least advanced middle-peasant, artisan and
    similar groups of the population may, and indeed does, follow the
    exploiters has been proved by <em>all</em> revolutions, including
    the Commune (for there were also proletarians among the Versailles
    troops, which the most learned Kautsky has
    &#8220;forgotten&#8221;).</p>

    <p>In these circumstances, to assume that in a revolution which is
    at all profound and serious the issue is decided simply by the
    relation between the majority and the minority is the acme of
    stupidity, the silliest prejudice of a common liberal, an attempt
    to <em>deceive the people</em> by concealing from them a
    well-established historical truth. This historical truth is that
    in every profound revolution, the <em>prolonged, stubborn and
    desperate</em> resistance of the exploiters, who for a number of
    years retain important practical advantages over the exploited, is
    the <em>rule.</em> Never&#8212;except in the sentimental fantasies
    of the sentimental fool Kautsky&#8212;will the exploiters submit
    to the decision of the exploited majority without trying to make
    use of their advantages in a last desperate battle, or series of
    battles.</p>

    <p>The transition from capitalism to communism takes an entire
    historical epoch. Until this epoch is over, the exploiters
    inevitably cherish the hope of restoration, and this <em>hope</em>
    turns into <em>attempts</em> at restoration. After their first
    serious defeat, the overthrown exploiters&#8212;who had not
    expected their overthrow, never believed it possible, never
    conceded the thought of it&#8212;throw themselves with energy
    grown tenfold, with furious passion and hatred grown a
    hundredfold, into the battle for the recovery of the
    &#8220;paradise&#8221;, of which they were deprived, on behalf of
    their families, who had been leading such a sweet and easy life
    and whom now the &#8220;common herd&#8221; is condemning to ruin
    and destitution (or to &#8220;common&#8221; labour . . .). In the
    train of the capitalist exploiters follow the wide sections of the
    petty bourgeoisie, with regard to whom decades of historical
    experience of all countries testify that they vacillate and
    hesitate, one day marching behind the proletariat and the next day
    taking fright at the difficulties of the revolution; that they
    become panic-stricken at the first defeat or semidefeat of the
    workers, grow nervous, run about aimlessly, snivel, and rush from
    one camp into the other&#8212;just like our Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries.</p>

    <p>In these circumstances, in an epoch of desperately acute war,
    when history presents the question of whether age-old and
    thousand-year-old privileges are to be or not to be&ndash;at such a time
    to talk about majority and minority, about pure democracy, about
    dictatorship being unnecessary and about equality between the
    exploiter and the exploited! What infinite stupidity and abysmal
    philistinism are needed for this!</p>

    <p>However, during the decades of comparatively
    &#8220;peaceful&#8221; capitalism between 1871 and 1914, the
    Augean stables of philistinism, imbecility, and apostasy
    accumulated in the socialist parties which were adapting
    themselves to opportunism. . . .</p>

    <center>* &#160; &#160; *</center>
    <center>*</center>

    <p>The reader will probably have noticed that Kautsky, in the
    passage from his pamphlet quoted above, speaks of an attempt to
    encroach upon universal suffrage (calling it, by the way, a deep
    source of mighty moral authority, whereas Engels, apropos of the
    same Paris Commune and the same question of dictatorship, spoke of
    the authority of the armed people against the bourgeoisie&#8212;a
    very characteristic difference between the philistine&#8217;s and
    the revolutionary&#8217;s views on
    &#8220;authority&#8221; . . .).</p>

    <p>It should be observed that the question of depriving the
    exploiters of the franchise is a <em>purely Russian</em> question,
    and not a question of the dictatorship of the proletariat in
    general. Had Kautsky, casting aside hypocrisy, entitled his
    pamphlet <em>Against the Bolsheviks</em>, the title would have
    corresponded to the contents of the pamphlet, and Kautsky would
    have been justified in speaking bluntly about the franchise. But
    Kautsky wanted to come out primarily as a
    &#8220;theoretician&#8221;. He called his pamphlet <em>The
    Dictatorship of the Proletariat&#8212;in general.</em> He speaks
    about the Soviets and about Russia specifically only in the second
    part of the pamphlet, beginning with the sixth paragraph. The
    subject dealt with in the first part (from which I took the
    quotation) is <em>democracy</em> and <em>dictatorship in
    general.</em> In speaking about the franchise, Kautsky
    <em>betrayed himself</em> as an opponent of the Bolsheviks,
    <em>who does not care a brass farthing for theory</em>. For
    theory, i.e., the reasoning about the general (and not the
    nationally specific) class foundations of democracy and
    dictatorship, ought to deal not with a special question, such as
    the franchise, but with the general question of whether democracy
    can be <em>preserved for the rich, for the exploiters</em> in the
    historical period of the overthrow of the exploiters and the
    replacement of their state by the state of the exploited. 

    </p>
    <p>
      That is the way, the only way, a theoretician can present the
      question.</p>

    <p>We know the example of the Paris Commune, we know all that was
      said by the founders of Marxism in connection with it and in
      reference to it. On the basis of this material I examined, for
      instance, the question of democracy and dictatorship in my
      pamphlet, <em>The State and Revolution</em>, written before the October
	Revolution. <em>I did not say anything at all</em> about restricting
      the franchise. And it must be said now that the question of
      restricting the franchise is a nationally specific and not a
      general question of the dictatorship. One must approach the
      question of restricting the franchise by studying the <em>specific
      conditions</em> of the Russian revolution and the <em>specific
      path</em> of its development. This will be done later on in
      this pamphlet. It would be a mistake, however, to guarantee in
      advance that the impending proletarian revolutions in Europe will
      all, or the majority of them, be necessarily accompanied by
      restriction of the franchise for the bourgeoisie. It may be
      so. After the war and the experience of the Russian revolution it
      probably will be so; but it is <em>not absolutely necessary</em>
      for the exercise of the dictatorship, it is not an
      <em>indispensable</em> characteristic of the logical concept
      &#8220;dictatorship&#8221;, it does not enter as an
      <em>indispensable</em> condition in the historical and class
      concept &#8220;dictatorship&#8221;.</p>
    
    <p>The indispensable characteristic, the necessary condition of
      dictatorship is the <em>forcible</em> suppression of the
      exploiters as a <em>class,</em> and, consequently, the
      <em>infringement</em> of &#8220;pure democracy&#8221;, i.e., of
      equality and freedom, <em>in regard to</em> that
      <em>class.</em></p>

    <p>This is the way, the only way, the question can be put
    theoretically. And by failing to put the question thus, Kautsky
    has shown that he opposes the Bolsheviks not as a theoretician,
    but as a sycophant of the opportunists and the bourgeoisie.</p>

    <p>In which countries, and given what national features of
    capitalism, democracy for the exploiters will be in one or another
    form restricted (wholly or in part), infringed upon, is a question
    of the specific national features of this or that capitalism, of
    this or that revolution. The theoretical question is different: Is
    the dictatorship of the proletariat possible <em>without
    infringing democracy</em> in relation to the <em>exploiting</em> class?</p>

    <p>It is precisely this question, the <em>only</em> theoretically
    important and essential one, that Kautsky has evaded. He has
    quoted all sorts of passages from Marx and Engels, <em>except
    those</em> which bear on this question, and which I quoted
    above.</p>

    <p>Kautsky talks about anything you like, about everything that is
    acceptable to liberals and bourgeois democrats and does not go
    beyond their circle of ideas, but he does not talk about the main
    thing, namely, the fact that the proletariat cannot achieve
    victory <em>without breaking the resistance</em> of the
    bourgeoisie, <em>without forcibly suppressing its
    adversaries</em>, and that, where there is &#8220;forcible
    suppression&#8221;, where there is no &#8220;freedom&#8221;,
    <em>there is, of course, no democracy</em>.</p>

    <p>This Kautsky has not understood.</p>

    <center>* &#160; &#160; *</center>
    <center>*</center>

    <p>We shall now examine the experience of the Russian revolution
      and that divergence between the Soviets of Deputies and the
      Constituent Assembly which led to the dissolution of the latter
      and to the withdrawal of the franchise from the bourgeoisie.
