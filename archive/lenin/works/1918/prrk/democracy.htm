    <h3> Bourgeois And Proletarian Democracy</h3>

    <p class="fst">The question which Kautsky has so shamelessly muddled really
    stands as follows.</p>

    <p>If we are not to mock at common sense and history, it is
    obvious that we cannot speak of &#8220;pure democracy&#8221; as long as
    different <em>classes</em> exist; we can only speak of
    <em>class</em> democracy. (Let us say in parenthesis that
    &#8220;pure democracy&#8221; is not only an <em>ignorant</em>
    phrase, revealing a lack of understanding both of the class
    struggle and of the nature of the state, but also a thrice-empty
    phrase, since in communist society democracy will <em>wither
    away</em> in the process of changing and becoming a habit, but
    will never be &#8220;pure&#8221; democracy.)</p>

    <p>&#8220;Pure democracy&#8221; is the mendacious phrase of a
    liberal who wants to fool the workers. History knows of bourgeois
    democracy which takes the place of feudalism, and of proletarian
    democracy which takes the place of bourgeois democracy.</p>

    <p>When Kautsky devotes dozens of pages to &#8220;proving&#8221;
    the truth that bourgeois democracy is progressive compared with
    medievalism, and that the proletariat must unfailingly utilise it
    in its struggle against the bourgeoisie, that in fact is just
    liberal twaddle intended to fool the workers. This is a truism,
    not only for educated Germany, but also for uneducated
    Russia. Kautsky is simply throwing &#8220;learned&#8221; dust in
    the eyes of the workers when, with a pompous mien, he talks about
    Weitling and the Jesuits of Paraguay and many other things, <em>in
    order to avoid</em> telling about the <em>bourgeois</em> essence
    of modern, i.e., <em>capitalist,</em> democracy.</p>

    <p>Kautsky takes from Marxism what is acceptable to the 
      liberals, to the bourgeoisie (the criticism of the Middle Ages,
      and the progressive historical role of capitalism in general and
      of capitalist democracy in particular), and discards, passes
      over in silence, glosses over all that in Marxism which is
      <em>unacceptable</em> to the bourgeoisie (the revolutionary
      violence of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie for the
      latter&#8217;s destruction). That is why Kautsky, by virtue of
      his objective position and irrespective of what his subjective
      convictions may be, inevitably proves to be a lackey of the
      bourgeoisie.</p>
    
    <p>Bourgeois democracy, although a great historical advance in
    comparison with medievalism, always remains, and under capitalism
    is bound to remain, restricted, truncated, false and hypocritical,
    a paradise for the rich and a snare and deception for the
    exploited, for the poor. It is this truth, which forms a most
    essential part of Marx&#8217;s teaching, that Kautsky the
    &#8220;Marxist&#8221; has failed to understand. On this&#8212;the
    fundamental issue&#8212;Kautsky offers &#8220;delights&#8221; for
    the bourgeoisie instead of a scientific criticism of those
    conditions which make every bourgeois democracy a democracy for
    the rich.</p>

    <p>Let us first remind the most learned Mr. Kautsky of the
    theoretical propositions of Marx and Engels which that pedant has
    so disgracefully &#8220;forgotten&#8221; (to please the
    bourgeoisie), and then explain the matter as popularly as
    possible.</p>

    <p>Not only the ancient and feudal, but also &#8220;the modern
    representative state is an instrument of exploitation of
    wage-labour by capital&#8221; (Engels, in his work on the
    state).<a id="bk08" href="#fw08" name="bk08"><sup
    class="enote">[8]</sup></a> &#8220;As, therefore, the state is
    only a transitional institution which is used in the struggle, in
    the revolution, to hold down one&#8217;s adversaries by force, it
    is sheer nonsense to talk of a &#8217;free people&#8217;s
    state&#8217;; so long as the proletariat still <em>needs</em> the
    state, it does not need it in the interests of freedom but in
    order to hold down its adversaries, and as soon as it becomes
    possible to speak of freedom the state as such ceases to
    exist&#8221; (Engels, in his letter to Bebel, March 28,
    1875). &#8220;In reality, however, the state is nothing but a
    machine for the oppression of one class by another, and indeed in
    the democratic republic no less than in the monarchy&#8221;
    (Engels, Introduction to  <a
    href="../../../../marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm"><em>The
    Civil War in France</em></a> by Marx).<a id="bk09" href="#fw09"
    name="bk09"><sup class="enote">[9]</sup></a>;  Universal suffrage
    is &#8220;the gauge of the maturity of the work ing class. It
    <em>cannot and never will be anything more in the present-day
    state</em>&#8221;. (Engels, in his work on the state.<a id="bk10"
    href="#fw10" name="bk10"><sup class="enote">[10]</sup></a>
    Mr. Kautsky very tediously chews over the cud in the first part of
    this proposition, which is acceptable to the bourgeoisie. But the
    second part, which we have italicised and which is not acceptable
    to the bourgeoisie, the renegade Kautsky passes over in silence!)
    &#8220;The Commune was to be a working, not a parliamentary, body,
    executive and legislative at the same time. . . . Instead of
    deciding once in three or six years which member of the ruling
    class was to represent and suppress (<em>ver- und zertreten</em>)
    the people in Parliament, universal suffrage was to serve the
    people, constituted in Communes, as individual suffrage serves
    every other employer in the search for workers, foremen and
    accountants for his business&#8221; (Marx, in his work on the
    Paris Commune, <a
    href="../../../../marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm"><em>The
    Civil War in France</em></a>).<a id="bk11" href="#fw11"
    name="bk11"><sup class="enote">[11]</sup></a> </p>

    <p>Every one of these propositions, which are excellently known to
    the most learned Mr. Kautsky, is a slap in his face and lays bare
    his apostasy. Nowhere in his pamphlet does Kautsky reveal the
    slightest understanding of these truths. His whole pamphlet is a
    sheer mockery of Marxism!</p>

    <p>Take the fundamental laws of modern states, take their
    administration, take freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, or
    &#8220;equality of all citizens before the law,&#8221; and you
    will see at every turn evidence of the hypocrisy of bourgeois
    democracy with which every honest and class-conscious worker is
    familiar. There is not a single state, however democratic, which
    has no loopholes or reservations in its constitution guaranteeing
    the bourgeoisie the possibility of dispatching troops against the
    workers, of proclaiming martial law, and so forth, in case of a
    &#8220;violation of public order,&#8221; and actually in case the
    exploited class &#8220;violates&#8221; its position of slavery and
    tries to behave in a non-slavish manner. Kautsky shamelessly
    embellishes bourgeois democracy and omits to mention, for
    instance, how the most democratic and republican bourgeoisie in
    America or Switzerland deal with workers on strike.</p>

    <p>The wise and learned Kautsky keeps silent about these things!
      That learned politician does not realise that to remain silent on
      this matter is despicable. He prefers to tell the workers nursery
      tales of the kind that democracy

      means &#8220;protecting the minority&#8221;. It is incredible,
      but it is a fact! In the year of our Lord 1918, in the fifth year
      of the world imperialist slaughter and the strangulation of
      internationalist minorities (i.e., those who have not despicably
      betrayed socialism, like the Renaudels and Longuets, the
      Scheidemanns and Kautskys, the Hendersons and Webbs et al.) in all
      &#8220;democracies&#8221; of the world, the learned Mr. Kautsky
      sweetly, very sweetly, sings the praises of &#8220;protection of
      the minority&#8221;. Those who are interested may read this on
      page 15 of Kautsky&#8217;s pamphlet. And on page 16 this learned
      . . . individual tells you about the Whigs and Tories in England in
      the eighteenth century!</p>

    <p>What wonderful erudition! What refined servility to the
    bourgeoisie! What civilised belly-crawling before the capitalists
    and boot-licking! If I were Krupp or Scheidemann, or Clemenceau or
    Renaudel, I would pay Mr. Kautsky millions, reward him with Judas
    kisses, praise him before the workers and urge &#8220;socialist
    unity&#8221; with &#8220;honourable&#8221; men like him. To write
    pamphlets against the dictatorship of the proletariat, to talk
    about the Whigs and Tories in England in the eighteenth century,
    to assert that democracy means &#8220;protecting the
    minority,&#8221; and remain silent about <em>pogroms</em> against
    internationalists in the &#8220;democratic&#8221; republic of
    America&#8212;isn&#8217;t this rendering lackey service to the
    bourgeoisie?</p>

    <p>The learned Mr. Kautsky has &#8220;forgotten&#8221; &#8212;
    accidentally forgotten, probably&#8212;a &#8220;trifle,&#8221;
    namely, that the ruling party in a bourgeois democracy extends the
    protection of the minority only to another <em>bourgeois</em>
    party, while the proletariat, on all <em>serious, profound and
    fundamental</em> issues, gets martial law or pogroms, instead of
    the &#8220;protection of the minority&#8221;. <em>The more highly
    developed a democracy is, the more imminent are pogroms or civil
    war in connection with any profound political divergence which is
    dangerous to the bourgeoisie.</em> The learned Mr. Kautsky could
    have studied this &#8220;law&#8221; of bourgeois democracy in
    connection with the Dreyfus case<a id="bk12" href="#fw12"
    name="bk12"><sup class="enote">[12]</sup></a>  in republican
    France, with the lynching of Negroes and internationalists in the
    democratic republic of America, with the case of Ireland and
    Ulster in democratic Britain,<a id="bk13" href="#fw13"
    name="bk13"><sup class="enote">[13]</sup></a> with the baiting
    of the Bolsheviks and the staging of pogroms against them in April
    1917 in the democratic republic of Russia. I have purposely
    chosen examples not only from wartime but also from pre-war time,
    peacetime. But mealy-mouthed Mr. Kautsky prefers to shut his eyes
    to these facts of the twentieth century, and instead to tell the
    workers wonderfully new, remarkably interesting, unusually
    edifying and incredibly important things about the Whigs and
    Tories of the eighteenth century!</p>

    <p>Take the bourgeois parliament. Can it be that the learned
    Kautsky has never heard that the <em>more highly</em> democracy is
    developed, the <em>more</em> the bourgeois parliaments are
    subjected by the stock exchange and the bankers? This does not
    mean that we must not make use of bourgeois parliament (the
    Bolsheviks made better use of it than probably any other party in
    the world, for in 1912&ndash;14 we won the entire workers&#8217; curia
    in the Fourth Duma). But it does mean that only a liberal can
    forget the <em>historical limitations and conventional nature</em>
    of the bourgeois parliamentary system as Kautsky does. Even in the
    most democratic bourgeois state the oppressed people at every step
    encounter the crying contradiction between the <em>formal</em>
    equality proclaimed by the &#8220;democracy&#8221; of the
    capitalists and the thousands of <em>real</em> limitations and
    subterfuges which turn the proletarians into <em>wage-slaves.</em> It
    is precisely this contradiction that is opening the eyes of the
    people to the rottenness, mendacity and hypocrisy of
    capitalism. It is this contradiction that the agitators and
    propagandists of socialism are constantly exposing to the people,
    <em>in order to prepare</em> them for revolution! And now that the
    era of revolution <em>has begun,</em> Kautsky turns his back upon
    it and begins to extol the charms of <em>moribund</em> bourgeois
    democracy.</p>

    <p>Proletarian democracy, of which Soviet government is one of the
    forms, has brought a development and expansion of democracy
    unprecedented in the world, for the vast majority of the
    population, for the exploited and working people. To write a whole
    pamphlet about democracy, as Kautsky did, in which two pages are
    devoted to dictatorship and dozens to &#8220;pure
    democracy,&#8221; and <em>fail to notice</em> this fact, means
    completely distorting the subject in liberal fashion.</p>

    <p>Take foreign policy. In no bourgeois state, not even in the
    most democratic, is it conducted openly. The people are deceived
    everywhere, and in democratic France, Switzerland, America and
    Britain this is done on an incomparably wider scale and in an
    incomparably subtler manner than in other countries. The Soviet
    government has torn the veil of mystery from foreign policy in a
    revolutionary manner. Kautsky has not noticed this, he keeps
    silent about it, although in the era of predatory wars and secret
    treaties for the &#8220;division of spheres of influence&#8221;
    (i.e., for the partition of the world among the capitalist
    bandits) this is of <em>cardinal</em> importance, for on it
    depends the question of peace, the life and death of tens of
    millions of people.</p>

    <p>Take the structure of the state. Kautsky picks at all manner of
    &#8220;trifles,&#8221; down to the argument that under the Soviet
    Constitution elections are &#8220;indirect,&#8221; but he misses
    the point. He fails to see the <em>class</em> nature of the state
    apparatus, of the machinery of state. Under bourgeois democracy
    the capitalists, by thousands of tricks&#8212;which are the more
    artful and effective the more &#8220;pure&#8221; democracy is
    developed&#8212;<em>drive</em> the people <em>away</em> from administrative work,
    from freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, etc. The Soviet
    government is the <em>first</em> in the world (or strictly
    speaking, the second, because the Paris Commune began to do the
    same thing) to <em>enlist</em> the people, specifically the
    <em>exploited</em> people, in the work of administration. The working
    people are <em>barred</em> from participation in bourgeois parliaments
    (they <em>never decide</em> important questions under bourgeois
    democracy, which are decided by the stock exchange and the banks)
    by thousands of obstacles, and the workers know and feel, see and
    realise perfectly well that the bourgeois parliaments are
    institutions <em>alien</em> to them, <em>instruments for the
    oppression</em> of the workers by the bourgeoisie, institutions of
    a hostile class, of the exploiting minority.</p>

    <p>The Soviets are the direct organisation of the working and
    exploited people themselves, which <em>helps</em> them to organise
    and administer their own state in every possible way. And in this
    it is the vanguard of the working and exploited people, the urban
    proletariat, that enjoys the advantage of being best united by the
    large enterprises; it is easier for it than for all others to
    elect and exercise control over those elected. The Soviet form of
    organisation automatically helps to unite all the working and
    exploited people around their vanguard, the proletariat. The old
    bourgeois apparatus&#8212;the bureaucracy, the privileges of wealth, of
    bourgeois education, of social connections, etc. (these real
    privileges are the more varied the more highly bourgeois democracy
    is developed)&#8212;all this disappears under the Soviet form of
    organisation. Freedom of the press ceases to be hypocrisy, because
    the printing-plants and stocks of paper are taken away from the
    bourgeoisie. The same thing applies to the best buildings, the
    palaces, the mansions and manorhouses. Soviet power took thousands
    upon thousands of these best buildings from the exploiters at one
    stroke, and in this way made the right of assembly&#8212;without
    which democracy is a fraud&#8212;a <em>million times</em> more
    democratic for the people. Indirect elections to non-local Soviets
    make it easier to hold congresses of Soviets, they make the
    <em>entire</em> apparatus less costly, more flexible, more
    accessible to the workers and peasants at a time when life is
    seething and it is necessary to be able very quickly to recall
    one&#8217;s local deputy or to delegate him to a general congress
    of Soviets.</p>

    <p>Proletarian democracy is a <em>million times</em> more
    democratic than any bourgeois democracy; Soviet power is a million
    times more democratic than the most democratic bourgeois
    republic.</p>

    <p>To fail to see this one must either deliberately serve the
    bourgeoisie, or be politically as dead as a doornail, unable to
    see real life from behind the dusty pages of bourgeois books, be
    thoroughly imbued with bourgeois-democratic prejudices, and
    thereby objectively convert oneself into a lackey of the
    bourgeoisie.</p>

    <p>To fail to see this one must be incapable of <em>presenting the
    question</em> from the point of view of the <em>oppressed classes:
      </em> </p>
    
    <p>Is there a single country in the world, even among the most
    democratic bourgeois countries, in which the <em>average
    rank-and-file</em> worker, the average rank-and-file <em>farm
    labourer</em>, or village semi-proletarian generally (i.e., the
    representative of the oppressed, of the overwhelming majority of
    the population), enjoys anything approaching such <em>liberty</em> of
    holding meetings in the best buildings, such <em>liberty</em> of using
    the largest printing-plants and biggest stocks of paper to express
    his ideas and to defend his interests, such <em>liberty</em> of
    promoting men and women of his own class to administer and to
    &#8220;knock into shape&#8221; the state, as in Soviet Russia?</p>

    <p>It is ridiculous to think that Mr. Kautsky could find in any
    country even one out of a thousand of well-informed workers or
    farm labourers who would have any doubts as to the
    reply. Instinctively, from hearing fragments of admissions of the
    truth in the bourgeois press, the workers of the whole world
    sympathise with the Soviet Republic precisely because they regard
    it as a <em>proletarian</em> democracy, <em>a democracy for the poor</em>,
    and not a democracy for the rich that every bourgeois democracy,
    even the best, actually is.</p>

    <p>We are governed (and our state is &#8220;knocked into
    shape&#8221;) by bourgeois bureaucrats, by bourgeois members of
    parliament, by bourgeois judges&#8212;such is the simple, obvious and
    indisputable truth which tens and hundreds of millions of people
    belonging to the oppressed classes in all bourgeois countries,
    including the most democratic, know from their own experience,
    feel and realise every day.</p>

    <p>In Russia, however, the bureaucratic machine has been
    completely smashed, razed to the ground; the old judges have all
    been sent packing, the bourgeois parliament has been
    dispersed&#8212;and <em>far more accessible</em> representation
    has been given to the workers and peasants; <em>their</em> Soviets
    have replaced the bureaucrats, or <em>their</em> Soviets have been
    put in control of the bureaucrats, and <em>their</em> Soviets have
    been authorised to elect the judges. This fact alone is enough for
    all the oppressed classes to recognise that Soviet power, i.e.,
    the present form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, is a
    million times more democratic than the most democratic bourgeois
    republic.</p>

    <p>Kautsky does not understand this truth, which is so clear and
    obvious to every worker, because he has &#8220;forgotten,&#8221;
    &#8220;unlearned&#8221; to put the question: democracy <em>for
    which class</em>? He argues from the point of view of
    &#8220;pure&#8221; (i.e., non-class? or above-class?)
    democracy. He argues like Shylock: my &#8220;pound of flesh&#8221;
    and nothing else. Equality for all citizens&#8212;otherwise there is no
    democracy.</p>

    <p>We must ask the learned Kautsky, the &#8220;Marxist&#8221; and
    &#8220;socialist&#8221; Kautsky:</p>

    <p>Can there be equality between the exploited and the exploiters?

    </p>
    <p>
      It is dreadful, it is incredible that such a question should have
      to be put in discussing a book written by the ideological leader
      of the Second International. But &#8220;having put your hand to
      the plough, don&#8217;t look back,&#8221; and having undertaken to
      write about Kautsky, I must explain to the learned man why there
      can be no equality between the exploiter and the exploited.

    In 1894 reactionary monarchist circles in France instituted
    proceedings against Dreyfus, a Jewish General Staff officer, on a
    trumped-up charge of espionage and high treason. The trial of
    Dreyfus, who was sentenced to life imprisonment, served as a
    pretext for French reactionary circles to fan anti-Semitism and
    campaign against republican order and democratic liberties. In
    1898 socialists and progressive bourgeois democrats (<a

    Zola</a>, <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/people/j/a.htm#jaures">Jean
    Jaur&#232;s</a>, Anatole France and others) started a campaign for
    a reconsideration of the Dreyfus case. This gave a political
    colouring to the matter and the country split into two
    camps&#8212;republicans and democrats on the one side and the bloc
    of monarchists, clericals, anti-Semites and nationalists on the
    other. In 1899, under pressure of public opinion, Dreyfus was
    pardoned and in 1906 the Court of Appeal acquitted him and
    reinstated him in the army.

    the &#8216;freedom-loving&#8217; English . . . suppressed by
    executions.&#8221; (<em>Collected Works</em>, Vol. 22, p. 354.)
