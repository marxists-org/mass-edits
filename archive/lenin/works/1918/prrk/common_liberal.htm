    <hr />

    <h3>How Kautsky Turned Marx Into A Common Liberal</h3>

    <p>
      The fundamental question that Kautsky <a href="../../../../kautsky/1918/dictprole/index.htm">discusses in his pamphlet</a> 
      is that of the very essence of proletarian revolution, namely,
      the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a question that is
      of the greatest importance for all countries, especially for the
      advanced ones, especially for those at war, and especially at
      the present time. One may say without fear of exaggeration that
      this is the key problem of the entire proletarian class
      struggle. It is, therefore, necessary to pay particular
      attention to it .</p>

    <p>Kautsky formulates the question as follows: &#8220;The contrast
      between the two socialist trends&#8221; (i.e., the Bolsheviks and
      non-Bolsheviks) &#8220;is the contrast between two radically
      different methods: the <em>dictatorial</em> and the <em>democratic</em>&#8221;
      (p. 3).</p>

    <p>Let us point out, in passing, that when calling the
      non-Bolsheviks in Russia, i.e., the Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, socialists, Kautsky was guided by
      their <em>name</em>, that is, by a word, and not by the <em>actual place</em> they
      occupy in the struggle between the proletariat and the
      bourgeoisie. What a wonderful understanding and application of
      Marxism! But more of this later.</p>

    <p>For the moment we must deal with the main point, namely, with
      Kautsky&#8217;s great discovery of the &#8220;fundamental
      contrast&#8221; between &#8220;democratic and dictatorial
      methods&#8221;. That is the crux of the matter; that is the
      essence of Kautsky&#8217;s pamphlet. And that is such an awful
      theoretical muddle, such a complete renunciation of Marxism, that
      Kautsky, it must be confessed, has far excelled Bernstein.</p>

    <p>The question of the dictatorship of the proletariat is a
      question of the relation of the proletarian state to the
      bourgeois state, of proletarian democracy to bourgeois
      democracy. One would think that this is as plain as a
      pikestaff. But Kautsky, like a schoolmaster who has become as
      dry as dust from quoting the same old textbooks on history,
      persistently turns his back on the twentieth century and his
      face to the eighteenth century, and for the hundredth time, in a
      number of paragraphs, in an incredibly tedious fashion chews the
      old cud over the relation of bourgeois democracy to absolutism
      and medievalism!</p>

    <p>It sounds just like he were chewing rags in his sleep!</p>

    <p>But this means he utterly fails to understand what is what! One
      cannot help smiling at Kautsky&#8217;s effort to make it appear
      that there are people who preach &#8220;contempt for
      democracy&#8221; (p. 11) and so forth. That is the sort of
      twaddle Kautsky uses to befog and confuse the issue, for he
      talks like the liberals, speaking of democracy in general, and
      not of <em>bourgeois</em> democracy; he even avoids using this precise,
      class term, and, instead, tries to speak about
      &#8220;presocialist&#8221; democracy. This windbag devotes
      almost one-third of his pamphlet, twenty pages out of
      sixty-three, to this twaddle, which is so agreeable to the
      bourgeoisie, for it is tantamount to embellishing bourgeois
      democracy, and obscures the question of the proletarian
      revolution.</p>

    <p>But, after all, the title of Kautsky&#8217;s pamphlet is
      <em>The Dictatorship of the Proletariat.</em> Everybody knows that
      this is the very <em>essence</em> of Marx&#8217;s doctrine; and
      after a lot of irrelevant twaddle Kautsky <em>was obliged</em> to
      quote Marx&#8217;s words on the dictatorship of the
      proletariat.</p>

    <p>But the <em>way</em> in which he the &#8220;Marxist&#8221; did
      it was simply farcical! Listen to this:</p>

    <p>&#8220;This view&#8221; (which Kautsky dubs &#8220;contempt for
      democracy&#8221;) &#8220;rests upon a single word of Karl
      Marx&#8217;s&#8221;. This is what Kautsky literally says on page
      20. And on page 60 the same thing is repeated even in the form
      that they (the Bolsheviks) &#8220;opportunely recalled the little
      word&#8221; (that is literally what he says&#8212;<em>des
	W&#246;rtchens!!)</em> &#8220;about the dictatorship of the
      proletariat which Marx once used in 1875 in a letter&#8221;.</p>

    <p>Here is Marx&#8217;s &#8220;little word":</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;Between capitalist and communist society
      lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one
      into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political
      transition period in which the state can be nothing but the
      revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.&#8221;<a
      id="bk03" href="#fw03" name="bk03"><sup
      class="enote">[3]</sup></a>
    </p>

    <p>First of all, to call this classical reasoning of Marx&#8217;s,
      which sums up the whole of his revolutionary teaching, &#8220;a
      single word&#8221; and even &#8220;a little word,&#8221; is an
      insult to and complete renunciation of Marxism. It must not be
      forgotten that Kautsky knows Marx almost by heart, and, judging
      by all he has written, he has in his desk, or in his head, a
      number of pigeon-holes in which all that was ever written by
      Marx is most carefully filed so as to be ready at hand for
      quotation. Kautsky <em>must know</em> that both Marx and Engels,
      in their letters as well as in their published works,
      <em>repeatedly</em> spoke about the dictatorship of the
      proletariat, before and especially after the <a
      href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/p/a.htm#paris-commune">Paris
      Commune</a>. Kautsky must know that the formula
      &#8220;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8221; is merely a more
      historically concrete and scientifically exact formulation of
      the proletariat&#8217;s task of &#8220;smashing&#8221; the
      bourgeois state machine, about which both Marx and Engels, in
      summing up the experience of the Revolution of 1848, and, still
      more so, of 1871, spoke <em>for forty years,</em> between 1852
      and 1891. 
      
    </p>
    <p>
      How is this monstrous distortion of Marxism by that
      Marxist pedant Kautsky to be explained? As far as the
      philosophical roots of this phenomenon are concerned, it amounts
      to the substitution of eclecticism and sophistry for
      dialectics. Kautsky is a past master at this sort of
      substitution. Regarded from the point of view of practical
      politics, it amounts to subservience to the opportunists, that
      is, in the last analysis to the bourgeoisie. Since the outbreak
      of the war, Kautsky has made increasingly rapid progress
      in this art of being a Marxist in words and a lackey of the
      bourgeoisie in deeds, until he has become a virtuoso at it.</p>

    <p>One feels even more convinced of this when examining the
      remarkable way in which Kautsky &#8220;interprets&#8221;
      Marx&#8217;s &#8220;little word&#8221; about the dictatorship of
      the proletariat. Listen to this:</p>

    <p>&#8220;Marx, unfortunately, neglected to show us in greater
      detail how he conceived this dictatorship. . . .&#8221; (This is
      an utterly mendacious phrase of a renegade, for Marx and Engels
      gave us, indeed, quite a number of most detailed indications,
      which Kautsky, the Marxist pedant, has deliberately ignored.)
      &#8220;Literally, the word dictatorship means the abolition of
      democracy. But, of course, taken literally, this word also means
      the undivided rule of a single person unrestricted by any
      laws&#8212;an autocracy, which differs from despotism only insofar as
      it is not meant as a permanent state institution, but as a
      transient emergency measure.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The term, &#8216;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8217;, hence
      not the dictatorship of a single individual, but of a class,
      <em>ipso facto</em> precludes the possibility that Marx in this
      connection had in mind a dictatorship in the literal sense of the
      term.</p>

    <p> &#8220;He speaks here not of a <em>form of government</em>,
      but of a <em>condition</em>, which must necessarily arise wherever the
      proletariat has gained political power. That Marx in this case did
      not have in mind a form of government is proved by the fact that
      he was of the opinion that in Britain and America the transition
      might take place peacefully, i.e., in a democratic way&#8221;
      (p. 20).</p>

    <p>We have deliberately quoted this argument in full so that the
      reader may clearly see the methods Kautsky the
      &#8220;theoretician&#8221; employs.</p>

    <p>Kautsky chose to approach the question in such a way as to
      begin with a definition of the &#8220;<em>word</em>&#8221;
      dictatorship.</p>

    <p>Very well. Everyone has a sacred right to approach a question
      in whatever way he pleases. One must only distinguish a serious
      and honest approach from a dishonest
      one. Anyone who wants to be serious in approaching the question
      in this way ought to give <em>his own definition</em> of the
      &#8220;word&#8221;. Then the question would be put fairly and
      squarely. But Kautsky does not do that. &#8220;Literally,&#8221;
      he writes, &#8220;the word dictatorship means the abolition of
      democracy.&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>In the first place, this is not a definition. If Kautsky wanted
      to avoid giving a definition of the concept dictatorship, why did
      he choose this particular approach to the question?</p>

    <p>Secondly, it is obviously wrong. It is natural for a liberal to
      speak of &#8220;democracy&#8221; in general; but a Marxist will
      never forget to ask: &#8220;for what class?&#8221; Everyone knows,
      for instance (and Kautsky the &#8220;historian&#8221; knows it
      too), that rebellions, or even strong ferment, among the slaves in
      ancient times at once revealed the fact that the ancient state was
      essentially a <em>dictatorship of the slave owners</em>.
    
      Did this dictatorship abolish democracy <em>among</em>, and
      <em>for</em>, the slaveowners? Everyhody knows that it did
      not.</p>

    <p>Kautsky the &#8220;Marxist&#8221; made this monstrously absurd
      and untrue statement because he &#8220;<em>forgot</em>&#8220; the
      class struggle. . . .</p>

    <p>To transform Kautsky&#8217;s liberal and false assertion into a
      Marxist and true one, one must say: dictatorship does not
      necessarily mean the abolition of democracy for the class that
      exercises the dictatorship over other classes; but it does mean
      the abolition (or very material restriction, which is also a form
      of abolition) of democracy for the class over which, or against
      which, the dictatorship is exercised.</p>

    <p>But, however true this assertion may be, it does not give a
      definition of dictatorship.</p>

    <p>Let us examine Kautsky&#8217;s next sentence:</p>
    
    <p class="quote">
      &#8220;. . . But, of course, taken literally, this word also
      means the undivided rule of a single person unrestricted by any
      laws. . . .&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Like a blind puppy sniffing at random first in one direction and
      then in another, Kautsky accidentally stumbled upon <em>one</em>
      true idea (namely, that dictatorship is rule unrestricted by any
      laws), <em>nevertheless,</em> he <em>failed</em> to give a
      definition of dictatorship, and, moreover, he made an obvious
      historical blunder, namely, that dictatorship means the rule of
      a single person. This is even grammatically incorrect, since
      dictatorship may also be exercised by a handful of persons, or
      by an oligarchy, or by a class, etc.</p>

    <p>Kautsky then goes on to point out the difference between
      dictatorship and despotism, but, although what he says is
      obviously incorrect, we shall not dwell upon it, as it is wholly
      irrelevant to the question that interests us. Everyone knows
      Kautsky&#8217;s inclination to turn from the twentieth century
      to the eighteenth, and from the eighteenth century to classical
      antiquity, and we hope that the German proletariat, after it has
      attained its dictatorship, will bear this inclination of his in
      mind and appoint him, say, teacher of ancient history at some
      Gymnasium. To try to evade a definition of the dictatorship of
      the proletariat by philosophising about despotism is either
      crass stupidity or very clumsy trickery.</p>

    <p>As a result, we find that, having undertaken to discuss the
      dictatorship, Kautsky rattled off a great deal of manifest lies,
      but has given no definition! Yet, instead of relying on his
      mental faculties he could have used his memory to extract from
      &#8220;pigeon-holes&#8221; all those instances in which Marx
      speaks of dictatorship. Had he done so, he would certainly have
      arrived either at the following definition or at one in
      substance coinciding with it:</p>

    <p>Dictatorship is rule based directly upon force and unrestricted
      by any laws.</p>
    
    <p>The revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat is rule won
      and maintained by the use of violence by the proletariat against
      the bourgeoisie, rule that is unrestricted by any laws.</p>

    <p>This simple truth, a truth that is as plain as a pikestaff to
      every class-conscious worker (who represents the people, and not
      an upper section of petty-bourgeois scoundrels who have been
      bribed by the capitalists, such as are the social-imperialists
      of all countries), this truth, which is obvious to every
      representative of the exploited classes fighting for their
      emancipation, this truth, which is beyond dispute for every
      Marxist, has to be &#8220;extracted by force&#8221; from the
      most learned Mr. Kautsky! How is it to be explained? Simply by
      that spirit of servility with which the leaders of the Second
      International, who have become contemptible sycophants in the
      service of the bourgeoisie, are imbued.</p>

    <p>Kautsky first committed a sleight of hand by proclaiming the
      obvious nonsense that the word dictatorship, in its literal
      sense, means the dictatorship of a single person, and then&#8212;on
      the strength of this sleight of hand&#8212;he declared that
      &#8220;hence&#8221; Marx&#8217;s words about the dictatorship of
      a class were <em>not</em> meant in the literal sense (but in one
      in which dictatorship does not imply revolutionary violence, but
      the &#8220;peaceful&#8221; winning of a majority under bourgeois&#8212;
      mark you&#8212;&#8220;democracy&#8221;).</p>

    <p>One must, if you please, distinguish between a
    &#8220;condition&#8221; and a &#8220;form of government&#8221;. A
    wonderfully profound distinction; it is like drawing a distinction
    between the &#8220;condition&#8221; of stupidity of a man who
    reasons foolishly and the &#8220;form&#8221; of his stupidity.</p>

    <p>Kautsky <em>finds it necessary</em> to interpret dictatorship
    as a &#8220;condition of domination&#8221; (this is the literal
    expression he uses on the very next page, p. 21), because then
    <em>revolutionary violence, and violent revolution,
    disappear.</em> The &#8220;condition of domination&#8221; is a
    condition in which any majority finds itself under
    ... &#8220;democracy"! Thanks to such a fraud, <em>revolution</em>
    happily <em>disappears</em>! </p>

    <p>The fraud, however, is too crude and will not save Kautsky. One
    cannot hide the fact that dictatorship presupposes and implies a
    &#8220;condition,&#8221; one so disagreeable to renegades, of
    <em>revolutionary violence</em> of one class against another. It
    is patently absurd to draw a distinction between a
    &#8220;condition&#8221; and a &#8220;form of government&#8221;. To
    speak of forms of government in this connection is trebly stupid,
    for every schoolboy knows that monarchy and republic are two
    different forms of government. It must be explained to Mr. Kautsky
    that <em>both</em> these forms of government, like all
    transitional &#8220;forms of government&#8221; under capitalism,
    are only variations of the <em>bourgeois state,</em> that is, of
    the <em>dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
      </em> </p>
    
    <p>Lastly, to speak of forms of government is not only a stupid,
    but also a very crude falsification of Marx, who was very clearly
    speaking here of this or that form or type of <em>state,</em> and
    not of forms of government.</p>

    <p>The proletarian revolution is impossible without the forcible
      destruction of the bourgeois state machine and the substitution
      for it of a <em>new one</em> which, in the words of Engels, is
      &#8220;no longer a state in the proper sense of the 
      word&#8221;.<a id="bk04" href="#fw04" name="bk04"><sup class="enote">[4]</sup></a> 
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of his renegade position,
      Kautsky, however, has to befog and belie all this.</p>

    <p>Look what wretched subterfuges he uses.</p>

    <p>First subterfuge. &#8220;That Marx in this case did not have in
      mind a form of government is proved by the fact that he was of the
      opinion that in Britain and America the transition might take
      place peacefully, i.e., in a democratic way.&#8221;</p>
    
    <p>The <em>form of government</em> has absolutely nothing to do
      with it, for there are monarchies which are not typical of the
      bourgeois <em>state,</em> such, for instance, as have no military
      clique, and there are republics which are quite typical in this
      respect, such, for instance, as have a military clique and a
      bureaucracy. This is a universally known historical and political
      fact, and Kautsky cannot falsify it.</p>
    
    <p>If Kautsky had wanted to argue in a serious and honest manner
    he would have asked himself: Are there historical laws relating to
    revolution which know of no exception? And the reply would have
    been: No, there are no such laws. Such laws only apply to the
    typical, to what Marx once termed the &#8220;ideal,&#8221; meaning
    average, normal, typical capitalism.</p>

    <p>Further, was there in the seventies anything which made England
    and America exceptional <em>in regard to what we</em> <em>are now
    discussing?</em> It will be obvious to anyone at all familiar with
    the requirements of science in regard to the problems of history
    that this question must be put. To fail to put it is tantamount to
    falsifying science, to engaging in sophistry. And, the question
    having been put, there can be no doubt as to the reply: the
    revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat is <em>violence</em>
    against the bourgeoisie; and the necessity of such violence is
    <em>particularly</em> called for, as Marx and Engels have
    repeatedly explained in detail (especially in <em>The Civil War in
    France</em> and in the preface to it), by the existence of
    <em>militarism and a bureaucracy.</em> But it is precisely these
    institutions that were <em>non-existent</em> in Britain and America in
    the seventies, when Marx made his observations (they <em>do</em> exist
    in Britain and in America now)!</p>

    <p>Kautsky has to resort to trickery literally at every step to
    cover up his apostasy!</p>

    <p>And note how he inadvertently betrayed his cloven hoof when he
    wrote: &#8220;peacefully, <em>i.e.</em>, <em>in a democratic way</em>
    &#8221;!</p>

    <p>In defining dictatorship, Kautsky tried his utmost to conceal
    from the reader the fundamental feature of this concept, namely,
    revolutionary <em>violence.</em> But now the truth is out: it is a
    question of the contrast between <em>peaceful</em> and <em>violent
    revolutions</em>.</p>

    <p>That is the crux of the matter. Kautsky has to resort to all
    these subterfuges, sophistries and falsifications only to <em>excuse</em>
    himself from <em>violent</em> revolution, and to conceal his
    renunciation of it, his desertion to the side of the liberal
    labour policy, i.e., to the side of the bourgeoisie. That is the
    crux of the matter.</p>

    <p>Kautsky the &#8220;historian&#8221; so shamelessly falsifies
    history that he &#8220;forgets&#8221; the fundamental fact that
    pre-monopoly capitalism&#8212;which actually reached its zenith in the
    seventies&#8212;was by virtue of its fundamental <em>economic</em>
    traits, which found most typical expression in Britain and in
    America, distinguished by a, relatively speaking, maximum fondness
    for peace and freedom. Imperialism, on the other hand, i.e.,
    monopoly capitalism, which finally matured only in the twentieth
    century, is, by virtue of its fundamental <em>economic</em>
    traits, distinguished by a minimum fondness for peace and freedom,
    and by a maximum and universal development of militarism. To
    &#8220;fail to notice&#8221; this in discussing the extent to
    which a peaceful or violent revolution is typical or probable is
    to stoop to the level of a most ordinary lackey of the
    bourgeoisie.</p>

    <p>Second subterfuge. The Paris Commune was a dictatorship of the
    proletariat, but it was elected by <em>universal</em> suffrage,
    i.e., without depriving the bourgeoisie of the franchise, i.e.,
    &#8220;<em>democratically</em>&#8221;. And Kautsky says
    triumphantly: &#8220;. . . The dictatorship of the proletariat was
    for Marx&#8221; (or: according to Marx) &#8220;a condition which
    necessarily follows from pure democracy, if the proletariat forms
    the majority&#8221; (<em>bei &#252;berwiegendem Proletariat</em>,
    S. 21).</p>

    <p>This argument of Kautsky&#8217;s is so amusing that one truly
    suffers from a veritable <em>embarras de richesses</em> (an
    embarrassment due to the wealth . . . of objections that can be made
    to it). Firstly, it is well known that the flower, the General
    Staff, the upper sections of the bourgeoisie, had fled from Paris
    to Versailles. In Versailles there was the &#8220;socialist&#8221;
    Louis Blanc&#8212;which, by the way, proves the falsity of
    Kautsky&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;all trends&#8221; of
    socialism took part in the Paris Commune. Is it not ridiculous to
    represent the division of the inhabitants of Paris into two
    belligerent camps, one of which embraced the entire militant and
    politically active section of the bourgeoisie, as &#8220;pure
    democracy&#8221; with &#8220;universal suffrage"?</p>

    <p>Secondly, the Paris Commune waged war against Versailles as the
    workers&#8217; government of <em>France</em> against the bourgeois
    government. What have &#8220;pure democracy&#8221; and
    &#8220;universal suffrage&#8221; to do with it, when Paris was
    deciding the fate of France? When Marx expressed the opinion that
    the Paris Commune had committed a mistake in failing to seize the
    bank, which belonged to the whole of France,<a id="bk05"
    href="#fw05" name="bk05"><sup class="enote">[5]</sup></a> did he
    not proceed from the principles and practice of &#8220;pure
    democracy&#8221;?</p>

    <p>In actual fact, it is obvious that Kautsky is writing in a
    country where the police forbid people to laugh &#8220;in
    crowds,&#8221; otherwise Kautsky would have been killed by
    ridicule.</p>

    <p>Thirdly, I would respectfully remind Mr. Kautsky, who has Marx
    and Engels off pat, of the following appraisal of the Paris
    Commune given by Engels from the point of view of . . . &#8220;pure
    democracy&#8221;:</p>

    <p>&#8220;Have these gentlemen&#8221; (the anti-authoritarians)
    &#8220;ever seen a revolution? A revolution is certainly the most
    authoritarian thing there is; it is an act whereby one part of the
    population imposes its will upon the other by means of rifles,
    bayonets and cannon&#8212;all of which are highly authoritarian
    means. And the victorious party must maintain its rule by means of
    the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionaries. Would the
    Paris Commune have lasted more than a day if it had not used the
    authority of the armed people against the bourgeoisie? Cannot we,
    on the contrary, blame it for having made too little use of that
    authority?&#8221;<a id="bk06" href="#fw06" name="bk06"><sup
    class="enote">[6]</sup></a> </p>

    <p>Here is your &#8220;pure democracy&#8221;! How Engels would
    have ridiculed the vulgar petty bourgeois, the
    &#8220;Social-Democrat&#8221; (in the French sense of the forties
    and the general European sense of 1914&ndash;18), who took it into his
    head to talk about &#8220;pure democracy&#8221; in a class-divided
    society!</p>

    <p>But that&#8217;s enough. It is impossible to enumerate all
    Kautsky&#8217;s various absurdities, since every phrase he utters
    is a bottomless pit of apostasy.</p>

    <p>Marx and Engels analysed the Paris Commune in a most detailed
    manner and showed that its merit lay in its attempt <em>to smash</em>,
    <em>to break up</em> the &#8220;ready-made state
    machinery&#8221;. Marx and Engels considered this conclusion to be
    so important that this was the only amendment they introduced in
    1872 into the &#8220;obsolete&#8221; (in parts) programme of the
    <a
    href="../../../../marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm"><em>Communist
    Manifesto</em></a>.<a id="bk07" href="#fw07" name="bk07"><sup
    class="enote">[7]</sup></a> Marx and Engels showed that the Paris
    Commune had abolished the army and the bureaucracy, had abolished
    <em>parliamentarism</em>, had destroyed &#8220;that parasitic
    excrescence, the state,&#8221; etc. But the sage Kautsky, donning
    his nightcap, repeats the fairy-tale about &#8220;pure
    democracy,&#8221; which has been told a thousand times by liberal
    professors.</p>

    <p>No wonder Rosa Luxemburg declared, on August 4, 1914, that
    German Social-Democracy was a <em>stinking corpse.</em></p>

    <p>Third subterfuge. &#8220;When we speak of the dictatorship as a
    form of government we cannot speak of the dictatorship of a class,
    since a class, as we have already pointed out, can only rule but
    not govern. . . .&#8221; It is &#8220;organisations&#8221; or
    &#8220;parties&#8221; that govern.</p>

    <p>That is a muddle, a disgusting muddle, Mr. &#8220;Muddleheaded
    Counsellor&#8221;! Dictatorship is not a &#8220;form of government&#8221;;
    that is ridiculous nonsense. And Marx does not speak of the
    &#8220;form of government&#8221; but of the form or type of
    <em>state.</em> That is something altogether different, entirely
    different. It is altogether wrong, too, to say that a class cannot
    govern: such an absurdity could only have been uttered by a
    &#8220;parliamentary cretin,&#8221; who sees nothing but bourgeois
    parliaments and notices nothing but &#8220;ruling
    parties&#8221;. Any European country will provide Kautsky with
    examples of government by a ruling <em>class</em>, for instance, by the
    landowners in the Middle Ages, in spite of their insufficient
    organisation.</p>

    <p>To sum up: Kautsky has in a most unparalleled manner distorted
    the concept dictatorship of the proletariat, and has turned Marx
    into a common liberal; that is, he himself has sunk to the level
    of a liberal who utters banal phrases about &#8220;pure
    democracy,&#8221; embellishing and glossing over the class content
    of <em>bourgeois</em> democracy, and shrinking, above all, from
    the use of <em>revolutionary violence</em> by the oppressed
    class. By so &#8220;interpreting&#8221; the concept
    &#8220;revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat&#8221; as to
    expunge the revolutionary violence of the oppressed class against
    its oppressors, Kautsky has beaten the world record in the liberal
    distortion of Marx. The renegade Bernstein has proved to be a more
    puppy compared with the renegade Kautsky.</p>
