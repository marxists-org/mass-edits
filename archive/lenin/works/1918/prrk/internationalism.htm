    <h3>What Is Internationalism?</h3>

    <p class="fst">Kautsky is absolutely convinced that he is an
    internationalist and calls himself one. The Scheidemanns he calls
    &#8220;government socialists&#8221;. In defending the Mensheviks
    (he does not openly express his solidarity with them, but he
    faithfully expresses their views), Kautsky has shown with perfect
    clarity what kind of &#8220;internationalism&#8221; he subscribes
    to. And since Kautsky is not alone, but is spokesman for a trend
    which inevitably grew up in the atmosphere of the Second
    International (Longuet in France, Turati in Italy, Nobs and Grimm,
    Graber and Naine in Switzerland, Ramsay MacDonald in Britain,
    etc.), it will be instructive to dwell on Kautsky&#8217;s
    &#8220;internationalism&#8221;. 

    </p>
    <p>
      After emphasising that the
      Mensheviks also attended the Zimmerwald Conference (a diploma,
      certainly, but . . . a tainted one), Kautsky sets forth the views of
      the Mensheviks, with whom he agrees, in the following manner:</p>

    <p>&#8220;. . . The Mensheviks wanted a general peace. They wanted
    all the belligerents to adopt the formula: no annexations and no
    indemnities. Until this had been achieved, the Russian army,
    according to this view, was to stand ready for battle. The
    Bolsheviks, on the other hand, demanded an immediate peace at any
    price; they were prepared, if need be, to make a separate peace;
    they tried to force it by increasing the state of disorganisation
    of the army, which was already bad enough&#8221; (p. 27). In
    Kautsky&#8217;s opinion the Bolsheviks should not have taken
    power, and should have contented themselves with a Constituent
    Assembly.</p>

    <p>So, the internationalism of Kautsky and the Mensheviks amounts
    to this: to demand reforms from the imperialist bourgeois
    government, but to continue to support it, and to continue to
    support the war that this government is waging until everyone in
    the war has accepted the formula: no annexations and no
    indemnities. This view was repeatedly expressed by Turati, and by
    the Kautsky supporters (Haase and others), and by Longuet and Co.,
    who declared that they stood <em>for</em> defence of the
    fatherland.</p>

    <p>Theoretically, this shows a complete inability to dissociate
    oneself from the social-chauvinists and complete confusion
    on the question of defence of the fatherland.  Politically, it
    means substituting petty-bourgeois nationalism for
    internationalism, deserting to the reformists&#8217; camp and
    renouncing revolution.</p>

    <p>From the point of view of the proletariat, recognising
    &#8220;defence of the fatherland&#8221; means justifying the
    present war, admitting that it is legitimate. And since the war
    remains an imperialist war (both under a monarchy and under a
    republic), irrespective of the country&#8212;mine or some other
    country&#8212;in which the enemy troops are stationed at the given
    moment, recognising defence of the fatherland means, <em>in
    fact</em>, supporting the imperialist, predatory bourgeoisie, and
    completely betraying socialism. In Russia, even under Kerensky,
    under the bourgeois-democratic republic, the war continued
    to be imperialist war, for it was being waged by the bourgeoisie
    as a ruling class (and war is a &#8220;continuation of
    politics&#8221;); and a particularly striking expression of the
    imperialist character of the war were the secret treaties for the
    partitioning of the world and the plunder of other countries which
    had been concluded by the tsar at the time with the capitalists of
    Britain and France.</p>

    <p>The Mensheviks deceived the people in a most despicable manner
    by calling this war a defensive or revolutionary war. And by
    approving the policy of the Mensheviks, Kautsky is approving the
    popular deception, is approving the part played by the petty
    bourgeoisie in helping capital to trick the workers and harness
    them to the chariot of the imperialists.  Kautsky is pursuing a
    characteristically petty-bourgeois, philistine policy by
    pretending (and trying to make the people believe the absurd idea)
    that <em>putting forward a slogan</em> alters the position. The
    entire history of bourgeois democracy refutes this illusion; the
    bourgeois democrats have always advanced all sorts of
    &#8220;slogans&#8221; to deceive the people. The point is to
    <em>test</em> their sincerity, to compare their words with their
    <em>deeds,</em> not to be satisfied with idealistic or charlatan
    <em>phrases,</em> but to get down to <em>class reality.</em> An
    imperialist war does not cease to be imperialist when charlatans
    or phrase-mongers or petty-bourgeois philistines put
    forward sentimental &#8220;slogans&#8221;, but only when the class
    which is conducting the imperialist war, and is bound to it by
    millions of economic threads (and even ropes), is really
    <em>overthrown</em> and is replaced at the helm of state by the
    really revolutionary class, the proletariat. There is no other way
    <em>of getting out of an imperialist war, as also out of an
    imperialist predatory peace</em>. 

    </p>
    <p>
      By approving the foreign policy
      of the Mensheviks, and by declaring it to be internationalist and
      Zimmerwaldist, Kautsky, first, reveals the utter rottenness of the
      opportunist Zimmerwald majority (no wonder we, the <a
							    href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/z/i.htm#zimmerwald-left"><em>Left</em>
	Zimmerwaldists</a>, at once dissociated ourselves from such a
      majority!), and, secondly&#8212;and this is the chief thing&#8212;passes
      from the position of the proletariat to the position of the petty
      bourgeoisie, from the revolutionary to the reformist.</p>

    <p>The proletariat fights for the revolutionary overthrow of the
    imperialist bourgeoisie; the petty bourgeoisie fights for the
    reformist &#8220;improvement&#8221; of imperialism, for adaptation
    to it, while <em>submitting</em> to it. When Kautsky was still a
    Marxist, for example, in 1909, when he wrote his <em>Road to
    Power</em>, it was the idea that war would inevitably lead to
    <em>revolution</em> that he advocated, and he spoke of the
    approach of an <em>era of revolutions.</em> The Basle Manifesto of
    1912 plainly and definitely speaks of a <em>proletarian
    revolution</em> in connection with that very imperialist war
    between the German and the British groups which actually broke out
    in 1914. But in 1918, when revolutions did begin in connection
    with the war, Kautsky, instead of explaining that they were
    inevitable, instead of pondering over and thinking out the
    <em>revolutionary</em> tactics and the ways and means of preparing
    for revolution, began to describe the reformist tactics of the
    Mensheviks as internationalism. Isn&#8217;t this apostasy?</p>

    <p>Kautsky praises the Mensheviks for having insisted on
    maintaining the fighting strength of the army, and he blames the
    Bolsheviks for having added to &#8220;disorganisation of the
    army&#8221;, which was already disorganised enough as it was. This
    means praising reformism and submission to the imperialist
    bourgeoisie, and blaming and renouncing revolution. For under
    Kerensky maintaining the fighting strength of the army meant its
    preservation under <em>bourgeois</em> (albeit republican)
    command. Everybody knows, and the progress of events has
    strikingly confirmed it, that this republican army preserved
    the <em>Kornilov</em> spirit because its officers were Kornilov
    men. The bourgeois officers could not help being Kornilov men;
    they could not help gravitating towards imperialism and towards
    the forcible suppression of the proletariat. All that the
    Menshevik tactics amounted to <em>in practice</em> was to leave
    all the foundations of the imperialist war and all the foundations
    of the bourgeois dictatorship intact, to patch up details
    and to daub over a few trifles (&#8220;reforms&#8221;). 

    </p>
    <p>
      On the
      other hand, not a single great revolution has ever taken place, or
      ever can take place, without the &#8220;disorganisation&#8221; of
      the army. For the army is the most ossified instrument for
      supporting the old regime, the most hardened bulwark of bourgeois
      discipline, buttressing up the rule of capital, and preserving and
      fostering among the working people the servile spirit of
      submission and subjection to capital.  Counter-revolution
      has never tolerated, and never could tolerate, armed workers side
      by side with the army. In France, Engels wrote, the workers
      emerged armed from every revolution: &#8220;therefore, the
      disarming of the workers was the first commandment for the
      bourgeoisie, who were at the helm of the state.&#8221; <a
								id="bk30" href="#fw30" name="bk30"><sup
													class="enote">[30]</sup></a> The armed workers were the embryo of
      a <em>new</em> army, the organised nucleus of a <em>new</em>
      social order. The first commandment of the bourgeoisie was to
      crush this nucleus and prevent it from growing. The first
      commandment of every victorious revolution, as Marx and Engels
      repeatedly emphasised, was to smash the old army, dissolve it and
      replace it by a new one.<a id="bk31" href="#fw31" name="bk31"><sup
									 class="enote">[31]</sup></a> A new social class, when rising to
      power, never could, and cannot now, attain power and consolidate
      it except by completely disintegrating the old army
      (&#8220;Disorganisation!&#8221; the reactionary or just cowardly
      philistines howl on this score), except by passing through a most
      difficult and painful period without any army (the great French
      Revolution also passed through such a painful period), and by
      gradually building up, in the midst of hard civil war, a new army,
      a new discipline, a new military organisation of the new
      class. Formerly, Kautsky the historian understood this. Now,
      Kautsky the renegade has forgotten it.</p>

    <p>What right has Kautsky to call the Scheidemanns
    &#8220;government socialists&#8221; if he <em>approves</em> of the
    tactics of the Mensheviks in the Russian revolution? In supporting
    Kerensky and joining his Ministry, the Mensheviks were also
    government socialists. Kautsky could not escape this conclusion if
    he were to put the question as to which is the <em>ruling
    class</em> that is waging the imperialist war. But Kautsky avoids
    raising the question about the ruling class, a question that is
    imperative for a Marxist, for the mere raising of it would expose
    the renegade.</p>

    <p>The Kautsky supporters in Germany, the Longuet supporters in
    France, and Turati and Co. in Italy argue in this way: socialism
    presupposes the equality and freedom of nations, their
    self-determination, <em>hence</em>, when our country is
    attacked, or when enemy troops invade our territory, it is the
    right and duty of socialists to defend their country. But
    theoretically such an argument is either a sheer mockery of
    socialism or a fraudulent subterfuge, while from the point of view
    of practical politics it coincides with the argument of the quite
    ignorant country yokel who has even no conception of the social,
    class character of the war, and of the tasks of a revolutionary
    party during a reactionary war.</p>

    <p>Socialism is opposed to violence against nations. That is
    indisputable. But socialism is opposed to violence against men in
    general. Apart from Christian anarchists and Tolstoyans, however,
    no one has yet drawn the conclusion from this that socialism is
    opposed to <em>revolutionary</em> violence. So, to talk about
    &#8220;violence&#8221; in general, without examining the
    conditions which distinguish reactionary from revolutionary
    violence, means being a philistine who renounces revolution, or
    else it means simply deceiving oneself and others by
    sophistry.</p>

    <p>The same holds true of violence against nations. Every war is
    violence against nations, but that does not prevent socialists
    from being <em>in favour</em> of a revolutionary war.  The class
    character of war&#8212;that is the fundamental question which
    confronts a socialist (if he is not a renegade). The imperialist
    war of 1914&ndash;18 is a war between two groups of the
    imperialist bourgeoisie for the division of the world, for the
    division of the booty, and for the plunder and strangulation of
    small and weak nations. This was the appraisal of the impending
    war given in the Basle Manifesto in 1912, and it has been
    confirmed by the facts. Whoever departs from this view of war is
    not a socialist.</p>

    <p>If a German under Wilhelm or a Frenchman under Clemenceau says,
    &#8220;It is my right and duty as a socialist to defend my country
    if it is invaded by an enemy&#8221;, he argues not like a
    socialist, not like an internationalist, not like a revolutionary
    proletarian, but like a <em>petty-bourgeois
    nationalist.</em> Because this argument ignores the revolutionary
    class struggle of the workers against capital, it ignores the
    appraisal of the war as a <em>whole</em> from the point of view of
    the world bourgeoisie and the world proletariat, that is, it
    ignores internationalism, and all that remains is miserable and
    narrow-minded nationalism. My country is being wronged, that
    is all I care about&#8212;that is what this argument amounts to,
    and that is where its petty-bourgeois, nationalist
    narrow-mindedness lies. It is the same as if in regard to
    individual violence, violence against an individual, one were to
    argue that socialism is opposed to violence and therefore I would
    rather be a traitor than go to prison.</p>

    <p>The Frenchman, German or Italian who says: &#8220;Socialism is
    opposed to violence against nations, <em>therefore</em> I defend
    myself when my country is invaded&#8221;, <em>betrays</em>
    socialism and internationalism, because such a man <em>sees
    only</em> his own &#8220;country&#8221;, he puts &#8220;his
    own&#8221; . . . <em>bourgeoisie</em> above everything else and does
    not give a thought to the <em>international connections</em> which
    make the war an imperialist war and <em>his</em> bourgeoisie a link in the
    chain of imperialist plunder.</p>

    <p>All philistines and all stupid and ignorant yokels argue in the
    same way as the renegade Kautsky supporters, Longuet supporters,
    Turati and Co.: &#8220;The enemy has invaded my country, I
    don&#8217;t care about anything else.<a id="bk32" href="#fw32"
    name="bk32"><sup class="enote">[32]</sup></a></p>

    <p>The socialist, the revolutionary proletarian, the
    internationalist, argues differently. He says: &#8220;The
    character of the war (whether it is reactionary or revolutionary)
    does not depend on who the attacker was, or in whose country the
    &#8216;enemy&#8217; is stationed; it depends on <em>what
    class</em> is waging the war, and on what politics this war is a
    continuation of. If the war is a reactionary, imperialist war,
    that is, if it is being waged by two world groups of the
    imperialist, rapacious, predatory, reactionary bourgeoisie, then
    every bourgeoisie (even of the smallest country) becomes a
    participant in the plunder, and my duty as a representative of the
    revolutionary proletariat is to prepare for the <em>world
    proletarian revolution</em> as the <em>only</em> escape from the
    horrors of a world slaughter. I must argue, not from the point of
    view of &#8216;my&#8217; country (for that is the argument of a
    wretched, stupid, petty-bourgeois nationalist who does not
    realise that he is only a plaything in the hands of the
    imperialist bourgeoisie), but from the point of view of <em>my share</em>
    in the preparation, in the propaganda, and in the acceleration of
    the world proletarian revolution.&#8221;</p>

    <p>That is what internationalism means, and that is the duty of
    the internationalist, the revolutionary worker, the genuine
    socialist. That is the <em>ABC</em> that Kautsky the renegade has
    &#8220;forgotten&#8221;. And his apostasy becomes still more
    obvious when he passes from approving the tactics of the
    petty-bourgeois nationalists (the Mensheviks in Russia, the
    Longuet supporters in France, the Turatis in Italy, and Haase and
    Co. in Germany) to criticising the Bolshevik tactics. Here is his
    criticism:</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;The Bolshevik revolution was based on the
    assumption that it would become the starting-point of a
    general European revolution, that the bold initiative of Russia
    would prompt the proletarians of all Europe to rise.</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;On this assumption it was, of course,
    immaterial what forms the Russian separate peace would take, what
    hardships and territorial losses (literally: mutilation or
    maiming, <em>Verst&#252;mmelungen</em>) it would cause the
    Russian people, and what interpretation of the
    self-determination of nations it would give. At that time it
    was also immaterial whether Russia was able to defend herself or
    not. According to this view, the European revolution would be the
    best protection of the Russian revolution, and would bring
    complete and genuine self-determination to all peoples
    inhabiting the former Russian territory.</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;A revolution in Europe, which would
    establish and consolidate socialism there, would also become the
    means of removing the obstacles that would arise in Russia in the
    way of the introduction of the socialist system of production
    owing to the economic backwardness of the country.</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;All this was very logical and very
    sound&#8212;only if the main assumption were granted, namely,
    that the Russian revolution would infallibly let loose a European
    revolution. But what if that did not happen?</p>

    <p class="quote">&#8220;So far the assumption has not been
    justified. And the proletarians of Europe are now being accused of
    having abandoned and betrayed the Russian revolution. This is an
    accusation levelled against unknown persons, for who is to be held
    responsible for the behaviour of the European proletariat?&#8221;
    (P. 28.)</p>

    <p>And Kautsky then goes on to explain at great length that Marx,
    Engels and Bebel were more than once mistaken about the advent of
    revolution they had anticipated, but that they never based their
    tactics on the expectation of a revolution &#8220;<em>at a definite
    date</em>&#8221; (p.  29), whereas, he says, the Bolsheviks
    &#8220;staked everything on one card, on a general European
    revolution&#8221;.</p>

    <p>We have deliberately quoted this long passage to demonstrate to
    our readers Kautsky&#8217;s &#8220;skill&#8221; in counterfeiting
    Marxism by palming off his banal and reactionary philistine view
    in its stead.</p>

    <p>First, to ascribe to an opponent an obviously stupid idea and
    then to refute it is a trick practised by none too clever
    people. If the Bolsheviks had based their tactics on the
    expectation of a revolution in other countries <em>by a definite date</em>
    that would have been an undeniable stupidity. But the Bolshevik
    Party has never been guilty of such stupidity. In my letter to
    American workers (August 20, 1918), I expressly disown this
    foolish idea by saying that we count on an American revolution,
    but not by any definite date. I dwelt at length upon the very same
    idea more than once in my controversy with the Left
    Socialist-Revolutionaries and the &#8220;Left
    Communists&#8221; (January&ndash;March 1918). Kautsky has
    committed a slight . . . just a very slight forgery, on which he in
    fact based his criticism of Bolshevism. Kautsky has confused
    tactics based on the expectation of a European revolution in the
    more or less near future, but not at a definite date, with tactics
    based on the expectation of a European revolution at a definite
    date. A slight, just a very slight forgery!</p>

    <p>The last-named tactics are foolish. The first-named
    <em>are obligatory</em> for a Marxist, for every revolutionary proletarian
    and internationalist&#8212;<em>obligatory</em>, because they alone take
    into account in a proper Marxist way the objective situation
    brought about by the war in all European countries, and they alone
    conform to the international tasks of the proletariat.</p>

    <p>By substituting the petty question about an error which the
    Bolshevik revolutionaries might have made, but did not, for the
    important question of the foundations of revolutionary tactics in
    general, Kautsky adroitly abjures all revolutionary tactics!</p>

    <p>A renegade in politics, he is <em>unable even to present the
    question</em> of the objective prerequisites of revolutionary
    tactics theoretically.</p>

    <p>And this brings us to the second point.</p>

    <p>Secondly, it is obligatory for a Marxist to count on a European
    revolution if a <em>revolutionary situation</em> exists. It is the
    <em>ABC</em> of Marxism that the tactics of the socialist proletariat
    cannot be the same both when there is a revolutionary situation
    and when there is no revolutionary situation.</p>

    <p>If Kautsky had put this question, which is obligatory for a
    Marxist, he would have seen that the answer was absolutely
    against him. Long before the war, all Marxists, all socialists
    were agreed that a European war would create a revolutionary
    situation. Kautsky himself, before he became a renegade, clearly
    and definitely recognised this&#8212;in 1902 (in his <em>Social
    Revolution</em>) and in 1909 (in his <em>Road to Power</em>). It
    was also admitted in the name of the entire Second International
    in the Basle Manifesto. No wonder the social-chauvinists
    and Kautsky supporters (the &#8220;Centrists&#8221;, i.e., those
    who waver between the revolutionaries and the opportunists) of all
    countries shun like the plague the declarations of the Basle
    Manifesto on this score!</p>

    <p>So, the expectation of a revolutionary situation in Europe was
    not an infatuation of the Bolsheviks, but the <em>general
    opinion</em> of all Marxists. When Kautsky tries to escape from
    this indisputable truth using such phrases as the Bolsheviks
    &#8220;always believed in the omnipotence of violence and
    will&#8221;, he simply utters a sonorous and empty phrase to <em>cover
    up</em> his evasion, a shameful evasion, to put the question of a
    revolutionary situation.</p>

    <p>To proceed. Has a revolutionary situation actually come or not?
    Kautsky proved unable to put this question either. The economic
    facts provide an answer: the famine and ruin created everywhere by
    the war imply a revolutionary situation. The political facts also
    provide an answer: ever since 1915 a splitting process has been
    evident in <em>all</em> countries within the old and decayed
    socialist parties, a process of <em>departure of the mass</em> of
    the proletariat from the social-chauvinist leaders to the left, to
    revolutionary ideas and sentiments, to revolutionary leaders.</p>

    <p>Only a person who dreads revolution and betrays it could have
    failed to see these facts on August 5, 1918, when Kautsky was
    writing his pamphlet. And now, at the end of October 1918, the
    revolution is growing <em>in a number</em> of European countries,
    and growing under everybody&#8217;s eyes and very rapidly at
    that. Kautsky the &#8220;revolutionary&#8221;, who still wants to
    be regarded as a Marxist, has proved to be a short-sighted
    philistine, who, like those philistines of 1847 whom Marx
    ridiculed, failed to see the approaching revolution!</p>

    <p>Now to the third point.</p>

    <p>Thirdly, what should be the specific features of revolutionary
    tactics when there is a revolutionary situation in Europe? Having
    become a renegade, Kautsky feared to put this question, which is
    obligatory for a Marxist. Kautsky argues like a typical petty
    bourgeois, a philistine, or like an ignorant peasant: has a
    &#8220;general European revolution&#8221; begun or not? If it has,
    then <em>he too</em> is prepared to become a revolutionary! But
    then, mark you, every scoundrel (like the scoundrels who now
    sometimes attach themselves to the victorious Bolsheviks) would
    proclaim himself a revolutionary!</p>

    <p>If it has not, then Kautsky will turn his back on revolution!
    Kautsky does not display a shade of understanding of the truth
    that a revolutionary Marxist differs from the philistine and
    petty bourgeois by his ability to <em>preach</em> to the
    uneducated masses that the maturing revolution is necessary, to
    <em>prove</em> that it is inevitable, to <em>explain</em> its
    benefits to the people, and to <em>prepare</em> the proletariat
    and all the working and exploited people for it.</p>

    <p>Kautsky ascribed to the Bolsheviks an absurdity, namely, that
    they had staked everything on one card, on a European revolution
    breaking out at a definite date. This absurdity has turned against
    Kautsky himself, because the logical conclusion of his argument is
    that the tactics of the Bolsheviks would have been correct if a
    European revolution had broken out by August 5, 1918! That is the
    date Kautsky mentions as the time he was writing his pamphlet.
    And when, a few weeks after this August 5, it became clear that
    revolution was coming in a number of European countries, the whole
    apostasy of Kautsky, his whole falsification of Marxism, and his
    utter inability to reason or even to present questions in a
    revolutionary manner, became revealed in all their charm!</p>

    <p>When the proletarians of Europe are accused of treachery,
    Kautsky writes, it is an accusation levelled at unknown
    persons.</p>

    <p>You are mistaken, Mr. Kautsky! Look in the mirror and you will
    see those &#8220;unknown persons&#8221; against whom this
    accusation is levelled. Kautsky assumes an air of
    na&#239;vet&#233; and pretends not to understand <em>who</em>
    levelled the accusation, and its <em>meaning.</em> In reality,
    however, Kautsky knows perfectly well that the accusation has
    been and is being levelled by the German &#8220;Lefts&#8221;, by
    the <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/s/p.htm#spartacus-league">Spartacists,</a>
    by <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/people/l/i.htm#liebknecht">Liebknecht</a>
    and his friends.  This accusation expresses a <em>clear
    appreciation</em> of the fact that the German proletariat betrayed the
    Russian (and world) revolution when it strangled Finland, the
    Ukraine, Latvia and Estonia. This accusation is levelled primarily
    and above all, not against the <em>masses</em>, who are always
    downtrodden, but against those <em>leaders</em> who, like the <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/people/s/c.htm#scheidemann">Scheidemanns</a>
    and the Kautskys, <em>failed</em> in their duty to carry on
    revolutionary agitation, revolutionary propaganda, revolutionary
    work among the masses to overcome their inertness, who in fact
    worked <em>against</em> the revolutionary instincts and
    aspirations which are always aglow deep down among the mass of the
    oppressed class. The Scheidemanns bluntly, crudely, cynically, and
    in most cases for selfish motives betrayed the proletariat and
    deserted to the side of the bourgeoisie. The Kautsky and the
    Longuet supporters did the same thing, only hesitatingly and
    haltingly, and casting cowardly side-glances at those who were
    stronger at the moment. In all his writings during the war Kautsky
    tried to <em>extinguish</em> the revolutionary spirit instead of
    fostering and fanning it.</p>

    <p>The fact that Kautsky does not even understand the enormous
    <em>theoretical</em> importance, and the even greater agitational
    and propaganda importance, of the &#8220;accusation&#8221; that
    the proletarians of Europe have betrayed the Russian revolution
    will remain a veritable historical monument to the philistine
    stupefaction of the &#8220;average&#8221; leader of German
    official Social-Democracy! Kautsky does not understand that, owing
    to the censorship prevailing in the German &#8220;Reich&#8221;,
    this &#8220;accusation&#8221; is perhaps the only form in which
    the German socialists who have not betrayed socialism&#8212;Liebknecht
    and his friends&#8212;can express <em>their appeal to the German
    workers</em> to throw off the Scheidemanns and the
    Kautskys, to push aside such &#8220;leaders&#8221;, to free
    themselves from their stultifying and debasing propaganda, to rise
    in revolt <em>in spite of</em> them, <em>without</em> them, and
    march over their heads <em>towards revolution</em>!</p>

    <p>Kautsky does not understand this. And how could he understand
    the tactics of the Bolsheviks? Can a man who renounces revolution
    in general be expected to weigh and appraise the conditions of the
    development of revolution in one of the most
    &#8220;difficult&#8221; cases?</p>

    <p>The Bolsheviks&#8217; tactics were correct; they were the
    <em>only</em> internationalist tactics, because they were based,
    not on the cowardly fear of a world revolution, not on a
    philistine &#8220;lack of faith&#8221; in it, not on the narrow
    nationalist desire to protect one&#8217;s &#8220;own&#8221;
    fatherland (the fatherland of one&#8217;s own bourgeoisie), while
    not &#8220;giving a damn&#8221; about all the rest, but on a
    correct (and, before the war and before the apostasy of the
    social-chauvinists and social-pacifists, a universally accepted)
    <em>estimation</em> of the revolutionary situation in
    Europe. These tactics were the only internationalist tactics,
    because they did the utmost possible in one country <em>for</em> the
    development, support and awakening of the revolution in <em>all
    countries</em>. These tactics have been justified by their
    enormous success, for Bolshevism (not by any means because of the
    merits of the Russian Bolsheviks, but because of the most profound
    sympathy of the <em>people</em> everywhere for tactics that are
    revolutionary in practice) has become <em>world</em> Bolshevism, has
    produced an idea, a theory, a programme and tactics which differ
    concretely and in practice from those of social-chauvinism and
    social-pacifism. Bolshevism <em>has given a coup de gr&#226;ce</em> to the
    old, decayed International of the Scheidemanns and Kautskys, <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/people/r/e.htm#pierre-renaudel">Renaudels</a>
    and Longuets, <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/people/h/e.htm#henderson-arthur">Hendersons</a>
    and <a
    href="../../../../../glossary/people/m/a.htm#macdonald-ramsay">MacDonalds</a>,
    who from now on will be treading on each other&#8217;s feet,
    dreaming about &#8220;unity&#8221; and trying to revive a
    corpse. Bolshevism <em>has created</em> the ideological and
    tactical foundations of a Third International, of a really
    proletarian and Communist International, which will take into
    consideration both the gains of the tranquil epoch and the
    experience of the <em>epoch of revolutions</em>, <em>which has
    begun</em>.</p>

    <p>Bolshevism has popularised throughout the world the idea of the
    &#8220;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8221;, has translated
    these words from the Latin, first into Russian, and then into
    <em>all</em> the languages of the world, and has shown by the
    example of <em>Soviet government</em> that the workers and poor
    peasants, <em>even</em> of a backward country, even with the least
    experience, education and habits of organisation, <em>have been
    able</em> for a whole year, amidst gigantic difficulties and
    amidst a struggle against the exploiters (who were supported by
    the bourgeoisie of the <em>whole</em> world), to maintain the
    power of the working people, to create a democracy that is
    immeasurably higher and broader than all previous democracies in
    the world, and to the creative work of tens of millions of workers
    and peasants for the practical construction of socialism.</p>

    <p>Bolshevism has actually helped to develop the proletarian
    revolution in Europe and America more powerfully than any party in
    any other country has so far succeeded in doing. While the workers
    of the whole world are realising more and more clearly every day
    that the tactics of the Scheidemanns and Kautskys have not
    delivered them from the imperialist war and from
    wage-slavery to the imperialist bourgeoisie, and that these
    tactics cannot serve as a model for all countries, the mass of
    workers in all countries are realising more and more clearly every
    day that Bolshevism has indicated the right road of escape from
    the horrors of war and imperialism, that Bolshevism <em>can serve
    as a model of tactics for all.</em> 

    </p>
    <p>
      Not only the general European,
      but the world proletarian revolution is maturing before the eyes
      of all, and it has been assisted, accelerated and supported by the
      victory of the proletariat in Russia. All this is not enough for
      the complete victory of socialism, you say? Of course it is not
      enough. One country alone cannot do more. But this one country,
      thanks to Soviet government, has done so much that even if Soviet
      government in Russia were to be crushed by world imperialism
      tomorrow, as a result, let us say, of an agreement between German
      and Anglo-French imperialism&#8212;even granted that very worst
      possibility&#8212;it would still be found that Bolshevik tactics
      have brought enormous benefit to socialism and have assisted the
      growth of the invincible world revolution.</p>

      The social-chauvinists (the Scheidemanns, Renaudels,
      Hendersons, Gomperses and Co.)  absolutely refuse to talk
      about the &#8220;International&#8221; during the war. They regard the
      enemies of &#8220;<em>their</em>&#8221; respective bourgeoisies as
      &#8220;traitors&#8221; to . . . socialism. They <em>support</em> the
      policy of conquest pursued by <em>their</em> respective
      bourgeoisies. The social-pacifists (i.e., socialists in
      words and petty-bourgeois pacifists in practice) express all
      sorts of &#8220;internationalist&#8221; sentiments, protest
      against annexations, etc., but <em>in practice</em> they continue
      to <em>support their</em> respective imperialist bourgeoisies. The
      difference between the two types is unimportant; it is like the
      difference between two capitalists&#8212;one with bitter, and the
      other with sweet, words on his lips.</p>
