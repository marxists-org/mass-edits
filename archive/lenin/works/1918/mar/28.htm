<h3>The International Position Of The Russian Soviet Republic And The
Fundamental Tasks Of The Socialist Revolution</h3>

<br>
<br>
<p>Thanks to the peace which has been achieved&#8212;despite its extremely
onerous character and extreme instability&#8212;the Russian Soviet Republic
has gained an opportunity to concentrate its efforts for a while on the
most important and most difficult aspect of the socialist revolution,
namely, the task of organisation.</p>
<p>This task was clearly and definitely set before all the working and
oppressed people in the fourth paragraph (Part 4) of the resolution
adopted at the <a href="../../1918/mar/13.htm" target="_blank" >Extraordinary Congress
of Soviets in Moscow</a> on March 15, 1918, in that paragraph (or part)
which speaks of the self-discipline of the working people and of the
ruthless struggle against chaos and disorganisation<span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">. </span><span
class="inote"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">[</span>See
also <a href="../../1918/mar/13.htm#toc4" target="_blank" >Resolution On Ratification
Of The
Brest Treaty</a><em>&#8212;Editor</em>.]</span></p>

<p>Of course, the peace achieved by the Russian Soviet Republic is
unstable not because she is now thinking of resuming military
operations; apart from bourgeois counter-revolutionaries and their
henchmen (the Mensheviks and others), no sane politician thinks of
doing that. The instability of the peace is due to the fact that in the
imperialist states bordering on Russia to the West and the East, which
command enormous military forces, the military party, tempted by
Russia&#8217;s momentary weakness and egged on by capitalists, who hate
socialism and are eager for plunder, may gain the upper hand at any
moment.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances the only real, not paper, guarantee of
peace we have is the antagonism among the imperialist powers, which has
reached extreme limits, and which is apparent on the one hand in the
resumption of the imperialist butchery of the peoples in the West, and
on the other hand in the extreme intensification of imperialist rivalry
between Japan and America for supremacy in the Pacific and on the
Pacific coast.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that with such an unreliable guard for
protection, our Soviet Socialist Republic is in an extremely unstable
and certainly critical international position. All our efforts must be
exerted to the very utmost to make use of the respite given us by the
combination of circumstances so that we can heal the very severe wounds
<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">inflicted </span>by
the war upon the entire social organism of Russia and bring about an
economic revival, without which a real increase in our country&#8217;s
defence potential is inconceivable.</p>
<p>It also goes without saying that we shall be able to render
effective assistance to the socialist revolution in the West which has
been delayed for a number of reasons, only to the extent that we are
able to fulfil the task of organisation confronting us.</p>
<p>A fundamental condition for the successful accomplishment of the
primary task of organisation confronting us is that the people&#8217;s
political leaders, i.e., the members of the Russian Communist Party
(Bolsheviks), and following them all the class-conscious
representatives of the mass of the working people, shall fully
appreciate the radical distinction in this respect between previous
bourgeois revolutions and the present socialist revolution.</p>
<p>In bourgeois revolutions, the principal task of the mass of working
people was to fulfil the negative or destructive work of abolishing
feudalism, monarchy and medievalism. The positive or constructive work
of organising the new society was carried out by the property-owning
bourgeois minority of the population. And the latter carried out this
task with relative ease, despite the resistance of the workers and the
poor peasants, not only because the resistance of the people exploited
by capital was then extremely weak, since they were scattered and
uneducated, but also because the chief organising force of anarchically
built capitalist society is the spontaneously growing and expanding
national and international market.</p>

<p>In every socialist revolution, however&#8212;and consequently in the
socialist revolution in Russia which we began on October 25, 1917&#8212;the
principal task of the proletariat, and of the poor peasants which it
leads, is the positive or constructive work of setting up an extremely
intricate and delicate system of new organisational relationships
extending to the planned production and distribution of the goods
required for the existence of tens of millions of people. Such a
revolution can be successfully carried out only if the majority of the
population, and primarily the majority of the working people, engage in
independent creative work as makers of history. Only if the proletariat
and the poor peasants display sufficient class-consciousness, devotion
to principle, self-sacrifice and perseverance, will the victory of the
socialist revolution be assured. By creating a new, Soviet type of
state, which gives the working and oppressed people the chance to take
an active part in the independent building up of a new society, we
solved only a small part of this difficult problem . The principal
difficulty lies in the economic sphere, namely, the introduction of the
strictest and universal accounting and control of the production and
distribution of goods, raising the productivity of labour and <em>socialising</em>
production <em>in practice</em>.</p>
<p>The development of the Bolshevik Party, which today is the governing
party in Russia, very strikingly indicates the nature of the
turning-point in history we have now reached, which is the peculiar
feature of the present political situation, and which calls for a new
orientation of Soviet power, i.e., for a new presentation of new tasks.</p>
<p>The first task of every party of the future is to convince, the
majority of the people that its programme and tactics are correct. This
task stood in the forefront both in tsarist times and in the period of
the Chernovs&#8217; and Tseretelis&#8217; policy of compromise with the Kerenskys
and Kishkins. This task has now been fulfilled in the main, for, as the
recent Congress of Soviets in Moscow incontrovertibly proved, the
majority of the workers and peasants of Russia are obviously on the
side of the Bolsheviks; but of course, it is far from being completely
fulfilled (and it can never be completely fulfilled).</p>

<p>The second task that confronted our Party was to capture political
power and to suppress the resistance of the exploiters. This task has
not been completely fulfilled either, and it cannot be ignored because
the monarchists and Constitutional-Democrats on the one hand, and their
henchmen and hangers-on, the Mensheviks and Right
Socialist-Revolutionaries, on the other, are continuing their efforts
to unite for the purpose of overthrowing Soviet power. In the main,
however, the task of suppressing the resistance of the exploiters was
fulfilled in the period from October 25, 1917, to (approximately)
February 1918, or to the surrender of Bogayevsky.<a id="bk2" href="#fw2"
name="bk2" target="_blank" ><sup class="enote">[2]</sup></a></p>
<p>A third task is now coming to the fore as the immediate task and one
which constitutes the peculiar feature of the present situation,
namely, the task of organising <em>administration</em> of Russia. Of
course, we advanced and tackled this task on the very day following
October 25, 1917. Up to now, however, since the resistance of the
exploiters still took the form of open civil war, up to now the task of
administration <em>could not</em> become the <em>main</em>, the <em>central</em>
task.</p>
<p>Now it has become the main and central task. We, the Bolshevik
Party, have <em>convinced</em> Russia. We have won Russia from the
rich for the poor, from the exploiters for the working people. Now we
must <em>administer</em> Russia. And the whole peculiarity of the
present situation, the whole difficulty, lies in understanding <em>the
specific features of the transition</em> from the principal task of
convincing the peopIe and of suppressing the exploiters by armed force
to the principal task of <em>administration</em>.</p>

<p>For the first time in human history a socialist party has managed to
complete in the main the conquest of power and the suppression of the
exploiters, and has managed to <em>approach directly</em> the task of <em>administration</em>.
We must prove worthy executors of this most difficult (and most
gratifying) task of the socialist revolution. We must <em>fully realise</em>
that in order to administer successfully, <em>besides</em> being able
to convince people, besides being able to win a civil war, we must be
able to do <em>practical organisational work</em>. This is the most
difficult task, because it is a matter of organising in a new way the
most deep-rooted, the economic, foundations of life of scores of
millions of people. And it is the most gratifying task, because only <em>after</em>
it has been fulfilled (in the principal and main outlines) will it be
possible to say that Russia <em>has become</em> not only a Soviet, but
also a socialist, republic.</p>

<a id="sec2" name="sec2" target="_blank" ></a>
<h3>The General Slogan Of The Moment</h3>
<p>The objective situation reviewed above, which has been created by
the extremely onerous and unstable peace, the terrible state of ruin,
the unemployment and famine we inherited from the war and the rule of
the bourgeoisie (represented by Kerensky and the Mensheviks and Right
Socialist-Revolutionaries who supported him), all this has inevitably
caused extreme weariness and even exhaustion of wide sections of the
working people. These people insistently demand&#8212;and cannot but demand&#8212;a
respite. The task of the day is to restore the productive forces
destroyed by the war and by bourgeois rule; to heal the wounds
inflicted by the war, by the defeat in the war, by profiteering and the
attempts of the bourgeoisie to restore the overthrown rule of the
exploiters; to achieve economic revival; to provide reliable protection
of elementary order. It may sound paradoxical, but in fact, considering
the objective conditions indicated above, it is absolutely certain that
at the present moment the Soviet system can secure Russia&#8217;s transition
to socialism only if these very elementary, extremely elementary
problems of maintaining public life are practically solved in spite of
the resistance of the bourgeoisie, the Mensheviks and the Right
Socialist-Revolutionaries. In view of the specific features of the
present situation, and in view of the existence of Soviet power with
its land socialisation law, workers&#8217; control law, etc., the practical
solution of these extremely elementary problems and the overcoming of
the organisational difficulties of the first stages of progress toward
socialism are now two aspects of the same picture.</p>
<p>Keep regular and honest accounts of money, manage economically, do
not be lazy, do not steal, observe the strictest labour discipline&#8212;it
is these slogans, justly scorned by the revolutionary proletariat when
the bourgeoisie used them to conceal its rule as an exploiting class,
that are now, since the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, becoming the
immediate and the principal slogans of the moment. On the one hand, the
practical application of these slogans by <em>the mass</em> of working
people is the <em>sole</em> condition for the salvation of a country
which has been tortured almost to death by the imperialist war and by
the imperialist robbers (headed by Kerensky); on the other hand, the
practical application of these slogans by the <em>Soviet</em> State,
by <em>its</em> methods, on the basis of <em>its</em> laws, is a
necessary and <em>sufficient</em> condition for the final victory of
socialism. This is precisely what those who contemptuously brush aside
the idea of putting such &#8220;hackneyed&#8221; and &#8220;trivial&#8221; slogans in the
forefront fail to understand. In a small-peasant country, which
overthrew tsarism only a year ago, and which liberated itself from the
Kerenskys less than six months ago, there has naturally remained not a
little of spontaneous anarchy, intensified by the brutality and
savagery that accompany every protracted and reactionary war, and there
has arisen a good deal of despair and aimless bitterness. And if we add
to this the provocative policy of the lackeys of the bourgeoisie (the
Mensheviks, the Right Socialist-Revolulionaries, etc.) it will become
perfectly clear what prolonged and persistent efforts must be exerted
by the best and the most class-conscious workers and peasants in order
to bring about a complete change in the mood of the people and to bring
them on to the proper path of steady and disciplined labour. Only such
a transition brought about by the mass of the poor (the proletarians
and semi-proletarians) can consummate the victory over the bourgeoisie
and particularly over the peasant bourgeoisie, more stubborn and
numerous.</p>

<a id="sec3" name="sec3" target="_blank" ></a>
<h3>The New Phase Of The <br>
Struggle Against The Bourgeoisie</h3>
<p>The bourgeoisie in our country has been conquered, but it has not
yet been uprooted, not yet destroyed, and not even utterly broken. That
is why we are faced with a new and higher form of struggle against the
bourgeoisie, the transition from the very simple task of further
expropriating the capitalists to the much more complicated and
difficult task of creating conditions in which it will be impossible
for the bourgeoisie to exist, or for a new bourgeoisie to arise. Clearl<span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">y,</span> this task is
immeasurably more significant than the previous one; and until it is
fulfilled there will be no socialism.</p>
<p>If we measure our revolution by the scale of West-European
revolutions we shall find that at the present moment we are
approximately at the level reached in 1793 and 1871. We can be
legitimately proud of having risen to this level, and of having
certainly, in one respect, advanced somewhat further, namely: we have
decreed and introduced through out Russia the highest <em>type</em> of
state&#8212;Soviet power. Under no circumstances, however, can we rest
content with what we have achieved, because we have only just started
the transition to socialism, we have <em>not yet</em> done the
decisive thing in <em>this</em> respect.</p>

<p>The decisive thing is the organisation of the strictest and
country-wide accounting and control of production and distribution of
goods. And yet, we have <em>not yet</em> introduced accounting and
control in those enterprises and in those branches and fields of
economy which we have taken away from the bourgeoisie; and without this
there can be no thought of achieving the second and equally essential
material condition for introducing socialism, namely, raising the
productivity of labour on a national scale.</p>
<p>That is why the present task could not be defined by the simple
formula: continue the offensive against capital. Although we have
certainly not finished off capital and although it is certainly
necessary to continue the offensive against this enemy of the working
people, such a formula would be inexact, would not be concrete, would
not take into account the <em>peculiarity</em> of the present
situation in which, in order to go on advancing successfully <em>in
the future</em>, we must &#8220;suspend&#8221; our offensive <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>This can be explained by comparing our position in the war against
capital with the position of a victorious army that has captured, say,
a half or two-thirds of the enemy&#8217;s territory and is compelled to halt
in order to muster its forces, to replenish its supplies of munitions,
repair and reinforce the lines of communication, build new storehouses,
bring up new reserves, etc. To suspend the offensive of a victorious
army under such conditions is necessary precisely in order to gain the
rest of the enemy&#8217;s territory, i.e., in order to achieve complete
victory. Those who have failed to understand that the objective state
of affairs at the present moment dictates to us precisely such a
&#8220;suspension&#8221; of the offensive against capital have failed to understand
anything at all about the present political situation.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that we can speak about the &#8220;suspension&#8221; of
the offensive against capital only in quotation marks, i.e., only
metaphorically. In ordinary war, a general order can be issued to stop
the offensive, the advance can actually be stopped. In the war against
capital, however, the advance cannot be stopped, and there can be no
thought of our abandoning the further expropriation of capital. What we
are discussing is the shifting of the <em>centre of gravity</em> of
our economic and political work. Up to now measures for the direct
expropriation of the expropriators were <em>in the forefront</em>. Now
the organisation of accounting and control in those enterprises in
which the capitalists have already been expropriated, and in all other
enterprises, advances <em>to the forefront</em>.</p>

<p>If we decided to continue to expropriate capital at the same rate at
which we have been doing it up to now, we should certainly suffer
defeat, because our work of organising proletarian accounting and
control has obviously&#8212; obviously to every thinking person&#8212;<em>fallen
behind</em> the work of <em>directly</em> &#8220;expropriating the
expropriators&#8221;. If we now concentrate all our efforts on the
organisation of accounting and control, we shall be able to solve this
problem, we shall be able to make up for lost time, we shall <em>completely</em>
win our &#8220;campaign&#8221; against capital.</p>

<p>But is not the admission that we must make up for lost time
tantamount to admission of some kind of an error? Not in the least.
Take another military example. If it is possible to defeat and push
back the enemy merely with detachments of light cavalry, it should be
done. But if this can be done successfully only up to a certain point,
then it is quite conceivable that when this point has been reached, it
will be necessary to bring up heavy artillery. By admitting that it is
now necessary to make up for lost time in bringing up heavy artillery,
we do not admit that the successful cavalry attack was a mistake.</p>
<p>Frequently, the lackeys of the bourgeoisie reproached us for having
launched a &#8220;Red Guard&#8221; attack on capital. The reproach is absurd and is
worthy only of the lackeys of the money-bags, because <em>at one time</em>
the &#8220;Red Guard&#8221; attack on capital was absolutely dictated by
circumstances. Firstly, <em>at that time</em> capital put up military
resistance through the medium of Kerensky and Krasnov, Savinkov and
Gotz (Gegechkori is putting up such resistance even now), Dutov and
Bogayevsky. Military resistance cannot be broken except by military
means, and the Red Guards fought in the noble and supreme historical
cause of liberating the working and exploited people from the yoke of
the exploiters.</p>
<p>Secondly, we could not at that time put methods of administration in
the forefront in place of methods of suppression, because the art of
administration is not innate, but is acquired by experience. At that
time we lacked this experience; now we have it. Thirdly, at that time
we could not have specialists in the various fields of knowledge and
technology at our disposal because those specialists were either
fighting in the ranks of the Bogayevskys, or were still able to put up
systematic and stubborn passive resistance by way of <em>sabotage</em>.
Now we have broken the sabotage. The &#8220;Red Guard&#8221; attack on capital was
successful, was victorious, because we broke capital&#8217;s military
resistance and its resistance by sabotage.</p>

<p>Does that mean that a &#8220;Red Guard&#8221; attack on capital is <em>always</em>
appropriate, under <em>all</em> circumstances, that we have <em>no</em>
other means of fighting capital? It would be childish to think so. We
achieved victory with the aid of light cavalry, but we also have heavy
artillery. We achieved victory by methods of suppression; we shall be
able to achieve victory also by methods of administration. We must know
how to change our methods of fighting the enemy to suit changes in the
situation. We shall not for a moment renounce &#8220;Red Guard&#8221; suppression
of the Savinkovs and Gegechkoris and all other landowner and bourgeois
counter-revolutionaries. We shall not be so foolish, however, as to put
&#8220;Red Guard&#8221; methods in the forefront at a time when the period in which
Red Guard attacks were necessary has, in the main, drawn to a close
(and to a victorious close), and when the period of utilising bourgeois
specialists by the proletarian state power for the purpose of
reploughing the soil in order to prevent the growth of any bourgeoisie
whatever is knocking at the door.</p>

<p>This is a peculiar epoch, or rather stage of development, and in
order to defeat capital completely, we must be able to adapt the forms
of our struggle to the peculiar conditions of this stage.</p>
<p>Without the guidance of experts in the various fields of knowledge,
technology and experience, the transition to socialism will be
impossible, because socialism calls for a conscious mass advance to
greater productivity of labour compared with capitalism, and on the
basis achieved by capitalism. Socialism must achieve this advance <em>in
its own way</em>, by its own methods&#8212;or, to put it more concretely, by
Soviet methods. And the specialists, because of the whole social
environment which made them specialists, are, in the main, inevitably
bourgeois. Had our proletariat, after capturing power, quickly solved
the problem of accounting, control and organisation on a national scale
(which was impossible owing to the war and Russia&#8217;s backwardness), then
we, after breaking the sabotage, would also have completely
subordinated these bourgeois experts to ourselves by means of universal
accounting and control. Owing to the considerable &#8220;delay&#8221; in
introducing accounting and control generally, we, although we have
managed to conquer sabotage, have <em>not yet</em> created the
conditions which would place the bourgeois specialists at our disposal.
The mass of saboteurs are &#8220;going to work&#8221;, but the best organisers and
the top experts can be utilised by the state either in the old way, in
the bourgeois way (i.e., for high salaries), or in the new way, in the
proletarian way (i.e., creating the conditions of national accounting
and control from below, which would inevitably and of itself
subordinate the experts and enlist them for our work).</p>
<p>Now we have to resort to the old bourgeois method and to agree to
pay a very high price for the &#8220;services&#8221; of the top bourgeois experts.
All those who are familiar with the subject appreciate this, but not
all ponder over the significance of this measure being adopted by the
proletarian state. Clearly, this measure is a compromise, a departure
from the principles of the Paris Commune and of every proletarian
power, which call for the reduction of all salaries to the level of the
wages of the average worker, which urge that careerism be fought not
merely in words, but in deeds.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is clear that this measure not only implies the
cessation&#8212;in a certain field and to a certain degree&#8212;of the offensive
against capital (for capital is not a sum of money, but a definite
social relation); it is also <em>a step backward</em> on the part of
our socialist Soviet state power, <a id="p249" name="p249" target="_blank" ></a>which
from the very outset proclaimed and pursued the policy of reducing high
salaries to the level of the wages of the average worker.<a id="bk3"
href="#fw3" name="bk3" target="_blank" ><sup class="enote">[3]</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, the lackeys of the bourgeoisie, particularly the small
fry, such as the Mensheviks, the <em>Novaya Zhizn</em> people and the
Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, will giggle over our confession that
we are taking a step backward. But we need not mind their giggling. We
must study the specific features of the extremely difficult and new
path to socialism without concealing our mistakes and weaknesses, and
try to be prompt in doing what has been left undone. To conceal from
the people the fact that the enlistment of bourgeois experts by means
of extremely high salaries is a retreat from the principles of the
Paris Commune would be sinking to the level of bourgeois politicians
and deceiving the people. Frankly explaining how and why we took this
step backward, and then publicly discussing what means are available
for making up for lost time, means educating the people and learning
from experience, learning together with the people how to build
socialism. There is hardly a single victorious military campaign in
history in which the victor did not commit certain mistakes, suffer
partial reverses, temporarily yield something and in some places
retreat. The &#8220;campaign&#8221; which we have undertaken against capitalism is
a million times more difficult than the most difficult military
campaign, and it would be silly and disgraceful to give way to
despondency because of a particular and partial retreat.</p>

<p>We shall now discuss the question from the practical point of view.
Let us assume that the Russian Soviet Republic requires one thousand
first-class scientists and experts in various fields of knowledge,
technology and practical experience to direct the labour of the people
towards securing the speediest possible economic revival. Let us assume
also that we shall have to pay these &#8220;stars of the first magnitude"&#8212;of
course the majority of those who shout loudest about the corruption of
the workers are themselves utterly corrupted by bourgeois morals&#8212;25,000
rubles per annum each. Let us assume that this sum (25,000,000 rubles)
will have to be doubled (assuming that we have to pay bonuses for
particularly successful and rapid fulfilment of the most important
organisational and technical tasks), or even quadrupled (assuming that
we have to enlist several hundred foreign specialists, who are more
demanding). The question is, would the annual expenditure of fifty or a
hundred million rubles by the Soviet Republic for the purpose of
reorganising the labour of the people on modern scientific and
technological lines be excessive or too heavy? Of course not. The
overwhelming majority of the class-conscious workers and peasants will
approve of this expenditure because they know from practical experience
that our backwardness causes us to lose thousands of millions, and that
we have <em>not yet</em> reached that degree of organisation,
accounting and control which would induce all the &#8220;stars&#8221; of the
bourgeois intelligentsia to participate voluntarily in <em>our</em>
work.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that this question has another side to it.
The corrupting influence of high salaries&#8212;both upon the Soviet
authorities (especially since the revolution occurred so rapidly that
it was impossible to prevent a certain number of adventurers and rogues
from getting into positions of authority, and they, together with a
number of inept or dishonest commissars, would not be averse to
becoming &#8220;star&#8221; embezzlers of state funds) and upon the mass of the
workers&#8212;is indisputable. Every thinking and honest worker and poor
peasant, however, will agree with us, will admit, that we cannot
immediately rid ourselves of the evil legacy of capitalism, and that we
can liberate the Soviet Republic from the duty of paying an annual

&#8220;tribute&#8221; of fifty million or one hundred million rubles (a tribute for
our own-backwardness in organising <em>country-wide</em> accounting
and control <em>from below</em> ) only by organising ourselves, by
tightening up discipline in our own ranks, by purging our ranks of all
those who are &#8220;preserving the legacy of capitalism&#8221;, who &#8220;follow the
traditions of capitalism&#8221;, i.e., of idlers, parasites and embezzlers of
statefunds (now all the land, all the factories and all the railways
are the &#8220;state funds&#8221; of the Soviet Republic). If the class-conscious
advanced workers and poor peasants manage with the aid of the Soviet
institutions to organise, become disciplined, pull themselves together,
create powerful labour discipline in the course of one year, then in a
year&#8217;s time we shall throw off this &#8220;tribute&#8221;, which can be reduced
even before that . . . in exact proportion to the successes we achieve
in our workers&#8217; and peasants&#8217; labour discipline and organisation. The
sooner we ourselves, workers and peasants, learn the best labour
discipline and the most modern technique of labour, using the bourgeois
experts to teach us, the sooner we shall liberate ourselves from any

&#8220;tribute&#8221; to these specialists.</p>
<p>Our work of organising country-wide accounting and control of
production and distribution under the supervision of the proletariat
has lagged very much behind our work of directly expropriating the
expropriators. This proposition is of fundamental importance for
understanding the specific features of the present situation and the
tasks of the Soviet government that follow from it. The centre of
gravity of our struggle against the bourgeoisie is shifting to the
organisation of such accounting and control. Only with this as our
starting-point will it be possible to determine correctly the immediate
tasks of economic and financial policy in the sphere of nationalisation
of the banks, monopolisation of foreign trade, the state control of
money circulation, the introduction of a property and income tax
satisfactory from the proletarian point of view, and the introduction
of compulsory labour service.</p>
<p>We have been lagging very far behind in introducing socialist
reforms in these spheres (very, very important spheres), and this is
because accounting and control are insufficiently organised in general.
It goes without saying that this is one of the most difficult tasks,
and in view of the ruin caused by the war, it can be fulfilled only
over a long period of time; but we must not forget that it is precisely
here that the bourgeoisie&#8212;and particularly the numerous petty and
peasant bourgeoisie&#8212;are putting up the most serious fight, disrupting
the control that is already being organised, disrupting the grain
monopoly, for example, and gaining positions for profiteering and
speculative trade. We have far from adequately carried out the things
we have decreed, and the principal task of the moment is to concentrate
all efforts on the businesslike, practical <em>realisation</em> of the
principles of the reforms which have already become law (but not yet
reality).</p>
<p>In order to proceed with the nationalisation of the banks and to go
on steadfastly towards transforming the banks into nodal points of
public accounting under socialism, we must first of all, and above all,
achieve real success in increasing the number of branches of the
People&#8217;s Bank, in attracting deposits, in simplifying the paying in and
withdrawal of deposits by the public, in abolishing queues, in catching
and <em>shooting</em> bribe-takers and rogues, etc. At first we must
really carry out the simplest things, properly organise what is
available, and then prepare for the more intricate things.</p>

<p>Consolidate and improve the state monopolies (in grain, leather,
etc.) which have already been introduced, and by doing so prepare for
the state monopoly of foreign trade. Without this monopoly we shall not
be able to &#8220;free ourselves&#8221; from foreign capital by paying &#8220;tribute&#8221;.<a
id="bk4" href="#fw4" name="bk4" target="_blank" ><sup class="enote">[4]</sup></a> And
the possibility of building up socialism depends entirely upon whether
we shall be able, by paying a certain tribute to foreign capital during
a certain transitional period, to safeguard our internal economic
independence.</p>
<p>We are also lagging very far behind in regard to the collection of
taxes generally, and of the property and income tax in particular. The
imposing of indemnities upon the bourgeoisie&#8212;a measure which in
principle is absolutely permissible and deserves proletarian
approval&#8212;shows that in this respect we are still nearer to the methods
of warfare (to win Russia from the rich for the poor) than to the
methods of administration. In order to become stronger, however, and in
order to be able to stand firmer on our feet, we must adopt the latter
methods, we must substitute for the indemnities imposed upon the
bourgeoisie the constant and regular collection of a property and
income tax, which will bring a <em>greater</em> return to the
proletarian state, and which calls for better organisation on our part
and better accounting and control.<a id="bk5" href="#fw5" name="bk5" target="_blank" ><sup
class="enote">[5]</sup></a></p>

<p>The fact that we are late in introducing compulsory labour service
also shows that the work that is coming to the fore at the present time
is precisely the preparatory organisational work that, on the one hand,
will finally consolidate our gains and that, on the other, is necessary
in order to prepare for the operation of &#8220;surrounding&#8221; capital and
compelling it to &#8220;surrender&#8221;. We ought to begin introducing compulsory
labour service immediately, but we must do so very gradually and
circumspectly, testing every step by practical experience, and, of
course, taking the first step by introducing compulsory labour service <em>for
the rich</em>. The introduction of work and consumers&#8217; budget books for
every bourgeois, including every rural bourgeois, would be an important
step towards completely &#8220;surrounding&#8221; the enemy and towards the
creation of a truly popular accounting and control of the production
and distribution of goods.</p>

<h3>The Significance Of The Struggle<br>

For Country-Wide Accounting And Control</h3>
<p>The state, which for centuries has been an organ for oppression and
robbery of the people, has left us a legacy of the people&#8217;s supreme
hatred and suspicion of everything that is connected with the state. It
is very difficult to overcome this, and only a Soviet government can do
it. Even a Soviet government, however, will require plenty of time and
enormous perseverance to accomplish it. This &#8220;legacy&#8221; is especially
apparent in the problem of accounting and control&#8212;the fundamental
problem facing the socialist revolution on the morrow of the overthrow
of the bourgeoisie. A certain amount of time will inevitably pass
before the people, who feel free for the first time now that the
landowners and the bourgeoisie have been overthrown, will
understand&#8212;not from books, but from their own, <em>Soviet</em>
experience&#8212;will understand and <em>feel</em> that without
comprehensive state accounting and control of the production and
distribution of goods, the power of the working people, the freedom of
the working people, <em>cannot</em> be maintained, and that a return
to the yoke of capitalism is <em>inevitable</em>.</p>

<p>All the habits and traditions of the bourgeoisie, and of the petty
bourgeoisie in particular, also oppose <em>state</em> control, and
uphold the inviolability of &#8220;sacred private property&#8221;, of &#8220;sacred&#8221;
private enterprise. It is now particularly clear to us how correct is
the Marxist thesis that anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism are <em>bourgeois</em>
trends, how irreconcilably opposed they are to socialism, proletarian
dictatorship and communism. The fight to instill into the people&#8217;s
minds the idea of <em>Soviet</em> state control and accounting, and to
carry out this idea in practice; the fight to break with the rotten
past, which taught the people to regard the procurement of bread and
clothes as a &#8220;private&#8221; affair, and buying and selling as a transaction

&#8220;which concerns only myself"&#8212;is a great fight of world-historic
significance, a fight between socialist consciousness and
bourgeois-anarchist spontaneity.</p>
<p>We have introduced workers&#8217; control as a law, but this law is only
just beginning to operate and is only just beginning to penetrate the
minds of broad sections of the proletariat. In our agitation we do not
sufficiently explain that lack of accounting and control in the
production and distribution of goods means the death of the rudiments
of socialism, means the embezzlement of state funds (for all property
belongs to the state and the state is the Soviet state in which power
belongs to the majority of the working people). We do not sufficiently
explain that carelessness in accounting and control is downright aiding
and abetting the German and the Russian Kornilovs, who can overthrow
the power of the working people <em>only</em> if we fail to cope with
the task of accounting and control, and who, with the aid of the whole
of the rural bourgeoisie, with the aid of the Constitutional-Democrats,
the Mensheviks and the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, are &#8220;watching&#8221;
us and waiting for an opportune moment to attack us. And the advanced
workers and peasants do not think and speak about this sufficiently.
Until workers&#8217; control has become a fact, until the advanced workers
have organised and carried out a victorious and ruthless crusade
against the violators of this control, or against those who are
careless in matters of control, it will be impossible to pass from the
first step (from workers&#8217; control) to the second step towards
socialism, i.e., to pass on to workers&#8217; regulation of production.</p>

<p>The socialist state can arise only as a network of producers&#8217; and
consumers&#8217; communes, which conscientiously keep account of their
production and consumption, economise on labour, and steadily raise the
productivity of labour, thus making it possible to reduce the working
day to seven, six and even fewer hours. Nothing will be achieved unless
the strictest, country-wide, comprehensive accounting and control of <em>grain</em>
and the <em>production of grain</em> (and later of all other essential
goods) are set going. Capitalism left us a legacy of mass organisations
which can facilitate our transition to the mass accounting and control
of the distribution of goods, namely, the consumers&#8217; co-operative
societies. In Russia these societies are not so well developed as in
the advanced countries, nevertheless, they have over ten million
members. The Decree on Consumers&#8217; Co-operative Societies,<a id="bk6"
href="#fw6" name="bk6" target="_blank" ><sup class="enote">[6]</sup></a> issued the
other day, is an extremely significant phenomenon, which strikingly
illustrates the peculiar position and the specific tasks of the Soviet
Socialist Republic at the present moment.</p>

<p>The decree is an agreement with the bourgeois co-operative societies
and the workers&#8217; co-operative societies which still adhere to the
bourgeois point of view. It is an agreement, or compromise, firstly
because the representatives of the above-mentioned institutions not
only took part in discussing the decree, but actually had a decisive
say in the matter, for the parts of the decree which were strongly
opposed by these institutions were dropped. Secondly, the essence of
the compromise is that the Soviet government has abandoned the
principle of admission of new members to co-operative societies without
entrance fees (which is the only consistently proletarian principle);
it has also abandoned the idea of uniting the whole population of a
given locality in a <em>single</em> co-operative society. Contrary to
this principle, which is the only socialist principle and which
corresponds to the task of abolishing classes, the &#8220;working-class
co-operative societies&#8221; (which in this case call themselves &#8220;class&#8221;
societies only because they subordinate themselves to the class
interests of the bourgeoisie) were given the right to continue to
exist. Finally, the Soviet government&#8217;s proposal to expel the
bourgeoisie entirely from the boards of the co-operative societies was
also considerably modified, and only owners of private capitalist
trading and industrial enterprises were forbidden to serve on the
boards.</p>
<p>Had the proletariat, acting through the Soviet government, managed
to organise accounting and control on a national scale, or at least
laid the foundation for such control, it would not have been necessary
to make such compromises. Through the food departments of the Soviets,
through the supply organisations under the Soviets we should have
organised the population into a single co-operative society under
proletarian management. We should have done this without the assistance
of the bourgeois co-operative societies, without making any concession
to the purely bourgeois principle which prompts the workers&#8217;
co-operative societies to remain workers&#8217; societies <em>side by side</em>

with bourgeois societies, <em>instead of</em> subordinating these
bourgeois co-operative societies entirely to themselves, merging the
two together and taking the <em>entire</em> management of the society
and the supervision of the consumption of the rich <em>in their own</em>
hands.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">concluding</span> such an
agreement with the bourgeois co-operative societies, the Soviet
government concretely defined its tactical aims and its peculiar
methods of action in the present stage of development as follows: by
directing the bourgeois elements, utilising them, making certain
partial concessions to them, we create the conditions for further
progress that will be slower than we at first anticipated, but surer,
with the base and lines of communication better secured and with the
positions which have been won better consolidated. The Soviets can (<em>and
should</em> ) now gauge their successes in the field of socialist
construction, among other things, by extremely clear, simple and
practical standards, namely, in how many communities (communes or
villages, or blocks of houses, etc.) co-operative societies have been
organised, and to what extent their development has reached the point
of embracing the whole population .</p>

<h3>Raising the Productivity of Labour</h3>
<p>In every socialist revolution, after the proletariat has solved the
problem of capturing power, and to the extent that the task of
expropriating the expropriators and suppressing their resistance has
been carried out in the main, there necessarily comes to the forefront
the fundamental task of creating a social system superior to
capitalism, namely, raising the productivity of labour, and in this
connection (and for this purpose) securing better organisation of
labour. Our Soviet state is precisely in the position where, thanks to
the victories over the exploiters&#8212;from Kerensky to Kornilov&#8212;it is able
to approach this task directly, to tackle it in earnest. And here it
becomes immediately clear that while it is possible to take over the
central government in a few days, while it is possible to suppress the
military resistance (and sabotage) of the exploiters even in different
parts of a great country in a few weeks, the capital solution of the
problem of raising the productivity of labour requires, at all events
(particularly after a most terrible and devastating war), several
years. The protracted nature of the work is certainly dictated by
objective circumstances.</p>
<p>The raising of the productivity of labour first of all requires that
the material basis of large-scale industry shall be assured, namely,
the development of the production of fuel, iron, the engineering and
chemical industries. The Russian Soviet Republic enjoys the favourable
position of having at its command, even after the Brest peace, enormous
reserves of ore (in the Urals), fuel in Western Siberia (coal), in the
Caucasus and the South-East (oil), in Central Russia (peat), enormous
timber reserves, water power, raw materials for the chemical industry
(Karabugaz), etc. The development of these natural resources by methods
of modern technology will provide the basis for the unprecedented
progress of the productive forces.</p>
<p>Another condition for raising the productivity of labour is,
firstly, the raising of the educational and cultural level of the mass
of the population. This is now taking place extremely rapidly, a fact
which those who are blinded by bourgeois routine are unable to see;
they are unable to understand what an urge towards enlightenment and
initiative is now developing among the &#8220;lower ranks&#8221; of the people
thanks to the Soviet form of organisation. Secondly, a condition for
economic revival is the raising of the working people&#8217;s discipline,
their skill, the effectiveness, the intensity of labour and its better
organisation.</p>
<p>In this respect the situation is particularly bad and even hopeless
if we are to believe those who have allowed themselves to be
intimidated by the bourgeoisie or by those who are serving the
bourgeoisie for their own ends. These people do not understand that
there has not been, nor could there be, a revolution in which the
supporters of the old system did not raise a howl about chaos, anarchy,
etc. naturally, among the people who have only just thrown off an
unprecedentedly savage yoke there is deep and widespread seething and
ferment; the working out of new principles of labour discipline by the
people is a very protracted process, and this process could not even
start until complete victory had been achieved over the landowners and
the bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>We, however, without in the least yielding to the despair (it is
often false despair) which is spread by the bourgeoisie and the
bourgeois intellectuals (who have despaired of retaining their old
privileges), must under no circumstances conceal an obvious evil. On
the contrary, we shall expose it and intensify the Soviet methods of
combating it, because the victory of socialism is inconceivable without
the victory of proletarian conscious discipline over spontaneous
petty-bourgeois anarchy, this real guarantee of a possible restoration
of Kerenskyism and Kornilovism.</p>
<p>The more class-conscious vanguard of the Russian proletariat has
already set itself the task of raising labour discipline. For example,
both the Central Committee of the Metalworkers&#8217; Union and the Central
Council of Trade Unions have begun to draft the necessary measures and
decrees.<a id="bk7" href="#fw7" name="bk7" target="_blank" ><sup class="enote">[7]</sup></a>This
work must be supported and pushed ahead with all speed. We must raise
the question of piece-work<a id="bk8" href="#fw8" name="bk8" target="_blank" ><sup
class="enote">[8]</sup></a> and apply and test it in practice; we must
raise the question of applying much of what is scientific and
progressive in the Taylor system; we must make wages correspond to the
total amount of goods turned out, or to the amount of work done by the
railways, the water transport system, etc., etc.</p>
<p>The Russian is a bad worker compared with people in advanced
countries. It could not be otherwise under the tsarist regime and in
view of the persistence of the hangover from serfdom. The task that the
Soviet government must set the people in all its scope is&#8212;learn to
work. The Taylor system, the last word of capitalism in this respect,
like all capitalist progress, is a combination of the refined brutality
of bourgeois exploitation and a number of the greatest scientific
achievements in the field of analysing mechanical motions during work,
the elimination of superfluous and awkward motions, the elaboration of
correct methods of work, the introduction of the best system of
accounting and control, etc. The Soviet Republic must at all costs
adopt all that is valuable in the achievements of science and
technology in this field. The possibility of building socialism depends
exactly upon our success in combining the Soviet power and the Soviet
organisation of administration with the up-to-date achievements of
capitalism. We must organise in Russia the study and teaching of the
Taylor system and systematically try it out and adapt it to our own
ends. At the same time, in working to raise the productivity of labour,
we must take into account the specific features of the transition
period from capitalism to socialism, which, on the one hand, require
that the foundations be laid of the socialist organisation of
competition, and, on the other hand, require the use of compulsion, so
that the slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat shall not be
desecrated by the practice of a lily-livered proletarian government.</p>
<a id="sec6" name="sec6" target="_blank" ></a>
<h3>The Organisation Of Competition</h3>

<p>Among the absurdities which the bourgeoisie are fond of spreading
about socialism is the allegation that socialists deny the importance
of competition. In fact, it is only socialism which, by abolishing
classes, and, consequently, by abolishing the enslavement of the
people, for the first time opens the way for competition on a really
mass scale. And it is precisely the Soviet form of organisation, by
ensuring transition from the formal democracy of the bourgeois republic
to real participation of the mass of working people in <em>administration</em>,
that for the first time puts competition on a broad basis. It is much
easier to organise this in the political field than in the economic
field; but for the success of socialism, it is the economic field that
matters.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a means of organising competition such as
publicity. The bourgeois republic ensures publicity only formally; in
practice, it subordinates the press to capital, entertains the &#8220;mob&#8221;
with sensationalist political trash and conceals what takes place in
the workshops, in commercial transactions, contracts, etc., behind a
veil of &#8220;trade secrets&#8221;, which protect &#8220;the sacred right of property&#8221;.
The Soviet government has abolished trade secrets<sup class="enote"><a
id="bk9" href="#fw9" name="bk9" target="_blank" >[9]</a></sup>; it has taken a new
path; but we have done hardly anything to utilise publicity for the
purpose of encouraging economic competition. While ruthlessly
suppressing the thoroughly mendacious and insolently slanderous
bourgeois press, we must set to work systematically to create a press
that will not entertain and fool the people with political sensation
and trivialities, but which will submitthe questions of everyday
economic life to the people&#8217;s judgement and assist in the serious study
of these questions. Every factory, every village is a producers&#8217; and
consumers&#8217; commune, whose right and duty it is to apply the general
Soviet laws in their own way ("in their own way&#8221;, not in the sense of
violating them, but in the sense that they can apply them in various
forms) and in their own way to solve the problem of accounting in the
production and distribution of goods. Under capitalism, this was the

&acirc;&#8220;private affair&acirc;&#8221; of the individual capitalist, landowner
or kulak. Under the Soviet system, it is not a private affair, but a
most important affair of state.</p>
<p>We have scarcely yet started on the enormous, difficult but
rewarding task of organising competition between communes, of
introducing accounting and publicity in the process of the production
of grain, clothes and other things, of transforming dry, dead,
bureaucratic accounts into living examples, some repulsive, others
attractive. Under the capitalist mode of production, the significance
of individual example, say the example of a co-operative workshop, was
inevitably very much restricted, and only those imbued with
petty-bourgeois illusions could dream of "correcting&#8221; capitalisim
through the example of virtuous institutions. After political power has
passed to the proletariat, after the expropriators have been
expropriated, the situation radically changes andeas prominent
socialists have repeatedly pointed out&#8212;force of example for the first
time is able to influence the people. Model communes must and will
serve as educators, teachers, helping to raise the backward communes.
The press must serve as an instrument of socialist construction, give
publicity to the successes achieved by the model communes in all their
details, must study the causes of these successes, the methods of
management these communes employ, and, on the other hand, must put on
the &#8220;black list&#8221; those communes which persist in the &#8220;traditions of
capitalism&#8221;, i.e., anarchy, laziness, disorder and profiteering. In
capitalist society, statistics were entirely a matter for &#8220;government
servants&#8221;, or for narrow specialists; we must carry statistics to the
people and make them popular so that the working people themselves may
gradually learn to understand and see how long and in what way it is
necessary to work, how much time and in what way one may rest, so that <em>the
comparison of the business results</em> of the various communes may
become a matter of general interest and study, and that the most
outstanding communes may be rewarded immediately (by reducing the
working day, raising remuneration, placing a larger amount of cultural
or aesthetic facilities or values at their disposal, etc.).</p>

<p>When a new class comes on to the historical scene as the leader and
guide of society, a period of violent &#8220;rocking&#8221;, shocks, struggle and
storm, on the one hand, and a period of uncertain steps, experiments,
wavering, hesitation in regard to the selection of new methods
corresponding to new objective circumstances, On the other, are
inevitable. The moribund feudal nobility avenged themselves on the
bourgeoisie which vanquished them and took their place, not only by
conspiracies and attempts at rebellion and restoration, but also by
pouring ridicule over the lack of skill, the clumsiness and the
mistakes of the &#8220;upstarts&#8221; and the &#8220;insolent&#8221; who dared to take over
the &#8220;sacred helm&#8221; of state without the centuries of training which the
princes, barons, nobles and dignitaries had had; in exactly the same
way the Kornilovs and Kerenskys, the Gotzes and Martovs, the whole of
that fraternity of heroes of bourgeois swindling or bourgeois
scepticism, avenge themselves on the working class of Russia for having
had the &#8220;audacity&#8221; to take power.</p>
<p>Of course, not weeks, but long months and years are required for a
new social class, especially a class which up to now has been oppressed
and crushed by poverty and ignorance, to get used to its new position,
look around, organise its work and promote its <em>own</em>

organisers. It is understandable that the Party which leads the
revolutionary proletariat has not been able to acquire the experience
and habits of large organisational undertakings embracing millions and
tens of millions of citizens; the remoulding of the old, almost
exclusively agitators&#8217; habits is a very lengthy process. But there is
nothing impossible in this, and as soon as the necessity for a change
is clearly appreciated, as soon as there is firm determination to
effect the change and perseverance in pursuing a great and difficult
aim, we shall achieve it. There is an enormous amount of organising
talent among the &#8220;people&#8221;, i.e., among the workers and the peasants who
do not exploit the labour of others. Capital crushed these talented
people in thousands; it killed their talent and threw them on to the
scrap-heap. We are not yet able to find them, encourage them, put them
on their feet, promote them. But we shall learn to do so if we set
about it with all-out revolutionary enthusiasm, without which there can
be no victorious revolutions.</p>
<p>No profound and mighty popular movement has ever occurred in history
without dirty scum rising to the top, without adventurers and rogues,
boasters and ranters attaching themselves to the inexperienced
innovators, without absurd muddle and fuss, without individual
&#8220;leaders&#8221; trying to deal with twenty matters at once and not finishing
any of them. Let the lap-dogs of bourgeois society, from Belorussov to
Martov, squeal and yelp about every extra chip that is sent flying in
cutting down the big, old wood. What else are lap-dogs for if not to
yelp at the proletarian elephant? Let them yelp. We shall go our way
and try as carefully and as patiently as possible to test and discover
real organisers, people with sober and practical minds, people who
combine loyally to socialism with ability without fuss (and in spite of
muddle and fuss) to get a large number of people working together
steadily and concertedly within the framework of Soviet organisation.
Only such people, after they have been tested a dozen times, by being
transferred from the simplest to the more difficult tasks, should be
promoted to the responsible posts of leaders of the people&#8217;s labour,
leaders of administration. We have not yet learned to do this, but we
shall learn.</p>

<h3>&#8220;Harmonious Organisation&#8221; And Dictatorship</h3>

<p>The resolution adopted by the recent Moscow Congress of Soviets
advanced as the primary task of the moment the establishment of a
&#8220;harmonious organisation&#8221;, and the tightening of discipline.<span
class="inote">[See also <a href="../../1918/mar/13.htm#toc4" target="_blank" >Resolution
On Ratification Of The Brest Treaty</a><em>&#8212;Editor</em>.]</span>
Everyone now readily &#8220;votes for&#8221; and &#8220;subscribes to&#8221; resolutions of
this kind; but usually people do not think over the fact that the
application of such resolutions calls for coercion&#8212;coercion precisely
in the form of dictatorship. And yet it would be extremely stupid and
ahsurdly utopian to assume that the transition from capitalism to
socialism is possible without coercion and without dictatorship. Marx&#8217;s
theory very definitely opposed this petty-bourgeois-democratic and
anarchist absurdity long ago. And Russia of 1917-18 confirms the
correctness of Marx&#8217;s theory in this respect so strikingly, palpably
and imposingly that only those who are hopelessly dull or who have
obstinately decided to turn thelr backs on the truth can be under any
misapprehension concerning this. Either the dictatorship of Kornilov
(if we take him as the Russian type of bourgeois Cavaignac), or the
dictatorship of the proletariat&#8212;any other choice is <em>out of the
question</em> for a country which is developing at an extremely rapid
rate with extremely sharp turns and amidst desperate ruin created by
one of the most horrible wars in history. Every solution that offers a
middle path is either a deception of the people by the bourgeoisie&#8212;for
the bourgeoisie dare not tell the truth, dare not say that they need
Kornilov&#8212;or an expression of the dull-wittedness of the petty-bourgeois
democrats, of the Chernovs, Tseretelis and Martovs, who chatter about
the unity of democracy, the dictatorship of democracy, the general
democratic front, and similar nonsense. Those whom even the progress of
the Russian Revolution of 1917-18 has not taught that a middle course
is impossible, must be given up for lost. </p>

<p>On the other hand, it is not difficult to see that during every
transition from capitalism to socialism, dictatorship is necessary for
two main reasons, or along two main channels. Firstly, capitalism
cannot be defeated and eradicated without the ruthless suppression of
the resistance of the exploiters, who cannot at once be deprived of
their wealth, of their advantages of organisation and knowledge, and
consequently for a fairly long period will inevitably try to overthrow
the hated rule of the poor; secondly, every great revolution, and a
socialist revolution in particular, even if there is no external war,
is inconceivable without internal war, i.e., civil war, which is even
more devastating than external war, and involves thousands and millions
of cases of wavering and desertion from one side to another, implies a
state of extreme indefiniteness, lack of equilibirium and chaos. And of
course, all the elements of disintegration of the old society, which
are inevitably very numerous and connected mainly with the petty
bourgeoisie (because it is the petty bourgeoisie that every war and
every crisis ruins and destroys first), are bound to &#8220;reveal
themselves&#8221; during such a profound revolution. And these elements of
disintegration <em>cannot</em> &#8220;reveal themselves&#8221; otherwise than in
an increase of crime, hooliganism, corruption, profiteering and
outrages of every kind. To put these down requires time and <em>requires
an iron hand</em>.</p>
<p>There has not been a single great revolution in history in which the
people did not instinctively realise this and did not show salutary
firmness by shooting thieves on the spot. The misfortune of previous
revolutions was that the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people, which
sustained them in their state of tension and gave them the strength to
suppress ruthlessly the elements of disintegration, did not last long.
The social, i.e., the class, reason for this instability of the
revolutionary enthusiasm of the people was the weakness of the
proletariat, which <em>alone</em> is able (if it is sufficiently
numerous, class-conscious and disciplined) to win over to its side <em>the
majority</em> of the working and exploited people (the majority of the
poor, to speak more simply and popularly) and retain power sufficiently
long to suppress completely all the exploiters as well as all the
elements of disintegration.</p>

<p>It was this historical experience of all revolutions, it was this
world-historic&#8212;economic and political&#8212;lesson that Marx summed up when
he gave his short, sharp, concise and expressive formula: dictatorship
of the proletariat. And the fact that the Russian revolution has been
correct in its approach to this world-historic task <em>has been proved</em>
by the victorious progress of the Soviet form of organisation among all
the peoples and tongues of Russia. For Soviet power is nothing but an
organisational form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the
dictatorship of the advanced class, which raises to a new democracy and
to independent participation in the administration of the state tens
upon tens of millions of working and exploited peoples who by their own
experience learn to regard the disciplined and class-conscious vanguard
of the proletariat as their most reliable leader.</p>
<p>Dictatorship, however, is a big word, and big words should not be
thrown about carelessly. Dictatorship is iron rule, government that is
revolutionarily bold, swift and ruthless in suppressing both exploiters
and hooligans. But our government is excessively mild, very often it
resembles jelly more than iron. We must not forget for a moment that
the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois element is fighting against the
Soviet system in two ways; on the one hand, it is operating from
without, by the methods of the Savinkovs, Gotzes, Gegechkoris and
Kornilovs, by conspiracies and rebellions, and by their filthy
&#8220;ideological&#8221; reflection, the flood of lies and slander in the
Constitutional-Democratic, Right Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik
press; on the other hand, this element operates from within and takes
advantage of every manifestation of disintegration, of every weakness,
in order to bribe, to increase indiscipline, laxity and chaos. The
nearer we approach the complete military suppression of the
bourgeoisie, the more dangerous does the element of petty-bourgeois
anarchy become. And the fight against this element cannot be waged
solely with the aid of propaganda and agitation, solely by organising
competition and by selecting organisers. The struggle must also be
waged by means of coercion.</p>
<p>As the fundamental task of the government becomes, not military
suppression, but administration, the typical manifestation of
suppression and compulsion will be, not shooting on the spot, but trial
by court. In this respect also the revolutionary people after October
25, 1917 took the right path and demonstrated the viability of the
revolution by setting up their own workers&#8217; and peasants&#8217; courts, even
before the decrees dissolving the bourgeois bureaucratic judiciary were
passed. But our revolutionary and people&#8217;s courts are extremely,
incredibly weak. One feels that we have not yet done away with the
people&#8217;s attitude towards the courts as towards something official and
alien, an attitude inherited from the yoke of the landowners and of the
bourgeoisie. It is not yet sufficiently realised that the courts are an
organ which enlists precisely the poor, every one of them, in the work
of state administration (for the work of the courts is one of the
functions of state administration), that the courts are an <em>organ
of the power</em> of the proletariat and of the poor peasants, that the
courts are an instrument <em>for inculcating discipline</em>. There is
not yet sufficient appreciation of the simple and obvious fact that if
the principal misfortunes of Russia at the present time are hunger and
unemployment, these misfortunes cannot be overcome by spurts, but only
by comprehensive, all-embracing, country-wide organisation and
discipline in order to increase the output of bread for the people and
bread for industry (fuel), to transport these in good time to the
places where they are required, and to distribute them properly; and it
is not fully appreciated that, consequently, it is <em>those</em> who
violate labour discipline at any factory, in any undertaking, in any
matter, who are <em>responsible</em> for the sufferings caused by the
famine and unemployment, that we must know how to find the guilty ones,
to bring them to trial and ruthlessly punish them. Where the
petty-bourgeois anarchy against which we must now wage a most
persistent struggle makes itself felt is in the failure to appreciate
the economic and political connection between famine and unemployment,
on the one hand, and general laxity in matters of organisation and
discipline, on the other&#8212;in the tenacity of the <em>small-proprietor</em>

outlook, namely, I&#8217;ll grab all I can for myself; the rest can go hang.</p>
<p>In the rail transport service, which perhaps most strikingly
embodies the economic ties of an organism created by large-scale
capitalism, the struggle between the element of petty-bourgeois laxity
and proletarian organisation is particularly evident. The
&#8220;administrative&#8221; elements provide a host of saboteurs and bribe-takers;
the best part of the proletarian elements fight for discipline; but
among both elements there are, of course, many waverers and &#8220;weak&#8221;
characters who are unable to withstand the &#8220;temptation&#8221; of
profiteering, bribery, personal gain obtained by spoiling the whole
apparatus, upon the proper working of which the victory over famine and
unemployment depends.</p>
<p>The struggle that has been developing around the recent decree on
the management of the railways, the decree which grants individual
executives dictatorial powers (or &#8220;unlimited&#8221; powers),<a id="bk10"
href="#fw10" name="bk10" target="_blank" ><sup class="enote">[10]</sup></a> is
characteristic. The conscious (and to a large extent, probably,
unconscious) representatives of petty bourgeois laxity would like to
see in this granting of &#8220;unlimited&#8221; (i.e., dictatorial) powers to
individuals a departure from the collegiate principle, from democracy
and from the principles of Soviet government. Here and there, among
Left Socialist-RevoIutionaries, a positively hooligan agitation, i.e.,
agitation appealing to the base instincts and to the small proprietor&#8217;s
urge to &#8220;grab all he can&#8221;, has been developed against the dictatorship
decree. The question has become one of really enormous significance.
Firstly, the question of principle, namely, is the appointment of
individuals, dictators with unlimited powers, in general compatible
with the fundamental principles of Soviet government? Secondly, what
relation has this case&#8212;this precedent, if you will&#8212;to the special tasks
of government in the present concrete situation? We must deal very
thoroughly with both these questions.</p>

<p>That in the history of revolutionary movements the dictatorship of
individuals was very often the expression, the vehicle, the channel of
the dictatorship of the revolutionary classes has been shown by the
irrefutable experience of history. Undoubtedly, the dictatorship of
individuals was compatible with bourgeois democracy. On this point, how
ever, the bourgeois denigrators of the Soviet system, as well as their
petty-bourgeois henchmen, always display sleight of hand: on the one
hand, they declare the Soviet system to be something absurd,
anarchistic and savage, and carefully pass over in silence all our
historical examples and theoretical arguments which prove that the
Soviets are a higher form of democracy, and what is more, the beginning
of a <em>socialist</em> form of democracy; on the other hand, they
demand of us a higher democracy than bourgeois democracy and say:
personal dictatorship is absolutely incompatible with your, Bolshevik
(i.e., not bourgeois, but <em>socialist</em> ), Soviet democracy.</p>
<p>These are exceedingly poor arguments. If we are not anarchists, we
must admit that the state, <em>that is</em>, <em>coercion</em>, is
necessary for the transition from capitalism to socialism. The form of
coercion is determined by the degree of development of the given
revolutionary class, and also by special circumstances, such as, for
example, the legacy of a long and reactionary war and the forms of
resistance put up by the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. There
is, therefore, absolutely <em>no</em> contradiction in principle
between Soviet (<em>that is</em>, socialist) democracy and the exercise
of dictatorial powers by individuals. The difference between
proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship is that the former
strikes at the exploiting minority in the interests of the exploited
majority, and that it is exercised&#8212;<em>also through individuals</em>&#8212;not
only by the working and exploited people, but also by organisations
which are built in such a way as to rouse these people to
history-making activity. (The Soviet organisations are organisations of
this kind.)</p>

<p>In regard to the second question, concerning the significance of
individual dictatorial powers from the point of view of the specific
tasks of the present moment, it must be said that large-scale machine
industry&#8212;which is precisely the material source, the productive source,
the foundation of socialism&#8212;calls for absolute and strict unity of
will, which directs the joint labours of hundreds, thousands and tens
of thousands of people. The technical, economic and historical
necessity of this is obvious, and all those who have thought about
socialism have always regarded it as one of the conditions of
socialism. But how can strict unity of will be ensured? By thousands
subordinating their will to the will of one.</p>
<p>Given ideal class-consciousness and discipline on the part of those
participating in the common work, this subordination would be something
like the mild leadership of a conductor of an orchestra. It may assume
the sharp forms of a dictatorship if ideal discipline and
class-consciousness are lacking. But be that as it may, <em>unquestioning
subordination</em> to a single will is absolutely necessary for the
success of processes organised on the pattern of large-scale machine
industry. On the railways it is twice and three times as necessary. In
this transition from one political task to another, which on the
surface is totally dissimilar to the first, lies the whole originality
of the present situation. The revolution has only just smashed the
oldest, strongest and heaviest of fetters, to which the people
submitted under duress. That was yesterday. Today, however, the same
revolution demands&#8212;precisely in the interests of its development and
consolidation, precisely in the interests of socialism&#8212;that the people <em>unquestioningly
obey the single will</em> of the leaders of labour. Of course, such a
transition cannot be made at one step. Clearly, it can be achieved only
as a result of tremendous jolts, shocks, reversions to old ways, the
enormous exertion of effort on the part of the proletarian vanguard,
which is leading the people to the new ways. Those who drop into the
philistine hysterics of <em>Novaya Zhizn</em> or <em>Vperyod</em>,<a
id="bk11" href="#fw11" name="bk11" target="_blank" ><sup class="enote">[11]</sup></a> <em>Dyelo
Naroda</em> or <a id="bk12" href="#fw12" name="bk12" target="_blank" ><sup class="enote">[12]</sup></a>

do not stop to think about this.</p>
<p>Take the psychology of the average, ordinary representative of the
toiling and exploited masses, compare it with the objective, material
conditions of his life in society. Before the October Revolution he did
<em>not</em> see a single instance of the propertied, exploiting
classes making any real sacrifice for him, giving up anything for his
benefit. He did <em>not</em> see them giving him the land and liberty
that had been repeatedly promised him, giving him peace, sacrificing
&#8220;Great Power&#8221; interests and the interests of Great Power secret
treaties, sacrificing capital and profits. He saw this only <em>after</em>
October 25, 1917, when he took it himself by force, and had to defend
by force what he had taken, against the Kerenskys, Gotzes, Gegechkoris,
Dutovs and Kornilovs. Naturally, for a certain time, all his attention,
all his thoughts, all his spiritual strength, were concentrated on
taking a breath, on unbending his back, on straightening his shoulders,
on taking the blessings of life that were there for the taking, and
that had always been denied him by the now overthrown exploiters. Of
course, a certain amount of time is required to enable the ordinary
working man not only to see for himself, not only to become convinced,
but also to feel that he cannot simply &#8220;take&#8221;, snatch, grab things,
that this leads to increased disruption, to ruin, to the return of the
Kornilovs. The corresponding change in the conditions of life (and
consequently in the psychology) of the ordinary working men is only
just beginning. And our whole task, the task of the Communist Party
(Bolsheviks), which is the class-conscious spokesman for the strivings
of the exploited for emancipation, is to appreciate this change, to
understand that it is necessary, to stand at the head of the exhausted
people who are wearily seeking a way out and lead them along the true
path, along the path of labour discipline, along the path of
co-ordinating the task of arguing at mass meetings <em>about</em> the
conditions of work with the task of unquestioningly obeying the will of
the Soviet leader, of the dictator, <em>during</em> the work.</p>

<p>The &#8220;mania for meetings&#8221; is an object of the ridicule, and still
more often of the spiteful hissing of the bourgeoisie, the Mensheviks,
the <em>Novaya Zhizn</em> people, who see only the chaos, the
confusion and the outbursts of small-proprietor egoism. But without the
discussions at public meetings the mass of the oppressed could never
have changed from the discipline forced upon them by the exploiters to
conscious, voluntary discipline. The airing of questions at public
meetings is the genuine democracy of the working people, their way of
unbending their backs, their awakening to a new life, their first steps
along the road which they themselves have cleared of vipers (the
exploiters, the imperialists, the landowners and capitalists) and which
they want to learn to build themselves, in their own way, for
themselves, on the principles of their own <em>Soviet</em>, and not
alien, not aristocratic, not bourgeois rule. It required precisely the
October victory of the working people over the exploiters, it required
a whole historical period in wllich the workillg people themselves
could first of all discuss the new conditions of life and the new
tasks, in order to make possible the durable transition to superior
forms of labour discipline, to the conscious appreciation of the
necessity for the dictatorship of the proletariat, to unquestioning
obedience to the orders of individual representatives of the Soviet
government during the work.</p>
<p>This transition has now begun.</p>
<p>We have successfully fulfilled the first task of the revolution; we
have seen how the mass of working people evolved in themselves the
fundamental condition for its success: they united their efforts
against the exploiters in order to overthrow them. Stages like that of
October 1905, February and October 1917 are of world-historic
significance.</p>
<p>We have successfully fulfilled the second task of the revolution: to
awaken, to raise those very &#8220;lower ranks&#8221; of society whom the
exploiters had pushed down, and who only after October 25, 1917
obtained complete freedom to overthrow the exploiters and to begin to
take stock of things and arrange life in their own way. The airing of
questions at public meetings by the most oppressed and downtrodden, by
the least educated mass of working people, their coming over to the
side of the Bolsheviks, their setting up every where of their own
Soviet organisations&#8212;this was the second great stage of the revolution.</p>

<p>The third stage is now beginning. We must consolidate what we
ourselves have won, what we ourselves have decreed, made law,
discussed, planned&#8212;consolidate all this in stable forms of <em>everyday
labour discipline</em>. This is the most difficult, but the most
gratifying task, because only its fulfilment will give us a socialist
system. We must learn to combine the &#8220;public meeting&#8221; democracy of the
working people&#8212;turbulent, surging, overflowing its banks like a spring
flood&#8212;with <em>iron</em> discipline while at work, with <em>unquestioning
obedience</em> to the will of a single person, the Soviet leader, while
at work.</p>
<p>We have not yet learned to do this.</p>

<p>We shall learn it.</p>
<p>Yesterday we were mennced by the restoration of bourgeois
exploitation, personified by the Kornilovs, Gotzes, Dutovs, Gegechkoris
and Bogayevskys. We conquered them. This restoration, this very same
restoration menaces us today in another form, in the form of the
element of petty-bourgeois laxity and anarchism, or small-proprietor
&#8220;it&#8217;s not my business&#8221; psychology, in the form of the daily, petty, but
numerous sorties and attacks of this element against proletarian
discipline. We must, and we shall, vanquish this element of
petty-bourgeois anarchy.</p>
<a id="sec8" name="sec8" target="_blank" ></a>
<h3>The Development Of Soviet Organisation</h3>
<p>The socialist character of Soviet, i.e., <em>proletarian</em>,
democracy, as concretely applied today, lies first in the fact that the
electors are the working and exploited people; the bourgeoisie is
excluded. Secondly, it lies in the fact that all bureaucratic
formalities and restrictions of elections are abolished; the people
themselves determine the order and time of elections, and are
completely free to recall any elected person. Thirdly, it lies in the
creation of the best mass organisation of the vanguard of the working
people, i.e., the proletariat engaged in large-scale industry, which
enables it to lead the vast mass of the exploited, to draw them into
independent political life, to educate them politically by their own
experience; therefore for the first time a start is made by the <em>entire</em>
population in learning the art of administration, and in beginning to
administer.</p>

<p>These are the principal distinguishing features of the democracy now
applied in Russia, which is a higher <em>type</em> of democracy, a
break with the bourgeois distortion of democracy, transition to
socialist democracy and to the conditions in which the state can begin
to wither away.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the element of petty-bourgeois
disorganisation (which must <em>inevitably</em> be apparent to some
extent in <em>every</em> proletarian revolution, and which is
especially apparent in our revolution, owing to the petty-bourgeois
character of our country, its backwardness and the consequences of a
reactionary war) cannot but leave its impress upon the Soviets as well.</p>
<p>We must work unremittingly to develop the organisation of the
Soviets and of the Soviet government. There is a petty-bourgeois
tendency to transform the members of the Soviets into
&#8220;parliamentarians&#8221;, or else into bureaucrats. We must combat this by
drawing <em>all</em> the members of the Soviets into the practical
work of administration. In many places the departments of the Soviets
are gradually merging with the Commissariats. Our aim is to draw <em>the
whole of the poor</em> into the practical work of administration, and
all steps that are taken in this direction&#8212;the more varied they are,
the better&#8212;should be carefully recorded, studied, systematised, tested
by wider experience and embodied in law. Our aim is to ensure that <em>every</em>

toiler, having finished his eight hours&#8217; &#8220;task&#8221; in productive labour,
shall perform state duties <em>without pay</em>; the transition to
this is particularly difficult, but this transition alone can guarantee
the final consolidation of socialism. Naturally, the novelty and
difficulty of the change lead to an abundance of steps being taken, as
it were, gropingly, to an abundance of mistakes, vacillation&#8212;without
this, any marked progress is impossible. The reason why the present
position seems peculiar to many of those who would like to be regarded
as socialists is that they have been accustomed to contrasting
capitalism with socialism abstractly, and that they profoundly put
between the two the word &#8220;leap&#8221; (some of them; recalling fragments of
what they have read of Engels&#8217;s writings, still more profoundly add the
phrase &#8220;leap from the realm of necessity into the realm of freedom&#8221;<a
id="bk13" href="#fw13" name="bk13" target="_blank" ><sup class="enote">[13]</sup></a>.
The majority of these so-called socialists, who have &#8220;read in books&#8221;

about socialism but who have never seriously thought over the matter,
are unable to consider that by &#8220;leap&#8221; the teachers of socialism meant
turning-points on a world historical scale, and that leaps of this kind
extend over decades and even longer periods. Naturally, in such times,
the notorious &#8220;intelligentsia&#8221; provides an infinite number of mourners
of the dead. Some mourn over the Constituent Assembly, others mourn
over bourgeois discipline, others again mourn over the capitalist
system, still others mourn over the cultured landowner, and still
others again mourn over imperialist Great Power policy, etc., etc.</p>
<p>The real interest of the epoch of great leaps lies in the fact that
the abundance of fragments of the old, which sometimes accumulate more
rapidly than the rudiments (not always immediately discernible) of the
new, calls for the ability to discern what is most important in the
line or chain of development. History knows moments when the most
important thing for the success of the revolution is to heap up as
large a quantity of the fragments as possible, i.e., to blow up as many
of the old institutions as possible; moments arise when enough has been
blown up and the next task is to perform the &#8220;prosaic&#8221; (for the
petty-bourgeois revolutionary, the &#8220;boring&#8221;) task of clearing away the
fragments; and moments arise when the careful nursing of the rudiments
of the new system, which are growing amidst the wreckage on a soil
which as yet has been badly cleared of rubble, is the most important
thing.</p>
<p>It is not enough to be a revolutionary and an adherent of socialism
or a Communist in general. You must be able at each particular moment
to find the particular link in the chain which you must grasp with all
your might in order to hold the whole chain and to prepare firmly for
the transition to the next link; the order of the links, their form,
the manner in which they are linked together, the way they differ from
each other in the historical chain of events, are not as simple and not
as meaningless as those in an ordinary chain made by a smith.</p>

<p>The fight against the bureaucratic distortion of the Soviet form of
organisation is assured by the firmness of the connection between the
Soviets and the &#8220;people&#8221;, meaning by that the working and exploited
people, and by the flexibility and elasticity of this connection. Even
in the most democratic capitalist republics in the world, the poor
never regard the bourgeois parliament as &#8220;their&#8221; institution. But the
Soviets are &#8220;theirs&#8221; and not alien institutions to the mass of workers
and peasants. The modern &#8220;Social-Democrats&#8221; of the Scheidemann or, what
is almost the same thing, of the Martov type are repelled by the
Soviets, and they are drawn towards the respectable bourgeois
parliament, <a id="p274" name="p274" target="_blank" ></a>or to the Constituent
Assembly, in the same way as Turgenev, sixty years ago, was drawn
towards a moderate monarchist and noblemen&#8217;s Constitution and was
repelled by the peasant democracy of Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky.<a
id="bk14" href="#fw14" name="bk14" target="_blank" ><sup class="enote">[14]</sup></a></p>
<p>It is the closeness of the Soviets to the &#8220;people&#8221;, to the working
people, that creates the special forms of recall and other means of
control from below which must be most zealously developed now. For
example, the Councils of Public Education, as periodical conferences of
Soviet electors and their delegates called to discuss and control the
activities of the Soviet authorities in this field, deserve full
sympathy and support. Nothing could be sillier than to transform the
Soviets into something congealed and self-contained. The more
resolutely we now have to stand for a ruthlessly firm government, for
the dictatorship of individuals <em>in definite processes of work</em>,
in definite aspects of <em>purely executive</em> functions, the more
varied must be the forms and methods of control from below in order to
counteract every shadow of a possibility of distorting the principles
of Soviet government, in order repeatedly and tirelessly to weed out
bureaucracy.</p>

<a id="sec9" name="sec9" target="_blank" ></a>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>An extraordinarily difficult, complex and dangerous situation in
international affairs; the necessity of manoeuvring and retreating; a
period of waiting for new outbreaks of the revolution which is maturing
in the West at a painfully slow pace; within the country a period of
slow construction and ruthless &#8220;tightening up&#8221;, of prolonged and
persistent struggle waged by stern, proletarian discipline against the
menacing element of petty-bourgeois laxity and anarchy&#8212;these in brief
are the distinguishing features of the special stage of the socialist
revolution in which we are now living. This is the link in the
historical chain of events which we must at present grasp with all our
might in order to prove equal to the tasks that confront us before
passing to the next link to which we are drawn by a special brightness,
the brightness of the victories of the international proletarian
revolution.</p>
<p>Try to compare with the ordinary everyday concept &#8220;revolutionary&#8221;
the slogans that follow from the specific conditions of the present
stage, namely, manoeuvre, retreat, wait, build slowly, ruthlessly
tighten up, rigorously discipline, smash laxity. . . . Is it surprising
that when certain &#8220;revolutionaries&#8221; hear this they are seized with
noble indignation and begin to &#8220;thunder&#8221; abuse at us for forgetting the
traditions of the October Revolution, for compromising with the
bourgeois experts, for compromising with the bourgeoisie, for being
petty bourgeois, reformists, and so on and so forth?</p>

<p>The misfortune of these sorry &#8220;revolutionaries&#8221; is that even those
of them who are prompted by the best motives in the world and are
absolutely loyal to the cause of socialism fail to understand the
particular, and particularly &#8220;unpleasant&#8221;, condition that a backward
country, which has been lacerated by a reactionary and disastrous war
and which began the socialist revolution long before the more advanced
countries, inevitably has to pass through; they lack stamina in the
difficult moments of a difficult transition. Naturally, it is the &#8220;Left
Socialist-Revolutionaries&#8221; who are acting as an &#8220;official&#8221; opposition
of <em>this</em> kind against our Party. Of course, there are and
always will be individual exceptions from group and class types. But
social types remain. In the land in which the small-proprietor
population greatly predominates over the purely proletarian population,
the difference between the proletarian revolutionary and
petty-bourgeois revolutionary will inevitably make itself felt, and
from time to time will make itself felt very sharply. The
petty-bourgeois revolutionary wavers and vacillates at every turn of
events; he is an ardent revolutionary in March 1917 and praises

&#8220;coalition&#8221; in May, hates the Bolsheviks (or laments over their
&#8220;adventurism&#8221;) in July and apprehensively turns away from them at the
end of October, supports them in December, and, finally, in March and
April 1918 such types, more often than not, turn up their noses
contemptuously and say: &#8220;I am not one of those who sing hymns to
&#8217;organic&#8217; work, to practicalness and gradualism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The social origin of such types is the small proprietor, who has
been driven to frenzy by the horrors of war, by sudden ruin, by
unprecedented torments of famine and devastation, who hysterically
rushes about seeking a way out, seeking salvation, places his
confidence in the proletariat and supports it one moment and the next
gives way to fits of despair. We must clearly understand and firmly
remember the fact that socialism cannot be built on such a social
basis. The only class that can lead the working and exploited people is
the class that unswervingly follows its path without losing courage and
without giving way to despair even at the most difficult, arduous and
dangerous stages. Hysterical impulses are of no use to us. What we need
is the steady advance of the iron battalions of the proletariat.</p>

abridged version in German, edited by F. Platten, appeared in Zurich
under the title <em>Am Tage nach der Revolution</em>.</p>
<p class="endnote">The Central Committee instructed Lenin to give a

average monthly wage. On January 2 (15),1918, in answer to an inquiry
from the People&#8217;s Commissar for Labour A. G Shlyapnikov, the Council of

over foreign trade was initiated in the early days of Soviet power. At
first this was handled by the Petrograd Revolutionary Military
Committee, which considered applications for the import and export of
goods and supervised the work of the customs. By a decree of the
Council of People&#8217;s Commissars of December 29 1917 (January 11, 1918)
foreign trade was placed under the control of the People&#8217;s Commissariat
for Trade and Industry. This kind of control and customs inspection,
however, was not enough to protect the Soviet economy from foreign
capital. Lenin emphasised later that the working class of Soviet Russia
&#8220;would be totally unable to build up its own industry and make Russia
an industrial country without the protection, not of tariffs, but of
the monopoly of foreign trade&#8221; (see V. I. Lenin, <em>On the Foreign
Policy of the Soviet State</em>, Moscow, p. 424). In December 1917
Lenin proposed introducing a state monopoly on foreign trade, a decree
on which was passed by the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars on April 22,
1918 (see <em>Decrees of the Soviet Government</em>, Russ. ed., Vol.
2, 1959, pp. 158-60).</p>
<p class="endnote"><a id="fw5" href="#bk5" name="fw5" target="_blank" >[5]</a> In the
first months of Soviet power indemnities and special taxes were one of
the principal sources of revenue, particularly in the provinces. When
Soviet power became more firmly establisiled the question arose of how
to devise a regular system of taxation based primarily on a progressive
income tax and a property tax which would make it possible to place the
main burden of taxation on the well-to-do sections of the population.
At the First All-Russia Congress of Representatives of the Financial
Departments of the Soviets, Lenin pointed out: &#8220;We have many plans in
this sphere and have cleared the ground on which to build the
foundation, but the actual foundation of that building has not yet been
built. The time for this has now come&#8221; (see this volume, pp. 384-85).
The Congress accepted Lenin&#8217;s proposal on the need to introduce an
income tax and property tax and elected a special commission to draw up
the requisite Statute on the basis of Lenin&#8217;s theses.</p>

<p class="endnote">On June 17,1918 the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars
approved the Decree on the Amendment of the Decree of November 24, 1917
on the Levying of Direct Taxes, which laid down a strict system of
income and property taxation (see <em>Decrees of the Soviet Government</em>,
Russ. ed., Vol. 2, 1959, pp. 441-43).</p>
<p class="endnote"><a id="fw6" href="#bk6" name="fw6" target="_blank" >[6]</a> <em>Decree
on Consumers&#8217; Co-operative Societies</em> was passed by the Council of
People&#8217;s Commissars on April 10, 1918, approved at a meeting of the
All-Russia C.E.C. on April 11, and published over Lenin&#8217;s signature in <em>Pravda</em>
No. 71 of April 13 and <em>Izvestia VTsIK</em> No. 75 of April 16.</p>

<p class="endnote">The first draft of the decree, written by Lenin, was
worked out in detail by the People&#8217;s Commissariat for Food and
published on January 19 (February 1) in <em>Izvestia TsIK</em> No. 14.
The draft decree was bitterly opposed by bourgeois co-operators, who
insisted that co-operative societies should be independent of the
organs of Soviet power. In order to use the existillg co-operative
apparatus for accounting and control of the distribntion of foodstuffs
the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars made several concessions during its
negotiations with bourgeois co-operators (March to the beginning of
April 1918). On April 9 and 10 the C.P.C. discussed the draft decree
proposed by the co-operators. Lenin revised the draft considerably (he
rewrote points 11, 12 and 13), and the decree with his amendments was
passed by the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars, and then by the
All-Russia C.E.C.</p>
<p class="endnote"><a id="fw7" href="#bk7" name="fw7" target="_blank" >[7]</a> The
organisation of social production on socialist principles made it
necessary to draw up new internal regulations for the nationalised
enterprises, and new regulations on labour discipline and on enrolling
all able-bodied persons for socially useful work. These questions
acquired special importance in the period of the peaceful
breathing-space in the spring of 1918.</p>
<p class="endnote">The first regulations concerning labour discipline
were worked out by the Soviet trade unions in conjunction with
managerial bodies. They were discussed at a number of meetings of the
Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council with representatives of the
central organs of the trade unions taking part. On March 27 the
Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council after a debate in which Lenin
participated passed a decision charging the All-Russia Central Council
of Trade Unions with the task of drawing up a general statute on labour
discipline. On April 1, with Lenin taking part, the Presidium examined
the draft resolution on labour discipline drawn up by the A.C.C.T.U.
and proposed that it should be re-worded as a decree, taking into
account Lenin&#8217;s remarks and suggestions. The re-worded Statute on
Labour Discipline passed by the A.C.C.T.U. on April 3 was published in
the magazine <em>Narodnoye Khozyaistvo</em> No. 2, for April 1918. In
this statute the A.C.C.T.U. stated that strict regulations regarding
internal management should be introduced at all state-owned
enterprises, that output quotas and account of labour productivity
should be established, that piece-work and a system of bonuses for
exceeding output quotas should be introduced, and that stern action
should be taken against those who violated labour discipline. On the
basis of the Statute speciflc internal regulations were drawn up at
factories and these played an important part in the organisation of
socialist industry. The Central Committee of the Metalworkers&#8217; Union
was one of the first to carry out Lenin&#8217;s instructions on raising
labour productivity by introducing a system of piece-work and bonuses.
When the question of improving labour discipline was discussed by the
A.C.C.T.U. representatives of the Central Committee of the
Metalworkers&#8217; Union got the thesis on the need for piece rates included
in the resolution submitted on April 1 for consideration by the
Presidium of the Supremc Economic Council. In April, on the basis of
the decisions taken by the A.C.C.T.U. the Central Committee of the
Metalworkers&#8217; Union instructed all the lower organisations of the union
to adopt piece-work and the bonus system in the metal industry.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a id="fw8" href="#bk8" name="fw8" target="_blank" >[8]</a> After the
October Revolution piece-work was almost everywhere superseded by a
time system of payment, which had an adverse effect on labour
productivity and labour discipline.</p>
<p class="endnote">The introduction of piece-work, which came closest
to the socialist principle of &#8220;to each according to his work&#8221;, began at
the first nationalised enterprises. During the period of respite, piece
work was widely adopted in industry. By July 1918, for instance, a
quarter of the workers of Petrograd went over to piece-work. The
principle of payment according to the piece was finally endorsed by the
pubucation in December 1918 of the Soviet Labour Code.</p>
<p class="endnote"><a id="fw9" href="#bk9" name="fw9" target="_blank" >[9]</a> This
refers to the right protected by bourgeois law to keep secret all
production, trade and financial operations and also all the relevant
documents at private capitalist enterprises.</p>
<p class="endnote">In his work <em>The Impending Catastrophe and How
to Combat It</em> Lenin showed that commercial secrecy in the hands of
the bourgeoisie was &#8220;an instrument for concealing financial swindles
and the fantastically high profits of big capital&#8221; (see present
edition, Vol. 25, p. 339), and showed why commercial secrecy should be
abolished. The resolution of the Sixth Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)

&#8220;On the Economic Situation&#8221; demanded the abolition of commercial
secrecy as an essential measure for making workers&#8217; control effective
(see <em>The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of Congresses</em>,
<em>Conferences and Plenums of the Central Committee</em>, Part 1,
Russ. ed., 1954, p. 378). After the October Revolution commercial
secrecy was abolished by the Statute on Workers&#8217; Control passed by the
All-Russia C.E.C. and the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars on November 14
(27), 1917.</p>
<p class="endnote"><a id="fw10" href="#bk10" name="fw10" target="_blank" >[10]</a> The
reference is to the decree of the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars &#8220;On
Centralisation of Management, Protection of Roads and the Improvement
of Their Carrying Capacity&#8221; (see <em>Decrees of the Soviet Government</em>,
Vol. 2 Russ. ed., 1959, pp. 18-20). Having considered on March 18, 1918
the draft decree proposed by the People&#8217;s Commissariat for Ways of
Communication on non-interference by various institutions in the
affairs of the Railway Department, the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars
instructed a special commission to revise the decree on the basis of
the following theses put forward by Lenin: (1) Considerable
centralisation. (2) Appointment of responsible executives at every
local centre as elected by the railway organisations. (3) Unquestioning
obedience to their orders. (4) Dictatorial rights to be given to the
military detachments for maintaining order. (5) Steps to be taken
immediately to take account of rolling stock and its whereabouts. (6)
Steps to be taken to set up a technical department. (7) Fuel.</p>

<p class="endnote">Lenin made several important amendments to the
draft, which was submitted by the commission and considered at a
meeting of the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars on March 21, before being
approved by the government. In view of the hostilily with which the
decree was greeted by the All-Russia Executive Committee of Railwaymen
(Vikzhedor), which was strongly influenced by the Mensheviks and the
Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, the People&#8217;s Commissariat for Ways of
Communication on March 23 proposed amending the decree at a meeting of
the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars. The representatives of Vikzhedor
who attended the meeting attacked the decree on the grounds that it
meant the &#8220;destruction of the role of Vikzhedor and its replacement by
the individual authority of a Commissar&#8221;. Arguing against the opponents
of the decree, Lenin explained the need for taking the very firmest
measures to eliminate sabotage and inefficiency on the railways and
introduced amendments making the decree even more categorical. With
these amendments the decree was finally approved by the government on
March 23 and published over Lenin&#8217;s signature on March 26 in No. 57 of <em>Izvestia
VTsIK</em>.</p>
