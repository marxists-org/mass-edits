    <p class="fst">January 12, 1918.</p>

    <p class="fst">In view of the looming danger of famine in Petrograd, and in
    accordance with the Council of People's Commissars decision on the
    inspection of railways in Petrograd and its vicinity to discover any
    possible carloads of grain in the yards, the Red Guard H.Q. is hereby
    ordered to help carry out such inspection and apprehend profiteers and
    saboteurs.</p>

    <p>With this aim in view, the required number of detachments must be
    immediately formed and dispatched tomorrow morning, January 13, to Comrade
    Nevsky or his Deputy at the Commissariat for Railway Affairs, to conduct
    the following joint operations with him:</p>

    <p>(1) make a round of the stations and get their chiefs and other
    administrative personnel to sign written statements that there is not a
    single carload of grain or foodstuffs (at the station or on the railway
    tracks);</p>

    <p>(2) to verify that there are actually no carloads of grain, etc.; the
    check-up to be conducted jointly with railwaymen;</p>

    <p>(3) in the event of false evidence or misleading reports, administrative
    personnel (by agreement with railwaymen's committees) should be arrested
    and handed over to revolutionary tribunals.</p>

    <p class="sig">V. Ulyanov (Lenin),<br />
     Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars</p>
