    <h2>Report On The Work Of The Council Of People&#8217;s Commissars
      December 22</h2>

    <hr />
 
    <p class="fst">(<em>Shouts from the hall </em>: &#8220;Long live
    Comrade Lenin!&#8221; <em>Storm of applause. An ovation.</em>)
    Comrades, I have to present a report on the home and foreign
    policy of the government. I do not think it is the purpose of my
    report to give you a list of at least the most outstanding or most
    important laws and measures adopted by the workers&#8217; and
    peasants&#8217; government. Nor do I think that you would be
    interested in an account of the events of this period, or that it
    is very important that I should give one. As I see it, general
    conclusions should be drawn from the principal lessons we have
    learnt during this year, which was no less abundant in abrupt
    political changes than the preceding years of the revolution
    were. From the general lessons of this year&#8217;s experience we
    must deduce the most urgent political and economic tasks that face
    us, tasks to which the Soviet government&#8212;both through the
    legislative acts which are being submitted for your examination
    and endorsement and through the sum total of its measures&#8212;at
    present attaches the greatest hopes and significance, and from the
    fulfilment of which it expects important progress in our economic
    development. Permit me, therefore, to confine myself to brief
    comments on the Republic&#8217;s international situation and on
    the chief results of our foreign policy during the past year.</p>

    <p>You all know, of course, how the Polish landowners and
    capitalists forced a war on us under the pressure and at the
    insistence of the capitalist countries of Western Europe, and not
    of Western Europe alone. You know that in April of this year we
    made peace proposals to the Polish Government, on terms which were
    incomparably more advantageous to it than the present terms, and
    that it was only under pressure of dire necessity, after our
    negotiations for an armistice with Poland had ended in a complete
    breakdown, that we were obliged to fight. Despite the heavy defeat
    our forces suffered near Warsaw, as a result of their undoubted
    exhaustion, this war has ended in a peace that is far more
    favourable to us than the one we proposed to Poland in April. A
    preliminary treaty with Poland has been signed, and negotiations
    are now under way for the conclusion of a final peace treaty. We
    certainly do not conceal from ourselves the danger presented by
    the pressure being exerted by some of the more stubborn capitalist
    countries and by certain Russian whiteguard circles with the aim
    of preventing these negotiations from ending in a peace. It
    should, however, be said that the Entente&#8217;s policy, which
    aims at military intervention and the armed suppression of the
    Soviets, is steadily coming to nought, and that we are winning
    over to our policy of peace a steadily increasing number of states
    which are undoubtedly hostile towards the Soviets. The number of
    countries that have signed peace treaties is increasing, and there
    is every probability that a final peace treaty with Poland will be
    signed in the immediate future. Thus, another severe blow will be
    struck at the alliance of the capitalist forces which are trying
    to wrench the power of government from us by means of war. </p>
 
    <p>Comrades, you also know, of course, that the temporary setbacks
    we suffered in the war with Poland and the difficulty of our
    position at certain moments of the war were due to our being
    obliged to fight Wrangel, who was officially recognised by one
    imperialist power,<a id="bk01" href="#fw01" name="bk01"><sup
    class="enote">[1]</sup></a> and received vast material, military
    and other aid. To end the war as quickly as possible, we had to
    effect a rapid concentration of troops so as to strike a decisive
    blow at Wrangel. You, of course, know what dauntless heroism was
    displayed by the Red Army in surmounting obstacles and
    fortifications which even military experts and military
    authorities considered impregnable. The complete, decisive and
    remarkably swift victory the Red Army gained over Wrangel is one
    of the most brilliant pages in its history. That was how the war
    forced on us by the whiteguards and the imperialists ended.</p>

    <p>It is with far greater assurance and determination that we can
    now set about a task that is dear to us, an essential task, one
    that has long been attracting us&#8212;that of economic
    development. We can do so with the assurance that the capitalist
    tycoons will not find it as easy to frustrate this work as in the
    past. Of course, we must be on our guard. In no case can we say
    that we are already guaranteed against war. It is not because of
    the absence of formal peace treaties that we are still without
    that guarantee. We are very well aware that the remnants of
    Wrangel&#8217;s army have not been destroyed, that they are lying
    low close at hand, that they are under ward and tutelage, and are
    being re-formed with the aid of the capitalist powers. We know
    that the white-guard Russian organisations are working actively to
    re-create certain military units and, together with
    Wrangel&#8217;s forces, to prepare them for a new onslaught on
    Russia at a favourable moment.</p>

    <p>That is why we must maintain our military preparedness under
    all circumstances. Irrespective of the blows already struck at
    imperialism, we must keep our Red Army in a state of combat
    readiness at all costs, and increase its fighting efficiency. The
    release of a certain section of the army and its rapid
    demobilisation does not, of course, militate against this. We rely
    on the tremendous experience gained by the Red Army and its
    leaders during the war to enable us now to improve its
    quality. And we shall see to it that although the army is reduced
    we shall retain a cadre whose maintenance will not entail an undue
    burden on the Republic, while at the same time, with the reduction
    in the number of effectives, we shall be in a better position than
    before, in case of need, to mobilise and equip a still larger
    military force.</p>

    <p>We are certain that all the neighbouring states, which have
    already lost a great deal by supporting the whiteguard
    conspiracies against us, have learnt the hard lesson of experience
    and have duly appreciated our conciliatory spirit, which was
    generally considered as weakness on our part. Three years of
    experience have no doubt shown them that, while we are
    persistently striving for peace, we are prepared from the military
    point of view. Any attempt to start a war against us will mean, to
    the states involved, that the terms they will get following such a
    war will be worse than those they could have obtained without a
    war or prior to it. This has been proved in respect of several
    countries. This is an achievement we shall not forego, one that
    will not be forgotten by any of the powers surrounding us or in
    political contact with Russia. Thanks to this, our relations with
    neighbouring countries are steadily improving. You know that a
    final peace has been signed with a number of states bordering on
    the Western frontiers of Russia. These were part of the former
    Russian Empire, and the Soviet government has unequivocally
    recognised their independence and sovereignty, in conformity with
    the fundamental principles of our policy. Peace on such a basis
    has every chance of being far more durable than is to the liking
    of the capitalists and certain West-European states.</p>

    <p>As regards the Latvian Government, I must say that at one time
    there was a danger of our relations becoming strained, so much so
    that the idea even arose of severing diplomatic relations. But the
    latest report from our representative in Latvia indicates that a
    change of policy has already taken place, and that many
    misunderstandings and legitimate causes of dissatisfaction have
    been removed. There is good reason to hope that in the near future
    we shall have close economic ties with Latvia, which will
    naturally be even more useful to us in our trade with Western
    Europe than Estonia and the other states bordering on the
    R.S.F.S.R.</p>

    <p>I must also say, comrades, that during this year our policy in
    the East has been very successful. We must welcome the formation
    and consolidation of the Soviet Republics of Bokhara, Azerbaijan
    and Armenia, which have not only recovered their complete
    independence, but have placed the power of government in the hands
    of the workers and peasants. These republics are proof and
    corroboration of the fact that the ideas and principles of Soviet
    government are understood and immediately applicable, not only in
    the industrially developed countries, not only in those which have
    a social basis like the proletariat, but also in those which have
    the peasantry as their basis. The idea of peasants&#8217; Soviets
    has triumphed. The peasants&#8217; power has been assured: they
    own the land and the means of production. The friendly relations
    between the peasant Soviet Republics and the Russian Socialist
    Republic have already been consolidated by the practical results
    of our policy. </p>
 
    <p>We can also welcome the forthcoming signing of a treaty with
    Persia,<a id="bk02" href="#fw02" name="bk02"><sup
    class="enote">[2]</sup></a> friendly relations with whom are
    assured by the fact that the fundamental interests of all peoples
    suffering from the yoke of imperialism coincide.</p>

    <p>We must also note that friendly relations with Afghanistan, and
    still more so with Turkey, are being steadily established and
    strengthened. As for the latter power, the Entente countries have
    done everything they could to render impossible any more or less
    normal relations between her and the West-European countries. This
    circumstance, coupled with consolidation of the Soviets, is
    steadily strengthening the alliance and the friendly relations
    between Russia and the oppressed nations of the East, despite the
    bourgeoisie&#8217;s resistance and intrigues and the continuing
    encirclement of Russia by bourgeois countries. The chief factor in
    politics today is the violence being used by the imperialists
    against peoples which have not had the good fortune to be among
    the victors; this world policy of imperialism is leading to closer
    relations, alliance and friendship among all the oppressed
    nations. The success we have achieved in this respect in the West
    as well, in relation to more Europeanised states, goes to show
    that the present principles of our foreign policy are correct and
    that the improvement in our international position rests on a firm
    basis. We are confident that, by continuing our peace policy and
    by making concessions (and we must do so if we wish to avoid war),
    the basic line of our policy and the fundamental interests which
    stem from the very nature of imperialist policy will come into
    their own and will make it more and more imperative for the
    R.S.F.S.R. to establish closer relations with a growing number of
    neighbouring states, despite the intrigues and machinations of the
    imperialists, who, of course, are always capable of provoking a
    quarrel between us and some other state. Such relations are our
    guarantee that we shall be able to devote ourselves
    whole-heartedly to economic development and that we shall be able,
    for a longer period, to work calmly, steadfastly and
    confidently.</p>

    <p>I must add that negotiations for the conclusion of a trade
    agreement with Great Britain are now under way. Unfortunately,
    these negotiations have been dragging out much longer than we
    would wish, but we are not at all to blame for that. When, as far
    back as July&#8212;at the moment the Soviet troops were achieving
    their greatest successes&#8212;the British Government officially
    submitted to us the text of an agreement assuring the
    establishment of trade relations, we replied by giving our full
    consent, but since then the conflict of the various trends within
    the British Government and the British state has held this up. We
    see how the British Government is vacillating, and is threatening
    to sever relations with us and immediately to dispatch warships to
    Petrograd. We have seen all this, but at the same time we have
    seen that, in reply to this threat, Councils of Action have sprung
    up all over Great Britain. We have seen how, under pressure from
    the workers, the most extreme adherents of the opportunist trend
    and their leaders have been obliged to resort to this quite
    &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221; policy, one that they had
    themselves condemned a short while before. It appears that,
    despite the Menshevik prejudices which have hitherto prevailed in
    the British trade union movement, the pressure brought to bear by
    the working people and their political consciousness have become
    strong enough to blunt the edge of the imperialists&#8217;
    bellicose policy. Continuing our policy of peace, we have taken
    our stand on the proposals made by the British Government in
    July. We are prepared to sign a trade agreement at once; if it has
    not yet been signed, the blame rests wholly with those trends and
    tendencies in British ruling circles that are anxious to frustrate
    the trade agreement and, against the will of the majority, not
    only of the workers but even of the British bourgeoisie, want a
    free hand to attack Soviet Russia again. That is their affair.</p>

    <p>The longer this policy is pursued by certain influential
    circles in Great Britain, by financial and imperialist circles
    there, the more it will aggravate the financial situation, the
    longer it will delay the semi-agreement which has now become
    essential between bourgeois Britain and the Soviet Republic, and
    the nearer it will bring the imperialists to a situation that will
    oblige them to accept a full agreement, not merely a
    semi-agreement.</p>

    <p>Comrades, I must say that this trade agreement with Great
    Britain is connected with one of the most important questions in
    our economic policy, that of concessions. One of the important
    acts passed by the Soviet government during the period under
    review is the law on concessions of November 23, this year. You
    are, of course, all familiar with the text of this law. You all
    know that we have now published additional material, from which
    delegates to the Congress of Soviets can obtain full information
    on this question. We have published a special pamphlet containing,
    not only the text of the decree but also a list of the chief
    concessions we are offering: agricultural, timber and mining. We
    have taken steps to make the published text of this decree
    available in the West-European countries as early as possible, and
    we hope that our concessions policy will also be a practical
    success. We do not in the least close our eyes to the dangers this
    policy presents to the Socialist Soviet Republic, a country that,
    moreover, is weak and backward. While our Soviet Republic remains
    the isolated borderland of the capitalist world, it would be
    absolutely ridiculous, fantastic and utopian to hope that we can
    achieve complete economic independence and that all dangers will
    vanish. Of course, as long as the radical contrasts remain, the
    dangers will also remain, and there is no escaping them. What we
    have to do is to get firmly on our feet in order to survive these
    dangers; we must be able to distinguish between big dangers and
    little dangers, and incur the lesser dangers rather than the
    greater.</p>

    <p>We were recently informed that, at a Congress of Soviets of
    Arzamas Uyezd in Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, a peasant, not a member
    of the Party, said on the subject of concessions: &#8220;Comrades,
    we are delegating you to the All-Russia Congress and declare that
    we peasants are prepared to endure hunger and cold and do our duty
    for another three years, but don&#8217;t sell Mother Russia in the
    form of concessions.&#8221; I heartily welcome such sentiments,
    which are very widespread. I think it is highly indicative that
    during these three years the masses of non-Party working
    people&#8212;not only industrial workers but peasants as
    well&#8212;have acquired the political and economic experience
    which enables and compels them to value their liberation from the
    capitalists above all else, which compels them to exercise
    redoubled caution and to treat with extreme suspicion every step
    that involves the possibility of new dangers of the restoration of
    capitalism. Of course, we give the greatest consideration to all
    declarations of this kind, but we must say that there is no
    question of selling out Russia to the capitalists. It is a
    question of concessions; any concessions agreement is limited to a
    definite period and by definite terms. It is hedged around with
    all possible guarantees, by guarantees that have been carefully
    considered and will be considered and discussed with you again and
    again, at the present Congress and at various other
    conferences. These temporary agreements have nothing to do with
    any selling out. There is not a hint in them of selling
    Russia. What they do represent is a certain economic concession to
    the capitalists, the purpose of which is to enable us, as soon as
    possible, to secure the necessary machinery and locomotives
    without which we cannot effect the restoration of our economy. We
    have no right to neglect anything that may, in however small a
    measure, help us to improve the conditions of the workers and
    peasants.</p>

    <p>We must do all we possibly can to bring about the rapid
    restoration of trade relations, and negotiations are at present
    being carried on in a semi-legal framework. We are ordering
    locomotives and machines in far from adequate numbers, but we have
    begun to order them. When we conduct these negotiations
    officially, the possibilities will be vastly expanded. With the
    aid of industry we shall achieve a great deal, and in a shorter
    period; but even if the achievements are very great, the period
    will cover years, a number of years. It must be borne in mind that
    although we have now gained a military victory and have secured
    peace, history teaches us that no big question has ever been
    settled, and no revolution accomplished, without a series of
    wars. And we shall not forget this lesson. We have already taught
    a number of powerful countries not to wage war on us, but we
    cannot guarantee that this will be for long. The imperialist
    predators will attack us again if there is the slightest change in
    the situation. We must be prepared for it. Hence, the first thing
    is to restore the economy and place it firmly on its feet. Without
    equipment, without machinery obtained from capitalist countries,
    we cannot do this rapidly. And we should not grudge the capitalist
    a little extra profit if only we can effect this restoration. The
    workers and peasants must share the sentiments of those non-Party
    peasants who have declared that they are not afraid to face
    sacrifice and privation. Realising the danger of capitalist
    intervention, they do not regard concessions from a sentimental
    point of view, but as a continuation of the war, as the transfer
    of the ruthless struggle to another plane; they see in them the
    possibility of fresh attempts on the part of the bourgeoisie to
    restore the old capitalism. That is splendid; it is a guarantee
    that not only the organs of Soviet power but all the workers and
    peasants will make it their business to keep watch and ward over
    our interests. We are, therefore, confident that we shall be able
    to place the protection of our interests on such a basis that the
    restoration of the power of the capitalists will be totally out of
    the question even in carrying out the concessions agreements; we
    shall do everything to reduce the danger to a minimum, and make it
    less than the danger of war, so that it will be difficult to
    resume the war and easier for us to restore and develop our
    economy in a shorter period, in fewer years (and it is a matter of
    a good many years).</p>

    <p>Comrades, economic tasks, the economic front, are again and
    again assuming prominence as the chief and fundamental
    factor. While studying the texts of the various laws on which I
    have to report to you, I saw that the vast majority of the
    measures and decisions of the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars
    and the Council of Defence consist at present of specific,
    detailed and frequently minute measures connected with this
    economic activity. You, of course, do not expect me to give you a
    list of these measures. It would be extremely tedious and quite
    uninteresting. I should only like to remind you that this is by no
    means the first time that we are attaching primary importance to
    the labour front. Let us recall the resolution passed by the
    All-Russia Central Executive Committee on April 29, 1918.<a
    id="bk03" href="#fw03" name="bk03"><sup
    class="enote">[3]</sup></a> That was a time when Russia was
    economically dismembered by the Peace of Brest-Litovsk that was
    forced upon us, and when this extremely rapacious treaty had
    placed us in an extremely difficult position. It then appeared
    possible to count on a respite which would create conditions for
    the restoration of peaceful economic activities,
    and&#8212;although we now know that this respite was a very brief
    one&#8212;the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, in its
    resolution of April 29, at once focussed all attention on economic
    development. This resolution, which has not been rescinded and
    remains one of our laws, provides a proper perspective, enabling
    us to judge how we approached this task and to what we must now
    devote greater attention in the interests of our work and in order
    to complete it successfully.</p>

    <p>An examination of this resolution clearly shows that many of
    the problems we now have to tackle were presented in a clear-cut,
    firm and sufficiently decisive way as far back as April
    1918. Remembering this, we say that repetition is the mother of
    learning. We are not dismayed by our having to repeat the basic
    axioms of economic development. We shall repeat them time and
    again, but see what a difference there is between the declaration
    of abstract principles in 1918 and the practical economic work
    that has already been begun. Despite the tremendous difficulties
    and the constant interruptions in our work, we are approaching
    closer and closer lo a concrete and practical solution of our
    economic problems. We shall repeat things over and over again. In
    constructive work you cannot avoid a vast number of repetitions,
    or avoid turning back every now and again, testing what you have
    done, making certain corrections, adopting new methods, and
    bending every effort to convince the backward and the
    untrained.</p>

    <p>The essential feature of the present political situation is
    that we are now passing through a crucial period of transition,
    something of a zigzag transition from war to economic
    development. This has occurred before, but not on such a wide
    scale. This should constantly remind us of what the general
    political tasks of the Soviet government are, and what constitutes
    the particular feature of this transition. The dictatorship of the
    proletariat has been successful because it has been able to
    combine compulsion with persuasion. The dictatorship of the
    proletariat does not fear any resort to compulsion and to the most
    severe, decisive and ruthless forms of coercion by the state. The
    advanced class, the class most oppressed by capitalism, is
    entitled to use compulsion, because it is doing so in the
    interests of the working and exploited people, and because it
    possesses means of compulsion and persuasion such as no former
    classes ever possessed, although they had incomparably greater
    material facilities for propaganda and agitation than we have.</p>

    <p>If we ask ourselves what the results of our experience in these
    three years have been (for it is difficult, on certain fundamental
    points, to sum up the results of a single year), if we ask
    ourselves how, after all, our victory over an enemy much stronger
    than ourselves is to be explained, it must be said that it was
    because the organisation of the Red Army splendidly embodied the
    consistency and firmness of proletarian leadership in the alliance
    of the workers and the working peasantry against all
    exploiters. What was the reason? Why did the vast masses of the
    peasantry willingly consent to this? Because they were convinced,
    though their vast majority were not Party members, that there was
    no way of salvation except by supporting the Soviet government. It
    was, of course, not books that convinced them of this, nor was it
    propaganda. It was all through experience. They were convinced by
    the experience of the Civil War, in particular by the alliance
    between our Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, which is
    more closely akin to certain fundamental features of small-scale
    peasant economy. Their experience of the alliance between these
    parties of the small property-owners and the landowners and the
    capitalists, and their experience of Kolchak and Denikin,
    convinced the peasant masses that no middle course was possible,
    that the plain and straightforward Soviet policy was the right
    one, and that the iron leadership of the proletariat was their
    only means of salvation from exploitation and violence. It has
    been only because of our ability to convince the peasants of this
    that our policy of coercion, which is based on this firm and
    absolute conviction, has met with such tremendous success.</p>

    <p>We must now bear in mind that, in going over to the labour
    front, we are faced with the same problem, under new conditions
    and on a much wider scale, that confronted us when we were
    fighting the whiteguards and witnessed a degree of enthusiasm and
    concentration of energy on the part of the worker and peasant
    masses such as has never been, and never could have been,
    displayed in any war in any other state. From their own
    observations and their knowledge of life, the non-Party peasants,
    like the Arzamas peasant whose words I have just quoted, did
    really come to the conclusion that the exploiters are ruthless
    enemies and that a ruthless state power is required to crush
    them. We succeeded in rousing unprecedented numbers of people to
    display an intelligent attitude towards the war, and to support it
    actively. Never before, under any political regime, has there been
    even one-tenth of the sympathy with a war and an understanding of
    it as that unanimously displayed by our Party and non Party
    workers and non-Party peasants (and the mass of the peasants are
    non-Party) under Soviet power. That is the main reason for our
    having ultimately defeated a powerful enemy. That is corroboration
    of one of the most profound and at the same time most simple and
    comprehensible precepts of Marxism. The greater the scope and
    extent of historical events, the greater is the number of people
    participating in them, and, contrariwise, the more profound the
    change we wish to bring about, the more must we rouse an interest
    and an intelligent attitude towards it, and convince more millions
    and tens of millions of people that it is necessary. In the final
    analysis, the reason our revolution has left all other revolutions
    far behind is that, through the Soviet form of government, it has
    aroused tens of millions of people, formerly uninterested in state
    development, to take an active part in the work of building up the
    state. Let us now consider, from this aspect, the new tasks which
    confronted us and were expressed in tens and hundreds of decisions
    passed by the Soviet government during this period; they accounted
    for nine-tenths of the work of the Council of Labour and Defence
    (we shall speak of this later), and probably more than half of the
    work of the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars, namely, the
    economic tasks, the elaboration of a single economic plan, the
    reorganisation of the very foundations of the economy of Russia,
    the very foundations of small-scale peasant economy. These tasks
    require that all members of trade unions, without exception,
    should be drawn into this absolutely new work, something that was
    alien to them under capitalism. Now ask yourselves whether we at
    present have the condition for the rapid and unequivocal success
    that we had during the war, the condition of the masses being
    drawn into the work. Are the members of the trade unions and the
    majority of the non-Party people convinced that our new methods
    and our great tasks of economic development are necessary? Are
    they as convinced of this as they were of the necessity of
    devoting everything to the war, of sacrificing everything for the
    sake of victory on the war front? If the question is presented in
    that way, you will be compelled to answer that they are certainly
    not. They are far from being as fully convinced of this as they
    should be.</p>

    <p>War was a matter which people understood and were used to for
    hundreds and thousands of years. The acts of violence and
    brutality formerly committed by the landowners were so obvious
    that it was easy to convince the people; it was not difficult to
    convince even the peasants of the richer grain regions, who are
    least connected with industry, that we were waging war in the
    interests of the working people, and it was therefore possible to
    arouse almost universal enthusiasm. It will be more difficult to
    get the peasant masses and the members of the trade unions to
    understand these tasks now, to get them to understand that we
    cannot go on living in the old way, that however firmly capitalist
    exploitation has been implanted in the course of decades, it must
    be overcome. We must get everybody to understand that Russia
    belongs to us, and that only we, the masses of workers and
    peasants, can by our activities and our strict labour discipline
    remould the old economic conditions of existence and put a great
    economic plan into practice. There can be no salvation apart from
    this. We are lagging behind the capitalist powers and shall
    continue to lag behind them; we shall be defeated if we do not
    succeed in restoring our economy. That is why we must repeat the
    old truths I have just reminded you of, the old truths regarding
    the importance of organisational problems, of labour discipline,
    regarding the immense role of the trade unions&#8212;an absolutely
    exclusive role in this sphere, because there is no other
    organisation which unites the broad masses; that is why we must
    not only repeat these old truths, but must with every fibre of our
    being realise that the transition from military tasks to economic
    tasks has begun.</p>

    <p>We have been completely successful in the military sphere, and
    we must now prepare to achieve similar successes in tasks which
    are more difficult and which demand enthusiasm and self-sacrifice
    from the vast majority of workers and peasants. The conviction
    that the new tasks are necessary must be instilled in hundreds of
    millions of people who from generation to generation have lived in
    a state of slavery and oppression and whose every initiative has
    been suppressed. We must convince the millions of workers who
    belong to trade unions but who are still not politically conscious
    and are unaccustomed to regarding themselves as masters. They must
    be organised, not to resist the government but to support and
    develop the measures of their workers&#8217; government and to
    carry them out to the full. This transition will be accompanied by
    difficulties. Regarded merely as a formulation, it is not a new
    task; it is a new task insofar as the economic problem is being
    raised on such a vast scale for the first time; we must realise
    and remember that the war on the economic front will be more
    difficult and prolonged. To achieve success on this front, a
    larger number of workers and peasants must be educated to be
    self-reliant, active and devoted. This can be done, as is borne
    out by the experience we have gained in economic development,
    because the masses fully realise that the misfortunes, cold,
    hunger and privation have been caused by the inadequacy of our
    productive forces. We must now transfer all our agitation and
    propaganda from political and military interests to economic
    development. We have proclaimed this many times, but
    insufficiently; it seems to me that the most outstanding measures
    adopted by the Soviet government during the past year are the
    creation of the Central Bureau for Production Propaganda of the
    All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions,<a id="bk04"
    href="#fw04" name="bk04"><sup class="enote">[4]</sup></a> the
    amalgamation of its work with that of the Chief Committee for
    Political Education, and the publication of additional newspapers
    for the respective industries, which are to devote attention, not
    only to production propaganda but also to its organisation on a
    country-wide scale.</p>

    <p>The necessity of organising production propaganda on a
    nation-wide scale follows from the special features of the
    political situation. It is equally necessary to the working class,
    the trade unions, and the peasantry. It is absolutely essential to
    our state apparatus, which we have used far from enough for this
    purpose. We have a thousand times more knowledge, book knowledge,
    of how to run industry and how to interest the masses than is
    being applied in practice. We must see to it that literally every
    member of the trade unions becomes interested in production, and
    remembers that only by increasing production and raising labour
    productivity will Soviet Russia be in a state to win. Only in this
    way will Soviet Russia be able to shorten by about ten years the
    period of the frightful conditions she is now experiencing, the
    hunger and cold she is now suffering. If we do not understand this
    task, we may all perish, because we shall have to retreat owing to
    the weakness of our apparatus, since, after a short respite, the
    capitalists may at any moment renew the war, while we shall not be
    in a state to continue it. We shall not be able to bring the
    pressure of the millions of our masses to bear, and in this last
    war we shall be smashed. That is how the matter stands. Hitherto,
    the fate of all revolutions, of all great revolutions, has been
    decided by a long series of wars. Our revolution too is such a
    great revolution. We have passed through one period of wars, and
    we must prepare for another. We do not know when it will come, but
    we must see to it that when it does come we shall be prepared for
    all contingencies. That is why we must not give up measures of
    compulsion, and not merely because we are preserving the
    dictatorship of the proletariat, which the mass of peasants and
    non-Party workers already understand. They know all about our
    dictatorship, and it holds out no terrors to them. It does not
    frighten them. They regard it as a bulwark and a stronghold, that
    is, something with which they can resist the landowners and
    capitalists, and without which victory is impossible. 

    </p>
    <p> 
      This realisation, this conviction, which has already become
      deep-rooted among the peasant masses as far as military and
      political tasks are concerned, must now be extended to economic
      problems. We may not, perhaps, succeed in bringing about this
      transition at once. It may, possibly, not be effected without
      certain vacillations and reversions to the old flabbiness and
      petty-bourgeois ideology. We must tackle this work with still
      greater energy and zeal, remembering that we can convince the
      non-Party peasants and insufficiently class-conscious trade
      union members, because the truth is on our side, and because it
      cannot be denied that in the second period of wars we shall not
      be able to defeat our enemies unless the country&#8217;s economy
      is restored. Let us only see to it that the millions take a more
      enlightened attitude towards the war on the economic front. This
      is the task of the Central Bureau of Production Propaganda, the
      task of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions, the task
      of all Party workers, the task of all the departments of the
      Soviet government, the task of all our propaganda, with the help
      of which we have secured successes of world wide significance,
      because our propaganda throughout the world has always told the
      workers and peasants the truth, while all other propaganda tells
      them lies. We must now switch our propaganda over to something
      which is far more difficult and concerns the everyday work of
      the workers in the factory shop, no matter how difficult the
      conditions of this work may be, and no matter how strong the
      memories of the old capitalist system may be, which taught the
      workers and peasants to mistrust governments. We must convince
      both workers and peasants that, without a new combination of
      forces, new forms of state amalgamation, and the new forms
      associated with compulsion, we shall not cope with our
      difficulties, and we shall not escape the abyss of economic
      collapse on the brink of which we are standing&#8212;and we have
      already begun to cope with the situation.</p>

    <p>Comrades, I shall now deal with certain facts of our economic
    policy and the economic problems which seem to me to be
    characteristic of the present political situation and of the
    transition now confronting us. I must first mention our agrarian
    bill, the bill of the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars for the
    consolidation and development of agricultural production and for
    assistance to peasant farms. This bill was published on December
    14 of this year, and before that date the substance and principles
    of it were communicated to all local officials by wireless.</p>

    <p>Arrangements should at once be made to have this bill
    thoroughly discussed&#8212;in the light of local experience (on
    which it is actually based), and this is being done in the
    localities&#8212;by the Congress and also by the representatives
    of the local Executive Committees and the departments of the
    latter. I think that no comrade now doubts the necessity of
    specific and very energetic measures of assistance&#8212;not only
    in the form of encouragement but also in the form of
    compulsion&#8212;to improve our agricultural production.</p>

    <p>Our country has been and still is a country of small peasants,
    and the transition to communism is far more difficult for us than
    it would be under any other conditions. To accomplish this
    transition, the peasants&#8217; participation in it must be ten
    times as much as in the war. The war could demand, and was bound
    to demand, part of the adult male population. However, our
    country, a land of peasants which is still in a state of
    exhaustion, has to mobilise the entire male and female population
    of workers and peasants without exception. It is not difficult to
    convince us Communists, workers in the Land Departments, that
    state labour conscription is necessary. In the discussion of the
    bill of December 14, which has been submitted for your
    consideration, I hope that on this point there will not be even a
    shadow of difference in principle. We must realise that there is
    another difficulty, that of convincing the non-Party peasants. The
    peasants are not socialists. To base our socialist plans on the
    assumption that they are would be building on sand; it would mean
    that we do not understand our tasks and that, during these three
    years, we have not learnt to adjust our programmes and carry out
    our new undertakings with due account of the poverty and often
    squalor that surround us. We must have a clear picture of the
    problems that face us. The first task is to unite the Communists
    working in the Land Departments, draw general conclusions from
    their experience, grasp what has been done in the localities, and
    embody it in the legislative acts which will be promulgated at the
    centre, by government departments, and by the All-Russia Congress
    of Soviets. We hope that we shall be able to do that. However,
    that is only the first step. The second step is to convince the
    non-Party peasants, yes, the non-Party peasants, because they form
    the majority and because what we are in a position to do can be
    done only by making this mass, which is in itself active and full
    of initiative, realise to a greater degree that the task must be
    tackled. Peasant farming cannot continue in the old way. While we
    were able to extricate ourselves from the first period of wars, we
    shall not extricate ourselves so easily from the second period,
    and must therefore pay special attention to this aspect.</p>

    <p>Every non-Party peasant must be made to understand this
    undoubted truth, and we are sure that he will understand it. He
    has not lived through these last six painful and difficult years
    in vain. He is not like the pre-war muzhik. He has suffered
    severely, has done a lot of thinking, and has borne many political
    and economic hardships that have induced him to give up a good
    deal of their old habits. It seems to me that he already realises
    that he cannot live in the old way, that he must live in a
    different way. All our means of propaganda, all the resources of
    the state, all our educational facilities and all our Party
    resources and reserves must be devoted in full force to convincing
    the non-Party peasant. Only then will our agrarian
    bill&#8212;which I hope you will adopt unanimously, with necessary
    amendments and addenda, of course&#8212;be placed on a sound
    basis. Only when we convince the majority of the peasants and draw
    them into this work will this measure become just as firm as our
    policy is. That is because&#8212;as Comrade Kurayev has rightly
    said in an article based on the experience of the Tatar
    Republic&#8212;the working middle peasant and poor peasant are
    friends of the Soviet government, while the idlers are its
    enemies. That is the real truth, a truth in which there is nothing
    socialist, but which is so indisputable and obvious that any
    village assembly and any meeting of non-Party peasants will
    understand it, and it will become the conviction of the
    overwhelming majority of the working peasants.</p>

    <p>Comrades, here is what I particularly want to bring home to you
    now that we have turned from the phase of war to economic
    development. In a country of small peasants, our chief and basic
    task is to be able to resort to state compulsion in order to raise
    the level of peasant farming, beginning with measures that are
    absolutely essential, urgent and fully intelligible and
    comprehensible to the peasant. We shall be able to achieve this
    only when we are able to convince more millions of people who are
    not yet ready for it. We must devote all our forces to this and
    see to it that the apparatus of compulsion, activated and
    reinforced, shall be adapted and developed for a new drive of
    persuasion. Another campaign in the war will then end in
    victory. We are now declaring war on the relics of inertness,
    ignorance and mistrust that prevail among the peasant masses. We
    shall achieve nothing by the old methods, but we shall achieve
    victory by the methods of propaganda, agitation and organised
    influence which we have learnt. We shall also see to it that,
    besides decrees being adopted, institutions created and documents
    written&#8212;it is not enough to send orders flying all over the
    country&#8212;all the fields are sown better than before by the
    spring, and a definite improvement is achieved in small peasant
    farming. Let it be even the most elementary improvement&#8212;the
    more cautious we are the better&#8212;but it must be achieved at
    all costs and on a mass scale. If we correctly understand the task
    that faces us, and if we devote our whole attention to the
    non-Party peasant, and concentrate on this all the skill and
    experience we have gained during these three years, we shall
    succeed. And unless we succeed, unless we achieve a practical and
    massive improvement in small-scale peasant farming, there is no
    salvation for us. Unless this basis is created, no economic
    development will be possible and the most ambitious plans will be
    valueless. The comrades must remember this and must bring it home
    to the peasants. They must tell the non-Party peasants of
    Arzamas&#8212;and there are about ten or fifteen million of
    them&#8212;that we cannot go on starving and freezing endlessly,
    for then we shall be overthrown in the next period of wars. This
    is a state matter; it concerns the interests of our state. Whoever
    reveals the least weakness, the least slackness in this matter, is
    an out-and-out criminal towards the workers&#8217; and
    peasants&#8217; government; he is helping the landowner and the
    capitalist. And the landowner and the capitalist have their armies
    nearby, holding them in readiness to launch against us the instant
    they see us weakening. There is no way to strengthen ourselves
    otherwise than by building up our main bulwark&#8212;agriculture
    and urban industry. These cannot be improved except by convincing
    the non-Party peasant of the need to do so, by mobilising all our
    forces to help him, and by actually helping him in practice.</p>

    <p>We admit that we are in debt to the peasant. We have had grain
    from him in return for paper money, and have taken it from him on
    credit. We must repay that debt, and we shall do so when we have
    restored our industry. To restore it we need a surplus of
    agricultural products. That is why the agrarian bill is important,
    not only because we must secure practical results, but also
    because around it, as on a focal point, are grouped hundreds of
    decisions and legislative measures of the Soviet government.</p>

    <p>I now pass on to the question of how the basis for our
    industrial development is being created to enable us to begin
    restoring Russia&#8217;s economic forces. In this connection I
    must first draw your attention&#8212;from among the mass of
    reports which you have received or will receive in the next few
    days from all the Commissariats&#8212;to a passage in the report
    of our Commissariat of Food. In the next few days each
    Commissariat will present you with a profusion of figures and
    reports, which taken together are overwhelming in their
    abundance. We must extract from them what is most essential to
    success, however modest it may be, and what is fundamental for the
    realisation of our economic plan, for the restoration of our
    economy and our industry. One of these essentials is the state of
    our food procurements. In the booklet which has been distributed
    to you&#8212;the report of the Commissariat of Food for three
    years&#8212;you will find a table from which I shall read only the
    totals, and even those in round figures, because reading figures,
    and particularly listening to figures, is a difficult
    matter. These are the figures showing the total procurements for
    each year. From August 1, 1916 to August 1, 1917, 320,000,000
    poods were procured; 50,000,000 were procured in the following
    year, then 100,000,000 and then 200,000,000 poods. These
    figures&#8212;320, 50, 100 and 200&#8212;give you the basis of the
    economic history of Soviet government, of the work of the Soviet
    government in the economic field, the preparations for that
    foundation which, when laid down, will enable us to really start
    developing. The pre-revolutionary 320,000,000 poods is the
    approximate minimum without which development is impossible. In
    the first year of the revolution, with only 50,000,000 poods,
    there was starvation, cold and poverty. In the second year we had
    100,000,000 poods; in the third year, 200,000,000 poods. The total
    has doubled with each year. According to figures I received
    yesterday from Svidersky, we had 155,000,000 poods on December
    15. We are beginning to stand on our feet for the first time, but
    with the utmost efforts, with unparalleled difficulties, very
    often having to accomplish the task without any supplies from
    Siberia, the Caucasus and the South. At present, with a
    procurement of over 150,000,000 poods, we can say without any
    exaggeration that despite the tremendous difficulties, this task
    has been accomplished. We shall have a total of about 300,000,000
    poods, perhaps more. Without such a supply, however, it will be
    impossible to restore the country&#8217;s industry; it will be
    hopeless to expect the revival of the transport system and it will
    be impossible even to approach the great task of electrifying
    Russia. There can be no socialist country, no state with a
    workers&#8217; and peasants&#8217; government unless, by the joint
    efforts of the workers and peasants, it can accumulate a stock of
    food sufficient to guarantee the subsistence of the workers
    engaged in industry and to make it possible to send tens and
    hundreds of thousands of workers wherever the Soviet government
    deems it necessary. Without this there can be nothing but empty
    talk. Food stocks are the real basis of the economic system. In
    this we have achieved a signal success. Having achieved this
    success and with such a reserve, we can set about restoring our
    economy. We know that these successes have been achieved at the
    cost of tremendous privation, hunger and lack of cattle fodder
    among the peasants, which may become still more acute. We know
    that the year of drought increased the hardships and privations of
    the peasants to an unparalleled extent. We therefore lay prime
    stress on the measures of assistance contained in the bill I have
    referred to. We regard stocks of food as a fund for the
    restoration of industry, as a fund for helping the
    peasants. Without such a fund the state power is nothing. Without
    such a fund socialist policy is but a pious wish. </p>
 
    <p>We must remember that the production propaganda which we have
    firmly decided to launch will be supplemented with a different
    kind of persuasion, namely, bonuses in kind.<a id="bk05"
    href="#fw05" name="bk05"><sup class="enote">[5]</sup></a> The law
    on bonuses in kind has been one of the most important decrees and
    decisions of the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars and the
    Council of Defence. We were not able to pass this law
    immediately. If you examine the matter, you will find that ever
    since April there has been a long chain of decisions and
    resolutions, and that this law was passed only when, as the result
    of strenuous efforts on the part of our transport system, we were
    able to accumulate a food reserve of 500,000 poods. Five hundred
    thousand poods is a very modest figure. The reports which you no
    doubt read in <em>Izvestia</em> yesterday show that out of these
    500,000 poods 170,000 poods have already been expended. As you see
    the reserve is nothing to boast of, and is far from adequate;
    nevertheless, we have entered on a road along which we shall
    advance. It is proof that we are not relying on persuasion alone
    in the transition to new methods of work. It is not enough to tell
    the peasants and the workers to maintain the utmost labour
    discipline. We must also help them; we must reward those who,
    after suffering tremendous hardships, continue to display heroism
    on the labour front. We have already created a reserve fund, but
    it is being utilised in a way that is far from satisfactory. We in
    the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars have numerous indications
    that in practice a bonus in kind often amounts simply to an
    increase in wages. A good deal still remains to be done in this
    respect. The work of conferences and of drafting supplementary
    schemes at the centre must be coupled with very important work of
    another kind, namely, on the spot and among the masses. When the
    state not only persuades, but also rewards good workers by
    creating better living conditions for them, that is something that
    is not hard to understand; one does not have to be a socialist to
    understand it, and here we are assured in advance of the sympathy
    of the non-Party masses of workers and peasants. We have only to
    make this idea much more widely known and to organise this work in
    a more practical way in the localities.</p>

    <p>Now with regard to fuel; you will find in Comrade Rykov&#8217;s
    theses figures that show the improvement that has been achieved,
    not only in firewood, but also in oil supplies. Thanks to the
    great zeal displayed by the workers in the Azerbaijan Republic,
    the friendly relations we have established with them and the
    capable managers provided by the Supreme Council of the National
    Economy, the oil situation is now favourable, so that we are
    beginning to stand on our own feet in the matter of fuel as
    well. Coal deliveries from the Donets Basin are being increased
    from 25,000,000 poods to 50,000,000 poods per month, thanks to the
    work of the authorised commission which was sent there under the
    chairmanship of Comrade Trotsky. This commission has decided to
    send responsible and experienced men to the Donets Basin, and
    Comrade Pyatakov has now been sent there to take charge.</p>

    <p>Thus, to achieve success, we have adopted certain measures with
    regard to fuel. The Donets Basin, one of the largest sources, is
    already under our control. In the minutes of the Council of
    People&#8217;s Commissars and the Council of Defence, decisions
    may be found relating to the Donets Basin. These make reference to
    the dispatch of commissions invested with considerable powers and
    consisting of representatives of the central government and of
    local officials. We must stimulate work in the localities, and it
    appears to me that we can do so with the help of these
    commissions. You will see the results of the work of these
    commissions, which we shall continue to set up in the future. We
    must give a definite boost to fuel production, the principal
    branch of our industry.</p>

    <p>I must say that, in the matter of fuel, the hydraulic method of
    extracting peat is a great achievement. Peat is a fuel we possess
    in very large quantities, but which we have been unable to utilise
    till now because of the deplorable working conditions. This new
    method will enable us to overcome the fuel shortage, which
    presents one of the greatest dangers on our economic front. We
    shall not be able to get out of this impasse for many years to
    come, if we stick to the old methods and do not restore our
    industry and transport. The members of our Peat Committee have
    helped two Russian engineers to perfect this new invention, with
    the result that the new method is on the verge of completion. We
    are thus on the eve of a great revolution, which will be an
    important aid to us economically. It must not be forgotten that we
    possess vast deposits of peat, which we cannot utilise because we
    cannot send people to do such back-breaking work. The capitalist
    system could send people to work under such harsh conditions. In
    the capitalist state people were driven to work there by hunger,
    but in the socialist state we cannot consign people to such
    intolerable work, and nobody will go there voluntarily. The
    capitalist system did everything for the upper crust. It was not
    concerned with the lower classes.</p>

    <p>We must introduce more machines everywhere, and resort to
    machine technology as widely as possible. The extraction of peat
    by the hydraulic method, which has been so successfully promoted
    by the Supreme Council of the National Economy, makes it possible
    to extract fuel in vast quantities and eliminates the need for
    skilled workers, since even unskilled workers can perform the work
    under this method. We have produced these machines; I would advise
    the delegates to see the cinema film on peat extraction which has
    been shown in Moscow and which can be demonstrated for the
    Congress delegates. It will give you a definite idea of one of the
    means for coping with the fuel shortage. We have made the machines
    required for the new method, but we have made them badly. If we
    send our people abroad, with the establishment of trade with
    foreign countries, with even the existing semi-legal trade
    relations, the machines designed by our inventors could be made
    properly there. The number of these machines and the success
    gained in this field by the Chief Peat Committee and the Supreme
    Council of the National Economy will serve as a measure of all our
    economic achievements. Unless we overcome the fuel shortage, it
    will be impossible to win on the economic front. Vital success in
    restoring the transport system will also depend on this.</p> 
 
    <p>Incidentally, you have already seen from the theses of Comrades
    Yemshanov and Trotsky that in this field we have a real plan
    worked out for a number of years. Order No. 1042 was designed for
    a period of five years<a id="bk06" href="#fw06" name="bk06"><sup
    class="enote">[6]</sup></a> in five years we can restore our
    transport and reduce the number of broken-down locomotives. I
    should like to stress as probably the most difficult problem the
    statement made in the ninth thesis, to the effect that this period
    has already been reduced.</p>

    <p>When extensive plans appear, designed for a number of years,
    sceptics are frequently to be found who say: how can we plan for a
    number of years ahead? The best we can hope for is to do what is
    required at the moment. Comrades, we must be able to combine the
    two things; we cannot work without a long-term plan that envisages
    important achievements. The truth of this is borne out by the
    undoubted improvement in the work of the transport system. I draw
    your attention to the passage in the ninth thesis which says that
    the period for the restoration of transport was fixed at five
    years, but it has already been reduced because we are ahead of the
    schedule. The period is now being fixed at three and a half
    years. That is the way to work in the other branches of economic
    activity too. The real and practical task of the Council of Labour
    and Defence is being steadily reduced to that. We must avail
    ourselves of the progress of science and practice, and must
    steadfastly strive to get the plan fulfilled in the localities
    ahead of schedule, so that the masses will see that the long
    period separating us from the complete restoration of industry can
    be reduced in practice. It depends on us. Let us improve our
    methods in every workshop, in every railway depot, in every
    sphere, and we shall shorten this period. It is already being
    reduced. Do not be afraid of long-term plans, for without them you
    cannot achieve an economic revival; let us devote all our energies
    in the localities to their fulfilment.</p>

    <p>Economic plans must be carried out in accordance with a
    definite programme, and the increasing fulfilment of this
    programme must be noted and encouraged. The masses must not only
    realise, but also feel that the shortening of the period of
    hunger, cold and poverty depends entirely upon how quickly they
    fulfil our economic plans. The plans of the various branches of
    production must be soundly co-ordinated, and linked up so as to
    constitute the single economic plan we stand in such great need
    of.</p>

    <p>In this connection, we are confronted with the task of unifying
    the People&#8217;s Commissariats for the various branches of the
    economy under a single economic centre. We have begun to tackle
    this task and we are submitting for your consideration a decision
    of the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars and the Council of
    Labour and Defence regarding the reorganisation of the latter
    body.</p>

    <p>You will examine this project, and I trust that with the
    necessary amendments it will be adopted unanimously. Its contents
    are very modest but its significance is great, because we need a
    body which definitely knows what its position is and unites all
    economic work; it is on economic work that the chief stress is now
    being laid.</p>

    <p>This has been dealt with in the literature which appeared
    before and in connection with the Congress, in a pamphlet by
    Comrade Gusev, which, incidentally, is not as well written as his
    earlier one. The pamphlet contains a sweeping plan for the
    organisation of the Council of Labour and Defence, to which it is
    proposed to transfer many prominent workers, among whom we find
    the names of Trotsky and Rykov. I would say that we need somewhat
    fewer flights of fancy like this. We cannot burst out of an
    apparatus which it has taken three years to build up. We realise
    its immense shortcomings, of which we shall speak in detail at
    this Congress. This question has been placed on the agenda; it is
    one of the most important questions. I am referring to the
    question of improving the Soviet apparatus. But we must at present
    act with circumspection, confine ourselves to what is essential,
    and change our apparatus on the basis of practical
    experience. Comrade Gusev has derided the project we have
    submitted and says that we are proposing to add the People&#8217;s
    Commissariat of Agriculture to the Council of Labour and
    Defence. Quite right, we are proposing such a project. In it we
    assign a very modest place to the Council of Labour and Defence,
    making it a Commission of Labour and Defence under the Council of
    People&#8217;s Commissars. Until now we have been working in the
    Council of Labour and Defence without any constitution. The powers
    of the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars and the Council of
    Labour and Defence have been poorly defined; we have sometimes
    exceeded these powers and acted as a legislative body. But there
    has never been any conflict on these grounds. Such cases have been
    settled by immediately referring them to the Council of
    People&#8217;s Commissars. When it became apparent that the
    Council of Labour and Defence must be converted into a body for
    the closer co-ordination of economic policy, the question arose
    how to give legal definition to these relations. There are two
    plans before us. One of them calls for the demarcation of the
    competence of the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars and that of
    the Council of Labour and Defence. To do this, numerous codifiers
    must be engaged and reams of paper used, and even then there will
    be no guarantee that mistakes will not be made.</p>

    <p>Let us set about it in a different way. The Council of Labour
    and Defence has been regarded as something almost equal to the
    Council of People&#8217;s Commissars. Let us abandon that
    idea. Let it be a commission of the Council of People&#8217;s
    Commissars. We shall avoid a great deal of friction and shall
    achieve more rapid practical realisation. If any member of the
    Council of People&#8217;s Commissars is dissatisfied, let him
    bring his complaint before the Council of People&#8217;s
    Commissars; it can be summoned in a few hours, as you know. In
    this way we shall avoid friction between departments and will make
    the Council of Labour and Defence a rapidly acting body. That is
    no easy problem. It is bound up with the actual creation of a
    single economic plan. The problem, for the solution of which we
    have done something and for which we have been preparing for two
    years, is to achieve the unification of the Commissariats for the
    various branches of the economy. That is why I draw your attention
    to this bill on the Council of Labour and Defence, and I hope
    that, with the necessary amendments, you will endorse it. The work
    of uniting these Commissariats will then proceed more smoothly,
    rapidly, firmly and energetically.</p>

    <p>I now come to the last item&#8212;the question of
    electrification, which stands on the agenda of the Congress. You
    are to hear a report on this subject. I think that we are
    witnessing a momentous change, one which in any case marks the
    beginning of important successes for the Soviets. Henceforth the
    rostrum at All-Russia Congresses will be mounted, not only by
    politicians and administrators but also by engineers and
    agronomists. This marks the beginning of that very happy time when
    politics will recede into the background, when politics will be
    discussed less often and at shorter length, and engineers and
    agronomists will do most of the talking. To really proceed with
    the work of economic development, this custom must be initiated at
    the All-Russia Congress of Soviets and in all Soviets and
    organisations, newspapers, organs of propaganda and agitation, and
    all institutions, from top to bottom.</p>

    <p>We have, no doubt, learnt politics; here we stand as firm as a
    rock. But things are bad as far as economic matters are
    concerned. Henceforth, less politics will be the best
    politics. Bring more engineers and agronomists to the fore, learn
    from them, keep an eye on their work, and turn our congresses and
    conferences, not into propaganda meetings but into bodies that
    will verify our economic achievements, bodies in which we can
    really learn the business of economic development.</p>

    <p>You will hear the report of the State Electrification
    Commission, which was set up in conformity with the decision of
    the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of February 7, 1920. On
    February 21, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the National
    Economy signed the final ordinance determining the composition of
    the commission, and a number of leading experts and workers,
    mainly from the Supreme Council of the National Economy, over a
    hundred of them, and also from the People&#8217;s Commissariat of
    Railways and the People&#8217;s Commissariat of Agriculture, are
    devoting their entire energy to this work. We have before us the
    results of the work of the State Commission for the
    Electrification of Russia in the shape of this small volume which
    will be distributed to you today or tomorrow.<a id="bk07"
    href="#fw07" name="bk07"><sup class="enote">[7]</sup></a> I trust
    you will not be scared by this little volume. I think I shall have
    no difficulty in convincing you of the particular importance of
    this book. In my opinion it is the second programme of our
    Party. We have a Party programme which has been excellently
    explained by Comrades Preobrazhensky and Bukharin in the form of a
    book which is less voluminous, but extremely useful. That is the
    political programme; it is an enumeration of our objectives, an
    explanation of the relations between classes and masses. It must,
    however, also be realised that the time has come to take this road
    in actual fact and to measure the practical results achieved. Our
    Party programme must not remain solely a programme of the
    Party. It must become a programme of our economic development, or
    otherwise it will be valueless even as a programme of the
    Party. It must be supplemented with a second Party programme, a
    plan of work aimed at restoring our entire economy and raising it
    to the level of up-to-date technical development. Without a plan
    of electrification, we cannot undertake any real constructive
    work. When we discuss the restoration of agriculture, industry and
    transport, and their harmonious co-ordination, we are obliged to
    discuss a broad economic plan. We must adopt a definite plan. of
    course, it will be a plan adopted as a first approximation. This
    Party programme will not be as invariable as our real Party
    programme is, which can be modified by Party congresses alone. No,
    day by day this programme will be improved, elaborated, perfected
    and modified, in every workshop and in every volost. We need it as
    a first draft, which will be submitted to the whole of Russia as a
    great economic plan designed for a period of not less than ten
    years and indicating how Russia is to be placed on the real
    economic basis required for communism. What was one of the most
    powerful incentives that multiplied our strength and our energies
    to a tremendous degree when we fought and won on the war front? It
    was the realisation of danger. Everybody asked whether it was
    possible that the landowners and capitalists might return to
    Russia. And the reply was that it was. We therefore multiplied our
    efforts a hundredfold, and we were victorious.</p>

    <p>Take the economic front, and ask whether capitalism can be
    restored economically in Russia. We have combated the Sukharevka
    black market. The other day, just prior to the opening of the
    All-Russia Congress of Soviets, this not very pleasant institution
    was closed down by the Moscow Soviet of Workers&#8217; and Red
    Army Deputies. (<em>Applause.</em>) The Sukharevka black market
    has been closed but it is not that market that is so sinister. The
    old Sukharevka market on Sukharevskaya Square has been closed
    down, an act that presented no difficulty. The sinister thing is
    the &#8220;Sukharevka&#8221; that resides in the heart and
    behaviour of every petty proprietor. This is the
    &#8220;Sukharevka&#8221; that must be closed down. That
    &#8220;Sukharevka&#8221; is the basis of capitalism. While it
    exists, the capitalists may return to Russia and may grow stronger
    than we are. That must be clearly realised. It must serve as the
    mainspring of our work and as a condition and yardstick of our
    real success. While we live in a small-peasant country, there is a
    firmer economic basis for capitalism in Russia than for
    communism. That must be borne in mind. Anyone who has carefully
    observed life in the countryside, as compared with life in the
    cities, knows that we have not torn up the roots of capitalism and
    have not undermined the foundation, the basis, of the internal
    enemy. The latter depends on small-scale production, and there is
    only one way of undermining it, namely, to place the economy of
    the country, including agriculture, on a new technical basis, that
    of modern large-scale production. Only electricity provides that
    basis.</p>

    <p><em>Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the
    whole country.</em> Otherwise the country will remain a
    small-peasant country, and we must clearly realise that. We are
    weaker than capitalism, not only on the world scale, but also
    within the country. That is common knowledge. We have realised it,
    and we shall see to it that the economic basis is transformed from
    a small-peasant basis into a large-scale industrial basis. Only
    when the country has been electrified, and industry, agriculture
    and transport have been placed on the technical basis of modern
    large-scale industry, only then shall we be fully victorious.</p>

    <p>We have already drawn up a preliminary plan for the
    electrification of the country; two hundred of our best scientific
    and technical men have worked on it. We have a plan which gives us
    estimates of materials and finances covering a long period of
    years, not less than a decade. This plan indicates how many
    million barrels of cement and how many million bricks we shall
    require for the purpose of electrification. To accomplish the task
    of electrification from the financial point of view, the estimates
    are between 1,000 and 1,200 million gold rubles. You know that we
    are far from being able to meet this sum from our gold
    reserves. Our stock of foodstuffs is not very large either. We
    must therefore meet the expenditure indicated in these estimates
    by means of concessions, in accordance with the plan I have
    mentioned. You will see the calculation showing how the
    restoration of our industry and our transport is being planned on
    this basis. 

    </p>
    <p> I recently had occasion to attend a peasant festival held in
      Volokolamsk Uyezd, a remote part of Moscow Gubernia, where the
      peasants have electric lighting.<a id="bk08" href="#fw08"
      name="bk08"><sup class="enote">[8]</sup></a> A meeting was
      arranged in the street, and one of the peasants came forward and
      began to make a speech welcoming this new event in the lives of
      the peasants. &#8220;We peasants were unenlightened,&#8221; he
      said, &#8220;and now light has appeared among us, an
      &#8217;unnatural light, which will light up our peasant
      darkness&#8217;.&#8221; For my part, these words did not
      surprise me. Of course, to the non-Party peasant masses electric
      light is an &#8220;unnatural&#8221; light; but what we consider
      unnatural is that the peasants and workers should have lived for
      hundreds and thousands of years in such backwardness, poverty
      and oppression under the yoke of the landowners and the
      capitalists. You cannot emerge from this darkness very
      rapidly. What we must now try is to convert every electric power
      station we build into a stronghold of enlightenment to be used
      to make the masses electricity-conscious, so to speak. All
      should be made aware of the reason why these small electric
      power stations, whose numbers run into the dozens, are linked up
      with the restoration of industry. We have an established plan of
      electrification, but the fulfilment of this plan is designed to
      cover a number of years. We must fulfil this plan at all costs,
      and the period of its fulfilment must be reduced. Here we must
      have the same thing as was the case with one of our first
      economic plans, the plan for the restoration of
      transport&#8212;Order No. 1042&#8212;which was designed to cover
      a period of five years, but has now been reduced to three and a
      half years because we are ahead of the schedule. To carry out
      the electrification plan we may need a period of ten or twenty
      years to effect the changes that will preclude any return to
      capitalism. This will be an example of rapid social development
      without precedent anywhere in the world. The plan must be
      carried out at all costs, and its deadline brought nearer.</p>

    <p>This is the first time that we have set about economic work in
    such a fashion that, besides separate plans which have arisen in
    separate sections of industry as, for instance, in the transport
    system and have been brought into other branches of industry, we
    now have an all-over plan calculated for a number of years. This
    is hard work, designed to bring about the victory of
    communism.</p>

    <p>It should, however, be realised and remembered that we cannot
    carry out electrification with the illiterates we have. Our
    commission will endeavour to stamp out illiteracy&#8212;but that
    is not enough. It has done a good deal compared with the past, but
    it has done little compared with what has to be done. Besides
    literacy, we need cultured, enlightened and educated working
    people; the majority of the peasants must be made fully aware of
    the tasks awaiting us. This programme of the Party must be a basic
    book to be used in every school. You will find in it, in addition
    to the general plan of electrification, separate plans for every
    district of Russia. Thus every comrade who goes to the provinces
    will have a definite scheme of electrification for his district, a
    scheme for transition from darkness and ignorance to a normal
    life. And, comrades, you can and must compare the theses you have
    been presented with, elaborate and check them on the spot; you
    must see to it that when the question &#8220;What is
    communism?&#8221; is asked in any school and in any study circle,
    the answer should contain not only what is written in the Party
    programme but should also say how we can emerge from the state of
    ignorance.</p>

    <p>Our best men, our economic experts, have accomplished the task
    we set them of drawing up a plan for the electrification of Russia
    and the restoration of her economy. We must now see to it that the
    workers and peasants should realise how great and difficult this
    task is, how it must be approached and tackled.</p>

    <p>We must see to it that every factory and every electric power
      station becomes a centre of enlightenment; if Russia is covered
      with a dense network of electric power stations and powerful
      technical installations, our communist economic development will
      become a model for a future socialist Europe and Asia. (<em>Stormy
	and prolonged applause.</em>)

    This agreement, which established friendly relations between the

    despite opposition from British ruling circles. It was based on
    the principles of peaceful coexistence and
    co-operation, equality, respect for the sovereignty of the
    two-countries, non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual
    advantage. All the treaties concluded by tsarist Russia with
    Persia and third parties which infringed on the sovereignty of the
    Persian people were revoked. Persia got back all the concessions
    of the tsarist government on her territory. The Soviet Government
    renounced claims to the loans granted to Persia by the tsarist
    government. Especially important were the articles pledging both
    parties to preclude the formation or the existence on their
    respective territories of organisations or groups with aims
    subversive to Russia or Persia. This was the first equal treaty in

    The All-Russia Bureau for Production Propaganda of the All-Russia
    Central Council of Trade Unions was set up by a decision of the
    C.C. R.C.P.(B.) on December 8, 1920. It consisted of
    representatives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
    (Bolsheviks), the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions, the
    Supreme Council of the National Economy, the Chief Committee for
    Political Education, the Central Board for Vocational Training,

    Presidium of the Supreme Council of the National Economy and the
    People&#8217;s Commissariat of Agriculture to work out a plan for
    the construction of a network of power stations. On February 21,
    1920, the Supreme Council of the National Economy, by agreement
    with the People&#8217;s Commissariat of Agriculture, appointed a
    State Commission for the Electrification of Russia. The Commission
