<h2>Report On Concessions Delivered To The R C.P.(B.) Group At The Eighth Congress Of Soviets December 21</h2> 

<hr />

    <p class="fst">Comrades, I think you have made a fully correct
    decision by preferring the discussion on concessions to be held
    first in the Party group. To the best of our knowledge, the
    question of concessions has everywhere aroused considerable
    concern and even anxiety, not only in Party circles and among the
    working-class masses but also among the masses of the
    peasantry. All comrades have pointed out that, since the decree of
    November 23 of this year, the questions most frequently raised and
    the written questions submitted at most meetings held on a variety
    of subjects have dealt with concessions, and the general tone of
    the questions, as well as of talk on the subject, has been one of
    apprehension: we have driven out our own capitalists, and now we
    want to admit others. I believe that this apprehension, this
    widespread interest in concessions&#8212;displayed, not only by
    Party comrades but by many others&#8212;is a good sign, which
    shows that in three years of incredibly hard struggle the
    workers&#8217; and peasants&#8217; state power has become so
    strong and our experience of the capitalists has become so fixed
    in the mind that the broad masses consider the workers&#8217; and
    peasants&#8217; state power stable enough to manage without
    concessions; they also consider their lesson learnt well enough to
    avoid any deals with the capitalists unless there is a dire
    necessity to do so. This sort of supervision from below, this kind
    of apprehension emanating from the masses, and this kind of
    anxiety among non-Party circles show the highly vigilant attention
    that is being paid to relations between us and the capitalists. I
    believe that on this score we should absolutely welcome this
    apprehension as revealing the temper of the masses.</p>

    <p>Yet I think that we shall come to the conclusion that, in the
    question of concessions, we cannot be guided by this revolutionary
    instinct alone. When we have analysed all aspects of the question
    we shall see that the policy we have adopted&#8212;the policy of
    offering concessions&#8212;is the correct one. I can tell you
    briefly that the main subject of my report&#8212;or rather the
    repetition of a talk I had very recently in Moscow with several
    hundred leading executives,<a id="bk01" href="#fw01"
    name="bk01"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></a> because I have not
    prepared a report and cannot present it to you&#8212;the main
    subject of this talk is to offer proof of two premises: first,
    that any war is merely the continuation of peacetime politics by
    other means, and second, that the concessions which we are giving,
    which we are forced to give, are a continuation of war in another
    form, using other means. To prove these two premises, or rather to
    prove only the second because the first does not require any
    special proof, I shall begin with the political aspect of the
    question. I shall dwell on those relations existing between the
    present-day imperialist powers, which are important for an
    understanding of present-day foreign po!icy in its entirety, and
    of our reasons for adopting this policy.</p>

    <p>The American Vanderlip sent a letter to the Council of
    People&#8217;s Commissars in which he said that the Republicans,
    members of the Republican Party of America, the party of the
    banking interests, which is linked with memories of the war
    against the Southern States for liberation, were not in power at
    the time. He wrote this before the November elections, which he
    hoped the Republicans would win (they have won them) and have
    their own president in March. The Republicans&#8217; policy, he
    went on, would not repeat the follies that had involved America in
    European affairs, they would look after their own
    interests. American interests would lead them to a clash with
    Japan, and they would fight Japan. It might interest you to know,
    he went on, that in 1923 the U.S. navy would be stronger than
    Britain&#8217;s. To fight, they needed control of oil, without
    which they could not wage a modern war. They not only needed oil,
    but also had to take steps to ensure that the enemy did not get
    any. Japan was in a bad way in that respect. Somewhere near
    Kamchatka there is an inlet (whose name he had forgotten) with oil
    deposits, and they did not want the Japanese to get that oil. If
    we sold them that land, Vanderlip could vouch that the Americans
    would grow so enthusiastic that the U.S. would immediately
    recognise our government. If we offered a concession, and did not
    sell them the land, he could not say that they would refuse to
    examine the project, but he could not promise the enthusiasm that
    would guarantee recognition of the Soviet Government.</p>

    <p>Vanderlip&#8217;s letter is quite outspoken; with unparalleled
    cynicism he outlines the point of view of an imperialist who
    clearly sees that a war with Japan is imminent, and poses the
    question openly and directly&#8212;enter into a deal with us and
    you will get certain advantages from it. The issue is the
    following: the Far East, Kamchatka and a piece of Siberia are
    <em>de facto</em> in the possession of Japan insofar as her troops
    are in control there, and circumstances made necessary the
    creation of a buffer state, the Far Eastern Republic. We are well
    aware of the unbelievable sufferings that the Siberian peasants
    are enduring at the hands of the Japanese imperialists and the
    atrocities the Japanese have committed in Siberia. The comrades
    from Siberia know this; their recent publications have given
    details of it.<a id="bk02" href="#fw02" name="bk02"><sup
    class="enote">[2]</sup></a> Nevertheless, we cannot go to war with
    Japan and must make every effort, not only to put off a war with
    Japan but, if possible, to avert it because, for reasons known to
    you, it is beyond our strength. At the same time Japan is causing
    us tremendous losses by depriving us of our links with world trade
    through the Pacific Ocean. Under such conditions, when we are
    confronted with a growing conflict, an imminent clash between
    America and Japan&#8212;for a most stubborn struggle has been
    going on for many decades between Japan and America over the
    Pacific Ocean and the mastery of its shores, and the entire
    diplomatic, economic and trade history of the Pacific Ocean and
    its shores is full of quite definite indications that the struggle
    is developing and making war between America and Japan
    inevitable&#8212;we return to a situation we were in for three
    years: we are a Socialist Republic surrounded by imperialist
    countries that are far stronger than us in the military sense, are
    using every means of agitation and propaganda to increase hatred
    for the Soviet Republic, and will never miss an opportunity for
    military intervention, as they put it, i.e., to strangle Soviet
    power.</p>

    <p>If, remembering this, we cast a glance over the history of the
    past three years from the point of view of the international
    situation of the Soviet Republic, it becomes clear that we have
    been able to hold out and have been able to defeat the Entente
    powers&#8212;an alliance of unparalleled might that was supported
    by our whiteguards&#8212;only because there has been no unity
    among these powers. We have so far been victorious only because of
    the most profound discord among the imperialist powers, and only
    because that discord has not been a fortuitous and internal
    dissension between parties, but a most deep-seated and
    ineradicable conflict of economic interests among the imperialist
    countries which, based on private property in land and capital,
    cannot but pursue a predatory policy which has stultified their
    efforts to unite their forces against the Soviets. I take Japan,
    who controlled almost the whole of Siberia and could, of course,
    have helped Kolchak at any time. The main reason she did not do so
    was that her interests differ radically from those of America, and
    she did not want to pull chestnuts out of the fire for
    U.S. capital. Knowing this weakness, we could of course pursue no
    other policy than that of taking advantage of this enmity between
    America and Japan so as to strengthen ourselves and delay any
    possibility of an agreement between Japan and America against us;
    we have had an instance of the possibility of such an agreement:
    American newspapers carried the text of an agreement between all
    countries who had promised to support Kolchak<a id="bk03"
    href="#fw03" name="bk03"><sup class="enote">[3]</sup></a></p>

    <p>That agreement fell through, of course, but it is not
    impossible that an attempt will be made to restore it at the first
    opportunity. The deeper and more formidable the communist movement
    grows, the greater will be the number of new attempts to strangle
    our Republic. Hence our policy of utilising the discord among the
    imperialist powers so as to hamper an agreement or to make one
    temporarily impossible. This has been the fundamental line of our
    policy for three years; it necessitated the conclusion of the
    Peace of Brest-Litovsk, as well as the signing, with Bullitt, of a
    peace treaty and an armistice agreement most disadvantageous to
    us. This political line of conduct enjoins us to grasp at a
    proposal on the granting of concessions. Today we are giving
    America Kamchatka, which in any case is not actually ours because
    it is held by Japanese troops. At the moment we are in no
    condition to fight Japan. We are giving America, for economic
    exploitation, a territory where we have absolutely no naval or
    military forces, and where we cannot send them. By doing so we are
    setting American imperialism against Japanese imperialism and
    against the bourgeoisie closest to us, the Japanese bourgeoisie,
    which still maintains its hold on the Far Eastern Republic.</p>

    <p>Thus, our main interests were political at the concessions
    negotiations. Recent events, moreover, have shown with the
    greatest clarity that we have been the gainers from the mere fact
    of negotiations on concessions. We have not yet granted any
    concessions, and shall not be able to do so until the American
    president takes office, which will not be before March; besides,
    we reserve the possibility of renouncing the agreement when the
    details are being worked out.</p>

    <p>It follows, therefore, that in this matter the economic
    interest is secondary, its real value lying in its political
    interest. The contents of the press we have received goes to show
    that we have been the gainers. Vanderlip himself insisted that the
    concessions plan should be kept secret for the time being, until
    the Republican Party had won the elections. We agreed not to
    publish either his letter or the entire preliminary
    draft. However, it appeared that such a secret could not be kept
    for long. No sooner had Vanderlip returned to America than
    exposures of various kinds began. Before the elections Harding was
    candidate for the presidency; he has now been elected. The
    selfsame Harding published in the press a denial of the report
    that he was in touch with the Soviets through Vanderlip. That
    denial was categorical, almost in the following words: I
    don&#8217;t know Vanderlip and recognise no relations with the
    Soviets. The reason behind this denial is quite obvious. On the
    eve of the elections in bourgeois America, it might have meant
    losing several hundred thousand votes for Harding to become known
    as a supporter of an agreement with the Soviets, and so he
    hastened to announce in the press that he did not know any
    Vanderlip. As soon as the elections were over, however,
    information of a quite different kind began to come in from
    America. In a number of newspaper articles Vanderlip came out in
    full support of an agreement with the Soviets and even wrote in
    one article that he compared Lenin to Washington. It turns out,
    therefore, that in the bourgeois countries we have propagandists
    for an agreement with us, and have won these propagandists from
    among representatives of exploiters of the worst type, such as
    Vanderlip, and not in the person of the Soviet ambassador or among
    certain journalists.</p>

    <p>When I told a meeting of leading executives what I am now
    telling you, a comrade just back from America where he had worked
    in Vanderlip&#8217;s factories, said he had been horrified;
    nowhere had he seen such exploitation as at Vanderlip&#8217;s
    factories. And now in the person of this capitalist shark we have
    won a propagandist for trade relations with Soviet Russia, and
    even if we do not get anything except the proposed agreement on
    concessions we shall still be able to say that we have gained
    something. We have received a number of reports, secret ones, of
    course, to the effect that the capitalist countries have not given
    up the idea of launching a new war against Soviet Russia in the
    spring. We have learnt that preliminary steps are being taken by
    some capitalist states, while whiteguard elements are, it may be
    said, making preparations in all countries. Our chief interest
    therefore, lies in achieving the re-establishment of trade
    relations, and for that purpose we need to have at least a section
    of the capitalists on our side.</p>

    <p>In Britain the struggle has been going on for a long time. We
    have gained by the mere fact that among those who represent the
    worst capitalist exploitation we have people who back the policy
    of restoring trade relations with Russia. The agreement with
    Britain&#8212;a trade agreement&#8212;has not yet been
    signed. Krasin is now actively negotiating it in London. The
    British Government has submitted its draft to us and we have
    presented our counterdraft, but all the same we see that the
    British Government is dragging out the negotiations and that there
    is a reactionary military group hard at work there which is
    hindering the conclusion of trade agreements and has so far been
    successful. It is our prime interest and prime duty to support
    anything that can strengthen the parties and groups working for
    the conclusion of this agreement with us. In Vanderlip we have
    gained such a supporter, not by mere chance or because Vanderlip
    is particularly enterprising or knows Siberia very well. The
    causes here lie much deeper and are linked with the development of
    the interests of British imperialism, which possesses a huge
    number of colonies. This rift between American and British
    imperialism is deep, and it is our imperative duty to base
    ourselves on it.</p>

    <p>I have mentioned that Vanderlip is particularly knowledgeable
    in respect of Siberia. When our talks were coming to a close,
    Comrade Chicherin pointed out that Vanderlip should be received
    because it would have an excellent effect on his further actions
    in Western Europe. Of course, the prospect of talking to such a
    capitalist shark was not of the pleasantest, but then I had had to
    talk very politely, by way of duty, even to the late Mirbach, so I
    was certainly not afraid of a talk with Vanderlip. It is
    interesting that when Vanderlip and I exchanged all sorts of
    pleasantries and he started joking and telling me that the
    Americans are an extremely practical people and do not believe
    what they are told until they see it with their own eyes, I said
    to him, half in banter: &#8220;Now you can see how good things are
    in Soviet Russia and you can introduce the same in America.&#8221;

    He answered me, not in English but in Russian: &#8220;Mozhet

    byt.&#8221;[* * Perhaps. --<em>Ed.</em>]

      Why, you even know Russian?&#8221; He
    answered: &#8220;A long time ago I travelled five thousand versts
    through Siberia and the country interested me greatly.&#8221; This
    humorous exchange of pleasantries with Vanderlip ended by his
    saying as he was leaving, &#8220;Yes, it is true Mr. Lenin has no
    horns and I must tell that to my friends in America.&#8221; It
    would have seemed simply ridiculous had it not been for the
    further reports in the European press to the effect that the
    Soviets are a monster no relations can be established with. We
    were given an opportunity to throw 
    into that swamp a stone in the person of Vanderlip, who favours
    the re-establishment of trade relations with us.</p>

    <p>There has not been a single report from Japan that has not
    spoken of the extraordinary alarm in Japanese commercial
    circles. The Japanese public say that they will never go against
    their own interests, and are opposed to concessions in Soviet
    Russia. In short, we have a terrific aggravation of the enmity
    between Japan and America and thus an undoubted slackening of both
    Japanese and American pressure on us.</p>

    <p>At the meeting of executives in Moscow where I had to mention
    the fact, the following question was asked. &#8220;It
    appears,&#8221; one of the comrades wrote, &#8220;that we are
    driving Japan and America to war, but it is the workers and
    peasants who will do the fighting. Although these are imperialist
    powers, is it worthy of us socialists to drive two powers into a
    war against each other, which will lead to the shedding of workers
    blood?&#8221; I replied that if we were really driving workers and
    peasants to war that would be a crime. All our politics and
    propaganda, however, are directed towards putting an end to war
    and in no way towards driving nations to war. Experience has shown
    sufficiently that the socialist revolution is the only way out of
    eternal warfare. Our policy, therefore, is not that of involving
    others in a war. We have not done anything justifying, directly or
    indirectly, a war between Japan and America. All our propaganda
    and all our newspaper articles try to drive home the truth that a
    war between America and Japan would be just as much an imperialist
    war as the one between the British and the German groups in 1914,
    and that socialists should think, not of defending their
    respective countries but of overthrowing the power of the
    capitalists; they should think of the workers&#8217;
    revolution. Is it the correct policy for us to use the discord
    between the imperialist bandits to make it more difficult for them
    to unite against us who are doing everything in our power to
    accelerate that revolution, but are in the position of a weak
    socialist republic that is being attacked by imperialist bandits?
    Of course, it is the correct policy. We have pursued that policy
    for four years. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was the chief
    expression of this policy. While the German imperialists were
    offering resistance, we were able to hold out even when the Red
    Army had not yet been formed, by using the contradictions existing
    between the imperialists.</p>

    <p>Such was the situation in which our concessions policy in
    respect to Kamchatka emerged. This type of concession is quite
    exceptional. I shall speak later of the way the other concessions
    are taking shape. For the moment I shall confine myself to the
    political aspect of the question. I want to point out that the
    relations between Japan and America show why it is to our
    advantage to offer concessions or to use them as an
    inducement. Concessions presume some kind of re-establishment of
    peaceful agreements, the restoration of trade relations; they
    presume the possibility for us to begin direct and extensive
    purchases of the machinery we need. We must turn all our efforts
    to achieving this. That has not yet been done.</p>

    <p>The comrade who has asked about the resumption of trade
    relations with Britain wants to know why the signing of the
    agreement with that country has been held up. My answer is that it
    is being delayed because the British Government is hesitant. Most
    of the trade and industrial bourgeoisie in Britain are in favour
    of relations being resumed and clearly realise that any action for
    war means taking enormous risks and speeding up the
    revolution. You will remember that during our drive on Warsaw the
    British Government presented us with an ultimatum, threatening to
    order its navy to sail against Petrograd. You will remember that
    Councils of Action sprang up all over Britain at the time and the
    Menshevik leaders of the British working class declared that they
    were against war and would not permit one. On the other hand, the
    reactionary section of the British bourgeoisie and the military
    clique at court are in favour of the war continuing. The delay in
    signing the trade agreement must undoubtedly be ascribed to their
    influence. I shall not go into all the details of these trade
    relations with Britain, or of this agreement on trade relations
    with Britain, because it would take me too far afield. This
    delicate problem had recently to be very thoroughly discussed by
    the Central Committee of the Party. We have returned to it again
    and again, and our policy in this matter has been marked by the
    greatest degree of accommodation. Our aim now is to obtain a trade
    agreement with Britain so as to start more regular trade and be
    able to buy as soon as possible the machinery necessary for our
    extensive plan to rehabilitate the national economy. The sooner we
    do this the greater will be the basis ensuring our economic
    independence of the capitalist countries. At present, after having
    burnt their fingers in the armed invasion of Russia, they cannot
    think of an immediate resumption of the war. We must seize the
    opportunity and bend every effort to achieve trade relations even
    at the cost of maximum concessions, for we cannot for a moment
    believe in lasting trade relations with the imperialist powers;
    the respite will be temporary. The experience of the history of
    revolutions and great conflicts teaches us that wars, a series of
    wars, are inevitable. The existence of a Soviet Republic alongside
    of capitalist countries&#8212;a Soviet Republic surrounded by
    capitalist countries&#8212;is so intolerable to the capitalists
    that they will seize any opportunity to resume the war. The
    peoples are weary of the imperialist war and threaten to make
    their indignation felt if war continues, but the possibility of
    the capitalists being able to resume it in a few years is not
    precluded. That is why we must exert every effort to utilise the
    opportunity, since it exists, and conclude trade agreements. I can
    say the following here (this is not for the record) I think that
    we shall ultimately emerge on top as a result of our firm stand
    that the Communist International is not a governmental
    institution. That is the more probable for the British bourgeoisie
    having to realise the ridiculousness of rising up against the
    Third International. The Third International was formed in March
    1919. Its Second Congress was held in July 1920, following which
    the terms proposed in Moscow were made publicly known in all
    countries. An open struggle is going on for adhesion to the
    Communist International. The organisational foundations for the
    formation of Communist parties exist everywhere. In these
    circumstances, any attempt to present us seriously with an
    ultimatum that we get rid of the Communist International is
    inexcusable. However, the emphasis laid on the matter shows where
    the shoe pinches and what displeases them in our policy. Even
    without that, we have known what it is in our policy that is not
    to their liking. The East is another question that can be spoken
    of at a Party meeting, and is alarming Britain. The latter wants
    us to give assurances that we will do nothing against
    Britain&#8217;s interests in the East. We are willing and ready to
    give such an undertaking. As an example I might mention that the
    Congress of Peoples of the East, a Communist congress, took place,
    not in the R.S.F.S.R. but in Baku, in the independent republic of
    Azerbaijan. The British Government will have no reason to accuse
    us of doing anything against British interests. In their ignorance
    of our Constitution, they sometimes confuse the Azerbaijan
    Republic with the Russian Soviet Republic. Our laws are definite
    and precise on that score, and it will be easy to refute the false
    interpretations of the British ministers. However, there are still
    differences on this subject, and Krasin is engaged with the
    ministers in talks on these two sore points.</p>

    <p>In July, when Poland was threatened with utter defeat, and the
    Red Army was about to crush her, the complete text of an agreement
    was presented by Britain, which in effect said that we had to
    declare as a matter of principle that we would not carry on
    official propaganda or do any thing contrary to British interests
    in the East. That was to be laid down at a subsequent political
    conference, but at the moment they were concluding a definite
    trade agreement. They asked whether we would like to sign it. We
    replied that we would. Today we say again that we will sign such
    an agreement. The political conference will specify
    Britain&#8217;s interests in the East. We also have certain
    interests in the East, and we shall set them forth in detail when
    the need arises. Britain cannot say outright that she is
    abandoning her July proposal and so she is dragging things out and
    concealing from her own people the truth about the
    negotiations. The outcome of the negotiations is uncertain and we
    cannot guarantee that an agreement will be signed. The very
    powerful court and military circles in Britain are opposed to the
    agreement. We are, however, proposing maximum concessions, and we
    believe it to be in our interests to sign a trade pact and
    purchase with all possible dispatch some of the essentials for the
    restoration of the railways (i.e., locomotives), for the
    rehabilitation of industry, and for electrification. This is more
    important to us than anything else. If we achieve that, we shall
    become so strong a few years that even, if the worst comes to the
    worst and there is armed intervention in a few years&#8217; time,
    it will fail because we shall be stronger than we are now. The
    line we in the Central Committee are following is one of maximum
    concessions to Britain. If these gentlemen think they will catch
    us breaking promises, we declare that our government will not
    carry on any official propaganda and that we have no intention of
    infringing on any of Britain&#8217;s interests in the East. If
    they hope to derive some advantage from this, let them try; we
    shall not be the losers.</p>

    <p>I now come to the question of the relations between Britain and
    France. These are confused. On the one hand, Britain and France
    belong to the League of Nations and are obliged to act jointly; on
    the other hand, whenever any tension arises they fail to do
    so. When Comrade Kamenev was in London conducting negotiations
    together with Krasin, this became quite obvious. France was in
    favour of supporting Poland and Wrangel, but the British
    Government declared it would not support France. Concessions are
    more acceptable to Britain than to France, which still aspires to
    get her debts paid back, while in Britain capitalists with any
    business sense no longer think about it. From that angle, too, it
    is to our advantage to use the dissension between Britain and
    France, and we must therefore insist on the political proposal of
    concessions to Britain. We now have a draft agreement on timber
    concessions in the Far North. Since there is no political unity
    between Britain and France, our position imposes on us the duty of
    even incurring a certain risk, if only we succeed in hampering a
    military alliance between Britain and France against us. A new war
    that Britain and France will support against us will be an immense
    burden on us (even if it ends as the war with Wrangel has done, in
    our complete victory), it will hinder our economic development and
    worsen the condition of the workers and peasants. We must
    therefore be ready to do whatever involves the least
    loss. Obviously, the losses from concessions are negligible
    compared with those that would arise from a delay in our economic
    development and the loss of thousands of workers and peasants that
    would ensue were we unable to withstand the allianceof the
    imperialists. Negotiations on concessions with Britain are one of
    the means of standing up to their alliance. That is the political
    aspect of the issue.</p>

    <p>Last, the final aspect of the matter is the attitude of Britain
    and the entire Entente to Germany. If we exclude America, Germany
    is the most advanced country. In the development of electricity
    her technical level is even higher than America&#8217;s. The
    conditions obtaining in Germany in consequence of the Treaty of
    Versailles make her existence impossible. Because of that
    situation it is natural for Germany to be prompted towards an
    alliance with Russia. When the Russian troops were approaching
    Warsaw, all Germany was seething. An alliance between Russia and
    Germany, a country that has been strangled, a country that is able
    to set gigantic productive forces in motion&#8212;this situation
    has led to a political mix up in Germany: the German Black
    Hundreds sympathise with the Russian Bolsheviks in the same way as
    the Spartacus League does. This can well be understood because it
    derives from economic causes, and is the basis of the entire
    economic situation and of our foreign policy.</p>

    <p>While we stand alone and the capitalist world is strong, our
    foreign policy consists, on the one hand, in our having to utilise
    disagreements (to vanquish all the imperialist powers would, of
    course, be a most pleasant thing, but for a fairly long time we
    shall not be in a position to do so). On the one hand, our
    existence depends on the presence of radical differences between
    the imperialist powers, and, on the other, on the Entente&#8217;s
    victory and the Peace of Versailles having thrown the vast
    majority of the German nation into a situation it is impossible
    for them to live in. The Peace of Versailles has created a
    situation in which Germany cannot even dream of a breathing-space,
    or of not being plundered, of not having the means of subsistence
    taken away from her, of her people not being doomed to starvation
    and extinction; Germany cannot even dream of any of these things,
    so that, naturally, her only means of salvation lies in an
    alliance with Soviet Russia, a country towards which her eyes are
    therefore turning. They are furiously opposing Soviet Russia; they
    detest the Bolsheviks, and shoot down their own Communists in the
    manner of real whiteguards. The German bourgeois government has an
    implacable hatred of the Bolsheviks, but such is its international
    position that, against its own desires, the government is driven
    towards peace with Soviet Russia. That, comrades, is the second
    corner-stone of our international policy, our foreign policy; it
    is to show peoples that are conscious of the bourgeois yoke that
    there is no salvation for them without the Soviet Republic. Since
    the Soviet Republic withstood the onslaught of the imperialists
    for three years, this goes to show that one country, and that
    country alone, has been successful in hurling back this
    imperialist yoke. That country has been called a country of
    &#8220;robbers", &#8220;plunderers", &#8220;bandits", Bolsheviks,
    etc.&#8212;let that be so, but still it is impossible to improve
    the economic situation without that country.</p>

    <p>In a situation such as this, the question of concessions
    acquires still another aspect. The pamphlet I have in my hands is
    the Decree on Concessions of November 23. It will be distributed
    to all members of the Congress. We intend to publish this pamphlet
    abroad, in several languages.<a id="bk04" href="#fw04"
    name="bk04"><sup class="enote">[4]</sup></a> It is our immediate
    object to do everything possible to arouse interest in concessions
    among the population of the greatest number of countries, to
    interest those countries that are the most oppressed. The
    divergence of interests between Japan and America is very
    great. They are unable to agree between themselves over China, a
    number of islands, etc. The divergence of interests between
    Germany and the Entente is of another kind. Germany&#8217;s
    existence has been made impossible by the conditions in which the
    Entente has placed her. People are dying there because the Entente
    has been requisitioning their motors and their cattle. Such a
    situation urges Germany towards a <em>rapprochement</em> with
    Soviet Russia. I do not know the details of the treaty between
    Germany and the Entente, but in any case the treaty is known to
    ban direct trade relations between Germany and Soviet Russia. When
    we arranged for the purchase of German locomotives, that was done
    through the agency of Sweden. Germany will hardly be able to
    restore direct trade relations with us before April 1921. However,
    progress in restoring our trade relations with Germany is more
    rapid than with the Entente. The conditions of existence in
    Germany are compelling the German people as a whole, including the
    Black Hundreds and the capitalists, to seek relations with Soviet
    Russia. Germany is already linked with us by certain trade
    relations. These links can become closer inasmuch as we are
    offering Germany agricultural concessions. It is therefore clear
    that we must advance concessions as an economic method, even
    irrespective of the measure in which we are able to put the
    project into effect. The interest in concessions is so obvious
    that even if we do not succeed in granting a single concession, or
    none of our agreements are put into effect (and even that is quite
    possible)&#8212;even in that case we shall still have gained
    something, and we still have to pursue our policy because by so
    doing we make it more difficult for the imperialist countries to
    attack us.</p>

    <p>Irrespective of this, we must tell all the oppressed peoples
    that a handful of countries are overtly or covertly, consciously
    or unconsciously, strangling other peoples&#8212;this derives from
    the Treaty of Versailles&#8212;and these peoples are turning to us
    for help, and are becoming more and more aware of the economic
    necessity of an alliance with Soviet Russia against international
    imperialism. Agricultural concessions, therefore, are of a wider
    scope than the old bourgeois concessions; they are different from
    the old capitalist concessions. They remain capitalist in
    character inasmuch as we tell the German capitalists to bring so
    many tractors into our country, in exchange for which we shall
    give them so much excellent virgin land and grain. We are
    attracting capital with the prospect of tremendous profits. In
    this respect the concessions are a purely capitalist undertaking,
    but they acquire an immeasurably greater significance because
    Germany as a nation, Austria and other countries cannot exist
    because they need aid in food and because the entire people,
    irrespective of whether the capitalists make a profit of a hundred
    or two hundred per cent, can, despite anti-Bolshevik prejudices,
    see that the Bolsheviks are establishing completely different
    international relations which make it possible for all oppressed
    peoples to rid themselves of the imperialist yoke. That is why our
    successes of the last three years will lead to still greater
    successes in foreign policy during the coming year. Our policy is
    grouping around the Soviet Republic those capitalist countries
    which are being strangled by imperialism. That is why our
    concessions proposal has more than a capitalist significance; that
    is why it is a hand held out, not only to the German capitalists
    with the offer, &#8220;Bring us hundreds of tractors and make as
    much as three hundred per cent on each ruble if you like"; it is a
    hand held out to oppressed peoples, an alliance of the oppressed
    masses, which is a factor in the future proletarian
    revolution. The doubts and fears that still exist in the advanced
    countries, which assert that Russia could risk a socialist
    revolution because she is a vast country with her own means of
    subsistence while they, the industrial countries of Europe, cannot
    do so because they have no allies&#8212;these doubts and fears are
    groundless. We say: &#8220;You now have an ally, Soviet
    Russia.&#8221; Since we are granting concessions, this will be an
    alliance that will consolidate the alliance against world
    imperialism. This is a postulate that must not be lost sight of,
    it justifies our concessions policy and proves the need to grant
    concessions.</p>

    <p>And now for several purely economic considerations. I shall now
    go on to these considerations and read out the stipulations of the
    law, although I hope that the comrades present here have read the
    law of November 23. I shall, however, remind you briefly that it
    says that concessionaires shall be paid with part of the products,
    that when special technical improvements have been introduced, we
    are prepared to offer trade advantages, and that the term of
    concessions will be more or less prolonged, depending on the
    volume and character of the expenditures involved. We guarantee
    that property invested in an enterprise shall not be confiscated
    or requisitioned.</p>

    <p>Without such a guarantee owners of private capital and private
    property will not, of course, enter into relations with us. The
    question of courts, which was at first raised in the draft
    agreement, was subsequently removed, since we saw that this was
    not to our advantage. Thus the judicial authority on our territory
    remains in our hands. In the event of a dispute, the issue will be
    settled by our judges. This will be not requisitioning but the
    lawful exercise of jurisprudence by our judicial bodies.</p>

    <p>The fifth clause in the agreement deals with the code of labour
    laws. In the original draft of the agreement, which was discussed
    with Vanderlip, provision was made for the withdrawal of the
    application of the labour code in localities inhabited by
    underdeveloped tribes, we cannot say which. In such places no code
    of labour laws is possible. The labour code was to be replaced in
    such areas by a special agreement on guarantees for the
    workers.</p>

    <p>In the final clause we guarantee the concessionaire against any
    unilateral changes. Without this guarantee, there can, of course,
    be no question of granting concessions. The question of what is
    meant by non-unilateral changes has, however, been left open. That
    will depend on the text of the agreement on each individual
    concession. Arbitration may be possible through some of the
    neutral powers. This is a point that may lead to differences, and
    leaves a certain latitude in determining the actual terms of a
    concession. It should, incidentally, be pointed out that in the
    capitalist countries the Menshevik leaders of the working class
    are considered reliable people. They enter bourgeois governments,
    and it is very difficult for bourgeois governments to challenge
    such mediators or arbitrators as the Mensheviks or social-traitors
    of the European countries. Experience has shown, however, that
    when any serious tension arises, the American and European
    Mensheviks behave just like the Russian Mensheviks do, i.e., they
    do not know how to behave, and are obliged to yield to the
    pressure of the revolutionary masses, though they themselves
    remain opposed to the revolution. The question remains open; we
    shall not decide it in advance.</p>

    <p>From the terms that I have read out to you, you will see that
    economic relations between the capitalist concessionaires and the
    Socialist Republic are far from stable or durable. It is obvious
    that a capitalist who retains private property and exploitation
    relations cannot be anything but a foreign body in a socialist
    republic. Hence one of the main themes in my report: concessions
    are a continuation of war by other means. I shall deal with that
    in detail in a moment, but first I want to mention the three main
    forms or kinds of the concessions.</p>

    <p>In this pamphlet we have given a list of the chief concessions;
    the comrades from the Supreme Council of the National Economy who
    provided the material for the pamphlet and edited it, have
    appended maps showing these objects. These maps show that the
    concessions fall into three main groups&#8212;first, timber
    concessions in the Far North, second, agricultural concessions and
    third, mining concessions in Siberia.</p>

    <p>Our economic interest in timber concessions in the Far North of
    European Russia is obvious; there are tens and even hundreds of
    millions of dessiatines of forest land which we are quite unable
    to exploit because we lack the railways, the means of production
    and the possibility of providing the workers there with food, but
    which could be exploited by a country that owns a big merchant
    fleet and could fell and saw timber properly and export it in
    tremendous quantities.</p>

    <p>If we want to trade with foreign countries&#8212;and we do want
    to, because we realise its necessity&#8212;our chief interest is
    in obtaining as quickly as possible, from the capitalist
    countries, the means of production (locomotives, machinery, and
    electrical equipment) without which we cannot more or less
    seriously rehabilitate our industry, or perhaps may even be unable
    to do so at all, because the machinery needed by our factories
    cannot be made available. It is with the motive of extra profit
    that we must attract the capitalist. He will get surplus
    profit&#8212;well, let him have that surplus profit; we shall
    obtain the fundamentals that will help strengthen us; we shall
    stand firmly on our own feet, and shall win in the economic
    field. We shall have to pay up if we want to get the best
    machinery, etc. What are we to pay with? We still dispose of gold
    reserves totalling several millions. You will see from the special
    plan for the electrification of Russia, drawn up for several
    decades, that this plan, together with the additional work for the
    rehabilitation of industry, will involve an approximate
    expenditure of something like 17,000 million gold
    rubles. Electrification alone will require the direct expenditure
    of more than 1,000 million rubles in gold. We cannot cover this
    with our gold reserves; it is extremely undesirable and dangerous
    for us to export foodstuffs because we have not got sufficient for
    our own industry, and yet this need has to be met. In this case
    there is no concession project economically more suitable for us
    than the forests of the Far North which cover an enormous area,
    and where the timber is rotting away and a total loss because we
    are economically unable to exploit these timber reserves. Timber,
    however, is of tremendous value on the world market. Besides, the
    Far North is also convenient politically because it is an outlying
    border area. This concession is convenient to us both politically
    and economically, and we must make the best possible use of it. At
    the Moscow Conference I have told you about,<a id="bk05"
    href="#fw05" name="bk05"><sup class="enote">[5]</sup></a> Milyutin
    said that negotiations with Britain about concessions in the north
    of European Russia are progressing. There are several scores of
    millions of dessiatines of standing timber there. If we grant
    three or five million dessiatines disposed chequerwise, we shall
    get an opportunity to derive advantage from up-to-date
    enterprises, an opportunity to learn, by stipulating that our
    technicians take part in the work; we shall thus gain a lot and
    make it difficult for capitalist powers that enter into deals with
    us to take part in military action against us, because war cancels
    everything, and should one break out we shall get possession of
    all the buildings, installations and railways. Any possible action
    against us by new Kolchaks, Denikins and others will not be made
    the easier.</p>

    <p>The second type is agricultural concessions. With the exception
    of West Siberia with its vast expanses of excellent land,
    inaccessible to us because of its great distance from railways,
    there are in European Russia and along the River Ural alone (our
    Commissariat of Agriculture has taken the necessary steps and has
    calculated the amount of land we cannot cultivate, which is no
    less than 3,000,000 dessiatines along the River Ural, abandoned by
    entire Cossack villages as a result of the victorious culmination
    of the Civil War) excellent lands that must be brought under the
    plough, but which we cannot cultivate because of the shortage of
    draught animals and our weakened productive forces.</p>

    <p>The state farms of the Don Region have about 800,000
    dessiatines which we cannot cultivate; to cultivate this land we
    shall need a tremendous number of draught animals or entire
    tractor columns that we cannot put on the fields, while some
    capitalist countries, including those that urgently need
    foodstuffs&#8212;Austria, Germany and Bohemia&#8212;could put
    tractors to work and obtain excellent wheat in good season. We do
    not know to what extent we shall be able to carry that out. At
    present we have two tractor plants&#8217; functioning, in Moscow
    and Petrograd, but in consequence of the difficult conditions that
    obtain they cannot produce tractors in large numbers. We could
    ease the situation by purchasing a greater number of
    tractors. Tractors are the most important means of effecting a
    radical change in the old farming methods and of extending the
    area cultivated. By such concessions we shall show a large number
    of countries that we are able to develop the world economy on a
    gigantic scale.</p>

    <p>If our propaganda and our proposal do not meet with success,
    and if our proposal is not accepted, we shall still reap an
    advantage that is not only political but socialist as well. What
    is going on in the capitalist world is not only a waste of wealth,
    but madness and a crime, for in some countries there is a food
    surplus that cannot be sold because of currency revolutions, since
    money has depreciated in a number of countries that have suffered
    defeat. Huge stocks of foodstuffs are rotting away, while tens of
    millions of people in countries like Germany are actually
    starving. This absurdity, this crime of capitalism, is becoming
    obvious to all capitalist countries and to the small countries
    that surround Russia. To the capitalist countries the Soviet
    Republic says: &#8220;We have hundreds of thousands of dessiatines
    of excellent land that can be ploughed with tractors; you have the
    tractors, the petrol and the trained technicians; we propose to
    all peoples, including the peoples of the capitalist countries, to
    make the rehabilitation of the economy and the salvation of all
    peoples from hunger their main object.&#8221; If the capitalists
    do not understand this, it is an argument demonstrating the
    corruption, madness and criminal nature of the capitalist
    system. That will be of more than mere propaganda value: it will
    be a communist call for revolution, for it shows beyond doubt that
    capitalism is falling apart and cannot satisfy the people&#8217;s
    needs, a fact that is more and more penetrating into the
    consciousness of all peoples. An insignificant minority of
    imperialist countries are growing rich, while a large number of
    other countries are actually on the verge of ruin. The world
    economy needs reorganisation, and the Soviet Republic comes
    forward with a plan of reconstruction, with the following
    incontestable business-like, and realisable proposal: &#8220;You
    are starving under capitalism, despite the fabulous wealth of
    machinery. We can solve the crisis by bringing together your
    machinery and our raw materials, but the capitalists are in the
    way. We have proposed to them that they should accept our offer,
    but they are holding back and wrecking our plan.&#8221; That is
    the second type of concession, the agricultural or tractor
    type.</p>

    <p>Mining concessions are the third type. These are indicated on
    the map of Siberia, with details of each area in which concessions
    are being considered. Siberia&#8217;s mineral wealth is literally
    boundless, and at best, even given significant progress, we cannot
    exploit even a hundredth part of it for many years. The minerals
    are to be found in conditions that demand the best
    machinery. There are such products as copper ore, which the
    capitalists need badly for their electrical industry because it is
    in such short supply. It is possible to rehabilitate the world
    economy and improve the world&#8217;s technology if they enter
    into regular relations with us.</p>

    <p>It is, of course, more difficult to implement these
    concessions, i.e., they present greater difficulties than timber
    or agricultural concessions do. As far as agricultural concessions
    are concerned, it is only a matter of a brief working period with
    tractors being used. Timber concessions are also easier,
    especially as they concern an area we cannot avail ourselves of;
    but mining concessions are frequently at no great distance from
    the railways, frequently in densely populated areas. Here the
    danger is serious and we shall weigh the pros and cons very
    carefully to see whether or not they should be granted; we shall
    do so on definite terms, for there is no doubt that concessions
    are a new kind of war. The capitalists are coming to us to wage a
    new kind of war&#8212;the very existence of the capitalists is in
    itself a war against the socialist world surrounding
    them. Capitalist enterprises in a socialist state are in the
    economic sense a war for freedom of trade, against the policy of
    compulsory deliveries, a war for private property against a
    republic that has abolished that property. On this economic basis
    there develop a variety of relationships (similar to the hostility
    between the Sukharevka Market<a id="bk06" href="#fw06"
    name="bk06"><sup class="enote">[6]</sup></a> and our
    institutions). We may be told that we are closing down the
    Sukharevka black market but opening up a number of other
    &#8220;Sukharevkas&#8221; by letting the capitalists in. We have
    not closed our eyes to this, and say: if we have been victorious
    till now, if we were victorious when our enemies used every means
    to disrupt our enterprises, when there was disruption from within
    combined with that from without, then we must surely be able to
    deal with such things, to keep an eye on them when they are in
    certain limited areas and there are definite conditions and
    relations. We have practical experience of the struggle against
    military espionage and against capitalist sabotage. We fought
    against them when they were under cover in our own institutions;
    surely we shall be able to handle them when the capitalists have
    been let in according to a definite list and under definite
    conditions. We know, of course, that they will try to break these
    conditions, and we shall combat such infractions. But, comrades,
    concessions on a capitalist foundation means war. Until we have
    overthrown capital in other countries, and while capital is much
    stronger than we are, its forces can be sent against us at any
    time and it can start another war against us. For this reason we
    have to make ourselves stronger, and to do that we must develop
    large-scale industry and get our transport going. In carrying this
    out, we are taking a risk; here we again have relations of
    warfare, of struggle, and if they try to undermine our policy, we
    shall fight them. It would be grossly mistaken to think that a
    peaceful agreement on concessions is a peaceful agreement with
    capitalists. It is an agreement concerning war, but an agreement
    that is less dangerous to us, besides being less burdensome for
    the workers and peasants, less burdensome than at the time when
    the best tanks and guns were being thrown into action against us;
    we must therefore use all methods, and, at the cost of economic
    concessions, develop our economic forces and facilitate our
    economic rehabilitation. The capitalists will, of course, not
    honour their agreements, say comrades who are afraid of
    concessions. It is quite impossible, of course, to be sure that
    the capitalists will honour agreements. It will be a war, and war
    is the ultimate argument, which in general remains an argument
    entering the relations of the socialist republic.</p>

    <p>War threatens us at any hour. We are conducting peace
    negotiations with Poland, and there is every chance that peace
    will be concluded, or at least, to be more exact, the vast
    majority of chances are that peace will be concluded. There is no
    doubt, however, that the Savinkovs and the French capitalists are
    working to prevent the treaty from being signed. To the
    capitalists war is possible tomorrow if not today, and they would
    willingly start a war today if they had not learnt something from
    three years&#8217; experience. Concessions constitute a certain
    risk; they are a loss; they are the continuation of war. There is
    no doubt of this, but it is a war that is more to our
    advantage. When we have obtained a certain minimum of the means of
    production, locomotives and machines, then we shall be different,
    in the economic sense, from what we have been till now, and the
    imperialist countries will be still less dangerous to us.</p>

    <p>We have been told that the concessionaires will create
    exclusive conditions for their workers, and supply them with
    better clothes, better footwear, and better food. That will be
    their propaganda among our workers, who are suffering privation
    and will have to suffer privation for a long time to come. We
    shall then have a socialist republic in which the workers are
    poverty-stricken and next to it a capitalist island, in which the
    workers get an excellent livelihood. This apprehension is
    frequently voiced at our Party meetings. Of course, there is a
    danger of that kind, and it shows that concessions are a
    continuation of war and do not constitute peace. We have, however,
    experienced far greater deprivations and have seen that workers
    from capitalist countries nevertheless come to our country,
    knowing that the economic conditions awaiting them in Russia are
    far worse; surely, then, we ought to be able to defend ourselves
    against such propaganda with counter-propaganda; surely we should
    be able to show the workers that capitalism can, of course,
    provide better conditions for certain groups of its workers, but
    that this does not improve the conditions of the rest of the
    workers. And lastly, why is it that at every contact with
    bourgeois Europe and America we, not they, have always won? Why is
    it that to this day it is they who fear to send delegations to us,
    and not we to them? To this day we have always managed to win over
    to our side at least a small part of the delegations, despite the
    fact that such delegations consisted in the main of Menshevik
    elements, and that they were people who came to us for short
    periods. Should we be afraid of being unable to explain the truth
    to the workers?! We should be in a bad way if we had such fears,
    if we were to place such considerations above the direct interest
    which is a matter of the greatest significance as far as
    concessions are concerned. The position of our peasants and
    workers remains a difficult one. It must be improved. We cannot
    have any doubt on that score. I think we shall agree that the
    concessions policy is a policy of continuation of the war, but we
    must also agree that it is our task to ensure the continued
    existence of an isolated socialist republic surrounded by
    capitalist enemies, to preserve a republic that is infinitely
    weaker than the capitalist enemies surrounding it, thereby
    eliminating any possibility of our enemies forming an alliance
    among themselves for the struggle against us, and to hamper their
    policies and not give them an opportunity to win a victory. It is
    our task to secure for Russia the necessary machinery and funds
    for the restoration of the economy; when we have obtained that, we
    shall stand so firmly on our own feet that no capitalist enemies
    can overawe us. That is the point of view which has guided us in
    our policy on concessions, the policy I have outlined.</p>

    On May 26, 1919, the Supreme Council sent a Note to Kolchak over
    the signatures of Wilson, Lloyd George, Clemenceau, Orlando and
    Saionji informing him of the Allies&#8217; readiness to recognise
    Kolchak and supply him with food and munitions to enable him to
    become ruler of all Russia. In return Kolchak was to convene a
    constituent assembly after he took Moscow, recognise the
    independence of Poland and Finland and, unless agreement could be
    reached on the relations between Russia, on the one hand, and
    Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Caucasian and Trans-Caspian
    territories, on the other, to submit this question to the League
    of Nations and to recognise their autonomy pending a decision by
    the League, etc. In his reply Kolchak accepted a number of
    conditions. On July 12 Britain, France, the U.S.A. and Italy
    considering Kolchak&#8217;s reply satisfactory, reaffirmed their
    readiness to give him help.</p>

    &#8220;Sukharevka&#8221; was the name of a market-place near the
    Sukharev Tower built under Peter I in 1692. At the time of the
    foreign military intervention and the Civil War it became a centre
    and symbol of black marketeering. In December 1920 the Moscow
    Soviet decided to close the market. When the New Economic Policy
    was introduced, the market reappeared and existed till 1932. In
    1934 the Sukharev Tower was demolished as a hindrance to
    traffic.</p>
