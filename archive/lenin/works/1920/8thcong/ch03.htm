<h3>Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets</h3>
<h1>Part III</h1>
 <h2>Reply To The Debate On The Report On The Work Of The Council Of People&#8217;s Commissars December 23</h2>

    <hr />

    <p class="fst">(<em>Applause.</em>) Comrades, I must confine
    myself to a few remarks on the speeches and declarations you have
    just heard. One of the notes I have received expresses perplexity
    and asks what is the use of the Congress of Soviets hearing such
    declarations and speeches. I think most of you will disagree with
    this opinion. It is no doubt always very useful to have a reminder
    of what some catchwords, now perhaps quite popular&#8212;as set
    forth by certain parties, sections of which have just made their
    declarations&#8212;may lead to in the present political
    situation. Take for example the reasoning of the representative of
    the Menshevik Party, or to be more exact, a certain section of
    that party. It is not our fault that the Menshevik Party and the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, which still preserve their old titles,
    constitute a conglomeration of heterogeneous parts that are
    constantly changing camps, which turns them into voluntary or
    involuntary, conscious or unconscious, accomplices of
    international imperialism. This is evident from their declarations
    and speeches at this Congress.</p>

    <p>For example, I have been reproached for advancing a new theory
    about an impending new period of wars. I need not go far back into
    history to show what my statements were based upon. We have only
    just finished with Wrangel; but Wrangel&#8217;s troops exist
    somewhere, not very far from the frontiers of our Republic, and
    are biding their time. Therefore, whoever forgets about the danger
    that is constantly threatening us and will never cease as long as
    world imperialism exists, whoever forgets about this forgets about
    our working people&#8217;s republic. To say to us that we are
    conducting secret diplomacy; to say that we must wage only a war
    of defence, at a time when the sword still hangs over us, when to
    this day, despite the hundreds of offers we have made and the
    incredible concessions we are prepared to make, not a single big
    power has concluded peace with us&#8212;to say such things means
    repeating the old phrases of petty-bourgeois pacifism which have
    long become meaningless. If, in the face of these ever actively
    hostile forces, we pledged ourselves&#8212;as we have been advised
    to do&#8212;never to resort to certain actions which from a
    military-strategical point of view may prove to be aggressive, we
    would be, not only fools but criminals. This is whet these
    pacifist phrases and resolutions lead to. They lead to a situation
    wherein the Soviets, surrounded by enemies, will be tied hand and
    foot and thrown to the predators of world imperialism to be torn
    to pieces.</p>

    <p>When, further, we hear talk about the unity of the proletariat
    and about our disrupting that unity, it is hard not to smile. We
    in this country have heard about the unity of the proletariat and
    now see in fact that the unity of the proletariat in the epoch of
    social revolution can be achieved only by the extreme
    revolutionary party of Marxism, and only through a relentless
    struggle against all other parties. (<em>Stormy
    applause.</em>)</p>

    <p>Further, we are told about the arming of the whole people; we
    hear the ABC of the old bourgeois-democratic slogan repeated at a
    time when a most decisive class struggle is raging among the
    people.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I had the pleasure of being
    present&#8212;regrettably, for only a short while&#8212;at a small
    private conference of non-Party peasant delegates to our Congress
    and I learned a great deal from their discussion of some of the
    most burning questions of rural life, the questions of food
    supplies, of their destitution and want, of which you all know.<a
    id="bk01" href="#fw01" name="bk01"><sup
    class="enote">[1]</sup></a> The most striking impression that I
    obtained from this discussion was the depth of the struggle
    between the poor peasants&#8212;the real toilers&#8212;and the
    kulaks and idlers. The supreme significance of our revolution lies
    in our having helped the lowest sections in the rural districts,
    the mass of politically the least educated, the mass of the
    non-Party peasantry, to raise this fundamental question of the
    social revolution, not only from the theoretical but also from the
    broad and practical point of view. In all the villages and hamlets
    throughout our boundless Soviet Russia, people are discussing and
    finding out who benefits from our political and economic
    measures. Every where, even in the most remote villages, people
    understand the problem of the working peasantry and the
    kulaks. Sometimes they accuse each other too heatedly and
    passionately, but at any rate they look into the matter and
    realise that it is necessary, imperatively necessary, to help the
    working peasant and put him on his feet and to repulse all sorties
    by the insolent kulaks.</p>

    <p>The class struggle has become a reality in the rural districts,
    deep down among the masses of the peasantry; we have been doing
    all we can to make this struggle a conscious one. And when, after
    all this, the leaders of a certain special
    &#8220;International&#8221; come before us and talk about arming
    the people, one feels as if one has been transformed into a pupil
    of a preparatory class on questions of Marxism and socialism. To
    forget about the class struggle which is raging all over the world
    means involuntarily aiding the imperialists of the whole world
    against the fighting proletariat. The arming of the people is the
    slogan of our enemies; we stand on the basis of an armed class; we
    have achieved victory on this basis, and on it we will always
    win. (<em>Stormy applause.</em>)</p>

    <p>The representatives of the Mensheviks and the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries asked how we could think of such a thing
    as granting concessions without a special referendum, and why we
    did not make labour equality the corner-stone of our economic
    policy (in the Socialist-Revolutionaries&#8217; resolution this
    labour equality was called &#8220;rule of labour", while in the
    Mensheviks&#8217; resolution it was paraphrased and called
    equality between toilers of town and countryside). But what else
    are these phrases about the &#8220;rule of labour&#8221; but
    agitation for the trade unions&#8217; independence of the class
    rule of the proletariat? Jointly with the Menshevik~ and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, the whole of the West-European
    bourgeois press is showing concern for, and wailing about, this
    &#8220;independence&#8221; of the trade unions.</p>

    <p>What happened when Martov appeared at the Congress of the
    Independent Social-Democrats in Halle, where, free of any
    constraint from the dictatorship of the Bolsheviks, which he
    dislikes, he said everything he wanted to say? A few days later
    Martov&#8217;s speech was published in its entirety, as a titbit,
    in the most reactionary and imperialist newspapers in
    Britain. These newspapers thanked Citizen Martov for having
    disclosed the designs of the Bolsheviks. (Incidentally, over there
    they use Mr., not Citizen as the form of address.) When such
    speeches are made in the thick of a world-wide struggle against
    us, what are they but a piece of Entente politics? You may, of
    course, say that such a presentation of your ideas of the rule of
    labour, etc., is petty-bourgeois nonsense, but in actual fact, I
    repeat, it is nothing more and nothing less than a piece of
    Entente politics. Tomorrow, if there is an agent of the Entente
    present here, your speech will be sent to all the capitalist
    countries and there printed in millions of copies, so that your
    speech, Citizen Dan, may mislead and dupe the politically
    unintelligent section of the European workers.</p>

    <p>Citizen Dan argued that when I spoke about labour discipline, I
    was advocating only coercion. The Socialist-Revolutionary
    Party&#8217;s representative was more explicit and said that I
    advocated compulsion based on persuasion. Our entire policy is a
    clear reply to this. We do not claim that we make no mistakes; but
    please point out these mistakes and show us better ways of doing
    things. We have heard nothing like that here. Neither the
    Mensheviks nor the Socialist-Revolutionaries say: &#8220;Here
    there is want, here there is destitution among the peasants and
    workers; here is the way to get rid of this poverty.&#8221; No,
    they do not say anything of the kind. They only say that what we
    are doing is compulsion. Yes, that cannot be denied. But we ask
    you, Citizen Dan: Are you for or against? That is the essence, the
    crux of the matter. Answer categorically: yes or no?
    &#8220;Neither yes nor no,&#8221; is the reply. You see, they only
    want to talk about the rule of labour, to say that we are
    encroaching on the freedom of the peasants. But who are the
    peasants? Does not our Soviet Constitution say that the peasants
    are toilers, working people? We respect such peasants and regard
    them as the equals and brothers of the workers. Without such a
    peasantry we could not take a single step in our Soviet
    policy. Between the working peasantry and the workers there is a
    fraternal understanding, embodied in our Constitution. But there
    is another element in the peasantry, the element that constitutes
    a vast &#8220;Sukharevka&#8221;. I hope that any assembly, even of
    non-Party people, will be able to see that after careful
    examination. Do the profiteering peasants represent the working
    people? This is the crux of the economic problems in the rural
    districts. The peasants, as petty proprietors, and the workers are
    two different classes, and we shall abolish the difference between
    them when we abolish the basis of small-scale production, and
    create a new basis of gigantic, large-scale, machine production,
    as I have already pointed out in my report. This is economically
    inevitable, but the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries who
    spoke here came out with incoherent talk of some kind of labour
    equality between all the peasants and the workers. These are mere
    phrases, which are fallacious in terms of economics and are
    refuted by scientific Marxism. Take our revolution in Siberia and
    in Georgia, take the experience of the international revolution,
    and you will see for yourselves that these resonant words about
    labour equality are false. They are part and parcel of the policy
    the bourgeoisie is pursuing against us, and nothing more.</p>

    <p>Dan has asserted here that, in the offices of the Cheka, there
    is a document to the effect that the Mensheviks are not to come
    under the October amnesty; from this Citizen Dan draws the
    conclusion that the Cheka instructs and controls the Presidium of
    the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. Can we, who are in
    power, believe a thing like that? Do not the Communists here, who
    constitute 70 to 80 per cent of all delegates, know that the Cheka
    is headed by Comrade Dzerzhinsky, a member of the Central
    Executive Committee and of the Central Committee of the Party, and
    that in the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive
    Committee there are six members of the Central Committee of our
    Party? There are no grounds whatever for believing that, under
    these circumstances, the Presidium of the Cheka or its Operations
    Department instructs and runs the Presidium of the Central
    Executive Committee. That is simply ridiculous. Of course, there
    is nothing of interest in this, and the representative of the
    Menshevik Party was simply putting on a comedy. I would, however,
    like you to take up, in a few days&#8217; time, any bourgeois
    newspaper published in Western Europe or America in half a million
    or a million copies. There you will find printed in the boldest
    type that Citizen Dan has disclosed that the Cheka instructs and
    controls the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive
    Committee.</p>


    <p class="sub">Speech Delivered At A Meeting Of The R.C P.(B.)
    Group Of The Eighth Congress Of Soviets December 24<a id="bk02"
    href="#fw02" name="bk02"><sup class="enote">[2]</sup></a></p>
  
    <p>Comrades, in the first place I will say a word or two about the
    wrong construction that has been put on the question of force. To
    bring out this wrong construction, I shall read three lines from
    the minutes of the Eighth Congress.<a id="bk03" href="#fw03"
    name="bk03"><sup class="enote">[3]</sup></a></p>

    <p>The whole argument against force was connected with the
    question of the communes. I think that the slightest use of force
    in this sphere will be harmful. Attempts have been made to apply
    this argument&#8212;i.e., that it is foolish to resort to force in
    establishing communes&#8212;to the entire question of persuasion
    and compulsion in general. This is obviously stretching the point,
    and is wrong. As regards the bill we are introducing and the
    exchange of opinions that has commenced, I must say that I think
    that the effort to give the question a more Leftist bias is the
    least business-like. I saw nothing concrete or business-like in
    the proposal made by Comrade Khanov, who claimed to belong to the
    extreme Left. I considered that Comrade Schlichter&#8217;s advice
    to refrain from passing the bill, and leave it to the next session
    of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee to do so, was most
    reprehensible. We in the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars
    tried to lick the bill into shape as quickly as possible so that
    the Congress of Soviets, consisting in the main of representatives
    from the localities, might adopt a final decision. We are
    threatened with the danger of being too late in conducting this
    campaign at district level. To conduct the campaign instructions
    are needed. It must take at least two or three weeks to draw up
    such instructions. There can be nothing more injurious than the
    advice given by Schlichter in his speech on another item of the
    agenda, regarding the rights of the Gubernia Executive
    Committees. In substance, the bill proposes that practical
    measures should at once be taken to assist individual peasant
    farming, which is the predominating system, and that this
    assistance should take the form, not only of encouragement but of
    compulsion as well.</p>

    <p>I must say that the bill definitely indicates the measures we
    have in mind. Clause 11, the most important one, states that the
    Gubernia Sowing Committees may, under the direction and control of
    the People&#8217;s Commissariat of Agriculture, issue
    &#8220;compulsory regulations governing the principal methods of
    mechanical cultivation of the fields and of improving meadows,
    sowing, and the methods of preserving the natural fertility of the
    soil&#8221;. Where are these compulsory regulations to come from?
    The bill goes on to say that the methods mainly employed by the
    more efficient farmers should be adopted. What methods should we
    make compulsory by law? Well-known methods of improving
    agriculture&#8212;these must be made compulsory by law and
    popularised. At the end we read the following: &#8220;It is
    forbidden to introduce regulations and demands: 1) that will cause
    a radical change in peasant farming, unless such regulations and
    demands are proposed by volost congresses, or unless the state
    supplies the given locality with improved implements and means of
    production; 2) that are difficult of fulfilment by the household
    of average means, and 3) that involve risks.&#8221;</p>

    <p>A comrade expressed the opinion that the shortcoming in Comrade
    Osinsky&#8217;s report consisted in its being too practical and
    specific; this, he said, prevented him from presenting the problem
    properly. On the contrary, the most valuable feature of Comrade
    Osinsky&#8217;s report was that he took the bull by the horns and
    called upon you to set to work and discuss immediate practical
    questions, such as the question of seeds, of taking measures to
    prevent seed grain from being consumed. In European Russia this
    will be much more difficult than in the extremely rich Altai
      Region, where, it appears, it is so easy to issue orders. If it
    is so easy to issue orders there, and if you can achieve practical
    results by issuing orders, then every gubernia land
    department&#8212;the Altai or any other&#8212;will deserve the
    utmost encouragement.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, this is far from being the case in the poorer
    gubernias of European Russia. Here, the whole task of the present
    campaign, like the whole task of our Congress, is to keep this
    question as far away as possible from all arguments of a general
    character, which Schlichter and other comrades called upon us to
    indulge in. I would like to call for a more practical and
    business-like presentation of questions, and I welcome the turn
    which Osinsky has given to the matter. Let us discuss the question
    of seeds. They will be consumed, unless we do something about
    preserving them. What is the most practical method of doing that?
    They must be stored in the public granaries, and the peasants must
    be given guarantees that they will not be tied up by red tape and
    improperly distributed. We must convince them that our object at
    present is to put in the safekeeping of the state the quantity of
    seeds required to sow all the fields. We shall certainly convince
    the middle peasant of this, because it is an obvious necessity. If
    any objection is raised, and if some say that they cannot work for
    Tsyurupa, and try to depict him as some sort of beast of prey, we
    will say: &#8220;Stop joking; give us a straight reply to the
    question: How do you propose to restore industry?&#8221; The
    peasants must be supplied with agricultural machinery and
    implements. If the state is to be in a position to meet all
    requirements and to provide all the necessary agricultural and
    technical equipment it will need a steadily growing fund. But we
    are reaching this position very slowly. That is why I think it is
    wrong to confuse the issue with the tasks of the state farms and
    collective farms. The collective farms are not an immediate
    problem. I know that the collective farms are still in such a
    state of disorganisation, in such a deplorable position, that they
    deserve the name of alms-houses. I have no objection to the
    delegates of the Eighth All-Russia Congress impressing on the
    Council of People&#8217;s Commissars or the All-Russia Central
    Executive Committee, the necessity of taking special measures to
    improve the work of the All-Russia Union of Land and Forest
    Workers. In this respect, this union is a bulwark, if only it
    unites in its ranks real semi-proletarian elements who are capable
    of helping us to become real business-like organisers. I have no
    objection to that whatever.</p>

    <p>However, the object of the present bill is a different one. The
    present condition of the overwhelming majority of the state farms
    is below the average. We must base ourselves on the individual
    peasant; we must take him as he is, and he will remain what he is
    for some time to come, and so it is no use dreaming about going
    over to socialism and collectivisation at present. We must drop
    general arguments and discuss the first practical steps we must
    take this very spring, and no later; only such a presentation of
    the question will be business-like. To do that, we must at once
    pass this bill in the form it has been drafted by the Council of
    People&#8217;s Commissars, introduce the necessary changes and
    amendments at once, and not delay matters for a moment.</p>

    <p>As for the socialisation of agricultural implements, I think
    you are best able to judge what compulsory regulations may be
    issued in the name of the state. I would warn you against that. We
    already have a law which grants the right to socialise the
    implements of the rich peasants.<a id="bk04" href="#fw04"
    name="bk04"><sup class="enote">[4]</sup></a> In the districts
    where this can be successfully carried out, complete freedom to
    municipalise these implements is allowed by this law; however, the
    methods to be used are not always and everywhere fully
    established. Therefore, to introduce that into an act whose
    immediate object is different would create the danger of
    scattering our forces instead of concentrating on the most urgent
    tasks and wherever pressure may be needed. Let us rather
    concentrate all our efforts on what is absolutely urgent, on
    collecting a sufficient quantity of seeds at all costs so as to
    ensure that the entire plan of sowing is carried out, and on
    introducing, on a mass scale, and wherever the toilers, the poor
    and middle peasants, predominate, improved methods of farming that
    have been tested by experience. That is the point. The fewer
    measures of this kind we draw up now, the better, because, by
    making sure of carrying out a few measures, we shall put on the
    proper basis the entire machinery for improving agriculture, and
    thoroughly convince the peasants that the road we have taken is
    the right one. If, however, we undertake more than we can do we
    shall discredit ourselves in the eyes of the peasants. If there
    are gubernias where more can be done by issuing orders, there is
    nothing to prohibit that. The bill says: take into account your
    own peasant experience; consider what you are able to do in the
    way of collecting livestock and implements. If agricultural
    implements in good condition are still available in the gubernia
    that will be done successfully. However, to apply the law in
    gubernias where the situation in this respect is far worse and
    where the peasants are unable to carry out such orders means that
    the orders will remain a dead letter and will be left hanging in
    mid-air, as it were; instead of understanding the importance of
    these measures, the peasants will be disappointed, and that is
    what I fear most of all for the future. That is why we must first
    of all start with what is absolutely essential, that is, with
    preserving the seeds.</p>

    <p>Let us now go over to the measures for improving small peasant
    individual farming, which are quite feasible and must be discussed
    immediately, in detail, and here decreed and made compulsory by
    law, to be enforced by order and compulsion, so that what is
    passed after repeated discussion shall be carried out without
    fail. I would propose that we at once set up committees, without
    waiting until the committees are formed officially at the plenary
    session of the Congress after the report. This unofficial
    committee can be set up at once, or at all events some time
    today. The official committee can be set up later, but it would be
    a mistake to put this off for a day, or even half a day. We have a
    total of 2,500 delegates, and I think that at least one-tenth of
    this number have a practical knowledge of this question, after
    several years of work; if we have 250, that is, over 25 for each
    district, since our Republic is divided up into nine agricultural
    districts, I think this number of representatives is sufficient to
    enable us to proceed at once to a discussion of the practical
    questions, the concrete measures we should adopt.</p>

    <p>What measures to improve agriculture should be adopted in the
    various districts? In one district, perhaps, steps may be taken
    towards compulsory sowing; in another, perhaps, the ground may be
    prepared for a more vigorous order, like the one proposed by the
    comrade who investigated conditions in the Altai Gubernia only
    this spring. In still another district, perhaps, measures could be
    taken, with the help of agronomists and non-Party peasants, for
    more timely ploughing and harrowing. I think we ought at once to
    form committees and divide the regions into districts, since the
    same measures cannot be employed in all districts, and devote a
    half a day or a day to the discussion of questions that are not
    directly mentioned in the decree, but constitute the most
    important part of the bill. This bill says: appropriate measures
    should be taken to convince the non-Party peasants. If we are
    lagging behind in this respect, then, with the mass agitation
    which we are developing and will develop a hundred times more
    vigorously and widely than we have done up to now, we can draw up
    measures for each district and each gubernia; we shall endeavour
    to make them successful, and do that no less strenuously than we
    did when we strove to achieve success in our food policy. In the
    latter case the task was not so complex: we demanded that the
    peasants yield up a certain quantity of foodstuffs. Here, however,
    we are demanding that the peasants introduce on their own farms
    the changes which the state regards as necessary. The chief thing
    is to make no mistake in defining these changes. That is the most
    important thing. The fact that Comrade Kurayev put these questions
    concretely indicates that he is on the right track; however to go
    over from this to arguments about the general plan of
    collectivisation, the role of the state farms, which sometimes
    play a very nasty role, and the Marxist method of approach to
    purchases, means dragging us away from the immediately practical
    affairs, back to general arguments which may be useful, but not at
    a Congress of Soviets which is to pass a law of supreme
    importance. To prepare the ground for this step, we must carefully
    consider what the activities and role of the village Soviets
    should be. We must carefully consider whether the chairman of a
    village Soviet is the person to be consulted, since he is mainly
    responsible for carrying out these measures among the
    peasants. Will it be useful to combine the functions of chairman
    of the village Soviet and of chairman of the Committee of
    Assistance in one person? I am throwing this out as a
    suggestion. I would like the comrades who are familiar with the
    work at district level to pay careful attention to this
    question. The Committees of Assistance ought to discuss what
    measures should be made compulsory by law. In discussing this
    question there is no need to be afraid of non-Party people. We
    shall carefully weigh all their proposals, and we shall know
    definitely who is for us and who is against us. Clarity must be
    achieved in every volost and every village. The demands proposed
    are quite feasible and, with a certain amount of effort, they can
    be carried out this spring. I would propose that this conference
    of the group now adjourn. When you consider that the general
    debate has ended, we should form committees for the various
    districts with specific agricultural conditions, and immediately
    proceed to discuss the question. That will be the proper thing to
    do from the practical point of view, and will ensure the success
    of the bill. </p>

      after hearing the
      report of the Chairman of the State Commission for the
      Electrification of Russia, expresses its thanks, in the first
      place, to the Presidium of tho Supreme Council of the National
      Economy and also to the People&#8217;s Commissariat of Agriculture
      and the People &#8217;s Commissariat of Railways, and particularly
      to the Commission for the Electrification of Russia for their work
      in drawing up the plan for the electrification of Russia.</p>
    
    <p>The Congress instructs the All-Russia Central Executive
      Committee, the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars, the Council
      of Labour and Defence, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the
      National Economy and also the other People&#8217;s Commissariats
      to complete the elaboration of this plan and to endorse it without
      fail at the earliest date.</p>

    <p>The Congress further instructs the government and requests the
      All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions and the All-Russia
      Congress of Trade Unions to take all measures to conduct the
      widest possible propaganda for this plan and to make the broadest
      sections of the population in town and countryside familiar with
      it. The study of this plan must be introduced into all educational
      establishments in the Republic without exception; every electric
      power station and every tolerably well organised factory and state
      farm must become a centre for teaching the principles of
      electricity and modern industry, a centre of propaganda for the
      plan of electrification, and of its systematic study. All persons
      possessing sufficient scientific or practical knowledge must be
      mobilised for the purpose of conducting propaganda for the
      electrification plan and for imparting to others the knowledge
      necessary to understand it.</p>

    <p>The Congress expresses its firm conviction that all Soviet
      institutions, all Soviets, and all industrial workers and working
      peasants will exert every effort and shrink from no sacrifice to
      carry out the plan for the electrification of Russia at all costs,
      and despite all obstacles. </p>

    On December 22, 1920, Lenin attended a private conference of
    non-Party peasant delegates to the Eighth Congress of Soviets,
    which was called on Lenin&#8217;s request by M. I. Kalinin, then
    Chairman of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. The
    conference discussed the bill on measures to strengthen and
    develop agriculture adopted by the Council of People&#8217;s
    Commissars on December 14, and submitted for consideration by the
    Congress. Lenin closely followed the debate, and took notes of the
    speeches.</p>
 
    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw02" href="#bk02" name="fw02">[2]</a>
    The meeting of the Communist group of the Congress, called in the
    morning of December 24, 1920, was devoted to a discussion of the
    bill presented by the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars on
    measures to promote peasant farming.</p>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw03" href="#bk03"
    name="fw03">[3]</a>Lenin is referring to the following passage in
    his report on work in the countryside, which he delivered at the
    Eighth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) on March 23, 1919:
    &#8220;Coercion applied to the middle peasants would cause untold
    harm&#8221; (see present edition <a
    href="../../1919/rcp8th/index.htm">Vol. 29, p. 210</a>) 

    </p>
    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw04" href="#bk04"
    name="fw04">[4]</a>The reference is to the law on the
    socialisation of the land passed on January 18 (31), 1918, by the
    Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets which was held on January
    10-18 (23-31), 1918. Clause 6 of the law read: &#8220;All
    livestock and agricultural implements in private possession shall
    pass, without indemnification, from the hands of the non-working
    farmers exploiting the labour of others into the hands of uyezd,
    gubernia, regional and federative Soviets, depending on the
    importance of the implements and livestock transferred.&#8221;
