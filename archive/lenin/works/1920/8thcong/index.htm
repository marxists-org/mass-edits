    The Congress was held in Moscow from December 22 to 29,
    1920. There was a record attendance of 2,537 delegates, of whom
    1,728 had full voting rights, and 809 had deliberative votes.</p> 

    <p class="endnote">The Congress met at a time when the Soviet
    Republic had won victory over the foreign interventionists and
    internal counter-revolution, and the economic front, as Lenin
    said, had become &#8220;the main, the principal front&#8221;. </p> 

    <p class="endnote"> The Congress was guided by Lenin, who
    delivered a report on the work of the All-Russia Central Executive
    Committee and the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars, and a
    speech closing the debate on his report at plenary sessions of the
    Congress on December 22 and 23. He also took the floor six times
    at sittings of the Communist group of the Congress on December 21,
    22, 24 and 27 to deal with the question of concessions and the
    bill on measures to strengthen and develop peasant farming. </p> 

    <p class="endnote"> After the debate on Lenin&#8217;s report, the
    Congress passed a resolution by an overwhelming majority,
    approving the activities of the Soviet Government. The delegates
    gave a concerted rebuff to representatives of the petty-bourgeois
    parties who made a number of anti-Soviet declarations at the
    Congress and tabled a draft resolution of their own.</p> 

    <p class="endnote"> The Congress adopted the plan for the
    electrification of Russia which was drawn up on Lenin&#8217;s
    initiative and in keeping with his directions. This was the first
    long-term economic plan of the Soviet state, which Lenin called
    &#8220;the Party&#8217;s second programme&#8221;. The resolution
    adopted on Krzhizhanovsky &#8217;s report was drafted by Lenin
    (see <a href="ch03.htm#n352n">p. 532</a> in this volume).</p> 

    <p class="endnote"> One of the most important questions on the
    agenda was the bill on measures to strengthen and develop peasant
    farming, passed by the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars on
    December 1-4, 1920. Lenin participated in the discussion of the
    main clauses of the law at a private meeting of non-Party peasant
    delegates onDecember 22 and in the Communist group of the Congress
    on December 24 and 27. The Congress unanimously approved the
    bill. </p> 

    <p class="endnote"> The transition to peaceful construction called
    for the improvement and reorganisation of the entire Soviet
    apparatus. The Congress passed a detailed resolution on the
    question, setting up proper relations between central and local
    administrative bodies. The Congress dealt extensively with
    questions relating to the reorganisation of the entire system of
    economic management to meet the new tasks. The delegates discussed
    and approved a new statute of the Council of Labour and
    Defence.</p> 

    <p class="endnote"> The Congress instituted the Order of the Red
    Banner of Labour to be awarded for labour heroism, initiative and
    organisation in solving economic tasks.</p>
