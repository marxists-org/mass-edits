    <p class="fst">(The Congress greets Lenin with a tremendous ovation.)

      <span class="cap">C</span>omrades, today I would
      like to talk on the fundamental tasks of the Young Communist
      League and, in this connection, on what the youth organisations
      in a socialist republic should be like in general.

    </p>
    <p>It is all the more necessary to dwell on this question because
      in a certain sense it may be said that it is the youth that will
      be faced with the actual task of creating a communist
      society. For it is clear that the generation of working people
      brought up in capitalist society can, at best, accomplish the
      task of destroying the foundations of the old, the capitalist
      way of life, which was built on exploitation. At best it will be
      able to accomplish the tasks of creating a social system that
      will help the proletariat and the working classes retain power
      and lay a firm foundation, which can be built on only by a
      generation that is starting to work under the new conditions, in
      a situation in which relations based on the exploitation of man
      by man no longer exist.

    </p>
    <p>And so, in dealing from this angle with the tasks confronting
      the youth, I must say that the tasks of the youth in general,
      and of the Young Communist Leagues and all other organisations
      in particular, might be summed up in a single word: learn.

    </p>
    <p>Of course, this is only a "single word". It does not reply to
      the principal and most essential questions: what to learn, and
      how to learn? And the whole point here is that, with the
      transformation of the old, capitalist society, the upbringing,
      training and education of the new generations that will create
      the communist society cannot be conducted on the old lines. The
      teaching, training and education of the youth must proceed from
      the material that has been left to us by the old society.  We
      can build communism only on the basis of the totality of
      knowledge, organisations and institutions, only by using the
      stock of human forces and means that have been left to us by the
      old society. Only by radically remoulding the teaching,
      organisation and training of the youth shall we be able to
      ensure that the efforts of the younger generation will result in
      the creation of a society that will be unlike the old society,
      i.e., in the creation of a communist society. That is why we
      must deal in detail with the question of what we should teach
      the youth and how the youth should learn if it really wants to
      justify the name of communist youth, and how it should be
      trained so as to be able to complete and consummate what we have
      started.

    </p>
    <p>I must say that the first and most natural reply would
      seem to be that the Youth League, and the youth in general, who want to
      advance to communism, should learn communism.

    </p>
    <p>But this reply -- "learn communism" -- is too general.  What do
      we need in order to learn communism? What must be singled out
      from the sum of general knowledge so as to acquire a knowledge
      of communism?  Here a number of dangers arise, which very often
      manifest themselves whenever the task of learning communism is
      presented incorrectly, or when it is interpreted in too
      one-sided a manner.

    </p>
    <p>Naturally, the first thought that enters one's mind is that
      learning communism means assimilating the sum of knowledge that
      is contained in communist manuals, pamphlets and books. But such
      a definition of the study of communism would be too crude and
      inadequate. If the study of communism consisted solely in
      assimilating what is contained in communist books and pamphlets,
      we might all too easily obtain communist text-jugglers or
      braggarts, and this would very often do us harm, because such
      people, after learning by rote what is set forth in communist
      books and pamphlets, would prove incapable of combining the
      various branches of knowledge, and would be unable to act in the
      way communism really demands.

    </p>
    <p>One of the greatest evils and misfortunes left to us by the
      old, capitalist society is the complete rift between books and
      practical life; we have had books explaining everything in the
      best possible manner, yet in most cases these books contained
      the most pernicious and hypocritical lies, a false description
      of capitalist society.

    </p>
    <p>That is why it would be most mistaken merely to assimilate book
      knowledge about communism. No longer do our speeches and
      articles merely reiterate what used to be said about communism,
      because our speeches and articles are connected with our daily
      work in all fields. Without work and without struggle, book
      knowledge of communism obtained from communist pamphlets and
      works is absolutely worthless, for it would continue the old
      separation of theory and practice, the old rift which was the
      most pernicious feature of the old, bourgeois society.

    </p>
    <p>It would be still more dangerous to set about assimilating only
      communist slogans. Had we not realised this danger in time, and
      had we not directed all our efforts to averting this danger, the
      half million or million young men and women who would have
      called themselves Communists after studying communism in this
      way would only greatly prejudice the cause of communism.

    </p>
    <p>The question arises: how is all this to be blended for the
      study of communism? What must we take from the old schools, from
      the old kind of science? It was the declared aim of the old type
      of school to produce men with an all-round education, to teach
      the sciences in general.  We know that this was utterly false,
      since the whole of society was based and maintained on the
      division of people into classes, into exploiters and
      oppressed. Since they were thoroughly imbued with the class
      spirit, the old schools naturally gave knowledge only to the
      children of the bourgeoisie.  Every word was falsified in the
      interests of the bourgeoisie. In these schools the younger
      generation of workers and peasants were not so much educated as
      drilled in the interests of that bourgeoisie. They were trained
      in such a way as to be useful servants of the bourgeoisie, able
      to create profits for it without disturbing its peace and
      leisure. That is why, while rejecting the old type of schools,
      we have made it our task to take from it only what we require
      for genuine communist education.

    </p>
    <p>This brings me to the reproaches and accusations which we
      constantly hear levelled at the old schools, and which often
      lead to wholly wrong conclusions. It is said that the old school
      was a school of purely book knowledge, of ceaseless drilling and
      grinding. That is true, but we must distinguish between what was
      bad in the old schools and what is useful to us, and we must be
      able to select from it what is necessary for communism.

    </p>
    <p>The old schools provided purely book knowledge; they compelled
      their pupils to assimilate a mass of useless, superfluous and
      barren knowledge, which cluttered up the brain and turned the
      younger generation into bureaucrats regimented according to a
      single pattern. But it would mean falling into a grave error for
      you to try to draw the conclusion that one can become a
      Communist without assimilating the wealth of knowledge amassed
      by mankind.  It would be mistaken to think it sufficient to
      learn communist slogans and the conclusions of communist
      science, without acquiring that sum of knowledge of which
      communism itself is a result. Marxism is an example which shows
      how communism arose out of the sum of human knowledge.

    </p>
    <p>You have read and heard that communist theory -- the science of
      communism created in the main by Marx, this doctrine of Marxism
      -- has ceased to be the work of a single socialist of the
      nineteenth century, even though he was a genius, and that it has
      become the doctrine of millions and tens of millions of
      proletarians all over the world, who are applying it in their
      struggle against capitalism. If you were to ask why the
      teachings of Marx have been able to win the hearts and minds of
      millions and tens of millions of the most revolutionary class,
      you would receive only one answer: it was because Marx based his
      work on the firm foundation of the human knowledge acquired
      under capitalism. After making a study of the laws governing the
      development of human society, Marx realised the inevitability of
      capitalism developing towards communism. What is most important
      is that he proved this on the sole basis of a most precise,
      detailed and profound study of this capitalist society, by fully
      assimilating all that earlier science had produced. He
      critically reshaped everything that had been created by human
      society, without ignoring a single detail. He reconsidered,
      subjected to criticism, and verified on the working-class
      movement everything that human thinking had created, and
      therefrom formulated conclusions which people hemmed in by
      bourgeois limitations or bound by bourgeois prejudices could not
      draw.

    </p>
    <a name="2.1"></a>
    <p>We must bear this in mind when, for
      example, we talk about proletarian culture.<span class="note"><a
	  href="#2">[2]</a></span> We shall be unable to solve this problem
      unless we clearly realise that only a precise knowledge and
    transformation of the culture created by the entire development of
    mankind will enable us to create a proletarian culture. The latter
    is not clutched out of thin air; it is not an invention of those
    who call themselves experts in proletarian culture. That is all
    nonsense. Proletarian culture must be the logical development of
    the store of knowledge mankind has accumulated under the yoke of
    capitalist, landowner and bureaucratic society. All these roads
    have been leading, and will continue to lead up to proletarian
    culture, in the same way as political economy, as reshaped by
    Marx, has shown us what human society must arrive at, shown us the
    passage to the class struggle, to the beginning of the proletarian
    revolution.

    </p>
    <p>When we so often hear representatives of the youth, as well as
      certain advocates of a new system of education, attacking the
      old schools, claiming that they used the system of cramming, we
      say to them that we must take what was good in the old
      schools. We must not borrow the system of encumbering young
      people's minds with an immense acount of knowledge, nine-tenths
      of which was useless and one-tenth distorted. This, however,
      does not mean that we can restrict ourselves to communist
      conclusions and learn only communist slogans. You will not
      create communism that way.  You can become a Communist only when
      you enrich your mind with a knowledge of all the treasures
      created by mankind.

    </p>
    <p>We have no need of cramming, but we do need to develop and
      perfect the mind of every student with a knowledge of
      fundamental facts.  Communism will become an empty word, a mere
      signboard, and a Communist a mere boaster, if all the knowledge
      he has acquired is not digested in his mind. You should not
      merely assimilate this knowledge, but assimilate it critically,
      so as not to cram your mind with useless lumber, but enrich it
      with all those facts that are indispensable to the well-educated
      man of today. If a Communist took it into his head to boast
      about his communism becaused of the cut-and-dried conclusions he
      had acquired, without putting in a great deal of serious and
      hard work and without understanding facts he should examine
      critically, he would be a deplorable Communist indeed.  Such
      superficiality would be decidedly fatal. If I know that I know
      little, I shall strive to learn more; but if a man says that he
      is a Communist and that he need not know anything thoroughly, he
      will never become anything like a Communist.

    </p>
    <p>The old schools produced servants needed by the capitalists;
      the old schools turned men of science into men who had to write
      and say whatever pleased the capitalists. We must therefore
      abolish them. But does the fact that we must abolish them,
      destroy them, mean that we should not take from them everything
      mankind has accumulated that is essential to man? Does it mean
      that we do not have to distinguish between what was necessary to
      capitalism and what is necessary to communism?

    </p>
    <p>We are replacing the old drill-sergeant methods practised in
      bourgeois society, against the will of the majority, with the
      class-conscious discipline of the workers and peasants, who
      combine hatred of the old society with a determination, ability
      and readiness to unite and organise their forces for this
      struggle so as to forge the wills of millions and hundreds of
      millions of people -- disunited, and scattered over the
      territory of a huge country -- into a single will, without which
      defeat is inevitable.  Without this solidarity, without this
      conscious descipline of the workers and peasants, our cause is
      hopeless. Without this, we shall be unable to vanquish the
      capitalists and landowners of the whole world. We shall not even
      consolidate the foundation, let alone build a new, communist
      society on that foundation. Likewise, while condemning the old
      schools, while harbouring an absolutely justified and necessary
      hatred for the old schools, and appreciating the readiness to
      destroy them, we must realise that we must replace the old
      system of instruction, the old cramming and the old drill, with
      an ability to acquire the sum total of human knowledge, and to
      acquire it in such a way that communism shall not be something
      to be learned by rote, but something that you yourselves have
      thought over, something that will embody conclusions inevitable
      from the standpoint of present-day education.

    </p>
    <p>That is the way the main tasks should be presented when
      we speak of the aim: learn communism.

    </p>
    <p>I shall take a practical example to make this clear to you, and
      to demonstrate the approach to the problem of how you must
      learn.  You all know that, following the military problems,
      those of defending the republic, we are now confronted with
      economic tasks. Communist society, as we know, cannot be built
      unless we restore industry and agriculture, and that, not in the
      old way. They must be re-established on a modern basis, in
      accordance with the last word in science. You know that
      electricity is that basis, and that only after electrification
      of the entire country, of all branches of industry and
      agriculture, only when you have achieved that aim, will you be
      able to build for youselves the communist society which the
      older generation will not be able to build. Confronting you is
      the task of economically reviving the whole country, of
      reorganising and restoring both agriculture and industry on
      modern technical lines, based on modern science and technology,
      on electricity. You realise perfectly well that illiterate
      people cannot tackle electrification, and that elementary
      literacy is not enough either. It is insufficient to understand
      what electricity is; what is needed is the knowledge of how to
      apply it technically in industry and agriculture, and in the
      individual branches of industry and agriculture.  This has to be
      learnt for oneself, and it must be taught to the entire rising
      generation of working people. That is the task confronting every
      class-conscious Communist, every young person who regards
      himself a Communist and who clearly understands that, by joining
      the Young Communist League, he has pledged himself to help the
      Party build communism and to help the whole younger generation
      create a communist society. He must realise that he can create
      it only on the basis of modern education, and if he does not
      acquire this education communism will remain merely a pious
      wish.

    </p>
    <p>It was the task of the older generation to overthrow the
      bourgeoisie. The main task then was to criticise the
      bourgeoisie, arouse hatred of the bourgeoisie among the masses,
      and foster class-consciousness and the ability to unite their
      forces. The new generation is confronted with a far more complex
      task. Your duty does not lie only in assembling your forces so
      as to uphold the workers' and peasants' government against an
      invasion instigated by the capitalists. Of course, you must do
      that; that is something you clearly realise, and is distinctly
      seen by the Communist.  However, that is not enough. You have to
      build up a communist society.  In many respects half of the work
      has been done. The old order has been destroyed, just as it
      deserved, it has been turned into a heap of ruins, just as it
      deserved. The ground has been cleared, and on this ground the
      younger communist generation must build a communist society. You
      are faced with the task of construction, and you can accomplish
      that task only by assimilating all modern knowledge, only if you
      are able to transform communism from cut-and-dried and memorised
      formulas, counsels, recipes, prescriptions and programmes into
      that living reality which gives unity to your immediate work,
      and only if you are able to make communism a guide in all your
      practical work.

    </p>
    <p>That is the task you should pursue in educating, training and
      rousing the entire younger generation. You must be foremost
      among the millions of builders of a communist society in whose
      ranks every young man and young woman should be. You will not
      build a communist society unless you enlist the mass of young
      workers and peasants in the work of building communism.

    </p>
    <p>This naturally brings me to the question of how we should
      teach communism and what the specific features of our methods should be.

    </p>
    <p>I first of all shall deal here with the question of communist
      ethics.

    </p>
    <p>You must train yourselves to be Communists. It is the task of
      the Youth League to organize its practical activities in such a
      way that, by learning, organising, uniting and fighting, its
      members shall train both themselves and all those who look to it
      for leadership; it should train Communists. The entire purpose
      of training, educating and teaching the youth of today should be
      to imbue them with communist ethics.

    </p>
    <p>But is there such a thing as communist ethics? Is there such a
      thing as communist morality? Of course, there is. It is often
      suggested that we have no ethics of our own; very often the
      bourgeoisie accuse us Communists of rejecting all morality. This
      is a method of confusing the issue, of throwing dust in the eyes
      of the workers and peasants.

    </p>
    <p>In what sense do we reject ethics, reject morality?

    </p>
    <p>In the sense given to it by the bourgeoisie, who based ethics
      on God's commandments. On this point we, of course, say that we
      do not believe in God, and that we know perfectly well that the
      clergy, the landowners and the bourgeoisie invoked the name of
      God so as to further their own interests as exploiters. Or,
      instead of basing ethics on the commandments of morality, on the
      commandments of God, they based it on idealist or semi-idealist
      phrases, which always amounted to something very similar to
      God's commandments.

    </p>
    <p>We reject any morality based on extra-human and extra-class
      concepts. We say that this is deception, dupery, stultification of the
      workers and peasants in the interests of the landowners and capitalists.

    </p>
    <p>We say that our morality is entirely subordinated to the
      interests of the proletariat's class struggle. Our morality stems from
      the interests of the class struggle of the proletariat.

    </p>
    <p>The old society was based on the oppression of all the workers
      and peasants by the landowners and capitalists. We had to
      destroy all that, and overthrow them but to do that we had to
      create unity. That is something that God cannot create.

    </p>
    <p>This unity could be provided only by the factories, only by a
      proletariat trained and roused from its long slumber. Only when
      that class was formed did a mass movement arise which has led to
      what we have now -- the victory of the proletarian revolution in
      one of the weakest of countries, which for three years has been
      repelling the onslaught of the bourgeoisie of the whole
      world. We can see how the proletarian revolution is developing
      all over the world. On the basis of experience, we now say that
      only the proletariat could have created the solid force which
      the disunited and scattered peasantry are following and which
      has withstood all onslaughts by the exploiters. Only this class
      can help the working masses unite, rally their ranks and
      conclusively defend, conclusively consolidate and conclusively
      build up a communist society.

    </p>
    <p>That is why we say that to us there is no such thing as
      a morality that stands outside human society; that is a fraud. To us morality
      is subordinated to the interests of the proletariat's class struggle.

    </p>
    <p>What does that class struggle consist in? It consists
      in overthrowing the tsar, overthrowing the capitalists, and abolishing
      the capitalist class.

    </p>
    <p>What are classes in general? Classes are that which permits one
      section of society to appropriate the labour of another
      section. If one section of society appropriates all the land, we
      have a landowner class and a peasant class. If one section of
      society owns the factories, shares and capital, while another
      section works in these factories, we have a capitalist class and
      a proletarian class.

    </p>
    <p>It was not difficult to drive out the tsar -- that required
      only a few days. It was not very difficult to drive out the
      landowners -- that was done in a few months. Nor was it very
      difficult to drive out the capitalists. But it is incomparably
      more difficult to abolish classes; we still have the division
      into workers and peasants. If the peasant is installed on his
      plot of land and appropriates his surplus grain, that is, grain
      that he does not need for himself or for his cattle, while the
      rest of the people have to go without bread, then the peasant
      becomes an exploiter. The more grain he clings to, the more
      profitable he finds it; as for the rest, let them starve: "The
      more they starve, the dearer I can sell this grain." All should
      work according to a single common plan, on common land, in
      common factories and in accordance with a common system.  Is
      that easy to attain? You see that it is not as easy as driving
      out the tsar, the landowners and the capitalists. What is
      required is that the proletariat re-educate a section of the
      peasantry; it must win over the working peasants in order to
      crush the resistance of those peasants who are rich and are
      profiting from the poverty and want of the rest. Hence the task
      of the proletarian struggle is not quite completed after we have
      overthrown the tsar and driven out the landowners and
      capitalists; to accomplish that is the task of the system we
      call the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    </p>
    <p>The class struggle is continuing; it has merely changed its
      forms. It is the class struggle of the proletariat to prevent
      the return of the old exploiters, to unite in a single union the
      scattered masses of unenlightened peasants. The class struggle
      is continuing and it is our task to subordinate all interests to
      that struggle. Our communist morality is also subordinated to
      that task. We say: morality is what serves to destroy the old
      exploiting society and to unite all the working people around
      the proletariat, which is building up a new, communist society.

    </p>
    <p>Communist morality is that which serves this struggle and
      unites the working people against all exploitation, against all
      petty private property; for petty property puts into the hands
      of one person that which has been created by the labour of the
      whole of society. In our country the land is common property.

    </p>
    <p>But suppose I take a piece of this common property and grow on
      it twice as much grain as I need, and profiteer on the surplus?
      Suppose I argue that the more starving people there are, the
      more they will pay? Would I then be behaving like a Communist?
      No, I would be behaving like an exploiter, like a
      proprietor. That must be combated. If that is allowed to go on,
      things will revert to the rule of the capitalists, to the rule
      of the bourgeoisie, as has more than once happened in previous
      revolutions. To prevent the restoration of the rule of the
      capitalists and the bourgeoisie, we must not allow profiteering;
      we must not allow individuals to enrich themselves at the
      expense of the rest; the working people must unite with the
      proletariat and form a communist society. This is the principal
      feature of the fundamental task of the League and the
      organisation of the communist youth.

    </p>
    <p>Th old society was based on the principle: rob or be robbed;
      work for others or make others work for you; be a slave-owner or
      a slave.  Naturally, people brought up in such a society
      assimilate with their mother's milk, one might say, the
      psychology, the habit, the concept which says: you are either a
      slave-owner or a slave, or else, a small owner, a petty
      employee, a petty official, or an intellectual -- in short, a
      man who is concerned only with himself, and does not care a rap
      for anybody else.

    </p>
    <p>If I work this plot of land, I do not care a rap for anybody
      else; if others starve, all the better, I shall get the more for
      my grain.  If I have a job as a doctor, engineer, teacher, or
      clerk, I do not care a rap for anybody else. If I toady to and
      please the powers that be, I may be able to keep my job, and
      even get on in life and become a bourgeois.  A Communist cannot
      harbour such a psychology and such sentiments. When the workers
      and peasants proved that they were able, by their own efforts,
      to defend themselves and create a new society -- that was the
      beginning of the new and communist education, education in the
      struggle against the exploiters, education in alliance with the
      proletariat against the self-seekers and petty proprietors,
      against the psychology and habits which say: I seek my own
      profit and don't care a rap for anything else.

    </p>
    <p>That is the reply to the question of how the young and
      rising generation should learn communism.

    </p>
    <p>It can learn communism only by linking up every step in its
      studies, training and education with the continuous struggle the
      proletarians and the working people are waging against the old
      society of exploiters.  When people tell us about morality, we
      say: to a Communist all morality lies in this united discipline
      and conscious mass struggle against the exploiters. We do not
      believe in an eternal morality, and we expose the falseness of
      all the fables about morality. Morality serves the purpose of
      helping human society rise to a higher level and rid itself of
      the exploitation of labour.

    </p>
    <p>To achieve this we need that generation of young people who
      began to reach political maturity in the midst of a disciplined
      and desperate struggle against the bourgeoisie. In this struggle
      that generation is training genuine Communists; it must
      subordinate to this struggle, and link up with it, each step in
      its studies, education and training. The education of the
      communist youth must consist, not in giving them suave talks and
      moral precepts. This is not what education consists in. When
      people have seen the way in which their fathers and mothers
      lived under the yoke of the landowners and capitalists; when
      they have themselves experienced the sufferings of those who
      began the struggle against the exploiters; when they have seen
      the sacrifices made to keep what has been won, and seen what
      deadly enemies the landowners and capitalists are -- they are
      taught by these conditions to become Communists. Communist
      morality is based on the struggle for the consolidation and
      completion of communism.  That is also the basis of communist
      training, education, and teaching.  That is the reply to the
      question of how communism should be learnt.

    </p>
    <p>We could not believe in teaching, training and education if
      they were restricted only to the schoolroom and divorced from
      the ferment of life. As long as the workers and peasants are
      oppressed by the landowners and capitalists, and as long as the
      schools are controlled by the landowners and capitalists, the
      young generation will remain blind and ignorant. Our schools
      must provide the youth with the fundamentals of knowledge, the
      ability to evolve communist views independently; they must make
      educated people of the youth. While they are attending school,
      they must learn to become participants in the struggle for
      emancipation from the exploiters.  The Young Communist League
      will justify its name as the League of the young communist
      generation only when every step in its teaching, training and
      education is linked up with participation in the common struggle
      of all working people against the exploiters. You are well aware
      that, as long as Russia remains the only workers' republic and
      the old, bourgeois system exists in the rest of the world, we
      shall be weaker than they are, and be constantly threatened with
      a new attack; and that only if we learn to be solidly united
      shall we win in the further struggle and -- having gained
      strength -- become really invincible. Thus, to be a Communist
      means that you must organise and unite the entire young
      generation and set an example of training and discipline in this
      struggle. Then you will be able to start building the edifice of
      communist society and bring it to completion.

    </p>
    <p>To make this clearer to you, I shall quote an example.  We call
      ourselves Communists. What is a Communist? Communist is a Latin
      word. <i>Communis</i> is the Latin for "common". Communist
      society is a society in which all things -- the land, the
      factories -- are owned in common and the people work in
      common. That is communism.

    </p>
    <p>Is it possible to work in common if each one works separately
      on his own plot of land? Work in common cannot be brought about
      all at once. That is impossible. It does not drop from the
      skies. It comes through toil and suffering; it is created in the
      course of struggle. The old books are of no use here; no one
      will believe them. One's own experience of life is neeeded. When
      Kolchak and Denikin were advancing from Siberia and the South,
      the peasants were on their side. They did not like Bolshevism
      because the Bolsheviks took their grain at a fixed price. But
      when the peasants in Siberia and the Ukraine experienced the
      rule of Kolchak and Denikin, they realised that they had only
      one alternative: either to go to the capitalists, who would at
      once hand them over into slavery under the landowners; or to
      follow the workers, who, it is true, did not promise a land
      flowing with milk and honey, and demanded iron discipline and
      firmness in an arduous struggle, but would lead them out of
      enslavement by the capitalists and landowners. When even the
      ignorant peasant saw and realised this from their own
      experience, they became conscious adherents of communism, who
      had gone through a severe school. It is such experience that
      must form the basis of all the activities of the Young Communist
      League.

    </p>
    <p>I have replied to the questions of what we must learn, what we
      must take from the old schools and from the old science. I shall
      now try to answer the question of how this must be learnt. The
      answer is: only by inseparably linking each step in the
      activities of the schools, each step in training, education and
      teaching, with the struggle of all the working people against
      the exploiters.

    </p>
    <p>I shall quote a few examples from the experience of the work of
      some of the youth organisations so as to illustrate how this
      training in communism should proceed. Everybody is talking about
      abolishing illiteracy.  You know that a communist society cannot
      be built in an illiterate country.  It is not enough for the
      Soviet government to issue an order, or for the Party to issue a
      particular slogan, or to assign a certain number of the best
      workers to this task. The young generation itself must take up
      this work. Communism means that the youth, the young men and
      women who belong to the Youth League, should say: this is our
      job; we shall unite and go into the rural districts to abolish
      illiteracy, so that there shall be no illiterates among our
      young people. We are trying to get the rising generation to
      devote their activities to this work. You know that we cannot
      rapidly transform an ignorant and illiterate Russia into a
      literate country.  But if the Youth League sets to work on the
      job, and if all young people work for the benefit of all, the
      League, with a membership of 400,000 young men and women, will
      be entitled to call itself a Young Communist League.  It is also
      a task of the League, not only to acquire knowledge itself, but
      to help those young people who are unable to extricate
      themselves by their own efforts from the toils of
      illiteracy. Being a member of the Youth League means devoting
      one's labour and efforts to the common cause. That is what a
      communist education means. Only in the course of such work do
      young men and women become real Communists. Only if they achieve
      practical results in this work will they become Communists.

    </p>
    <p>Take, for example, work in the suburban vegetable gardens.  Is
      that not a real job of work? It is one of the tasks of the Young
      Communist League. People are starving; there is hunger in the
      factories. To save ourselves from starvation, vegetable gardens
      must be developed. But farming is being carried on in the old
      way. Therefore, more class-conscious elements should engage in
      this work, and then you will find that the number of vegetable
      gardens will increase, their acreage will grow, and the results
      will improve.  The Young Communist League must take an active
      part in this work. Every League and League branch should regard
      this as its duty.

    </p>
    <p>The Young Communist League must be a shock force, helping in
      every job and displaying initiative and enterprise. The League
      should be an organisation enabling any worker to see that it
      consists of people whose teachings he perhaps does not
      understand, and whose teachings he may not immediately believe,
      but from whose practical work and activity he can see that they
      are really people who are showing him the right road.

    </p>
    <p>If the Young Communist League fails to organise its work in
      this way in all fields, it will mean that it is reverting to the
      old bourgeois path. We must combine our education with the
      struggle of the working people against the exploiters, so as to
      help the former accomplish the tasks set by the teachings of
      communism.

    </p>
    <p>The members of the League should use every spare hour to
      improve the vegetable gardens, or to organise the education of
      young people at some factory, and so on. We want to transform
      Russia from a poverty-stricken and wretched country into one
      that is wealthy. The Young Communist League must combine its
      education, learning and training with the labour of the workers
      and peasants, so as not to confine itself to schools or to
      reading communist books and pamphlets. Only by working side by
      side with the workers and peasants can one become a genuine
      Communist. It has to be generally realised that all members of
      the Youth League are literate poeple and at the same time are
      keen at their jobs. When everyone sees that we have ousted the
      old drill-ground methods from the old schools and have replaced
      them with conscious discipline, that all young men and women
      take part in subbotniks, and utilise every suburban farm to help
      the population -- people will cease to regard labour in the old
      way.

    </p>
    <p>It is the taks of the Young Communist League to organise
      assistance everywhere, in village or city block, in such matters
      as -- and I shall take a small example -- public hygiene or the
      distribution of food. How was this done in the old, capitalist
      society? Everybody worked only for himself and nobody cared a
      straw for the aged and the sick, or whether housework was the
      concern only of the women, who, in consequence, were in a
      condition of oppression and servitude. Whose business is it to
      combat this? It is the business of the Youth Leagues, which must
      say: we shall change all this; we shall organise detachments of
      young people who will help to assure public hygiene or
      distribute food, who will conduct systematic house-to-house
      inspections, and work in an organised way for the benefit of the
      whole of society, distributing their forces properly and
      demonstrating that labour must be organised.

    </p>
    <p>The generation of people who are now at the age of fifty cannot
      expect to see a communist society. This generation will be gone
      before then. But the generation of those who are now fifteen
      will see a communist society, and will itself build this
      society. This generation should know that the entire purpose of
      their lives is to build a communist society. In the old society,
      each family worked separtely and labour was not organised by
      anybody except the landowners and capitalists, who oppressed the
      masses of the people. We must organise all labour, no matter how
      toilsome or messy it may be, in such a way that every worker and
      peasant will be able to say: I am part of the great army of free
      labour, and shall be able to build up my life without the
      landowners and capitalists, able to help establish a communist
      system. The Young Communist League should teach all young people
      to engage in conscious and disciplined labour from an early
      age. In this way we can be confident that the problems now
      confronting us will be solved. We must assume that no less than
      ten years will be required for the electrification of the
      country, so that our impoverished land may profit from the
      latest achievements of technology. And so, the generation of
      those who are now fifteen years old, and will be living in a
      communist society in ten or twenty years' time, should tackle
      all its educational tasks in such a way that every day, in every
      village and city, the young people shall engage in the practical
      solution of some problem of labour in common, even though the
      smallest or the simplest. The success of communist construction
      will be assured when this is done in every village, as communist
      emulation develops, and the youth prove that they can unite
      their labour.  Only by regarding our every step from the
      standpoint of the success of that construction, and only by
      asking ourselves whether we have done all we can to be united
      and politically-conscious working people will the Young
      Communist League succeed in uniting its half a million members
      into a single army of labour and win universal respect. (Stormy
      applause.)

      <span class="note"><a href="#2.1">[2]</a></span> Lenin is
      referring to <em>Proletcult</em>, a cultural and educational
      organisation which arose in September 1917 as an independent
      workers' organisation. After the October Revolution Proletcult,
      whose leadership fell into the hands of Bogdanov and his
      supporters, continued to insist on independence, thus setting
      itself in opposition to the proletarian state. This led to the
      infiltration of bourgeois intellectuals, who began to exert a
      decisive influence on Proletcult. Its members actually denied
      the cultural legacy of the past, neglected cultural and
      educational work among the masses, isolated themselves from life
      and aimed at setting up a special "proletarian
      culture". Bogdanov, the chief Proletcult ideologist, paid lip
      service to Marxism, but actually preached subjective idealism,
      Machism. Besides bourgeois intellectuals who held leading
      positions in many organisations, Proletcult also included young
      workers who sincerely wished to promote cultural development in
      the Soviet state. Proletcult organisations had their heyday in
      1919. In the early 1920s they began to decline, ceasing to exist
      in 1932.
