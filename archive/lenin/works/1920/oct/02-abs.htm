    <p>In his 1920 address entitled "The Tasks of the Youth Leagues",
      presented before the Third All-Russia Congress of the Russian
      Young Communist League, Lenin sought to motivate the
      revolutionary youth of Russia to its necessary tasks and
      responsibilities, given the general backwardness of the country
      and the interventionist war being waged by Britain, France, the
      United States and other anti-communist powers, while
      simultaneously capturing the imagination of youth by pointing
      out the non-exploitative nature of communism, the revolution in
      historical development it represented, as well as laying out the
      fundamental tasks of youth organizations, particularly the Young
      Communist League, in a socialist society.

    </p>
    <p>Foremost among the responsibilities of youth, instructed Lenin,
      was to "learn". Specifically, the youth must learn
      communism. And to build a communist society, we must utilize the
      "totality of knowledge" at our disposal. Book knowledge,
      however, without work and struggle, will lead to a complete rift
      with practical life; hence, theory and practice must be
      intertwined and interrelated. Also, knowledge must not be merely
      assimilated, rather, Lenin instructs, "assimilate it
      critically". Cut-and-dried conclusions should not be expounded,
      he cautions, unless they are backed up by "serious and hard
      work" and a critical examination of the facts.

    </p>
    <p>Lenin then expounds upon how communism should be taught and
      what must be taught touching upon the key questions of communist
      ethics, classes and the class struggle, unity between the
      workers and the peasants, and organizing youth for participation
      in the common struggle of all working people against the
      exploiters.

    </p>
    <p>To belong to the Youth League, one must devote one's labour and
      efforts to the common cause. This is the essence of a communist
      education. Only in the course of such work do we become real
      commmunists, and this, Lenin notes, will be indicated by our
      practical results.

    </p>
    <p>"The Young Communist League," Lenin states, "must be a shock
      force, helping in every job and displaying initiative and
      enterprise". Through the League's "practical work and activity"
      any worker will be able to see that the YCL is demonstrating the
      correct road to follow--correct because it leads to the
      liberation of all workers. Emulation of communist methods and
      actions will follow upon the successful solution to practical
      problems by the method of labour in common and as the youth
      prove that they can unite their labour. This is the standpoint
      from which one can judge the success of communist construction.
