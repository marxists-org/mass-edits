    <p class="fst"><span class="cap">I</span>n the first months after
      the proletariat in Russia had won political power (October 25
      [November 7], 1917), it might have seemed that the enormous
      difference between backward Russia and the advanced countries of
      Western Europe would lead to the proletarian revolution in the
      latter countries bearing very little resemblance to ours. We now
      possess quite considerable international experience, which shows
      very definitely that certain fundamental features of our
      revolution have a significance that is not local, or peculiarly
      national, or Russian alone, but international.  I am not
      speaking here of international significance in the broad sense
      of the term: not merely several but all the primary features of
      our revolution, and many of its secondary features, are of
      international significance in the meaning of its effect: on all
      countries. I am speaking of it in the narrowest sense of the
      word, taking international significance to mean the
      international validity or the historical inevitability of a
      repetition, on an international scale, of what has taken place
      in our country. It must be admitted that certain fundamental
      features of our revolution do possess that significance.

    </p>
    <p>It would, of course, be grossly erroneous to exaggerate this
      truth and to extend it beyond certain fundamental features of
      our revolution.  It would also be erroneous to lose sight of the
      fact that, soon after the victory of the proletarian revolution
      in at least one of the advanced countries, a sharp change will
      probably come about: Russia will cease to be the model and will
      once again become a backward country (in the &#8220;Soviet&#8221; and the
      socialist sense).

    </p>
    <p>At the present moment in history, however, it is the Russian
      model that reveals to <em>all</em> countries something&#8212;and
      something highly significant&#8212;of their near and inevitable
      future. Advanced workers in all lands have long realised this;
      more often than not, they have grasped it with their
      revolutionary class instinct rather than realised it. Herein
      lies the international &#8220;significance&#8221; (in the narrow sense of
      the word) of Soviet power, and of the fundamentals of Bolshevik
      theory and tactics.  The &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; leaders of the Second
      International, such as Kautsky in Germany and Otto Bauer and
      Friedrich Adler in Austria, have failed to understand this,
      which is why they have proved to be reactionaries and advocates
      of the worst kind of opportunism and social
      treachery. Incidentally, the anonymous pamphlet entitled <em>The
      World Revolution</em> (<em>Weltrevolution</em>), which appeared in Vienna
      in 1919 (<em>Sozialistische B&#252;cherei</em>, Heft 11; Ignaz
      Brand), very clearly reveals their entire thinking and their
      entire range of ideas, or, rather, the full extent of their
      stupidity, pedantry, baseness and betrayal of working-class
      interests&#8212;and that, moreover, under the guise of &#8220;defending&#8221;
      the idea of &#8220;world revolution&#8221;.

    </p>
    <a name="1.1"></a> 
    <p>We shall, however, deal with this pamphlet
    in greater detail some other time. We shall here note only one
    more point: in bygone days, when he was still a Marxist and not a
    renegade, Kautsky, dealing with the question as an historian,
    foresaw the possibility of a situation arising in which the
    revolutionary spirit of the Russian proletariat would provide a
    model to Western Europe. This was in 1902, when Kautsky wrote an
    article for the revolutionary <em>Iskra</em>, <span
    class="note"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span> entitled &#8220;The Slavs and
    Revolution&#8221;. Here is what he wrote in the article:

    </p>
    <p class="quote">
      &#8220;At the present time [in contrast with 1848] it would seem that
      not only have the Slavs entered the ranks of the revolutionary
      nations, but that the centre of revolutionary thought and
      revolutionary action is shifting more and more to the Slavs. The
      revolutionary centre is shifting from the West to the East. In
      the first half of the nineteenth century it was located in
      France, at times in England. In 1848 Germany too joined the
      ranks of the revolutionary nations. . . . The new century has begun
      with events which suggest the idea that we are approaching a
      further shift of the revolutionary centre, namely, to
      Russia. . . . Russia, which has borrowed so much revolutionary
      initiative from the West, is now perhaps herself ready to serve
      the West as a source of revolutionary energy. The Russian
      revolutionary movement that is now flaring up will perhaps prove
      to be the most potent means of exorcising the spirit of flabby
      philistinism and coldly calculating politics that is beginning
      to spread in our midst, and it may cause the fighting spirit and
      the passionate devotion to our great ideals to flare up again.
      To Western Europe, Russia has long ceased to be a bulwark of
      reaction and absolutism. I think the reverse is true
      today. Western Europe is becoming Russia&#8217;s bulwark of reaction
      and absolutism. . . . The Russian revolutionaries might perhaps
      have coped with the tsar long ago had they not been compelled at
      the same time to fight his ally&#8212;European capital. Let us hope
      that this time they will succeed in coping with both enemies,
      and that the new &#8216;Holy Alliance&#8217; will collapse more rapidly than
      its predecessors did. However the present struggle in Russia may
      end, the blood and suffering of the martyrs whom, unfortunately,
      it will produce in too great numbers, will not have been in
      vain. They will nourish the shoots of social revolution
      throughout the civilised world and make them grow more
      luxuriantly and rapidly. In 1848 the Slavs were a killing frost
      which blighted the flowers of the people&#8217;s spring. Perhaps they
      are now destined to be the storm that will break the ice of
      reaction and irresistibly bring with it a new and happy spring
      for the nations&#8221;

      (Karl Kautsky, &#8220;The Slavs and Revolution&#8221;,
      <em>Iskra</em>, Russian Social-Democratic revolutionary
      newspaper, No. 18,
      March 10, 1902).

      How well Karl Kautsky wrote eighteen years ago!

      <span class="note"><a href="#1.1">[1]</a></span> The old
      <em>Iskra</em>&#8212;the first illegal Marxist newspaper in
      Russia. It was founded by V. I. Lenin in 1900, and played a
      decisive role in the formation of revolutionary Marxist party of
      the working class in Russia. <em>Iskra</em>&#8217;s first issue
      appeared in Leipzig in December 1900, the following issues being
      brought out in Munich, and then beginning with July 1902&#8212;in
      London, and after the spring of 1903&#8212;in Geneva.

    </p>
    <p class="fst">
      On Lenin&#8217;s initiative and with his participation, the editorial
      staff drew up a draft of the Party&#8217;s Programme (published in
      <em>Iskra</em> No. 21), and prepared the Second Congress of the
      R.S.D.L.P., at which the Russian revolutionary Marxist party was
      actually founded.

    </p>
    <p class="fst">
      Soon after the Second Congress, the Mensheviks, supported by
      Plekhanov, won control of <em>Iskra</em>. Beginning with issue
      No. 52, <em>Iskra</em> ceased to be an organ of the
      revolutionary Marxists.
