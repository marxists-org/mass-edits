    <h4>
      I. The Split Among the German Communists
    </h4>

    <p class="fst"><span class="cap">T</span>he split among the
      Communists in Germany is an accomplished fact. The &#8220;Lefts&#8221;, or
      the &#8220;opposition on principle&#8221;, have formed a separate Communist
      Workers&#8217; Party, as distinct from the Communist Party. A split
      also seems imminent in Italy&#8212;I say &#8220;seems&#8221;, as I have only
      two additional issues (Nos. 7 and 8) of the Left newspaper,
      <em>Il Soviet</em>, in which the possibility of and necessity
      for a split is openly discussed, and mention is also made of a
      congress of the &#8220;Abstentionist&#8221; group (or the boycottists, i.e.,
      opponents of participation in parliament), which group is still
      part of the Italian Socialist Party.

    </p>
    <p>There is reason to fear that the split with the &#8220;Lefts&#8221;, the
      anti-parliamentarians (in part anti-politicals too, who are
      opposed to any political party and to work in the trade unions),
      will become an international phenomenon, like the split with the
      &#8220;Centrists&#8221; (i.e., Kautskyites, Longuetists, Independents,
      etc.). Let that be so. At all events, a split is better than
      confusion, which hampers the ideological, theoretical and
      revolutionary growth and maturing of the party, and its
      harmonious, really organised practical work which actually paves
      the way for the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    </p>
    <p>Let the &#8220;Lefts&#8221; put themselves to a practical test on a
      national and international scale. Let them try to prepare for
      (and then implement) the dictatorship of the proletariat,
      without a rigorously centralised party with iron discipline,
      without the ability to become masters of every sphere, every
      branch, and every variety of political and cultural
      work. Practical experience will soon teach them.
    </p>

    <a name="*9.1"></a> 
      <p>Only, every effort should be made to
    prevent the split with the &#8220;Lefts&#8221; from impeding&#8212;or to see
    that it impedes as little as possible&#8212;the necessary
    amalgamation into a single party, inevitable in the near future,
    of all participants in the working-class movement who sincerely
    and conscientiously stand for Soviet government and the
    dictatorship of the proletariat. It was the exceptional good
    fortune of the Bolsheviks in Russia to have had fifteen years for
    a systematic and consummated struggle both against the Mensheviks
    (i.e., the opportunists and &#8220;Centrists&#8221;) and against the &#8220;Lefts&#8221;,
    long before the masses began direct action for the dictatorship of
    the proletariat. In Europe and America the same work has now to be
    done by forced marches, so to say. Certain individuals, especially
    among unsuccessful aspirants to leadership, may (if they lack
    proletarian discipline and are not honest towards themselves)
    persist in their mistakes for a long time; however, when the time
    is ripe, the masses of the workers will themselves unite easily
    and rapidly and unite all sincere Communists to form a single
    party capable of establishing the Soviet system and the
    dictatorship of the proletariat. <span class="note"><a

    <h4>
      II.
      The Communists
      and the Independents in Germany</h4>
    
    <p class="fst"><span class="cap">I</span>n this pamphlet I have
      expressed the opinion that a compromise between the Communists
      and the Left wing of the Independents is necessary and useful to
      communism, but will not be easy to bring about.  Newspapers
      which I have subsequently received have confirmed this opinion
      on both points. No. 32 of <em>The Red Flag</em>, organ of the
      Central Committee, the Communist Party of Germany (<em>Die Rote
      Fahne</em>, Zentralorgan der Kommunistischen Partei
      Deutschlands, Spartakusbund, of March 26, 1920) published a
      &#8220;statement&#8221; by this Central Committee regarding the
      Kapp-L&#252;ttwitz military <em>putsch</em> and on the &#8220;socialist
      government&#8221;. This statement is quite correct both in its basic
      premise and its practical conclusions.  The basic premise is
      that at present there is no &#8220;objective basis&#8221; for the
      dictatorship of the proletariat because the &#8220;majority of the
      urban workers&#8221; support the Independents. The conclusion is: a
      promise to be a &#8220;loyal opposition&#8221; (i.e., renunciation of
      preparations for a &#8220;forcible overthrow&#8221;) to a &#8220;socialist
      government if it excludes bourgeois-capitalist parties&#8221;.

    </p>
    <p>In the main, this tactic is undoubtedly correct. Yet, even if
      minor inaccuracies of formulation should not be dwelt on, it is
      impossible to pass over in silence the fact that a government
      consisting of social-traitors should not (in an official
      statement by the Communist Party) be called &#8220;socialist&#8221;; that
      one should not speak of the exclusion of &#8220;bourgeois-capitalist
      parties&#8221;, when the parties both of the Scheidemanns and of the
      Kautskys and Crispiens are petty-bourgeois-democratic parties;
      that things should never be written that are contained in &#167;4 of
      the statement, which reads:

    </p>
    <p class="quote">
      &#8220;. . . A state of affairs in which political freedom can be enjoyed
      without restriction, and bourgeois democracy cannot operate as
      the dictatorship of capital is, from the viewpoint of the
      development of the proletarian dictatorship, of the utmost
      importance in further winning the proletarian masses over to the
      side of communism.&#8221;

    </p>
    <p>
      Such a state of affairs is impossible. Petty-bourgeois leaders,
      the German Hendersons (Scheidemanns) and Snowdens (Crispiens),
      do not and cannot go beyond the bounds of bourgeois democracy,
      which, in its turn, cannot but be a dictatorship of capital. To
      achieve the practical results that the Central Committee of
      the Communist Party had been quite rightly working for, there
      was no need to write such things, which are wrong in principle
      and politically harmful. It would have been sufficient to say
      (if one wished to observe parliamentary amenities): &#8220;As long as
      the majority of the urban workers follow the Independents, we
      Communists must do nothing to prevent those workers from getting
      rid of their last philistine-democratic (i.e.,
      &#8216;bourgeois-capitalist&#8217;) illusions by going through the
      experience of having a government of their &#8216;own&#8217;.&#8221; That is
      sufficient ground for a compromise, which is really necessary
      and should consist in renouncing, for a certain period, all
      attempts at the forcible overthrow of a government which enjoys
      the confidence of a majority of the urban workers. But in
      everyday mass agitation, in which one is not bound by official
      parliamentary amenities, one might, of course, add: &#8220;Let
      scoundrels like the Scheidemanns, and philistines like the
      Kautskys and Crispiens reveal by their deeds how they have been
      fooled themselves and how they are fooling the workers; their
      &#8216;clean&#8217; government will itself do the &#8216;cleanest&#8217; job of all in
      &#8216;cleansing&#8217; the Augean stables of socialism, Social-Democracy
      and other forms of social treachery.&#8221;
    </p>

      <a name="10"></a> 
	  <p>The real nature of the present leaders
    of the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany (leaders of
    whom it has been wrongly said that they have already lost all
    influence, whereas in reality they are even more dangerous to the
    proletariat that the Hungarian Social-Democrats who styled
    themselves Communists and promised to &#8220;support&#8221; the dictatorship
    of the proletariat) was once again revealed during the German
    equivalent of the Kornilov revolt, i.e., the Kapp-L&#252;ttwitz
    <em>putsch</em>. <span class="note"><a href="#*10">*10</a></span>
    A small but striking illustration is provided by two brief
    articles&#8212;one by Karl Kautsky entitled &#8220;Decisive Hours&#8221;
    (&#8220;Entscheidende Stunden&#8221;) in <em>Freiheit</em> (<em>Freedom</em>),
    organ of the Independents, of March 30, 1920, and the other by
    Arthur Crispien entitled &#8220;On the Political Situation&#8221; (in the same
    newspaper, issue of April 14, 1920). These gentlemen are
    absolutely incapable of thinking and reasoning like
    revolutionaries. They are snivelling philistine democrats, who
    become a thousand times more dangerous to the proletariat when
    they claim to be supporters of Soviet government and of the
    dictatorship of the proletariat because, in fact, whenever a
    difficult and dangerous situation arises they are sure to commit
    treachery . . . while &#8220;sincerely&#8221; believing that they are helping
    the proletariat! Did not the Hungarian Social-Democrats, after
    rechristening themselves Communists, also want to &#8220;help&#8221; the
    proletariat when, because of their cowardice and spinelessness,
    they considered the position of Soviet power in Hungary hopeless
    and went snivelling to the agents of the Entente capitalists and
    the Entente hangmen?

    <h4>
      III. 
      Turati and Co. in Italy
    </h4>


    <p class="fst"><span class="cap">T</span>he issues of the Italian
      newspaper <em>Il Soviet</em> referred to above fully confirm
      what I have said in the pamphlet about the Italian Socialist
      Party&#8217;s error in tolerating such members and even such a group
      of parliamentarians in their ranks. It is still further
      confirmed by an outside observer like the Rome correspondent of
      <em>The Manchester Guardian</em>, organ of the British liberal
      bourgeoisie, whose interview with Turati is published in its
      issue of March 12, 1920. The correspondent writes:

    </p>
    <p class="quote">&#8220;. . . Signor Turati&#8217;s opinion is that the
      revolutionary peril is not such as to cause undue anxiety in
      Italy. The Maximalists are fanning the fire of Soviet theories
      only to keep the masses awake and excited. These theories are,
      however, merely legendary notions, unripe programmes, incapable
      of being put to practical use. They are likely only to maintain
      the working classes in a state of expectation. The very men
      who use them as a lure to dazzle proletarian eyes find
      themselves compelled to fight a daily battle for the extortion
      of some often trifling economic advantages so as to delay the
      moment when the working classes will lose their illusions and
      faith in their cherished myths. Hence a long string of strikes
      of all sizes and with all pretexts up to the very latest ones in
      the mail and railway services&#8212;strikes which make the already
      hard conditions of the country still worse. The country is
      irritated owing to the difficulties connected with its Adriatic
      problem, is weighed down by its foreign debt and by its inflated
      paper circulation, and yet it is still far from realising the
      necessity of adopting that discipline of work which alone can
      restore order and prosperity.&#8221;

    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear as daylight that this British correspondent has
      blurted out the truth, which is probably being concealed and
      glossed over both by Turati himself, and his bourgeois
      defenders, accomplices and inspirers in Italy.  That truth is
      that the ideas and political activities of Turati, Tr&#232;ves,
      Modigliani, Dugoni and Co. are really and precisely of the kind
      that the British correspondent has described. It is downright
      social treachery.  Just look at this advocacy of order and
      discipline among the workers, who are wage-slaves toiling to
      enrich the capitalists! And how familiar to us Russians are all
      these Menshevik speeches! What a valuable admission it is that
      the masses are <em>in favour of</em> Soviet government! How
      stupid and vulgarly bourgeois is the failure to understand the
      revolutionary role of strikes which are spreading spontaneously!
      Indeed, the correspondent of the British bourgeois-liberal
      newspaper has rendered Turati and Co. a disservice and has
      excellently confirmed the correctness of the demand by Comrade
      Bordiga and his friends on <em>Il Soviet</em>, who are insisting
      that the Italian Socialist Party, if it really wants to be
      <em>for</em> the Third International, should drum Turati and
      Co. out of its ranks and become a Communist Party both in name
      and in deed.

    <a name="a4"></a>
    <h4>
      IV. 
      False Conclusions from Correct Premises
    </h4>

    <p class="fst"><span class="cap">H</span>owever, Comrade Bordiga
      and his &#8220;Left&#8221; friends draw from their correct criticism of
      Turati and Co. the wrong conclusion that any participation in
      parliament is harmful in principle. The Italian &#8220;Lefts&#8221; cannot
      advance even a shadow of serious argument in support of this
      view.  They simply do not know (or try to forget) the
      international examples of really revolutionary and communist
      utilisation of bourgeois parliaments, which has been of
      unquestionable value in preparing for the proletarian
      revolution. They simply cannot conceive of any &#8220;new&#8221; ways of
      that utilisation, and keep on repeatedly and endlessly
      vociferating about the &#8220;old&#8221; non-Bolshevik way.

    </p>
    <p>Herein lies their fundamental error. In <em>all</em> fields of
      activity, and not in the parliamentary sphere alone, communism
      must <em>introduce</em> (and without long and persistent effort
      it will be <em>unable</em> to introduce) something new in
      principle that will represent a radical break with the
      traditions of the Second International (while retaining and
      developing what was good in the latter).

    </p>
    <p>Let us take, say, journalistic work. Newspapers, pamphlets and
      leaflets perform the indispensable work of propaganda, agitation
      and organisation.  No mass movement in any country at all
      civilised can get along without a journalistic apparatus. No
      outcries against &#8220;leaders&#8221; or solemn vows to keep the masses
      uncontaminated by the influence of leaders will relieve us of
      the necessity of using, for this work, people from a
      bourgeois-intellectual environment or will rid us of the
      bourgeois-democratic, &#8220;private property&#8221; atmosphere and
      environment in which this work is carried out under capitalism.
      Even two and a half years after the overthrow of the
      bourgeoisie, after the conquest of political power by the
      proletariat, we still have this atmosphere around us, this
      environment of mass (peasant, artisan) bourgeois-democratic
      private property relations.

    </p>
    <p>Parliamentarianism is one form of activity; journalism is
      another.  The content of both can and should be communist if
      those engaged in these two spheres are genuine Communists,
      really members of a proletarian mass party. Yet, in neither
      sphere&#8212;and <em>in no other sphere of activity</em> under
      capitalism and during the period of transition from capitalism
      to socialism&#8212;is it possible to avoid those difficulties which
      the proletariat must overcome, those special problems which the
      proletariat must solve so as to use, for its own purposes, the
      services of people from the ranks of the bourgeoisie, eradicate
      bourgeois-intellectualist prejudices and influences, and weaken
      the resistance of (and, ultimately, completely transform) the
      petty-bourgeois environment.

    </p>
    <p>Did we not, before the war of 1914&ndash;18, witness in all countries
      innumerable cases of extreme &#8220;Left&#8221; anarchists, syndicalists and
      others fulminating against parliamentarianism, deriding
      bourgeois-vulgarised parliamentary socialists, castigating their
      careerism, and so on and so forth, and yet themselves pursuing
      the <em>same kind</em> of bourgeois career <em>through</em>
      journalism and <em>through</em> work in the syndicates (trade
      unions)? Is not the example of Jouhaux and Merrheim, to limit
      oneself to France, typical in this respect?

    </p>
    <p>The childishness of those who &#8220;repudiate&#8221; participation in
      parliament consists in their thinking it possible to
      &#8220;<em>solve</em>&#8221; the difficult problem of combating
      bourgeois-democratic influences <em>within</em> the
      working-class movement in such a &#8220;simple&#8221;, &#8220;easy&#8221;, 
      allegedly revolutionary manner, whereas they are actually merely running
      away from their own shadows, only closing their eyes to
      difficulties and trying to shrug them off with mere words. The
      most shameless careerism, the bourgeois utilisation of
      parliamentary seats, glaringly reformist perversion of
      parliamentary activity, and vulgar petty-bourgeois conservatism
      are all unquestionably common and prevalent features engendered
      everywhere by capitalism, not only outside but also within the
      working-class movement. But the selfsame capitalism and the
      bourgeois environment it creates (which disappears very slowly
      even after the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, since the peasantry
      constantly regenerates the bourgeoisie) give rise to what is
      essentially the same bourgeois careerism, national chauvinism,
      petty-bourgeois vulgarity, etc.&#8212;merely varying
      insignificantly in form&#8212;in positively every sphere of
      activity and life.

    </p>
    <p>You think, my dear boycottists and anti-parliamentarians, that
      you are &#8220;terribly revolutionary&#8221;, but in reality <em>you are
      frightened</em> by the comparatively minor difficulties of the
      struggle against bourgeois influences within the working-class
      movement, whereas your victory&#8212;i.e., the overthrow of the
      bourgeoisie and the conquest of political power by the
      proletariat&#8212;will create <em>these very same</em> difficulties
      on a still larger, an infinitely larger scale. Like children,
      you are frightened by a minor difficulty which confronts you
      today, but you do not understand that tomorrow, and the day
      after, you will still have to learn, and learn thoroughly, to
      overcome the selfsame difficulties, only on an immeasurably
      greater scale.
    </p>

      <a name="40.1"></a> 
<p>Under Soviet rule, your proletarian party
    and ours will be invaded by a still larger number of bourgeois
    intellectuals. They will worm their way into the Soviets, the
    courts, and the administration, since communism cannot be built
    otherwise than with the aid of the human material created by
    capitalism, and the bourgeois intellectuals cannot be expelled and
    destroyed, but must be won over, remoulded, assimilated and
    re-educated, just as we must&#8212;in a protracted struggle waged on
    the basis of the dictatorship of the proletariat&#8212;re-educate the
    proletarians themselves, who do not abandon their petty-bourgeois
    prejudices at one stroke, by a miracle, at the behest of the
    Virgin Mary, at the behest of a slogan, resolution or decree, but
    only in the course of a long and difficult mass struggle against
    mass petty-bourgeois influences. Under Soviet rule, these same
    problems, which the anti-parliamentarians now so proudly, so
    haughtily, so lightly and so childishly brush aside with a wave of
    the hand&#8212;<em>these selfsame</em> problems are arising anew
    <em>within</em> the Soviets, within the Soviet administration
    among the Soviet &#8220;pleaders&#8221; (in Russia we have abolished, and have
    rightly abolished, the bourgeois legal bar, but it is reviving
    again under the cover of the &#8220;Soviet pleaders&#8221; <span
    class="note"><a href="#40">[40]</a></span>&#8217;). Among Soviet
    engineers, Soviet school-teachers and the privileged, i.e., the
    most highly skilled and best situated, <em>workers</em> at Soviet
    factories, we observe a constant revival of absolutely
    <em>all</em> the negative traits peculiar to bourgeois
    parliamentarianism, and we are conquering this evil&#8212;gradually&#8212;only 
    by a tireless, prolonged and persistent struggle based on
    proletarian organisation and discipline.

    </p>
    <p>Of course, under the rule of the bourgeoisie it is very
      &#8220;difficult&#8221; to eradicate bourgeois habits from our own, i.e.,
      the workers&#8217;, party; it is &#8220;difficult&#8221; to expel from the party
      the familiar parliamentary leaders who have been hopelessly
      corrupted by bourgeois prejudices; it is &#8220;difficult&#8221; to subject
      to proletarian discipline the absolutely essential (even if very
      limited) number of people coming from the ranks of the
      bourgeoisie; it is &#8220;difficult&#8221; to form, in a bourgeois
      parliament, a communist group fully worthy of the working class;
      it is &#8220;difficult&#8221; to ensure that the communist parliamentarians
      do not engage in bourgeois parliamentary inanities, but concern
      themselves with the very urgent work of propaganda, agitation
      and organisation among the masses. All this is &#8220;difficult&#8221;, to
      be sure; it was difficult in Russia, and it is vastly more
      difficult in Western Europe and in America, where the
      bourgeoisie is far stronger, where bourgeois-democratic
      traditions are stronger, and so on.

    </p>
    <p>Yet all these &#8220;difficulties&#8221; are mere child&#8217;s play compared
      with the <em>same sort</em> of problems which, in any event, the
      proletariat will have most certainly to solve in order to
      achieve victory, both during the proletarian revolution and
      after the seizure of power by the proletariat.  Compared with
      <em>these</em> truly gigantic problems of re-educating, under
      the proletarian dictatorship, millions of peasants and small
      proprietors, hundreds of thousands of office employees,
      officials and bourgeois intellectuals, of subordinating them all
      to the proletarian state and to proletarian leadership, of
      eradicating their bourgeois habits and traditions&#8212;compared
      with these gigantic problems it is childishly easy to create,
      under the rule of the bourgeoisie, and in a bourgeois
      parliament, a really communist group of a real proletarian
      party.

    </p>
    <p>If our &#8220;Left&#8221; and anti-parliamentarian comrades do not learn to
      overcome even such a small difficulty now, we may safely assert
      that either they will prove incapable of achieving the
      dictatorship of the proletariat, and will be unable to
      subordinate and remould the bourgeois intellectuals and
      bourgeois institutions on a wide scale, or they will have to
      <em>hastily complete their education</em>, and, by that haste,
      will do a great deal of harm to the cause of the proletariat,
      will commit more errors than usual, will manifest more than
      average weakness and inefficiency, and so on and so forth.

    </p>
    <p>Until the bourgeoisie has been overthrown and, after that,
      until small-scale economy and small commodity production have
      entirely disappeared, the bourgeois atmosphere, proprietary
      habits and petty-bourgeois traditions will hamper proletarian
      work both outside and within the working-class movement, not
      only in a single field of activity&#8212;the parliamentary&#8212;but,
      inevitably, in every field of social activity, in all cultural
      and political spheres without exception. The attempt to brush
      aside, to fence oneself off from <em>one</em> of the
      &#8220;unpleasant&#8221; problems or difficulties in some one sphere of
      activity is a profound mistake, which will later most certainly
      have to be paid for. We must learn how to master every sphere of
      work and activity without exception, to overcome all
      difficulties and eradicate all bourgeois habits, customs and
      traditions everywhere. Any other way of presenting the question
      is just trifling, mere childishness.

    <h4>Letter From Wijnkoop</h4>

    <p class="fst">Moscow, June 30, 1920</p>

    <p class="fst">Dear Comrade Lenin,</p>

    <p>Thanks to your kindness, we members of the Dutch delegation to
      the Second Congress of the Communist International were able to
      read your <em>&#8220;Left-Wing&#8221; Communism&#8212;An Infantile Disorder</em>
      prior to its publication in the European languages. In several
      places in the book you emphasise your disapproval of the part
      played by some members of the Communist Party of Holland in
      international politics.

    </p>
    <p>We feel, nevertheless, that we must protest against your laying
      the responsibility for their actions on the Communist
      Party. This is highly inaccurate. Moreover, it is unjust,
      because these members of the Communist Party of Holland take
      little or no part in the Party&#8217;s current activities and are
      endeavouring, directly or indirectly, to give effect, in the
      Communist Party of Holland, to opposition slogans against which
      the Party and all its organs have waged, and continue to wage to
      this day, a most energetic struggle.

    </p>
    <p>
    Fraternally yours,

    </p>

      <span class="note"><a href="#*9.1">[*9]</a></span> With regard
      to the question of future amalgamation of the &#8220;Left&#8221; Communists,
      the anti-parliamentarians, with the Communists in general, I
      would make the following additional remarks.  In the measure in
      which I have been able to familiarise myself with the newspapers
      of the &#8220;Left&#8221; Communists and the Communists in general in
      Germany, I find that the former have the advantage of being
      better able than the latter to carry on agitation among the
      masses. I have repeatedly observed something similar to this in
      the history of the Bolshevik Party, though on a smaller scale,
      in individual local organisations, and not on a national
      scale. For instance, in 1907&ndash;08 the &#8220;Left&#8221; Bolsheviks, on
      certain occasions and in certain places, carried on more
      successful agitation among the masses than we did. This may
      partly have been due to the fact that a revolutionary moment, or
      at a time when revolutionary recollections are still fresh, it
      is easier to approach the masses with tactics of sheer
      negation. This, however, is not an argument to prove the
      correctness of such tactics. At all events, there is not the
      least doubt that a Communist <em>party</em> that wishes to be
      the real vanguard, the advanced detachment, of the revolutionary
      <em>class</em>, of the proletariat&#8212;and which, in addition
      wishes to learn to lead the <em>masses</em>, not only the
      proletarian, but also the <em>non</em>-proletarian masses of working and
      exploited people&#8212;must know how to conduct propaganda, how to
      organise, and how to carry on agitation in a manner most simple
      and comprehensible, most clear and vivid, both to the urban,
      factory masses and to the rural masses.

      Incidentally, this has been dealt with in an exceptionally
      clear, concise, precise and Marxist way in the excellent organ
      of the Austrian Communist Party, <em>The Red Banner</em>, of
      March 28 and 30, 1920. (<em>Die Rote Fahne</em>, Wien, 1920,
      Nos. 266 and 267; L.L.: &#8220;<em>Ein neuer Abschnitt der deutschen
