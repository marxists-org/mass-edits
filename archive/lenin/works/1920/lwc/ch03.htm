      <span class="cap">T</span>he

      approach of a great storm was sensed everywhere. All classes were
      in a state of ferment and preparation. Abroad, the press of the
      political exiles discussed the theoretical aspects of <em>all</em>
      the fundamental problems of the revolution.  Representatives of
      the three main classes, of the three principal political trends&#8212;the 
      liberal-bourgeois, the petty-bourgeois-democratic (concealed
      behind &#8220;social-democratic&#8221; and &#8220;social-revolutionary&#8221; labels <span
	class="note"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span>), and the
      proletarian-revolutionary&#8212;anticipated and prepared the
      impending open class struggle by waging a most bitter struggle on
      issues of programme and tactics. <em>All</em> the issues on which
      the masses waged an armed struggle in 1905&ndash;07 and 1917&#150;20 can (and
      should) be studied, in their embryonic form, in the press of the
      period. Among these three main trends there were, of course, a
      host of intermediate, transitional or half-hearted forms.  It
      would be more correct to say that those political and ideological
      trends which were genuinely of a class nature crystallised in the
      struggle of press organs, parties, factions and groups; the
      classes were forging the requisite political and ideological
      weapons for the impending battles.
    </p>

    <p>
      The years of revolution (1905&ndash;07).
      All classes came out
      into the open. All programmatical and tactical views were tested by the
      action of the masses. In its extent and acuteness, the strike struggle
      had no parallel anywhere in the world. The economic strike developed into
      a political strike, and the latter into insurrection. The relations between
      the proletariat, as the leader, and the vacillating and unstable peasantry,
      as the led, were tested in practice. The Soviet form of organisation came
      into being in the spontaneous development of the struggle. The controversies
      of that period over the significance of the Soviets anticipated the great
      struggle of 1917&ndash;20. The alternation of parliamentary and non-parliamentary
      forms of struggle, of the tactics of boycotting parliament and that of
      participating in parliament, of legal and illegal forms of struggle, and
      likewise their interrelations and connections&#8212;all this was marked by
      an extraordinary wealth of content. As for teaching the fundamentals of
      political science to masses and leaders, to classes and parties alike,
      each month of this period was equivalent to an entire year of &#8220;peaceful&#8221;
      and &#8220;constitutional&#8221; development. Without the &#8220;dress rehearsal&#8221; of 1905,
      the victory of the October Revolution in 1917 would have been impossible.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The years of reaction (1907&ndash;10).
Tsarism was victorious.
All the revolutionary and opposition parties were smashed. Depression, 
demoralisation, splits, discord, defection, and pornography took the place
of politics. There was an ever greater drift towards philosophical idealism;
mysticism became the garb of counter-revolutionary sentiments. At the same
time, however, it was this great defeat that taught the revolutionary parties
and the revolutionary class a real and very useful lesson, a lesson in
historical dialectics, a lesson in an understanding of the political struggle,
and in the art and science of waging that struggle. It is at moments of
need that one learns who one&#8217;s friends are. Defeated armies learn their
lesson.

    </p>
    <p>Victorious tsarism was compelled to speed up the destruction of
the remnants of the pre-bourgeois, patriarchal mode of life in Russia.
The country&#8217;s development along bourgeois lines proceeded apace. Illusions
that stood outside and above class distinctions, illusions concerning the
possibility of avoiding capitalism, were scattered to the winds. The class
struggle manifested itself in a quite new and more distinct way.

    </p>
<p>The revolutionary parties had to complete their education. They
were learning how to attack. Now they had to realise that such knowledge
must be supplemented with the knowledge of how to retreat in good order.
They had to realise&#8212;and it is from bitter experience that the revolutionary
class learns to realise this&#8212;that victory is impossible unless one has
learned how to attack and retreat properly. Of all the defeated opposition
and revolutionary parties, the Bolsheviks effected the most orderly retreat,
with the least loss to their &#8220;army&#8221;, with its core best preserved, with
the least significant splits (in point of depth and incurability), with
the least demoralisation, and in the best condition to resume work on the
broadest scale and in the most correct and energetic manner. The Bolsheviks
achieved this only because they ruthlessly exposed and expelled the revolutionary
phrase-mongers, those who did not wish to understand that one had to retreat,
that one had to know how to retreat, and that one had absolutely to learn
how to work legally in the most reactionary of parliaments, in the most
reactionary of trade unions, co-operative and insurance societies and similar
organisations.
</p>

<p>
      The years of revival (1910&ndash;14).
      At first progress was incredibly
slow, then, following the Lena events of 1912, it became somewhat more
rapid. Overcoming unprecedented difficulties, the Bolsheviks thrust back
the Mensheviks, whose role as bourgeois agents in the working-class movement
was clearly realised by the entire bourgeoisie after 1905, and whom the
bourgeoisie therefore supported in a thousand ways against the Bolsheviks.
But the Bolsheviks would never have succeeded in doing this had they not
followed the correct tactics of combining illegal work with the utilisation
of &#8220;legal opportunities&#8221;, which they made a point of doing. In the elections
to the arch-reactionary Duma, the Bolsheviks won the full support of the
worker curia.
</p>

<a name="3-7"></a>
<p>
      The First Imperialist World War (1914&ndash;17).
Legal parliamentarianism, 
with an extremely reactionary &#8220;parliament&#8221;, rendered most useful service
to the Bolsheviks, the party of the revolutionary proletariat. The Bolshevik
deputies were exiled to Siberia. <span class="note"><a href="#3">[3]</a></span>
All shades of social-imperialism social-chauvinism, social-patriotism,
inconsistent and consistent internationalism, pacifism, and the revolutionary
repudiation of pacifist illusions found full expression in the Russian
&#233;migr&#233; press. The learned fools and the old women of the Second International,
who had arrogantly and contemptuously turned up their noses at the abundance
of &#8220;factions&#8221; in the Russian socialist movement and at the bitter struggle
they were waging among themselves, were unable&#8212;when the war deprived
them of their vaunted &#8220;legality&#8221; in <em>all</em> the advanced countries&#8212;
to organise anything even approximating such a free (illegal) interchange
of views and such a free (illegal) evolution of correct views as the Russian
revolutionaries did in Switzerland and in a number of other countries.
That was why both the avowed social-patriots and the &#8220;Kautskyites&#8221; of all
countries proved to be the worst traitors to the proletariat. One of the
principal reasons why Bolshevism was able to achieve victory in 1917&ndash;20
was that, since the end of 1914, it has been ruthlessly exposing the baseness
and vileness of social-chauvinism and &#8220;Kautskyism&#8221; (to which Longuetism
<span class="note"><a href="#5">[4,5]</a></span>
in France, the views of the Fabians <span class="note"><a href="#6">[6]</a></span>
and the leaders of the Independent Labour Party <span class="note"><a href="#7">[7]</a></span>
in Britain, of Turati in Italy, etc., correspond), the masses later becoming
more and more convinced, from their own experience, of the correctness
of the Bolshevik views.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second revolution in Russia (February to October 1917).
      Tsarism&#8217;s senility and obsoleteness had (with the aid of the blows and
      hardships of a most agonising war) created an incredibly destructive force
      directed against it. Within a few days Russia was transformed into a democratic
      bourgeois republic, freer&#8212;in war conditions&#8212;than any other country
      in the world. The leaders of the opposition and revolutionary parties began
      to set up a government, just as is done in the most &#8220;strictly parliamentary&#8221;
      republics; the fact that a man had been a leader of an opposition party
      in parliament&#8212;even in a most reactionary
      parliament&#8212;<em>facilitated</em>
      his subsequent role in the revolution.
    </p>

<a name="8.1"></a>
<p>In a few weeks the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries thoroughly
assimilated all the methods and manners, the arguments and sophistries
of the European heroes of the Second International, of the ministerialists
<span class="note"><a href="#8">[8]</a></span>
and other opportunist riff-raff. Everything we now read about the Scheidemanns
and Noskes, about Kautsky and Hilferding, Renner and Austerlitz, Otto Bauer
and Fritz Adler, Turati and Longuet, about the Fabians and the leaders
of the Independent Labour Party of Britain&#8212;all this seems to us (and
indeed is) a dreary repetition, a reiteration, of an old and familiar refrain.
We have already witnessed all this in the instance of the Mensheviks. As
history would have it, the opportunists of a backward country became the
forerunners of the opportunists in a number of advanced countries.
    </p>

<a name="9.1"></a>
<p>If the heroes of the Second International have all gone bankrupt
and have disgraced themselves over the question of the significance and
role of the Soviets and Soviet rule; if the leaders of the three very important
parties which have now left the Second International (namely, the German
Independent Social-Democratic Party, <span class="note"><a href="#9">[9]</a></span>
the French Longuetists and the British Independent Labour Party) have disgraced
themselves and become entangled in this question in a most &#8220;telling&#8221; fashion;
if they have all shown themselves slaves to the prejudices of petty-bourgeois
democracy (fully in the spirit of the petty-bourgeois of 1848 who called
themselves &#8220;Social-Democrats&#8221;)&#8212;then we can only say that we have <em>already</em>
witnessed <em>all this</em> in the instance of the Mensheviks. As history
would have it, the Soviets came into being in Russia in 1905; from February
to October 1917 they were turned to a false use by the Mensheviks, who
went bankrupt because of their inability to understand the role and significance
of the Soviets; today the idea of Soviet power has emerged <em>throughout
the world</em> and is spreading among the proletariat of all countries with
extraordinary speed. Like our Mensheviks, the old heroes of the Second
International are <em>everywhere</em> going bankrupt, because they are incapable
of understanding the role and significance of the Soviets. Experience has
proved that, on certain very important questions of the proletarian revolution,
<em>all</em> countries will inevitably have to do what Russia has done.

    </p>
    <p>Despite views that are today often to be met with in Europe and
      America, the Bolsheviks began their victorious struggle against the parliamentary
      and (in fact) bourgeois republic and against the Mensheviks in a very cautious
      manner, and the preparations they made for it were by no means simple.
      At the beginning of the period mentioned, we did <em>not</em> call for the
      overthrow of the government but explained that it was impossible to overthrow
      it <em>without</em> first changing the composition and the temper of the
      Soviets. We did not proclaim a boycott of the bourgeois parliament, the
      Constituent Assembly, but said&#8212;and following the April (1917) Conference
      of our Party began to state officially in the name of the Party&#8212;that
      a bourgeois republic with a Constituent Assembly would be better than a
      bourgeois republic without a Constituent Assembly, but that a &#8220;workers&#8217;
      and peasants&#8217; &#8221; republic, a Soviet republic, would be better than any bourgeois-democratic,
      parliamentary republic. Without such thorough, circumspect and long preparations,
      we could not have achieved victory in October 1917, or have consolidated
      that victory.

The reference is to the Bolshevik
deputies to the Fourth Duma, namely, A. Y. Badayev, M. K. Muranov, G. I.
Petrovsky, F. N. Samoilov and N. R. Shagov. At the Duma&#8217;s session of July
26 (August 8), 1914, at which the representatives of all the bourgeois-landowner
Duma groups approved tsarist Russia&#8217;s entry into the imperialist war, the
Bolshevik Duma group declared a firm protest; they refused to vote for
war credits and launched revolutionary propaganda among the people. In
November 1914 the Bolshevik deputies were arrested, in February 1915 they
were brought to trial, and exiled for life to Turukhansk Territory in Eastern
Siberia. The courageous speeches made by the Bolshevik deputies at their
trial, exposing the autocracy, played an important part in anti-war propaganda
and in revolutionising the toiling masses.

<em>Longuetism</em>&#8212;the Centrist
trend within the French Socialist Party, headed by Jean Longuet. During
the First World War of 1914&ndash;18, the Longuetists conducted a policy of conciliation
with the social-chauvinists. They rejected the revolutionary struggle and
came out for &#8220;defence of country&#8221; in the imperialist war. Lenin called
them petty-bourgeois nationalists. After the victory of the October Socialist
Revolution in Russia, the Longuetists called themselves supporters of the
proletarian dictatorship, but in fact they remained opposed to it. In December
1920 the Longuetists, together with the avowed reformists, broke away from
the Party and joined the so-called Two-and-a-Half International.

<em>Fabians</em>&#8212;members of the Fabian
Society, a British reformist organisation founded in 1884. The membership
consisted, in the main, of bourgeois intellectuals. The Fabians denied
the necessity of the proletariat&#8217;s class struggle and the socialist revolution,
and contended that the transition from capitalism to socialism was possible
only through petty reforms and the gradual reorganisation of society. In
1900 the Fabian Society joined the Labour Party. The Fabians are characterised
by Lenin in &#8220;British Pacifism and British Dislike of Theory&#8221; (see present
edition, Vol. 21, pp. 260&ndash;65) and elsewhere.

The <em>Independent Labour Party of
Britain</em> (I.L.P.)&#8212;a reformist organisation founded in 1893 by leaders
of the &#8220;new trade unions&#8221;, in conditions of a revival of the strike struggle
and the mounting movement for British working-class independence of the
bourgeois parties. The I.L.P. included members of the &#8220;new trade unions&#8221;
and those of a number of the old trade unions, as well as intellectuals
and petty bourgeoisie who were under the influence of the Fabians. The
I.L.P. was headed by James Keir Hardie and Ramsay MacDonald. From its very
inception, the I.L.P. took a bourgeois-reformist stand, laying particular
stress on parliamentary forms of struggle and parliamentary deals with
the Liberals. Lenin wrote of the I.L.P. that &#8220;in reality it is an opportunist
party always dependent on the bourgeoisie&#8221;.

of Waldeck-Rousseau.

<p class="fst">A split took place at the Congress of the Independent Social-Democratic
Party, held in Halle in October 1920, the majority joining the Communist
Party of Germany in December 1920. The Right wing formed a separate party,
retaining the old name of the Independent Social-Democratic Party. In 1922
the &#8220;Independents&#8221; re-joined the German Social-Democratic Party.
