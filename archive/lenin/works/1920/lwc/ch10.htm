    <p class="fst"><span class="cap">T</span>he Russian bourgeois
      revolution of 1905 revealed a highly original turn in world
      history: in one of the most backward capitalist countries, the
      strike movement attained a scope and power unprecedented
      anywhere in the world. In the <em>first month</em> of 1905
      <em>alone</em>, the number of strikers was ten times the
      <em>annual</em> average for the previous decade (1895&ndash;1904);
      from January to October 1905, strikes grew all the time and
      reached enormous proportions. Under the influence of a number of
      unique historical conditions, backward Russia was the first to
      show the world, not only the growth, by leaps and bounds, of the
      independent activity of the oppressed masses in time of
      revolution (this had occurred in all great revolutions), but
      also that the significance of the proletariat is infinitely
      greater than its proportion in the total population; it showed a
      combination of the economic strike and the political strike,
      with the latter developing into an armed uprising, and the birth
      of the Soviets, a new form of mass struggle and mass
      organisation of the classes oppressed by capitalism.

    </p>
    <p>The revolutions of February and October 1917 led to the
      all-round development of the Soviets on a nation-wide scale and
      to their victory in the proletarian socialist revolution. In
      less than two years, the international character of the Soviets,
      the spread of this form of struggle and organisation to the
      world working-class movement and the historical mission of the
      Soviets as the grave-digger, heir and successor of bourgeois
      parliamentarianism and of bourgeois democracy in general, all
      became clear.

    </p>
    <p>But that is not all. The history of the working-class movement
      now shows that, in all countries, it is about to go through (and
      is already going through) a struggle waged by communism&#8212;emergent, 
      gaining strength and advancing towards victory&#8212;against, 
      primarily, Menshevism, i.e., opportunism and
      social-chauvinism (the home brand in each particular country),
      and then as a complement, so to say, Left-wing communism. The
      former struggle has developed in all countries, apparently
      without any exception, as a duel between the Second
      International (already virtually dead) and the Third
      International. The latter struggle is to be seen in Germany,
      Great Britain, Italy, America (at any rate, a certain
      <em>section</em> of the Industrial Workers of the World and of
      the anarcho-syndicalist trends uphold the errors of Left-wing
      communism alongside of an almost universal and almost unreserved
      acceptance of the Soviet system), and in France (the attitude of
      a section of the former syndicalists towards the political party
      and parliamentarianism, also alongside of the acceptance of the
      Soviet system); in other words, the struggle is undoubtedly
      being waged, not only on an international, but even on a
      worldwide scale.

    </p>
    <p>But while the working-class movement is everywhere going
      through what is actually the same kind of preparatory school for
      victory over the bourgeoisie, it is achieving that development
      in its <em>own way</em> in each country. The big and advanced
      capitalist countries are travelling this road <em>far more
      rapidly</em> than did Bolshevism, to which history granted
      fifteen years to prepare itself for victory, as an organised
      political trend. In the brief space of a year, the Third
      International has already scored a decisive victory; it has
      defeated the yellow, social-chauvinist Second International,
      which only a few months ago was incomparably stronger than the
      Third International, seemed stable and powerful, and enjoyed
      every possible support&#8212;direct and indirect, material
      (Cabinet posts, passports, the press) and ideological&#8212;from 
      the world bourgeoisie.

    </p>
    <p>It is now essential that Communists of every country should
      quite consciously take into account both the fundamental
      objectives of the struggle against opportunism and &#8220;Left&#8221;
      doctrinairism, and the <em>concrete features</em> which this
      struggle assumes and must inevitably assume in each country, in
      conformity with the specific character of its economics,
      politics, culture, and national composition (Ireland, etc.), its
      colonies, religious divisions, and so on and so
      forth. Dissatisfaction with the Second International is felt
      everywhere and is spreading and growing, both because of its
      opportunism and because of its inability or incapacity to create
      a really centralised and really leading centre capable of
      directing the international tactics of the revolutionary
      proletariat in its struggle for a world Soviet republic.  It
      should be clearly realised that such a leading centre can never
      be built up on stereotyped, mechanically equated, and identical
      tactical rules of struggle. As long as national and state
      distinctions exist among peoples and countries&#8212;and these
      will continue to exist for a very long time to come, even after
      the dictatorship of the proletariat has been established on a
      world-wide scale&#8212;the unity of the international tactics
      of the communist working-class movement in all countries
      demands, not the elimination of variety or the suppression of
      national distinctions (which is a pipe dream at present), but an
      application of the <em>fundamental</em> principles of communism
      (Soviet power and the dictatorship of the proletariat), which
      will <em>correctly modify</em> these principles in certain
      <em>particulars</em>, correctly adapt and apply them to national
      and national-state distinctions.  To seek out, investigate,
      predict, and grasp that which is nationally specific and
      nationally distinctive, in the <em>concrete manner</em> in which
      each country should tackle a <em>single</em> international task:
      victory over opportunism and Left doctrinairism within the
      working-class movement; the overthrow of the bourgeoisie; the
      establishment of a Soviet republic and a proletarian
      dictatorship&#8212;such is the basic task in the historical
      period that all the advanced countries (and not they alone) are
      going through.  The chief thing&#8212;though, of course, far
      from everything&#8212;the chief thing, has already been
      achieved: the vanguard of the working class has been won over,
      has ranged itself on the side of Soviet government and against
      parliamentarianism, on the side of the dictatorship of the
      proletariat and against bourgeois democracy. All efforts and all
      attention should now be concentrated on the <em>next</em> step,
      which may seem&#8212;and from a certain viewpoint actually is
     &#8212;less fundamental, but, on the other hand, is actually
      closer to a practical accomplishment of the task. That step is:
      the search after forms of the <em>transition</em> or the
      <em>approach</em> to the proletarian revolution.
    </p>

    <a name="37-38"></a>

    <p>The proletarian vanguard has been won over ideologically. That
      is the main thing. Without this, not even the first step towards
      victory can be made. But that is still quite a long way from
      victory. Victory cannot be won with a vanguard alone. To throw
      only the vanguard into the decisive battle, before the entire
      class, the broad masses, have taken up a position either of
      direct support for the vanguard, or at least of sympathetic
      neutrality towards it and of precluded support for the enemy,
      would be, not merely foolish but criminal. Propaganda and
      agitation alone are not enough for an entire class, the broad
      masses of the working people, those oppressed by capital, to
      take up such a stand. For that, the masses must have their own
      political experience. Such is the fundamental law of all great
      revolutions, which has been confirmed with compelling force and
      vividness, not only in Russia but in Germany as well. To turn
      resolutely towards communism, it was necessary, not only for the
      ignorant and often illiterate masses of Russia, but also for the
      literate and well-educated masses of Germany, to realise from
      their own bitter experience the absolute impotence and
      spinelessness, the absolute helplessness and servility to the
      bourgeoisie, and the utter vileness of the government of the
      paladins of the Second International; they had to realise that a
      dictatorship of the extreme reactionaries (Kornilov <span
      class="note"><a href="#37" name="bk37">[37]</a></span> in
      Russia; Kapp <span class="note"><a href="#38" name="bk38">[38]</a></span>
      and Co. in Germany) is inevitably
      the only alternative to a dictatorship of the proletariat.

    </p>
    <p>The immediate objective of the class-conscious vanguard of the
      international working-class movement, i.e., the Communist
      parties, groups and trends, is to be able to <em>lead</em> the
      broad masses (who are still, for the most part, apathetic,
      inert, dormant and convention-ridden) to their new position, or,
      rather, to be able to lead, <em>not only</em> their own party
      but also these masses in their advance and transition to the new
      position. While the first historical objective (that of winning
      over the class-conscious vanguard of the proletariat to the side
      of Soviet power and the dictatorship of the working class) could
      not have been reached without a complete ideological and
      political victory over opportunism and social-chauvinism, the
      second and immediate objective, which consists in being able to
      lead the <em>masses</em> to a new position ensuring the victory
      of the vanguard in the revolution, cannot be reached without the
      liquidation of Left doctrinairism, and without a full
      elimination of its errors.

    </p>
    <p>As long as it was (and inasmuch as it still is) a question of
      winning the proletariat&#8217;s vanguard over to the side of
      communism, priority went and still goes to propaganda work; even
      propaganda circles, with all their parochial limitations, are
      useful under these conditions, and produce good results. But
      when it is a question of practical action by the masses, of the
      disposition, if one may so put it, of vast armies, of the
      alignment of <em>all</em> the class forces in a given society
      <em>for the final and decisive battle</em>, then propagandist
      methods alone, the mere repetition of the truths of &#8220;pure&#8221;
      communism, are of no avail. In these circumstances, one must not
      count in thousands, like the propagandist belonging to a small
      group that has not yet given leadership to the masses; in these
      circumstances one must count in millions and tens of
      millions. In these circumstances, we must ask ourselves, not
      only whether we have convinced the vanguard of the revolutionary
      class, but also whether the historically effective forces of
      <em>all</em> classes&#8212;positively of all the classes in a
      given society, without exception&#8212;are arrayed in such a
      way that the decisive battle is at hand&#8212;in such a way
      that: (1) all the class forces hostile to us have become
      sufficiently entangled, are sufficiently at loggerheads with
      each other, have sufficiently weakened themselves in a struggle
      which is beyond their strength; (2) all the vacillating and
      unstable, intermediate elements&#8212;the petty bourgeoisie and
      the petty-bourgeois democrats, as distinct from the bourgeoisie&#8212;have 
      sufficiently exposed themselves in the eyes of the
      people, have sufficiently disgraced themselves through their
      practical bankruptcy, and (3) among the proletariat, a mass
      sentiment favouring the most determined, bold and dedicated
      revolutionary action against the bourgeoisie has emerged and
      begun to grow vigorously. Then revolution is indeed ripe; then,
      indeed, if we have correctly gauged all the conditions indicated
      and summarised above, and if we have chosen the right moment,
      our victory is assured.

    </p>
    <p>The differences between the Churchills and the Lloyd Georges
     &#8212;with insignificant national distinctions, these political
      types exist in <em>all</em> countries&#8212;on the one hand,
      and between the Hendersons and the Lloyd Georges on the other,
      are quite minor and unimportant from the standpoint of pure
      (i.e., abstract) communism, i.e., communism that has not yet
      matured to the stage of practical political action by the
      masses.  However, from the standpoint of this practical action
      by the masses, these differences are most important. To take due
      account of these differences, and to determine the moment when
      the inevitable conflicts between these &#8220;friends&#8221;, which weaken
      and enfeeble <em>all the </em>&#8220;<em>friends</em>&#8221; <em>taken 
      together</em>, will
      have come to a head&#8212;that is the concern, the task, of a
      Communist who wants to be, not merely a class-conscious and
      convinced propagandist of ideas, but a practical leader of the
      <em>masses</em> in the revolution.  It is necessary to link the
      strictest devotion to the ideas of communism with the ability to
      effect all the necessary practical compromises, tacks,
      conciliatory manoeuvres, zigzags, retreats and so on, in order
      to speed up the achievement and then loss of political power by
      the Hendersons (the heroes of the Second International, if we
      are not to name individual representatives of petty-bourgeois
      democracy who call themselves socialists); to accelerate their
      inevitable bankruptcy in practice, which will enlighten the
      masses in the spirit of our ideas, in the direction of
      communism; to accelerate the inevitable friction, quarrels,
      conflicts and complete disintegration among the Hendersons, the
      Lloyd Georges and the Churchills (the Mensheviks, the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Constitutional-Democrats, the
      monarchists; the Scheidemanns, the bourgeoisie and the Kappists,
      etc.); to select the proper moment when the discord among these
      &#8220;pillars of sacrosanct private property&#8221; is at its height, so
      that, through a decisive offensive, the proletariat will defeat
      them all and capture political power.

    </p>
    <p>History as a whole, and the history of revolutions in
      particular, is always richer in content, more varied, more
      multiform, more lively and ingenious than is imagined by even
      the best parties, the most class-conscious vanguards of the most
      advanced classes. This can readily be understood, because even
      the finest of vanguards express the class-consciousness, will,
      passion and imagination of tens of thousands, whereas at moments
      of great upsurge and the exertion of all human capacities,
      revolutions are made by the class-consciousness, will, passion
      and imagination of tens of millions, spurred on by a most acute
      struggle of classes. Two very important practical conclusions
      follow from this: first, that in order to accomplish its task
      the revolutionary class must be able to master <em>all</em>
      forms or aspects of social activity without exception
      (completing after the capture of political power&#8212;sometimes 
      at great risk and with very great danger&#8212;what
      it did not complete before the capture of power); second, that
      the revolutionary class must be prepared for the most rapid and
      brusque replacement of one form by another.

    </p>
    <p>One will readily agree that any army which does not train to
      use all the weapons, all the means and methods of warfare that
      the enemy possesses, or may possess, is behaving in an unwise or
      even criminal manner. This applies to politics even more than it
      does to the art of war. In politics it is even harder to know in
      advance which methods of struggle will be applicable and to our
      advantage in certain future conditions. Unless we learn to apply
      all the methods of struggle, we may suffer grave and sometimes
      even decisive defeat, if changes beyond our control in the
      position of the other classes bring to the forefront a form of
      activity in which we are especially weak. If, however, we learn
      to use all the methods of struggle, victory will be certain,
      because we represent the interests of the really foremost and
      really revolutionary class, even if circumstances do not permit
      us to make use of weapons that are most dangerous to the enemy,
      weapons that deal the swiftest mortal blows. Inexperienced
      revolutionaries often think that legal methods of struggle are
      opportunist because, in this field, the bourgeoisie has most
      frequently deceived and duped the workers (particularly in
      &#8220;peaceful&#8221; and non-revolutionary times), while illegal methods
      of struggle are revolutionary. That, however, is wrong. The
      truth is that those parties and leaders are opportunists and
      traitors to the working class that are unable or unwilling (do
      not say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8221;; say, &#8220;I shan&#8217;t&#8221;) 
      to use illegal methods of
      struggle in conditions such as those which prevailed, for
      example, during the imperialist war of 1914&ndash;18, when the
      bourgeoisie of the freest democratic countries most brazenly and
      brutally deceived the workers, and smothered the truth about the
      predatory character of the war. But revolutionaries who are
      incapable of combining illegal forms of struggle with
      <em>every</em> form of legal struggle are poor revolutionaries
      indeed. It is not difficult to be a revolutionary when
      revolution has already broken out and is in spate, when all
      people are joining the revolution just because they are carried
      away, because it is the vogue, and sometimes even from careerist
      motives. After its victory, the proletariat has to make most
      strenuous efforts, even the most painful, so as to &#8220;liberate&#8221;
      itself from such pseudo-revolutionaries.  It is far more
      difficult&#8212;and far more precious&#8212;to be a
      revolutionary when the conditions for direct, open, really mass
      and really revolutionary struggle <em>do not yet exist</em>, to
      be able to champion the interests of the revolution (by
      propaganda, agitation and organisation) in non-revolutionary
      bodies, and quite often in downright reactionary bodies, in a
      non-revolutionary situation, among the masses who are incapable
      of immediately appreciating the need for revolutionary methods
      of action. To be able to seek, find and correctly determine the
      specific path or the particular turn of events that will
      <em>lead</em> the masses to the real, decisive and final
      revolutionary struggle&#8212;such is the main objective of
      communism in Western Europe and in America today.
    </p>

    <a name="39.1"></a>

    <p>Britain is an example. We cannot tell&#8212;no one can tell in
      advance&#8212;how soon a real proletarian revolution will flare
      up there, and <em>what immediate cause</em> will most serve to
      rouse, kindle, and impel into the struggle the very wide masses,
      who are still dormant. Hence, it is our duty to carry on all our
      preparatory work in such a way as to be &#8220;well shod on all four
      feet&#8221; (as the late Plekhanov, when he was a Marxist and
      revolutionary, was fond of saying). It is possible that the
      breach will be forced, the ice broken, by a parliamentary
      crisis, or by a crisis arising from colonial and imperialist
      contradictions, which are hopelessly entangled and are becoming
      increasingly painful and acute, or perhaps by some third cause,
      etc. We are not discussing the kind of struggle that will
      <em>determine</em> the fate of the proletarian revolution in
      Great Britain (no Communist has any doubt on that score; for all
      of us this is a foregone conclusion): what we are discussing is
      the <em>immediate cause</em> that will bring into motion the now
      dormant proletarian masses, and lead them right up to
      revolution.  Let us not forget that in the French bourgeois
      republic, for example, in a situation which, from both the
      international and the national viewpoints, was a hundred times
      less revolutionary than it is today, such an &#8220;unexpected&#8221; and
      &#8220;petty&#8221; cause as one of the many thousands of fraudulent
      machinations of the reactionary military caste (the Dreyfus case
      <span class="note"><a href="#39">[39]</a></span>) was enough to
      bring the people to the brink of civil war!

    </p>
    <p>In Great Britain the Communists should constantly,
      unremittingly and unswervingly utilise parliamentary elections
      and all the vicissitudes of the Irish, colonial and
      world-imperialist policy of the British Government, and all
      other fields, spheres and aspects of public life, and work in
      all of them in a new way, in a communist way, in the spirit of
      the Third, not the Second, International. I have neither the
      time nor the space here to describe the &#8220;Russian&#8221; 
      &#8220;Bolshevik&#8221;
      methods of participation in parliamentary elections and in the
      parliamentary struggle; I can, however, assure foreign
      Communists that they were quite unlike the usual West-European
      parliamentary campaigns. From this the conclusion is often
      drawn: &#8220;Well, that was in Russia, in our country
      parliamentarianism is different.&#8221; This is a false
      conclusion. Communists, adherents of the Third International in
      all countries, exist for the purpose of <em>changing</em> &#8212;
      all along the line, in all spheres of life&#8212;the old
      socialist, trade unionist, syndicalist, and parliamentary type
      of work into a <em>new</em> type of work, the communist.  In
      Russia, too, there was always an abundance of opportunism,
      purely bourgeois sharp practices and capitalist rigging in the
      elections. In Western Europe and in America, the Communist must
      learn to create a new, uncustomary, non-opportunist, and
      non-careerist parliamentarianism; the Communist parties must
      issue their slogans; true proletarians, with the help of the
      unorganised and downtrodden poor, should distribute leaflets,
      canvass workers&#8217; houses and cottages of the rural proletarians
      and peasants in the remote villages (fortunately there are many
      times fewer remote villages in Europe than in Russia, and in
      Britain the number is very small); they should go into the
      public houses, penetrate into unions, societies and chance
      gatherings of the common people, and speak to the people, not in
      learned (or very parliamentary) language, they should not at all
      strive to &#8220;get seats&#8221; in parliament, but should everywhere try
      to get people to think, and draw the masses into the struggle,
      to take the bourgeoisie at its word and utilise the machinery it
      has set up, the elections it has appointed, and the appeals it
      has made to the people; they should try to explain to the people
      what Bolshevism is, in a way that was never possible (under
      bourgeois rule) outside of election times (exclusive, of course,
      of times of big strikes, when in Russia a <em>similar</em>
      apparatus for widespread popular agitation worked even more
      intensively). It is very difficult to do this in Western Europe
      and extremely difficult in America, but it can and must be done,
      for the objectives of communism cannot be achieved without
      effort. We must work to accomplish <em>practical</em> tasks,
      ever more varied and ever more closely connected with all
      branches of social life, winning branch after branch, and sphere
      after sphere <em>from the bourgeoisie</em>.

    </p>
    <p>In Great Britain, further, the work of propaganda, agitation
      and organisation among the armed forces and among the oppressed
      and underprivileged nationalities in their &#8220;own&#8221; state (Ireland,
      the colonies) must also be tackled in a new fashion (one that is
      not socialist, but communist; not reformist, but
      revolutionary). That is because, in the era of imperialism in
      general and especially today after a war that was a sore trial
      to the peoples and has quickly opened their eyes to the truth
      (i.e., the fact that tens of millions were killed and maimed for
      the sole purpose of deciding whether the British or the German
      robbers should plunder the largest number of countries), all
      these spheres of social life are heavily charged with
      inflammable material and are creating numerous causes of
      conflicts, crises and an intensification of the class
      struggle. We do not and cannot know which spark&#8212;of the
      innumerable sparks that are flying about in all countries as a
      result of the world economic and political crisis&#8212;will
      kindle the conflagration, in the sense of raising up the masses;
      we must, therefore, with our new and communist principles, set
      to work to stir up all and sundry, even the oldest, mustiest and
      seemingly hopeless spheres, for otherwise we shall not be able
      to cope with our tasks, shall not be comprehensively prepared,
      shall not be in possession of all the weapons and shall not
      prepare ourselves either to gain victory over the bourgeoisie
      (which arranged all aspects of social life&#8212;and has now
      disarranged them&#8212;in its bourgeois fashion), or to bring
      about the impending communist reorganisation of every sphere of
      life, following that victory.

    </p>
    <p>Since the proletarian revolution in Russia and its victories on
      an international scale, expected neither by the bourgeoisie nor
      the philistines, the entire world has become different, and the
      bourgeoisie everywhere has become different too. It is terrified
      of &#8220;Bolshevism&#8221;, exasperated by it almost to the point of
      frenzy, and for that very reason it is, on the one hand,
      precipitating the progress of events and, on the other,
      concentrating on the forcible suppression of Bolshevism, thereby
      weakening its own position in a number of other fields. In their
      tactics the Communists in all the advanced countries must take
      both these circumstances into account.

    </p>
    <p>When the Russian Cadets and Kerensky began furiously to hound
      the Bolsheviks&#8212;especially since April 1917, and more
      particularly in June and July 1917&#8212;they overdid
      things. Millions of copies of bourgeois papers, clamouring in
      every key against the Bolsheviks, helped the masses to make an
      appraisal of Bolshevism; apart from the newspapers, all public
      life was full of discussions about Bolshevism, as a result of
      the bourgeoisie&#8217;s &#8220;zeal&#8221;. Today the millionaires of all
      countries are behaving on an international scale in a way that
      deserves our heartiest thanks. They are hounding Bolshevism with
      the same zeal as Kerensky and Co. did; they, too, are overdoing
      things and <em>helping</em> us just as Kerensky did. When the
      French bourgeoisie makes Bolshevism the central issue in the
      elections, and accuses the comparatively moderate or vacillating
      socialists of being Bolsheviks; when the American bourgeoisie,
      which has completely lost its head, seizes thousands and
      thousands of people on suspicion of Bolshevism, creates an
      atmosphere of panic, and broadcasts stories of Bolshevik plots;
      when, despite all its wisdom and experience, the British
      bourgeoisie&#8212;the most &#8220;solid&#8221; in the world&#8212;makes
      incredible blunders, founds richly endowed &#8220;anti-Bolshevik
      societies&#8221;, creates a special literature on Bolshevism, and
      recruits an extra number of scientists, agitators and clergymen
      to combat it, we must salute and thank the capitalists. They are
      working for us. They are helping us to get the masses interested
      in the essence and significance of Bolshevism, and they cannot
      do otherwise, for they have <em>already</em> failed to ignore
      Bolshevism and stifle it.

    </p> 
   <p>But at the same time, the bourgeoisie sees practically only one
      aspect of Bolshevism&#8212;insurrection, violence, and terror;
      it therefore strives to prepare itself for resistance and
      opposition primarily in <em>this</em> field. It is possible
      that, in certain instances, in certain countries, and for
      certain brief periods, it will succeed in this. We must reckon
      with such an eventuality, and we have absolutely nothing to fear
      if it does succeed. Communism is emerging in positively every
      sphere of public life; its beginnings are to be seen literally
      on all sides. The &#8220;contagion&#8221; (to use the favourite metaphor of
      the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois police, the one mostly to
      their liking) has very thoroughly penetrated the organism and
      has completely permeated it. If special efforts are made to
      block one of the channels, the &#8220;contagion&#8221; will find another
      one, sometimes very unexpectedly. Life will assert itself. Let
      the bourgeoisie rave, work itself into a frenzy, go to extremes,
      commit follies, take vengeance on the Bolsheviks in advance, and
      endeavour to kill off (as in India, Hungary, Germany, etc.)
      more hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands of
      yesterday&#8217;s and tomorrow&#8217;s Bolsheviks. In acting thus, the
      bourgeoisie is acting as all historically doomed classes have
      done. Communists should know that, in any case, the future
      belongs to them; therefore, we can (and must) combine the most
      intense passion in the great revolutionary struggle, with the
      coolest and most sober appraisal of the frenzied ravings of the
      bourgeoisie.  The Russian revolution was cruelly defeated in
      1905; the Russian Bolsheviks were defeated in July 1917; over
      15,000 German Communists were killed as a result of the wily
      provocation and cunning manoeuvres of Scheidemann and Noske, who
      were working hand in glove with the bourgeoisie and the
      monarchist generals; White terror is raging in Finland and
      Hungary. But in all cases in all countries, communism is
      becoming steeled and is growing; its roots are so deep that
      persecution does not weaken or debilitate it but only
      strengthens it. Only one thing is lacking to enable us to march
      forward more confidently and firmly to victory, namely, the
      universal and thorough awareness of all Communists in all
      countries of the necessity to display the utmost
      <em>flexibility</em> in their tactics. The communist movement,
      which is developing magnificently, now lacks, especially in the
      advanced countries, this awareness and the ability to apply it
      in practice.

    </p>
    <p>That which happened to such leaders of the Second
      International, such highly erudite Marxists devoted to socialism
      as Kautsky, Otto Bauer and others, could (and should) provide a
      useful lesson. They fully appreciated the need for flexible
      tactics; they themselves learned Marxist dialectic and taught it
      to others (and much of what they have done in this field will
      always remain a valuable contribution to socialist literature);
      however, <em>in the application</em> of this dialectic they
      committed such an error, or proved to be so <em>un</em>dialectical in
      practice, so incapable of taking into account the rapid change
      of forms and the rapid acquisition of new content by the old
      forms, that their fate is not much more enviable than that of
      Hyndman, Guesde and Plekhanov. The principal reason for their
      bankruptcy was that they were hypnotised by a definite form of
      growth of the working-class movement and socialism, forgot all
      about the one-sidedness of that form, were afraid to see the
      break-up which objective conditions made inevitable, and
      continued to repeat simple and, at first glance, incontestable
      axioms that had been learned by rote, like: &#8220;three is more than
      two&#8221;. But politics is more like algebra than like arithmetic, 
      and still more like higher than
      elementary mathematics. In reality, all the old forms of the
      socialist movement have acquired a new content, and,
      consequently, a new symbol, the &#8220;minus&#8221; sign, has appeared in
      front of all the figures; our wiseacres, however, have
      stubbornly continued (and still continue) to persuade themselves
      and others that &#8220;minus three&#8221; is more than &#8220;minus two&#8221;.

    </p>
    <p>We must see to it that Communists do not make a similar
      mistake, only in the opposite sense, or rather, we must see to
      it that a <em>similar mistake</em>, only made in the opposite
      sense by the &#8220;Left&#8221; Communists, is corrected as soon as possible
      and eliminated as rapidly and painlessly as possible. It is not
      only Right doctrinairism that is erroneous; Left doctrinairism
      is erroneous too. Of course, the mistake of Left doctrinairism
      in communism is at present a thousand times less dangerous and
      less significant than that of Right doctrinairism (i.e.,
      social-chauvinism and Kautskyism); but, after all, that is only
      due to the fact that Left communism is a very young trend, is
      only just coming into being. It is only for this reason that,
      under certain conditions, the disease can be easily eradicated,
      and we must set to work with the utmost energy to eradicate it.

    </p>
    <p>The old forms burst asunder, for it turned out that their new
      content&#8212;anti-proletarian and reactionary&#8212;had
      attained an inordinate development. From the standpoint of the
      development of international communism, our work today has such
      a durable and powerful content (for Soviet power and the
      dictatorship of the proletariat) that it can <em>and must</em> manifest
      itself in any form, both new and old; it can and must
      regenerate, conquer and subjugate all forms, not only the new,
      but also the old&#8212;not for the purpose of reconciling
      itself with the old, but for the purpose of making all and every
      form&#8212;new and old&#8212;a weapon for the complete and
      irrevocable victory of communism.

    </p>
    <p>The Communists must exert every effort to direct the
      working-class movement and social development in general along
      the straightest and shortest road to the victory of Soviet power
      and the dictatorship of the proletariat on a world-wide
      scale. That is an incontestable truth. But it is enough to take
      one little step farther&#8212;a step that might seem to be in
      the same direction&#8212;and truth turns into error. We have
      only to say, as the German and British Left Communists do, that
      we recognise only one road, only the direct road, and that we
      will not permit tacking, conciliatory manoeuvres, or
      compromising&#8212;and it will be a mistake which may cause,
      and in part has already caused and is causing, very grave
      prejudices to communism. Right doctrinairism persisted in
      recognising only the old forms, and became utterly bankrupt, for
      it did not notice the new content. Left doctrinairism persists
      in the unconditional repudiation of certain old forms, failing
      to see that the new content is forcing its way through all and
      sundry forms, that it is our duty as Communists to master all
      forms, to learn how, with the maximum rapidity, to supplement one
      form with another, to substitute one for another, and to adapt
      our tactics to any such change that does not come from our class
      or from our efforts.

    </p>
    <p>World revolution has been so powerfully stimulated and
      accelerated by the horrors, vileness and abominations of the
      world imperialist war and by the hopelessness of the situation
      created by it, this revolution is developing in scope and depth
      with such splendid rapidity, with such a wonderful variety of
      changing forms, with such an instructive practical refutation of
      all doctrinairism, that there is every reason to hope for a
      rapid and complete recovery of the international communist
      movement from the infantile disorder of &#8220;Left-wing&#8221; communism.

      <span class="note"><a href="#bk37">[37]</a></span> This refers
      to the counter-revolutionary mutiny organised in August 1917 by
      the bourgeoisie and the landowners, under the Supreme
      Commander-in-Chief, the tsarist general Kornilov. The
      conspirators hoped to seize Petrograd, smash the Bolshevik
      Party, break up the Soviets, establish a military dictatorship
      in the country, and prepare the restoration of the monarchy.

    </p>
    <p class="fst">The mutiny began on August 25 (September 7),
      Kornilov sending the 3rd Cavalry Corps against Petrograd, where
      Kornilov counter-revolutionary organisations were ready to act.

    </p>
    <p class="fst">The Kornilov mutiny was crushed by the workers and
      peasants led by the Bolshevik Party. Under pressure from the
      masses, the Provisional Government was forced to order that
      Kornilov and his accomplices be arrested and brought to trial.

      is to the military-monarchist coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, the so-called Kapp
      <em>putsch</em> organised by the German reactionary
      militarists. It was headed by the monarchist landowner Kapp and
      Generals Ludendorff, Seeckt and L&#252;ttwitz. The conspirators
      prepared the coup with the connivance of the Social-Democratic
      government. On March 13, 1920, the mutinous generals moved
      troops against Berlin and, meeting with no resistance from the
      government, proclaimed a military dictatorship. The German
      workers replied with a general strike. Under pressure from the
      proletariat the Kapp government was overthrown on March 17, and
      the Social-Democrats again took power.

      <span class="note"><a href="#39.1">[39]</a></span> The
      <em>Dreyfus case</em>&#8212;a provocative trial organised in 1894
      by the reactionary-monarchist circles of the French
      militarists. On trial was Dreyfus, a Jewish officer of the
      French General Staff, falsely accused of espionage and high
      treason. Dreyfus&#8217;s conviction&#8212;he was condemned to life
      imprisonment&#8212;was used by the French reactionaries to rouse
      anti-Semitism and to attack the republican regime and democratic
      liberties. When, in 1898, socialists and progressive bourgeois
      democrats such as Emile Zola, Jean Jaur&#232;s, and Anatole France
      launched a campaign for Dreyfus&#8217;s re-trial, the case became a
      major political issue and split the country into two
      camps&#8212;the republicans and democrats on the one hand, and a
      bloc of monarchists, clericals, anti-Semites and nationalists,
      on the other. Under the pressure of public opinion, Dreyfus was
      released in 1899, and in 1906 was acquitted by the Court of
      Cassation and reinstated in the Army.
