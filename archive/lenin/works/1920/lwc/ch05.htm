      <span class="cap">T</span>he German Communists we must now speak
      of call themselves, not &#8220;Left-wingers&#8221; but, if I am not
      mistaken, an &#8220;opposition on principle&#8221;.  <span class="note"><a
      href="#17">[17]</a></span> From what follows below it will,
      however, be seen that they reveal all the symptoms of the
      &#8220;infantile disorder of Leftism&#8221;.
    </p>

    <p>Published by the &#8220;local group in Frankfurt am Main&#8221;, a pamphlet
      reflecting the point of view of this opposition, and entitled
      <em>The Split in the Communist Party of Germany</em> (<em>The Spartacus
      League</em>) sets forth the substance of this opposition&#8217;s
      views most saliently, and with the utmost clarity and
      concision. A few quotations will suffice to acquaint the reader
      with that substance:

    </p>
    <p class="quote">&#8220;The Communist Party is the party of the most determined class struggle. . . .&#8221;

    </p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;. . . Politically, the transitional period [between capitalism
and socialism] is one of the proletarian dictatorship. . . .&#8221;

    </p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;. . . The question arises: who is to exercise this dictatorship:
<em>the Communist Party or the proletarian class</em>? . . . <em>Fundamentally</em>,
should we strive for a dictatorship of the Communist Party, or for a dictatorship
of the proletarian class? . . .&#8221;

    </p>
<p class="fst">
(All italics as in the orginal)

    </p>
    <p>
The author of the pamphlet goes on to accuse the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of Germany of seeking ways of achieving a <em>coalition
with the Independent Social</em>-<em>Democratic Party of Germany</em>, and
of raising &#8220;<em>the question of recognising</em>, <em>in principle</em>, <em>all
political means</em>&#8221; of struggle, including parliamentarianism, with the
sole purpose of concealing its actual and main efforts to form a coalition
with the Independents. The pamphlet goes on to say:

    </p>
    <p class="quote">&#8220;The opposition have chosen another road. They are of the opinion that
the question of the rule of the Communist Party and of the dictatorship
of the Party is merely one of tactics. In any case, rule by the Communist
Party is the ultimate form of any party rule. <em>Fundamentally</em>, we
must work for the dictatorship of the proletarian class. And all the measures
of the Party, its organisations, methods of struggle, strategy and tactics
should be directed to that end. Accordingly, all compromise with other
parties, all reversion to parliamentary forms of struggle which have become
historically and politically obsolete, and any policy of manoeuvring and
compromise must be emphatically rejected.&#8221; &#8220;Specifically proletarian methods
of revolutionary struggle must be strongly emphasised. New forms of organisation
must be created on the widest basis and with the widest scope in order
to enlist the most extensive proletarian circles and strata to take part
in the revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party.
A <em>Workers&#8217; Union</em>, based on factory organisations, should be the
rallying point for all revolutionary elements. This should unite all workers
who follow the slogan: &#8216;Get out of the trade unions!&#8217; It is here that the
militant proletariat musters its ranks for battle. Recognition of the class
struggle, of the Soviet system and of the dictatorship should be sufficient
for enrolment. All subsequent political education of the fighting masses
and their political orientation in the struggle are the task of the Communist
Party, which stands outside the Workers&#8217; Union. . . .

    </p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;. . . Consequently, two Communist parties are now arrayed against
each other:

    </p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;<em>One is a party of leaders</em>, which is out to organise the
revolutionary struggle and to direct it from <em>above</em>, accepting compromises
and parliamentarianism so as to create a situation enabling it to join
a coalition government exercising a dictatorship.

    </p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;<em>The other is a mass party</em>, which expects an upsurge of
the revolutionary struggle from <em>below</em>, which knows and applies a
single method in this struggle&#8212;a method which clearly leads to the goal&#8212;and 
rejects all parliamentary and opportunist methods. That single method
is the unconditional <em>overthrow of the bourgeoisie</em>, so as then to
set up the proletarian class dictatorship for the accomplishment of socialism. . . .

    </p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;. . . There&#8212;the dictatorship of leaders; here&#8212;the dictatorship
of the masses! That is our slogan.&#8221;

    </p>
    <p>
Such are the main features characterising the views of the opposition in
the German Communist Party.

    </p>
    <p>Any Bolshevik who has consciously participated in the development
of Bolshevism since 1903 or has closely observed that development will
at once say, after reading these arguments, &#8220;What old and familiar rubbish!
What &#8216;Left-wing&#8217; childishness!&#8221;

    </p>
    <p>But let us examine these arguments a little more closely.

    </p>
    <p>The mere presentation of the question&#8212;&#8220;dictatorship of the
party <em>or</em> dictatorship of the class; dictatorship (party) of the
leaders, <em>or</em> dictatorship (party) of the masses?&#8221;&#8212;testifies to
most incredibly and hopelessly muddled thinking. These people want to <em>invent</em>
something quite out of the ordinary, and, in their effort to be clever,
make themselves ridiculous. It is common knowledge that the masses are
divided into classes, that the masses can be contrasted with classes only
by contrasting the vast majority in general, regardless of division according
to status in the social system of production, with categories holding a
definite status in the social system of production; that as a rule and
in most cases&#8212;at least in present-day civilised countries&#8212;classes
are led by political parties; that political parties, as a general rule,
are run by more or less stable groups composed of the most authoritative,
influential and experienced members, who are elected to the most responsible
positions, and are called leaders. All this is elementary. All this is
clear and simple. Why replace this with some kind of rigmarole, some new
Volap&#252;k? On the one hand, these people seem to have got muddled when they
found themselves in a predicament, when the party&#8217;s abrupt transition from
legality to illegality upset the customary, normal and simple relations
between leaders, parties and classes. In Germany, as in other European
countries, people had become too accustomed to legality, to the free and
proper election of &#8220;leaders&#8221; at regular party congresses, to the convenient
method of testing the class composition of parties through parliamentary
elections, mass meetings the press, the sentiments of the trade unions
and other associations, etc. When, instead of this customary procedure,
it became necessary, because of the stormy development of the revolution
and the development of the civil war, to go over rapidly from legality
to illegality, to combine the two, and to adopt the &#8220;inconvenient&#8221; and
&#8220;undemocratic&#8221; methods of selecting, or forming, or preserving &#8220;groups
of leaders&#8221;&#8212;people lost their bearings and began to think up some unmitigated
nonsense. Certain members of the Communist Party of Holland, who were unlucky
enough to be born in a small country with traditions and conditions of
highly privileged and highly stable legality, and who had never seen a
transition from legality to illegality, probably fell into confusion, lost
their heads, and helped create these absurd inventions.

    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, one can see simply a thoughtless and incoherent
use of the now &#8220;fashionable&#8221; terms: &#8220;masses&#8221; and &#8220;leaders&#8221;. These people have heard and memorised a great many attacks on &#8220;leaders&#8221;, in which the
latter have been contrasted with the &#8220;masses&#8221;; however, they have proved
unable to think matters out and gain a clear understanding of what it was
all about.

    </p>
    <p>The divergence between &#8220;leaders&#8221; and &#8220;masses&#8221; 
was brought out
with particular clarity and sharpness in all countries at the end of the
imperialist war and following it. The principal reason for this was explained
many times by Marx and Engels between the years 1852 and 1892, from the
example of Britain. That country&#8217;s exclusive position led to the emergence,
from the &#8220;masses&#8221;, of a semi&ndash;petty-bourgeois, opportunist &#8220;labour aristocracy&#8221;.
The leaders of this labour aristocracy were constantly going over to the
bourgeoisie, and were directly or indirectly on its pay roll. Marx earned
the honour of incurring the hatred of these disreputable persons by openly
branding them as traitors. Present-day (twentieth-century) imperialism
has given a few advanced countries an exceptionally privileged position,
which, everywhere in the Second International, has produced a certain type
of traitor, opportunist, and social-chauvinist leaders, who champion the
interests of their own craft, their own section of the labour aristocracy.
The opportunist parties have become separated from the &#8220;masses&#8221;, i.e.,
from the broadest strata of the working people, their majority, the lowest-paid
workers. The revolutionary proletariat cannot be victorious unless this
evil is combated, unless the opportunist, social-traitor leaders are exposed,
discredited and expelled. That is the policy the Third International has
embarked on.
    </p>

    <a name="18.1"></a>
    <p>To go so far, in this connection, as to contrast, <em>in general</em>,
the dictatorship of the masses with a dictatorship of the leaders is ridiculously
absurd, and stupid. What is particularly amusing is that, in fact, instead
of the old leaders, who hold generally accepted views on simple matters,
<em>new leaders</em> are brought forth (under cover of the slogan &#8220;Down with
the leaders!&#8221;), who talk rank stuff and nonsense. Such are Laufenberg,
Wolffheim, Horner <span class="note"><a href="#18">[18]</a></span>,
Karl Schroder, Friedrich Wendel and Karl Erler, <span class="note"><a href="#f2" name="b2">*2</a></span>
in Germany. Erler&#8217;s attempts to give the question more &#8220;profundity&#8221; and
to proclaim that in general political parties are unnecessary and &#8220;bourgeois&#8221;
are so supremely absurd that one can only shrug one&#8217;s shoulders. It all
goes to drive home the truth that a minor error can always assume monstrous
proportions if it is persisted in, if profound justifications are sought
for it, and if it is carried to its logical conclusion.

    </p>
    <p>Repudiation of the Party principle and of Party discipline&#8212;that 
is what the opposition has <em>arrived at</em>. And this is tantamount
to completely disarming the proletariat in <em>the interests of the bourgeoisie</em>.
It all adds up to that petty-bourgeois diffuseness and instability, that
incapacity for sustained effort, unity and organised action, which, if
encouraged, must inevitably destroy any proletarian revolutionary movement.
From the standpoint of communism, repudiation of the Party principle means
attempting to leap from the eve of capitalism&#8217;s collapse (in Germany),
not to the lower or the intermediate phase of communism, but to the higher.
We in Russia (in the third year since the overthrow of the bourgeoisie)
are making the first steps in the transition from capitalism to socialism
or the lower stage of communism. Classes still remain, and will remain
everywhere <em>for years after</em> the proletariat&#8217;s conquest of power.
Perhaps in Britain, where there is no peasantry (but where petty proprietors
exist), this period may be shorter. The abolition of classes means, not
merely ousting the landowners and the capitalists&#8212;that is something
we accomplished with comparative ease; it also means <em>abolishing the
small commodity producers</em>, and they <em>cannot be ousted</em>, or crushed;
we <em>must learn to live</em> with them. They can (and must) be transformed
and re-educated only by means of very prolonged, slow, and cautious organisational
work. They surround the proletariat on every side with a petty-bourgeois
atmosphere, which permeates and corrupts the proletariat, and constantly
causes among the proletariat relapses into petty-bourgeois spinelessness,
disunity, individualism, and alternating moods of exaltation and dejection.
The strictest centralisation and discipline are required within the political
party of the proletariat in order to counteract this, in order that the
<em>organisational</em> role of the proletariat (and that is its <em>principal</em>
role) may be exercised correctly, successfully and victoriously. The dictatorship
of the proletariat means a persistent struggle&#8212;bloody and bloodless,
violent and peaceful, military and economic, educational and administrative&#8212;against 
the forces and traditions of the old society. The force of habit
in millions and tens of millions is a most formidable force. Without a
party of iron that has been tempered in the struggle, a party enjoying
the confidence of all honest people in the class in question, a party capable
of watching and influencing the mood of the masses, such a struggle cannot
be waged successfully. It is a thousand times easier to vanquish the centralised
big bourgeoisie than to &#8220;vanquish&#8221; the millions upon millions of petty
proprietors; however, through their ordinary, everyday, imperceptible,
elusive and demoralising activities, they produce the <em>very</em> results
which the bourgeoisie need and which tend to <em>restore</em> the bourgeoisie.
Whoever brings about even the slightest weakening of the iron discipline
of the party of the proletariat (especially during its dictatorship), is
actually aiding the bourgeoisie against the proletariat.

<a name="20-21"></a>
<p>Parallel with the question of the leaders&#8212;the party&#8212;the
class&#8212;the masses, we must pose the question of the &#8220;reactionary&#8221; trade
unions. But first I shall take the liberty of making a few concluding remarks
based on the experience of our Party. There <em>have always been</em> attacks
on the &#8220;dictatorship of leaders&#8221; in our Party. The first time I heard such
attacks, I recall, was in 1895, when, officially, no party yet existed,
but a central group was taking shape in St. Petersburg, which was to assume
the leadership of the district groups. <span class="note"><a href="#20">[20]</a></span>
At the Ninth Congress of our Party (April 1920) <span class="note"><a href="#21">[21]</a></span>,
there was a small opposition, which also spoke against the &#8220;dictatorship
of leaders&#8221;, against the &#8220;oligarchy&#8221;, and so on. There is therefore nothing
surprising, new, or terrible in the &#8220;infantile disorder&#8221; of &#8220;Left-wing
communism&#8221; among the Germans. The ailment involves no danger, and after
it the organism even becomes more robust. In our case, on the other hand,
the rapid alternation of legal and illegal work, which made it necessary
to keep the general staff&#8212;the leaders&#8212;under cover and cloak them
in the greatest secrecy, sometimes gave rise to extremely dangerous consequences.
The worst of these was that in 1912 the <em>agent provocateur</em> Malinovsky
got into the Bolshevik Central Committee. He betrayed scores and scores
of the best and most loyal comrades, caused them to be sentenced to penal
servitude, and hastened the death of many of them. That he did not cause
still greater harm was due to the correct balance between legal and illegal
work. As member of the Party&#8217;s Central Committee and Duma deputy, Malinovsky
was forced, in order to gain our confidence, to help us establish legal
daily papers, which even under tsarism were able to wage a struggle against
the Menshevik opportunism and to spread the fundamentals of Bolshevism
in a suitably disguised form. While, with one hand, Malinovsky sent scores
and scores of the finest Bolsheviks to penal servitude and death, he was
obliged, with the other, to assist in the education of scores and scores
of thousands of new Bolsheviks through the medium of the legal press. Those
German (and also British, American, French and Italian) comrades who are
faced with the task of learning how to conduct revolutionary work within
the reactionary trade unions would do well to give serious thought to this
fact. <span class="note"><a name="b3" href="#f3">*3</a></span>

    </p>
    <p>In many countries, including the most advanced, the bourgeoisie
      are undoubtedly sending <em>agents provocateurs</em> into the Communist parties
      and will continue to do so. A skilful combining of illegal and legal work
      is one of the ways to combat this danger.

The &#8220;<em>opposition on principle</em>&#8221;&#8212;a group of German 
Left-wing Communists advocating anarcho-syndicalist
views. When the Second Congress of the Communist Party of Germany, which
was held in Heidelberg in October 1919, expelled the opposition, the latter
formed the so-called Communist Workers&#8217; Party of Germany, in April 1920.
To facilitate the unification of all German communist forces and win over
the finest proletarian. elements in the C.W.P.G., the opposition was temporarily
admitted into the Communist International in November 1920 with the rights
of a sympathising member.

    </p>
	<p class="fst">However, the Executive Committee of the Communist International
still considered the United Communist Party of Germany to be the only authoritative
section of the Comintern. C.W.P.G.&#8217;s representatives were admitted into
the Comintern on the condition that they merged with the United Communist
Party of Germany and supported all its activities. The C.W.P.G. leaders,
however, failed to observe these conditions. The Third Congress of the
Communist International, which was held in June&ndash;July 1921, and wanted solidarity
with workers who still followed the C.W.P.G. leaders, resolved to give
the C.W.P.G. two months to call a congress and settle the question of affiliation.
The C.W.P.G. Leaders did not obey the Third Congress&#8217;s resolution and thus
placed themselves outside the Communist International. Later the C.W.P.G.
degenerated into a small sectarian group without any support in the working
class.

The reference is to the <em>League
of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class</em> organised by
V. I. Lenin in the autumn of 1895. The League of Struggle united about
twenty Marxist circles in St. Petersburg. It was headed by the Central
Group including V. I. Lenin, A. A. Vaneyev, P. K. Zaporozhets, G. M. Krzhizhanovsky,
N. K. Krupskaya, L. Martov, M. A. Silvin, V. V. Starkov, and others; five
members headed by V. I. Lenin directed the League&#8217;s activities. The organisation
was divided into district groups. Progressive workers such as I. V. Babushkin,
V. A. Shelgunov and others linked these groups with the factories.

    </p>
<p class="fst">The St. Petersburg League of Struggle for the Emancipation of
the Working Class was, in V. I. Lenin&#8217;s words, the embryo of a revolutionary
party based on the working-class movement and giving leadership to the
class struggle of the proletariat.

The Congress was held in Moscow
from March 29 to April 5, 1920. The Ninth Congress was more numerous than
any previous Party congresses. It was attended by 715 delegates&#8212;553
of them with full votes, and 162 with deliberative votes&#8212;representing
a membership of 611,978. Represented were the Party organisations of Central
Russia, the Ukraine, the Urals, Siberia and other regions recently liberated
by the Red Army. Many of the delegates came to the Congress straight from
the front.

    </p>
<p class="fst">The agenda of the Congress was as follows:

    </p>
<p class="quoteb">
1. The report of the Central Committee.

<br />2. The immediate tasks of economic construction.

<br />3. The trade union movement.

<br />4. Organisational questions.

<br />5. The tasks of the Communist International.

<br />6. The attitude towards the co-operatives.

<br />7. The change-over to the militia system.

<br />8. Elections to the Central Committee.

<br />9. Miscellaneous.
</p>

<p class="fst">
The Congress was held under the guidance of V. I. Lenin, who was the main
speaker on the political work of the Central Committee and replied to the
debate on the report. He also spoke on economic construction and co-operation,
made the speech at the closing of the Congress, and submitted a proposal
on the list of candidates to the Party&#8217;s Central Committee.

    </p>
<p class="fst">In the resolution &#8220;The Immediate Tasks of Economic Development&#8221;
the Congress noted that &#8220;the basic condition of economic rehabilitation
of the country is a steady implementation of the single economic plan for
the coming historical epoch&#8221; (<em>KPSS v rezolutsiyakh i resheniyakh syezdov</em>,
<em>konferentsii i plenumov TsK</em> [<em>The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions
and Decisions of Its Congresses</em>, <em>Conferences and Plenums of the
Central Committee</em>], Part I, 1954, p. 478). The kingpin of the single
economic plan was electrification, which V. I. Lenin considered a great
programme for a period of 10 to 20 years. The directives of the Ninth Congress
were the basis of the plan conclusively drawn up by the State Commission
for the Electrification of Russia (the GOELRO plan) and approved by the
All-Russia Congress of Soviets in December 1920.

    </p>
<p class="fst">The Congress paid particular attention to the organisation of
industrial management. The resolution on this question called for the establishment
of competent, firm and energetic one-man management. Taking its guidance
from Lenin, the Congress especially stressed the necessity to extensively
enlist old and experienced experts.

    </p>
<p class="fst">The anti-Party group of Democratic Centralists, consisting of
Sapronov, Osinsky, V. Smirnov and others, came out against the Party line.
Behind a cover of phrases about Democratic Centralism but in fact distorting
that principle, they denied the need for one-man management at factories,
came out against strict Party and state discipline, and alleged that the
Central Committee did not give effect to the principle of collective leadership.

    </p>
<p class="fst">The group of Democratic Centralists was supported at the Congress
by Rykov, Tomsky, Milyutin and Lomov. The Congress rebuffed the Democratic
Centralists and rejected their proposals.

    </p>
<p class="fst">The Congress gave special attention to labour emulation and communist
<em>Subbotniks</em>. To stimulate such emulation, the extensive application
of the bonus system of wages was recommended. The Congress resolved that
May 1, the international proletarian holiday, which in 1920 fell on Saturday,
should be a mass <em>Subbotnik</em> organised throughout Russia.

    </p>
<p class="fst">An important place in the work of the Congress was held by the
question of trade unions, which was considered from the viewpoint of adapting
the entire work of the trade unions to the accomplishment of the economic
tasks. In a resolution on this question, the Congress distinctly defined
the trade unions&#8217; role, their relations with the state and the Party, forms
and methods of guidance of trade unions by the Communist Party, as well
as forms of their participation in communist construction. The Congress
decisively rebuffed the anarcho-syndicalist elements (Shlyapnikov, Lozovsky,
Tomsky and Lutovinov), who advocated the &#8220;independence&#8221; of the trade unions
and contraposed them to the Communist Party and the Soviet government.

    </p>
<p class="fst">At a closed meeting held on April 4, the Congress elected a new
Central Committee of 19 members and 12 candidate members. The former included
V.I. Lenin, A. A. Andreyev, F. E. Dzerzhinsky, M. I. Kalinin, Y. E. Rudzutak,
F. A. Sergeyev (Artyom), and J. V. Stalin. On April 5 the Congress concluded
its work.

The more muddle-headed of the syndicalists and anarchists in the Latin
countries may derive &#8220;satisfaction&#8221; from the fact that solid Germans, who
evidently consider themselves Marxists (by their articles in the above-mentioned
paper K. Erler and K. Horner have shown most plainly that they consider
themselves sound Marxists, but talk incredible nonsense in a most ridiculous
manner and reveal their failure to understand the ABC of Marxism), go to
the length of making utterly inept statements. Mere acceptance of Marxism
does not save one from errors. We Russians know this especially well, because
Marxism has been very often the &#8220;fashion&#8221; in our country.

Malinovsky was a prisoner of war in
Germany. On his return to Russia when the Bolsheviks were in power he was
instantly put on trial and shot by our workers. The Mensheviks attacked
us most bitterly for our mistake&#8212;the fact that an <em>agent provocateur</em>
had become a member of the Central Committee of our Party. But when, under
Kerensky, we demanded the arrest and trial of Rodzyanko, the Chairman of
the Duma, because he had known, even before the war, that Malinovsky was
an <em>agent provocateur</em> and <em>had not informed</em> the Trudoviks and
the workers in the Duma, neither the Mensheviks nor the Socialist-Revolutionaries
in the Kerensky government supported our demand, and Rodzyanko remained
at large and made off unhindered to join Denikin.
