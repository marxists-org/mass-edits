      With this now-classic work, Lenin aimed to encapsulate the
      lessons the Bolshevik Party had learned from its involvement in
      three revolutions in 12 years&#8212;in a manner that European
      Communists could relate to, for it was to them he was
      speaking. He also further develops the theory of what the
      &#8220;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8221; means and stresses that the
      primary danger for the working-class movement in general is
      opportunism on the one hand, and anti-Marxist ultraleftism on
      the other.

      <em>&#8220;Left-Wing&#8221; Communism: an Infantile Disorder</em> was
      written in April, and the appendix was written on May 12,
      1920. It came out on June 8&ndash;10 in Russian and in July was
      published in German, English and French. Lenin gave personal
      attention to the book&#8217;s type-setting and printing schedule so
      that it would be published before the opening of the Second
      Congress of the Communist International, each delegate receiving
      a copy. Between July and November 1920, the book was
      republished in Leipzig, Paris, and London, in the German, French,
      and English languages respectively.

      <em>&#8220;Left-Wing&#8221; Communism: an Infantile Disorder</em> is
      published according to the first edition print, the proofs of
      which were read by Lenin himself.
