    <p class="fst">The last speaker tried to intimidate us by asserting that we
    are heading towards an abyss, towards certain destruction. There is,
    however, nothing new for us in this intimidation. <em>Novaya Zhizn,</em>
    the newspaper that expresses the views of the group to which the speaker
    belongs, said before the October days that our revolution wou!d bring
    nothing but disorders and anarchic riots. Talk about our travelling the
    wrong road is, therefore, a reflection of bourgeois psychology that even
    disinterested people cannot get rid of. <em>(Voice from among the
    internalionalists:</em> Demagogy!") No, that is not demagogy, it is your
    constant talk of the axe that is real demagogy.</p>

    <p>The measures proposed in the decree are only an effective way of
    ensuring control.</p>

    <p>You speak of the intricacy of the machinery, of its fragility and of the
    involved nature of the problem&#8212;these are elementary truths that
    everybody is aware of. But if these truths are merely used to put a brake
    on all socialist undertakings, we say that anyone who takes that line is a
    demagogue, and a dangerous demagogue at that.</p>

    <p>We want to begin an inventory of the vaults, but the learned specialists
    tell us there is nothing in them but documents and securities. Then what is
    there bad about representatives of the people checking them?</p>

    <p>If what they say is true, why do those same learned specialists who
    criticise us not come out with it openly? Whenever the Council makes
    decisions they declare that they agree with us, but only in principle. This
    is the way of the bourgeois intelligentsia, of all conciliators, who ruin
    everything with their constant agreement in principle and disagreement in
    practice.</p>

    <p>If you know so much about all these things and have the experience, why
    don't you help us. why do we meet with nothing but sabotage from you in our
    difficult task?</p>

    <p>You proceed from a correct scientific theory, but for us theory forms
    the basis of actions to be undertaken, it gives us confidence in those
    actions and does not scare the life out of us. Of course it is difficult to
    make a beginning and we often come up against fragile things; nevertheless
    we have coped with them, are coping with them and shall continue to cope
    with them.</p>

    <p>If book-learning were to serve no other purpose than that of hampering
    every new step and instilling eternal fear of the new, it would be
    useless.</p>

    <p>Nobody, with the exception of the utopian socialists, has ever asserted
    that victory is possible without resistance, without the dictatorship of
    the proletariat and without seizing the old world in an iron grip.</p>

    <p>You accepted this dictatorship in principle, but when that word is
    translated into Russian, called an &#8220;iron grip &#8221; and applied in
    practice, you warn us of the fragility and involved nature of the
    matter.</p>

    <p>You stubbornly refuse to see that the iron hand that destroys also
    creates. It is an undoubted advantage to us to go over from principles to
    deeds.</p>

    <p>To effect control we have called upon the bankers and together with them
    have elaborated measures that they agreed to, so that loans could be
    obtained under full control and properly accounted for. But there are
    people among the bank employees who have the interests of the people at
    heart and who have told us:&#8220;They are deceiving you, make haste and
    check their criminal activity that is directly harmful to you&#8220; And we
    did make haste.</p>

    <p>We realise that this is an involved measure. None of us, even those who
    are trained economists, will undertake to carry it out. We shall invite the
    specialists who are engaged in that work, but only when we have the keys in
    our own hands. Then we shall even be able to draw advisers from the former
    millionaires. We invite anybody who wants to work as long as he does not
    try to reduce every revolutionary enterprise to mere words; that is
    something we shall not stand for. We use the words "dictatorship of the
    proletariat" in all seriousness and we shall effect that dictatorship.</p>

    <p>We wanted to take the line or agreement with the banks, we gave them
    loans to finance factories, but they carried out sabotage on an
    unprecedented scale, and practical experience has forced us to adopt other
    measures of control.</p>

    <p>A comrade from the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries has said that in
    principle they would vote for the immediate nationalisation of the banks
    and afterwards work out practical measures in the shortest possible time.
    But he was wrong in that, because our draft does not contain anything but
    principles. The Supreme Economic Council is waiting to discuss them, but if
    the decree is not approved the banks will immediately do everything to
    further disrupt the economy.</p>

    <p>The adoption of the decree is urgent, otherwise opposition and sabotage
    will ruin us. <em>(Stormy applause.)</em></p>

    name="n1">[1]</a></sup> Delivered to the All-Russia Central Executive
    Committee on December 14 (27), 1917, in connection with a discussion of the
    decree nationalising the banks.</p>

    <p class="fst">Work on practical measures for the nationalisation of the
    banks was started as soon as the socialist revolution won out. The State
    Bank was seized on October 25 (November 7), 1917. Having overcome the
    sabotage of the bourgeois officials, Soviet power soon established
    practical control of the State Bank and set up control over private banks
    as a transitional measure to their nationalisation. However, because of
    sabotage by the bankers, the Soviet Government speeded up the
    nationalisation of private banks. On the morning of December 14 (27), the
    Government ordered workers' detachments and fled Guard units to seize
    all banks and credit institutions in Petrograd. That same day, the
    All-Russia Central Executive Committee adopted decrees &#8220;On the
    Nationalisation of the Banks&#8221; and &#8220;On the Inspection of Steel
    Safes in Banks&#8221;.</p>

    <p>Both decrees were published in <em>Izvestia</em> No. 252 on December15
    (28).</p>
