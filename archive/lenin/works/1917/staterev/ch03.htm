      1. What Made the Communards' Attempt Heroic?
    </h4>

    <p>
      It is well known that in the autumn of 1870, a few months before
      the Commune, Marx warned the Paris workers that any attempt to
      overthrow the government would be the folly of despair.  But
      when, in March 1871, a decisive battle was forced upon the
      workers and they accepted it, when the uprising had become a
      fact, Marx greeted the proletarian revolution with the greatest
      enthusiasm, in spite of unfavorable auguries.  Marx did not
      persist in the pedantic attitude of condemning an &#8220;untimely&#8221;
      movement as did the ill-famed Russian renegade from marxism,
      Plekhanov, who in November 1905 wrote encouragingly about the
      workers' and peasants' struggle, but after December 1905 cried,
      liberal fashion: "They should not have taken up arms."
    </p>

    <p>
      Marx, however, was not only enthusiastic about the heroism of
      the Communards, who, as he expressed it, "stormed heaven".
      Although the mass revolutionary movement did not achieve its
      aim, he regarded it as a historic experience of enormous
      importance, as a certain advance of the world proletarian
      revolution, as a practical step that was more important than
      hundreds of programmes and arguments.  Marx endeavored to
      analyze this experiment, to draw tactical lessons from it and
      re-examine his theory in the light of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only &#8220;correction&#8221; Marx thought it necessary to make to the
      <a href="../../../../marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm">Communist
      Manifesto</a> he made on the basis of the revolutionary
      experience of the Paris Commune. 
    </p>

<p>
      The <a
	     href="../../../../marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/preface.htm#1872">last
	     preface</a> to the new German edition of the
	     <em>Communist Manifesto</em>, signed by both its authors,
	     is dated June 24, 1872.  In this preface the authors,
	     Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, say that the programme of
	     the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> "has in some details
	     become out-of-date", and the go on to say:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "... One thing especially was proved by the Commune, viz., that
      'the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state
      machinery and wield it for its own 

      purposes'...."<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw01" name="bk01">[1]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      The authors took the words that are in single quotation marks in this
      passage from Marx's book, <em>The Civil War in France</em>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, Marx and Engels regarded one principal and fundamental lesson of
      the Paris Commune as being of such enormous importance that they
      introduced it as an important correction into the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Most characteristically, it is this important correction that has been
      distorted by the opportunists, and its meaning probably is not known
      to nine-tenths, if not ninety-nine-hundredths, of the readers of the
      <em>Communist Manifesto</em>.  We shall deal with this distortion more
      fully farther on, in a chapter devoted specially to distortions.  Here
      it will be sufficient to note that the current, vulgar
      &#8220;interpretation&#8221; of Marx's famous statement just quoted is that Marx
      here allegedly emphasizes the idea of slow development in
      contradistinction to the seizure of power, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a matter of fact, the exact opposite is the case.  Marx's idea is
      that the working class must break up, smash the "ready-made state
      machinery", and not confine itself merely to laying hold of it. 
    </p>

    <p>
      On April 12, 1871, i.e., just at the time of the Commune, <a href="../../../../marx/works/1871/letters/71_04_12.htm">Marx wrote
      to
	
	Kugelmann</a>:

    <p class="quote">

      will find that I declare that the next attempt of the French
      Revolution will be no longer, as before, to transfer the
      bureaucratic-military machine from one hand to another, but to
      <em>smash</em> it [Marx's italics--the original is <em>zerbrechen</em>], and
      this is the precondition for every real people's revolution on the
      Continent.  And this is what our heroic Party comrades in Paris are
      attempting."

      (<em>Neue Zeit</em>, Vol.XX, 1, 1901-02, p. 

      709.)<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw02" name="bk02">[2]</a></sup>

      <br /> (The letters of Marx to Kugelmann have appeared in
      Russian in no less than two editions, one of which
      I edited and supplied with a preface.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The words, "to smash the bureaucratic-military machine", briefly
      express the principal lesson of Marxism regarding the tasks of
      the proletariat during a revolution in relation to the state.
      And this is the lesson that has been not only completely
      ignored, but positively distorted by the prevailing, Kautskyite,
      &#8220;interpretation&#8221; of Marxism!
    </p>

    <p>
      As for Marx's reference to <em>The Eighteenth Brumaire</em>, we
      have quoted the relevant passage in full above.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is interesting to note, in particular, two points in the
      above-quoted argument of Marx.  First, he restricts his
      conclusion to the Continent.  This was understandable in 1871,
      when Britain was still the model of a purely capitalist country,
      but without a militarist clique and, to a considerable degree,
      without a bureaucracy.  Marx therefore excluded Britain, where a
      revolution, even a people's revolution, then seemed possible,
      and indeed was possible, <em>without</em> the precondition of
      destroying "ready-made state machinery".
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, in 1917, at the time of the first great imperialist war,
      this restriction made by Marx is no longer valid.  Both Britain
      and America, the biggest and the last representatives &#8212; in
      the whole world &#8212; of Anglo-Saxon &#8220;liberty&#8221;, in the sense
      that they had no militarist cliques and bureaucracy, have
      completely sunk into the all-European filthy, bloody morass of
      bureaucratic-military institutions which subordinate everything
      to themselves, and suppress everything.  Today, in Britain and
      America, too, "the precondition for every real people's
      revolution" is the <em>smashing</em>, the <em>destruction</em>
      of the "ready-made state machinery" (made and brought up to the
      &#8220;European&#8221;, general imperialist, perfection in those countries
      in the years 1914-17).
    </p>

    <p>
      Secondly, particular attention should be paid to Marx's
      extremely profound remark that the destruction of the
      bureaucratic-military state machine is "the precondition for
      every real <em>people's</em> revolution".  This idea of a
      "people's revolution seems strange coming from Marx, so that the
      Russian Plekhanovites and Mensheviks, those followers of Struve
      who wish to be regarded as Marxists, might possibly declare such
      an expression to be a "slip of the pen" on Marx's part.  They
      have reduced Marxism to such a state of wretchedly liberal
      distortion that nothing exists for them beyond the antithesis
      between bourgeois revolution and proletarian revolution, and
      even this antithesis they interpret in an utterly lifeless way.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we take the revolutions of the 20th century as examples we
      shall, of course, have to admit that the Portuguese and the
      Turkish revolutions are both bourgeois revolutions.  Neither of
      them, however, is a "people's" revolution, since in neither does
      the mass of the people, their vast majority, come out actively,
      independently, with their own economic and political demands to
      any noticeable degree.  By contrast, although the Russian
      bourgeois revolution of 1905-07 displayed no such &#8220;brilliant&#8221;
      successes as at time fell to the Portuguese and Turkish
      revolutions, it was undoubtedly a "real people's" revolution,
      since the mass of the

      people, their majority, the very lowest social groups, crushed
      by oppression and exploitation, rose independently and stamped
      on the entire course of the revolution the imprint of
      <em>their</em> own demands, <em>their</em> attempt to build in
      their own way a new society in place of the old society that was
      being destroyed.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Europe, in 1871, the proletariat did not constitute the
      majority of the people in any country on the Continent.  A
      "people's" revolution, one actually sweeping the majority into
      its stream, could be such only if it embraced both the
      proletariat and the peasants.  These two classes then
      constituted the &#8220;people&#8221;.  These two classes are united by the
      fact that the "bureaucratic-military state machine" oppresses,
      crushes, exploits them.  To <em>smash</em> this machine, <em>to
      break it up</em>, is truly in the interest of the &#8220;people&#8221;, of
      their majority, of the workers and most of the peasants, is "the
      precondition" for a free alliance of the poor peasant and the
      proletarians, whereas without such an alliance democracy is
      unstable and socialist transformation is impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
      As is well known, the Paris Commune was actually working its way toward
      such an alliance, although it did not reach its goal owing to a number
      of circumstances, internal and external. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Consequently, in speaking of a "real people's revolution", Marx,
      without in the least discounting the special features of the
      petty bourgeois (he spoke a great deal about them and often),
      took strict account of the actual balance of class forces in
      most of the continental countries of Europe in 1871.  On the
      other hand, he stated that the &#8220;smashing&#8221; of the state machine
      was required by the interests of both the workers and the
      peasants, that it united them, that it placed before them the
      common task of removing the &#8220;parasite&#8221; and of replacing it by
      something new.
    </p>

    <p>
      By what exactly?
    </p>



    <h4>

      2. What is to Replace the Smashed State Machine?
    </h4>

    <p>
      In 1847, in the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>, Marx's answer to
      this question was as yet a purely abstract one; to be exact, it
      was an answer that indicated the tasks, but not the ways of
      accomplishing them.  The answer given in the <em>Communist
      Manifesto</em> was that this machine was to be replaced by "the
      proletariat organized as the ruling class", by the "winning of
      the battle of democracy".
    </p>

    <p>
      Marx did not indulge in utopias; he expected the
      <em>experience</em> of the mass movement to provide the reply to
      the question as to the specific forms this organisation of the
      proletariat as the ruling class would assume and as to the exact
      manner in which this organisation would be combined with the
      most complete, most consistent "winning of the battle of
      democracy."
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marx subjected the experience of the Commune, meagre as it was,
      to the most careful analysis in <a href="../../../../marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm">The
      Civil War in France</a>.  Let us quote the most important
      passages of this work. <span class="inote">[All the following
      quotes in this Chapter, with one exception, are so citied -
      Ed.]</span>
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      Originating from the Middle Ages, there developed in the 19th
      century "the centralized state power, with its ubiquitous organs
      of standing army, police, bureaucracy, clergy, and judicature."
      With the development of class antagonisms between capital and
      labor, "state power assumed more and more the character of a
      public force organized for the suppression of the working class,
      of a machine of class rule.  After every revolution, which marks
      an advance in the class struggle, the purely coercive character
      of the state power stands out in bolder and bolder relief."
      After the revolution of 1848-49, state power became "the
      national war instruments of capital against labor".  The Second
      Empire consolidated this.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "The direct antithesis to the empire was the Commune." It was the
      "specific form" of "a republic that was not only to remove the
      monarchical form of class rule, but class rule itself."
    </p>

    <p>
      What was this &#8220;specific&#8221; form of the proletarian, socialist republic?
      What was the state it began to create?
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "The first decree of the Commune, therefore, was the suppression of
      the standing army, and the substitution for it of the armed
      people."
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This demand now figures in the programme of every party calling
      itself socialist.  The real worth of their programme, however,
      is best shown by the behavior of our Social-Revolutionists and
      mensheviks, who, right after the revolution of February 27,
      refused to carry out this demand!
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "The Commune was formed of the municipal councillors, chosen by
      universal suffrage in the various wards of the town, responsible
      and revocable at any time.  The majority of its members were
      naturally working men, or acknowledged representatives of the
      working class.... The police, which until then had been the
      instrument of the Government, was at once stripped of its
      political attributes, and turned into the responsible, and at
      all times revocable, agent of the Commune.  So were the
      officials of all other branches of the administration.  From the
      members of the Commune downwards, the public service had to be
      done at <em>workmen's wages</em>.  The privileges and the
      representation allowances of the high dignitaries of state
      disappeared along with the high dignitaries
      themselves.... Having once got rid of the standing army and the
      police, the instruments of physical force of the old government,
      the Commune proceeded at once to break the instrument of
      spiritual suppression, the power of the priests....  The
      judicial functionaries lost that sham independence...  they were
      thenceforward to be elective, responsible, and 

      revocable."<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw03" name="bk03">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      The Commune, therefore, appears to have replaced the smashed
      state machine &#8220;only&#8221; by fuller democracy: abolition of the
      standing army; all officials to be elected and subject to
      recall.  But as a matter of fact this &#8220;only&#8221; signifies a
      gigantic replacement of certain institutions by other
      institutions of a fundamentally different type.  This is exactly
      a case of "quantity being transformed into quality": democracy,
      introduced as fully and consistently as is at all conceivable,
      is transformed from bourgeois into proletarian democracy; from
      the state (= a special force for the suppression of a particular
      class) into something which is no longer the state proper.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is still necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and crush
      their resistance.  This was particularly necessary for the
      Commune; and one of the reasons for its defeat was that it did
      not do this with sufficient determination.  The organ of
      suppression, however, is here the majority of the population,
      and not a minority, as was always the case under slavery,
      serfdom, and wage slavery.  And since the majority of people
      itself suppresses its oppressors, a 'special force" for
      suppression is no longer necessary! In this sense, the state
      begins to wither away.  Instead of the special institutions of a
      privileged minority (privileged officialdom, the chiefs of the
      standing army), the majority itself can directly fulfil all
      these functions, and the more the functions of state power are
      performed by the people as a whole, the less need there is for
      the existence of this power.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this connection, the following measures of the Commune,
      emphasized by Marx, are particularly noteworthy: the abolition
      of all representation allowances, and of all monetary privileges
      to officials, the reduction of the remuneration of all servants
      of the state to the level of "workmen's wages".  This shows more
      clearly than anything else the turn from bourgeois to
      proletarian democracy, from the democracy of the oppressors to
      that of the oppressed classes, from the state as a "special
      force" for the suppression of a particular class to the
      suppression of the oppressors by the general force of the
      majority of the people--the workers and the peasants.  And it
      is on this particularly striking point, perhaps the most
      important as far as the problem of the state is concerned, that
      the ideas of Marx have been most completely ignored! In popular
      commentaries, the number of which is legion, this is not
      mentioned.  The thing done is to keep silent about it as if it
      were a piece of old-fashioned &#8220;naivete&#8221;, just as Christians,
      after their religion had been given the status of state
      religion, &#8220;forgot&#8221; the &#8220;naivete&#8221; of primitive Christianity with
      its democratic revolutionary spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reduction of the remuneration of high state officials seem
      &#8220;simply&#8221; a demand of naive, primitive democracy.  One of the
      &#8220;founders&#8221; of modern opportunism, the ex-Social-Democrat Eduard
      Bernstein, has more than once repeated the vulgar bourgeois
      jeers at &#8220;primitive&#8221; democracy.  Like all opportunists, and like
      the present Kautskyites, he did not understand at all that,
      first of all, the transition from capitalism to socialism is
      impossible without a certain &#8220;reversion&#8221; to &#8220;primitive&#8221;
      democracy (for how else can the majority, and then the whole
      population without exception, proceed to discharge state
      functions?); and that, secondly, "primitive democracy" based on
      capitalism and capitalist culture is not the same as primitive
      democracy in prehistoric or precapitalist times.  Capitalist
      culture has created large-scale production, factories, railways,
      the postal service, telephones, etc., and on this basis the
      great majority of the functions of the old "state power" have
      become so simplified and can be reduced to such exceedingly
      simple operations of registration, filing, and checking that
      they can be easily performed by every literate person, can quite
      easily be performed for ordinary "workmen's wages", and that
      these functions can (and must) be stripped of every shadow of
      privilege, of every semblance of "official grandeur".
    </p>

    <p>
      All officials, without exception, elected and subject to recall
      at any time, their salaries reduced to the level of ordinary
      "workmen's wages" &#8212; these simple and "self-evident"
      democratic measures, while completely uniting the interests of
      the workers and the majority of the peasants, at the same time
      serve as a bridge leading from capitalism to socialism.  These
      measures concern the reorganization of the state, the purely
      political reorganization of society; but, of course, they
      acquire their full meaning and significance only in connection
      with the "expropriation of the expropriators" either bring
      accomplished or in preparation, i.e., with the transformation of
      capitalist private ownership of the means of production into
      social ownership.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "The Commune," Marx wrote, "made the catchword of all bourgeois
      revolutions, cheap government, a reality, by abolishing the two
      greatest sources of expenditure--the army and the officialdom."
    </p>

    <p>
      From the peasants, as from other sections of the petty
      bourgeoisie, only an insignificant few "rise to the top", "get
      on in the world" in the bourgeois sense, i.e., become either
      well-to-do, bourgeois, or officials in secure and privileged
      positions.  In every capitalist country where there are peasants
      (as there are in most capitalist countries), the vast majority
      of them are oppressed by the government and long for its
      overthrow, long for &#8220;cheap&#8221; government.  This can be achieved
      only by the proletariat; and by achieving it, the proletariat at
      the same time takes a step towards the socialist reorganization
      of the state.

      3. Abolition of Parliamentarism
    </h4>

    
    <p class="quote">
      "The Commune," Marx wrote, "was to be a working, not a
      parliamentary, body, executive and legislative at the same 
      time.... 
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "Instead of deciding once in three or six years which member of
      the ruling class was to represent and repress [ver- and zertreten]
      the people in parliament, universal suffrage was to serve the
      people constituted in communes, as individual suffrage serves every
      other employer in the search for workers, foremen and accountants
      for his business."
    </p>


    <p>
      Owing to the prevalence of social-chauvinism and opportunism,
      this remarkable criticism of parliamentarism, made in 1871, also
      belongs now to the "forgotten words" of Marxism.  The
      professional Cabinet Ministers and parliamentarians, the
      traitors to the proletariat and the &#8220;practical&#8221; socialists of
      our day, have left all criticism of parliamentarism to the
      anarchists, and, on this wonderfully reasonable ground, they
      denounce all criticism of parliamentarism as &#8220;anarchism&#8221;!!  It
      is not surprising that the proletariat of the &#8220;advanced&#8221;
      parliamentary countries, disgusted with such &#8220;socialists&#8221; as the
      Scheidemanns, Davids, Legiens, Sembats, Renaudels, Hendersons,
      Vanderveldes, Staunings, Brantings, Bissolatis, and Co., has
      been with increasing frequency giving its sympathies to
      anarcho-syndicalism, in spite of the fact that the latter is
      merely the twin brother of opportunism.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Marx, however, revolutionary dialectics was never the empty
      fashionable phrase, the toy rattle, which Plekhanov, Kautsky and
      others have made of it.  Marx knew how to break with anarchism
      ruthlessly for its inability to make use even of the &#8220;pigsty&#8221; of
      bourgeois parliamentarism, especially when the situation was
      obviously not revolutionary; but at the same time he knew how to
      subject parliamentarism to genuinely revolutionary proletarian
      criticism.
    </p>

    <p>
      To decide once every few years which members of the ruling class
      is to repress and crush the people through parliament--this is
      the real essence of bourgeois parliamentarism, not only in
      parliamentary- constitutional monarchies, but also in the most
      democratic republics.
    </p>

    <p>
      But if we deal with the question of the state, and if we
      consider parliamentarism as one of the institutions of the
      state, from the point of view of the tasks of the proletariat in
      this field, what is the way out of parliamentarism? How can it
      be dispensed with?
    </p>

    <p>
      Once again, we must say: the lessons of Marx, based on the study
      of the Commune, have been so completely forgotten that the
      present-day "Social-Democrat" (i.e., present-day traitor to
      socialism) really cannot understand any criticism of
      parliamentarism other than anarchist or reactionary criticism.
    </p>

    <p>
      The way out of parliamentarism is not, of course, the abolition
      of representative institutions and the elective principle, but
      the conversion of the representative institutions from talking
      shops into &#8220;working&#8221; bodies.  "The Commune was to be a working,
      not a parliamentary, body, executive and legislative at the same
      time."
    </p>

    <p>
      "A working, not a parliamentary body"--this is a blow straight
      from the shoulder at the present-day parliamentarian country,
      from America to Switzerland, from France to Britain, Norway and
      so forth--in these countries the real business of &#8220;state&#8221; is
      performed behind the scenes and is carried on by the
      departments, chancelleries, and General Staffs.  parliament is
      given up to talk for the special purpose of fooling the "common
      people".  This is so true that even in the Russian republic, a
      bourgeois-democratic republic, all these sins of parliamentarism
      came out at once, even before it managed to set up a real
      parliament.  The heroes of rotten philistinism, such as the
      skobelevs and tseretelis, the Chernovs and Avksentyevs, have
      even succeeded in polluting the Soviets after the fashion of the
      most disgusting bourgeois parliamentarism, in converting them
      into mere talking shops.  In the Soviets, the &#8220;socialist&#8221;
      Ministers are fooling the credulous rustics with
      phrase-mongering and resolutions.  In the government itself a
      sort of permanent shuffle is going on in order that, on the one
      hand, as many Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks as
      possible may in turn get near the &#8220;pie&#8221;, the lucrative and
      honorable posts, and that, on the other hand, the &#8220;attention&#8221; of
      the people may be &#8220;engaged&#8221;.  meanwhile the chancelleries and
      army staffs &#8220;do&#8221; the business of &#8220;state&#8221;.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Dyelo Naroda</em>, the organ of the ruling
      Socialist-Revolutionary Party, recently admitted in a leading
      article--with the matchless frankness of people of "good
      society", in which &#8220;all&#8221; are engaged in political prostitution -
      that even in the ministeries headed by the &#8220;socialists&#8221; (save
      the mark!), the whole bureaucratic apparatus is in fact
      unchanged, is working in the old way and quite &#8220;freely&#8221;
      sabotaging revolutionary measures! Even without this admission,
      does not the actual history of the participation of the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in the government prove
      this? It is noteworthy, however, that in the ministerial company
      of the Cadets, the Chernovs, Rusanovs, Zenzinovs, and other
      editors of <em>Dyelo Naroda</em> have so completely lost all
      sense of shame as to brazenly assert, as if it were a mere
      bagetelle, that in &#8220;their&#8221; ministeries everything is unchanged!!
      Revolutionary-democratic phrases to gull the rural Simple
      Simons, and bureaucracy and red tape to "gladden the hearts" of
      the capitalists--that is the essence of the &#8220;honest&#8221; coalition.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Commune substitutes for the venal and rotten parliamentarism
      of bourgeois society institutions in which freedom of opinion
      and discussion does not degenerate into deception, for the
      parliamentarians themselves have to work, have to execute their
      own laws, have themselves to test the results achieved in
      reality, and to account directly to their constituents.
      Representative institutions remain, but there is no
      parliamentarism here as a special system, as the division of
      labor between the legislative and the executive, as a privileged
      position for the deputies.  We cannot imagine democracy, even
      proletarian democracy, without representative institutions, but
      we can and must imagine democracy without parliamentarism, if
      criticism of bourgeois society is not mere words for us, if the
      desire to overthrow the rule of the bourgeoisie is our earnest
      and sincere desire, and not a mere &#8220;election&#8221; cry for catching
      workers' votes, as it is with the Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, and also the Scheidemanns and
      Legiens, the Smblats and Vanderveldes.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is extremely instructive to note that, in speaking of the
      function of those officials who are necessary for the Commune
      and for proletarian democracy, Marx compares them to the workers
      of "every other employer", that is, of the ordinary capitalist
      enterprise, with its "workers, foremen, and accountants".
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no trace of utopianism in Marx, in the sense that he
      made up or invented a &#8220;new&#8221; society.  No, he studied the birth
      of the new society out of the old, and the forms of transition
      from the latter to the former, as a mass proletarian movement
      and tried to draw practical lessons from it.  He &#8220;Learned&#8221; from
      the Commune, just as all the great revolutionary thinkers
      learned unhesitatingly from the experience of great movements of
      the oppressed classes, and never addressed them with pedantic
      &#8220;homilies&#8221; (such as Plekhanov's: "They should not have taken up
      arms" or Tsereteli's: "A class must limit itself").
    </p>

    <p>
      Abolishing the bureaucracy at once, everywhere and completely,
      is out of the question.  It is a utopia.  But to smash the old
      bureaucratic machine at once and to begin immediately to
      construct a new one that will make possible the gradual
      abolition of all bureaucracy--this is not a utopia, it is the
      experience of the Commune, the direct and immediate task of the
      revolutionary proletariat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Capitalism simplifies the functions of &#8220;state&#8221; administration;
      it makes it possible to cast &#8220;bossing&#8221; aside and to confine the
      whole matter to the organization of the proletarians (as the
      ruling class), which will hire "workers, foremen and
      accountants" in the name of the whole of society.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are not utopians, we do not &#8220;dream&#8221; of dispensing at once
      with all administration, with all subordination.  These
      anarchist dreams, based upon incomprehension of the tasks of the
      proletarian dictatorship, are totally alien to Marxism, and, as
      a matter of fact, serve only to postpone the socialist
      revolution until people are different.  No, we want the
      socialist revolution with people as they are now, with people
      who cannot dispense with subordination, control, and "foremen
      and accountants".
    </p>

    <p>
      The subordination, however, must be to the armed vanguard of all
      the exploited and working people, i.e., to the proletariat.  A
      beginning can and must be made at once, overnight, to replace
      the specific &#8220;bossing&#8221; of state officials by the simple
      functions of "foremen and accountants", functions which are
      already fully within the ability of the average town dweller and
      can well be performed for "workmen's wages".
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>We</em>, the workers, shall organize large-scale production
      on the basis of what capitalism has already created, relying on
      our own experience as workers, establishing strict, iron
      discipline backed up by the state power of the armed workers.
      We shall reduce the role of state officials to that of simply
      carrying out our instructions as responsible, revocable,
      modestly paid "foremen and accountants" (of course, with the aid
      of technicians of all sorts, types and degrees).  This is our
      proletarian task, this is what we can and must start with in
      accomplishing the proletarian revolution.  Such a beginning, on
      the basis of large-scale production, will of itself lead to the
      gradual "withering away" of all bureaucracy, to the gradual
      creation of an order--an order without inverted commas, an
      order bearing no similarity to wage slavery--an order under
      which the functions of control and accounting, becoming more and
      more simple, will be performed by each in turn, will then become
      a habit and will finally die out as the special functions of a
      special section of the population.
    </p>

    <p>
      A witty German Social-Democrat of the seventies of the last
      century called the postal service an example of the socialist
      economic system.  This is very true.  At the present the postal
      service is a business organized on the lines of state-capitalist
      monopoly.  Imperialism is gradually transforming all trusts into
      organizations of a similar type, in which, standing over the
      &#8220;common&#8221; people, who are overworked and starved, one has the
      same bourgeois bureaucracy.  But the mechanism of social
      management is here already to hand.  Once we have overthrown the
      capitalists, crushed the resistance of these exploiters with the
      iron hand of the armed workers, and smashed the bureaucratic
      machinery of the modern state, we shall have a
      splendidly-equipped mechanism, freed from the &#8220;parasite&#8221;, a
      mechanism which can very well be set going by the united workers
      themselves, who will hire technicians, foremen and accountants,
      and pay them all, as indeed all &#8220;state&#8221; officials in general,
      workmen's wages.  Here is a concrete, practical task which can
      immediately be fulfilled in relation to all trusts, a task whose
      fulfilment will rid the working people of exploitation, a task
      which takes account of what the Commune had already begun to
      practice (particularly in building up the state).
    </p>

    <p>
      To organize the whole economy on the lines of the postal service
      so that the technicians, foremen and accountants, as well as all
      officials, shall receive salaries no higher than "a workman's
      wage", all under the control and leadership of the armed
      proletariat--that is our immediate aim.  This is what will
      bring about the abolition of parliamentarism and the
      preservation of representative institutions.  This is what will
      rid the laboring classes of the bourgeoisie's prostitution of
      these institutions.

      4. Organisation of National Unity
    </h4>


    <p class="quote">
      "In a brief sketch of national organization which the Commune
      had no time to develop, it states explicitly that the Commune
      was to be the political form of even the smallest village...."
      The communes were to elect the "National Delegation" in Paris.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "... The few but important functions which would still remain
      for a central government were not to to be suppressed, as had
      been deliberately mis-stated, but were to be transferred to
      communal, i.e., strictly responsible, officials.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "... National unity was not to be broken, but, on the contrary,
      organized by the communal constitution; it was to become a
      reality by the destruction of state power which posed as the
      embodiment of that unity yet wanted to be independent of, and
      superior to, the nation, on whose body it was but a parasitic
      excrescence.  While the merely repressive organs of the old
      governmental power were to be amputated, its legitimate
      functions were to be wrested from an authority claiming the
      right to stand above society, and restored to the responsible
      servants of society."
    </p>


    <p>
      The extent to which the opportunists of present-day
      Social-Democracy have failed--perhaps it would be more true to
      say, have refused--to understand these observations of Marx is
      best shown by that book of Herostratean fame of the renegade
      Bernstein, <em>The Premises of Socialism and the Tasks of the
      Social-Democrats</em>.  It is in connection with the above
      passage from Marx that Bernstein wrote that

      "as far as its political content", this programme "displays, in
      all its essential features, the greatest similarity to the
      federalism of Proudhon....  In spite of all the other points of
      difference between Marx and the 'petty-bourgeois' Proudhon
      [Bernstein places the word "petty-bourgeois" in inverted commas,
      to make it sound ironical] on these points, their lines of
      reasoning run as close as could be."

      Of course, Bernstein
      continues, the importance of the municipalities is growing, but

      "it seems doubtful to me whether the first job of democracy
      would be such a dissolution [Auflosung] of the modern states and
      such a complete transformation [Umwandlung] of their
      organization as is visualized by Marx and Proudhon (the
      formation of a National Assembly from delegates of the
      provincial of district assemblies, which, in their turn, would
      consist of delegates from the communes), so that consequently
      the previous mode of national representation would disappear."

      (Bernstein, <em>Premises</em>, German edition, 1899, pp.134 and 136)
    </p>

    <p>
      To confuse Marx's view on the "destruction of state power, a
      parasitic excrescence", with Proudhon's federalism is positively
      monstrous! But it is no accident, for it never occurs to the
      opportunist that Marx does not speak here at all about
      federalism as opposed to centralism, but about smashing the old,
      bourgeois state machine which exists in all bourgeois countries.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only thing that does occur to the opportunist is what he
      sees around him, in an environment of petty-bourgeois
      philistinism and &#8220;reformists&#8221; stagnation, namely, only
      &#8220;municipalities&#8221;! The opportunist has even grown out of the
      habit of thinking about proletarian revolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is ridiculous.  But the remarkable thing is that nobody
      argued with Bernstein on this point.  Bernstein has been refuted
      by many, especially by Plekhanov in Russian literature and by
      Kautsky in European literature, but neither of them has said
      anything about this distortion of Marx by Bernstein.
    </p>

    <p>
      The opportunist has so much forgotten how to think in a
      revolutionary way and to dwell on revolution that he attributes
      &#8220;federalism&#8221; to Marx, whom he confuses with the founder of
      anarchism, Proudhon.  As for Kautsky and Plekhanov, who claim to
      be orthodox Marxists and defenders of the theory of
      revolutionary Marxism, they are silent on this point!  Here is
      one of the roots of the extreme vulgarization of the views on
      the difference between Marxism and anarchism, which is
      characteristic of both the Kautskyites and the opportunists, and
      which we shall discuss again later.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is not a trace of federalism in Marx's above-quoted
      observation on the experience of the Commune.  Marx agreed with
      Proudhon on the very point that the opportunist Bernstein did
      not see.  Marx disagreed with Proudhon on the very point on
      which Bernstein found a similarity between them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Marx agreed with Proudhon in that they both stood for the
      &#8220;smashing&#8221; of the modern state machine.  Neither the
      opportunists nor the Kautskyites wish to see the similarity of
      views on this point between Marxism and anarchism (both Proudhon
      and Bakunin) because this is where they have departed from
      Marxism.
    </p>

    <p>
      Marx disagreed both with Proudhon and Bakunin precisely on the
      question of federalism (not to mention the dictatorship of the
      proletariat).  Federalism as a principle follows logically from
      the petty-bourgeois views of anarchism.  Marx was a centralist.
      There is no departure whatever from centralism in his
      observations just quoted.  Only those who are imbued with the
      philistine "superstitious belief" in the state can mistake the
      destruction of the bourgeois state machine for the destruction
      of centralism!
    </p>

    <p>
      Now if the proletariat and the poor peasants take state power
      into their own hands, organize themselves quite freely in
      communes, and unite the action of all the communes in striking
      at capital, in crushing the resistance of the capitalists, and
      in transferring the privately-owned railways, factories, land
      and so on to the entire nation, to the whole of society, won't
      that be centralism?  Won't that be the most consistent
      democratic centralism and, moreover, proletarian centralism?
    </p>

    <p>
      Bernstein simply cannot conceive of the possibility of voluntary
      centralism, of the voluntary fusion of the proletarian communes,
      for the sole purpose of destroying bourgeois rule and the
      bourgeois state machine.  Like all philistines, Bernstein
      pictures centralism as something which can be imposed and
      maintained solely from above, and solely by the bureaucracy and
      military clique.
    </p>

    <p>
      As though foreseeing that his views might be distorted, Marx
      expressly emphasized that the charge that the Commune had wanted
      to destroy national unity, to abolish the central authority, was
      a deliberate fraud.  Marx purposely used the words: "National
      unity was...  to be organized", so as to oppose conscious,
      democratic, proletarian centralism to bourgeois, military,
      bureaucratic centralism.
    </p>

    <p>
      But there are none so deaf as those who will not hear.  And the
      very thing the opportunists of present-day Social-Democracy do
      not want to hear about it the destruction of state power, the
      amputation of the parasitic excrescence.

      existence of the Commune involved, as a matter of course, local
      self-government, but no longer as a counterpoise to state power,

      &#8220;amputation&#8221;, its &#8220;smashing&#8221;; "state power, now become

      the state when appraising and analyzing the experience of the
      Commune.

      All this was written a little less than half a century ago; and
      now one has to engage in excavations, as it were, in order to
      bring undistorted Marxism to the knowledge of the mass of the
      people.  The conclusions drawn from the observation of the last
      great revolution which Marx lived through were forgotten just
      when the time for the next great proletarian revolution has
      arrived.

      was essentially a working-class government, the result of the

      The utopians busied themselves with &#8220;discovering&#8221; political
      forms under which the socialist transformation of society was to
      take place.  The anarchists dismissed the question of political
      forms altogether.  The opportunists of present-day
      Social-Democracy accepted the bourgeois political forms of the
      parliamentary democratic state as the limit which should not be
      overstepped; they battered their foreheads praying before this
      &#8220;model&#8221;, and denounced as anarchism every desire to break these
      forms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Marx deduced from the whole history of socialism and the
      political struggle that the state was bound to disappear, and
      that the transitional form of its disappearance (the transition
      from state to non-state) would be the "proletariat organized as
      the ruling class".  Marx, however, did not set out to discover
      the political forms of this future stage.  He limited himself to
      carefully observing French history, to analyzing it, and to
      drawing the conclusion to which the year 1851 had led, namely,
      that matters were moving towards destruction of the bourgeois
      state machine.

    <p>
      And when the mass revolutionary movement of the proletariat burst forth,
      Marx, in spite of its failure, in spite of its short life and patent
      weakness, began to study the forms it had discovered. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The Commune is the form "at last discovered" by the proletarian
      revolution, under which the economic emancipation of labor can take
      place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Commune is the first attempt by a proletarian revolution to
      smash the bourgeois state machine; and it is the political form
      "at last discovered", by which the smashed state machine can and
      must be replaced.
    </p>

    <p>
      We shall see further on that the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917,
      in different circumstances and under different conditions, continue the
      work of the Commune and confirm Marx's brilliant historical analysis.

      The Girondists--a political grouping during the French bourgeois
      revolution of the late eighteenth century, expressed the interests of the
      moderate bourgeoisie. They wavered between revolution and
      counter-revolution, and made deals with the monarchy.
