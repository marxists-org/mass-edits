      Marx gave the fundamentals concerning the significance of the
      experience of the Commune.  Engels returned to the same subject
      time and again, and explained Marx's analysis and conclusions,
      sometimes elucidating other aspects of the question with such
      power and vividness that it is necessary to deal with his
      explanations specially.
    </p>


    <h4>
      <a name="s1"></a>

      1. The Housing Question
    </h4>


    <p>
      In his work, 

      <a href="../../../../marx/works/1872/housing-question/index.htm">The Housing
      Question</a> (1872), Engels already took into account the
      experience of the Commune, and dealt several times with the
      tasks of the revolution in relation to the state.  It is
      interesting to note that the treatment of this specific subject
      clearly revealed, on the one hand, points of similarity between
      the proletarian state and the present state--points that
      warrant speaking of the state in both cases--and, on the other
      hand, points of difference between them, or the transition to
      the destruction of the state.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "How is the housing question to be settled then? In present-day
      society, it is settled just as any other social question: by the
      gradual economic levelling of demand and supply, a settlement
      which reproduces the question itself again and again and
      therefore is no settlement.  How a social revolution would
      settle this question not only depends on the circumstances in
      each particular case, but is also connected with much more
      far-reaching questions, one of the most fundamental of which is
      the abolition of the antithesis between town and country.  As it
      is not our task to create utopian systems for the organization
      of the future society, it would be more than idle to go into the
      question here.  But one thing is certain: there is already a
      sufficient quantity of houses in the big cities to remedy
      immediately all real 'housing shortage', provided they are used
      judiciously.  This can naturally only occur through the
      expropriation of the present owners and by quartering in their
      houses homeless workers or workers overcrowded in their present
      homes.  As soon as the proletariat has won political power, such
      a measure prompted by concern for the common good will be just
      as easy to carry out as are other expropriations and billetings
      by the present-day state."

      (German edition, 1887, p.

      22)<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw01" name="bk01">[1]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      The change in the form of state power is not examined here, but
      only the content of its activity.  Expropriations and billetings
      take place by order even of the present state.  From the formal
      point of view, the proletarian state will also &#8220;order&#8221; the
      occupation of dwellings and expropriation of houses.  But it is
      clear that the old executive apparatus, the bureaucracy, which
      is connected with the bourgeoisie, would simply be unfit to
      carry out the orders of the proletarian state.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "... It must be pointed out that the 'actual seizure' of all the
      instruments of labor, the taking possession of industry as a
      whole by the working people, is the exact opposite of the
      Proudhonist 'redemption'.  In the latter case the individual
      worker becomes the owner of the dwelling, the peasant farm, the
      instruments of labor; in the former case, the 'working people'
      remain the collective owners of the houses, factories and
      instruments of labor, and will hardly permit their use, at least
      during a transitional period, by individuals or associations
      without compensation for the cost.  In the same way, the
      abolition of property in land is not the abolition of ground
      rent but its transfer, if in a modified form, to society.  The
      actual seizure of all the instruments of labor by the working
      people, therefore, does not at all preclude the retention of
      rent relations."

      (p.68)
    </p>

    <p>
      We shall examine the question touched upon in this passage,
      namely, the economic basis for the withering away of the state,
      in the next chapter.  Engels expresses himself most cautiously.
      saying that the proletarian state would &#8220;hardly&#8221; permit the use
      of houses without payment, "at least during a transitional
      period".  The letting of houses owed by the whole people to
      individual families presupposes the collection of rent, a
      certain amount of control, nd the employment of some standard in
      allotting the housing.  All this calls for a certain form of
      state, but it does not at all call for a special military
      bureaucratic apparatus, with officials occupying especially
      privileged positions.  The transition to a situation in which it
      will be possible to supply dwellings rent-free depends on the
      complete "withering away" of the state.
    </p>

    <p>
      Speaking of the Blanquists' adoption of the fundamental position of
      Marxism after the Commune and under the influence of its experience,
      Engels, in passing, formulates this position as follows:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
     "... Necessity of political action by the proletariat and of its
     dictatorship as the transition to the abolition of classes and,
     with them, of the state...."

      (p.55)
    </p>

    <p>
      Addicts of hair-splitting criticism, or bourgeois "exterminators
      of Marxism", will perhaps see a contradiction between this
      recognition of the "abolition of the state" and repudiation of
      this formula as an anarchist one in the above passage from 

      <a href="../../../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/index.htm">Anti-D&#252;hring</a>.
      It would not be surprising if the opportunists classed Engels,
      too, as an &#8220;anarchist&#8221;, for it is becoming increasingly common
      with the social-chauvinists to accuse the internationalists of
      anarchism.
    </p>

    <p>
      Marxism has always taught that with the abolition of classes the
      state will also be abolished.  The well-known passage on the
      "withering away of the state in <em>Anti-D&#252;hring</em>
      accuses the anarchists not simply of favoring the abolition of
      the state, but of preaching that the state can be abolished
      &#8220;overnight&#8221;.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the now prevailing "Social-Democratic" doctrine completely
      distorts the relation of Marxism to anarchism on the question of
      the abolition of the state, it will be particularly useful to
      recall a certain controversy in which Marx and Engels came out
      against the anarchists.
    </p>


    <h4>
      <a name="s2"></a>

      Controversy with the Anarchists
    </h4>


    <p>
      This controversy took place in 1873.  Marx and Engels
      contributed articles against the Proudhonists, &#8220;autonomists&#8221; or
      "anti- authoritarians", to an Italian socialist annual, and it
      was not until 1913 that these articles appeared in German in
      <em>Neue 

	Zeit</em>.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw02" name="bk02">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "If the political struggle of the working class assumes
      revolutionary form," wrote Marx, ridiculing the anarchists for
      their repudiation of politics, "and if the workers set up their
      revolutionary dictatorship in place of the dictatorship of the
      bourgeoisie, they commit the terrible crime of violating
      principles, for in order to satisfy their wretched, vulgar
      everyday needs and to crush the resistance of the bourgeoisie,
      they give the state a revolutionary and transient form, instead
      of laying down their arms and abolishing the state."

      (<em>Neue Zeit</em> Vol.XXXII, 1, 1913-14, p.40)
    </p>

    <p>
      It was solely against this kind of &#8220;abolition&#8221; of the state that
      Marx fought in refuting the anarchists! He did not at all oppose
      the view that the state would disappear when classes
      disappeared, or that it would be abolished when classes were
      abolished.  What he did oppose was the proposition that the
      workers should renounce the use of arms, organized violence,
      that is, the state, which is to serve to "crush the resistance
      of the bourgeoisie".
    </p>

    <p>
      To prevent the true meaning of his struggle against anarchism
      from being distorted, Marx expressly emphasized the
      "revolutionary and transient form" of the state which the
      proletariat needs.  The proletariat needs the state only
      temporarily.  We do not after all differ with the anarchists on
      the question of the abolition of the state as the aim.  We
      maintain that, to achieve this aim, we must temporarily make use
      of the instruments, resources, and methods of state power
      against the exploiters, just as the temporary dictatorship of
      the oppressed class is necessary for the abolition of classes.
      Marx chooses the sharpest and clearest way of stating his case
      against the anarchists: After overthrowing the yoke of the
      capitalists, should the workers "lay down their arms", or use
      them against the capitalists in order to crush their resistance?
      But what is the systematic use of arms by ne class against
      another if not a "transient form" of state?
    </p>

    <p>
      Let every Social-Democrat ask himself: Is that how he has been
      posing the question of the state in controversy with the
      anarchists? Is that how it has been posed by the vast majority
      of the official socialist parties of the Second International?
    </p>

    <p>
      Engels expounds the same ideas in much greater detail and still
      more popularly.  First of all he ridicules the muddled ideas of
      the Proudhonists, who call themselves "anti-authoritarians",
      i.e., repudiated all authority, all subordination, all power.
      Take a factory, a railway, a ship on the high seas, said Engels:
      is it not clear that not one of these complex technical
      establishments, based on the use of machinery and the systematic
      co-operation of many people, could function without a certain
      amount of subordination and, consequently, without a certain
      amount of authority or power?
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "... When I counter the most rabid anti-authoritarians with
      these arguments, they only answer they can give me is the
      following: Oh, that's true, except that here it is not a
      question of authority with which we vest our delegates, but of a
      commission! These people imagine they can change a thing by
      changing its name...."
    </p>

    <p>
      Having thus shown that authority and autonomy are relative
      terms, that the sphere of their application varies with the
      various phases of social development, that it is absurd to take
      them as absolutes, and adding that the sphere of application of
      machinery and large-scale production is steadily expanding,
      Engels passes from the general discussion of authority to the
      question of the state.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "Had the autonomists," he wrote, "contented themselves with
      saying that the social organization of the future would allow
      authority only within the bounds which the conditions of
      production make inevitable, one could have come to terms with
      them.  But they are blind to all facts that make authority
      necessary and they passionately fight the word.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "Why do the anti-authoritarians not confine themselves to crying
      out against political authority, the state? All socialists are
      agreed that the state, and with it political authority, will
      disappear as a result of the coming social revolution, that is,
      that public functions will lose their political character and
      become mere administrative functions of watching over social
      interests.  But the anti-authoritarians demand that the
      political state be abolished at one stroke, even before the
      social relations that gave both to it have been destroyed.  They
      demand that the first act of the social revolution shall be the
      abolition of authority.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "Have these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? A revolution is
      certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is an act
      whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the
      other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon, all of which
      are highly authoritarian means.  And the victorious party must
      maintain its rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire
      in the reactionaries.  Would the Paris Commune have lasted more
      than a day if it had not used the authority of the armed people
      against the bourgeoisie? Cannot we, on the contrary, blame it
      for having made too little use of that authority? Therefore, one
      of two things: either that anti-authoritarians down't know what
      they are talking about, in which case they are creating nothing
      but confusion.  Or they do know, and in that case they are
      betraying the cause of the proletariat.  In either case they
      serve only reaction."

      (p.39)
    </p>

    <p>
      This argument touches upon questions which should be examined in
      connection with the relationship between politics and economics
      during the withering away of the state (the next chapter is
      devoted to this).  These questions are: the transformation of
      public functions from political into simple functions of
      administration, and the "political state".  This last term, one
      particularly liable to misunderstanding, indicates the process
      of the withering away of the state: at a certain stage of this
      process, the state which is withering away may be called a
      non-political state.
    </p>

    <p>
      Against, the most remarkable thing in this argument of Engels'
      is the way he states his case against the anarchists.
      Social-Democrats, claiming to be disciples of Engels, have
      argued on this subject against the anarchists millions of times
      since 1873, but they have not argued as Marxists could and
      should.  The anarchist idea of abolition of the state is muddled
      and non-revolutionary--that is how Engels put it.  It is
      precisely the revolution in its rise and development, with its
      specific tasks in relation to violence, authority, power, the
      state, that the anarchists refuse to see.
    </p>

    <p>
      The usual criticism of anarchism by present-day Social-Democrats
      has boiled down to the purest philistine banality: "We recognize
      the state, whereas the anarchists do not!" Naturally, such
      banality cannot but repel workers who are at all capable of
      thinking and revolutionary-minded.  What Engels says is
      different.  He stresses that all socialists recognize that the
      state will disappear as a result of the socialist revolution.
      He then deals specifically with the question of the revolution -
      the very question which, as a rule, the Social-Democrats evade
      out of opportunism, leaving it, so to speak, exclusively for the
      anarchists "to work out".  And when dealing with this question,
      Engels takes the bull by the horns; he asks: should not the
      Commune have made more use of the revolutionary power of the
      state, that is, of the proletariat armed and organized as the
      ruling class?
    </p>

    <p>
      Prevailing official Social-Democracy usually dismissed the
      question of the concrete tasks of the proletariat in the
      revolution either with a philistine sneer, or, at best, with the
      sophistic evasion: "The future will show".  And the anarchists
      were justified in saying about such Social-Democrats that they
      were failing in their task of giving the workers a revolutionary
      education.  Engels draws upon the experience of the last
      proletarian revolution precisely for the purpose of making a
      most concrete study of what should be done by the proletariat,
      and in what manner, in relation to both the banks and the state.
    </p>




    <h4>
      <a name="s3"></a>

      Letter to Bebel
    </h4>


    <p>
      One of the most, if not the most, remarkable observation on the
      state in the works of Marx and Engels is contained in the
      following passage in Engels' letter to Bebel dated March 18-28,
      1875.  This letter, we may observe in parenthesis, was, as far
      as we know, first published by Bebel in the second volume of his
      memoirs (<em>Aus meinem Leben</em>), which appeared in 1911,
      i.e., 36 years after the letter had been written and sent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Engels wrote to Bebel criticizing the same draft of the Gotha Programme
      which Marx criticized in his famous letter to Bracke.  Referring
      specially to the question of the state, Engels said:
    </p>

<p class="quote">
     "The free people's state has been transferred into the free
     state.  Taken in its grammatical sense, a free state is one where
     the state is free in relation to its citizens, hence a state with
     a despotic government.  The whole talk about the state should be
     dropped, especially since the Commune, which was no longer a
     state in the proper sense of the word.  The 'people's state' has
     been thrown in our faces by the anarchists to the point of
     disgust, although already Marx's book against Proudhon and later
     the <a
     href="../../../../marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm">Communist
     Manifesto</a> say plainly that with the introduction of the
     socialist order of society the state dissolves of itself [sich
     auflost] and disappears.  As the state is only a transitional
     institution which is used in the struggle, in the revolution, to
     hold down one's adversaries by force, it is sheer nonsense to
     talk of a 'free people's state'; so long as the proletariat still
     needs the state, it does not need it in the interests of freedom
     but in order to hold down its adversaries, and as soon as it
     becomes possible to speak of freedom the state as such ceases to
     exist.  We would therefore propose replacing the state everywhere
     by <em>Gemeinwesen</em>, a good old German word which can very
     well take the place of the French word commune."

      (<a
	  href="../../../../marx/works/1875/letters/75_03_18.htm#staterev">pp.321-22
	of the German original</a>.)<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw03" name="bk03">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      It should be borne in mind that this letter refers to the party
      programme which Marx criticized in a letter dated only a few
      weeks later than the above (Marx's letter is dated <a href="../../../../marx/works/1875/letters/75_05_05.htm">May 5,
      1875</a>), and that at the time Engels was living with Marx in
      London.  Consequently, when he says &#8220;we&#8221; in the last sentence,
      Engels undoubtedly, in his own as well as in Marx's name,
      suggests to the leader of the German workers' party that the
      word &#8220;state&#8221; be struck out of the programme and replaced by the
      word &#8220;community&#8221;.
    </p>

    <p>
      What a howl about &#8220;anarchism&#8221; would be raised by the leading
      lights of present-day &#8220;Marxism&#8221;, which has been falsified for
      the convenience of the opportunists, if such an amendment of the
      programme were suggested to them!
    </p>

    <p>
      Let them howl.  This will earn them the praises of the bourgeoisie. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And we shall go on with our work.  In revising the programme of
      our Party, we must by all means take the advice of Engels and
      Marx into consideration in order to come nearer the truth, to
      restore Marxism by ridding it of distortions, to guide the
      struggle of the working class for its emancipation more
      correctly.  Certainly no one opposed to the advice of Engels and
      Marx will be found among the Bolsheviks.  The only difficulty
      that may perhaps arise will be in regard to the term.  In German
      there are two words meaning &#8220;community&#8221;, of which Engels used
      the one which does not denote a single community, but their
      totality, a system of communities.  In Russian there is no such
      word, and we may have to choose the French word &#8220;commune&#8221;,
      although this also has its drawbacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The Commune was no longer a state in the proper sense of the
      word"--this is the most theoretically important statement
      Engels makes.  After what has been said above, this statement is
      perfectly clear.  The Commune was ceasing to be a state since it
      had to suppress, not the majority of the population, but a
      minority (the exploiters).  It had smashed the bourgeois state
      machine.  In place of a special coercive force the population
      itself came on the scene.  All this was a departure from the
      state in the proper sense of the word.  And had the Commune
      become firmly established, all traces of the state in it would
      have "withered away" of themselves; it would not have had to
      &#8220;abolish&#8221; the institutions of the state--they would have ceased
      to function as they ceased to have anything to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The 'people's state' has been thrown in our faces by the
      anarchists".  In saying this, Engels above all has in mind
      Bakunin and his attacks on the German Social-Democrats.  Engels
      admits that these attacks were justified insofar as the
      "people's state" was as much an absurdity and as much a
      departure from socialism as the "free people's state".  Engels
      tried to put the struggle of the German Social-Democrats against
      the anarchists on the right lines, to make this struggle correct
      in principle, to ride it of opportunist prejudices concerning
      the &#8220;state&#8221;.  Unfortunately, Engels' letter was pigeon-holed for
      36 years.  We shall see farther on that, even after this letter
      was published, Kautsky persisted in virtually the same mistakes
      against which Engels had warned.

    <p>
      Bebel replied to Engels in a letter dated September 21, 1875, in
      which he wrote, among other things, that he "fully agreed" with
      Engels' opinion of the draft programme, and that he had
      reproached Liebknecht with readiness to make concessions (p.334
      of the German edition of Bebel's memoirs, Vol.II).  But if we
      take Bebel's pamphlet, <em>Our Aims</em>, we find there views on
      the state that are absolutely wrong.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "The state must...  be transformed from one based on class rule
      into a people's state." 

      (<em>Unsere Ziele</em>, 1886, p.14)
    </p>

    <p>
      This was printed in the ninth (ninth!) edition of Bebel's
      pamphlet! It is not surprising that opportunist views on the
      state, so persistently repeated, were absorbed by the German
      Social-Democrats, especially as Engels' revolutionary
      interpretations had been safely pigeon-holed, and all the
      conditions of life were such as to &#8220;wean&#8221; them from revolution
      for a long time.

      2. Criticism of the Draft of the Erfurt Programme
    </h4>

    
    <p>
      In analyzing Marxist teachings on the state, the criticism of
      the draft of the Erfurt 

      Programme,<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw04" name="bk04">[4]</a></sup>

      sent by Engels to Kautsky on
      June 29, 1891, and published only 10 years later in <em>Neue
      Zeit</em>, cannot be ignored; for it is with the opportunist
      views of the Social-Democrats on questions of state organization
      that this criticism is mainly concerned.
    </p>

    <p>
      We shall note in passing that Engels also makes an exceedingly
      valuable observation on economic questions, which shows how
      attentively and thoughtfully he watched the various changes
      occurring in modern capitalism, and how for this reason he was
      able to foresee to a certain extent the tasks of our present,
      the imperialist, epoch.  Here is that observation: referring to
      the word &#8220;planlessness&#8221; (Planlosigkeit), used in the draft
      programme, as characteristic of capitalism, Engels wrote:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "When we pass from joint-stock companies to trusts which assume
      control over, and monopolize, whole industries, it is not only
      private production that ceases, but also planlessness."

      (<em>Neue Zeit</em>, Vol. XX, 1,
      1901-02, p.8)
    </p>

    <p>
      Here was have what is most essential in the theoretical
      appraisal of the latest phase of capitalism, i.e., imperialism,
      namely, that capitalism becomes monopoly capitalism.  The latter
      must be emphasized because the erroneous bourgeois reformist
      assertion that monopoly capitalism or state-monopoly capitalism
      is no longer capitalism, but can now be called "state socialism"
      and so on, is very common.  The trusts, of course, never
      provided, do not now provide, and cannot provide complete
      planning.  But however much they do plan, however much the
      capitalist magnates calculate in advance the volume of
      production on a national and even on an international scale, and
      however much they systematically regulate it, we still remain
      under capitalism--at its new stage, it is true, but still
      capitalism, without a doubt.  The &#8220;proximity&#8221; of such capitalism
      to socialism should serve genuine representatives of the
      proletariat as an argument proving the proximity, facility,
      feasibility, and urgency of the socialist revolution, and not at
      all as an argument for tolerating the repudiation of such a
      revolution and the efforts to make capitalism look more
      attractive, something which all reformists are trying to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      But to return to the question of the state.  In his letter
      Engels makes three particularly valuable suggestions: first, in
      regard to the republic; second, in regard to the connection
      between the national question and state organization; and,
      third, in regard to local self-government.
    </p>

    <p>
      In regard to the republic, Engels made this the focal point of
      this criticism of the draft of the Erfurt Programme.  And when
      we recall the importance which the Erfurt Programme acquired for
      all the Social- Democrats of the world, and that it became the
      model for the whole Second International, we may say without
      exaggeration that Engels thereby criticizes the opportunism of
      the whole Second International.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "The political demands of the draft," engels wrote, "have one great
      fault.  <em>It lacks</em> [Engels' italics] precisely what should have
      been said."
    </p>

    <p>
      And, later on, he makes it clear that the German Constitution
      is, strictly speaking, a copy of the extremely reactionary
      Constitution of 1850, that the Reichstag is only, as Wilhelm
      Liebknecht put it, "the fig leaf of absolutism" and that to wish
      "to transform all the instruments of labor into common property"
      on the basis of a constitution which legalizes the existence of
      petty states and the federation of petty German states is an
      "obvious absurdity".
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "To touch on that is dangerous, however," Engels added, knowing
      only too well that it was impossible legally to include in the
      programme the demand for a republic in Germany.  But he refused
      to merely accept this obvious consideration which satisfied
      &#8220;everybody&#8221;.  He continued: "Nevertheless, somehow or other, the
      thing has to be attacked.  How necessary this is is shown
      precisely at the present time by opportunism, which is gaining
      ground [einreissende] in a large section of the Social-Democrat
      press.  Fearing a renewal of the Anti-Socialist 

      Law,<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw05" name="bk05">[5]</a></sup>

      or
      recalling all manner of overhasty pronouncements made during the
      reign of that law, they now want the Party to find the present
      legal order in Germany adequate for putting through all Party
      demands by peaceful means...."
    </p>

    <p>
      Engels particularly stressed the fundamental fact that the
      German Social-Democrats were prompted by fear of a renewal of
      the Anti- Socialist Law, and explicitly described it as
      opportunism; he declared that precisely because there was no
      republic and no freedom in Germany, the dreams of a &#8220;peaceful&#8221;
      path were perfectly absurd.  Engels was careful not to tie his
      hands.  He admitted that in republican or very free countries
      "one can conceive" (only &#8220;conceive&#8221;!) of a peaceful development
      towards socialism, but in Germany, he repeated,
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "... in Germany, where the government is almost omnipotent and
      the Reichstag and all other representative bodies have no real
      power, to advocate such a thing in Germany, where, moreover,
      there is no need to do so, means removing the fig leaf from
      absolutism and becoming oneself a screen for its nakedness."
    </p>

    <p>
      The great majority of the official leaders of the German Social-
      Democratic Party, which pigeon-holed this advice, have really proved to
      be a screen for absolutism. 
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "... In the long run such a policy can only lead one's own party
      astray.  They push general, abstract political questions into
      the foreground, thereby concealing the immediate concrete
      questions, which at the moment of the first great events, the
      first political crisis, automatically pose themselves.  What can
      result from this except that at the decisive moment the party
      suddenly proves helpless and that uncertainty and discord on the
      most decisive issues reign in it because these issues have never
      been discussed? ...
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "This forgetting of the great, the principal considerations for
      the momentary interests of the day, this struggling and striving
      for the success of the moment regardless of later consequences,
      this sacrifice of the future of the movement for its present may
      be 'honestly' meant, but it is and remains opportunism, and
      'honest' opportunism is perhaps the most dangerous of all....
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "If one thing is certain it is that our party and the working
      class can only come to power in the form of the democratic
      republic.  This is even the specific form for the dictatorship
      of the proletariat, as the Great French Revolution has already
      shown...."
    </p>

    <p>
      Engels realized here in a particularly striking form the
      fundamental idea which runs through all of Marx's works, namely,
      that the democratic republic is the nearest approach to the
      dictatorship of the proletariat.  For such a republic, without
      in the least abolishing the rule of capital, and, therefore, the
      oppression of the masses nd the class struggle, inevitably leads
      to such an extension, development, unfolding, and
      intensification of this struggle that, as soon as it becomes
      possible to meet the fundamental interests of the oppressed
      masses, this possibility is realized inevitably and solely
      through the dictatorship of the proletariat, through the
      leadership of those masses by the proletariat.  These, too, are
      "forgotten words" of marxism for the whole of the Second
      International, and the fact that they have been forgotten was
      demonstrated with particular vividness by the history of the
      Menshevik Party during the first six months of the Russian
      revolution of 1917.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the subject of a federal republic, in connection with the national
      composition of the population, Engels wrote:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "What should take the place of the present-day Germany [with its
      reactionary monarchical Constitution and its equally reactionary
      division into petty states, a division which perpetuates all the
      specific features of &#8220;Prussianism&#8221; instead of dissolving them in
      Germany as a whole]? In my view, the proletariat can only use
      the form of the one and indivisible republic.  In the gigantic
      territory of the United States, a federal republic is still, on
      the whole, a necessity, although in the Eastern states it is
      already becoming a hindrance.  It would be a step forward in
      Britain where the two islands are peopled by four nations and in
      spite of a single Parliament three different systems of
      legislation already exist side by side.  In little Switzerland,
      it has long been a hindrance, tolerable only because Switzerland
      is content to be a purely passive member of the European state
      system.  For Germany, federalization on the Swiss model would be
      an enormous step backward.  Two points distinguish a union state
      from a completely unified state: first, that each member state,
      each canton, has its own civil and criminal legislative and
      judicial system, and, second, that alongside a popular chamber
      there is also a federal chamber in which each canton, whether
      large or small, votes as such." In Germany, the union state is
      the transition to the completely unified state, and the
      "revolution from above" of 1866 and 1870 must not be reversed
      but supplemented by a "movement from below".
    </p>

    <p>
      Far from being indifferent to the forms of state, Engels, on the
      contrary, tried to analyze the transitional forms with the
      utmost thoroughness in order to establish, in accordance with
      the concrete historical peculiarities of each particular case,
      from what and to what the given transitional form is passing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Approaching the matter from the standpoint of the proletariat
      and the proletarian revolution, Engels, like Marx, upheld
      democratic centralism, the republic--one and indivisible.  He
      regarded the federal republic either as an exception and a
      hindrance to development, or as a transition from a monarchy to
      a centralized republic, as a "step forward" under certain
      special conditions.  And among these special conditions, he puts
      the national question to the fore.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although mercilessly criticizing the reactionary nature of small
      states, and the screening of this by the national question in
      certain concrete cases, Engels, like Marx, never betrayed the
      slightest desire to brush aside the national question--a desire
      of which the Dutch and Polish Marxists, who proceed from their
      perfectly justified opposition to the narrow philistine
      nationalism of &#8220;their&#8221; little states, are often guilty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even in regard to britain, where geographical conditions, a
      common language and the history of many centuries would seem to
      have "put an end" to the national question in the various small
      divisions of the country--even in regard to to that country,
      Engels reckoned with the plain fact that the national question
      was not yet a thing of the past, and recognized in consequence
      that the establishment of a federal republic would be a "step
      forward".  Of course, there is not the slightest hint here of
      Engels abandoning the criticism of the shortcomings of a federal
      republic or renouncing the most determined advocacy of, and
      struggle for, a unified and centralized democratic republic.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Engels did not at all men democratic centralism in the
      bureaucratic sense in which the term is used by bourgeois and
      petty-bourgeois ideologists, the anarchists among the latter.
      His idea of centralism did not in the least preclude such broad
      local self-government as would combine the voluntary defence of
      the unity of the state by the &#8220;communes&#8221; and districts, and the
      complete elimination of all bureaucratic practices and all
      &#8220;ordering&#8221; from above.  Carrying forward the programme views of
      Marxism on the state, Engels wrote:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "So, then, a unified republic--but not in the sense of the
      present French Republic, which is nothing but the Empire
      established in 1798 without the Emperor.  From 1792 to 1798 each
      French department, each commune [Gemeinde], enjoyed complete
      self-government on the American model, and this is what we too
      must have.  How self-government is to be organized and how we
      can manage, without a bureaucracy has been shown to us by
      America and the first French Republic, and is being shown even
      today by Australia, Canada and the other English colonies.  And
      a provincial [regional] and communal self-government of this
      type is far freer than, for instance, Swiss federalism, under
      which, it is true, the canton is very independent in relation to
      the Bund [i.e., the federated state as a whole], but is also
      independent in relation to the district [Bezirk] and the
      commune.  The cantonal governments appoint the district
      governors [Bezirksstatthalter] and prefects--which is unknown
      in English-speaking countries and which we want to abolish here
      as resolutely in the future as the Prussian Landrate and
      Regierungsrate" (commissioners, district police chiefs,
      governors, and in general all officials appointed from above).
      Accordingly, Engels proposes the following words for the
      self-government clause in the programme: "Complete
      self-government for the provinces [gubernias or regions],
      districts and communes through officials elected by universal
      suffrage.  The abolition of all local and provincial authorities
      appointed by the state."
    </p>

    <p>
      I have already had occassion to point out--in <em>Pravda</em>
      (No.68, May 28, 1917), which was suppressed by the government of
      Kerensky and other &#8220;socialist&#8221; Ministers--how on this point (of
      course, not on this point alone by any mens) our
      pseudo-socialist representatives of pseudo- revolutionary
      pseudo-democracy have made glaring departures from democracy.
      Naturally, people who have bound themselves by a &#8220;coalition&#8221; to
      the imperialist bourgeoisie have remained deaf to this
      criticism.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is extremely important to note that Engels, armed with facts,
      disproved by a most precise example the prejudice which is very
      widespread, particularly among petty-bourgeois democrats, that a
      federal republic necessarily means a greater amount of freedom
      than a centralized republic.  This is wrong.  It is disproved by
      the facts cited by Engels regarding the centralized French
      Republic of 792-98 and the federal Swiss Republic.  The really
      democratic centralized republic gave more freedom that the
      federal republic.  In other words, the greatest amount of local,
      regional, and other freedom known in history was accorded by a
      centralized and not a federal republic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Insufficient attention has been and is being paid in our Party
      propaganda and agitation to this fact, as, indeed, to the whole
      question of the federal and the centralized republic and local
      self-government.

    <h4>
      <a name="s5"></a>

      The 1891 Preface to Marx's "The Civil War in France"
    </h4>


    <p>
      In his <a href="../../../../marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/postscript.htm">preface</a>
      to the third edition of <a href="../../../../marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm">The
      Civil War in France</a> (this preface is dated March 18, 1891,
      and was originally published in <em>Neue Zeit</em>), Engels, in
      addition to some interesting incidental remarks on questions
      concerning the attitude towards the state, gave a remarkably
      vivid summary of the lessons of the 

      Commune.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw06" name="bk06">[6]</a></sup>

      This summary, made
      more profound by the entire experience of the 20 years that
      separated the author from the Commune, and directed expressly
      against the "superstitious belief in the state" so widespread in
      Germany, may justly be called the last word of Marxism on the
      question under consideration.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      In France, Engels observed, the workers emerged with arms from
      every revolution: "therefore the disarming of the workers was
      the first commandment for the bourgeois, who were at the helm of
      the state.  Hence, after every revolution won by the workers, a
      new struggle, ending with the defeat of the workers."
    </p>

    <p>
      This summary of the experience of bourgeois revolutions is as
      concise as it is expressive.  The essence of the matter--among
      other things, on the question of the state (has the oppressed
      class arms?)--is here remarkably well-grasped.  It is precisely
      this essence that is most often evaded by both professors
      influenced by bourgeois ideology, and by petty-bourgeois
      democrats.  In the Russian revolution of 1917, the honor
      (Cavaignac honor) of blabbing this secret of bourgeois
      revolutions fell to the Menshevik, would-be Marxist, Tsereteli.
      In his &#8220;historic&#8221; speech of June 11, Tsereteli blurted out that
      the bourgeoisie were determined to disarm the Petrograd workers--presenting, of course, this decision as his own, and as a
      necessity for the &#8220;state&#8221; in general!
    </p>

    <p>
      Tsereteli's historical speech of June 11 will, of course, serve
      every historian of the revolution of 1917 as a graphic
      illustration of how the Social-Revolutionary and Menshevik bloc,
      led by Mr. Tsereteli, deserted to the bourgeoisie against the
      revolutionary proletariat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another incidental remark of Engels', also connected with the
      question of the state, deals with religion.  It is well-known
      that the German Social-Democrats, as they degenerated and became
      increasingly opportunist, slipped more and more frequently into
      the philistine misinterpretation of the celebrated formula:
      "Religion is to be declared a private matter." That is, the
      formula was twisted to mean that religion was a private matter
      even for the party of the revolutionary proletariat!! It was
      against this complete betrayal of the revolutionary programme of
      the proletariat that Engels vigorously protested.  In 1891 he
      saw only the very feeble beginnings of opportunism in his party,
      and, therefore, he expressed himself with extreme caution:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "As almost only workers, or recognized representatives of the
      workers, sat in the Commune, its decisions bore a decidedly
      proletarian character.  Either they decreed reforms which the
      republican bourgeoisie had failed to pass solely out of
      cowardice, but which provided a necessary basis for the free
      activity of the working class--such as the realization of the
      principle that <em>in relation to the state</em> religion is a
      purely private matter--or the Commune promulgated decrees which
      were in the direct interest of the working class and in part cut
      deeply into the old order of society."
    </p>

    <p>
      Engels deliberately emphasized the words "in relation to the
      state" as a straight thrust at at German opportunism, which had
      declared religion to be a private matter in relation to the
      party, thus degrading the party of the revolutionary proletariat
      to the level of the most vulgar "free- thinking" philistinism,
      which is prepared to allow a non-denominational status, but
      which renounces the party struggle against the opium of religion
      which stupifies the people.
    </p>

    <p>
      The future historian of the German Social-Democrats, in tracing
      the roots of their shameful bankruptcy in 1914, will find a fair
      amount of interesting material on this question, beginning with
      the evasive declarations in the articles of the party's
      ideological leader, Kautsky, which throw the door wide open to
      opportunism, and ending with the attitude of the party towards
      the 

      "Los-von-Kirche-Bewegung"<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw07" name="bk07">[7]</a></sup>

      (the "Leave-the-Church" movement) in 1913.
    </p>

    <p>
      But let us see how, 20 years after the Commune, Engels summed up its
      lessons for the fighting proletariat. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Here are the lessons to which Engels attached prime importance:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "... It was precisely the oppressing power of the former
      centralized government, army, political parties, bureaucracy,
      which Napoleon had created in 1798 and which every new
      government had since then taken over as a welcome instrument and
      used against its opponents--it was this power which was to fall
      everywhere, just as it had fallen in Paris.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "From the very outset the Commune had to recognize that the
      working class, once in power, could not go on managing with the
      old state machine; that in order not to lose again its only
      just-gained supremacy, this working class must, on the one hand,
      do away with all the old machinery of oppression previously used
      against it itself, and, on the other, safeguard itself against
      its own deputies and officials, by declaring them all, without
      exception, subject to recall at any time...."
    </p>

    <p>
      Engels emphasized once again that not only under a monarchy, but
      also under a democratic republic the state remains a state,
      i.e., it retains its fundamental distinguishing feature of
      transforming the officials, the 'servants of society", its
      organs, into the masters of society.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "Against this transformation of the state and the organs of the
      state from servants of society into masters of society--an
      inevitable transformation in all previous states--the Commune
      used two infallible means.  In the first place, it filled all
      posts--administrative, judicial, and educational--by election
      on the basis of universal suffrage of all concerned, subject to
      recall at any time by the electors.  And, in the second place,
      it paid all officials, high or low, only the wages received by
      other workers.  The highest salary paid by the Commune to anyone
      was 6,000 francs.  In this way a dependable barrier to
      place-hunting and careerism was set up, even apart from the
      binding mandates to delegates to representative bodies, which
      were added besides...."
    </p>

    <p>
      Engels here approached the interesting boundary line at which
      consistent democracy, on the one hand, is transformed into
      socialism and, on the other, demands socialism.  For, in order
      to abolish the state, it is necessary to convert the functions
      of the civil service into the simple operations of control and
      accounting that are within the scope and ability of the vast
      majority of the population, and, subsequently, of every single
      individual.  And if careerism is to be abolished completely, it
      must be made impossible for &#8220;honorable&#8221; though profitless posts
      in the Civil Service to be used as a springboard to highly
      lucrative posts in banks or joint-stock companies, as constantly
      happens in all the freest capitalist countries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Engels, however, did not make the mistake some Marxists make in
      dealing, for example, with the question of the right of nations
      to self- determination, when they argue that is is impossible
      under capitalism and will be superfluous under socialism.  This
      seemingly clever but actually incorrect statement might be made
      in regard to any democratic institution, including moderate
      salaries for officials, because fully consistent democracy is
      impossible under capitalism, and under socialism all democracy
      will wither away.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a sophism like the old joke about a man becoming bald by losing
      one more hair. 
    </p>

    <p>
      To develop democracy to the utmost, to find the forms for this
      development, to test them by practice, and so fort--all this is
      one of the component tasks of the struggle for the social
      revolution.  Taken separately, no kind of democracy will bring
      socialism.  But in actual life democracy will never be "taken
      separately"; it will be "taken together" with other things, it
      will exert its influence on economic life as well, will
      stimulate its transformation; and in its turn it will be
      influenced by economic development, and so on.  This is the
      dialectics of living history.
    </p>

    <p>
      Engels continued:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "... This shattering [Sprengung] of the former state power and
      its replacement by a new and truly democratic one is described
      in detail in the third section of <em>The Civil War</em>.  But
      it was necessary to touch briefly here once more on some of its
      features, because in Germany particularly the superstitious
      belief in the state has passed from philosophy into the general
      consciousness of the bourgeoisie and even of many workers.
      According to the philosophical conception, the state is the
      'realization of the idea', or the Kingdom of God on earth,
      translated into philosophical terms, the sphere in which eternal
      truth and justice are, or should be, realized.  And from this
      follows a superstitious reverence for the state and everything
      connected with it, which takes root the more readily since
      people are accustomed from childhood to imagine that the affairs
      and interests common to the whole of society could not be looked
      after other than as they have been looked after in the past,
      that is, through the state and its lucratively positioned
      officials.  And people think they have taken quite an
      extraordinary bold step forward when they have rid themselves of
      belief in hereditary monarchy and swear by the democratic
      republic.  In reality, however, the state is nothing but a
      machine for the oppression of one class by another, and indeed
      in the democratic republic no less than in the monarchy.  And at
      best it is an evil inherited by the proletariat after its
      victorious struggle for class supremacy, whose worst sides the
      victorious proletariat will have to lop off as speedily as
      possible, just as the Commune had to, until a generation reared
      in new, free social conditions is able to discard the entire
      lumber of the state."
    </p>

    <p>
      Engels warned the Germans not to forget the principles of
      socialism with regard to the state in general in connection with
      the substitution of a republic for the monarchy.  His warnings
      now read like a veritable lesson to the Tseretelis and Chernovs,
      who in their &#8220;coalition&#8221; practice have revealed a superstitious
      belief in, and a superstitious reverence for, the state!
    </p>

    <p>
      Two more remarks.  

      1. Engels' statement that in a democratic republic, "no less"
      than in a monarchy, the state remains a "machine for the
      oppression of one class by another" by no means signifies
      that the form of oppression makes no difference to the
      proletariat, as some anarchists &#8220;teach&#8221;.  A wider, freer
      and more open form of the class struggle and of class
      oppression vastly assists the proletariat in its struggle
      for the abolition of classes in general.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. Why will only a new generation be able to discard the entire lumber
      of the state? This question is bound up with that of overcoming
      democracy, with which we shall deal now. 
    </p>

    <h4>
      <a name="s6"></a>

      Engels on the Overcoming of Democracy
    </h4>


    <p>
      Engels came to express his views on this subject when establishing that
      the term "Social-Democrat" was scientifically wrong. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In a preface to an edition of his articles of the seventies on
      various subjects, mostly on &#8220;international&#8221; questions
      (<em>Internationales aus dem Volkstaat</em>), dated January 3,
      1894, i.e., written a year and a half before his death, Engels
      wrote that in all his articles he used the word &#8220;Communist&#8221;, and
      not "Social-Democrat", because at that time the Proudhonists in
      France and the 

      Lassalleans<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw08" name="bk08">[8]</a></sup>

      in Germany called themselves Social-Democrats.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "...  For Marx and myself," continued Engels, "it was therefore
      absolutely impossible to use such a loose term to characterize
      our special point of view.  Today things are different, and the
      word ["Social-Democrat"] may perhaps pass muster [mag
      passieren], inexact [unpassend, unsuitable] though it still is
      for a party whose economic programme is not merely socialist in
      general, but downright communist, and whose ultimate political
      aim is to overcome the whole state and, consequently, democracy
      as well.  The names of <em>real</em> political parties, however,
      are never wholly appropriate; the party develops while the name

      stays."<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw09" name="bk09">[9]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      The dialectician Engels remained true to dialectics to the end
      of his days.  Marx and I, he said, had a splendid,
      scientifically exact name for the party, but there was no real
      party, i.e., no mass proletarian party.  Now (at the end of the
      19th century) there was a real party, but its name was
      scientifically wrong.  Never mind, it would "pass muster", so
      long as the party developed, so long as the scientific in
      accuracy of the name was not hidden from it and did not hinder
      its development on the right direction!
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps some wit would console us Bolsheviks in the manner of
      Engels: we have a real party, it is developing splendidly; even
      such a meaningless and ugly term as &#8220;Bolshevik&#8221; will "pass
      muster", although it expresses nothing whatever but the purely
      accidental fact that at the Brussels-London Congress of 1903 we
      were in the majority.  Perhaps now that the persecution of our
      Party by republicans and &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; petty-bourgeois
      democrats in July and August has earned the name &#8220;Bolshevik&#8221;
      such universal respect, now that, in addition, this persecution
      marks the tremendous historical progress our Party has made in
      its real development--perhaps now even I might hesitate to
      insist on the suggestion I made in April to change the name of
      our Party.  Perhaps I would propose a &#8220;compromise&#8221; to my
      comrades, namely, to call ourselves the Communist Party, but to
      retain the word &#8220;Bolshevik&#8221; in brackets.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the question of the name of the Party is incomparably less
      important than the question of the attitude of the revolutionary
      proletariat to the state.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the usual argument about the state, the mistake is constantly
      made against which Engels warned and which we have in passing
      indicated above, namely, it is constantly forgotten that the
      abolition of the state means also the abolition of democracy;
      that the withering away of the state means the withering away of
      democracy.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first sight this assertion seems exceedingly strange and
      incomprehensible; indeed, someone may even suspect us of
      expecting the advent of a system of society in which the
      principle of subordination of the minority to the majority will
      not be observed--for democracy means the recognition of this
      very principle.
    </p>

    <p>
      No, democracy is not identical with the subordination of the
      minority to the majority.  Democracy is a state which recognizes
      the subordination of the minority to the majority, i.e., an
      organization for the systematic use of force by one class
      against another, by one section of the population against
      another.
    </p>

    <p>
      We set ourselves the ultimate aim of abolishing the state, i.e.,
      all organized and systematic violence, all use of violence
      against people in general.  We do not expect the advent of a
      system of society in which the principle of subordination of the
      minority to the majority will not be observed.  In striving for
      socialism, however, we are convinced that it will develop into
      communism and, therefore, that the need for violence against
      people in general, for the subordination of one man to another,
      and of one section of the population to another, will vanish
      altogether since people will become accustomed to observing the
      elementary conditions of social life without violence and
      without subordination.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to emphasize this element of habit, Engels speaks of a
      new generation, "reared in new, free social conditions", which
      will "be able to discard the entire lumber of the state"--of
      any state, including the democratic-republican state.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to explain this, it is necessary to analyze he economic basis
      of the withering away of the state.

      Erfurt Programme--the programme adopted by the German Social-Democratic
      Party at its Erfurt Congress in October 1891. A step forward compared with
      the Gotha Programme (1875), it was based on Marx's doctrine of the
      inevitable downfall of the capitalist mode of production and its replacement
      by the socialist mode. It stressed the necessity for the working class to
      wage a political struggle, pointed out the party's role as the leader of
      that struggle, and so on. But it also made serious concessions to
      opportunism. Engels criticised the original draft of the pro- gramme in
      detail in his work A Critique of the Draft Social- Democratic Programme of
      1891 It was virtually a critique of the opportunism of the Second
      International as a whole. But the German Social-Democratic leaders concealed
      Engels's critique from the rank and file, and disregarded his highly
      important comments in drawing up the final text of the programme. Lenin
      considered the fact that the Erfurt Programme said nothing about the
      dictatorship of the proletariat to be its chief defect and a cowardly
      concession to opportunism.

      The Anti-Socialist Law (Exceptional Law Against the Socialists) was
      enacted in Germany by the Bismarck government in 1878 to combat the
      working-class and socialist movement. Under this law, all Social-Democratic
      Party organisations, all mass organisa- tions of the workers, and the
      working-class press were banned, socialist literature was confiscated and
      the Social-Democrats were persecuted, to the point of banishment. These
      repressive measures did not, however, break the Social-Democratic Party,
      which readjusted itself to illegal conditions. Der Sozial-Demokrat, the
      party's Central Organ, was published abroad and party congresses were held
      at regular intervals (1880, 1883 and 1887). In Germany herself, the
      Social-Democratic organisations and groups were coming back to life
      underground, an illegal Central Committee leading their activities. Besides,
      the Party widely used legal opportunities to establish closer links with the
      working people, and its influence was growing steadily. At the Reichstag
      elections in 1890, it polled three times as many votes as in 1878. Marx and
      Engels did much to help the Social-Democrats. In 1890 popular pressure and
      the growing working-class movement led to the annulment of the
      Anti-Socialist Law.

      The Los-von-Kirche-Bewegung (the "Leave-the-Church" movement), or
      Kirchenaustrittsbewegung (Movement to Secede from the Church) assumed a vast
      scale in Germany before the First World War. In January 1914 Neue Zeit
      began, with the revisionist Paul Gdhre's article "Kirchenaustrittsbewegung
      und Sozialdemokratie" ("The Movement to Secede from the Church and
      Social-Democracy"), to discuss the attitude of the German Social-Democratic
      Party to the movement. During that discussion prominent German
      Social-Democratic leaders failed to rebuff G&ouml;hre, who affirmed that the
      party should remain neutral towards the Movement to Secede from the Church
      and forbid its members to engage in propaganda against religion and the
      Church on behalf of the party.

      Lassalleans--supporters of the German petty-bourgeois socialist
      Ferdinand Lassalle, members of the General Association of German Workers
      founded at the Congress of Workers' Organisations, held in Leipzig in 1863,
      to counterbalance the bourgeois progressists who were trying to gain
      influence over the working class. The first President of the Association was
      Lassalle, who formulated its programme and the fundamentals of its tactics.
      The Association's political programme was declared to be the struggle for
      universal suffrage, and its economic programme, the struggle for workers'
      production associations, to be subsidised by the state. In their practical
      activities, Lassalle and his followers adapted themselves to the hegemony of
      Prussia and supported the Great Power policy of Bismarck. "Objectively,"
      wrote Engels to Marx on January 27, 1865, "this was a base action and a
      betrayal of the whole working-class movement to the Prussians." Marx and
      Engels frequently and sharply criticised the theory, tactics, and
      organisational principles of the Lassalleans as an opportunist trend in the
      German working-class movement.
