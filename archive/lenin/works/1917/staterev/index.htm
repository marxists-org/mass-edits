    <p class="fst">
      Lenin wrote <em>The State and Revolution</em> in August and
      September 1917, when he was in hiding from persecution of the <a href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/p/r.htm#provisional-government">Provisional
      Government</a>. The need for such a theoretical work as this was
      mentioned by Lenin in the second half of 1916. It was then that
      he wrote his note on "The Youth International", in which he
      criticised Bukharin's position on the question of the state and
      promised to write a detailed article on what he thought to be
      the Marxist attitude to the state. In a letter to
      A. M. Kollontai on February 17 (N.S.), 1917, he said that he had
      almost got ready material on that question  . This material was written in a small
      blue-covered notebook headed "Marxism on the State". In it Lenin
      had collected quotations from the works of Marx and Engels, and
      extracts from the books by Kautsky, Pannekoek and Bernstein with
      his own critical notes, conclusions and generalisations.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lenin left Switzerland for Russia in April 1917, he feared
      arrest by the Provisional Government and left the manuscript of
      "Marxism on the State" behind &#8212; as it would have been
      destroyed had he been caught. When in hiding after the July
      events, Lenin wrote in a note:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "Entre nous, if I am knocked off, I ask you to publish my
      notebook 'Marxism on the State' (it got held up in
      Stockholm). It is bound in a blue cover. All the quotations from
      Marx and Engels are collected there, also those from Kautsky
      against Pannekoek. There are a number of remarks, notes and
      formulas. I think a week's work would be enough to publish it. I
      consider it important because not only Plekhanov, but Kautsky,
      too, is <em>confused</em>...." When Lenin received his notebook
      from Stockholm, he used the material he had collected as a basis
      for his book <em>The State and Revolution</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Lenin's plan, <em>The State and Revolution</em> was
      to have consisted of seven chapters, but he did not write the
      seventh, "The Experience of the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and
      1917", and only a detailed plan has remained. In a note to the
      publisher Lenin wrote that if he "was too slow in competing
      this, the seventh chapter, or should it turn out to be too
      bulky, the first six chapters should be published separately as
      Book One."
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally, the name F.F. Ivanovsky is shown on the first page
      of the notebook manuscript as that of the author. Lenin intended
      to publish the book under that pseudonym, otherwise the
      Provisional Government would have confiscated it for his name
      alone. The book, however, was not printed until 1918, when there
      was no longer any need for the pseudonym. The second edition
      appeared in 1919; in this revision Lenin added to <a href="ch02.htm">Chapter II</a> a new section "<a href="ch02.htm#s3">The Presentation of the Question by Marx in
      1852</a>".
