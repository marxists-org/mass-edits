    <h4>
      Preface to the First Edition
    </h4>

    <p>
      The question of the state is now acquiring particular importance
      both in theory and in practical politics.  The imperialist war
      has immensely accelerated and intensified the process of
      transformation of monopoly capitalism into state-monopoly
      capitalism.  The monstrous oppression of the working people by
      the state, which is merging more and more with the all-powerful
      capitalist associations, is becoming increasingly monstrous.
      The advanced countries - we mean their hinterland - are becoming
      military convict prisons for the workers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The unprecedented horrors and miseries of the protracted war are
      making the people's position unbearable and increasing their
      anger.  The world proletarian revolution is clearly maturing.
      The question of its relation to the state is acquiring practical
      importance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The elements of opportunism that accumulated over the decades of
      comparatively peaceful development have given rise to the trend
      of social-chauvinism which dominated the official socialist
      parties throughout the world.  This trend - socialism in words
      and chauvinism in deeds (Plekhanov, Potresov, Breshkovskaya,
      Rubanovich, and, in a slightly veiled form, Tsereteli, Chernov
      and Co.  in Russia; Scheidemann.  Legien, David and others in
      Germany; Renaudel, Guesde and Vandervelde in France and Belgium;
      Hyndman and the 

      Fabians<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw01" name="bk01">[1]</a></sup>

      in England, etc., etc.) - is conspicuous
      for the base, servile adaptation of the "leaders of socialism"
      to the interests not only of "their" national bourgeoisie, but
      of "their" state, for the majority of the so-called Great Powers
      have long been exploiting and enslaving a whole number of small
      and weak nations.  And the imperialist war is a war for the
      division and redivision of this kind of booty.  The struggle to
      free the working people from the influence of the bourgeoisie in
      general, and of the imperialist bourgeoisie in particular, is
      impossible without a struggle against opportunist prejudices
      concerning the "state".
    </p>

    <p>
      First of all we examine the theory of Marx and Engels of the
      state, and dwell in particular detail on those aspects of this
      theory which are ignored or have been distorted by the
      opportunists.  Then we deal specially with the one who is
      chiefly responsible for these distortions, Karl Kautsky, the
      best-known leader of the Second International (1889-1914), which
      has met with such miserable bankruptcy in the present war.
      Lastly, we sum up the main results of the experience of the
      Russian revolutions of 1905 and particularly of 1917.
      Apparently, the latter is now (early August 1917) completing the
      first stage of its development; but this revolution as a whole
      can only be understood as a link in a chain of socialist
      proletarian revolutions being caused by the imperialist war.
      The question of the relation of the socialist proletarian
      revolution to the state, therefore, is acquiring not only
      practical political importance, but also the significance of a
      most urgent problem of the day, the problem of explaining to the
      masses what they will have to do before long to free themselves
      from capitalist tyranny.

      Fabians--members of the Fabian Society, a British reformist organisation
      founded in 1884. It grouped mostly bourgeois intellectuals--scholars,
      writers, politicians--including Sydney and Beatrice Webb, Ramsay MacDonald
      and Bernard Shaw. The Fabians denied the necessity for the proletarian class
      struggle and for the socialist revolution. They contended that the
      transition from capitalism to socialism could only be effected through minor
      social reforms, that is, gradual changes. Lenin described Fabian ideas as
      "an extremely opportunist trend" (see present edition, Vol. 13, p. 358).

    </p><p>
      In 1900 the Fabian Society became part of the British Labour Party. "Fabian
      socialism" is a source of the Labour Party's ideology.

    </p><p>
      During the First World War the Fabians took a social-chauvinist stand. For
      Lenin's characterisation of Fabian principles, see Lenin's article "British
      Pacifism and the British Dislike of Theory" (present edition, Vol. 21, pp.
      260-65).
