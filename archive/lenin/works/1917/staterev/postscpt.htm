    <h4>
      PostScript to the First Edition
    </h4>

    <p class="fst">
      This pamphlet was written in August and September 1917.  I had
      already drawn up the plan for the next, the seventh chapter,
      "The Experience of the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917".
      Apart from the title, however, I had no time to write a single
      line of the chapter; I was "interrupted" by a political 
      crisis--the eve of the October revolution of 1917.  Such an
      "interruption" can only be welcomed; but the writing of the
      second part of this pamphlet ("The Experience of the Russian
      Revolutions of 1905 and 1917") will probably have to be put off
      for a long time.  It is more pleasant and useful to go through
      the "experience of revolution" than to write about it.
