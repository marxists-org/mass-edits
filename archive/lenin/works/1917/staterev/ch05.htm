      Marx explains this question most thoroughly in his <a
	href="../../../../marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm">Critique
	of the Gotha Programme</a> (letter to Bracke, May 5, 1875,
	which was not published until 1891 when it was printed in
	<em>Neue Zeit</em>, vol. IX, 1, and which has appeared in
	Russian in a special edition).  The polemical part of this
	remarkable work, which contains a criticism of Lassalleanism,
	has, so to speak, overshadowed its positive part, namely, the
	analysis of the connection between the development of
	communism and the withering away of the state.
    </p>


    <h4>
      <a name="s1"></a>

      1. Presentation of the Question by Marx
    </h4>
 

    <p>
      From a superficial comparison of Marx's letter to Bracke of May
      5, 1875, with Engels' letter to Bebel of March 28, 1875, which
      we examined above, it might appear that Marx was much more of a
      "champion of the state" than Engels, and that the difference of
      opinion between the two writers on the question of the state was
      very considerable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Engels suggested to Bebel that all chatter about the state be
      dropped altogether, that the word &#8220;state&#8221; be eliminated from the
      programme altogether and the word &#8220;community&#8221; substituted for
      it.  Engels even declared that the Commune was long a state in
      the proper sense of the word.  Yet Marx even spoke of the
      "future state in communist society", i.e., he would seem to
      recognize the need for the state even under communism.
    </p>

    <p>
      But such a view would be fundamentally wrong.  A closer
      examination shows that Marx's and Engels' views on the state and
      its withering away were completely identical, and that Marx's
      expression quoted above refers to the state in the process of
      withering away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clearly, there can be no question of specifying the moment of
      the future "withering away", the more so since it will obviously
      be a lengthy process.  The apparent difference between Marx and
      Engels is due to the fact that they dealth with different
      subjects and pursued different aims.  Engels set out to show
      Bebel graphically, sharply, and in broad outline the utter
      absurdity of the current prejudices concerning the state (shared
      to no small degree by Lassalle).  Marx only touched upon this
      question in passing, being interested in another subject,
      namely, the development of communist society.
    </p>

    <p>
      The whole theory of Marx is the application of the theory of
      development--in its most consistent, complete, considered and pithy
      form--to modern capitalism.  Naturally, Marx was faced with the
      problem of applying this theory both to the forthcoming collapse of
      capitalism and to the future development of future communism.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the basis of what facts, then, can the question of the future
      development of future communism be dealt with?
    </p>

    <p>
      On the basis of the fact that it has its origin in capitalism,
      that it develops historically from capitalism, that it is the
      result of the action of a social force to which capitalism gave
      birth.  There is no trace of an attempt on Marx's part to make
      up a utopia, to indulge in idle guess-work about what cannot be
      known.  Marx treated the question of communism in the same way
      as a naturalist would treat the question of the development of,
      say, a new biological variety, once he knew that it had
      originated in such and such a way and was changing in such and
      such a definite direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      To begin with, Marx brushed aside the confusion the Gotha Programme
      brought into the question of the relationship between state and society. 
      He wrote:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "'Present-day society' is capitalist society, which exists in
      all civilized countries, being more or less free from medieval
      admixture, more or less modified by the particular historical
      development of each country, more or less developed.  On the
      other hand, the 'present-day state' changes with a country's
      frontier.  It is different in the Prusso-German Empire from what
      it is in Switzerland, and different in England from what it is
      in the United States.  'The present-day state' is, therefore, a
      fiction.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "Nevertheless, the different states of the different civilized
      countries, in spite of their motley diversity of form, all have
      this in common, that they are based on modern bourgeois society,
      only one more or less capitalistically developed.  The have,
      therefore, also certain essential characteristics in common.  In
      this sense it is possible to speak of the 'present-day state',
      in contrast with the future, in which its present root,
      bourgeois society, will have died off.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "The question then arises: what transformation will the state
      undergo in communist society? In other words, what social
      functions will remain in existence there that are analogous to
      present state functions? This question can only be answered
      scientifically, and one does not get a flea-hop nearer to the
      problem by a thousandfold combination of the word people with
      the word 

      state."<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw01" name="bk01">[1]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      After thus ridiculing all talk about a "people's state", Marx
      formulated the question and gave warning, as it were, that those
      seeking a scientific answer to it should use only
      firmly-established scientific data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first fact that has been established most accurately by the
      whole theory of development, by science as a whole--a fact that
      was ignored by the utopians, and is ignored by the present-day
      opportunists, who are afraid of the socialist revolution--is
      that, historically, there must undoubtedly be a special stage,
      or a special phase, of transition from capitalism to communism.
    </p>


    <h4>
      <a name="s2"></a>

      2. The Transition from Capitalism to Communism
    </h4>

        
    <p>
      Marx continued:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the
      revolutionary transformation of the one into the other.
      Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in
      which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary
      dictatorship of the proletariat."
    </p>

    <p>
      Marx bases this conclusion on an analysis of the role played by
      the proletariat in modern capitalist society, on the data
      concerning the development of this society, and on the
      irreconcilability of the antagonistic interests of the
      proletariat and the bourgeoisie.
    </p>

    <p>
      Previously the question was put as follows: to achieve its emancipation,
      the proletariat must overthrow the bourgeoisie, win political power and
      establish its revolutionary dictatorship. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Now the question is put somewhat differently: the transition
      from capitalist society--which is developing towards
      communism--to communist society is impossible without a
      "political
      transition period", and the state in this period can only be the
      revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.
    </p>

    <p>
      What, then, is the relation of this dictatorship to democracy?
    </p>

    <p>
      We have seen that the <a href="../../../../marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm">Communist
      Manifesto</a> simply places side by side the two concepts: "to
      raise the proletariat to the position of the ruling class" and
      "to win the battle of democracy".  On the basis of all that has
      been said above, it is possible to determine more precisely how
      democracy changes in the transition from capitalism to
      communism.
    </p>

    <p>
      In capitalist society, providing it develops under the most
      favourable conditions, we have a more or less complete democracy
      in the democratic republic.  But this democracy is always hemmed
      in by the narrow limits set by capitalist exploitation, and
      consequently always remains, in effect, a democracy for the
      minority, only for the propertied classes, only for the rich.
      Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as
      it was in the ancient Greek republics: freedom for the
      slave-owners.  Owing to the conditions of capitalist
      exploitation, the modern wage slaves are so crushed by want and
      poverty that "they cannot be bothered with democracy", "cannot
      be bothered with politics"; in the ordinary, peaceful course of
      events, the majority of the population is debarred from
      participation in public and political life.
    </p>

    <p>
      The correctness of this statement is perhaps most clearly
      confirmed by Germany, because constitutional legality steadily
      endured there for a remarkably long time--nearly half a century
      (1871-1914)--and during this period the Social-Democrats were
      able to achieve far more than in other countries in the way of
      "utilizing legality", and organized a larger proportion of the
      workers into a political party than anywhere else in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      What is this largest proportion of politically conscious and
      active wage slaves that has so far been recorded in capitalist
      society? One million members of the Social-Democratic Party -
      out of 15,000,000 wage-workers! Three million organized in trade
      unions--out of 15,000,000!
    </p>

    <p>
      Democracy for an insignificant minority, democracy for the
      rich--that is the democracy of capitalist society.  If we look
      more
      closely into the machinery of capitalist democracy, we see
      everywhere, in the &#8220;petty&#8221;--supposedly petty--details of the
      suffrage (residential qualifications, exclusion of women, etc.),
      in the technique of the representative institutions, in the
      actual obstacles to the right of assembly (public buildings are
      not for &#8220;paupers&#8221;!), in the purely capitalist organization of
      the daily press, etc., etc.,--we see restriction after
      restriction upon democracy.  These restrictions, exceptions,
      exclusions, obstacles for the poor seem slight, especially in
      the eyes of one who has never known want himself and has never
      been inclose contact with the oppressed classes in their mass
      life (and nine out of 10, if not 99 out of 100, bourgeois
      publicists and politicians come under this category); but in
      their sum total these restrictions exclude and squeeze out the
      poor from politics, from active participation in democracy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Marx grasped this essence of capitalist democracy splendidly
      when, in analyzing the experience of the Commune, he said that
      the oppressed are allowed once every few years to decide which
      particular representatives of the oppressing class shall
      represent and repress them in parliament!
    </p>

    <p>
      But from this capitalist democracy--that is inevitably narrow
      and stealthily pushes aside the poor, and is therefore
      hypocritical and false through and through--forward development
      does not proceed simply, directly and smoothly, towards "greater
      and greater democracy", as the liberal professors and
      petty-bourgeois opportunists would have us believe.  No, forward
      development, i.e., development towards communism, proceeds
      through the dictatorship of the proletariat, and cannot do
      otherwise, for the resistance of the capitalist exploiters
      cannot be broken by anyone else or in any other way.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the dictatorship of the proletariat, i.e., the organization
      of the vanguard of the oppressed as the ruling class for the
      purpose of suppressing the oppressors, cannot result merely in
      an expansion of democracy.  Simultaneously with an immense
      expansion of democracy, which for the first time becomes
      democracy for the poor, democracy for the people, and not
      democracy for the money-bags, the dictatorship of the
      proletariat imposes a series of restrictions on the freedom of
      the oppressors, the exploiters, the capitalists.  We must
      suppress them in order to free humanity from wage slavery, their
      resistance must be crushed by force; it is clear that there is
      no freedom and no democracy where there is suppression and where
      there is violence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Engels expressed this splendidly in his letter to Bebel when he
      said, as the reader will remember, that "the proletariat needs
      the state, not in the interests of freedom but in order to hold
      down its adversaries, and as soon as it becomes possible to
      speak of freedom the state as such ceases to exist".
    </p>

    <p>
      Democracy for the vast majority of the people, and suppression
      by force, i.e., exclusion from democracy, of the exploiters and
      oppressors of the people--this is the change democracy
      undergoes during the transition from capitalism to communism.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only in communist society, when the resistance of the
      capitalists have disappeared, when there are no classes (i.e.,
      when there is no distinction between the members of society as
      regards their relation to the social means of production), only
      then "the state...  ceases to exist", and "it becomes possible
      to speak of freedom".  Only then will a truly complete democracy
      become possible and be realized, a democracy without any
      exceptions whatever.  And only then will democracy begin to
      wither away, owing to the simple fact that, freed from
      capitalist slavery, from the untold horrors, savagery,
      absurdities, and infamies of capitalist exploitation, people
      will gradually become accustomed to observing the elementary
      rules of social intercourse that have been known for centuries
      and repeated for thousands of years in all copy-book maxims.
      They will become accustomed to observing them without force,
      without coercion, without subordination, without the special
      apparatus for coercion called the state.
    </p>

    <p>
      The expression "the state withers away" is very well-chosen, for
      it indicates both the gradual and the spontaneous nature of the
      process.  Only habit can, and undoubtedly will, have such an
      effect; for we see around us on millions of occassions how
      readily people become accustomed to observing the necessary
      rules of social intercourse when there is no exploitation, when
      there is nothing that arouses indignation, evokes protest and
      revolt, and creates the need for suppression.
    </p>

    <p>
      And so in capitalist society we have a democracy that is
      curtailed, wretched, false, a democracy only for the rich, for
      the minority.  The dictatorship of the proletariat, the period
      of transition to communism, will for the first time create
      democracy for the people, for the majority, along with the
      necessary suppression of the exploiters, of the minority.
      Communism alone is capable of providing really complete
      democracy, and the more complete it is, the sooner it will
      become unnecessary and wither away of its own accord.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other words, under capitalism we have the state in the proper
      sense of the word, that is, a special machine for the
      suppression of one class by another, and, what is more, of the
      majority by the minority.  Naturally, to be successful, such an
      undertaking as the systematic suppression of the exploited
      majority by the exploiting minority calls for the utmost
      ferocity and savagery in the matter of suppressing, it calls for
      seas of blood, through which mankind is actually wading its way
      in slavery, serfdom and wage labor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, during the transition from capitalism to communism
      suppression is still necessary, but it is now the suppression of
      the exploiting minority by the exploited majority.  A special
      apparatus, a special machine for suppression, the &#8220;state&#8221;, is
      still necessary, but this is now a transitional state.  It is no
      longer a state in the proper sense of the word; for the
      suppression of the minority of exploiters by the majority of the
      wage slaves of yesterday is comparatively so easy, simple and
      natural a task that it will entail far less bloodshed than the
      suppression of the risings of slaves, serfs or wage-laborers,
      and it will cost mankind far less.  And it is compatible with
      the extension of democracy to such an overwhelming majority of
      the population that the need for a special machine of
      suppression will begin to disappear.  Naturally, the exploiters
      are unable to suppress the people without a highly complex
      machine for performing this task, but the people can suppress
      the exploiters even with a very simple &#8220;machine&#8221;, almost without
      a &#8220;machine&#8221;, without a special apparatus, by the simple
      organization of the armed people (such as the Soviets of
      Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, we would remark, running
      ahead).
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, only communism makes the state absolutely unnecessary,
      for there is nobody to be suppressed--&#8220;nobody&#8221; in the sense of
      a class, of a systematic struggle against a definite section of
      the population.  We are not utopians, and do not in the least
      deny the possibility and inevitability of excesses on the part
      of <em>individual persons</em>, or the need to stop such
      excesses.  In the first place, however, no special machine, no
      special apparatus of suppression, is needed for this: this will
      be done by the armed people themselves, as simply and as readily
      as any crowd of civilized people, even in modern society,
      interferes to put a stop to a scuffle or to prevent a woman from
      being assaulted.  And, secondly, we know that the fundamental
      social cause of excesses, which consist in the violation of the
      rules of social intercourse, is the exploitation of the people,
      their want and their poverty.  With the removal of this chief
      cause, excesses will inevitably begin to "wither away".  We do
      not know how quickly and in what succession, but we do know they
      will wither away.  With their withering away the state will also
      wither away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without building utopias, Marx defined more fully what can be defined
      now regarding this future, namely, the differences between the lower and
      higher phases (levels, stages) of communist society. 
    </p>




    <h4>
      <a name="s3"></a>

      3. The First Phase of Communist Society
    </h4>

    <p>
      In the <em>Critique of the Gotha Programme</em>, Marx goes into
      detail to disprove Lassalle's idea that under socialism the
      worker will receive the &#8220;undiminished&#8221; or "full product of his
      labor".  Marx shows that from the whole of the social labor of
      society there must be deducted a reserve fund, a fund for the
      expansion of production, a fund for the replacement of the "wear
      and tear" of machinery, and so on.  Then, from the means of
      consumption must be deducted a fund for administrative expenses,
      for schools, hospitals, old people's homes, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of Lassalle's hazy, obscure, general phrase ("the full
      product of his labor to the worker"), Marx makes a sober
      estimate of exactly how socialist society will have to manage
      its affairs.  Marx proceeds to make a concrete analysis of the
      conditions of life of a society in which there will be no
      capitalism, and says:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "What we have to deal with here [in analyzing the programme of
      the workers' party] is a communist society, not as it has
      developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as
      it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every
      respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still
      stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb
      it comes."
    </p>

    <p>
      It is this communist society, which has just emerged into the
      light of day out of the womb of capitalism and which is in every
      respect stamped with the birthmarks of the old society, that
      Marx terms the &#8220;first&#8221;, or lower, phase of communist society.
    </p>

    <p>
      The means of production are no longer the private property of
      individuals.  The means of production belong to the whole of
      society.  Every member of society, performing a certain part of
      the socially-necessary work, receives a certificate from society
      to the effect that he has done a certain amount of work.  And
      with this certificate he receives from the public store of
      consumer goods a corresponding quantity of products.  After a
      deduction is made of the amount of labor which goes to the
      public fund, every worker, therefore, receives from society as
      much as he has given to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Equality&#8221; apparently reigns supreme. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But when Lassalle, having in view such a social order (usually
      called socialism, but termed by Marx the first phase of
      communism), says that this is "equitable distribution", that
      this is "the equal right of all to an equal product of labor",
      Lassalle is mistaken and Marx exposes the mistake.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Hence, the equal right," says Marx, in this case still
      certainly conforms to "bourgeois law", which,like all law,
      implies inequality.  All law is an application of an equal
      measure to different people who in fact are not alike, are not
      equal to one another.  That is why the "equal right" is
      violation of equality and an injustice.  In fact, everyone,
      having performed as much social labor as another, receives an
      equal share of the social product (after the above-mentioned
      deductions).
    </p>

    <p>
      But people are not alike: one is strong, another is weak; one is
      married, another is not; one has more children, another has
      less, and so on.  And the conclusion Marx draws is:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "... With an equal performance of labor, and hence an equal
      share in the social consumption fund, one will in fact receive
      more than another, one will be richer than another, and so on.
      To avoid all these defects, the right instead of being equal
      would have to be unequal."
    </p>

    <p>
      The first phase of communism, therefore, cannot yet provide
      justice and equality; differences, and unjust differences, in
      wealth will still persist, but the exploitation of man by man
      will have become impossible because it will be impossible to
      seize the means of production--the factories, machines, land,
      etc.--and make them private property.  In smashing Lassalle's
      petty-bourgeois, vague phrases about &#8220;equality&#8221; and &#8220;justice&#8221; in
      general, Marx shows the course of development of communist
      society, which is compelled to abolish at first only the
      &#8220;injustice&#8221; of the means of production seized by individuals,
      and which is unable at once to eliminate the other injustice,
      which consists in the distribution of consumer goods "according
      to the amount of labor performed" (and not according to needs).
    </p>

    <p>
      The vulgar economists, including the bourgeois professors and
      &#8220;our&#8221; Tugan, constantly reproach the socialists with forgetting
      the inequality of people and with &#8220;dreaming&#8221; of eliminating this
      inequality.  Such a reproach, as we see, only proves the extreme
      ignorance of the bourgeois ideologists.
    </p>

    <p>
      Marx not only most scrupulously takes account of the inevitable
      inequality of men, but he also takes into account the fact that
      the mere conversion of the means of production into the common
      property of the whole society (commonly called &#8220;socialism&#8221;) does
      not remove the defects of distribution and the inequality of
      "bourgeois laws" which continues to prevail so long as products
      are divided "according to the amount of labor performed".
      Continuing, Marx says:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "But these defects are inevitable in the first phase of
      communist society as it is when it has just emerged, after
      prolonged birth pangs, from capitalist society.  Law can never
      be higher than the economic structure of society and its
      cultural development conditioned thereby."
    </p>

    <p>
      And so, in the first phase of communist society (usually called
      socialism) "bourgeois law" is not abolished in its entirety, but
      only in part, only in proportion to the economic revolution so
      far attained, i.e., only in respect of the means of production.
      "Bourgeois law" recognizes them as the private property of
      individuals.  Socialism converts them into common property.  To
      that extent--and to that extent alone--"bourgeois law"
      disappears.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, it persists as far as its other part is concerned; it
      persists in the capacity of regulator (determining factor) in
      the distribution of products and the allotment of labor among
      the members of society.  The socialist principle, "He who does
      not work shall not eat", is already realized; the other
      socialist principle, "An equal amount of products for an equal
      amount of labor", is also already realized.  But this is not yet
      communism, and it does not yet abolish "bourgeois law", which
      gives unequal individuals, in return for unequal (really
      unequal) amounts of labor, equal amounts of products.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a &#8220;defect&#8221;, says Marx, but it is unavoidable in the
      first phase of communism; for if we are not to indulge in
      utopianism, we must not think that having overthrown capitalism
      people will at once learn to work for society without any rules
      of law.  Besides, the abolition of capitalism does not
      immediately create the economic prerequisites for such a change.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, there are no other rules than those of "bourgeois law".  To
      this extent, therefore, there still remains the need for a
      state, which, while safeguarding the common ownership of the
      means of production, would safeguard equality in labor and in
      the distribution of products.
    </p>

    <p>
      The state withers away insofar as there are no longer any capitalists,
      any classes, and, consequently, no class can be suppressed. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But the state has not yet completely withered away, since the
      still remains the safeguarding of "bourgeois law", which
      sanctifies actual inequality.  For the state to wither away
      completely, complete communism is necessary.
    </p>

      4. The Higher Phase of Communist Society
    </h4>


    <p>
      Marx continues:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving
      subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and
      with it also the antithesis between mental and physical labor,
      has vanished, after labor has become not only a livelihood but
      life's prime want, after the productive forces have increased
      with the all-round development of the individual, and all the
      springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly--only then
      can the narrow horizon of bourgeois law be left behind in its
      entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each
      according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Only now can we fully appreciate the correctness of Engels'
      remarks mercilessly ridiculing the absurdity of combining the
      words &#8220;freedom&#8221; and &#8220;state&#8221;.  So long as the state exists there
      is no freedom.  When there is freedom, there will be no state.
    </p>

    <p>
      The economic basis for the complete withering away of the state
      is such a high state of development of communism at which the
      antithesis between mental and physical labor disappears, at
      which there consequently disappears one of the principal sources
      of modern social inequality--a source, moreover, which cannot
      on any account be removed immediately by the mere conversion of
      the means of production into public property, by the mere
      <!-- exploitation of the capitalists. -->
      expropriation of the capitalists.
    </p>

    <p>
      This expropriation will make it possible for the productive
      forces to develop to a tremendous extent.  And when we see how
      incredibly capitalism is already retarding this development,
      when we see how much progress could be achieved on the basis of
      the level of technique already attained, we are entitled to say
      with the fullest confidence that the expropriation of the
      capitalists will inevitably result in an enormous development of
      the productive forces of human society.  But how rapidly this
      development will proceed, how soon it will reach the point of
      breaking away from the division of labor, of doing away with the
      antithesis between mental and physical labor, of transforming
      labor into "life's prime want"--we do not and cannot know.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is why we are entitled to speak only of the inevitable
      withering away of the state, emphasizing the protracted nature
      of this process and its dependence upon the rapidity of
      development of the higher phase of communism, and leaving the
      question of the time required for, or the concrete forms of, the
      withering away quite open, because there is no material for
      answering these questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The state will be able to wither away completely when society
      adopts the rule: "From each according to his ability, to each
      according to his needs", i.e., when people have become so
      accustomed to observing the fundamental rules of social
      intercourse and when their labor has become so productive that
      they will voluntarily work according to their ability.  "The
      narrow horizon of bourgeois law", which compels one to calculate
      with the heartlessness of a Shylock whether one has not worked
      half an hour more than anybody else--this narrow horizon will
      then be left behind.  There will then be no need for society, in
      distributing the products, to regulate the quantity to be
      received by each; each will take freely "according to his
      needs".
    </p>

    <p>
      From the bourgeois point of view, it is easy to declare that
      such a social order is "sheer utopia" and to sneer at the
      socialists for promising everyone the right to receive from
      society, without any control over the labor of the individual
      citizen, any quantity of truffles, cars, pianos, etc.  Even to
      this day, most bourgeois &#8220;savants&#8221; confine themselves to
      sneering in this way, thereby betraying both their ignorance and
      their selfish defence of capitalism.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ignorance--for it has never entered the head of any socialist
      to &#8220;promise&#8221; that the higher phase of the development of
      communism will arrive; as for the greatest socialists' forecast
      that it will arrive, it presupposes not the present ordinary run
      of people, who, like the seminary students in Pomyalovsky's

      stories,<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw02" name="bk02">[2]</a></sup>

      are capable of damaging the stocks of public wealth
      "just for fun", and of demanding the impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Until the &#8220;higher&#8221; phase of communism arrives, the socialists
      demand the strictest control by society and by the state over
      the measure of labor and the measure of consumption; but this
      control must start with the expropriation of the capitalists,
      with the establishment of workers' control over the capitalists,
      and must be exercised not by a state of bureaucrats, but by a
      state of armed workers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The selfish defence of capitalism by the bourgeois ideologists
      (and their hangers-on, like the Tseretelis, Chernovs, and Co.)
      consists in that they substitute arguing and talk about the
      distant future for the vital and burning question of present-day
      politics, namely, the expropriation of the capitalists, the
      conversion of all citizens into workers and other employees of
      one huge &#8220;syndicate&#8221;--the whole state--and the complete
      subordination of the entire work of this syndicate to a
      genuinely democratic state, the state of the Soviets of Workers'
      and Soldiers' Deputies.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, when a learned professor, followed by the philistine,
      followed in turn by the Tseretelis and Chernovs, talks of wild
      utopias, of the demagogic promises of the Bolsheviks, of the
      impossibility of &#8220;introducing&#8221; socialism, it is the higher
      stage, or phase, of communism he has in mind, which no one has
      ever promised or even thought to &#8220;introduce&#8221;, because, generally
      speaking, it cannot be &#8220;introduced&#8221;.
    </p>

    <p>
      And this brings us to the question of the scientific distinction
      between socialism and communism which Engels touched on in his
      above-quoted argument about the incorrectness of the name
      "Social-Democrat".  Politically, the distinction between the
      first, or lower, and the higher phase of communism will in time,
      probably, be tremendous.  But it would be ridiculous to
      recognize this distinction now, under capitalism, and only
      individual anarchists, perhaps, could invest it with primary
      importance (if there still are people among the anarchists who
      have learned nothing from the &#8220;Plekhanov&#8221; conversion of the
      Kropotkins, of Grave, Corneliseen, and other &#8220;stars&#8221; of
      anarchism into social- chauvinists or "anarcho-trenchists", as
      Ghe, one of the few anarchists who have still preserved a sense
      of humor and a conscience, has put it).
    </p>

    <p>
      But the scientific distinction between socialism and communism
      is clear.  What is usually called socialism was termed by Marx
      the &#8220;first&#8221;, or lower, phase of communist society.  Insofar as
      the means of production becomes common property, the word
      &#8220;communism&#8221; is also applicable here, providing we do not forget
      that this is not complete communism.  The great significance of
      Marx's explanations is that here, too, he consistently applies
      materialist dialectics, the theory of development, and regards
      communism as something which develops out of capitalism.
      Instead of scholastically invented, &#8220;concocted&#8221; definitions and
      fruitless disputes over words (What is socialism? What is
      communism?), Marx gives an analysis of what might be called the
      stages of the economic maturity of communism.
    </p>

    <p>
      In its first phase, or first stage, communism cannot as yet be
      fully mature economically and entirely free from traditions or
      vestiges of capitalism.  Hence the interesting phenomenon that
      communism in its first phase retains "the narrow horizon of
      bourgeois law".  Of course, bourgeois law in regard to the
      distribution of consumer goods inevitably presupposes the
      existence of the bourgeois state, for law is nothing without an
      apparatus capable of enforcing the observance of the rules of
      law.
    </p>

    <p>
      It follows that under communism there remains for a time not only
      bourgeois law, but even the bourgeois state, without the bourgeoisie!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This may sound like a paradox or simply a dialectical conundrum of
      which Marxism is often accused by people who have not taken the
      slightest trouble to study its extraordinarily profound content.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in fact, remnants of the old, surviving in the new, confront
      us in life at every step, both in nature and in society.  And
      Marx did not arbitrarily insert a scrap of &#8220;bourgeois&#8221; law into
      communism, but indicated what is economically and politically
      inevitable in a society emerging out of the womb of capitalism.
    </p>

    <p>
      Democracy means equality.  The great significance of the
      proletariat's struggle for equality and of equality as a slogan
      will be clear if we correctly interpret it as meaning the
      abolition of classes.  But democracy means only formal equality.
      And as soon as equality is achieved for all members of society
      in relation to ownership of the means of production, that is,
      equality of labor and wages, humanity will inevitably be
      confronted with the question of advancing further from formal
      equality to actual equality, i.e., to the operation of the rule
      "from each according to his ability, to each according to his
      needs".  By what stages, by means of what practical measures
      humanity will proceed to this supreme aim we do not and cannot
      know.  But it is important to realize how infinitely mendacious
      is the ordinary bourgeois conception of socialism as something
      lifeless, rigid, fixed once and for all, whereas in reality only
      socialism will be the beginning of a rapid, genuine, truly mass
      forward movement, embracing first the majority and then the
      whole of the population, in all spheres of public and private
      life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Democracy is of enormous importance to the working class in its
      struggle against the capitalists for its emancipation. But
      democracy is by no means a boundary not to be overstepped; it is
      only one of the stages on the road from feudalism to capitalism,
      and from capitalism to communism.
    </p>

    <p>
      Democracy is a form of the state, it represents, on the one
      hand, the organized, systematic use of force against persons;
      but, on the other hand, it signifies the formal recognition of
      equality of citizens, the equal right of all to determine the
      structure of, and to administer, the state.  This, in turn,
      results in the fact that, at a certain stage in the development
      of democracy, it first welds together the class that wages a
      revolutionary struggle against capitalism--the proletariat, and
      enables it to crush, smash to atoms, wipe off the face of the
      earth the bourgeois, even the republican-bourgeois, state
      machine, the standing army, the police and the bureaucracy and
      to substitute for them a more democratic state machine, but a
      state machine nevertheless, in the shape of armed workers who
      proceed to form a militia involving the entire population.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here "quantity turns into quality": such a degree of democracy
      implies overstepping the boundaries of bourgeois society and
      beginning its socialist reorganization.  If really all take part
      in the administration of the state, capitalism cannot retain its
      hold.  The development of capitalism, in turn, creates the
      preconditions that enable really &#8220;all&#8221; to take part in the
      administration of the state.  Some of these preconditions are:
      universal literacy, which has already been achieved in a number
      of the most advanced capitalist countries, then the "training
      and disciplining" of millions of workers by the huge, complex,
      socialized apparatus of the postal service, railways, big
      factories, large-scale commerce, banking, etc., etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given these economic preconditions, it is quite possible, after
      the overthrow of the capitalists and the bureaucrats, to proceed
      immediately, overnight, to replace them in the control over
      production and distribution, in the work of keeping account of
      labor and products, by the armed workers, by the whole of the
      armed population.  (The question of control and accounting
      should not be confused with the question of the scientifically
      trained staff of engineers, agronomists, and so on.  These
      gentlemen are working today in obedience to the wishes of the
      capitalists and will work even better tomorrow in obedience to
      the wishes of the armed workers.)
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="1"></a>

      Accounting and control--that is <em>mainly</em> what is needed
      for the "smooth working", for the proper functioning, of the
      <em>first phase</em> of communist society. <em>All</em> citizens
      are transformed into hired employees of the state, which
      consists of the armed workers.  <em>All</em> citizens becomes
      employees and workers of a <em>single</em> countrywide state
      &#8220;syndicate&#8221;.  All that is required is that they should work
      equally, do their proper share of work, and get equal pay; the
      accounting and control necessary for this have been
      <em>simplified</em> by capitalism to the utmost and reduced to
      the extraordinarily simple operations--which any literate
      person can perform--of supervising and recording, knowledge of
      the four rules of arithmetic, and issuing appropriate
      receipts.<span class="note"><a name="bk1" href="#1">[1]</a></span>
    </p>

    <p>
      When the <em>majority</em> of the people begin independently and
      everywhere to keep such accounts and exercise such control over
      the capitalists (now converted into employees) and over the
      intellectual gentry who preserve their capitalist habits, this
      control will really become universal, general, and popular; and
      there will be no getting away from it, there will be "nowhere to
      go".
    </p>

    <p>
      The whole of society will have become a single office and a single
      factory, with equality of labor and pay. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But this &#8220;factory&#8221; discipline, which the proletariat, after
      defeating the capitalists, after overthrowing the exploiters,
      will extend to the whole of society, is by no means our ideal,
      or our ultimate goal.  It is only a necessary <em>step</em> for
      thoroughly cleansing society of all the infamies and
      abominations of capitalist exploitation, <em>and for
      further</em> progress.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the moment all members of society, or at least the vast
      majority, have learned to administer the state
      <em>themselves</em>, have taken this work into their own hands,
      have organized control over the insignificant capitalist
      minority, over the gentry who wish to preserve their capitalist
      habits and over the workers who have been thoroughly corrupted
      by capitalism--from this moment the need for government of any
      kind begins to disappear altogether.  The more complete the
      democracy, the nearer the moment when it becomes unnecessary.
      The more democratic the &#8220;state&#8221; which consists of the armed
      workers, and which is "no longer a state in the proper sense of
      the word", the more rapidly <em>every form</em> of state begins
      to wither away.
    </p>

    <p>
      For when <em>all</em> have learned to administer and actually to
      independently administer social production, independently keep
      accounts and exercise control over the parasites, the sons of
      the wealthy, the swindlers and other "guardians of capitalist
      traditions", the escape from this popular accounting and control
      will inevitably become so incredibly difficult, such a rare
      exception, and will probably be accompanied by such swift and
      severe punishment (for the armed workers are practical men and
      not sentimental intellectuals, and they scarcely allow anyone to
      trifle with them), that the <em>necessity</em> of observing the
      simple, fundamental rules of the community will very soon become
      a <em>habit</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then the door will be thrown wide open for the transition from the first
      phase of communist society to its higher phase, and with it to the
      complete withering away of the state.
