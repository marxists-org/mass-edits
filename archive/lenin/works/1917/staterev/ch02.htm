      1. The Eve of Revolution
    </h4>


    <p>
      The first works of mature Marxism &#8212; <a href="../../../../marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/index.htm">The
      Poverty of Philosophy</a> and the <a href="../../../../marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm">Communist
      Manifesto</a> &#8212; appeared just on the eve of the revolution
      of 1848.  For this reason, in addition to presenting the general
      principles of Marxism, they reflect to a certain degree the
      concrete revolutionary situation of the time.  It will,
      therefore, be more expedient, perhaps, to examine what the
      authors of these works said about the state immediately before
      they drew conclusions from the experience of the years 1848-51.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <em>The Poverty of Philosophy</em>, Marx wrote:
    </p>
    
    <p class="quote">
     "The working class, in the course of development, will substitute
     for the old bourgeois society an association which will preclude
     classes and their antagonism, and there will be no more political
     power groups, since the political power is precisely the official
     expression of class antagonism in bourgeois society."

      (p.182, German edition, 

      1885)<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw01" name="bk01">[1]</a></sup>

    </p>

    <p>
      It is instructive to compare this general exposition of the idea
      of the state disappearing after the abolition of classes with
      the exposition contained in the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>,
      written by Marx and Engels a few months later--in November
      1847, to be exact:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "... In depicting the most general phases of the development of
      the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war,
      raging within existing society up to the point where that war
      breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow
      of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the
      proletariat....
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "... We have seen above that the first step in the revolution by
      the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of the
      ruling class to win the battle of democracy. 
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
     "The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by
     degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all
     instruments of production in the hands of the state, i.e., of the
     proletariat organized as the ruling class; and to increase the
     total productive forces as rapidly as possible."

      (pp.31 and 37, seventh German edition, 

      1906)<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw02" name="bk02">[2]</a></sup>

    </p>

    <p>
      Here we have a formulation of one of the most remarkable and
      most important ideas of Marxism on the subject of the state,
      namely, the idea of the "dictatorship of the proletariat" (as
      Marx and Engels began to call it after the Paris Commune); and,
      also, a highly interesting definition of the state, which is
      also one of the "forgotten words" of Marxism: "the state, i.e.,
      the proletariat organized as the ruling class."
    </p>

    <p>
      This definition of the state has never been explained in the
      prevailing propaganda and agitation literature of the official
      Social-Democratic parties.  More than that, it has been
      deliberately ignored, for it is absolutely irreconcilable with
      reformism, and is a slap in the face for the common opportunist
      prejudices and philistine illusions about the "peaceful
      development of democracy".
    </p>

    <p>
      The proletariat needs the state &#8212; this is repeated by all
      the opportunists, social-chauvinists and Kautskyites, who assure
      us that this is what Marx taught.  But they &#8220;forget&#8221; to add
      that, in the first place, according to Marx, the proletariat
      needs only a state which is withering away, i.e., a state so
      constituted that it begins to wither away immediately, and
      cannot but wither away.  And, secondly, the working people need
      a "state, i.e., the proletariat organized as the ruling class".
    </p>

    <p>
      The state is a special organization of force: it is an
      organization of violence for the suppression of some class.
      What class must the proletariat suppress? Naturally, only the
      exploiting class, i.e., the bourgeoisie.  The working people
      need the state only to suppress the resistance of the
      exploiters, and only the proletariat can direct this
      suppression, can carry it out.  For the proletariat is the only
      class that is consistently revolutionary, the only class that
      can unite all the working and exploited people in the struggle
      against the bourgeoisie, in completely removing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The exploiting classes need political rule to maintain
      exploitation, i.e., in the selfish interests of an insignificant
      minority against the vast majority of all people.  The exploited
      classes need political rule in order to completely abolish all
      exploitation, i.e., in the interests of the vast majority of the
      people, and against the insignificant minority consisting of the
      modern slave-owners &#8212; the landowners and capitalists.
    </p>

    <p>
      The petty-bourgeois democrats, those sham socialists who
      replaced the class struggle by dreams of class harmony, even
      pictured the socialist transformation in a dreamy fashion &#8212;
      not as the overthrow of the rule of the exploiting class, but as
      the peaceful submission of the minority to the majority which
      has become aware of its aims.  This petty-bourgeois utopia,
      which is inseparable from the idea of the state being above
      classes, led in practice to the betrayal of the interests of the
      working classes, as was shown, for example, by the history of
      the French revolutions of 1848 and 1871, and by the experience
      of &#8220;socialist&#8221; participation in bourgeois Cabinets in Britain,
      France, Italy and other countries at the turn of the century.
    </p>

    <p>
      All his life Marx fought against this petty-bourgeois socialism,
      now revived in Russia by the Socialist-Revolutionary and
      Menshevik parties.  He developed his theory of the class
      struggle consistently, down to the theory of political power, of
      the state.
    </p>

    <p>
      The overthrow of bourgeois rule can be accomplished only by the
      proletariat, the particular class whose economic conditions of
      existence prepare it for this task and provide it with the
      possibility and the power to perform it.  While the bourgeoisie
      break up and disintegrate the peasantry and all the
      petty-bourgeois groups, they weld together, unite and organize
      the proletariat.  Only the proletariat &#8212; by virtue of the
      economic role it plays in large-scale production &#8212; is
      capable of being the leader of all the working and exploited
      people, whom the bourgeoisie exploit, oppress and crush, often
      not less but more than they do the proletarians, but who are
      incapable of waging an independent struggle for their
      emancipation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The theory of class struggle, applied by Marx to the question of
      the state and the socialist revolution, leads as a matter of
      course to the recognition of the political rule of the
      proletariat, of its dictatorship, i.e., of undivided power
      directly backed by the armed force of the people.  The overthrow
      of the bourgeoisie can be achieved only by the proletariat
      becoming the ruling class, capable of crushing the inevitable
      and desperate resistance of the bourgeoisie, and of organizing
      all the working and exploited people for the new economic
      system.
    </p>

    <p>
      The proletariat needs state power, a centralized organization of
      force, an organization of violence, both to crush the resistance
      of the exploiters and to lead the enormous mass of the
      population &#8212; the peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and
      semi-proletarians &#8212; in the work of organizing a socialist
      economy.
    </p>

    <p>
      By educating the workers' party, Marxism educates the vanguard
      of the proletariat, capable of assuming power and leading the
      whole people to socialism, of directing and organizing the new
      system, of being the teacher, the guide, the leader of all the
      working and exploited people in organizing their social life
      without the bourgeoisie and against the bourgeoisie.  By
      contrast, the opportunism now prevailing trains the members of
      the workers' party to be the representatives of the better-paid
      workers, who lose touch with the masses, "get along" fairly well
      under capitalism, and sell their birthright for a mass of
      pottage, i.e., renounce their role as revolutionary leaders of
      the people against the bourgeoisie.
    </p>

    <p>
      Marx's theory of "the state, i.e., the proletariat organized as
      the ruling class", is inseparably bound up with the whole of his
      doctrine of the revolutionary role of the proletariat in
      history.  The culmination of this rule is the proletarian
      dictatorship, the political rule of the proletariat.
    </p>

    <p>
      But since the proletariat needs the state as a special form of
      organization of violence against the bourgeoisie, the following
      conclusion suggests itself: is it conceivable that such an
      organization can be created without first abolishing, destroying
      the state machine created by the bourgeoisie for themselves? The
      <em>Communist Manifesto</em> leads straight to this conclusion,
      and it is of this conclusion that Marx speaks when summing up
      the experience of the revolution of 1848-51.

      2. The Revolution Summed Up
    </h4>

    <p>Marx sums up his conclusions from the revolution of 1848-51, on the
      subject of the state we are concerned with, in the following argument
      contained in <em> The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</em>:
    </p>
    
    <p class="quote">
      "But the revolution is throughgoing.  It is still journeying
      through purgatory.  It does its work methodically.  By December
      2, 1851 [the day of Louis Bonaparte's coup d'etat], it had
      completed one half of its preparatory work.  It is now
      completing the other half.  First it perfected the parliamentary
      power, in order to be able to overthrow it.  Now that it has
      attained this, it is perfecting the executive power, reducing it
      to its purest expression, isolating it, setting it up against
      itself as the sole object, in order to concentrate all its
      forces of destruction against it.  And when it has done this
      second half of its preliminary work, Europe will leap from its
      seat and exultantly exclaim: well grubbed, old mole!
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "This executive power with its enormous bureaucratic and
      military organization, with its vast and ingenious state
      machinery, with a host of officials numbering half a million,
      besides an army of another half million, this appalling
      parasitic body, which enmeshes the body of French society and
      chokes all its pores, sprang up in the days of the absolute
      monarchy, with the decay of the feudal system, which it helped
      to hasten." The first French Revolution developed
      centralization, "but at the same time" it increased "the extent,
      the attributes and the number of agents of governmental power.
      Napoleon completed this state machinery".  The legitimate
      monarchy and the July monarchy "added nothing but a greater
      division of labor"....
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "... Finally, in its struggle against the revolution, the
      parliamentary republic found itself compelled to strengthen,
      along with repressive measures, the resources and centralization
      of governmental power.  All revolutions perfected this machine
      instead of smashing it.  The parties that contended in turn for
      domination regarded the possession of this huge state edifice as
      the principal spoils of the victor."

      (<a href="../../../../marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/index.htm">The
	Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</a><br />

      <a href="../../../../marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch07.htm#staterev">pp.98-99</a>,
      fourth edition, Hamburg, 

      1907)<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw03" name="bk03">[3]</a></sup>

    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this remarkable argument, Marxism takes a tremendous step
      forward compared with the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>.  In the
      latter, the question of the state is still treated in an
      extremely abstract manner, in the most general terms and
      expressions.  In the above-quoted passage, the question is
      treated in a concrete manner, and the conclusion is extremely
      precise, definite, practical and palpable: all previous
      revolutions perfected the state machine, whereas it must be
      broken, smashed.
    </p>

    <p>
      This conclusion is the chief and fundamental point in the
      Marxist theory of the state.  And it is precisely this
      fundamental point which has been completely ignored by the
      dominant official Social-Democratic parties and, indeed,
      distorted (as we shall see later) by the foremost theoretician
      of the Second International, Karl Kautsky.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <em>Communist Manifesto</em> gives a general summary of
      history, which compels us to regard the state as the organ of
      class rule and leads us to the inevitable conclusion that the
      proletariat cannot overthrow the bourgeoisie without first
      winning political power, without attaining political supremacy,
      without transforming the state into the "proletariat organized
      as the ruling class"; and that this proletarian state will begin
      to wither away immediately after its victory because the state
      is unnecessary and cannot exist in a society in which there are
      no class antagonisms.  The question as to how, from the point of
      view of historical development, the replacement of the bourgeois
      by the proletarian state is to take place is not raised here.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the question Marx raises and answers in 1852.  True to
      his philosophy of dialectical materialism, Marx takes as his
      basis the historical experience of the great years of
      revolution, 1848 to 1851.  Here, as everywhere else, his theory
      is a summing up of experience, illuminated by a profound
      philosophical conception of the world and a rich knowledge of
      history.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem of the state is put specifically: How did the
      bourgeois state, the state machine necessary for the rule of the
      bourgeoisie, come into being historically? What changes did it
      undergo, what evolution did it perform in the course of
      bourgeois revolutions and in the face of the independent actions
      of the oppressed classes? What are the tasks of the proletariat
      in relation to this state machine?
    </p>

    <p>
      The centralized state power that is peculiar to bourgeois
      society came into being in the period of the fall of absolutism.
      Two institutions most characteristic of this state machine are
      the bureaucracy and the standing army.  In their works, Marx and
      Engels repeatedly show that the bourgeoisie are connected with
      these institutions by thousands of threads.  Every worker's
      experience illustrates this connection in an extremely graphic
      and impressive manner.  From its own bitter experience, the
      working class learns to recognize this connection.  That is why
      it so easily grasps and so firmly learns the doctrine which
      shows the inevitability of this connection, a doctrine which the
      petty-bourgeois democrats either ignorantly and flippantly deny,
      or still more flippantly admit "in general", while forgetting to
      draw appropriate practical conclusions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bureaucracy and the standing army are a &#8220;parasite&#8221; on the
      body of bourgeois society--a parasite created by the internal
      antagonisms which rend that society, but a parasite which
      &#8220;chokes&#8221; all its vital pores.  The Kautskyite opportunism now
      prevailing in official Social-Democracy considers the view that
      the state is a parasitic organism to be the peculiar and
      exclusive attribute of anarchism.  It goes without saying that
      this distortion of Marxism is of vast advantage to those
      philistines who have reduced socialism to the unheard-of
      disgrace of justifying and prettifying the imperialist war by
      applying to it the concept of "defence of the fatherland"; but
      it is unquestionably a distortion, nevertheless.
    </p>

    <p>
      The development, perfection, and strengthening of the
      bureaucratic and military apparatus proceeded during all the
      numerous bourgeois revolutions which Europe has witnessed since
      the fall of feudalism.  In particular, it is the petty bourgeois
      who are attracted to the side of the big bourgeoisie and are
      largely subordinated to them through this apparatus, which
      provides the upper sections of the peasants, small artisans,
      tradesmen, and the like with comparatively comfortable, quiet,
      and respectable jobs raising the holders above the people.
      Consider what happened in Russia during the six months following
      February 27, 1917.  The official posts which formerly were given
      by preference to the Black Hundreds have now become the spoils
      of the Cadets, Mensheviks, and Social-Revolutionaries.  Nobody
      has really thought of introducing any serious reforms.  Every
      effort has been made to put them off "until the Constituent
      Assembly meets", and to steadily put off its convocation until
      after the war! But there has been no delay, no waiting for the
      Constituent Assembly, in the matter of dividing the spoils of
      getting the lucrative jobs of ministers, deputy ministers,
      governors-general, etc., etc.! The game of combinations that has
      been played in forming the government has been, in essence, only
      an expression of this division and redivision of the &#8220;spoils&#8221;,
      which has been going on above and below, throughout the country,
      in every department of central and local government.  The six
      months between February 27 and August 27, 1917, can be summed
      up, objectively summed up beyond all dispute, as follows:
      reforms shelved, distribution of official jobs accomplished and
      &#8220;mistakes&#8221; in the distribution corrected by a few
      redistributions.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the more the bureaucratic apparatus is &#8220;redistributed&#8221; among
      the various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties (among the
      Cadets, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in the case of
      Russia), the more keenly aware the oppressed classes, and the
      proletariat at their head, become of their irreconcilable
      hostility to the whole of bourgeois society.  Hence the need for
      all bourgeois parties, even for the most democratic and
      "revolutionary-democratic" among them, to intensify repressive
      measures against the revolutionary proletariat, to strengthen
      the apparatus of coercion, i.e., the state machine.  This course
      of events compels the revolution "to concentrate all its forces
      of destruction" against the state power, and to set itself the
      aim, not of improving the state machine, but of smashing and
      destroying it.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was not logical reasoning, but actual developments, the
      actual experience of 1848-51, that led to the matter being
      presented in this way.  The extent to which Marx held strictly
      to the solid ground of historical experience can be seen from
      the fact that, in 1852, he did not yet specifically raise the
      question of what was to take the place of the state machine to
      be destroyed.  Experience had not yet provided material for
      dealing with this question, which history placed on the agenda
      later on, in 1871.  In 1852, all that could be established with
      the accuracy of scientific observation was that the proletarian
      revolution had approached the task of "concentrating all its
      forces of destruction" against the state power, of &#8220;smashing&#8221;
      the state machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here the question may arise: is it correct to generalize the
      experience, observations and conclusions of Marx, to apply them
      to a field that is wider than the history of France during the
      three years 1848-51? Before proceeding to deal with this
      question, let us recall a remark made by Engels and then examine
      the facts.

      In his introduction to the third edition of <em>The Eighteenth Brumaire</em>,
      Engels wrote:
    </p>
    
    <p class="quote">
      "France is the country where, more than anywhere else, the
      historical class struggles were each time fought out to a
      finish, and where, consequently, the changing political forms
      within which they move and in which their results are summarized
      have been stamped in the sharpest outlines.  The centre of
      feudalism in the Middle Ages, the model country, since the
      Renaissance, of a unified monarchy based on social estates,
      France demolished feudalism in the Great Revolution and
      established the rule of the bourgeoisie in a classical purity
      unequalled by any other European land.  And the struggle of the
      upward-striving proletariat against the ruling bourgeoisie
      appeared here in an acute form unknown elsewhere."

      (p.4, 1907 edition)
    </p>

    <p>
      The last remark is out of date insomuch as since 1871 there has
      been a lull in the revolutionary struggle of the French
      proletariat, although, long as this lull may be, it does not at
      all preclude the possibility that in the coming proletarian
      revolution France may show herself to be the classic country of
      the class struggle to a finish.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let us, however, cast a general glance over the history of the
      advanced countries at the turn of the century.  We shall see
      that the same process went on more slowly, in more varied forms,
      in a much wider field: on the one hand, the development of
      "parliamentary power" both in the republican countries (France,
      America, Switzerland), and in the monarchies (Britain, Germany
      to a certain extent, Italy, the Scandinavia countries, etc.); on
      the other hand, a struggle for power among the various bourgeois
      and petty-bourgeois parties which distributed and redistributed
      the &#8220;spoils&#8221; of office, with the foundations of bourgeois
      society unchanged; and, lastly, the perfection and consolidation
      of the "executive power", of its bureaucratic and military
      apparatus.

      There is not the slightest doubt that these features are common
      to the whole of the modern evolution of all capitalist states in
      general.  In the last three years 1848-51 France displayed, in a
      swift, sharp, concentrated form, the very same processes of
      development which are peculiar to the whole capitalist world.

    <p>
      Imperialism--the era of bank capital, the era of gigantic
      capitalist monopolies, of the development of monopoly capitalism
      into state-monopoly capitalism--has clearly shown an
      unprecedented growth in its bureaucratic and military apparatus
      in connection with the intensification of repressive measures
      against the proletariat both in the monarchical and in the
      freest, republican countries.

      World history is now undoubtedly leading, on an incomparably larger
      scale than in 1852, to the "concentration of all the forces" of the
      proletarian revolution on the &#8220;destruction&#8221; of the state machine.

      What the proletariat will put in its place is suggested by the
      highly instructive material furnished by the Paris Commune.

      3. The Presentation of the Question by Marx in 1852
    </h4>
    
    <p>In 1907, Mehring, in the magazine <em>Neue 

	Zeit</em><sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw04" name="bk04">[4]</a></sup>

      (Vol.XXV,
      2, p.164), published extracts from Marx's letter to Weydemeyer
      dated March 5, 1852.  This letter, among other things, contains
      the following remarkable observation:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "And now as to myself, no credit is due to me for discovering
      the existence of classes in modern society or the struggle
      between them.  Long before me bourgeois historians had described
      the historical development of this class struggle and bourgeois
      economists, the economic anatomy of classes.  What I did that
      was new was to prove: (1) that the existence of classes is only
      bound up with the particular, historical phases in the
      development of production (historische Entwicklungsphasen der
      Produktion), (2) that the class struggle necessarily leads to
      the dictatorship of the proletariat, (3) that this dictatorship
      itself only constitutes the transition to the abolition of all
      classes and to a classless 

      society."<sup class="ednote"><a href="#fw05" name="bk05">[5]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      In these words, Marx succeeded in expressing with striking
      clarity, first, the chief and radical difference between his
      theory and that of the foremost and most profound thinkers of
      the bourgeoisie; and, secondly, the essence of his theory of the
      state.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is often said and written that the main point in Marx's
      theory is the class struggle.  But this is wrong.  And this
      wrong notion very often results in an opportunist distortion of
      Marxism and its falsification in a spirit acceptable to the
      bourgeoisie.  For the theory of the class struggle was created
      not by Marx, but by the bourgeoisie before Marx, and, generally
      speaking, it is acceptable to the bourgeoisie.  Those who
      recognize only the class struggle are not yet Marxists; they may
      be found to be still within the bounds of bourgeois thinking and
      bourgeois politics.  To confine Marxism to the theory of the
      class struggle means curtailing Marxism, distorting it, reducing
      it to something acceptable to the bourgeoisie.  Only he is a
      Marxist who extends the recognition of the class struggle to the
      recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat.  That is
      what constitutes the most profound distinction between the
      Marxist and the ordinary petty (as well as big) bourgeois.  This
      is the touchstone on which the real understanding and
      recognition of Marxism should be tested.  And it is not
      surprising that when the history of Europe brought the working
      class face to face with this question as a practical issue, not
      only all the opportunists and reformists, but all the
      Kautskyites (people who vacillate between reformism and Marxism)
      proved to be miserable philistines and petty-bourgeois democrats
      repudiating the dictatorship of the proletariat.  Kautsky's
      pamphlet, <em>The Dictatorship of the Proletariat</em>,
      published in August 1918, i.e., long after the first edition of
      the present book, is a perfect example of petty-bourgeois
      distortion of Marxism and base renunciation of it in deeds,
      while hypocritically recognizing it in words (see my pamphlet,
      <em>The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky</em>,
      Petrograd and Moscow, 1918).
    </p>

    <p>
      Opportunism today, as represented by its principal spokesman,
      the ex-Marxist Karl Kautsky, fits in completely with Marx's
      characterization of the bourgeois position quoted above, for
      this opportunism limits recognition of the class struggle to the
      sphere of bourgeois relations.  (Within this sphere, within its
      framework, not a single educated liberal will refuse to
      recognize the class struggle "in principle"!) Opportunism does
      not extend recognition of the class struggle to the cardinal
      point, to the period of transition from capitalism to communism,
      of the overthrow and the complete abolition of the bourgeoisie.
      In reality, this period inevitably is a period of an
      unprecedently violent class struggle in unprecedentedly acute
      forms, and, consequently, during this period the state must
      inevitably be a state that is democratic in a new way (for the
      proletariat and the propertyless in general) and dictatorial in
      a new way (against the bourgeoisie).
    </p>

    <p>
      Further.  The essence of Marx's theory of the state has been
      mastered only by those who realize that the dictatorship of a
      single class is necessary not only for every class society in
      general, not only for the proletariat which has overthrown the
      bourgeoisie, but also for the entire historical period which
      separates capitalism from "classless society", from communism.
      Bourgeois states are most varied in form, but their essence is
      the same: all these states, whatever their form, in the final
      analysis are inevitably the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
      The transition from capitalism to communism is certainly bound
      to yield a tremendous abundance and variety of political forms,
      but the essence will inevitably be the same: the dictatorship of
      the proletariat.

      Die Neue Zeit (New Times)--theoretical journal of the German
      Social-Democratic Party, published in Stuttgart from 1883 to 1923. It was
      edited by Karl Kautsky till October 1917 and by Heinrich Cunow in the
      subsequent period. It published some of Marx's and Engels's writings for the
      first time. Engels offered advice to its editors and often criticised them
      for departures from Marxism.

      In the second half of the nineties, upon Engels's death, the journal began
      systematically to publish revisionist articles,
      including a serial by Bernstein entitled "Problems of Socialism". which
      initiated a revisionist campaign against Marxism. During the First World War
      the journal adhered to a Centrist position, and virtually hacked the
      social-chauvinists.
