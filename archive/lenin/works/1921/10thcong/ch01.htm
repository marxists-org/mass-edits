      Speech At The Opening Of The Congress</h3> 

    <h4>March 8</h4>

    <p>
      (<em>Prolonged applause</em>.) Comrades, allow me to declare the
      Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party open. We have
      passed through a very eventful year both in international and in
      our own internal history. To begin with the international
      situation, let me say that this is the first time we have met in
      conditions in which the Communist International has ceased to be
      a mere slogan and has really been converted into a mighty
      organisation with foundations&#8212;real foundations&#8212;in
      the major advanced capitalist countries. What had only been a
      set of resolutions at the Second Congress of the Communist
      
      International<a id="bk02" href="#fw02" name="bk02"><sup 	
	  class="enote">[2]</sup></a> has been successfully
      implemented during the past year and has found expression,
      confirmation and consolidation in such countries as Germany,
      France and Italy. It is enough to name these three countries
      to show that the Communist International, since its Second
      Congress in Moscow last summer, has become part and parcel
      of the working-class movement in all the major advanced
      countries of Europe&#8212;more than that, it has become the
      chief factor in international politics. This is such a great
      achievement, comrades, that however difficult and severe the
      various trials ahead of us&#8212;and we cannot and must not
      lose sight of them&#8212;no one can deprive us of it!</p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, comrades, this is the first congress that is
      meeting without any hostile troops, supported by the capitalists
      and imperialists of the world, on the territory of the Soviet
      Republic. The Red Army&#8217;s victories over the past year have
      enabled us to open a Party Congress in such conditions for the
      first time. Three and a half years of unparalleled strugg]e, and
      the last of the hostile armies has been driven from our
      territory&#8212;that is our achievement! Of course, that has not
      won us everything, not by a long shot; nor have we won all that
      we have to&#8212;real freedom from imperialist invasion and
      intervention. On the contrary, their warfare against us has
      taken a form that is less military but is in some respects more
      severe and more dangerous. The transition from war to
      peace&#8212;which we hailed at the last Party Congress<a
      id="bk03" href="#fw03" name="bk03"><sup
      class="enote">[3]</sup></a> and in the light of which we have
      tried to organise our work&#8212;is still far from
      completed. Our Party is still confronted with incredibly
      difficult tasks, not only in respect of the economic
      plan&#8212;where we have made quite a few mistakes&#8212;or the
      basis of economic construction, but also the basis of relations
      between the classes remaining in our society, in this Soviet
      Republic. These relations have undergone a change, and
      this&#8212;you will all agree&#8212;should be one of the chief
      questions for you to examine and decide here.</p>

    <p>
      Comrades, we have passed through an exceptional year, we have
      allowed ourselves the luxury of discussions and disputes within
      the Party.<a id="bk04" href="#fw04" name="bk04"><sup
      class="enote">[4]</sup></a> This was an amazing luxury for a
      Party shouldering unprecedented responsibilities and surrounded
      by mighty and powerful enemies uniting the whole capitalist
      world.</p>

    <p>
      I do not know how you will assess that fact now. Was it fully
      compatible with our resources, both material and spiritual? It
      is up to you to appraise this. At all events, however, I must
      say that the slogan, task and aim which we should set ourselves
      at this Congress and which we must accomplish at all costs, is
      to emerge from the discussions and disputes stronger than
      before. (<em>Applause</em>.) You, comrades, cannot fail to be
      aware that all our enemies&#8212;and their name is
      legion&#8212;in all their innumerable press organs abroad
      repeat, elaborate and multiply the same wild rumour that our
      bourgeois and petty-bourgeois enemies spread here inside the
      Soviet Republic, namely: discussion means disputes; disputes
      mean discord; discord means that the Communists have become
      weak; press hard, seize the opportunity, take advantage of their
      weakening. This has become the slogan of the hostile world. We
      must not forget this for a moment. Our task now is to show that,
      to whatever 
extent we have allowed ourselves this luxury in the past, whether rightly or wrongly, we must emerge from this situation in such a way that, having properly examined the extraordinary abundance of platforms, shades, slight shades and almost slight shades of opinion, that have been formulated and discussed, we at our Party Congress could say to ourselves: at all events, whatever form the discussion has taken up to now, however much we have argued among ourselves&#8212;and we are confronted with so many enemies&#8212;the task of the dictatorship of the proletariat in a peasant country is so vast and difficult that formal cohesion is far from enough. (Your presence here at the Congress is a sign that we have that much.) Our efforts should be more united and harmonious than ever before; there should not be the slightest trace of factionalism&#8212;whatever its manifestations in the past. That we must not have on any account. That is the only condition on which we shall accomplish the immense tasks that confront us. I am sure that I express the intention and firm resolve of all of you when I say: at all events, the end of this Congress must find our Party stronger, more harmonious, and more sincerely united than ever before. (<em>Applause</em>.)</p>

                                Report On The Political Work 
                          Of<br /> The Central Committee Of The R.C.P.(B.)</h3> 
                                                       <h4>March 8</h4>

    <p>
      Comrades, the question of the Central Committee&#8217;s
      political work, as you are, of course, aware, is so closely
      bound up with the whole work of the Party and Soviet
      institutions, and with the whole course of the revolution, that
      in my view, at any rate, there can be no question of a report in
      the full sense of the word. Accordingly, I take it to be my task
      to try to single out some of the more important events which, I
      think, represent the cardinal points of our work and of Soviet
      policy over the past year, which are most typical of what we
      have gone through and which provide most food for thought
      concerning the reasons for the course taken by the revolution,
      the significance of our mistakes&#8212;and these have been
      many&#8212;and the ]essons for the future. For no matter how
      natural it is to report on the events of the past year, no
      matter how essential it is for the Central Committee, and no
      matter how interesting such a report in itself may be for the
      Party, the tasks of the current and forthcoming struggle are so
      urgent, difficult and grave, and press so hard upon us that all
      our attention is unwittingly concentrated on how to draw the
      appropriate conclusions from past experience and how best to
      solve present and future problems on which all our attention is
      focused.</p>

    <p>
      Of all the key problems of our work in the past year, which
      chiefly hold our attention and with which, in my opinion, our
      mistakes are mainly connected, the most important is the
      transition from war to peace. All, or possibly most of you, will
      recall that we have attempted this transition several times
      during the past three and a half years, without once having
      completed it; and apparently we shall not accomplish it this
      time either because international 
capitalism is too vitally interested in preventing it. I recall that in April 1918, i.e., three years ago, I had occasion to speak to the All-Russia Central Executive Committee about our tasks, which at the time were formulated as if the Civil War had in the main come to an end, when in actual fact it had only just begun. You will all recall that at the pre vious Party Congress we based all our plans on the transition to peaceful construction, having assumed that the enormous concessions then made to Poland<a id="bk05" href="#fw05" name="bk05"><sup class="enote">[5]</sup></a>  would assure us of peace. As early as April, however, the Polish bourgeoisie, which, with the imperialists of the capitalist countries, interpreted our peaceful stand as a sign of weakness, started an offensive for which they paid dearly: they got a peace that was much worse. But we were unable to switch to peaceful construction and had once again to concentrate on the war with Poland and subsequently on wiping out Wrangel. That is what determined the substance of our work in the year under review. Once again all our work turned on military problems.</p>

    <p>
      Then followed the trunsition from war to peace when the last
      enemy soldier was finally driven from the territory of the
      R.S.F.S.R.</p>

    <p>
      This transition involved upheavals which we had certainly never
      foreseen. That is undoubtedly one of the main causes of all our
      mistakes in policy during the period under review, from which we
      are now suffering. We now realise that some of the tasks we had
      grossly underrated were posed by the demobilisation of the army,
      which had to be created in a country that had suffered
      unparalleled strains and stresses, and that had gone through
      several years of imperialist war. Its demobilisation put a
      terrible strain on our transport facilities, and this was
      intensified by the famine due to the crop failure and the fuel
      shortage, which largely brought the railways to a
      standstill. That is largely the source of the series of
      crises&#8212;economic, social and political&#8212;that hit
      us. At the end of last year I had occasion to point out that one
      of the main difficulties of the coming spring would be that
      connected with the demobilisation of the army. I also pointed
      this out at the big discussion on December 30, which many of you
      may have attended. I must say that at the time we had scarcely
      any idea of the scale of these 
difficulties. We had not yet seen the extent of the possible technical difficulties; but then neither had we realised the extent to which the demobilisation would intensify all the misfortunes which befell the Soviet Republic, exhausted as it was by the old imperialist war and the new civil war. To some extent it would be right to say that the demobilisation brings out these difficulties to an even greater degree. For a number of years, the country had been dedicated to the solution of war tasks and had glven its all to solve them. It had ungrudgingly sacrificed all it had, its meagre reserves and resources, and only at tho end of the war were we able to see the full extent of that devastation and poverty which now condemn us to the simple healing of wounds for a long time to come. But even to this we cannot devote ourselves entirely. The technical difficulties of army demobilisation show a good part of the depth of that devastation which inevitably breeds, apart from other things, a whole series of economic and social crises. The war had habituated us&#8212;hundreds of thousands of men, the whole country&#8212;to war-time tasks, and when a great part of the army, having solved these military tasks, finds very much worse conditions and incredible hardships in the countryside, without any opportunity&#8212;because of this and the general crisis&#8212;to apply its labour, the result is something midway between war and peace. We find that it is a situation in which we cannot very well speak of peace. For it is the demobilisation&#8212;the end of the Civil War&#8212;that makes it impossible for us to concentrate on peaceful construction, because it brings about a continuation of the war, but in a new form. We find ourselves involved in a new kind of war, a new form of war, which is summed up in the word &#8220;banditism&#8221;&#8212;when tens and hundreds of thousands of demobilised soldiers, who are accustomed to the toils of war and regard it almost as their only trade, return, impoverished and ruined, and are unable to find work.</p>

    <p>
      Failure to reckon with the scale of the difficulties connected
      with the demobilisation was undoubtedly a mistake on the part of
      the Central Committee. It must, of course, be said that we had
      nothing to go on, for the Civil War was so arduous an effort
      that there was only one guiding principle: everything for
      victory on the Civil War front, 
and nothing else. It was only by observing this principle, and by the Red Army&#8217;s unparalleled efforts in the struggle against Kolchak, Yudenich and others, that we could hope to, achieve victory over the imperialists who had invaded Soviet Russia.</p>

    <p>
      From this crucial fact, which determined a whole series of
      mistakes and intensified the crisis, I should like to turn to
      the question of how a whole number of even more profound
      discrepancies, erroneous calculations or plans were brought to
      light in the work of the Party and the struggle of the entire
      proletariat. These were not only mistakes in planning, but in
      determining the balance of forces between our class and those
      classes in collaboration with which, and frequently in struggle
      against which, it had to decide the fate of the Republic. With
      this as a starting-point, let us turn to the results of the
      past, to our political experience, and to what the Central
      Committee, as the policy-making body, must understand and try to
      explain to the whole Party. These questions range from the
      course of our war with Poland to food and fuel. Our offensive,
      our too swift advance almost as far as Warsaw, was undoubtedly a
      mistake. I shall not now analyse whether it was a strategic or a
      political error, as this would take me too far afield. Let us
      leave it to future historians, for those of us who have to keep
      beating off the enemy in hard struggle have no time to indulge
      in historical research. At any rate, the mistake is there, and
      it was due to the fact that we had overestimated the superiority
      of our forces. It would be too difficult to decide now to what
      extent this superiority of forces depended on the economic
      conditions, and on the fact that the war with Poland aroused
      patriotic feelings even among the petty-bourgeois elements, who
      were by no means proletarians or sympathisers with communism, by
      no means giving unconditional support to the dictatorship of the
      proletariat; sometimes, in fact, they did not support it at
      all. But the fact remains that we had made a definite mistake in
      the war with Poland.</p>

    <p>
      We find a similar mistake in food. With regard to surplus food
      appropriation and its fulfilment there can be no doubt that the
      year under review was more favourable than the previous
      one. This year the amount of grain collected is 
over 250 million poods. By February 1, the figure was estimated at 235 million poods, as against the 210 million poods for the whole of the previous year; that is to say, more was collected in a much shorter period than for the whole of the previous year. It turned out, however, that of these 235 millions collected by February 1, we had used up 155 million poods within the first six months, that is, an average of 25 million or even more poods a month. Of course, we must on the whole admit that we were unable to space out our reserves properly, even when they were better than last year&#8217;s. We failed to see the full danger of the crisis approaching with the spring, and succumbed to the natural desire to increase the starving workers&#8217; ration. Of course, it must be said that there again we had no basis for our estimates. All capitalist countries, in spite of the anarchy and chaos intrinsic to capitalism, have as a basis for their economic planning, the experience of many decades which they can compare, for they have the same economic system differing only in details. From this comparison it is possible to deduce a genuinely scientific law, a certain regularity and uniformity. We cannot have and have not had anything of the kind, and it was quite natural that when at the end of the war the possibility finally arose to give the starving population a little more, we were unable all at once to establish the correct proportion. We should have obviously limited the increase in the ration, so as to create a certain reserve fund for a rainy day, which was due to come in the spring, and which has now arrived. That we failed to do. Once again it is a mistake typical of all our work, a mistake which shows that the transition from war to peace confronted us with a whole number of difficulties and problems, and we had neither the experience, the training, nor the requisite material to overcome them, and this worsened, intensified and aggravated the crisis to an extraordinary extent.</p>

    <p>
      We undoubtedly had something similar in fuel. It is crucial to
      economic construction. The output estimates and proper
      distribution of fuel had, of course, to be the basis for the
      entire transition from war to peace&#8212;to economic
      construction&#8212;which was discussed at the previous Party
      Congress and which has been the main concern and the focal 
point of all our policy during the year under review. There can be no question of overcoming our difficulties or rehabilitating our industry without it. In this respect, we are clearly in a better position now than we were last year. We used to be cut off from the coal and oil districts, but we got the coal and oil after the Red Army&#8217;s victories. In any case, our fuel resources have increased. We know that the fuel resources with which we entered upon the year under review were greater than before. Accordingly, we made the mistake of immediately permitting such a wide distribution of fuel that these resources were exhausted and we were faced with a fuel crisis beIore we had put everything in proper working order. You will hear special reports on all these problems, and I cannot even give you any approximate figures. But in any case, bearing in mind the experience of the past, we must say that this mistake was due to a wrong understanding of the state of affairs and the rapid pace of transition from war to peace. It turned out that the transition could only be made at a much slower pace than we had imagined. The lesson driven home to us over the past year is that the preparations had to be longer, and the pace slower. It is a lesson that the whole Party will need particularly to learn in order to determine our main tasks for the year ahead, if we are to avoid similar mistakes in the future.</p>

    <p>
      I must add that the crop failure aggravated these mistakes and
      especially the resultant crises. I have pointed out that the
      food effort during the year under review gave us very much
      better food reserves, but that too was one of the main sources
      of the crises, because the crop failure had led to an acute feed
      shortage, a great loss of cattle and widespread ruin among the
      peasants, so that these grain procurements fell mainly in places
      where the grain surplus was not very large. There are far
      greater surpluses in various outlying areas of the Republic, in
      Siberia and in the Northern Caucasus, but it is there that the
      Soviet power was less stable, the Soviet government apparatus
      least efficient, and transportation from over there was very
      difficult. That is why it turned out that we collected the
      increased food reserves from the gubernias with the poorer crops
      and this went to intensify the crisis in the peasant economy
      considerably. 

    </p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;
      Here again we clearly see that our estimates were not as
      accurate as they should have been. But then we were in such a
      tight corner that we had no choice. A country which, after a
      devastating imperialist war, survived such a thing as a long
      civil war, could not, of course, exist without giving the front
      everything it had. And, once ruined, what could it do but take
      the peasants&#8217; surpluses, even without compensating them by
      any other means. We had to do this to save the country, the
      army, and the workers&#8217; and peasants&#8217; government. We
      said to the peasants: &#8220;Of course, you are lending your
      grain to the workers&#8217; and peasants&#8217; state, but
      unless you do, you cannot expect to save the country from the
      landowners and the capitalists.&#8221; We could do nothing else
      in the circumstances forced upon us by the imperialists and the
      capitalists through their war. We had no choice. But these
      circumstances led to such a weakening of the peasant economy
      after the long war that the crop failure was due also to the
      smaller sown area, worsening equipment, lower crop yields,
      shortage of hands, etc. The crop failure was disastrous, but the
      collection of surplus grain, which was rather better than we had
      expected, was accompanied by an aggravation of the crisis that
      may bring us still greater difficulties and calamities in the
      months to come. We must carefully reckon with this fact when
      analysing our political experience of the past year, and the
      political tasks we set ourselves for the year ahead. The year
      under review has left the following year with the same urgent
      problems.</p>

    <p>
      I shall now deal with another point from a totally different
      sphere&#8212;the trade union discussion, which has taken up so
      much of the Party&#8217;s time. I mentioned it earlier on today,
      and could naturally only venture the cautious remark that I
      thought many of you would consider this discussion as being too
      great a luxury. I must add, for my part, that I think it was
      quite an impermissible luxury, and we certainly made a mistake
      when we allowed it, for we had failed to realise that we were
      pushing into the forefront a question which for objective
      reasons cannot be there. We allowed ourselves to indulge in this
      luxury, failing to realise how much attention we distracted from
      the vital and threatening question before us, namely, this
      question of the crisis.   
      What are the actual results of this discussion, which has been
      going on for so many months and which must have bored most of
      you? You will hear special reports on it, but I should like to
      draw your attention to one aspect of the matter. It is that in
      this case the saying, &#8220;Every cloud has a silver
      lining&#8221;, has been undoubtedly justified.</p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, there was rather a lot of cloud, and very little
      silver lining. (<em>Laughter</em>.) Still, the silver lining was
      there, for although we lost a great deal of time and diverted
      the attention of our Party comrades from the urgent tasks of the
      struggle against the petty-bourgeois elements surrounding us, we
      did learn to discern certain relationships which we had not seen
      before. The good thing was that the Party was bound to learn
      something from this struggle. Although we all knew that, being
      the ruling party, we had inevitably to merge the Party and
      government leadership&#8212; they are merged and will remain
      so&#8212;the Party nevertheless learned a certain lesson in this
      discussion which cannot be ignored. Some platforms mostly got
      the votes of the &#8220;top&#8221; section of the Party. Some
      platforms which were sometimes called &#8220;the platforms of
      the Workers&#8217; Opposition&#8221;, and sometimes by other
      names, clearly proved to be an expression of a syndicalist
      deviation. That is not just my personal opinion, but that of the
      vast majority of those present. (<em>Voices </em>:
      &#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;)</p>

    <p>
      In this discussion, the Party proved itself to have matured to
      such an extent that, aware of a certain wavering of the
      &#8220;top&#8221; section and hearing the leadership say:
      &#8220;We cannot agree&#8212;sort us out,&#8221; it mobilised
      rapidly for this task and the vast majority of the more
      important Party organisations quickly responded: &#8220;We do
      have an opinion, and we shall let you know it.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      During the discussion we got a number of platforms. There were
      so many of them that, although in view of my position I should
      have read them all, I confess I had not. (<em>Laughter</em>.) I
      do not know whether all those present had found the time to read
      them, but, in any case, I must say that this syndicalist, and to
      a certain degree even semi-anarchist, deviation, which has
      crystallised, gives food for thought. For several months we
      allowed ourselves to wallow in the luxury of studying shades of
      opinion. 
      Meanwhile, the demobilisation of the army was producing banditry
      and aggravating the economic crisis. The discussion should have
      helped us to understand that our Party, with at least half a
      million members and possibly even more, has become, first, a
      mass party, and, second, the government party, and that as a
      mass party it reflects something of what is taking place outside
      its ranks. It is extremely important to understand this.</p>

    <p>
      There would be nothing to fear from a slight syndicalist or
      semi-anarchist deviation; the Party would have swiftly and
      decisively become aware of it, and would have set about
      correcting it. But it is no time to argue about theoretical
      deviations when one of them is bound up with the tremendous
      preponderance of peasants in the country, when their
      dissatisfaction with the proletarian dictatorship is mounting,
      when the crisis in peasant farming is coming to a head, and when
      the demobilisation of the peasant army is setting loose hundreds
      and thousands of broken men who have nothing to do, whose only
      accustomed occupation is war and who breed banditry. At the
      Congress, we must make it quite clear that we cannot have
      arguments about deviations and that we must put a stop to
      that. The Party Congress can and must do this; it must draw the
      appropriate lesson, and add it to the Central Committee&#8217;s
      political report, consolidate and confirm it, and make it a
      Party law and duty. The atmosphere of the controversy is
      becoming extremely dangerous and constitutes a direct threat to
      the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>

    <p>
      A few months ago, when I had occasion to meet and argue with
      some comrades in a discussion and said, &#8220;Beware, this
      constitutes a threat to working-class rule and the dictatorship
      of the proletariat,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;This is
      intimidation, you are terrorising us.&#8221; On several
      occasions I have had to hear my remarks being labelled in this
      manner, and accusations of intimidation thrown about, and I
      replied that it would be absurd for me to try to intimidate old
      revolutionaries who had gone through all sorts of ordeals. But
      when you see the difficulties the demobilisation is producing
      you can no longer say it was an attempt at intimidation, or even
      an unavoidable exaggeration in the heat of the controversy; it
      was, in fact, an absolutely exact indication 
      of what we now have, and of our need for unity, discipline and
      restraint. We need all this not only because otherwise a
      proletarian party cannot work harmoniously, but because the
      spring has brought and will bring even more difficult conditions
      in which we cannot function without maximum unity. These two
      main lessons, I think, we shall still be able to learn from the
      discussion. I think it necessary to say, therefore, that whilst
      we did indulge in luxury and presented the world with a
      remarkable example of a party, engaged in a most desperate
      struggle, permitting itself the luxury of devoting unprecedented
      attention to the detailed elucidation of separate points of
      platforms&#8212;all this in face of a crop failure, a crisis,
      ruin and demobilisation&#8212;we shall now draw from these
      lessons a political conclusion&#8212;not just a conclusion
      pointing to some mistake, but a political
      conclusion&#8212;concerning the relations between classes,
      between the working class and the peasants. These relations are
      not what we had believed them to be. They demand much greater
      unity and concentration of forces on the part of the
      proletariat, and under the dictatorship of the proletariat they
      are a far greater danger than all the Denikins, Kolchaks and
      Yudeniches put together. It would be fatal to be deluded on this
      score! The difficulties stemming from the petty-bourgeois
      elemont are enormous, and if they are to be overcome, we must
      have great unity, and I don&#8217;t mean just a semblance of
      unity. We must all pull together with a single will, for in a
      peasant country only the will of the mass of proletarians will
      enable the proletariat to accomplish the great tasks of its
      leadership and dictatorship.</p>

    <p>
      Assistance is on its way from the West-European countries but it
      is not coming quickly enough. Still it is coming and
      growing.</p>

    <p>
      I pointed out this morning that one of the most important
      factors of the period under review, one closely related to the
      work of the Central Committee, is the organisation of the Second
      Congress of the Comintern. Of course, compared with last year,
      the world revolution has made considerable headway. Of course,
      the Communist International, which at the time of last
      year&#8217;s Congress existed only in the form of proclamations,
      has now begun to function as an independent 
      party in each country, and not merely as an advanced
      party&#8212;communism has become central to the working-class
      movement as a whole. In Germany, France and Italy the Communist
      International has become not only the centre of the
      working-class movement, but also the focus of political life in
      these countries. Any German or French newspaper you picked up
      last autumn contained abuse of Moscow and the Bolsheviks, who
      were called all sorts of names; in fact, the Bolsheviks and the
      21 conditions for admission to the Third International<a
      id="bk06" href="#fw06" name="bk06"><sup
      class="enote">[6]</sup></a> were made the central issue of their
      entire political life. That is an achievement no one can take
      away from us! It shows how the world revolution is growing and
      how it is paralleled by the aggravation of the economic crisis
      in Europe. But in any case, it would be madness on our part to
      assume that help will shortly arrive from Europe in the shape of
      a strong proletarian revolution, and I am sure no one here is
      making such an assumption. In these last three years, we have
      learned to understand that placing our stake on the world
      revolution does not mean relying on a definite date, and that
      the accelerating pace of development may or may not lead to a
      revolution in the spring. Therefore, we must be able to bring
      our work in line with the class balance here and elsewhere, so
      as to be able to maintain the dictatorship of the proletariat
      for a long time, and, however gradually, to remedy all our
      numerous misfortunes and crises. This is the only correct and
      sober approach.</p>

    <p>
      I shall now turn to an item concerning the work of the Central
      Committee during the present year which is closely related to
      the tasks facing us. It is the question of our foreign
      relations.</p>

    <p>
      Prior to the Ninth Party Congress, our attention and all our
      endeavours were aimed at switching from our relations of war
      with the capitalist countries to relations of peace and
      trade. For that purpose we undertook all sorts of diplomatic
      moves and bested men who were undoubtedly skilled
      diplomats. When, for instance, the representatives of America or
      of the League of 

      Nations<a id="bk07" href="#fw07"
	name="bk07"><sup 	
	  class="enote">[7]</sup></a> proposed that we halt
	hostilities against Denikin and Kolchak on certain stated
	terms, they thought we would land in difficulties. In actual
	fact, it was they who landed in difficulties and we who scored
	a great diplomatic victory. They were made to look silly, 
      they had to withdraw their terms, and this was subsequently
	exposed in all the diplomatic writings and press of the
	world. But we cannot rest content with a diplomatic
	victory. We need more than that: we need genuine trade
	relations. However, only this year has there been some
	development in trade relations. There is the question of trade
	relations with Britain, which has been central since the
	summer of last year. In this connection, the war with Poland
	was a considerable setback for us. Britain was ready to sign a
	trade agreement. The British bourgeoisie wanted it, but court
	circles in Britain were against it and hampered it, and the
	war with Poland delayed it. It so happens that the matter has
	not been settled yet.</p>
    
    <p>
      Today &#8217;s papers, I think, say that Krasin has told the
      press in London that he expects the trade agreement to be signed
      shortly.<a id="bk08" href="#fw08" name="bk08"><sup
      class="enote">[8]</sup></a>] I do not know whether these hopes
      are fully justified. I cannot be certain that it will actually
      take place, but for my part I must say that we in the Central
      Committee have devoted a great deal of attention to this
      question and considered it correct for us to compromise in order
      to achieve a trade agreement with Britain. Not only because we
      could obtain more from Britain than from other
      countries&#8212;she is, in this respect, not as advanced as,
      say, Germany or America. She is a colonial power, with too great
      a stake in Asian politics, and is sometimes too sensitive to the
      successes of the Soviet power in certain countries lying near
      her colonies. That is why our relations with Britain are
      especially tenuous. This tenuousness arises from such an
      objective tangle of causes that no amount of skill on the part
      of the Soviet diplomatists will help. But we need a trade treaty
      with Britain owing to the possibility opening up for a treaty
      with America, whose industrial capacity is so much greater.</p>

    <p>
      The concession issue is bound up with this. We devoted far more
      attention to it last year than before. A decree of the Council
      of People&#8217;s Commissars issued on November 23 set out the
      concession question in a form most acceptable to foreign
      capitalists. When certain misinterpretations or insufficient
      understanding of this problem arose in Party circles, a number
      of meetings of senior Party workers were held to discuss it. On
      the whole, there was not a great deal 
      of disagreement, although we did hear of many protests from
      workers and peasants. They said: &#8220;We got rid of our own
      capitalists, and now they want to call in some foreign
      capitalists.&#8221; Of course, the Central Committee had no
      statistics at its disposal to decide to what extent these
      protests were due to ignorance, or expressed the hopes of the
      kulak or outright capitalist section of the non-Party people who
      believe they have a legitimate right to be capitalists in
      Russia, and not like the foreign capitalists who are invited in
      without any power, but with real power. Indeed, it is most
      unlikely that statistics on such factors are available anywhere
      in the world. But this decree was, at any rate, a step towards
      establishing relations with a view to granting concessions. I
      must add that in practice&#8212;and this is something we must
      never forget&#8212;we have not secured a single concession. The
      point at issue is whether we should try to get them at all
      costs. Whether we get them or not does not depend on our
      arguments or decisions, but on international capital. On
      February 1 of this year, the Council of People&#8217;s
      Commissars took another decision on the concessions. Its first
      clause says: &#8220;To approve in principle the granting of oil
      concessions in Grozny and Baku and at other working oilfields
      and to open negotiations which should be pressed
      forward.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      There was some difference of opinion on this point. Some
      comrades thought it was wrong to grant concessions in Grozny and
      Baku, as this would arouse opposition among the workers. The
      majority on the Central Committee, including myself, took the
      view that there were possibly no grounds for the complaints.</p>

    <p>
      The majority on the Central Committee and I myself took the view
      that it was essential to grant these concessions, and we shall
      ask you to back it up with your authority. It is vital to have
      such an alliance with the state trusts of the advanced countries
      because our economic crisis is so deep that we cannot, on our
      own, rehahilitate our ruined economy without machinery and
      technical aid from abroad. Getting the equipment out here is not
      enough. We could grant concessions to the biggest imperialist
      trusts on a wider basis: say, a quarter of Baku, a quarter of
      Grozny, and a quarter of our best forest reserves, so as to
      assure ourselves of an 
      essential basis by the installation of the most modern
      machinery; on the other hand, in return for this we shall be
      getting badly needed machinery for the remaining part. In this
      way we shall be able to close a part&#8212;say, a quarter or a
      half&#8212;of the gap between us and the modern, advanced trusts
      of other countries. No one, with anything like a sober view of
      the present situation, will doubt that unless we do this we
      shall be in a very difficult position indeed, and shall be
      unable to overtake them without a superhuman
      effort. Negotiations with some of the largest world trusts have
      already begun. Naturally, for their part they are not simply
      doing us a good turn: they are in it only for the fantastic
      profits. Modern capitalism&#8212;as a non-belligerent diplomat
      would put it&#8212;is a robber, a ring. It is not the old
      capitalism of pre-war days: because of its monopoly of the world
      market its profit margins run to hundreds of per cents. Of
      course, this will exact a high price, but there is no other way
      out because the world revolution is marking time. There is no
      other way for us to raise our technology to the modern
      level. And if one of the crises were to give a sharp spur to the
      world revolution, and if it were to arrive before the concession
      terms ran out, our concession obligations would turn out to be
      less onerous than they appear on paper.</p>

    <p>
      On February 1, 1921, the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars
      decided to purchase 18,500,000 poods of coal abroad, for our
      fuel crisis was already in evidence. It had already become clear
      by then that we would have to expend our gold reserves not only
      on the purchase of machinery. In the latter case, our coal
      output would have increased, for we would have boosted our
      production if, instead of coal, we had bought machines abroad to
      develop our coal industry, but the crisis was so acute that we
      had to opt for the worse economic step and spend our money on
      the coal we could have produced at home. We shall have to make
      further compromises to buy consumer goods for the peasants and
      workers.</p>

    <p>
      I should now like to deal with the Kronstadt events.<a id="bk09"
      href="#fw09" name="bk09"><sup class="enote">[9]</sup></a> I have
      not yet received the latest news from Kronstadt, but I have no
      doubt that this mutiny, which very quickly revealed to us the
      familiar figures of whiteguard generals, will be put down within
      the next few days, if not hours.  There can be no doubt about
      this. But it is essential that we make a thorough appraisal of
      the political and economic lessons of this event.</p>

    <p>
      What does it mean? It was an attempt to seize political power
      from the Bolsheviks by a motley crowd or alliance of
      ill-assorted elements, apparently just to the right of the
      Bolsheviks, or perhaps even to their
      &#8220;left&#8221;&#8212;you can&#8217;t really tell, so
      amorphous is the combination of political groupings that has
      tried to take power in Kronstadt. You all know, undoubtedly,
      that at the same time whiteguard generals were very active over
      there. There is ample proof of this. A fortnight before the
      Kronstadt events., the Paris newspapers reported a mutiny at
      Kronstadt. It is quite clear that it is the work of
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and whiteguard &eacute;migr&eacute;s,
      and at the same time the movement was reduced to a
      petty-bourgeois counter-revolution and petty-bourgeois
      anarchism. That is something quite new. This circumstance, in
      the context of all the crises, must be given careful political
      consideration and must be very thoroughly analysed. There is
      evidence here of the activity of petty-bourgeois anarchist
      elements with their slogans of unrestricted trade and invariable
      hostility to the dictatorship of the proletariat. This mood has
      had a wide influence on the proletariat. It has had an effect on
      factories in Moscow and a number of provincial centres. This
      petty-bourgeois counter-revolution is undoubtedly more dangerous
      than Denikin, Yudenich and Kolchak put together, because ours is
      a country where the proletariat is in a minority, where peasant
      property has gone to ruin and where, in addition, the
      demobilisation has set loose vast numbers of potentially
      mutinous elements. No matter how big or small the initial, shall
      I say, shift in power, which the Kronstadt sailors and workers
      put forward&#8212;they wanted to correct the Bolsheviks in
      regard to restrictions in trade&#8212;and this looks like a
      small shift, which leaves the same slogans of &#8220;Soviet
      power&#8221; with ever so slight a change or correction. Yet, in
      actual fact the whiteguards only used the non-Party elements as
      a stepping stone to get in. This is politically inevitable. We
      saw the petty-bourgeois, anarchist elements in the Russian
      revolution, and we have been fighting them for decades. We have
      seen them in action since February 1917, during the great
      revolution, and their parties&#8217; attempts to prove that
      their programme differed little from that of the Bolsheviks, but
      that only their methods in carrying it through were
      different. We know this not only from the experience of the
      October Revolution, but also of the outlying regions and various
      areas within the former Russian Empire where the Soviet power
      was temporarily replaced by other regimes. Let us recall the
      Democratic Committee in Samara.<a id="bk10" href="#fw10"
      name="bk10"><sup class="enote">[10]</sup></a> They all came in
      demanding equality, freedom, and a constituent assembly, and
      every time they proved to be nothing but a conduit for
      whiteguard rule. Because the Soviet power is being shaken by the
      economic situation, we must consider all this experience and
      draw the theoretical conclusions a Marxist cannot escape. The
      experience of the whole of Europe shows the practical results of
      trying to sit between two stools. That is why in this context we
      must say that political friction, in this case, is a great
      danger. We must take a hard look at this petty-bourgeois
      counter-revolution with its calls for freedom to
      trade. Unrestricted trade&#8212;even if it is not as bound up
      initially with the whiteguards as Kronstadt was&#8212;is still
      only the thin end of the wedge for the whiteguard element, a
      victory for capital and its complete restoration. We must, I
      repeat, have a keen sense of this political danger.</p>

    <p>
      It shows what I said in dealing with our platforms discussion:
      in face of this danger we must understand that we must do more
      than put an end to Party disputes as a matter of form&#8212;we
      shall do that, of course. We need to remember that we must take
      a much more serious approach to this question.</p>

    <p>
      We have to understand that, with the peasant economy in the grip
      of a crisis, we can survive only by appealing to the peasants to
      help town and countryside. We must bear in mind that the
      bourgeoisie is trying to pit the peasants against the workers;
      that behind a fa&ccedil;ade of workers&#8217; slogans it is
      trying to incite the petty-bourgeois anarchist elements against
      the workers. This, if successful, will lead directly to the
      overthrow of the dictatorship of the proletariat and,
      consequently, to the restoration of capitalism and of the old
      landowner and capitalist regime. The political danger here is
      obvious. A number of revolutions have clearly gone that way; we
      have always been mindful of this possibility and have warned
      against it. This undoubtedly demands of the ruling party of
      Communists, and of the leading revolutionary elements of the
      proletariat a different attitude to the one we have time and
      again displayed over the past year. It is a danger that
      undoubtedly calls for much greater unity and discipline; it
      undoubtedly requires that we should all pull harder
      together. Otherwise we shall not cope with the dangers that have
      fallen to our lot.</p>

    <p>
      Then there are the economic problems. What is the meaning of the
      unrestricted trade demanded by the petty-bourgeois elements? It
      is that in the proletariat&#8217;s relations with the small
      farmers there are difficult problems and tasks we have yet to
      solve. I am-speaking of the victorious proletar iat&#8217;s
      relations with the small proprietors when the proletarian
      revolution unfolds in a country where the proletariat is in a
      minority, and the petty bourgeoisie, in a majority. In such a
      country the proletariat&#8217;s role is to direct the transition
      of these small proprietors to socialised and collective
      work. Theoretically this is beyond dispute. We have dealt with
      this transition in a number of legislative acts, but we know
      that it does not turn on legislative acts, but on practical
      implementation, which, we also know, can be guaranteed when you
      have a very powerful, large-scale industry capable of providing
      the petty producer with such benefits that he will see its
      advantages in practice.</p>

    <p>
      That is how Marxists and all socialists who have given thought
      to the social revolution and. its tasks have always regarded the
      question in theory. But Russia&#8217;s most pronounced
      characteristic of which I have spoken is that we have, on the
      one hand, not only a minority, but a considerable minority of
      proletarians, and, on the other, a vast majority of
      peasants. And the conditions in which we have had to defend the
      revolution made the solution of our problems incredibly
      difficult. We have not been able to show all the advantages of
      large-scale production, for it lies in ruins, and is dragging
      out a miserable existence. It can only be rehabilitated by
      demanding sacrifices from these very same small farmers. To get
      industry on its feet you need fuel; if you need fuel, you must
      rely on firewood; and if you rely on firewood, you must look to
      the peasant and 
      his horse. In conditions of crisis, the fodder shortage and the
      loss of cattle, the peasant must give his produce on credit to
      the Soviet power for the sake of a large-scale industry which
      has not yet given him a thing. That is the economic situation
      which gives rise to enormous difficulties and demands a deeper
      analysis of the conditions of transition from war to peace. We
      cannot run a war-time economy otherwise than by telling the
      peasants: &#8220;You must make loans to the workers&#8217; and
      peasants&#8217; state to help it pull through.&#8221; When
      concentrating on economic rehabilitation, we must understand
      that we have before us a small farmer, a small proprietor and
      producer who will work for the market until the rehabilitation
      and triumph of large-scale production. But rehabilitation on the
      old basis is impossible; it will take years, at least a decade,
      and possibly longer, in view of the havoc. Until then we shall
      have to deal, for many long years, with the small producer as
      such, and the unrestricted trade slogan will be inevitable. It
      is dangerous, not because it covers up the aspirations of the
      whiteguards and Mensheviks, but because it may become widespread
      in spite of the peasants&#8217; hatred for the whiteguards. It
      is apt to spread because it conforms to the economic conditions
      of the small producer&#8217;s existence. It is out of such
      considerations that the Central Committee adopted its decision
      to start a discussion on the substitution of a tax for surplus
      food appropriation and today placed this question squarely
      before the Congress, a motion which today&#8217;s resolution
      approves.<a id="bk11" href="#fw11" name="bk11"><sup
      class="enote">[11]</sup></a> The tax and appropriation problem
      had been brought up in our legislation a long time ago, back in
      late 1918. The tax law was dated October 30, 1918. The law on a
      tax in kind on the farmer was enacted, but never became
      operative. A number of instructions were issued in the few
      months after its promulgation, but it was never applied. On the
      other hand, the confiscation of surpluses from the peasants was
      a measure with which we were saddled by the imperative
      conditions of war-time, but which no longer applies to anything
      like the peace time conditions of the peasant&#8217;s
      economy. He needs the assurance that, while he has to give away
      a certain amount, he will have so much left to sell locally.</p>

    <p>
      The whole of our economy and its various branches were
      affected throughout by war-time conditions. With this in mind,
      our task was to collect a definite quantity of food, regardless
      of what it did to the national turnover. As we turn from
      problems of war to those of peace, we take a different view of
      the tax in kind: we see it not only from the standpoint of
      meeting the needs of the state, but also those of the small
      farms. We must try to understand the economic forms of the petty
      farmer&#8217;s indignation against the proletariat which has
      been in evidence and which is being aggravated in the current
      crisis. We must try to do our utmost in this respect for it is a
      matter of vital importance. We must allow the peasant to have a
      certain amount of leeway in local trade, and supplant the
      surplus food appropriation by a tax, to give the small farmer a
      chance to plan his production and determine its scale in
      accordance with the tax. We know quite well, of course, that in
      our conditions this is a very difficult thing to do. The sown
      area, the crop yield, and the farm implements have all been
      reduced, the surpluses have undoubtedly decreased, and in very
      many cases have disappeared altogether. These circumstances must
      be regarded as a fact. The peasant will have to go hungry for a
      while in order to save the towns and factories from famine. That
      is something quite understandable on a country-wide scale, but
      we do not expect the poverty-stricken lone-wolf farmer to
      understand it. And we know that we shall not be able to do
      without coercion, on which the impoverished peasants are very
      touchy. Nor must we imagine that this measure will rid us of the
      crisis. But we do regard it as our task to make the maximum
      concessions, to give the small producer the best conditions to
      come into his own. Up to now, we have been adapting ourselves to
      the tasks of war; we must now adapt ourselves to the conditions
      of peace. The Central Committee is faced with this
      task&#8212;the task of switching to the tax in kind in
      conditions of proletarian power, and it is closely bound up with
      the question of concessions.<a id="fw12" href="#fw12" name="bk12">[12]</a> You will be having a special
      discussion on this problem, and it requires your special
      consideration. By granting concessions, the proletarian power
      can secure an agreement with advanced capitalist states. On it
      depends our industrial growth, without which we cannot hope to
      advance towards communism.

      On the other hand, in this period of transition in a country
      where the peasants predominate, we must manage to go over to
      measures giving economic security to the peasants, and do the
      most we can to ease their economic condition. Until we have
      remoulded the peasant, until large-scale machinery has recast
      him, we must assure him of the possibility of running his
      economy without restrictions. We are now in a transitional
      phase, and our revolution is surrounded by capitalist
      countries. As long as we are in this phase, we are forced to
      seek highly complex forms of relationships. Oppressed by war, we
      were unable to concentrate on how to establish economic
      relations between the proletarian state power, with an
      incredibly devastated large-scale industry, and the small
      farmers, and how to find forms of coexistence with them, who, as
      long as they remain small farmers, cannot exist without their
      small economy having some system of exchange. I believe this to
      be the Soviet Government&#8217;s most important question in the
      sphere of economics and politics at the present time. I believe
      that it sums up the political results of our work, now that the
      war period has ended and we have begun, in the year under
      review, to make the transition to peace.</p>

    <p>
      This transition is bound up with such difficulties and has so
      clearly delineated this petty-bourgeois element, that we must
      take a sober view of it. We view this series of events in terms
      of the class struggle, and we have never doubted that the
      relations between the proletariat and the petty bourgeoisie are
      a difficult problem, demanding complex measures or, to be more
      accurate, a whole system of complex, transitional measures, to
      ensure the victory of the proletarian power. The fact that we
      issued our tax in kind decree at the end of 1918 proves that the
      Communists were aware of this problem, but were unable to solve
      it because of the war. With the Civil War on, we had to adopt
      war-time measures. But it would be a very great mistake indeed
      if we drew the conclusion that these are the only measures and
      relations possible. That would surely lead to the collapse of
      the Soviet power and the dictatorship of the proletariat. When
      the transition to peace takes place in a period of economic
      crisis, it should be borne in mind that it is easier to build up
      a proletarian state in a country with large-scale production
      than in one with a predominantly small-scale production. This
      problem has to be approached in a whole number of ways, and we
      do not close our eyes to these difficulties, or forget that the
      proletariat is one thing, and the small-scale producer,
      another. We have not forgotten that there are different classes,
      that petty-bourgeois, anarchist counter-revolution is a
      political step to whiteguard rule. We must face this squarely,
      with an awareness that this needs, on the one hand, maximum
      unity, restraint and discipline within the proletarian party,
      and on the other, a series of economic measures which we have
      not been able to carry out so far because of the war. We must
      recognise the need to grant concessions, and purchase machinery
      and equipment to satisfy agriculture, so as to exchange them for
      grain and re-establish relations between the proletariat and the
      peasants which will enable it to exist in peace-time
      conditions. I trust that we shall return to this problem, and I
      repeat that, in my view, we are dealing here with an important
      matter, and that the past year, which must be characterised as a
      period of transition from war to peace, confronts us with some
      extremely difficult problems.</p>

    <p>
      Let me say a few words in conclusion about combating
      bureaucratic practices, the question which has taken up so much
      of our time. It came up before the Central Committee last
      summer; in August the Central Committee sent a circular to all
      organisations, and the matter was put before a Party conference
      in September. Finally, at the December Congress of Soviets, it
      was dealt with on a wider scale.[58] We do have a bureaucratic
      ulcer; it has been diagnosed and has to be treated in
      earnest. Of course, in the discussion that we have had some
      platforms dealt with the problem quite frivolously, to say the
      least, and, by and large, from a petty-bourgeois
      viewpoint. There is no doubt that some discontent and stirrings
      have recently been in evidence among non-Party
      workers. Non-Party meetings in Moscow have clearly turned
      &#8220;democracy&#8221; and &#8220;freedom&#8221; into slogans
      leading up to the overthrow of the Soviet power. Many, or, at
      any rate, some representatives of the Workers&#8217; Opposition
      have battled against this petty-bourgeois, counter-revolutionary
      evil, and have said: &#8220;We shall unite against this.&#8221;
      And in actual fact they have been able to display the maximum
      unity. I cannot tell whether all the supporters of the
      Workers&#8217; Opposition group and other groups with
      semi-syndicalist platforms are like them. We need to learn more
      about this at the Congress, we need to understand that the
      struggle against the evils of bureaucracy is absolutely
      indispensable, and that it is just as intricate as the fight
      against the petty-bourgeois element. The bureaucratic practices
      of our state system have become such a serious malaise that they
      are dealt with in our Party Programme, because they are
      connected with this petty-bourgeois element, which is widely
      dispersed. This malaise can only be cured by the working
      people&#8217;s unity and their ability not only to welcome the
      decrees of the Workers&#8217; and Peasants&#8217; Inspection
      (have you seen many decrees that have not been welcomed?) but to
      exercise their right through the Inspection, something you
      don&#8217;t find either in the villages, the towns, or even the
      capital cities. Those who shout loudest against the evils of
      bureaucracy very frequently do not know how to exercise this
      right. Very great attention needs to be paid to this fact.</p>

    <p>
      In this area, we often see those who battle against this evil,
      possibly with a sincere desire to help the proletarian party,
      the proletarian dictatorship and the proletarian movement,
      actually helping the petty-bourgeois, anarchist element, which
      on more than one occasion during the revolution has shown itself
      to be the most dangerous enemy of the proletarian
      dictatorship. And now&#8212;and this is the main conclusion and
      lesson of the past year&#8212;it has once again shown itself to
      be the most dangerous enemy, which is most likely to have
      followers and supporters in a country like ours, to change the
      mood of the broad masses and to affect even a section of the
      non-Party workers. That is when the proletarian state finds
      itself in a very difficult position. Unless we understand this,
      learn our lesson, and make this Congress a turning-point both in
      cconomic policy and in the sense of maximum unity of the
      proletariat, we shall have to apply to ourselves the unfortunate
      saying: we have forgotten nothing of what&#8212;small and
      trifling at times&#8212;deserves to be forgotten, and have
      learned nothing of the serious things this year of the
      revolution should have taught us. I hope that will not be the
      case! (<em>Stormy applause</em>.)</p>

      <a id="fw02" href="#bk02" name="fw02">[2]</a>   The Second
      Congress, which laid the programme, tactical and organisational
      foundations of the Comintern, was held from July 19 to August 7,
      1920. It opened in Petrograd, but was transferred to Moscow on
      July 23. More than 200 delegates represented Communist Parties
      and workers&#8217; organisations from 37 countries. Committed to
      World Socialist Revolution, with many of the manifestos written
      by Lenin and  Trotsky, the 10th Congress of the
      R.C.P. dovetailed with the expections that the Russian
      Revolution, it's coming victory in the  Civil War would lead to
      revolution in Europe, the international prerequesite for the
      construction of the sociaism.</p>

    <p class="endnote">
      At the first sitting, Lenin gave a report on the international
      situation and the main tasks of the Comintern. Later he made
      speeches on the Communist Party, the nationalities and colonial
      questions, parliamentarism and other questions. He took part in
      the work of most of the commissions. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      The Congress adopted Lenin&#8217;s 21 conditions of affiliation
      to the Communist International, which was of great importance
      for creating and strengthening the new type of workers&#8217;
      parties in the capitalist countries. The ideas in Lenin&#8217;s
      classic <a href="../../1920/lwc/index.htm"><em>Left-Wing
      Communism, an Infantile Disorder</em></a> served as the basis of
      the Congress&#8217;s resolutions. Lenin also took part in
      drafting a resolution &#8220;On the Role of the Communist Party
      in the Proletarian Revolution&#8221;, which stressed that the
      Communist Party was the principal instrument in the liberation
      of the working class. Lenin&#8217;s theses on the nationalities
      and colonial question and on the agrarian question were also
      adopted as resolutions. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      The Congress stimulated the international communist
      movement. Lenin said that after the Congress &#8220;communism
      has become central to the working-class movement as a
      whole&#8221;. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      <a id="fw03" href="#bk03" name="fw03">[3]</a> <em>The Ninth
      Congress</em> was held in Moscow from March 29 to April 5,
      1920. It was attended by 715 delegates, the greatest number
      ever, who represented 611,978 Party members. Of them 553 had
      voice and vote, and 162, voice only. The delegates came from
      Central Russia, the Ukraine, the Urals, Siberia and other areas
      just liberated by the Red Army. Some delegates came straight
      from the front lines. The country was having a short respite
      after the defeat of Kolchak and Denikin. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      Items on the agenda were: 1) Report of the Central Committee; 2)
      Current tasks of economic construction; 3) Trade union movement;
      4) Organisational questions; 5) Tasks of the Communist
      International; 6) Attitude to co-operatives, 7) Transition to
      the militia system; 8) Election of the Central Committee; 9)
      Current business. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      Lenin guided the work of the Congress. He made a report on the
      Central Committee&#8217;s political activity and a summing-up
      speech; he spoke on economic construction and the co-operatives;
      he 
      proposed a list of candidates for election to the Central
      Committee. He also delivered the closing speech of the
      Congress. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      In the resolution, &#8220;The Current Tasks of Economic
      Construction&#8221;, the Congress stated that &#8220;the main
      condition of the country&#8217;s economic rehabilitation is the
      undeviating implementation of an integrated economic plan
      projected for the immediate historical period ahead&#8221;. See
      <em>K.P.S.S. v rezolutsiakh</em> . . . (<em>The C.P.S.U. in the
      Resolutions and Decisions of Congresses, Conferences and
      C.C. Plenary Meetings</em>, Part 1, 1954, p. 478). Lenin
      considered its key item&#8212;electrification&#8212;to be a
      great programme for a period of 10 or 20 years. The
      Congress&#8217;s directives served as the basis for GOELRO (the
      Plan of the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia),
      which was completed and adopted by the Eighth All-Russia
      Congress of Soviets in December 1920. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      The Congress also dealt with industrial management. The
      resolution on this question stressed the need to develop
      competent, firm and vigorous administration on the basis of
      one-man management. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      The anti-Party group of Democratic Centralism (T. V. Sapronov,
      N. Osinsky, V. V. Obolensky], V. M. Smirnov) came out against
      the Party&#8217;s line in economic construction, but its
      proposals were condemned and rejected by the Congress. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      The Congress discussed and approved the idea of labour emulation
      and communist <em>subbotniks</em>. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      The Congress discussed the trade unions&#8217; activity in
      helping to fulfil the economic tasks. It defined their role,
      their relationship with the Party and the state, the forms and
      methods of the Party&#8217;s leadership in the trade unions and
      their participation in economic construction. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      At a closed session on April 4, the Congress elected 19 members
      and 12 alternate members of the new Central Committee. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      <a id="fw04" href="#bk04" name="fw04">[4]</a> The reference is
      to the Party discussion of the trade unions&#8217; role and
      tasks in socialist construction. Lenin analysed these problems
      in his articles: <a href="../../1920/dec/30.htm"><em>The
      Trade Unions, The Present Situation and Trotsky&#8217;s
      Mistakes</em></a>; <a href="../../1921/jan/19.htm"><em>The Party
      Crisis</em></a>; <a href="../../1921/jan/25.htm"><em> Once Again on
      the Trade Unions, The Current Situation and the Mistakes of
      Trotsky and Bukharin</em></a>, and also in his speeches at the
      <a href="../../1921/jan/23.htm">Second All-Russia Congress of
      Miners</a> and at the Tenth Party Congress. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      <a id="fw05" href="#bk05" name="fw05">[5]</a> The Soviet
      Government did its utmost to establish normal and good-neighbour
      relations with Poland. In 1919, it offered peace on many
      occasions, but received no answer from her bourgeois-landowner
      government, which continued in its hostile policy towards Soviet
      Russia. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      On January 28, 1920, the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars of
      the R.S.F.S.R. sent the Polish Government and people a message
      re-emphasising its recognition of Poland&#8217;s independence
      and 
      sovereignty, and offering to make sizable territorial
      concessions to Poland. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      On February 2, 1920, the All-Russia Central Executive Committee
      once again offered peace to the Polish people. Their reactionary
      government was dependent on the imperialists of the Entente and
      considered the Soviet concessions a sign of weakness. It was
      preparing for aggression against the Soviet Republic and the
      negotiations failed. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      <a id="fw06" href="#bk06" name="fw06">[6]</a> <a
      href="../../1920/jul/x01.htm"><em>The 21 conditions for
      admission to the Comintern</em></a> were adopted by its Second
      Congress on August 6, 1920. Lenin worked out 19 of the
      conditions, which were published before the Congress.   He
      submitted the 20th to the Congress commission on July 25, 1920,
      and it was adopted. The 21st condition ran: &#8220;Members of
      the Party who reject the obligations and theses of the Communist
      International in principle should be expelled from the
      Party. This also applies to delegates of extraordinary Party
      congresses.&#8221; </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      <a id="fw07" href="#bk07" name="fw07">[7]</a> An international
      organisation set up at the Paris Peace Conference of victor
      powers in 1919. The League&#8217;s working organs were its
      Assembly, Council and Permanent Secretariat headed by a
      secretary-general. Its Covenant, a part of the Peace Treaty of
      Versailles, was signed by 44 states. It was so couched as to
      create the impression that the League served the purposes of
      peace and security, worked for a relluction of armaments, and
      opposed aggression. Actually, however, it pandered to the
      aggressors, and encouraged the arms drive and preparations for
      the Second World War. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      From 1920 to 1934, the League&#8217;s activity was hostile to
      the Soviet state and in 1920 and 1921 the League was the
      organisational centre of armed intervention against it. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      On September 15, 1934, on the initiative of French diplomats, 34
      member-states sent the Soviet Union an invitation to join the
      League. In joining, the U.S.S.R. tried to create a peace front,
      but the reactionary circles of the Western powers resisted its
      efforts. When the war broke out, the League actually ceased to
      operate, although it was formally dissolved in April 1946, under
      a special Assembly decision. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      <a id="fw08" href="#bk08" name="fw08">[8]</a> The trade
      agreement between Britain and Soviet Russia was signed on March
      16, 1921. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      <a id="fw09" href="#bk09" name="fw09">[9]</a> The
      counter-revolutionary mutiny in Kronstadt which began on
      February 28, 1921, was organised by the S.R.s, Mensheviks and
      whiteguards. It involved newly recruited sailors, most of whom
      came from the countryside and were politically ignorant and
      discontented with the gurplus appropriation system. The mutiny
      was sparked off by the economic hardships and facilitated by the
      fact that the Kronstadt Bolshevik organisation was
      weakened. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      The counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie did not dare come out
      against the Soviet power openly and used a new tactic. In an 
      attempt to deceive the people the leaders of the mutiny put
      torward the slogan &#8220;Soviets without the Bolsheviks&#8221;,
      hoping to drive out the Bolsheviks from the Soviets and
      re-establish capitalist rule in Russia. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      On March 2, the mutineers arrested the fleet command and got in
      touch with foreign imperialists who promised them military and
      financial aid. The events in Kronstadt were a threat to
      Petrograd. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      Commissar of the Red Army, Leon Trotsky, gave orders to Red Army
      units under M. N. Tukhachevsky to storm Kronstadt. With
      participation of over 300 delegates of the Tenth Party Congress
      who had military experience, led by K. Y. Voroshilov, The Red
      Army was able to crush the revolt on March 18. There was no
      dissension by any faction or tendency of the 10th Congress in
      this discision.</p>

    <p class="endnote">
      <a id="fw10" href="#bk10" name="fw10">[10]</a> On June 8, 1918,
      Samara was occupied by the mutinous Czechoslovak corps which set
      up a whiteguard-S.R.-Menshevik government, the so-called Komuch
      (A Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly). By August
      1918, Komuch had, with the aid of Czechoslovak units, occupied
      some gubernias on the Volga and in the Urals area, but that
      autumn it was defeated by the Red Army and ceased to exist. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      <a id="fw11" href="#bk11" name="fw11">[11]</a> The substitution
      of a tax in kind for the surplus appropriation system was
      discussed on February 8, 1921, at the C.C. Political Bureau,
      when N. Osinsky gave a report on &#8220;The Sowing Campaign and
      the Condition of the Peasants&#8221;. A special commission was
      set up to work out proposals for improving the peasants&#8217;
      condition. For this commission Lenin wrote the <a
      href="../../1921/feb/08.htm"><em>Rough Draft of Theses Concerning the
      Peasants</em></a> and defined the main principles on which the
      tax in kind was to be substituted for surplus
      appropriation. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      Under a Political Bureau decision of February 16, a discussion
      on the question was started in <em>Pravda</em>, the first
      articles appearing on February 17 and 26. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      On February 24, a C.C. Plenary Meeting approved a draft
      resolution on this question, which was then edited by a new
      commission. On March 3, Lenin tabled three amendments to it. On
      March 7, the C.C. Plenary Meeting discussed the draft once again
      and referred it for final editing to a commission headed by
      Lenin. It was adopted by the Tenth Congress on March 15,
      1921.</p>

      Organisations and Party Members&#8221;, published in
      <em>Izvestia of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)</em> on September 4, 1920,
      exposed the causes of the bureaucratic practices and other
      shortcomings in the Party, and outlined changes in Party work to
      develop inner-Party democracy. The measures were approved in a
      resolution, &#8220;The Current Tasks of Party
