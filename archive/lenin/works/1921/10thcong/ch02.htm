      <br /> Summing-Up Speech On

      <br />The Report Of The C.C. Of The R.C.P.(B.)
    </h3>

    <h4>March 9</h4>

    <p>
      (<em>Prolonged applause</em>.) Comrades, one would have expected
      the criticism, remarks, additions and amendments, etc., elicited
      by the report on the political activity of the Central Committee
      to concentrate on political work and political mistakes, and to
      give political advice.</p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, when you take a closer look at the debate and go
      over the main points made in it, you cannot help asking
      yourself: Was it not because the speeches were so strangely
      vapid, and almost all the speakers were from the Workers&#8217;
      Opposition, that the Congress folded up its debate so quickly?
      Indeed, just what has been said of the Central Committee&#8217;s
      political work and current political tasks? Most of the speakers
      said they belonged to the Workers&#8217; Opposition. This is no
      trifling title. And it is no trifling matter to form an
      opposition in such a Party and at such a moment!</p>

    <p>
      Comrade Kollontai, for example, said bluntly:
      &#8220;Lenin&#8217;s report evaded Kronstadt.&#8221; When I
      heard that I didn&#8217;t know what to say. Everyone present at
      this Congress knows perfectly well&#8212;newspaper reports will
      naturally not be as explicit as the speeches here are&#8212;that
      my report tied in everything&#8212;from beginning to
      end&#8212;with the lessons of Kronstadt. If anything, I deserve
      to be reproached for devoting the greater part of my report to
      the lessons that flow from the Kronstadt events, and the smaller
      part to past mistakes, political facts and crucial points in our
      work, which, in my opinion, determine our political tasks and
      help us to avoid such mistakes in the future.</p>

    <p>
      What did we hear of the lessons of Kronstadt?</p>

    <p>
      When people come forward in the name of an opposition, which
      they call a &#8220;workers&#8217;&#8221; opposition, and say
      that the 
      Central Committee has failed to steer the Party&#8217;s policy
      properly, we must tell them that we need pointers indicating
      what was wrong on the main questions, and ways of rectifying
      it. Unfortunately, we heard absolutely nothing, not a word or
      sound, about the present situation and its lessons. No one even
      touched upon the conclusion that I drew. It may be wrong, but
      the whole point of making reports at congresses is precisely to
      rectify what is wrong. The political conclusion to be drawn from
      the present situation is that the Party must be united and any
      opposition prevented. The economic conclusion is that we must
      not rest content with what has been achieved in the policy of
      reaching an agreement between the working class and the
      peasantry; we must seek new ways and put them to the test. I was
      quite specific about what we needed to do. Perhaps I was wrong,
      but nobody said a word about that. One of the speakers, I think
      it was Ryazanov, reproached me only for having suddenly sprung
      the tax on the Congress, before the ground had been prepared for
      it by discussion. That is not true. The surprising thing is that
      responsible comrades can make such statements at a Party
      Congress. The tax discussion was started in <em>Pravda</em> a
      few weeks ago. If the comrades who are fond of the game of
      opposition and like to complain that we are not providing an
      opportunity for hroad discussion did not choose to take part in
      it, they have no one to blame but themselves. We are connected
      with <em>Pravda</em>&#8217;s editorial board not only through
      Comrade Bukharin&#8217;s being a member of the Central
      Committee, but also through the Central Committee discussions of
      all the most important subjects and lines of policy. Otherwise
      there can be no political work. The Central Committee submitted
      the tax question for discussion. Articles were published in
      <em>Pravda</em>. Nobody replied to them. Those who refrained
      from replying showed that they did not wish to go into the
      matter. When, at a meeting of the Moscow Soviet&#8212;after
      these articles had been published&#8212;somebody, I do not
      remember whether it was a non-Party man or a Menshevik, got up
      and began to talk about the tax, I said: You don&#8217;t seem to
      know what&#8217;s being said in <em>Pravda</em>. It was more
      natural to say that sort of thing to a non-Party man than to a
      member of the Party. It was no accident that the discussion was
      started in <em>Pravda</em>; and 
      we shall have to deal with it here. The criticism has been
      altogether unbusiness-like. The question was put up for
      discussion, and the critics should have taken part in it;
      because they had failed to do so, their criticism is
      groundless. The same may be said of the political question. I
      repeat: all my attention was concentrated on drawing the correct
      conclusion from recent events.</p>
    
    <p>
      We are passing through a period of grave danger: as I have said
      the petty-bourgeois counter-revolution is a greater danger than
      Denikin. The comrades did not deny this. The peculiar feature of
      this counter-revolution is that it is petty-bourgeois and
      anarchistic. I insist that there is a connection between its
      ideas and slogans and those of the Workers&#8217;
      Opposition. There was no response to this from any of the
      speakers, although most of them belonged to the Workers&#8217;
      Opposition. And yet, the Workers&#8217; Opposition pamphlet,
      which Comrade Kollontai published for the Congress, serves to
      confirm my assertion better than anything else. And I suppose I
      shall have to deal chiefly with this pamphlet to explain why the
      counter-revolution, to which I have referred, is assuming an
      anarchist, petty-bourgeois form, why it is so vast and
      dangerous, and why the speakers from the Workers&#8217;
      Opposition have failed entirely to realise the danger.</p>

    <p>
      But before replying to them I want to say a word or two, before
      I forget, on another subject, namely Osinsky. This comrade, who
      has written a great deal and has brought out his own platform,
      gets up and criticises the Central Committee&#8217;s report. We
      could have expected him to criticise our principal measures, and
      this would have been very valuable for us. Instead, he said that
      we had &#8220;thrown out&#8221; Sapronov, which showed that our
      calls for unity were at variance with our deeds; and he made a
      point of stressing that two members of the Workers&#8217;
      Opposition had been elected to the Presidium. I am surprised
      that an extremely prominent Party worker and writer, who
      occupies a responsible post, can talk about such trifles, which
      are of tenth-rate importance! Osinsky has the knack of seeing
      political trickery in everything. He sees it also in the fact
      that two seats on the Presidium were given to the Workers&#8217;
      Opposition. 

    </p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;
      At a Party meeting in Moscow I called attention to the rise of
      the Workers&#8217; Opposition, and I regret that I must do so
      again now, at the Party Congress. It had revealed itself in
      October and November by bringing in the two-room system, and the
      formation of factions.</p>

    <p>
      We have repeatedly said, and I have, in particular, that our
      task is to separate the wheat from the chaff in the
      Workers&#8217; Opposition, because it has spread to some extent,
      and has damaged our work in Moscow. There was no difference of
      opinion in the Central Committee on that score. There was
      evidence of damage to our work, the start of factionalism and a
      split in November, during the two-room conference<a id="bk13"
      href="#fw13" name="bk13"><sup 	
	class="enote">[13]</sup></a>&#8212;when some met here and others down at the other end of the floor, and when I had my share of the trouble, for I had to act as errand-boy and shuttle between the rooms.</p>

    <p>
      Back in September, during the Party Conference,<a id="bk14"
      href="#fw14" name="bk14"><sup class="enote">[14]</sup></a> we
      regarded it as our task to separate the wheat from the chaff for
      the group could not be regarded as consisting entirely of good
      stuff. When we hear complaints about inadequate democracy, we
      say: it is absolutely true. Indeed, it is not heing practised
      sufficiently. We need assistance and advice in this matter. We
      need real democracy, and not just talk. We even accept those who
      call themselves the Workers&#8217; Opposition, or something
      worse, although I think that for members of the Communist Party
      no name can be worse or more disreputable. But even if they had
      adopted a much worse title, we say to ourselves: since this is a
      malaise that has affected a section of the workers we must pay
      the closest attention to it. And we should be given credit for
      the very thing that Comrade Osinsky has accused us of, though
      why he should have done so, I don&#8217;t know.</p>

    <p>
      I now come to the <a
      href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/w/o.htm#workers-opposition">Workers&#8217;
      Opposition.</a> You have admitted that you are in
      opposition. You have come to the Party Congress with Comrade <a
      href="../../../../../glossary/people/k/o.htm#kollontai-alexandre">Kollontai&#8217;s</a>
      pamphlet which is entitled <a
      href="../../../../kollonta/1921/workers-opposition/index.htm"><em>The
      Workers&#8217; Opposition</em></a>. When you sent in the final
      proofs, you knew about the Kronstadt events and the rising
      petty-bourgeois counter-revolution. And it is at a time like
      this that you come here, calling yourselves a Workers&#8217;
      Opposition. You don &#8217;t seem to realise the responsibility
      you are undertaking, and the way you are disrupting our 
      unity! What is your object? We will question you and put you
      through a test right here.</p>

    <p>
      Comrade Osinsky used this expression in a polemical sense; he
      seemed to think that we were guilty of some mistake or
      misdemeanour. Like Ryazanov, he saw political trickery in our
      policy towards the Workers&#8217; Opposition. It is not
      political trickery; it is the policy the Central Committee has
      been pursuing, and will continue to pursue. Since unhealthy
      trends and groups have arisen, let us more than redouble our
      attention to them.</p>

    <p>
      If there is anything at all sound in that opposition, we must
      make every effort to sift it from the rest. We cannot combat the
      evils of bureaucracy effectively, or practise democracy
      consistently because we lack the strength and are weak. We must
      enlist those who can help us in this matter, and expose and sift
      out those who produce such pamphlets on the pretext of helping
      us.</p>

    <p>
      This task of sifting is being facilitated at the Party
      Congress. Representatives of the ailing group have been elected
      to the Presidium and these &#8220;poor&#8221;,
      &#8220;wronged&#8221;, and &#8220;banished&#8221; people will no
      longer dare to complain and wail. There&#8217;s the rostrum, up
      on it, and let&#8217;s have your answer! You have spoken more
      than anyone else. Now let us see what you have in store for us,
      with this looming danger, which, you admit, is a greater one
      than Denikin! What have you come up with? What is the nature of
      your criticism? We must have this test now, and I think it will
      be the final one. We have had enough of that sort of thing! The
      Party will not be trifled with in this way! Whoever comes to the
      Congress with such a pamphlet is trifling with the Party. You
      can&#8217;t play that kind of game when hundreds of thousands of
      demoralised veterans are playing havoc with our
      economy&#8212;the Party will not stand for such treatment. You
      can&#8217;t behave that way. You must realise that, and put a
      stop to it!</p>

    <p>
      After these preliminary remarks about the election to the
      Presidium and the character of the Workers&#8217; Opposition  I
      want to draw your attention to Comrade Kollontai&#8217;s
      pamphlet. It really deserves your attention, for it sums up the
      activity this opposition has been carrying on for several
      months, or the disintegration it has caused. It was 
      said here, by a comrade from Samara, I think, that I had stuck
      the label of syndicalism on the Workers&#8217; Opposition, in an
      &#8220;administrative&#8221; fashion. The reference is
      altogether misplaced, and we must investigate which of the
      questions calls for an administrative solution. Comrade Milonov
      tried to score with a terrifying catchword, but it fell flat. He
      said that I stuck on a label in &#8220;administrative&#8221;
      fashion. I have said before that at our meetings Comrade
      Shlyapnikov and others have accused me of
      &#8220;intimidating&#8221; people with the word
      &#8220;syndicalism&#8221;. When this was mentioned at one of our
      discussions, at the Miners&#8217; Congress, I think, I replied
      to Comrade Shlyapnikov: &#8220;Do you hope to take in any
      grown-ups?&#8221; After all, Comrade Shlyapnikov and I have
      known each other for many, many years, ever since the period of
      our underground work and emigration&#8212;how can he say that I
      am trying to intimidate anyone by characterising certain
      deviations? And when I say that the stand of the Workers&#8217;
      Opposition is wrong, and that it is syndicalism&#8212;what has
      administrating got to do with it?! And why does Comrade
      Kollontai write that I have been bandying the word
      &#8220;syndicalism&#8221; about in frivolous fashion? She ought
      to produce some proof before saying anything like that. I am
      prepared to allow that my proof is wrong, and that Comrade
      Kollontai&#8217;s statement is weightier&#8212;I am prepared to
      believe that. But we must have some little proof&#8212;not in
      the form of words about intimidating or administrating (which,
      unfortunately, my official duties compel me to engage in a great
      deal), but in the form of a definite reply, refuting my
      accusation that the Workers&#8217; Opposition is a deviation
      towards syndicalism.</p>

    <p>
      I made it before the whole Party, with a full sense of
      responsibility, and it was printed in a pamphlet in 250,000
      copies, and everyone has read it. Evidently, all the comrades
      have prepared for this Congress, and they should know that the
      syndicalist deviation is an anarchist deviation, and that the
      Workers&#8217; Opposition, which is hiding behind the backs of
      the proletariat, is a petty-bourgeois, anarchist element.</p>

    <p>
      That it has been penetrating into the broad masses is evident,
      and the Party Congress has thrown light on this fact. That this
      element has become active is proved by 
      Comrade Kollontai&#8217;s pamphlet and Comrade
      Shlyapnikov&#8217;s theses. And this time you can&#8217;t get
      away with talk about being a true proletarian, as Comrade
      Shlyapnikov is in the habit of doing.</p>

    <p>
      Comrade Kollontai starts her pamphlet with the following:
      &#8220;The opposition,&#8221; we read on page one,
      &#8220;consists of the advanced section of the class-organised
      proletarians, who are Communists.&#8221; A delegate from Siberia
      told the Miners&#8217; Congress<a id="bk15" href="#fw15"
      name="bk15"><sup class="enote">[15]</sup></a> that over there
      they had discussed the same questions as were being discussed in
      Moscow, and Comrade Kollontai mentions this in her pamphlet:
      </p>


    <p class="quote">
      &#8220;&#8217;We had no idea that there were disagreements and
      discussions in Moscow about the role of the trade unions,&#8217;
      a delegate from Siberia told the Miners&#8217; Congress,
      &#8217;but we were set astir by the same questions that you are
      faced with over here.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Further:</p>

 
    <p class="quote">
      
   &#8220;The Workers&#8217; Opposition has the backing of the proletarian masses, or, to be more precise: it is the class-welded, class-conscious and class-consistent section of our industrial proletariat.&#8221;</p>


    <p>
      Well, thank heaven, we now know that Comrade Kollontai and
      Comrade Shlyapnikov are &#8220;class-welded&#8221; and
      &#8220;class conscious&#8221;. But, comrades, when you say and
      write such things you must have some sense of proportion!
      Comrade Kollontai writes on page 25, and this is one of the main
      points of the Workers&#8217; Opposition theses, the following:
      </p>

    <p class="quote">
      &#8220;The organisation of the management of the national
      economy is the function of an All-Russia Congress of Producers
      organised in trade and industrial unions, which shall elect a
      central body to run the whole of the national economy of the
      Republic.&#8221; </p>

    <p>
      That is the very thesis of the Workers&#8217; Opposition that I
      have quoted in every case in the discussion and in the press. I
      must say that after reading it I did not trouble to read the
      rest, as that would have been a waste of time; for that thesis
      made it quite clear that these people had reached the limit, and
      that theirs is a petty-bourgeois, anarchist element. Now, in the
      light of the Kronstadt events, that thesis sounds queerer than
      ever.</p>

    <p>
      At the Second Congress of the Comintern last summer, 
      I pointed to the significance of the resolution on the role of
      the Communist Party. It is a resolution uniting the Communist
      workers and the Communist Parties of the world. It explains
      everything. Does that mean that we are fencing off the Party
      from the whole of the working class, which is definitely
      exercising a dictatorship? That is what certain
      &#8220;Leftists&#8221; and very many syndicalists think, and the
      idea is now widespread. It is the product of petty-bourgeois
      ideology. The theses of the Workers&#8217; Opposition fly in the
      face of the decision of the Second Congress of the Comintern on
      the Communist Party&#8217;s role in operating the dictatorship
      of the proletariat. It is syndicalism because&#8212;consider
      this carefully&#8212;our proletariat has been largely declassed;
      the terrible crises and the closing down of the factories have
      compelled people to flee from starvation. The workers have
      simply abandoned their factories; they have had to settle down
      in the country and have ceased to be workers. Are we not aware
      of the fact that the unprecedented crises, the Civil War, the
      disruption of proper relations between town and country and the
      cessation of grain deliveries have given rise to a trade in
      small articles made at the big factories&#8212;such as cigarette
      lighters&#8212;which are exchanged for cereals, because the
      workers are starving, and no grain is being delivered? Have we
      not seen this happen in the Ukraine, or in Russia? That is the
      economic source of the proletariat&#8217;s declassing and the
      inevitable rise of petty-bourgeois, anarchist trends.</p>

    <p>
      The experience of all our hardships tells us how desperately
      hard it is to combat them. After two and a half years of the
      Soviet power we came out in the Communist International and told
      the world that the dictatorship of the proletariat would not
      work except through the Communist Party. At the time, the
      anarchists and syndicalists furiously attacked us and said:
      &#8220;You see, this is what they think&#8212;a Communist Party
      is needed to operate the proletarian dictatorship.<a id="bk16"
      href="#fw16" name="bk16"><sup class="enote">[16]</sup></a> But
      we said this before the whole Communist International. After all
      this, you have these &#8220;class conscious and
      class-welded&#8221; people coming and telling us that &#8220;the
      organisation of the management of the national economy is the
      function of an All-Russia Congress of Producers&#8221; (Comrade
      Kollontai&#8217;s pamphlet). What is this &#8220;All-
      Russia Congress of Producers&#8221;? Are we going to waste more
      time on that sort of opposition in the Party? I think we have
      had enough of this discussion! All the arguments about freedom
      of speech and freedom to criticise, of which the pamphlet is
      full and which run through all the speeches of the
      Workers&#8217; Opposition, constitute nine-tenths of the meaning
      of these speeches, which have no particular meaning at all. They
      are all words of the same order. After all, comrades, we ought
      to discuss not only words, but also their meaning. You
      can&#8217;t fool us with words like &#8220;freedom to
      criticise&#8221;. When we were told that there were symptoms of
      a malaise in the Party, we said that this deserved our redoubled
      attention: the malaise is undoubtedly there, let us help to cure
      it; but tell us how you intend to go about it. We have spent
      quite a lot of time in discussion, and I must say that the point
      is now being driven farther home with &#8220;rifles&#8221; than
      with the opposition&#8217;s theses. Comrades, this is no time to
      have an opposition. Either you&#8217;re on this side, or on the
      other, but then your weapon must be a gun, and not an
      opposition. This follows from the objective situation, and you
      mustn&#8217;t blame us for it. Comrades, let&#8217;s not have an
      opposition just now! I think the Party Congress will have to
      draw the conclusion that the opposition&#8217;s time has run out
      and that the lid&#8217;s on it. We want no more oppositions!
      (<em>Applause</em>.)</p>

    <p>
      This group has long been free to criticise. And now, at this
      Party Congress, we ask: What are the results and the content of
      your criticism? What have you taught the Party by your
      criticism? We are prepared to enlist the services of those of
      you who stand closest to the masses, the really class-welded and
      class-mature masses. If Comrade Oinsky regards this as political
      trickery he will be isolated, for the rest will regard it as a
      real help to Party members. We must really help those who live
      with the workers&#8217; masses, who have intimate knowledge of
      them, who have experience and can advise the Central
      Committee. Let them call themselves what they like&#8212;it
      makes no difference&#8212;as long as they help in the work, as
      long as they help us, instead of playing at opposition and
      insisting on having groups and factions at all costs. But if
      they continue this game of opposition, the Party will have to
      expel them.</p>
 
    <p>
      And when on this very same page of her pamphlet Comrade
      Kollontai writes in bold type about &#8220;lack of confidence in
      the working class&#8221;, the idea is that they are a real
      &#8220;workers&#8217;&#8221; opposition. There is an even more
      striking expression of this idea on page 36: </p>

    <p class="quote">
      &#8220;The Workers&#8217; Opposition cannot, and must not, make
      any concessions. This does not mean calling for a
      split. . . . No, its aim is different. Even in the event of
      defeat at the Coneress, it must remain within the Party and
      firmly defend its point of view, step by step, saving the Party
      and straightening out its line.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Even in the event of defeat at the
      Congress&#8221;&#8212;my word, what foresight!
      (<em>Laughter</em>.) You will pardon me if I take the liberty of
      saying, on my oun behalf, that I am sure that is something the
      Party Congress will certainly not permit! (<em>Applause</em>.)
      Everyone has the right to straighten out the Party&#8217;s line,
      and you have had every opportunity of doing so.</p>

    <p>
      The condition has been laid down at the Party Congress that
      there must not be the slightest suspicion that we want to expel
      anybody. We welcome every assistance in getting democracy
      working, but when the people are exhausted it will take more
      than talk to do it. Everyone who wants to help is to be
      welcomed; but when they say that they will &#8220;make no
      concessions&#8221; and will make efforts to save the Party,
      while remaining in it, we say: yes, if you are allowed to stay!
      (<em>Applause</em>.)</p>

    <p>
      In this case, we have no right to leave any room for
      ambiguity. We certainly need help in combating bureaucracy,
      safeguarding democracy, and extending contacts with the truly
      working-class masses. We can and must make
      &#8220;concessions&#8221; in this respect. And though they keep
      saying that they will not make any concessions, we shall repeat:
      We will. That&#8217;s not making concessions but helping the
      workers&#8217; Party. In this way, we shall win over all the
      sound and proletarian elements in the Workers&#8217; Opposition
      to the side of the Party, leaving outside the
      &#8220;class-conscious&#8221; authors of syndicalist
      speeches. (<em>Applause</em>.) This has been done in Moscow. The
      Moscow Gubernia Conference last November ended up in two rooms:
      some met in one, others, in another. That was the eve of a
      split. The last Moscow Conference said, &#8220;We will take from
      the Workers&#8217; 
      Opposition those we want, and not those they want &#8220;,
      because we need the assistance of men who are connected with the
      masses of workers and who can teach us how to combat the evils
      of bureaucracy in practice. This is a difficult task. I think
      the Party Congress should take note of the Muscovites&#8217;
      experience and stage a test, not only on this point, but on all
      the points of the agenda. As a result, the people who declare
      that they &#8220;will make no concessions&#8221; must be told:
      &#8220;But the Party will.&#8221; We must all pull together. By
      means of this policy we shall sift the sound elements from the
      unsound in the Workers&#8217; Opposition, and the Party will be
      strengthened.</p>

    <p>
      Just think: it was said here that production should be run by an
      &#8220;All-Russia Congress of Producers&#8221;. I find myself
      groping for words to describe this nonsense, but am reassured by
      the fact that all the Party workers present here are also Soviet
      functionaries who have been doing their work for the revolution
      for one, two or three years. It is not worth criticising that
      sort of thing in their presence. When they hear such tedious
      speeches they close the discussion, because it is frivolous to
      speak of an &#8220;All-Russia Congress of Producers&#8221;
      running the national economy. A proposal of that kind could be
      made in a country where the political power has been taken but
      no start has been made on the work. We have made a start. And it
      is a curious fact that on page 33 of this pamphlet we find the
      following: </p>

    <p class="quote">
      &#8220;The Workers&#8217; Opposition is not so ignorant as to
      disregard the great role of technique and of technically trained
      forces. . . . It has no intention to set up its organs of
      administration of the national economy elected by the
      Producers&#8217; Congress and then to dissolve the economic
      councils, chief administrations and central boards. No, the idea
      is quite different: it is to subordinate these necessary,
      technically valuable centres of administration to its guidance,
      assign theoretical tasks to them and use them in the same way as
      the factory owners once used the services of technical
      experts.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      In other words, Comrade Kollontai and Comrade Shlyapnikov, and
      their &#8220;class-welded&#8221; followers, are to subordinate
      to their necessary guidance the economic councils, chief
      administrations and central boards&#8212;all the Rykovs, Nogins
      and other &#8220;nonentities&#8221;&#8212;and assign to them
      theoretical tasks! Comrades, are we to take that seriously? If 
you have had any &#8220;theoretical tasks&#8221;, why had you not assigned them before? Why did we proclaim freedom of discussion? It was not merely to engage in verbal exchanges. During the war we used to say: &#8220;This is not the time for criticism: Wrangel is out there. We correct our mistakes by beating Wrangel.&#8221; After the war, we hear shouts of &#8220;We want freedom of discussion!&#8221; When we ask, &#8220;Tell us our mistakes!&#8221;, we are told, &#8220;The economic councils and chief administrations must not be dissolved; they must be assigned theoretical tasks.&#8221; Comrade Kiselyov, as a representative of the &#8220;class-welded &#8220; Workers &#8217; Opposition, was left in an insignificant minority at the Miners&#8217; Congress, but, when he was head of the Chief Administration of the Textile Industry, why did he not teach us how to combat the evils of bureaucracy? Why did not Comrade Shlyapnikov, when he was a People&#8217;s Commissar, and Comrade Kollontai, when she too was a People&#8217;s Commissar, why did they not teach us how to combat the evils of bureaucracy? We know that we have a touch of bureaucracy, and we, who have to deal with this bureaucratic machine at first hand, suffer as a result. You sign a paper&#8212;but how is it applied in practice? How do you check up on it, when the bureaucratic machine is so enormous? If you know how to make it smaller, dear comrades, please share your knowledge with us! You have a desire to argue, but you give us nothing apart from general statements. Instead, you indulge in demagogy pure and simple. For it is sheer demagogy to say: &#8220;The specialists are ill-treating the workers; the workers are leading a life of penal servitude in a toilers&#8217; republic.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Comrades, I entreat you all to read this pamphlet. You could not
      find a better argument against the Workers&#8217; Opposition
      than Comrade Kollontai&#8217;s pamphlet, <em>The Workers&#8217;
      Opposition</em>. You will see that this is really no way to
      approach the question. We all admit that bureaucratic practices
      are a vexed question, and as much is stated in our Party
      Programme. It is very easy to criticise the chief
      administrations and economic councils, but your kind of
      criticism leads the masses of non-Party workers to think they
      should be dissolved. The Socialist-Rovolutionaries seize upon
      this Some Ukrainian comrades have told me that Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, at their conference,<a id="bk17"
      href="#fw17" name="bk17"><sup class="enote">[17]</sup></a>
      formulated their proposals in exactly the same way. And what
      about the Kronstadt resolutions<a id="bk18" href="#fw18"
      name="bk18"><sup class="enote">[18]</sup></a>? You have not all
      read them? We will show them to you: they say the same thing. I
      emphasised the danger of Kronstadt because it lies precisely in
      the fact that the change demanded was apparently very slight:
      &#8220;The Bolsheviks must go . . . we will correct the regime a
      little.&#8221; That is what the Kronstadt rebels are
      demanding. But what actually happened was that Savinkov arrived
      in Revel, the Paris newspapers reported the events a fortnight
      before they actually occurred, and a whiteguard general appeared
      on the scene. That is what actually happened. All revolutions
      have gone that way. That is why we are saying: Since we are
      faced with that sort of thing, we must unite, and, as I said in
      my first speech, counter it with rifles, no matter how innocent
      it may appear to be. To this the Workers&#8217; Opposition does
      not reply, but says: &#8220;We shall not dissolve the economic
      councils but &#8217;subordinate them to our
      guidance&#8217;.&#8221; The &#8220;All-Russia Congress of
      .Producers&#8221; is to subordinate to its guidance the Economic
      Council&#8217;s 71 chief administrations. I ask you: is that a
      joke? Can we take them seriously? This is the petty-bourgeois,
      anarchist element not only among the masses of the workers, but
      also in our own Party; and that is something we cannot tolerate
      in any circumstances. We have allowed ourselves a luxury: we
      gave these people the opportunity to express their opinions in
      the greatest possible detail and have heard their side of it
      several times. When I had occasion to debate with Comrades
      Trotsky and Kiselyov at the Second Miners&#8217; Congress, two
      points of view were definitely revealed. The Workers&#8217;
      Opposition said: &#8220;Lenin and Trotsky will unite.&#8221;
      Trotsky came out and said: &#8220;Those who fail to understand
      that it is necessary to unite are against the Party; of course
      we will unite, because we are men of the Party.&#8221; I
      supported him. Of course, Comrade Trotsky and I differed; and
      when more or less equal groups appear within the Central
      Committee, the Party will pass judgement, and in a way that will
      make us unite in accordance with the Party&#8217;s will and
      instructions. Those are the statements Comrade Trotsky and I
      made at the Miners&#8217; Congress, and repeat here; but the
      Workers&#8217; Opposition says: &#8220;We will make no
      concessions, but we will remain in the Party.&#8221; No, that
      trick won&#8217;t work! (<em>Applause</em>.) I repeat that in
      combating the evils of bureaucracy we welcome the assistance of
      every worker, whatever he may call himself, if he is sincere in
      his desire to help. This help is highly desirable if sincere. In
      this sense we will make &#8220;concessions&#8221; (I take the
      word in quotation marks). No matter how provocative the
      statements against us, we shall make &#8220;concessions&#8221;
      because we know how hard the going is. We cannot dissolve the
      economic councils and chief administrations. It is absolutely
      untrue to say that we have no confidence in the working class
      and that we are keeping the workers out of the governing
      bodies. We are on the look-out for every worker who is at all
      fit for managerial work; we are glad to have him and give him a
      trial. If the Party has no confidence in the working class and
      does not allow workers to occupy responsible posts, it ought to
      be ousted! Go on, be logical and say it! I have said that that
      is not true: we are on our last legs for want of men and we are
      propared to take any assistance, with both hands, from any
      efficient man, especially if he is a worker. But we have no men
      of this type, and this creates the ground for anarchy. We must
      keep up the fight against the evils of bureaucracy&#8212;and it
      demands hundreds of thousands of men.</p>

    <p>
      Our Programme formulates the task of combating the evils of
      bureaucracy as one of extremely long duration. The wider the
      dispersal of the peasantry, the more inevitable are bureaucratic
      practices at the centre.</p>

    <p>
      It is easy to write things like this: &#8220;There is something
      rotten in our Party.&#8221; You know what weakening the Soviet
      apparatus means when there are two million Russian
      &eacute;migr&eacute;s abroad. They were driven out by the Civil
      War. They have gratified us by holding their meetings in Berlin,
      Paris, London, and all the other capitals but ours. They support
      this element that is called the small producer, the
      petty-bourgeois element.</p>

    <p>
      We shall do everything that can be done to eliminate
      bureaucratic practices by promoting workers from below, and we
      shall accept every piece of practical advice on this
      matter. Even if we give this the inappropriate name of
      &#8220;concessions&#8221;, as some here have done, there is no
      doubt 
      that, despite this pamphlet, 99 per cent of the Congress will
      say, &#8220;In spite of this we will make
      &#8217;concessions&#8217; and win over all that is sound.&#8221;
      Take your place by the side of the workers and teach us how to
      combat the evils of bureaucracy, if you know how to do it better
      than we do; but don&#8217;t talk as Shlyapnikov has done. That
      is not the sort of thing that one can brush aside. I shall not
      deal with the theoretical part of his speech because Kollontai
      said the same thing. I shall deal with the facts he quoted. He
      said that potatoes were rotting, and asked why Tsyurupa was not
      being prosecuted.</p>

    <p>
      But I ask: Why is Shlyapnikov not prosecuted for making such
      statements? Are we seriously discussing discipline and unity in
      an organised Party, or are we at a meeting of the Kronstadt
      type? For his is a Kronstadt, anarchist type of statement, to
      which the response is a gun. We organised members of the Party,
      have come here to rectify our mistakes. If Shlyapnikov thinks
      that Tsyurupa ought to be prosecuted, why had he not, as an
      organised member of the Party, lodged a complaint with the
      Control Commission? When we were setting up the Control
      Commission, we said: The Central Committee is swamped with
      administrative work. Let us elect people who enjoy the
      confidence of the workers, who will not have so much
      administrative work and will be able to examine complaints on
      behalf of the Central Committee. This created a means of
      developing criticism and rectifying mistakes. If Tsyurupa was so
      wrong why was not a complaint lodged with the Control
      Commission? Instead, Shlyapnikov comes to the Congress, the most
      responsible assembly of the Party and the Republic, and starts
      hurling accusations about rotting potatoes, and asking why
      Tsyurupa is not being prosecuted. But I ask, doesn&#8217;t the
      Defence Department make any mistakes? Are not batt]es lost and
      waggons and supplies abandoned? Shall we then prosecute the
      military workers? Comrade Shlyapnikov comes here and hurls
      accusations which he himself does not believe, and which he
      cannot prove. Potatoes are rotting. Of course, many mistakes
      will be made, for our machinery wants adjustment, and our
      transport is not running smoothly. But when instead of a
      rectification of our mistakes such accusations are hurled at
      random, and when, 
in addition&#8212;as several comrades here have noted&#8212;there is an undertone of malice in this question of why Tsyurupa is not being prosecuted, then I say: Why not prosecute us, the Central Committee? We think that such talk is demagogy. Either proceedings should be started against Tsyurupa and us, or against Shlyapnikov; but no work can be done in such a spirit. When Party comrades talk as Shlyapnikov has done here&#8212;and he always talks like that at other meetings&#8212;and Comrade Kollontai&#8217;s pamphlet says the same thing, although she mentions no names, we say: We cannot go on like this, for it is the kind of demagogy that the Makhno anarchists and the Kronstadt elements jump at. We are both members of the Party, and both of us are standing before this most responsible tribunal. If Tsyurupa has committed an unlawful act and we, the Central Committee, have condoned it, then why not come out with a definite charge, instead of throwing about words that will be caught up here, in Moscow, tomorrow, and immediately carried by the grapevine telegraph to the bourgeoisie. Tomorrow all the gossips in the Soviet offices will be rubbing their hands in glee and repeating your words with delight. If Tsyurupa is the kind of man Shlyapnikov accuses him of being, and if, as he demands, he ought to be prosecuted, then I say that we must seriously ponder over his words; such accusations are not lightly made. Those who make accusations of this sort should be either removed from the Party or told: We are putting you on this potato job; you go to such and such a gubernia and let&#8217;s see whether you have less rotting potatoes than in the gubernias under Tsyurupa&#8217;s charge. </p>

                    Preliminary Draft Resolution On Improving<br /> 
                    The Condition Of Workers And Needy Peasants</h3>

    <p>
      The exhaustion caused by the privation and the calamities and
      havoc of the seven-year war, and the overstrain due to the
      virtually superhuman exertions on the part of the working class
      of Russia over the past three and a half years, have now been so
      aggravated that they demand urgent measures on the part of the
      Soviet power.</p>

    <p>
      The Tenth Congress of the R.C.P. accordingly demands that the
      whole Party and all Party and Soviet establishments should
      redouble their attention to this question and immediately work
      out measures to improve the condition of the workers and ease
      their hardships at all costs.</p>

    <p>
      The Congress approves of the decision taken by the Central
      Committee and the Soviet Government to release a part of the
      gold reserve for the purchase of consumer goods for the workers,
      and demands an extension of this measure and an immediate
      amendment, with that end in view, of our import plan.</p>

    <p>
      The Congress authorises the Central Committee to set up a
      special Central Commission to implement urgent measures to
      improve the condition of the workers, which should be organised
      in such a way as to work in close contact with, on the one hand,
      the Central Committee of the R.C.P. and the All-Russia Central
      Council of Trade Unions, and, on the other, with the Council of
      People&#8217;s Commissars and the Council of Labour and Defence,
      for the swiftest implementation of the measures to be adopted,
      and to allow the workers themselves to exercise control over the
      implementation of these measures. The Commission must set up
      sub-commissions in the Commissariats which are in the best
      position right away to assign a part of their machinery and 
      resources to help improve the condition of the workers
      (People&#8217;s Commissariats for Foreign Trade, Food, Defence,
      and Health, the Government Buildings Committee,
      etc.). Sub-commissions are especially needed in the gubernias
      where industrial workers are chiefly concentrated. The Congress
      entrusts the Central Committee and Party workers of the
      Commissariats concerned to work out an ordinance governing the
      operation of these commissions without delay.</p>

    <p>
      In view of the acute hardships inflicted on the peasantry by the
      crop failure&#8212;in very many cases aggravated by the
      demobilisation of the army&#8212;the Tenth Congress authorises
      the Central Committee to take, through the Council of
      People&#8217;s Commissars and the All-Russia Central Executive
      Committee, measures similar to those outlined above to improve
      the condition of needy peasants, without confining itself to the
      commission earlier set up for that purpose by the All-Russia
      Central Executive Committee.</p>

    <h3>5<br />
      Speech On The Trade Unions</h3> 

    <h4>March 14</h4>

    <p>
      Comrades, Comrade Trotsky was particularly polite in his
      polemics with me today and reproached me for being, or said that
      I was, extremely cautious. I thank him for the compliment, but
      regret that I cannot return it. On the contrary, I must speak of
      my incautious friend, so as to express my attitude to the
      mistake which has caused me to waste so much time, and which is
      now making us continue the debate on the trade union question,
      instead of dealing with more urgent matters. Comrade Trotsky had
      his final say in the discussion on the trade union question in
      <em>Pravda</em> of January 29, 1921. In his article,
      &#8220;There Are Disagreements, But Why Confuse Things?&#8221;,
      he accused me of being responsible for this confusion by asking
      who started it all. The accusation recoils on Trotsky, for he is
      trying to shift the blame. The whole of his article was based on
      the claim that he had raised the question of the role of the
      trade unions in production, and that this is the subject that
      ought to have been discussed. This is not true; it is not this
      that has caused the disagreements, and made them painful. And
      however tedious it may be after the discussion to have to repeat
      it again and again&#8212;true, I took part in it for only one
      month&#8212;I must restate that that was not the starting point;
      it started with the &#8220;shake-up&#8221; slogan that was
      proclaimed at the Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions on
      November 2-6.<a id="bk19" href="#fw19" name="bk19"><sup
      class="enote">[19]</sup></a> Already at that time it was
      realised by every one who had not overlooked Rudzutak&#8217;s
      resolution&#8212;and among those were the members of the Central
      Committee, including myself&#8212;that no disagreements could be
      found on the role of the trade unions in production. But the
      three month discussion revealed them. They existed, and they
      were a political mistake. During a discussion at the Bolshoi
      Theatre, Comrade Trotsky accused me before responsible Party
      workers of disrupting the discussion.<a id="bk20" href="#fw20"
      name="bk20"><sup class="enote">[20]</sup></a> I take that as a
      compliment: I did try to disrupt the discussion in the form it
      was being conducted, because with a severe spring ahead of us
      such pronouncements were harmful. Only the blind could have
      failed to see that.</p>

    <p>
      Comrade Trotsky now laughs at my asking who started it all, and
      is surprised that I should reproach him for refusing to serve on
      the commission. I did it because this is very important, Comrade
      Trotsky, very  important, indeed; your refusal to serve on the
      trade union commission was a violation of Central Committee
      discipline. And when Trotsky talks about it, the result is not a
      controversy, but a shake up of the Party, and a generation of
      bitter feeling; it leads to extremes&#8212;Comrade Trotsky used
      the expression &#8220;diabolical rage&#8221;. I recall an
      expression used by Comrade Holtzmann&#8212;I will not quote it
      because the word &#8220;diabolical&#8221; calls to mind
      something fiendish, whereas Holtzmann reminds one of something
      angelic. There is nothing &#8220;diabolical&#8221; about it, but
      we must not forget that both sides go to extremes, and, what is
      much more monstrous, some of the nicest comrades have gone to
      extremes. But when Comrade Trotsky&#8217;s authority was added
      to this, and when in a public speech on December 25 he said that
      the Congress must choose between two trends, such words are
      unpardonable! They constitute the political mistake over which
      we are flghting. And it is na&#239;ve for people to try to be
      witty about two-room conferences. I should like to see the wag
      who says that Congress delegates are forbidden to confer to
      prevent their votes from being split. That would be too much of
      an exaggeration. It was Comrade Trotsky and Tsektran&#8217;s
      political mistake to raise the &#8220;shake-up&#8221; question
      and to do it in an entirely wrong way. That was a political
      mistake, and it is yet to be rectified. As regards transport, we
      have a resolution.<a id="bk21" href="#fw21" name="bk21"><sup
      class="enote">[21]</sup></a></p>

    <p>
      What we are discussing is the trade union movement, and the
      relationship between the vanguard of the working class and the
      proletariat. There is nothing discreditable in our dismissing
      anybody from a high post. This casts no reflection upon
      anybody. If you have made a mistake the Congress will recognise
      it assuch and will restore mutual relations and mutual
      confidence between the vanguard of the working class and the
      workers&#8217; mass. That is the meaning of the &#8220;Platform
      of Ten&#8221;.<a id="bk22" href="#fw22" name="bk22"><sup
      class="enote">[22]</sup></a> It is of no importance that there
      are things in it that can be substituted, and that this is
      emphasised by Trotsky and enlarged upon by Ryazanov. Someone
      said in a speech that there is no evidence of Lenin&#8217;s
      having taken a hand in the platform or of his having taken any
      part in drafting it. I say to this: If I had a hand, by writing
      or phoning, in everything I sign, I would have gone mad long
      ago. I say that in order to estab]ish mutual relations and
      mutual confidence between the vanguard of the working class and
      the workers&#8217; mass, it was necessary, if Tsektran had made
      a mistake&#8212;and anyone can make a mistake&#8212;to rectify
      it. But it is a source of political danger to defend the
      mistake. We would have been faced with political bankruptcy if
      we had not done everything we could to turn the attitudes
      expressed here by Kutuzov to the service of
      democracy. Persuasion must come before coercion. We must make
      every effort to persuade people before applying coercion. We
      were not able to carry conviction to the broad masses, and
      disturbed the correct relationship between them and the
      vanguard.</p>

    <p>
      When people like Kutuzov devote part of a business-like speech
      to pointing out the scandalous bureaucratic practices in our
      machinery we say: That is true, our state is one with
      bureaucratic distortions. And we invite the non-Party workers to
      join us in righting them. I must say here that we should enlist
      comrades like Kutuzov for this work and promote them. That is
      the lesson of our experience.</p>

    <p>
      As for the syndicalist deviation&#8212;it is ridiculous. That is
      all we have to say to Shlyapnikov, who maintained that the
      &#8220;All-Russia Congress of Producers&#8221;, a demand set
      down in black and white in their platform and confirmed by
      Kollontai, can be upheld by a reference to Engels. Engels speaks
      of a communist society which will have no classes, and will
      consist only of producers.<a id="bk23" href="#fw23"
      name="bk23"><sup class="enote">[23]</sup></a> Do we now have
      classes? Yes, we do. Do we have a class struggle? Yes, and a
      most furious one! To come in the midst of this furious class
      struggle and talk about an &#8220;All-Russia Congress of
      Producers&#8221;,&#8212; isn&#8217;t that a syndicalist
      deviation which must be emphatically and irrevocably condemned?
      We saw that in this platform hurly-burly even Bukharin was
      tripped up by the one-third nomination proposal. Comrades, in
      the history of the Party we must not forget such waverings.</p>

    <p>
      And now, since the Workers&#8217; Opposition has defended
      democracy, and has made some sound demands, we shall do our
      utmost to mend our fences with it; and the Congress as such
      should make a definite selection. You say that we are not doing
      enough to combat the evils of bureaucracy&#8212;come and help
      us, come closer and help us in the fight; but it is not a
      Marxist, not a communist notion to propose an &#8220;All-Russia
      Congress of Producers&#8221;. The Workers Opposition, with
      Ryazanov&#8217;s help, is putting a false construction on our
      Programme which says: &#8220;The trade unions <em>should
      eventually</em> arrive at a <em>de facto</em> concentration in
      their hands of the whole administration of the whole national
      economy, as a single economic entity.&#8221;<a id="bk24"
      href="#fw24" name="bk24"><sup class="enote">[24]</sup></a>
      Exaggerating, as he always does, Shlyapnikov thinks that it will
      take us twenty-five centuries. . . . The Programme says: the
      trade unions &#8220;should eventually arrive&#8221;, and when a
      Congress says that this has been done, the demand will have been
      carried out.</p>

    <p>
      Comrades, if the Congress now declares before the proletariat of
      the whole of Russia and of the whole world that it regards the
      proposals of the Workers&#8217; Opposition as a syndicalist
      semi-deviation, I am sure that all the truly proletarian and
      sound elements in the opposition will follow us and help us to
      regain the confidence of the masses, which has been shaken by
      Tsektran&#8217;s slight mistake. I am sure that we shall
      strengthen and rally our ranks in a common effort and march
      forward together to the hard struggle that lies ahead. And
      marching forward unanimously, with firmness and resolution, we
      shall win out. (<em>Applause</em>.)</p>

      <a id="fw13" href="#bk13" name="fw13">[13]</a> <em>A Moscow
      Gubernia Conference of the R.C.P.(B.)</em> took place in the
      Kremlin from November 20 to 22, 1920. It was attended by 289
      delegates with voice and vote, and 89, with voice only. On its
      agenda were reports on the activity of the Moscow Party
      Committee, the international and domestic situation and the
      Party&#8217;s tasks, the state of the country&#8217;s economy,
      and production propaganda. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      The atmosphere at the Conference was very tense, because the
      Bolsheviks had to fight against the anti-Party groups of
      Democratic Centralism, the Workers&#8217; Opposition and the
      Ignatovites, who made demagogic attacks on the Party&#8217;s
      policy. The Workers&#8217; Opposition tried to get as many of
      their supporters on the Moscow Committee as possible and called
      a special meeting of worker delegates in the Mitrofanyevsky Hall
      of the Great Kremlin Palace, while the other delegates had a
      meeting in the Sverdlovsky Hall. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      At the afternoon sitting on November 21, Lenin spoke on the
      international and domestic situation and the Party&#8217;s
      tasks, and later, on the elections to the Moscow Committee. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      Led by Lenin, the Conference beat back the anty-Party
      attacks. </p>

      <a id="fw14" href="#bk14" name="fw14">[14]</a> <em>The Ninth
      All-Russia Conference of the R.C.P.(B.)</em> was held in Moscow
      from September 22 to 25, 1920. Its 241 delegates (116 with voice
      and vote, and 125, with voice only) represented 700,000 Party
      members. On its agenda were: 1) Report by a representative of
      the Polish Comlllunists; 2) Political report of the C.C., 3)
      Organisational report of the C.C., 4) The current tasks of Party
      organisation; 5) Report of a commission on the study of the
      history of the Party, 6) Report on the Second Congress of the
      Comintern. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      At the first sitting Lenin gave the political report of the
      Central Committee, dealing mainly with peace negotiations with
      Poland and preparations for defeating Wrangel. The Conference
      adopted a unanimous resolution on the terms of a peace treaty
      with Poland. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      Having discussed the current tasks of Party organisation, the
      Conference rejected the views of the Democratic Centralism
      group, which tried to discredit the one-man management system in
      industry, and to oppose Party discipline and the Party&#8217;s
      leading role in the Soviets and trade unions. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      A resolution, &#8220;The Current Tasks of Party
      Organisation&#8221;, motioned by Lenin, outlined some measures
      for strengthening the Party and its leading role in the Soviet
      state, and developing inner-Party democracy, and also measures
      against the excesses of bureaucracy in Soviet administrative
      bodies and economic agencies. The Conference deemed it necessary
      to set up a Control Commission alongside the Central Conumittee,
      and special Party commissions under gubernia committees, to
      combat various abuses and to inquire into complaints filed by
      Communists. </p>

      voice and vote, and 46 with voice only, represented over 332,000
      members of the Miners&#8217; Trade Union. Lenin and Kalinin were
      elected Honorary Chairmen. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      The Congress heard and discussed a report of the Minors&#8217;
      Trade Union Contral Committee and reports of the Mining Council
      and its chief administrations; discussed fuel supply,
      organisation of production and other problems. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      From January 22 to 24, the R.C.P.(B.) group had four meetings to
      discuss the trade unions&#8217; role and tasks. Lenin gave a
      report on January 23 and the absolute majority of the group
      voted for his platform. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      The Congress helped to mobilise the people to combat the fuel
      crisis and to work out production programmes for the mining
      industry. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      Lenin is quoting a speech by a Siberian delegate from
      Kollontai&#8217;s pamphlet, <a

      Workers Oppostion</em></a> (Moscow, 1921). The text quoted by
      Kollontai is not in the report of the Siberian delegate as it is

      <a id="fw16" href="#bk16" name="fw16">[16]</a> The reference is

      <a id="fw17" href="#bk17" name="fw17">[17]</a> The reference is
      to the Kharkov non-Party City Conference on March 5-6, 1921, on
      the food problem. It was attended by about 2,000 delegates. Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks sharply criticised the
      activity of economic and food supply bodies, but the Conference
      did not support their resolution. On the report of the Chairman
      of the Kharkov Gubernia Executive Committee it adopted a
      resolution mapping out concrete measures to improve the
      workers&#8217; food supplies. </p>

    <p class="endnote">

    <p class="endnote">
      <a id="fw19" href="#bk19" name="fw19">[19]</a> The Conference
      was held in Moscow from November 2 to 6, 1920, and was attended
      by 202 delegates with voice and vote, and 59, with voice
      only. The tasks of peaceful socialist construction demanded a
      reorganisation of trade union activity on the basis of greater
      democratisation, and this was opposed by Trotsky. At the
      Communist group meeting on November 3, he demanded the immediate
      &#8220;governmentalisation&#8221; of the trade unions, and the
      introduction of military methods of command and
      administration. His speech started the Party discussion on the
      trade unions, but his demands were rejected by the Communist
      delegates. </p>

    <p class="endnote">
      Y. E. Rudzutak gave a report on the trade unions&#8217; tasks in
      industry. The Conference adopted his theses, which were based on
      Lenin&#8217;s ideas that it was necessary to enhance the role of
      the trade unions in industry, develop democratic principles in
      their work, and strengthen the Party&#8217;s leadership in the
      trade union movement. These ideas were later developed in the
      resolution &#8220;The Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions&#8221;,
      adopted by the Tenth Party Congress. See <em>K.P.S.S. v
