    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw01" href="#bk01" name="fw01">[1]</a> <em> The
	Tenth Party Congress</em> was held in Moscow on March 8-16, 1921. It was
      attended by 694 delegates with voice and vote and 296 with voice only.
      They represented 732,521 Party members. The items on the agenda were:  1)
      Report of the Central Committee 2) Report of the Control Commission; 3)
      The trade unions&#8217; economic role; 4) The Socialist Republic in a
      capitalist encirclement foreign trade, concessions, etc.; 5) Food supply,
      surplus-food appropriation, tax in kind and fuel crisis, 6) Problems of
      Party organisation; 7) The Party&#8217;s current tasks in the
      nationalities question; 8) Reorganisation of the army and the militia
      question; 9) The Chief Administration for Political Education and the
      Party&#8217;s propaganda and agitation work; 10) Report of the
      R.C.P.&#8217;s representative in the Comintern, and its current tasks; 11)
      Report of the R.C.P.&#8217;s representatives in the International Trade
      Union Council; 12) Elections to the Central Committee, the Control
      Commission and the Auditing Commission. The Congress resolutions dealt
      with the key political and economic problems. </p>
    
    <p class="endnote"> Lenin lead much of the work of the Congress: he
      delivered the opening and closing speeches and gave reports on the
      political activity of the C.C., the substitution of a tax in kind for the
      surplus appropriation system, the Party&#8217;s unity and the
      anarcho-syndicalist deviation, the trade unions and the fuel crisis. He
      drafted the main resolutions. He gave a theoretical and political
      substantiation of the necessity of transition from War Communism to the
      New Economic Policy (NEP). The Congress adopted historic decisions on the
      substitution of a tax in kind for the surplus appropriation system, and
      the transition to NEP, which was designed to draw millions of peasants
      into the organization of the planned socialist economy. </p>
	
    <p class="endnote"> The Congress paid special attention to the
      Party&#8217;s unity. Lenin exposed and sharply criticised the anti-Marxist
      views of the opposition groups. The resolution &#8220;On Party
      Unity&#8221; adopted on Lenin&#8217;s motion ordered the immediate
      dissolution of all factions and groups which tended to weaken the
      Party&#8217;s unity. The Congress authorised the Central Committee to
      apply, as an extreme measure, expulsion from the Party to C.C. members who
      engaged in factional activity. </p>
	
    <p class="endnote"> The Congress also adopted Lenin&#8217;s draft
      resolution &#8220;On the Syndicalist and Anarchist Deviation in our
      Party&#8221;, which exposed the views of the Workers&#8217; Opposition as
      an expression of petty-bourgeois, anarchist vacillations. The propaganda
      of anarcho-syndicalist ideas was found to be incompatible with membership
      in the Party. With the country engaged in peaceful socialist construction,
      the Congress came down in favour of broader democracy within the Party.
    </p>
	
    <p class="endnote"> The Congress summed up the discussion on the trade
      unions&#8217; role in economic development, condemned the ideas of the ,
      the Workers&#8217; Opposition, the Democratic Centralism group and other 
      trends, and approved Lenin&#8217;s platform by an overwhelming majority,
      terming the trade unions as a school of communism, and suggesting measures
      to develop trade union democracy. </p>
	
    <p class="endnote"> A commission headed by Lenin worked out the
      Congress&#8217;s decisions on the Party&#8217;s nationalities policy in
      the new conditions: to eliminate the actual inequality of peoples which
      had been oppressed in tsarist Russia, and draw them into socialist
      construction. The Congress condemned the anti-Party deviations on the
      nationalities question, great-power chauvinism and local nationalism,
      which were a grave danger to communism and proletarian internationalism.
    </p>
	
    <p class="endnote"> On the newly elected 25-man Central Committee were
      Lenin, Artyom (F. A. Sergeyev), F. E. Dzerzhinsky, Leon Trotsky, L.
      Kamanev, G. Zinoviev, M. I. Kalinin, G. K. Orjonikidze, M. V. Frunze, Y.
      E. Rudzutak, J. V. Stalin, Y. M. Yaroslavsky; S. M. Kirov, V. V.
      Kuibysllev, V. Y. Chubar were among the alternate members. </p>
    
    <p class="endnote"> The historic decisions of the Tenth Congress charted
      the ways of transition from capitalism to socialism, and methods of
      construction of socialism in the new conditions; they stressed the
      importance of greater unity between the proletariat and the peasantry, and
      stronger Party leadership in the construction of Soviet Russia. </p>
