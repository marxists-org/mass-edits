    Closing The Congress</h3> <h4>March 23</h4> <p>Comrades, all the
    items on our agenda have been dealt with. Permit me to say a few
    words in closing the Congress.</p> 

    <p>Comrades, it is not only the loss of one of our best organisers
    and practical leaders, Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov, that has made
    the time at which we assembled here a very difficult one. It is a
    particularly difficult time because international imperialism is
    making a last and exceptionally strenuous effort to crush the
    Soviet Republic&#8212;of this there is now no doubt. We do not
    doubt that the fierce attacks launched in the West and the East,
    accompanied as they are by a number of whiteguard revolts and
    attempts to dismantle the railway line in several places, are
    deliberate measures apparently decided on in Paris by the Entente
    imperialists. We all know, comrades, how difficult it was for
    Russia, after four years of imperialist war, to take up arms in
    defence of the Soviet Republic against the imperialist
    plunderers. We all know what a burden this war is, how it is
    exhausting us. But we also know that this war is being fought with
    redoubled vigour and dauntless courage only because for the first
    time in world history, an army, an armed force, has been created,
    which knows what it is fighting for; and because, for the first
    time in world history, workers and peasants are making incredible
    sacrifices in the knowledge that they are defending the Soviet
    Socialist Republic, the rule of the working people over the
    capitalists; they know that they are defending the cause of the
    world proletarian socialist revolution.</p> 

    <p>Amidst these difficult conditions we accomplished a great deal
    in a very short time. We managed to endorse our programme
    unanimously, as was the case with every vital decision of the
    Congress. We are convinced that in spite of its numerous literary
    and other shortcomings, this programme has already gone into the
    history of the Third International as the programme which sums up
    the results of the new stage in the world movement for the
    emancipation of the proletariat. We are convinced that in many
    countries, where we have far more allies and friends than we
    imagine, the mere translation of our programme will provide the
    most effective answer to the question as to what has been done by
    the Russian Communist Party, which is one of the units of the
    international proletariat. Our programme will serve as extremely
    effective material for propaganda and agitation; it is a document
    which will lead the workers to say, &#8220;Here are our comrades,
    our brothers; here our common cause is becoming
    reality.&#8221;</p> 

    <p>Comrades, we succeeded in passing a number of other important
    decisions at this Congress. We approved of the formation of the
    Third, Communist International, which was founded here in
    Moscow. We adopted a unanimous decision on the military
    question. Vast though the differences of opinion may have appeared
    at first, diverse as may have been the views of the many comrades
    who very frankly criticised the shortcomings of our military
    policy, we on the commission found no difficulty in arriving at an
    absolutely unanimous decision, and we shall leave this Congress
    convinced that our chief defender, the Red Army, for the sake of
    which the whole country is making such incalculable sacrifices,
    will find in every delegate to the Congress, in every member of
    the Party, a warm, unselfish and devoted assistant, leader,
      friend and collaborator.</p>
    
    <p>Comrades, we were able to solve the organisational problems
    confronting us with such ease because the solutions had been
    indicated by the entire history of the relations between the Party
    and the Soviets. All we were called upon to do was sum up. On the
    subject of our work in the rural districts; the Congress, in a
    unanimous decision speedily arrived at, laid down our policy on a
    question that is particularly important and particularly
    difficult, and one that in other countries is even regarded as
    insoluble&#8212;the attitude of the proletariat which has
    overthrown the bourgeoisie towards the vast masses of middle
    peasants. We are all convinced that this Congress decision will
    help to consolidate our power. We are convinced that in the trying
    period through which we are now passing, when the imperialists are
    making their final effort to overthrow the Soviet government by
    force, and when an acute food shortage and the chaotic state of
    the transport have once again rendered the position of hundreds,
    thousands and millions of people desperate, the resolution we
    adopted and the spirit which animated the delegates to this
    Congress will help us to bear these trials and to
      live through this difficult half-year.</p>
    
    <p>We are convinced that <em>this will be the last difficult
    half-year.</em> This conviction of ours is greatly strengthened by
    the news we announced to the Congress the other day&#8212;the news
    of the success of the proletarian revolution in Hungary. Up to now
    Soviet power has been victorious in only one country, among the
    peoples which once constituted the former Russian Empire; and
    short-sighted people, who found it exceptionally difficult to
    abandon routine and old habits of thought (even though they may
    have belonged to the socialist camp), imagined that this
    surprising swing towards proletarian Soviet democracy was due
    entirely to the peculiar conditions prevailing in Russia; they
    thought that perhaps the specific features of this democracy
    reflected, as in a distorting mirror, the peculiar features of
    former, tsarist Russia. If there was ever any foundation for such
    an opinion, there is certainly none whatever now. Comrades, the
    news received today gives us a picture of the Hungarian
    Revolution. We learn from today&#8217;s news that the Allied
    powers have presented a brutal ultimatum to Hungary demanding free
    passage for their troops. The bourgeois government, seeing that
    the Allied powers wanted to move their troops through Hungary,
    seeing that Hungary would be subjected to the frightful sufferings
    of a new war&#8212;this government of bourgeois compromisers
    voluntarily resigned, voluntarily opened negotiations with the
    Communists, our Hungarian comrades, who were in prison, and
    voluntarily admitted that there was no way out of the situation
    except by transferring power to the
      working people. <em>(Applause.</em>)</p>

    <p>It was said that we were usurpers. At the end of 1917 and the
    beginning of 1918, the only words with which the bourgeoisie and
    many of their followers described our revolution were
    &#8220;violence&#8221; and &#8220;usurpation&#8221;. Even now we
    hear statements to the effect that the Bolshevik government is
    holding on by force, although we have repeatedly demonstrated that
    this is absurd. But if such absurdities could be uttered in the
    past, they have now been silenced by what has occurred in
    Hungary. Even the bourgeoisie has realised that there can be no
    government authority except that of the Soviets. The bourgeoisie
    of a more cultured country sees more clearly than our bourgeoisie
    did on the eve of October 25 that the country is perishing, that
    trials of increasing severity are being imposed on the people, and
    that, therefore, political power must be transferred to the
    Soviets, that the workers and peasants of Hungary, the new,
    Soviet, proletarian democracy must save her.</p>

    <p>Comrades, the difficulties which face the Hungarian revolution
    are immense. Hungary is a small country compared with Russia and
    can be stifled by the imperialists much more easily. However great
    the difficulties which undoubtedly still face Hungary, we have
    achieved a moral victory in addition to a victory for Soviet
    power. A most radical, democratic and compromising bourgeoisie
    realised that at a moment of extreme crisis, when a new war is
    menacing a country already exhausted by war, a Soviet government
    is a historical necessity, that in such a country there can be no
    government but a Soviet government, the dictatorship of the
    proletariat.</p>

    <p>Comrades, behind us there is a long line of revolutionaries who
    sacrificed their lives for the emancipation of Russia. The lot of
    the majority of these revolutionaries was a hard one. They
    suffered the persecution of the tsarist government, but it was not
    their good fortune to see the triumph of the revolution. A better
    fortune has fallen to our lot. Not only have we seen the triumph
    of our revolution, not only have we seen it become consolidated
    amidst unprecedented difficulties, create new forms of government
    and win the sympathy of the whole world, but we are also seeing
    the seed sown by the Russian revolution springing up in
    Europe. This imbues us with the absolute and unshakable conviction
    that no matter how difficult the trials that may still befall us,
    and no matter how great the misfortunes that may be brought upon
    us by that dying beast, international imperialism, that beast will
    perish, and socialism will triumph throughout the
    world. <em>(Prolonged applause.</em>)</p>

    <p>I declare the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party closed.</p>
