    <h4>4</h4> <h3>Speech Closing The Debate On The Party
    Programme</h3> <h4>March 19</h4> <p><em>(Applause.</em>) Comrades,
    I could not divide this part of the question with Comrade
    Bukharin, after preliminary consultation, in such detail as was
    the case with the report. Perhaps it will prove unnecessary. I
    think the debate that unfolded here revealed primarily one
    thing&#8212;the absence of any definite and formulated
    counter-proposal. Many speakers dealt with separate points in a
    desultory way, but made no counter-proposals. I shall deal with
    the chief objections, which were mainly directed against the
    preamble. Comrade Bukharin told me that he is one of those who
    believe that it is possible in the preamble to combine a
    description of capitalism with a description of imperialism in
    such a way as to form an integral whole, but since this has not
    been done, we shall have to accept the existing draft.</p> 

    <p>Many of the speakers argued&#8212;and it was particularly
    emphasised by Comrade Podbelsky&#8212;that the draft presented to
    you is wrong. The arguments Comrade Podbelsky advanced were very
    strange indeed. For instance, he said that in Clause 1 the
    revolution is referred to as the revolution of such-and-such a
    date, and for some reason this suggested to Comrade Podbelsky the
    idea that even this revolution is numbered. I may say that in the
    Council of People&#8217;s Commissars we have to deal with numerous
    documents with index numbers, and often we get a little tired of
    them. But why convey this impression here? What has an index
    number to do with the question? We fix the day of the holiday and
    celebrate it. Can it be denied that it was precisely on October 25
    that we captured power? If you were to attempt to change this in
    any way, it would be artificial. If you call the revolution the
    October-November Revolution, you provide a pretext for saying that
    it was not accomplished in one day. Of course, it was accomplished
    in a longer period&#8212;not in October, not in November, and not
    even in one year. Comrade Podbelsky took exception to the fact
    that one of the clauses speaks of the <em>impending</em> social
    revolution. On these grounds he made it appear that the programme
    was guilty of the crime of &#8220;offending Her Majesty the social
    revolution&#8221;. Here we are in the middle of the social
    revolution and yet the programme says that it is impending! This
    argument is obviously groundless, because the revolution referred
    to in our programme is the world social revolution.</p> 

    <p>We are told that we approach the revolution from the economic
    point of view. Should we do so or not? Many over-enthusiastic
    comrades here went as far as to talk about a world Economic
    Council, and about subordinating all the national parties to the
    Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party. Comrade Pyatakov
    almost went as far as to say the same. <em>(Pyatakov</em>,
    <em>from his place</em>: &#8220;Do you think that would be a bad
    thing?&#8221;) Since he now says that it would not be a bad thing,
    I must reply that if there were anything like this in the
    programme, there would be no need to criticise it: the authors of
    such a proposal would have dug their own graves. These
    over-enthusiastic comrades have overlooked the fact that in the
    programme we must take our stand on what actually exists. One of
    these comrades&#8212;I think it was Sunitsa, who criticised the
    programme very vigorously and said it was worthless, and so
    forth&#8212;one of these over-enthusiastic comrades said that he
    did not agree that it must contain what actually exists, and
    proposed that it should contain what does not
    exist. <em>(Laughter.</em>) I think that this argument is so
    obviously false that the laughter it evokes is quite natural. I
    did not say that it must contain only what actually exists. I said
    that we must <em>proceed from what has been definitely
    established.</em> We must say and prove to the proletarians and
    working peasants that the communist revolution is inevitable. Did
    anybody here suggest that it is not necessary to say this? Had
    anybody made such a suggestion, it would have been proved to him
    that he was wrong. Nobody made any such suggestion, nor will
    anybody do so, because it is an undoubted fact that our Party came
    to power with the aid not only of the communist proletariat, but
    also of all the peasants. Shall we confine ourselves to telling
    these people who are now marching with us: &#8220;The
    Party&#8217;s only function is to carry on socialist
    construction. The communist revolution has been accomplished, put
    communism into effect.&#8221; Such an opinion would be utterly
    groundless, it would be wrong from the theoretical point of
    view. Our Party has absorbed directly, and still more indirectly,
    millions of people who are now beginning to understand the class
    struggle, to understand the transition from capitalism to
    communism.</p> 

    <p>It may now be said, and it would be no exaggeration at all to
    do so, of course, that nowhere, in no other country, have the
    working people displayed such keen interest in the question of
    transforming capitalism into socialism as the working people in
    our country today. Our people are giving more thought to this than
    the people of any other country. Is the Party not to give a reply
    to this question? We must demonstrate scientifically how this
    communist revolution will progress. All the other proposals fall
    short in this respect. Nobody wanted to delete it entirely. There
    was some vague talk about it being possible to abbreviate it,
    about not quoting from the old programme because it is wrong. But
    if the old programme were wrong, how could it have served as the
    basis of our activities for so many years? Perhaps we shall have a
    common programme when the world Soviet Republic is set up; by that
    time we shall probably have drafted several more programmes. But
    it would be premature to draft one now, when only one Soviet
    Republic exists in what was formerly the Russian Empire. Even
    Finland, which is undoubtedly advancing towards a Soviet Republic,
    has not yet reached it. And yet the Finnish people are the most
    cultured of the peoples that inhabit what was formerly the Russian
    Empire. Consequently, it is utterly wrong to demand that the
    programme should now reflect a finished process. It would be on a
    par with inserting the demand for a world Economic Council. We
    ourselves have not yet grown accustomed to this ugly word
    Sovnarkhoz&#8212;Economic Council; as for foreigners, it is said
    that some of them searched the railway directory, thinking that
    there was a station of that name. <em>(Laughter.</em>) We cannot
    dictate such words to the whole world by means of decrees.</p> 

    <p>To be international, our programme must take into account the
    class factors which are characteristic of the economy of all
    countries. It is characteristic of all countries that capitalism
    is still developing in a great many places. This is true of the
    whole of Asia, of all countries which are advancing towards
    bourgeois democracy; it is true of a number of parts of
    Russia. For instance, Comrade Rykov, who is closely familiar with
    the facts in the economic field, told us of the new bourgeoisie
    which have arisen in our country. This is true. The bourgeoisie
    are emerging not only from among our Soviet government
    employees&#8212;only a very few can emerge from their
    ranks&#8212;but from the ranks of the peasants and handicraftsmen
    who have been liberated from the yoke of the capitalist banks, and
    who are now cut off from railway communication. This is a
    fact. How do you think you will get round this fact? You are only
    fostering your own illusions, or introducing badly digested
    book-learning into reality, which is far more complex. It shows
    that even in Russia, capitalist commodity production is alive,
    operating, developing and giving rise to a bourgeoisie, in the
    same way as it does in every capitalist society.</p> 

    <p>Comrade Rykov said, &#8220;We are fighting against the
    bourgeoisie who are springing up in our country because the
    peasant economy has not yet disappeared; this economy gives rise
    to a bourgeoisie and to capitalism.&#8221; We do not have exact
    figures about it, but it is beyond doubt that this is the case. So
    far a Soviet Republic exists only within the boundaries of what
    was formerly the Russian Empire. It is maturing and developing in
    a number of countries, but it does not yet exist in any other
    country. It would, therefore, be fantastic to claim in our
    programme something we have not yet reached; it would merely
    express a desire to escape unpleasant reality, which shows that
    the birth-pangs of other countries bringing forth socialist
    republics are undoubtedly more severe than those we
    experienced. We found it easy because on October 27 ,1917, we gave
    legal effect to what the peasants had demanded in the resolutions
    of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. This is not the case in any
    other country. A Swiss comrade and a German comrade told us that
    in Switzerland the peasants took up arms against the strikers as
    never before, and that in Germany there is not the faintest
    indications in the rural districts of the likelihood of the
    appearance of councils of agricultural labourers and small
    peasants. In our country, however, Soviets of Peasants&#8217;
    Deputies were formed almost over the entire country in the first
    few months of the revolution. We, a backward country, created
    them. Here a gigantic problem arises, for which the people in the
    capitalist countries have not yet found a solution. Were we a
    model capitalist nation? Survivals of serfdom were still to be
    found in this country right up to 1917. But no nation organised on
    capitalist lines has yet shown how this problem can be solved in
    practice. We achieved power under exceptional conditions, when
    tsarist despotism stimulated a great burst of effort to bring
    about a radical and rapid change; and under these exceptional
    conditions we were able for several months to rely on the support
    of all the peasants. This is a historical fact. Right up to the
    summer of 1918, up to the time of the formation of the Poor
    Peasants&#8217; Committees, we were holding on as a government
    because we enjoyed the support of all the peasants. This is
    impossible in any capitalist country. And it is this fundamental
    economic fact that you forget when you talk about radically
    redrafting the whole programme. Without this your programme will
    have no scientific foundation.</p> 

    <p>We must take as our point of departure the universally
    recognised Marxist thesis that a programme must be built on a
    scientific foundation. It must explain to the people how the
    communist revolution arose, why it is inevitable, what its
    significance, nature, and power are, and what problems it must
    solve. Our programme must be a summary for agitational purposes, a
    summary such as all programmes were, such as, for instance, the
    Erfurt Programme<a id="bk18" href="#fw18" name="bk18"><sup
    class="enote">[18]</sup></a> was. Every clause of that programme
    contained material for agitators to use in hundreds of thousands
    of speeches and articles. Every clause of our programme is
    something that every working man and woman must know, assimilate
    and understand. If they do not know what capitalism is, if they do
    not understand that small peasant and handicraft economy
    constantly, inevitably and necessarily engenders this
    capitalism&#8212;if they do not understand this, then even if they
    were to declare themselves Communists a hundred times and flaunt
    the most radical communism, it would not be worth a brass
    farthing, because we value communism only when it is based on
    economic facts.</p> 

    <p>The socialist revolution will cause many changes even in some
    of the advanced countries. The capitalist mode of production still
    exists in all parts of the world, and in many places it still
    bears its less developed forms in spite of the fact that
    imperialism has mobilised and concentrated finance capital. There
    is not a country in the world, even the most developed, where
    capitalism is to be found exclusively in its most perfect
    form. There is nothing like it even in Germany. When we were
    collecting material for our particular assignments, the comrade in
    charge of the Central Statistical Board informed us that in
    Germany the peasants <em>concealed</em> from the Food Supply
    Departments 40 per cent of their surplus potatoes. Small peasant
    farms, which engage in free, petty trading, and petty
    profiteering, are still to be found in a capitalist country where
    capitalism has reached its full development. Such facts must not
    be forgotten. Of the 300,000 members of the Party who are
    represented here, are there many who fully understand this
    question? It would be ridiculous conceit to imagine that because
    we, whose good fortune it was to draft this programme, understand
    all this, the entire mass of Communists also understands it. They
    do not, and they need this ABC. They need it a hundred times more
    than we do, because people who have not grasped, who have not
    understood what communism is and what commodity production is, are
    far removed from communism. We come across these cases of small
    commodity economy every day, in every question of practical
    economic policy, food policy, agricultural policy, on matters
    concerning the Supreme Economic Council. And yet we are told that
    we ought not to speak about it in the programme! If we heeded this
    advice we would only show that we are incapable of solving this
    problem, and that the success of the revolution in our country is
    due to exceptional circumstances.</p> 

    <p>Comrades from Germany visit us to study the forms of the
    socialist system. And we must act in such a way as to prove to our
    comrades from abroad that we are strong, to enable them to see
    that in our revolution we are not in the least exceeding the
    bounds of reality, and to provide them with material that will be
    absolutely irrefutable. It would be absurd to set up our
    revolution as the ideal for all countries, to imagine that it has
    made a number of brilliant discoveries and has introduced a heap
    of socialist innovations. I have not heard anybody make this claim
    and I assert that we shall not hear anybody make it. We have
    acquired practical experience in taking the first steps towards
    destroying capitalism in a country where specific relations exist
    between the proletariat and the peasants. Nothing more. If we
    behave like the frog in the fable and become puffed up with
    conceit, we shall only make ourselves the laughing-stock of the
    world, we shall be mere braggarts.</p> 

    <p>We educated the party of the proletariat with the aid of the
    Marxist programme, and the tens of millions of working people in
    our country must be educated in the same way. We have assembled
    here as ideological leaders and we must say to the people:
    &#8220;We educated the proletariat, and in doing so we always took
    our stand first and foremost on an exact economic analysis.&#8221;
    This cannot be done by means of a manifesto. The manifesto of the
    Third International is an appeal, a proclamation, it calls
    attention to the tasks that confront us, it is an appeal to the
    people&#8217;s sentiments. Take the trouble to prove
    scientifically that you have an economic basis, and that you are
    not building on sand. If you cannot do that, do not undertake to
    draw up a programme. To do it, we must necessarily review what we
    have lived through in these fifteen years. Fifteen years ago we
    said that we were advancing towards the social revolution, and now
    we have arrived; does that fact weaken our position? On the
    contrary, it reinforces and strengthens it. It all amounts to
    this, that capitalism is developing into imperialism, and
    imperialism leads to the beginning of the socialist revolution. It
    is tedious and lengthy, and not a single capitalist country has
    yet gone through this process, but it is necessary to deal with
    this in the programme.</p> 

    <p>That is why the theoretical arguments that have been levelled
    against this hold no water. I have no doubt that if we were to set
    ten or twenty writers, who are well able to expound their ideas,
    to work for three or four hours a day, they would, in the course
    of a month, draw up a better and more integral programme. But to
    demand that this should be done in a day or two, as Comrade
    Podbelsky does, is ridiculous. We worked for more than a day or
    two, or even a couple of weeks. I repeat that if it were possible
    to select a commission of thirty persons and set them to work
    several hours a day for a month, and moreover, not allow them to
    be disturbed by telephone calls, there can be no doubt that they
    would produce a programme five times better than this one. But
    nobody here has disputed essentials. A programme which says
    nothing about the fundamentals of commodity economy and capitalism
    will not be a Marxist international programme. To be international
    it is not enough for it to proclaim a world Soviet republic, or
    the abolition of nations, as Comrade Pyatakov did when he said:
    &#8220;We don&#8217;t want any nations. What we want is the union
    of all proletarians.&#8221; This is splendid, of course, and
    eventually it will come about, but at an entirely different stage
    of communist development. Comrade Pyatakov said in a patronising
    tone: &#8220;You were backward in 1917, but you have made
    progress.&#8221; We made progress when we put into the programme
    something that began to conform to reality. When we said that
    nations advance from bourgeois democracy to proletarian
    government, we stated what was a fact, although in 1917 it was
    merely an expression of what you desired.</p> 

    <p>When we establish with the Spartacists that complete comradely
    confidence needed for united communism, the comradely confidence
    that is maturing day by day, and which, perhaps, will come into
    being in a few months&#8217; time, we shall record it in the
    programme. But to proclaim it when it does not yet exist, would
    mean dragging them into something for which their own experience
    has not yet prepared them. We say that the Soviet type has
    acquired international significance. Comrade Bukharin mentioned
    the Shop Stewards&#8217; Committees in Britain. These are not
    quite Soviets. They are developing but they are still in the
    embryonic stage. When they burst into full bloom, we shall
    &#8220;see what happens&#8221;. But the argument that we are
    presenting Russian Soviets to the British workers is beyond all
    criticism.</p> 

    <p>I must now deal with the question of self-determination of
    nations. Our criticism has served to exaggerate the importance of
    this question. The defect in our criticism was that it attached
    special significance to this question, which, in substance, is of
    less than secondary importance in the programme&#8217;s general
    structure, in the sum total of programme demands.</p> 

    <p>While Comrade Pyatakov was speaking I was amazed and asked
    myself what it was, a debate on the programme, or a dispute
    between two Organising Bureaus? When Comrade Pyatakov said that
    the Ukrainian Communists act in conformity with the instructions
    of the Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.), I was not sure about
    the tone in which he said it. Was it regret? I do not suspect
    Comrade Pyatakov of that, but what he said was tantamount to
    asking what was the good of all this self-determination when we
    have a splendid Central Committee in Moscow. This is a childish
    point of view. The Ukraine was separated from Russia by
    exceptional circumstances, and the national movement did not take
    deep root there. Whatever there was of such a movement the Germans
    killed. This is a fact, but an exceptional fact. Even as regards
    the language it is not clear whether the Ukrainian language today
    is the language of the common people or not. The mass of working
    people of the other nations greatly distrusted the Great Russians
    whom they regarded as a kulak and oppressor nation. That is a
    fact. A Finnish representative told me that among the Finnish
    bourgeoisie, who hated the Great Russians, voices are to be heard
    saying: &#8220;The Germans proved to be more savage brutes, the
    Entente proved to be more savage, we had better have the
    Bolsheviks.&#8221; This is the tremendous victory we have gained
    over the Finnish bourgeoisie in the national question. This does
    not in the least prevent us from fighting it as our class enemy
    and from choosing the proper methods for the purpose. The Soviet
    Republic, which has been established in the country where tsarism
    formerly oppressed Finland, must declare that it respects the
    right of nations to independence. We concluded a treaty with the
    short-lived Red Finnish Government and agreed to certain
    territorial concessions, to which I heard quite a number of
    utterly chauvinistic objections, such as: &#8220;There are
    excellent fisheries there, and you have surrendered them.&#8221;
    These are the kind of objections which induce me to say,
    &#8220;Scratch some Communists and you will find Great Russian
    chauvinists.&#8221;</p> 

    <p>I think that the case of Finland, as well as of the Bashkirs,
    shows that in dealing with the national question one cannot argue
    that economic unity should be effected under all circumstances. Of
    course, it is necessary! But we must endeavour to secure it by
    propaganda, by agitation, by a voluntary alliance. The Bashkirs
    distrust the Great Russians because the Great Russians are more
    cultured and have utilised their culture to rob the Bashkirs. That
    is why the term Great Russian is synonymous with the terms
    &#8220;oppressor&#8221;, &#8220;rogue&#8221; to Bashkirs in those
    remote places. This must be taken into account, it must be
    combated, but it will be a lengthy process. It cannot be
    eliminated by a decree. We must be very cautious in this
    matter. Exceptional caution must be displayed by a nation like the
    Great Russians, who earned the bitter hatred of all the other
    nations; we have only just learned how to remedy the situation,
    and then, not entirely. For instance, at the Commissariat of
    Education, or connected with it, there are Communists, who say
    that our schools are uniform schools, and therefore don&#8217;t
    dare to teach in any language but Russian. In my opinion, such a
    Communist is a Great-Russian chauvinist. Many of us harbour such
    sentiments and they must be combated.</p> 

    <p>That is why we must tell the other nations that we are
    out-and-out internationalists and are striving for the voluntary
    alliance of the workers and peasants of all nations. This does not
    preclude wars in the least. War is another question, and-arises
    out of the very nature of imperialism. If we are fighting Wilson,
    and Wilson uses a small nation as his tool, we say that we shall
    oppose that tool. We have never said anything different. We have
    never said that a socialist republic can exist without military
    forces. War may be necessary under certain circumstances. But at
    present, the essence of the question of the self-determination of
    nations is that different nations are advancing in the same
    historical direction, but by very different zigzags and by-paths,
    and that the more cultured nations are obviously proceeding in a
    way that differs from that of the less cultured nations. Finland
    advanced in a different way. Germany is advancing in a different
    way. Comrade Pyatakov is a thousand times right when he says that
    we need unity. But we must strive for it by means of propaganda,
    by Party influence, by forming united trade unions. But here, too,
    we must not act in a stereotyped way. If we do away with this
    point, or formulate it differently, we shall be deleting the
    national question from the programme. This might be done if there
    were people with no specific national features. But there are no
    such people, and we cannot build socialist society in any other
    way.</p> 

    <p>I think, comrades, that the programme proposed here should be
    accepted as a basis and then referred back to the commission,
    which should be enlarged by the inclusion of representatives of
    the opposition, or rather, of comrades who have made practical
    proposals, and that the commission should put forward (1) the
    amendments to the draft that have been enumerated, and (2) the
    theoretical objections on which no agreement can be reached. I
    think this will be the most practical way of dealing with the
    matter, and one that will most speedily lead to a correct
    decision. <em>(Applause.</em>)</p>
