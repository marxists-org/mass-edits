    <h3>Report Of The Central Committee</h3>

    <h4>March 18</h4>

    <p class="fst">
      <em>(Stormy prolonged applause. Cries of &#8220;Long live
      Ilyich!&#8221; &#8220;Long live Comrade Lenin!&#8221;)</em></p> 

    <p>Comrades, permit me to begin with the political report of the
      Central Committee. To present a report on the Central
      Committee&#8217;s political activities since the last Congress is
      tantamount to presenting a report on the whole of our revolution;
      and I think that everybody will agree that not only is it
      impossible for one individual to perform such a task in so short a
      time, but that it is, in general, beyond the powers of one
      individual. I have therefore decided to confine myself to those
      points which, in my opinion, are particularly important in the
      history of what our Party was called upon to do during this period
      and in the light of our present tasks. I must say that at a time
      like this I find it beyond my powers to devote myself exclusively
      to history, to reviewing the past without bearing in mind the
      present and the future.</p> 
   
    <p>To begin with foreign policy, it goes without saying that the
    outstanding features here were our relations with German
    imperialism and the Brest peace. I think it is worth while
    dwelling on this question, because its importance is not merely
    historical. I think that the proposal the Soviet government made
    to the Allied powers, or, to put it more correctly, our
    government&#8217;s consent to the well-known proposal for a
    conference to be held on Princes Islands<a id="bk02" href="#fw02"
    name="bk02"><sup class="enote">[2]</sup></a> I think that this
    proposal, and our reply, reflect, in some respects, and in
    important respects at that, the relations with imperialism that we
    established at the time of the Brest peace. That is why I think it
    important to deal with the history of this matter in view of the
    rapidity with which events are occurring.</p> 

    <p>When the Brest peace was decided on, the Soviet system and even
    Party development were still in the initial stages. You know that
    at that time our Party as a whole still possessed too little
    experience to determine, even approximately, how fast we should
    travel the path we had chosen. The chaotic conditions that, as you
    know, we had to take over from the past made it extremely
    difficult at that time to survey events and obtain an exact
    picture of what was going on. Moreover, our extreme isolation from
    Western Europe and all other countries deprived us of the
    objective material necessary to assess the possible rapidity or
    the ways in which the proletarian revolution in the West would
    develop. This complex situation made the question of the Brest
    peace a matter of no little dissension in the ranks of our
    Party.</p> 

    <p>But events have proved that this enforced retreat before German
    imperialism, which had taken cover behind an extremely oppressive,
    outrageous and predatory peace, was the only correct move in the
    relations between the young socialist republic and world
    imperialism (one half of world imperialism). At that time we, who
    had just overthrown the landowners and the bourgeoisie in Russia,
    had absolutely no choice but to retreat before the forces of world
    imperialism. Those who condemned this retreat from the point of
    view of a revolutionary were actually supporting a fundamentally
    wrong and non-Marxist position. They had forgotten the conditions,
    the long and strenuous process of development of the Kerensky
    period, and the enormous preparatory work done in the Soviets
    before we reached the stage when, in October, after the severe
    July defeats, after the Kornilov revolt, the vast mass of working
    people was at last ready and determined to overthrow the
    bourgeoisie, and when the organised material forces necessary for
    this purpose had become available. Naturally, anything like this
    was then out of the question on an international scale. In view of
    this, the fight against world imperialism had this aim&#8212;to
    continue the work of disintegrating imperialism and of
    enlightening and uniting the working class, which had everywhere
    begun to stir, but whose actions have still not become completely
    definite.</p> 

    <p>Hence, the only correct policy was the one we adopted in
    respect of the Brest peace, although, of course, at the time, that
    policy intensified the enmity of a number of petty-bourgeois
    elements, who are not by any means necessarily hostile to
    socialism under all conditions, or in all countries. In this
    respect history offered us a lesson which we must learn
    thoroughly, for there can be no doubt that we shall often be
    called upon to apply it. This lesson is that the attitude the
    party of the proletariat should adopt towards the petty-bourgeois
    democratic parties, towards those elements, strata, groups and
    classes which are particularly strong and numerous in Russia, and
    which exist in all countries, constitutes an extremely complex and
    difficult problem. Petty-bourgeois elements vacillate between the
    old society and the new. They cannot be the motive force of either
    the old society, or the new. On the other hand, they are not bound
    to the old society to the same degree as the landowners and the
    bourgeoisie. Patriotism is a sentiment bound up with the economic
    conditions of life of precisely the small proprietors. The
    bourgeoisie is more international than the small proprietors. We
    came up against this fact during the period of the Brest peace,
    when the Soviet government set a higher value on the world
    dictatorship of the proletariat and the world revolution than on
    all national sacrifices, burdensome as they were. This compelled
    us to enter into a violent and ruthless clash with the
    petty-bourgeois elements. At that time a number of those elements
    joined forces with the bourgeoisie and the landowners against us,
    although, subsequently, they began to waver.</p> 

    <p>The question that several comrades have raised here as to our
      attitude towards the petty-bourgeois parties is dealt with
      extensively in our programme and will, in fact, crop up in the
      discussion of every point of the agenda. In the course of our
      revolution this question has ceased to be an abstract and
      general one, and has become concrete. At the time of the Brest
      peace our duty as internationalists was at all costs to help the
      proletarian elements to strengthen and consolidate their
      positions and this drove the petty- bourgeois parties away from
      us. After the German revolution, as we know, the petty-bourgeois
      elements again began to vacillate. Those events opened the eyes
      of many who, as the proletarian revolution was maturing, had
      assessed the situation from the point of view of the old type of
      patriotism, and had assessed it not only in a non-socialist way,
      but, in general, incorrectly. At the present time, owing to the
      difficult food situation and the war which we are still waging
      against the Entente, a wave of vacillation is again sweeping
      through the petty-bourgeois democrats. We have been obliged to
      reckon with these vacillations before; but now we must all learn
      a tremendously important lesson, namely, that situations never
      repeat themselves in exactly the same form. The new situation is
      far more complex. It can be properly assessed, and our policy
      will be correct, if we draw on the experience of the Brest
      peace. When we consented to the proposal for a conference on
      Princes Islands we knew that we were consenting to an extremely
      harsh peace. On the other hand, however, we now know better how
      the tide of proletarian revolution is rising in Western Europe,
      how unrest is changing into conscious discontent, and how the
      latter is giving rise to a world, Soviet, proletarian
      movement. At that time we were groping, guessing when the
      revolution in Europe might break out&#8212;we presumed, on the
      basis of our theoretical conviction, that the revolution must
      take place&#8212;but today we have a number of facts showing how
      the revolution is maturing in other countries and how the
      movement began. That is why, in relation to Western Europe, in
      relation to the Entente countries, we have, or shall have, to
      repeat a good deal of what we did at the time of the Brest
      peace. It will be much easier for us to do this now that we have
      the experience of Brest. When our Central Committee discussed
      the question of participating in a conference on Princes Islands
      together with the Whites&#8212;which in fact amounted to the
      annexation of all the territory the Whites then
      occupied&#8212;this question of an armistice did not evoke a
      single voice of protest among the proletariat; and that also was
      the attitude of our Party. At any rate, I did not hear of any
      dissatisfaction, or indignation, from any quarter. The reason
      for this was that our lesson in international politics had borne
      fruit.

    </p>
    <p>
      Insofar as concerns the petty-bourgeois elements, the problem
      facing the Party has not yet been fully solved. On a number of
      questions, in fact on all the questions on the agenda, we have,
      during the past year, laid the foundation for a correct solution
      of this problem, particularly in relation to the middle
      peasants. In theory we agree that the middle peasants are not
      our enemies, that they need special treatment, and that in their
      case the situations will vary in accordance with numerous
      circumstances attending the revolution, in particular, the
      answer to the question &#8220;For or against patriotism?&#8221;
      For us such questions are of second rate importance, even of
      third-rate importance; but the petty bourgeoisie is completely
      blinded by them. Furthermore, all these elements waver in the
      struggle and become absolutely spineless. They do not know what
      they want, and are incapable of defending their position. Here
      we need extremely flexible and extremely cautious tactics, for
      sometimes it is necessary to give with one hand and take away
      with the other. The petty-bourgeois elements and not we are to
      blame for this, for they cannot make up their minds. We can see
      this in practice now. Only today we read in the newspapers what
      the German Independents,<a id="bk03" href="#fw03"
      name="bk03"><sup class="enote">[3]</sup></a> who possess such
      strong forces as Kautsky and Hilferding, have set out to
      attain. You know that they wanted to incorporate the
      workers&#8217; councils in the constitution of the German
      democratic republic, i.e., marry the Constituent Assembly to the
      dictatorship of the proletariat. From our point of view this is
      such a mockery of common sense in our revolution, the German
      Revolution, the Hungarian revolution and the maturing Polish
      revolution, that we can only express our amazement. It must be
      said that such vacillating elements are to be found in the most
      advanced countries. Educated, well-informed, intelligent people,
      even in such an advanced capitalist country as Germany, are
      sometimes a hundred times more muddle-headed and hysterical than
      our backward petty bourgeoisie. In this there is a lesson for
      Russia in respect of the petty-bourgeois parties and the middle
      peasants. For a long time we shall have a difficult, double
      problem. For a long time these parties are bound to take one
      step forward and two steps back because their economic status
      compels them to do so, and because their acceptance of socialism
      is not due to a definite conviction that the bourgeois system is
      worthless. We cannot expect them to be loyal to socialism, and
      it would be absurd to rely on their socialist convictions. They
      will support socialism only when they are convinced that there
      is no other way out, when the bourgeoisie is finally defeated
      and smashed.</p>

    <p>I am unable to give you a systematic summary of the experience
    of the past year and have glanced at the past only in the light of
    what is required for our policy tomorrow and the day after. The
    chief lesson is that we must be extremely cautious in our attitude
    towards the middle peasants and the petty bourgeoisie., The
    experience of the past demands it, we know it from the experience
    of Brest. We shall have to change our line of conduct very often,
    and this may appear strange and incomprehensible to the casual
    observer. &#8220;How is that?&#8221; he will say. &#8220;Yesterday
    you were making promises to the petty bourgeoisie, while today
    Dzerzhinsky announces that the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and
    the Mensheviks will be stood against the wall. What a
    contradiction!&#8221; Yes, it is a contradiction. But the conduct
    of the petty-bourgeois democrats themselves is contradictory: they
    do not know where to sit, and try to sit between two stools, jump
    from one to the other and fall now to the right and how to the
    left. We have changed our tactics towards them, and whenever they
    turn towards us we say &#8220;Welcome&#8221; to them. We have not
    the slightest intention of expropriating the middle peasants; we
    certainly do not want to use force against the petty-bourgeois
    democrats. We say to them, &#8220;You are not a serious enemy. Our
    enemy is the bourgeoisie. But if you join forces with them, we
    shall be obliged to apply the measures of the proletarian
    dictatorship to you, too.&#8221;</p> 

    <p>I shall now deal with questions of internal development,
    briefly touch on the main features which characterise our
    political experience and sum up the political activities of the
    Central Committee during this period. These political activities
    of the Central Committee manifested themselves daily in questions
    of immense importance. Were it not for the fact that we worked
    together so well and so harmoniously, as I have already told you,
    we would not have been able to act as we did, we would not have
    been able to solve these urgent problems. As to the question of
    the Red Army, which is now rousing so much discussion, and which
    stands as a special item on the agenda of this Congress, we
    adopted a host of minor, individual decisions which the Central
    Committee of our Party submitted to and got carried in the Council
    of People&#8217;s Commissars and the All-Russia Central Executive
    Committee. A still larger number of important individual
    assignments were made by the respective People&#8217;s Commissars,
    all of which systematically and consistently pursued one common
    line.</p> 

    <p>The organisation of a Red Army was an entirely new question
    which had never been dealt with before, even theoretically. Marx
    once said that it is to the credit of the Paris Communards that
    they carried into effect decisions which were not borrowed from
    some preconceived theories, but were dictated by actual
    necessity.<a id="bk04" href="#fw04" name="bk04"><sup
    class="enote">[4]</sup></a> Marx said this about the Communards in
    a somewhat ironical vein because there were two predominant trends
    in the Commune&#8212;the Blanquists and the Proudhonists&#8212;and
    both were compelled to act contrary to their doctrines. We,
    however, acted in conformity with the tenets of Marxism. At the
    same time, the political activities of the Central Committee in
    each concrete case were determined entirely by what was absolutely
    indispensable. We were often obliged to feel our way. This will be
    strongly emphasised by any historian capable of presenting an
    integrated picture of the activities of the Central Committee of
    the Party and of the Soviet government during the past year. This
    fact becomes all the more striking when we try to embrace our past
    experience in a single glance. But this did not deter us in the
    least even on October 10, 1917, when the question of seizing power
    was decided. We did not doubt that we should have to experiment,
    as Comrade Trotsky expressed it. We undertook a task which nobody
    in the world has ever attempted on so large a scale.</p> 

    <p>This is also true of the Red Army. When the war drew to a close
    the army began to break up, and many people thought at the time
    that this was a purely Russian phenomenon. But we see that the
    Russian revolution was in fact the dress rehearsal, or one of the
    rehearsals, for the world proletarian revolution. When we
    discussed the Treaty of Brest, when the question of peace arose
    early in January 1918, we did not yet know when, and in which
    other countries, armies would begin to disintegrate. We proceeded
    from experiment to experiment; we endeavoured to create a
    volunteer army, feeling our way, testing the ground and
    experimenting to find a solution to the problem in the given
    situation. And the nature of the problem was clear. Unless we
    defended the socialist republic by force of arms, we could not
    exist. A ruling class would never surrender its power to an
    oppressed class. And the latter would have to prove in practice
    that it is capable not only of overthrowing the exploiters, but
    also of organising its self-defence and of staking everything on
    it. We have always said that there are different kinds of wars. We
    condemned the <em>imperialist</em> war, but we did not reject
    <em>war in general.</em> Those who accused us of being militarists
    were hopelessly muddled. And when in the report of the Berne
    Conference of yellow socialists I read that Kautsky had said that
    the Bolsheviks had introduced not socialism but militarism, I
    smiled and shrugged my shoulders. As if there was ever a big
    revolution in history that was not connected with war! Of course
    not! We are living not merely in a state, but in a system of
    states, and it is inconceivable for the Soviet Republic to exist
    alongside of the imperialist states for any length of time. One or
    the other must triumph in the end. And before that end comes there
    will have to be a series of frightful collisions between the
    Soviet Republic and the bourgeois states. If the ruling class, the
    proletariat, wants to hold power, it must, there fore, prove its
    ability to do so by its military organisation. How was a class
    which had hitherto served as cannon-fodder for the military
    commanders of the ruling imperialist class to create its own
    commanders? How was it to solve the problem of combining the
    enthusiasm, the new revolutionary creative spirit of the oppressed
    and the employment of the store of the bourgeois science and
    technology of militarism in their worst forms without which this
    class would not be able to master modern technology and modern
    methods of warfare?</p> 

    <p>Here we were faced with a problem which a year&#8217;s
    experience has now summed up for us. When we included the question
    of bourgeois specialists in the revolutionary pro- gramme of our
    Party, we summed up the Party&#8217;s practical experience in one
    of the most important questions. As far as I remember the earlier
    teachers of socialism, who foresaw a great deal of what would take
    place in the future socialist revolution and discerned many of its
    features, never expressed an opinion on this question. It did not
    exist for them, for it arose only when we proceeded to create a
    Red Army. That meant creating an army filled with enthusiasm out
    of an oppressed class which had been used as mere cannon-fodder,
    and it meant compelling that army to utilise all that was most
    coercive and abhorrent in what we had inherited from
    capitalism.</p> 

    <p>This contradiction, with which we are faced in connection with
    the Red Army, faces us in every organisational field. Take the
    question which engaged our attention most of all, namely, the
    transition from workers&#8217; control to workers&#8217;
    management in industry. Following the decrees and decisions passed
    by the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars and local Soviet
    authorities&#8212;all of which contributed to our political
    experience in this field&#8212;actually the only thing left for
    the Central Committee to do was to sum up. In a matter like this
    it was scarcely able to give a lead in the true sense of the
    word. One has only to recall how clumsy, immature and casual were
    our first decrees and decisions on the subject of workers&#8217;
    control of industry. We thought that it was an easy matter;
    practice showed that it was necessary to build, but we gave no
    answer whatever to the question as to <em>how</em> to build. Every
    nationalised factory, every branch of nationalised industry,
    transport, and particularly railway transport&#8212;that most
    striking example of highly centralised capitalist machinery built
    on the basis of large-scale engineering, and most vital for the
    state&#8212;all embodied the concentrated experience of
    capitalism, and created immense difficulties for us.</p> 

    <p>We are still far from having overcome these difficulties. At
    first we regarded them in an entirely abstract way, like
    revolutionary preachers, who had absolutely no idea of how to set
    to work. There were lots of people, of course, who accused
    us&#8212;and all the socialists and Social-Democrats are accusing
    us today&#8212;of having undertaken this task without knowing how
    to finish it. But these accusations are ridiculous, made by people
    who lack the spark of life. As if one can set out to make a great
    revolution and know beforehand how it is to be completed! Such
    knowledge cannot be derived from books and our decision could
    spring only from the experience of the masses. And I say that it
    is to our credit that amidst incredible difficulties we undertook
    to solve a problem with which until then we were only half
    familiar, that we inspired the proletarian masses to display their
    own initiative, that we nationalised the industrial enterprises,
    and so forth. I remember that in Smolny we passed as many as ten
    or twelve decrees at one sitting. That was an expression of our
    determination and desire to stimulate the spirit of experiment and
    initiative among the proletarian masses. We now have
    experience. Now; we have passed, or are about to pass, from
    workers&#8217; control to workers&#8217; management of
    industry. Instead of being absolutely helpless as we were before,
    we are now armed with experience, and as far as this is possible,
    we have summed it up in our programme. We shall have to discuss
    this in detail when we deal with the question of organisation. We
    would not have been able to do this work had we not had the
    assistance and collaboration of the comrades from the trade
    unions.</p> 

    <p>In Western Europe the situation is different. There our
    comrades regard the trade unions as an evil, because they are
    commanded so completely by yellow representatives of the old type
    of socialism that the Communists do not see that much advantage is
    to be gained from their support. Many West-European Communists;
    even Rosa Luxemburg, are advocating the dissolution of the trade
    unions.<a id="bk05" href="#fw05" name="bk05"><sup
    class="enote">[5]</sup></a> That shows how much more difficult
    this problem is in Western Europe. In this country we could not
    have held out for a single month had it not been for the support
    of the trade unions. In this we have the experience of a vast
    amount of practical work, which enables us to set to work to solve
    extremely difficult problems.</p> 

    <p>Take the question of the specialists which faces us at every
    turn, which arises in connection with every appointment, and which
    the leaders of our economy, and the Central Committee of the
    Party, are continually having to face. Under existing conditions
    the Central Committee of the Party cannot perform its functions if
    it adheres to hard and fast forms. If we could not appoint
    comrades able to work independently in their particular fields, we
    should be unable to function at all. It was only thanks to the
    fact that we had organisers like Yakov Sverdlov that we were able
    to work under war conditions without a single conflict worth
    noting. And in this work we were obliged to accept the assistance
    offered us by people who possessed knowledge acquired in the
    past.</p> 

    <p>In particular, take the administration of the War
    Department. We could not have solved that problem had we not
    trusted the General Staff and the big specialists in
    organisation. There were differences of opinion among us on
    particular questions, but fundamentally, there was no room for
    doubt. We availed ourselves of the assistance of bourgeois experts
    who were thoroughly imbued with the bourgeois mentality, who were
    disloyal to us, and will remain disloyal to us for many years to
    come. Nevertheless, the idea that we can build communism with the
    aid of pure Communists, without the assistance of bourgeois
    experts, is childish. We have been steeled in the struggle, we
    have the forces, and we are united; and we must proceed with our
    organisational work, making use of the knowledge and experience of
    those experts. This is an indispensable condition, without which
    socialism cannot be built. Socialism cannot be built unless we
    utilise the heritage of capitalist culture. The only material we
    have to build communism with is what has been left us by
    capitalism.</p> 

    <p>We must now build in a practical way, and we have to build
    communist society with the aid of our enemies. This looks like a
    contradiction, an irreconcilable contradiction, perhaps. As a
    matter of fact, this is the only way the problem of building
    communism can be solved. And reviewing our experience, glancing at
    the way this problem confronts us every day, surveying the
    practical activities of the Central Committee, it seems to me
    that, in the main, our Party has found a solution to this
    problem. We have encountered immense difficulties, but this was
    the only way the problem could be solved. The bourgeois experts
    must be hemmed in by our organised, constructive and united
    activities so that they will be compelled to fall in line with the
    proletar- iat, no matter how much they resist and fight at every
    step. We must set them to work as a technical and cultural force
    so as to preserve them and to transform an uncultured and
    barbarian capitalist country into a cultured, communist
    country. And it seems to me that during the past year we have
    learned how to build, that we have taken the right road, and shall
    not now be diverted from this road.</p> 

    <p>I should also like to deal briefly with the food question and
    the question of the countryside. Food has always been our most
    difficult problem. In a country where the proletariat could only
    assume power with the aid of the peasantry, where the proletariat
    had to serve as the agent of a petty-bourgeois revolution, our
    revolution was largely a bourgeois revolution until the Poor
    Peasants&#8217; Committees were set up, i.e., until the summer and
    even the autumn of 1918. We are not afraid to admit that. We
    accomplished the October Revolution so easily because the peasants
    as a whole supported us and fought the landowners for they saw
    that as far as they were concerned we would go the limit, because
    we were giving legal effect to what the Socialist-Revolutionary
    newspapers had been printing, to that which the cowardly petty
    bourgeoisie had promised, but could not carry out. But from the
    moment the Poor Peasants&#8217; Committees began to be organised,
    our revolution became a <em>proletarian</em> revolution. We were
    faced with a problem which even now has not been fully solved, and
    it is extremely important that we have put it on a practical
    footing. The Poor Peasants&#8217; Committees were a transition
    stage. The first decree on their organisation was passed by the
    Soviet government on the recommendation of Comrade Tsyurupa, who
    at that time was in charge of food affairs. We have to save the
    non-agricultural population that was tormented by hunger. That
    could be done only with the aid of Poor Peasants&#8217;
    Committees, which were proletarian organisations. And only when
    the October Revolution began to spread to the rural districts and
    was consummated, in the summer of 1918, did we acquire a real
    proletarian base; only then did our revolution <em>become a
    proletarian revolution in fact</em>, and not merely in our
    proclamations, promises and declarations.</p> 

    <p>We have not yet solved the problem that faces our Party of
    creating the necessary forms of organisation of the rural
    proletariat and semi-proletariat. Recently I visited Petrograd and
    attended the First Congress of Farm Labourers of Petrograd
    Gubernia.<a id="bk06" href="#fw06" name="bk06"><sup
    class="enote">[6]</sup></a> I then saw how we were feeling our way
    in this matter, but I think that progress will undoubtedly be
    made. I must say that the principal lesson we learned from our
    work of political leadership in the past year was that we must
    find organisational support in this field. We took a step in this
    direction when we formed the Poor Peasants&#8217; Committees, held
    new elections to the Soviets and revised our food policy, where we
    had encountered immense difficulties. In those outlying parts of
    Russia which are now becoming Soviet&#8212;the Ukraine and the Don
    region&#8212;this policy may have to be modified. It would be a
    mistake to draw up stereotyped decrees for all parts of Russia; it
    would be a mistake for the Bolshevik Communists, the Soviet
    officials in the Ukraine and the Don, to apply these decrees to
    other regions wholesale, without discrimination. We shall meet
    with no few peculiar situations; we shall under no circumstances
    bind ourselves to uniform patterns; we shall not decide once and
    for all that our experience, the experience of Central Russia,
    must be applied in its entirety to every region. We have only just
    taken up the problems of real development; we are only just taking
    the first steps in this direction. An immense field of work is
    opening before us.</p> 

    <p>I said that the first decisive step the Soviet government took
    was to create the Poor Peasants&#8217; Committees. This measure
    was carried out by our food supply officials and was dictated by
    necessity. But in order to complete our tasks we must have
    something more than temporary organisations like these
    Committees. Alongside the Soviets we have the trade unions, which
    we are using as a school for training the backward masses. The top
    layer of workers who actually administered Russia during the past
    year, who bore the brunt of the work in carrying out our policy,
    and who were our mainstay&#8212;this layer in Russia is an
    extremely thin one. We have become convinced of that, we are
    feeling it. If a future historian ever collects information on the
    groups which administered Russia during these seventeen months, on
    how many hundreds, or how many thousands of individuals were
    engaged in this work and bore the entire, incredible burden of
    administering the country&#8212;nobody will believe that it was
    done by so few people. The number was so small because there were
    so few intelligent, educated and capable political leaders in
    Russia. This layer was a thin one in Russia, and in the course of
    the recent struggle it overtaxed its strength, became overworked,
    did more than its strength allowed. I think that at this Congress
    we shall devise practical means of utilising ever new forces on a
    mass scale in industry and&#8212;what is more important&#8212;in
    the rural districts, of enlisting in Soviet activities workers and
    peasants who are on, or even below, the average level. Without
    their assistance on a mass scale further activities, I think, will
    be impossible.</p> 

    <p>Since my time has almost expired, I want to say only a few
    words about our attitude towards the middle peasants. The attitude
    we should take towards the middle peasants was, in principle,
    quite clear to us even before the revolution. The task that faced
    us was to <em>neutralise</em> them. At a meeting in Moscow where
    the question of our attitude towards petty-bourgeois parties was
    discussed, I quoted the exact words of Engels, who not only
    pointed out that the middle peasants were our allies, but also
    expressed the view that it would be possible, perhaps, to dispense
    with coercion, with repressive measures even as regards the big
    peasants.<a id="bk07" href="#fw07" name="bk07"><sup
    class="enote">[7]</sup></a> In Russia, this assumption did not
    prove correct; we were, are, and will be, in a state of open civil
    war with the kulaks. This is inevitable. We have seen it in
    practice. But owing to the inexperience of our Soviet officials
    and to the difficulties of the problem, the blows which were
    intended for the kulaks very frequently fell on the middle
    peasants. In this respect we have sinned a great deal, but the
    experience we have gained will enable us to do every thing to
    avoid this in future. Such is the problem that now faces us not
    theoretically but practically. You are well aware that the problem
    is a difficult one. We have no advantages to offer the middle
    peasant; he is a materialist, a practical man, who demands
    definite material advantages, which at present we are not in a
    position to offer and which the country will have to dispense with
    for, perhaps, many months of a severe struggle that now promises
    to end in complete victory. But there is a good deal we can do in
    our practical administrative work&#8212;we can improve our
    administrative machinery and eliminate a host of abuses. The line
    of our Party, which has not done enough to form a bloc, an
    alliance, an agreement with the middle peasants, can and must be
    corrected.</p> 

    <p>This, in brief, is all I can say at present about the economic
    and political work of the Central Committee during the past
    year. I must now very briefly deal with the second part of the
    duty entrusted to me by the Central Committee&#8212;to make the
    Central Committee report on organisation. This duty could have
    been performed in the way it should really be performed only by
    Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov, who had been appointed to make the
    report on this question on behalf of the Central Committee. His
    unbelievably phenomenal memory, in which he retained the greater
    part of his report, and his personal acquaintance with the work of
    organisation in the various localities would have made it possible
    for him to deliver this report better than anybody else. I am
    unable to replace him even in one-hundredth part, for in this work
    we were obliged to rely, and were absolutely justified in relying,
    entirely on Comrade Sverdlov, who very often adopted decisions on
    his own responsibility.</p> 

    <p>I can give you short excerpts from the written reports now
    available. The Secretariat of the Central Committee, which was
    unable to complete its work in time, has most definitely promised
    that the written reports will be ready for printing next week,
    that they will be mimeographed and distributed to the Congress
    delegates. They will supplement the brief, fragmentary remarks
    which I can make here. In the material of the report available at
    present in writing, we find, first of all figures relating to the
    number of incoming documents: 1,483 in December 1918, 1,537 in
    January 1919 and 1,840 in February. The distribution of these
    documents in percentages is given, but I will take the liberty of
    not reading this. Comrades who are interested will see from the
    report when distributed that, for instance, 490 persons visited
    the Secretariat in November. And the comrades who handed me the
    report say it can be only half the number of visitors the
    Secretariat dealt with, because dozens of delegates were received
    daily by Comrade Sverdlov, and more than half of these were
    probably not Soviet but Party officials.</p> 

    <p>I must draw attention to the report on the activities of the
    Federation of Foreign Groups.<a id="bk08" href="#fw08"
    name="bk08"><sup class="enote">[8]</sup></a> I know something of
    the work in this field only insofar as I have been able to cast a
    glance at the material on the foreign groups. At first there were
    seven such groups, now there are nine. Comrades living in purely
    Great-Russian districts, who have not had the opportunity of
    becoming directly acquainted with these groups and who have not
    seen the reports in the newspapers, will please read the excerpts
    from the newspapers, which I shall take the liberty of not reading
    in full. I must say that here we see the real foundation of what
    we have done for the Third International. The Third International
    was founded in Moscow at a short congress, and Comrade Zinoviev
    will make a detailed report on this and on everything proposed by
    the Central Committee on all questions concerning the
    International. The fact that we succeeded in doing so much in so
    short a time at the congress of Communists in Moscow is due to the
    tremendous preparatory work that was performed by the Central
    Committee of our Party and by the organiser of the congress,
    Comrade Sverdlov. Propaganda and agitation were carried on among
    foreigners in Russia and a number of foreign groups were
    organised. Dozens of members of these groups were fully acquainted
    with the main plans and with the guiding lines of general
    policy. Hundreds of thousands of war prisoners from armies which
    the imperialists had created solely in their own interests, upon
    returning to Hungary, Germany and Austria, thoroughly infected
    those countries with the germs of Bolshevism. And the fact that
    groups and parties sympathising with us predominate in those
    countries is due to work which is not visible on the surface and
    which is only briefly summed up in the report on the
    organisational activities of the foreign groups in Russia; it
    constituted one of the most significant features in the activities
    of the Russian Communist Party as one of the units of the world
    communist party.</p> 

    <p>Further, the material handed to me contains data on the reports
    received by the Central Committee, and the organisations from
    which they were received. And here our Russian lack of
    organisational ability stands out in all its shameful
    wretchedness. Reports were received regularly from organisations
    in four gubernias, irregularly from fourteen, and isolated reports
    from sixteen. The gubernias in question are enumerated in the
    list, which permit me not to read. Of course, this lack of
    organisational ability, these extreme organisational drawbacks,
    are very largely, but not entirely, to be explained by the
    conditions of civil war. Least of all should we use this to hide
    behind, to excuse and defend ourselves. Organisational activity
    was never a strong point with the Russians in general, nor with
    the Bolsheviks in particular; nevertheless the chief problem of
    the proletarian revolution is <em>that of organisation.</em> It is
    not without reason that the question of organisation is here
    assigned a most prominent place. This is a thing we must fight
    for, and fight for with firmness and determination, using every
    means at our disposal. We can do nothing here except by prolonged
    education and re-education. This is a field in which revolutionary
    violence and dictatorship can be applied only by way of abuse and
    I make bold to warn you against such abuse. Revolutionary violence
    and dictatorship are excellent things when applied in the right
    way and against the right people. But they cannot be applied in
    the field of organisation. We have by no means solved this problem
    of education, re-education and prolonged organisational work, and
    we must tackle it systematically.</p> 

    <p>We have here a detailed financial report. Of the various items,
    the largest is in connection with workers&#8217; book publishing
    and with newspapers: 1,000,000, again 1,000,000 and again
    1,000,000&#8212;3,000,000; Party organisations, 2,800,000;
    editorial expenses, 3,600,000. More detailed figures are given in
    this report, which will be duplicated and distributed to all the
    delegates. Meanwhile the comrades can get their information from
    the representatives of the groups. Permit me not to read these
    figures. The comrades who submitted the reports gave in them what
    is most important and illustrative&#8212;the general results of
    the propaganda work performed in the sphere of publication. The
    Kommunist Publishing House released sixty-two books. A net profit
    of 2,000,000 in 1918 was earned by the newspaper <em>Pravda</em>,
    25,000,000 copies of which were issued during the year. The
    newspaper <em>Bednota</em><a id="bk09" href="#fw09"
    name="bk09"><sup class="enote">[9]</sup></a> earned a net profit
    of 2,370,000 and 33,000,000 copies were issued. The comrades of
    the Organising Bureau of the Central Committee have promised to
    rearrange the detailed figures they possess in such a way as to
    give at least two comparable criteria. It will then be clear what
    vast educational work is being performed by the Party, which for
    the first time in history is using modern large-scale capitalist
    printing equipment in the interests of the workers and peasants
    and not in the interests of the bourgeoisie. We have been accused
    thousands and millions of times of having violated the freedom of
    the press and of having renounced democracy. Our accusers call it
    democracy when the capitalists can buy out the press and the rich
    can use the press in their own interests. We call that plutocracy
    and not democracy. Everything that bourgeois culture has created
    for the purpose of deceiving the people and defending the
    capitalists we have taken from them in order to satisfy the
    political needs of the workers and peasants. And in this respect
    we have done more than any socialist party has done in a quarter
    of a century, or in half a century. Nevertheless, we have done far
    too little of what has to be done.</p> 

    <p>The last item in the material handed to me by the Bureau
    concerns circular letters. Fourteen of these were issued, and the
    comrades who are not acquainted with them, or who are not
    sufficiently acquainted with them, are invited to read them. Of
    course, the Central Committee was far from being as active as it
    should have been in this respect, but you must bear in mind the
    conditions under which we worked, when we were obliged to give
    political instructions on a number of questions every day, and
    only in exceptional, even rare, cases were we able to do so
    through the Political Bureau or the plenary meeting of the Central
    Committee. Under such circumstances it was impossible for us to
    send out frequent political circulars.</p> 

    <p>I repeat that we, as the militant organ of a militant party in
    time of civil war, cannot work in any other way. If we did, it
    would be only a half-measure, or a parliament, and in the era of
    dictatorship questions cannot be settled, nor can the Party, or
    the Soviet organisations, be directed by parliamentary
    means. Comrades, now that we have taken over the bourgeois
    printing-presses and papers the importance of the Central
    Committee&#8217;s circular letters is not so great. We send out in
    the form of circular letters only such instructions as cannot be
    published, for in our activities, which were conducted publicly in
    spite of their vast dimensions, underground work nevertheless
    remained, still remains, and will remain. We were never afraid of
    being reproached for our underground methods and secrecy, but on
    the contrary were proud of them. And when we found ourselves in a
    situation in which, after overthrowing our bourgeoisie, we were
    faced with the hostility of the European bourgeoisie, secrecy
    remained a feature of our activities and underground methods a
    feature of our work.</p> 

    <p>With this, comrades, I conclude my report.

      <em>(Applause.</em>)</p>

    The conference to be held on Prinkipo, one of the Princes Islands,
    was proposed by the Entente powers and was to include
    representatives of all governments existing on the territory of
    Russia; its purpose was to establish peace. The Soviet Government
    did not receive a direct invitation to attend the conference and
    learned from foreign press reviews transmitted by wireless that
    since there had been no answer from the Soviet Government the
    imperialist powers were trying to prove to their peoples that this
    was a refusal to take part in the conference. The Soviet
    Government, in order to put a stop to all misrepresentations of
    its actions, on February 4, 1919 sent a wireless telegram to the
    governments of Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan and the
    U.S.A. consenting to start negotiations immediately and pointing
    out that it was prepared to make important concessions for the
    sake of peace. The Entente governments left the Soviet telegram
