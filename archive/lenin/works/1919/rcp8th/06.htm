    <h3>Report On Work In The Countryside</h3>

    <h4>March 23</h4>

    <p><em>(Prolonged applause.</em>) Comrades, I must apologise for
    having been unable to attend all the meetings of the committee
    elected by the Congress to consider the question of work in the
    countryside.<a id="bk20" href="#fw20" name="bk20"><sup
    class="enote">[20]</sup></a> My report will therefore be
    supplemented by the speeches of comrades who have taken part in
    the work of the committee from the very beginning. The committee
    finally drew up theses which were turned over to a commission and
    which will be reported on to you. I should like to dwell on the
    general significance of the question as it confronts us following
    the work of the committee and as, in my opinion, it now confronts
    the whole Party.</p> 

    <p>Comrades, it is quite natural that as the proletarian
    revolution develops we have to put in the forefront first one then
    another of the most complex and important problems of social
    life. It is perfectly natural that in a revolution which affects,
    and is bound to affect, the deepest foundations of life and the
    broadest mass of the population, not a single party, not a single
    government, no matter how close it may be to the people, can
    possibly embrace all aspects of life at once. And if we now have
    to deal with the question of work in the countryside, and in
    connection with this question to give prominence to the position
    of the middle peasants, there is nothing strange or abnormal in
    this from the standpoint of the development of the proletarian
    revolution in general. It is natural that the proletarian
    revolution had to begin with the fundamental relation between two
    hostile classes, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The
    principal task was to transfer power to the working class, to
    secure its dictatorship, to overthrow the bourgeoisie and to
    deprive them of the economic sources of their power which would
    undoubtedly be a hindrance to all socialist construction in
    general. Since we are acquainted with Marxism, none of us have
    ever for a moment doubted the truth of the thesis that the very
    economic structure of capitalist society is such that the deciding
    factor in that society must be either the proletariat or the
    bourgeoisie. We now see many former Marxists&#8212;from the
    Menshevik camp, for example&#8212;who assert that in a period of
    decisive struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie
    <em>democracy in general</em> can prevail. This is what is said by
    the Mensheviks, who have come to a complete agreement with the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries. Although it were not the bourgeoisie
    themselves who create or abolish democracy as they find most
    convenient for themselves! And since that is so, there can be no
    question of democracy in general at a time of acute struggle
    between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is astonishing how
    rapidly these Marxists or pseudo-Marxists&#8212;our Mensheviks,
    for example&#8212;expose themselves, and how rapidly their true
    nature, the nature of petty-bourgeois democrats, comes to the
    surface.</p> 

    <p>All his life Marx fought most of all the illusions of
    petti-bourgeois democracy and bourgeois democracy. Marx scoffed
    most of all at empty talk of freedom and equality, when it serves
    as a screen for the freedom of the workers to starve to death, or
    the equality between the one who sells his labour-power and the
    bourgeois who allegedly freely purchases that labour in the open
    market as if from an equal, and so forth. Marx explains this in
    all his economic works. It may be said that the whole of
    Marx&#8217;s <em>Capital</em> is devoted to explaining the truth
    that <em>the basic forces of capitalist society are</em>, <em>and
    must be</em>, <em>the bourgeoisie and the
    proletariat</em>&#8212;bourgeoisie, as the builder of this
    capitalist society, as its leader, as its motive force, and the
    proletariat, as its grave digger and as the only force capable of
    replacing it. You can hardly find a single chapter in any of
    Marx&#8217;s works that is not devoted to this. You might say that
    all over the world the socialists of the Second International have
    vowed and sworn to the workers time and again that they understand
    this truth. But when matters reached the stage of the real and,
    moreover, decisive struggle for power between the pro- letariat
    and the bourgeoisie we find that our Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, as well as the leaders of the old
    socialist parties all over the world, forgot this truth and began
    to repeat in purely parrot fashion the philistine phrases about
    democracy in general.</p> 

    <p>Attempts are sometimes made to lend these words what is
    considered to be greater force by speaking of the
    &#8220;dictatorship of democracy&#8221;. That is sheer
    nonsense. We know perfectly well from history that the
    dictatorship of the democratic bourgeoisie meant nothing but the
    suppression of the insurgent workers. That has been the case ever
    since 1848&#8212;at any rate, beginning no later, and isolated
    examples may be found even earlier. History shows that it is
    precisely in a bourgeois democracy that a most acute struggle
    between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie develops extensively
    and freely. We have had occasion to convince ourselves of this
    truth in practice. And the measures taken by the Soviet Government
    since October 1917 have been distinguished by their firmness on
    all fundamental questions precisely because we have never departed
    from this truth and have never forgotten it. The issue of the
    struggle for supremacy waged against the bourgeoisie can be
    settled only by the dictatorship of one class&#8212;the
    proletariat. Only the dictatorship of the proletariat can defeat
    the bourgeoisie. Only the proletariat can overthrow the
    bourgeoisie. And only the proletariat can secure the following of
    the people in the struggle against the bourgeoisie.</p> 

    <p>However, it by no means follows from this&#8212;and it would be
    a profound mistake to think it does&#8212;that in further building
    communism, when the bourgeoisie have been overthrown and political
    power is already in the hands of the proletariat, we can continue
    to carry on without the participation of the middle, intermediary
    elements.</p> 

    <p>It is natural that at the beginning of the revolution&#8212;the
    proletarian revolution&#8212;the whole attention of its active
    participants should be concentrated on the main and fundamental
    issue, the supremacy of the proletariat and the securing of that
    supremacy by a victory over the bourgeoisie&#8212; making it
    certain that the bourgeoisie cannot regain power. We are well
    aware that the bourgeoisie still enjoy the advantages derived from
    the wealth they possess in other countries or the monetary wealth
    they possess, sometimes even in our own country. We are well aware
    that there are social elements who are more experienced than
    proletarians and who aid the bourgeoisie. We are well aware that
    the bourgeoisie have not abandoned the idea of returning to power
    and have not ceased attempting to restore their supremacy.</p> 

    <p>But that is by no means all. The bourgeoisie, who put forward
    most insistently the principle &#8220;my country is whereever it
    is good for me&#8221;, and who, as far as money is concerned, have
    always been international&#8212;<em>the bourgeoisie
    internationally are still stronger than we are.</em> Their
    supremacy is being rapidly undermined, they are being confronted
    with such facts as the Hungarian revolution&#8212;about which we
    were happy to inform you yesterday and are today receiving
    confirming reports&#8212;and they are beginning to understand that
    their supremacy is shaky. They no longer enjoy freedom of
    action. But now, if you take into account the material means on
    the world scale, we cannot help admitting that in the material
    respect the bourgeoisie are at present still stronger than we
    are.</p> 

    <p>That is why nine-tenths of our attention and our practical
    activities were devoted, and had to be devoted, to this
    fundamental question&#8212;the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, the
    establishment of the power of the proletariat and the elimination
    of every possibility of the return of the bourgeoisie to
    power. That is perfectly natural, legitimate, and unavoidable, and
    in this field very much has been accomplished.</p> 

    <p>Now, however, we must decide the question of other sections of
    the population. We must&#8212;and this was our unanimous
    conclusion in the agrarian committee, and on this, we are
    convinced, all Party workers will agree, because we merely summed
    up the results of their observations&#8212;we must now decide
    <em>the question of the middle peasants</em> in its totality.</p> 

    <p>Of course, there are people who, instead of studying the course
    taken by our revolution, instead of giving thought to the tasks
    now confronting us, instead of all this, make every step of the
    Soviet government a butt for the derision and criticism of the
    type we hear from these gentlemen, the Mensheviks and the Right
    Socialist-Revolutionaries. These people have still not understood
    that they must make a choice between us and the bourgeois
    dictatorship. We have displayed great patience, even indulgence,
    towards these people. We shall allow them to enjoy our indulgence
    once more. But in the very near future we shall set a limit to our
    patience and indulgence, and if they do not make their choice, we
    shall tell them in all seriousness to go to
    Kolchak. <em>(Applause.</em>) We do not expect particularly
    brilliant intellectual ability from such
    people. <em>(Laughter.</em>) But it might have been expected that
    after experiencing the bestialities of Kolchak they ought to
    understand that we are entitled to demand that they should choose
    between us and Kolchak. If during the first few months that
    followed the October Revolution there were many na&#239;ve people
    who were stupid enough to believe that the dictatorship of the
    proletariat was something transient and fortuitous, today even the
    Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries ought to understand
    that there is something logically necessary in the struggle that
    is being waged because of the onslaught of the whole international
    bourgeoisie.</p> 

    <p>Actually only two forces have been created&#8212;the
    dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and the dictatorship of the
    proletariat. Whoever has not learned this from Marx, whoever has
    not learned this from the works of all the great socialists, has
    never been a socialist, has never understood anything about
    socialism, and has only called himself a socialist. We are
    allowing these people a brief period for reflection and demand
    that they make their decision. I have mentioned them because they
    are now saying or will say: &#8220;The Bolsheviks have raised the
    question of the middle peasants; they want to make advances to
    them.&#8221; I am very well aware that considerable space is given
    in the Menshevik press to arguments of this kind, and even far
    worse. We ignore such arguments, we never attach importance to the
    jabber of our adversaries. People who are still capable of running
    to and fro between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat may say
    what they please. We are following our own road.</p> 

    <p>Our road is determined above all by considerations of class
    forces. A struggle is developing in capitalist society between the
    bourgeoisie and the proletariat. As long as that struggle has not
    ended we shall give our keenest attention to fighting it out to
    the end. It has not yet been brought to the end, although in that
    struggle much has already been accomplished. The hands of the
    international bourgeoisie are no longer free; the best proof of
    this is that the Hungarian proletarian revolution has taken
    place. It is therefore clear that our rural organisational work
    has already gone beyond the limits to which it was confined when
    everything was subordinated to the fundamental demand of the
    struggle for power.</p> 

    <p>This development passed through two main phases. In October
    1917 we seized power <em>together with the peasants as a
    whole.</em> This was a bourgeois revolution, inasmuch as the class
    struggle in the rural districts had not yet developed. As I have
    said, the real proletarian revolution in the rural districts began
    only in the summer of 1918. Had we not succeeded in stirring up
    this revolution our work would have been incomplete. The first
    stage was the seizure of power in the cities and the establishment
    of the Soviet form of government. The second stage was one which
    is fundamental for all socialists and without which socialists are
    not socialists, namely, to single out the proletarian and
    semi-proletarian elements in the rural districts and to ally them
    to the urban proletariat in order to wage the struggle against the
    bourgeoisie in the countryside. This stage is also in the main
    completed. The organisations we originally created for this
    purpose, the Poor Peasants&#8217; Committees, had become so
    consolidated that we found it possible to replace them by properly
    elected Soviets, i.e., to reorganise the village Soviets so as to
    make them the organs of class rule, the organs of proletarian
    power in the rural districts. Such measures as the law on
    socialist land settlement and the measures for the transition to
    socialist farming, which was passed not very long ago by the
    Central Executive Committee and with which everybody is, of
    course, familiar, sum up our experience from the point of view of
    our proletarian revolution.</p> 

    <p>The main thing, the prime and basic talk of the proletarian
    revolution, we have already accomplished. And precisely because we
    have accomplished it, a more complicated problem has come to the
    fore&#8212;<em>our attitude towards the middle peasants.</em> And
    whoever thinks that the prominence being given this problem is in
    any way symptomatic of a weakening of the character of our
    government, of a weakening of the dictatorship of the proletariat,
    that it is symptomatic of a change, however partial, however
    minute, in our basic policy, completely fails to understand the
    aims of the proletariat and the aims of the communist
    revolution. I am convinced that there are no such people in our
    Party. I only wanted to warn the comrades against people not
    belonging to the workers&#8217; party who will talk in this way,
    not because it follows from any system of ideas, but because they
    merely want to spoil things for us and to help the
    whiteguards&#8212;or, to put it more simply, to incite against us
    the middle peasant, who is always vacillating, who cannot help
    vacillating, and who will continue to vacillate for a fairly long
    time to come. In order to incite the middle peasant against us
    they will say, &#8220;See, they are making advances to you! That
    means they have taken your revolts into account, they are
    beginning to wobble&#8221;, and so on and so forth. All our
    comrades must be armed against agitation of this kind. And I am
    certain that they will be armed&#8212;provided we succeed now in
    having this question treated from the standpoint of the class
    struggle.</p> 

    <p>It is perfectly obvious that this fundamental
    problem&#8212;<em>how precisely to define the attitude of the
    proletariat towards the middle peasants</em>&#8212;is a more
    complex but no less urgent problem. Comrades, from the theoretical
    point of view, which has been mastered by the vast majority of the
    workers, this question presents no difficulty to Marxists. I will
    remind you, for instance, that in his book on the agrarian
    question, written at a time when he was still correctly expounding
    the teachings of Marx and was regarded as an indisputed authority
    in this field, Kautsky states in connection with the transition
    from capitalism to socialism that the task of a socialist party
    <em>is to neutralise the peasants</em>, i.e., to see to it that in
    the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie the
    peasant should remain neutral and should not be able to give
    active assistance to the bourgeoisie against us.</p> 

    <p>Throughout the extremely long period of the rule of the
    bourgeoisie, the peasants sided with the bourgeoisie and supported
    their power. This will be understood if you consider the economic
    strength of the bourgeoisie and the political instruments of their
    rule. We cannot count on the middle peasant coming over to our
    side immediately. But if we pursue a correct policy, after a time
    these vacillations will cease and the peasant will be able to come
    over to our side.</p> 

    <p>It was Engels&#8212;who together with Marx laid the foundations
    of scientific Marxism, that is, the teachings by which our Party
    has always guided itself, and particularly in time of
    revolution&#8212;it was Engels who established the division of the
    peasants into small peasants, middle peasants, and big peasants,
    and this division holds good for most European countries even
    today. Engels said, &#8220;Perhaps it will not everywhere be
    necessary to suppress even the big peasant by force.&#8221; And
    that we might ever use force in respect of the middle peasant (the
    small peasant is our friend) is a thought that has never occurred
    to any sensible socialist. That is what Engels said in 1894, a
    year before his death, when the agrarian question came to the
    fore.<a id="bk21" href="#fw21" name="bk21"><sup
    class="enote">[21]</sup></a> This point of view expresses a truth
    which is sometimes forgotten, but with which we are all in theory
    agreed. In relation to the landowners and the capitalists our aim
    is complete expropriation. <em>But we shall not tolerate any use
    of force in respect of the middle peasants.</em> Even in respect
    of the rich peasants we do not say as resolutely as we do of the
    bourgeoisie&#8212;absolute expropriation of the rich peasants and
    the kulaks. This distinction is made in our programme. We say that
    the resistance of the counter-revolutionary efforts of the rich
    peasants must be suppressed. That is not complete
    expropriation.</p> 

    <p>The basic difference in our attitude towards the bourgeoisie
    and the middle peasant&#8212;complete expropriation of the
    bourgeoisie and an alliance with the middle peasant who does not
    exploit others&#8212;this basic line is accepted by everybody in
    theory. But this line is not consistently followed in practice;
    the people in the localities have not yet learned to follow
    it. When, after having overthrown the bourgeoisie and consolidated
    its own power, the proletariat started from various angles to
    create a new society, the question of the middle peasant came to
    the fore. Not a single socialist in the world denied that the
    building of communism would take different courses in countries
    where large-scale farming prevails and in countries where
    small-scale farming prevails. That is an elementary truth, an
    ABC. And from this truth it follows that as we approach the
    problems of communist construction our principal attention must to
    a certain extent be concentrated precisely on the middle
    peasant.</p> 

    <p>Much will depend on how we define our attitude towards the
    middle peasant. Theoretically, that question has been solved; but
    we know perfectly well from our own experience that there is a
    difference between solving a problem theoretically and putting the
    solution into practice. We are now directly confronted with that
    difference, which was so characteristic of the great French
    Revolution, when the French Convention launched into sweeping
    measures but did not possess the necessary support to put them
    into effect, and did not even know on what class to rely for the
    implementation of any particular measure.</p> 

    <p>Our position is an infinitely more fortunate one. Thanks to a
    whole century of development, we know on which class we are
    relying. But we also know that the practical experience of that
    class is extremely inadequate. The fundamental aim was clear to
    the working class and the workers&#8217; party&#8212;to overthrow
    the power of the bourgeoisie and to transfer power to the
    workers. But how was that to be done? Everyone remembers with what
    difficulty and at the cost of how many mistakes we passed from
    workers&#8217; control to workers&#8217; management of
    industry. And yet that was work within our own class, among the
    proletarians, with whom we had always had to deal. But now we are
    called upon to define our attitude towards a new class, a class
    the urban worker does not know. We have to determine our attitude
    towards a class which has no definite and stable position. The
    proletariat in the mass is in favour of socialism, the bourgeoisie
    in the mass are opposed to socialism. It is easy to determine the
    relations between these two classes. But when we come up against
    people like the middle peasants we find that they are a class that
    vacillates. The middle peasant is partly a property-owner and
    partly a working man. He does not exploit other working
    people. For decades the middle peasant defended his position with
    the greatest difficulty, he suffered the exploitation of the
    landowners and the capitalists, he bore everything. Yet he is a
    property-owner. Our attitude towards this vacillating class
    therefore presents enormous difficulties. In the light of more
    than a year&#8217;s experience, in the light of more than six
    months&#8217; proletarian work in the rural districts, and in the
    light of the class differentiation in the rural districts that has
    already taken place, we must most of all beware here lest we are
    too hasty, lest we are in adequately theoretical, lest we regard
    what is in process of being accomplished, but has not yet been
    realised, as having been accomplished. In the resolution which is
    being proposed to you by the commission elected by the committee,
    and which will be read to you by a subsequent speaker, you will
    find sufficient warning against this.</p> 

    <p>From the economic point of view, it is obvious that we must
    help the middle peasant. Theoretically, there is no doubt of
    this. But because of our habits, our level of culture, the
    inadequacy of the cultural and technical forces we are in a
    position to place at the disposal of the rural districts, and
    because of the helpless manner in which we often approach the
    rural districts, comrades frequently resort to coercion and thus
    spoil everything. Only yesterday a comrade gave me a pamphlet
    entitled <em>Instructions and Regulations on Party Work in
    Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia</em>, issued by the Nizhni-Novgorod
    Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and in this
    pamphlet, for example, I find this on p. 41. &#8220;The whole
    burden of the emergency tax decree must be placed on the shoulders
    of the village kulaks and profiteers and <em>the middle element of
    the peasants generally.</em>&#8221;<a id="bk22" href="#fw22"
    name="bk22"><sup class="enote">[22]</sup></a> Well, well! These
    people have indeed &#8220;understood&#8221;. This is either a
    printer&#8217;s error&#8212;and it is impermissible that such
    printer&#8217;s errors should be made&#8212;or a piece of rushed,
    hasty work, which shows how dangerous all haste is in this
    matter. Or&#8212;and this is the worst surmise of all, one I would
    not like to make with regard to the Nizhni-Novgorod
    comrades&#8212;they have simply failed to understand. It may very
    well be that it is an oversight.</p> 

    <p>We have, in practice, cases like the one related by a comrade
    in the commission. He was surrounded by peasants, and every one of
    them asked: &#8220;Tell me, am I a middle peasant or not? I have
    two horses and one cow. . . . I have two cows and one
    horse&#8221;, etc. And this agitator, who tours the uyezds, is
    expected to possess an infallible thermometer with which to gauge
    every peasant and say whether he is a middle peasant or not. To do
    that you must know the whole history of the given peasant&#8217;s
    farm, his relation to higher and lower groups&#8212;and we cannot
    know that accurately.</p> 

    <p>Considerable practical ability and knowledge of local
    conditions are required here, and we do not yet possess them. You
    need not be ashamed to confess it; it must be admitted frankly. We
    were never utopians and never imagined that we would build
    communist society with the immaculate hands of immaculate
    Communists, born and educated in an immaculately communist
    society. That is a fairy tale. We have to build communism out of
    the debris of capitalism, and only the class which has been
    steeled in the struggle against capitalism can do that. The
    proletariat, as you are very well aware, is not free from the
    shortcomings and weaknesses of capitalist society. It is fighting
    for socialism, but at the same time it is fighting against its own
    shortcomings. The best and foremost section of the proletariat,
    which carried on a desperate struggle in the cities for decades,
    was in a position to acquire in the course of that struggle the
    culture of life in the capital and other cities, and to a certain
    extent did acquire it. You know that even in advanced countries
    the rural districts were condemned to ignorance. Of course, we
    shall raise the level of culture in the rural districts, but that
    will be the work of many, many years, that is what our comrades
    everywhere are forgetting and what is being strikingly brought
    home to us by every word uttered by people who come from the rural
    districts; not by the intellectuals who work here, not by the
    officials&#8212;we have listened to them a lot&#8212;but by people
    who have in practice observed the work in the rural districts. It
    was these opinions that we found particularly valuable in the
    agrarian committee. These opinions will be particularly valuable
    now&#8212;I am convinced of that&#8212;for the whole Party
    Congress, for they come not from books, and not from decrees, but
    from experience.</p> 

    <p>All this obliges us to work for the purpose of introducing the
    greatest possible clarity into our attitude towards the middle
    peasant. This is very difficult, because <em>such clarity does not
    exist in reality.</em> Not only is this problem unsolved, it is
    <em>insoluble</em>, if you want to solve it <em>immediately and
    all at once.</em> There are people who say that there was no need
    to write so many decrees. They blame the Soviet Government for
    setting about writing decrees without knowing how they were to be
    put into effect. These people, as a matter of fact, do not realise
    that they are sinking to the whiteguard position. If we had
    expected that life in the rural districts could be completely
    changed by writing a hundred decrees, we would have been absolute
    idiots. But if we had refrained from indicating in decrees the
    road that must be followed, we would have been traitors to
    socialism. These decrees, while in practice they could not be
    carried into effect fully and immediately, played an important
    part as propaganda. While formerly we carried on our propaganda by
    means of general truths, <em>we are now carrying on our propaganda
    by our work.</em> That is also preaching, but it is preaching by
    action&#8212;only not action in the sense of the isolated sallies
    of some upstarts, at which we scoffed so much in the era of the
    anarchists and the socialism of the old type. Our decree is a
    call, but not the old call &#8220;Workers, arise and overthrow the
    bourgeoisie!&#8221; No, it is a call to the people, it calls them
    to practical work. <em>Decrees are instructions which call for
    practical work on a mass scale.</em> That is what is
    important. Let us assume that decrees do contain much that is
    useless, much that in practice cannot be put into effect; but they
    contain material for practical action, and the purpose of a decree
    is to teach practical steps to the hundreds, thousands, and
    millions of people who heed the voice of the Soviet
    government. This is a trial in practical action in the sphere of
    socialist construction in the rural districts. If we treat matters
    in this way we shall acquire a good deal from the sum total of our
    laws, decrees, and ordinances. We shall not regard them as
    absolute injunctions which must be put into effect instantly and
    at all costs.</p> 

    <p>We must avoid everything that in practice may tend to encourage
    individual abuses. In places careerists and adventurers have
    attached themselves to us like leeches, people who call themselves
    Communists and are deceiving us, and who have wormed their way
    into our ranks because the Communists are now in power, and
    because the more honest government employees refused to come and
    work with us on account of their retrograde ideas, while
    careerists have no ideas, and no honesty. These people, whose only
    aim is to make a career, resort in the localities to coercion, and
    imagine they are doing a good thing. But in fact the result of
    this at times is that the peasants say, &#8220;Long live Soviet
    power, but <em>down with the communia</em>!&#8221; (i.e.,
    communism). This is not an invention; these facts are taken from
    real life, from the reports of comrades in the localities. We must
    not forget what enormous damage is always caused by lack of
    moderation, by all rashness, and haste.</p> 

    <p>We had to hurry and, by taking a desperate leap, to get out of
    the imperialist war at any cost, for it had brought us to the
    verge of collapse. We had to make most desperate efforts to crush
    the bourgeoisie and the forces that were threatening to crush
    us. All this was necessary, without this we could not have
    triumphed. But if we were to act in the same way towards the
    middle peasant it would be such idiocy, such stupidity, it would
    be so ruinous to our cause, that only provocateurs could
    deliberately act in such a way. The aim here must be an entirely
    different one. Here our aim is not to smash the resistance of
    obvious exploiters, to defeat and overthrow them&#8212;which was
    the aim we previously set ourselves. No, now that this main
    purpose has been accomplished, more complicated problems
    arise. You cannot create anything here by coercion. <em>Coercion
    applied to the middle peasants would cause untold harm.</em> This
    section is a numerous one, it consists of millions of
    individuals. Even in Europe, where it nowhere reaches such
    numbers, where technology and culture, urban life and railways are
    tremendously developed, and where it would be easiest of all to
    think of such a thing, nobody, not even the most revolutionary of
    socialists, has ever proposed adopting measures of coercion
    towards the middle peasant.</p> 

    <p>When we were taking power we relied on the support of the
    peasants as a whole. At that time the aim of all the peasants was
    the same&#8212;to fight the landowners. But their prejudice
    against large-scale farming has remained to this day. The peasant
    thinks that if there is a big farm, that means he will again be a
    farm-hand. That, of course, is a mistake. But the peasant&#8217;s
    idea of large-scale farming is associated with a feeling of hatred
    and the memory of how landowners used to oppress the people. That
    feeling still remains, it has not yet died.</p> 

    <p>We must particularly stress the truth that here by the very
    nature of the case coercive methods can accomplish nothing. The
    economic task here is an entirely different one; there is no upper
    layer that can be cut off, leaving the foundation and the building
    intact. That upper layer which in the cities was represented by
    the capitalists does not exist in the villages. <em>Here coercion
    would ruin the whole cause.</em> Prolonged educational work is
    required. We have to give the peasant, who not only in our country
    but all over the world is a practical man and a realist, concrete
    examples to prove that the &#8220;communia&#8221; is the best
    possible thing. Of course, nothing will come of it if hasty
    individuals flit down to a village from a city to chatter and stir
    up a number of intellectual-like and at times unintellectual-like
    squabbles, and then quarrel with everyone and go their way. That
    sometimes happens. Instead of evoking respect, they evoke
    ridicule, and deservedly so.</p> 

    <p>On this question we must say that we do encourage communes, but
    they must be so organised <em>as to gain the confidence of the
    peasants.</em> And until then we are pupils of the peasants and
    not their teachers. Nothing is more stupid than people who know
    nothing about farming and its specific features, rushing to the
    village only because they have heard of the advantages of
    socialised farming, are tired of urban life and desire to work in
    rural districts&#8212;it is most stupid for such people to regard
    themselves as teachers of the peasants in every
    respect. <em>Nothing is more stupid than the very idea of applying
    coercion in economic relations with the middle peasant.</em></p> 

    <p>The aim is not to expropriate the middle peasant but to bear in
    mind the specific conditions in which the peasant lives, to learn
    from him methods of transition to a better system, <em>and not to
    dare to give orders</em>! That is the rule we have set
    ourselves. <em>(General applause.</em>) That is the rule we have
    endeavoured to set forth in our draft resolution, for in that
    respect, comrades, we have indeed sinned a great deal. We are by
    no means ashamed to confess it. We were inexperienced. Our very
    struggle against the exploiters was taken from experience. If we
    have sometimes been condemned on account of it, we can say,
    &#8220;Dear capitalist gentlemen, you have only yourselves to
    blame. If you had not offered such savage, senseless, insolent,
    and desperate resistance, if you had not joined in an alliance
    with the world bourgeoi- sie, the revolution would have assumed
    more peaceful forms.&#8221; Now that we have repulsed the savage
    onslaught on all sides we can change to other methods, because we
    are acting not as a narrow circle, but as a party which is leading
    the millions. The millions cannot immediately understand a change
    of course, and so it frequently happens that blows aimed at the
    kulaks fall on the middle peasants. That is not surprising. It
    must only be understood that this is due to historical conditions
    which have now been outlived and that the new conditions and the
    new tasks in relation to this class demand a new psychology.</p> 

    <p>Our decrees on peasant farming are in the main correct. We have
    no grounds for renouncing a single one of them, or for regretting
    a single one of them. But if the decrees are right, <em>it is
    wrong to impose them on the peasants by force.</em> That is not
    contained in a single decree. They are right inasmuch as they
    indicate the roads to follow, inasmuch as they call to practical
    measures. When we say, &#8220;Encourage associations&#8221;, we
    are giving instructions which must be tested many times before the
    final <em>form</em> in which to put them into effect is
    found. When it is stated that we must strive to gain the
    peasants&#8217; voluntary consent, it means that they must be
    persuaded, and persuaded by practical deeds. They will not allow
    themselves to be convinced by mere words, and they are perfectly
    right in that. It would be a bad thing if they allowed themselves
    to be convinced merely by reading decrees and agitational
    leaflets. If it were possible to reshape economic life in this
    way, such reshaping would not be worth a brass farthing. It must
    first be proved that such association is better, people must be
    united in such a way that they become actually united and are not
    at odds with each other&#8212;it must be proved that association
    is advantageous. That is the way the peasant puts the question and
    that is the way our decrees put it. If we have not been able to
    achieve that so far, there is nothing to be ashamed of and we must
    admit it frankly.</p> 

    <p>We have so far accomplished only the fundamental task of every
    socialist revolution&#8212;that of defeating the bourgeoisie. That
    in the main has been accomplished, although an extremely difficult
    half-year is beginning in which the imperialists of the world are
    making a last attempt to crush us. We can now say without in the
    least exaggerating that <em>they themselves understand that after
    this half-year their cause will be absolutely hopeless.</em>
    Either they take advantage now of our state of exhaustion and
    defeat us, an isolated country, or we emerge victorious not merely
    in regard to our country alone. In this half-year, in which the
    food crisis has been aggravated by a transport crisis, and in
    which the imperialist powers are endeavouring to attack us on
    several fronts, our situation is extremely difficult. But <em>this
    is the last difficult half-year.</em> We must continue to mobilise
    all our forces in the struggle against the external enemy who is
    attacking us.</p> 

    <p>But when we speak of the aims of our work in the rural
    districts, in spite of all the difficulties, and in spite of the
    fact that our experience has been wholly concerned with the
    immediate task of crushing the exploiters, we must remember, and
    never forget, that our aims in the rural districts, in relation to
    the middle peasant, are entirely different.</p> 

    <p>All the class-conscious workers&#8212;from Petrograd,
    Ivanovo-Voznesensk, or Moscow&#8212;who have been to the rural
    districts related examples of how a number of misunderstandings
    which appeared to be irremovable, and a number of conflicts which
    appeared to be very serious, were removed or mitigated when
    intelligent working men came forward and spoke, not in the bookish
    language, but in a language understood by the peasants, when they
    spoke not as commanders who take the liberty of giving orders
    without knowing any thing of rural life, but as comrades,
    explaining the situation and appealing to their sentiments as
    working people against the exploiters. And by such comradely
    explanation they accomplished what could not be accomplished by
    hundreds of others who conducted themselves like commanders and
    superiors.</p> 

    <p>That is the spirit that permeates the resolution we are now
    submitting to you.</p> 

    <p>I have endeavoured in my brief report to dwell on the
    underlying principles, on the general political significance of
    this resolution. I have endeavoured to show&#8212;and I should
    like to think that I have succeeded&#8212;that from the point of
    view of the interests of the revolution as a whole we are making
    no change of policy, we are not changing the line. The whiteguards
    and their henchmen are shouting, or will shout, that we are. Let
    them shout. We do not care. We are pursuing our aims in a most
    consistent manner. We must transfer our attention from the aim of
    suppressing the bourgeoisie to the aim of arranging the life of
    the middle peasant. We must live in peace with him. In a communist
    society the middle peasants will be on our side only when we
    alleviate and improve their economic conditions. If tomorrow we
    could supply one hundred thousand first-class tractors, provide
    them with fuel, provide them with drivers&#8212;you know very well
    that this at present is sheer fantasy&#8212;the middle peasant
    would say, &#8220;I am for the communia&#8221; (i.e., for
    communism). But in order to do that we must first defeat the
    international bourgeoisie, we must compel them to give us those
    tractors, or so develop our productive forces as to be able to
    provide them ourselves. That is the only correct way to pose this
    question.</p> 

    <p>The peasant needs the industry of the towns; he cannot live
    without it, and it is in our hands. If we set about the task
    properly, the peasant will be grateful to us for bringing him
    these products, these implements and this culture from the
    towns. They will be brought to him not by exploiters, not by
    landowners, but by his fellow-workers, whom he values very highly,
    but values in a practical manner, for the actual help they give,
    at the same time rejecting&#8212;and quite rightly
    rejecting&#8212;all domineering and &#8220;orders&#8221; from
    above.</p> 

    <p>First help, and then endeavour to win confidence. If you set
    about this task correctly, if every step taken by every one of our
    groups in the uyezds, the volosts, the food procurement groups,
    and in every other organisation is made properly, if every step of
    ours is carefully checked from this point of view, we shall gain
    the confidence of the peasant, and only then shall we be able to
    proceed farther; What we must now do is to help him and advise
    him. This will not be the orders of a commander, but the advice of
    a comrade. The peasant will then be entirely on our side.</p> 

    <p>This, comrades, is what is contained in our resolution, and
    this, in my opinion, must become the decision of the Congress. If
    we adopt this, if it serves to determine the work of all our Party
    organisations, we shall cope with the second great task before
    us.</p> 

    <p>We have learned how to overthrow the bourgeoisie, how to suppress
      them, and we are proud of the fact. But we have not yet learned
      how to regulate our relations with the millions of middle
      peasants, how to win their confidence, and we must frankly admit
      it. But we have understood the task, we have set it, and we say
      in all confidence, with full knowledge and determination, that
      we shall cope with this task&#8212;and then socialism will be
      absolutely invincible. <em>(Prolonged applause.</em>)</p>

    <em>The committee on work in the countryside</em> was set up at
    the first sitting of the Eighth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) on
    March 18, 1919. It held three sessions which heard reports on the
    land policy, and work in the countryside, and elected a commission
    to draw up resolutions. Lenin&#8217;s resolution on the attitude
    to the middle peasantry and a resolution on political propaganda
    and cultural and educational work in the countryside were then
    approved by the Congress.</p>
