    <h3>Endnotes</h3>

    <p class="endnote"><a id="fw01" href="#bk01" name="fw01">[1]</a> This
      Congress of the R.C.P.(B.), held in Moscow, was attended by 301 delegates
      with the right to vote who represented 313,766 Party members and 102
      delegates with voice but no vote. Lenin opened the Congress with a short
      speech. The Congress agenda was: report of the Central Committee, the
      Programme of the R.C.P.(B.), the foundation of the Communist
      International, the war situation and war policy, work in the countryside,
      organisational problems, and other business.</p>

    <p class="endnote">Lenin delivered the report of the Central Committee and
      also reported on the Party Programme and work in the countryside.</p>

    <p class="endnote">In a resolution on the report of the Central Committee
      the Congress expressed its full &#8220;approval of the political
      activities of the Central Committee&#8221;.</p>

    <p class="endnote">In the sphere of military affairs the Congress adopted a
      decision to strengthen the regular Red Army, lead by Trotsky, and
      inculcate iron discipline, stressing especially the role of the
      proletarian hard core of the army and the role of the commissars and Party
      cells in the political and military training of the Red Army. The Congress
      pointed to the need, developed by Trotsky with Lenin&#8217;s support, to
      employ old army specialists and to make use of the highest achievements of
      the bourgeois art of war. The Congress vehemently rejected the proposal
      from the group known as the &#8220;army opposition&#8221; that was against
      the formation of a regular Red Army and defended the survivals of the
      guerrilla spirit in the army.</p>

    <p class="endnote">The Congress adopted a decision on Party and Soviet
      organisation and defeated the opportunist group headed by Sapronov and
      Osinsky who denied the leading role of the Party in the Soviets.</p>

    <p class="endnote">Owing to the large influx of new members into the Party
      the Congress decided to carry out the re-registration of the entire
      membership and to improve the Party&#8217;s social composition.</p>

    <p class="endnote">Among the members of the Central Committee elected by the
      Congress were Lenin, Dzerzhinsky, Kalinin and Stasova; among the
      alternative members were Artyom (Sergeyev), Vladimirsky and
      Yaroslavsky.</p>
