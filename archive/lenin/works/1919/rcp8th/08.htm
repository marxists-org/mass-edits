    <h3>Resolution On The Attitude To The Middle Peasants</h3>

    <p>Basing itself on the Party Programme adopted on March 22, 1919,
    insofar as it concerns work in the rural areas, and giving full
    support to the law already promulgated by the Soviet government on
    socialist land settlement and the measures for the transition to
    socialist farming, the Eighth Congress recognises that at the
    present time it is particularly important to adhere more strictly
    to the line of the Party in respect of the middle peasants, to
    display a more considerate attitude towards their needs, end
    arbitrary action on the part of the local authorities, and make an
    effort towards agreement with them.</p> 

    <p>1) To confuse the middle peasants with the kulaks and to extend
    to them in one or another degree measures directed against the
    kulaks is to violate most flagrantly not only all the decrees of
    the Soviet government and its entire policy, but also all the
    basic principles of communism, according to which agreement
    between the proletariat and the middle peasants is one of the
    conditions for a painless transition to the abolition of all
    exploitation in the period of decisive struggle waged by the
    proletariat to overthrow the bourgeoisie.</p> 

    <p>2) The middle peasants, who have comparatively strong economic
    roots owing to the lagging of agricultural techniques behind
    industrial techniques even in the leading capitalist countries, to
    say nothing of Russia, will continue to exist for quite a long
    time after the beginning of the proletarian revolution. Therefore,
    the tactics of the functionaries of the Soviets in the villages,
    as well as of Party functionaries, must envisage a long period of
    co-operation with the middle peasants.</p> 

    <p>3) The Party must at all costs ensure that all Soviet
    functionaries in the countryside have a clear and thorough grasp
    of the axiom of scientific socialism that the middle peasants are
    not exploiters since they do not profit by the labour of
    others. Such a class of small producers cannot lose by socialism,
    but, on the contrary, will gain a great deal by casting off the
    yoke of capital which exploits it in a thousand different ways
    even in a most democratic republic.</p> 

    <p>The correctly applied policy of Soviet power in the
    countryside, therefore, ensures alliance and agreement between the
    victorious proletariat and the middle peasants.</p> 

    <p>4) While encouraging co-operatives of all kinds as well as
    agricultural communes of middle peasants, representatives of
    Soviet power must not allow the slightest coercion to be used in
    setting them up. Associations are only worth while when they have
    been set up by the peasants themselves, on their own initiative,
    and the benefits of them have been verified in practice. Undue
    haste in this matter is harmful, for it can only strengthen
    prejudices against innovations among the middle peasants.</p> 

    <p>Representatives of Soviet power who permit themselves to employ
    not only direct but even indirect compulsion to bring peasants
    into communes must be brought strictly to account and removed from
    work in the countryside.</p> 

    <p>5) All arbitrary requisitioning, i.e., requisitioning not in
    conformity with the exact provisions of laws issued by the central
    authority, must be ruthlessly punished. The Congress insists on
    the strengthening of control in this field by the People&#8217;s
    Commissariat of Agriculture, People&#8217;s Commissariat of the
    Interior, and the All-Russia Central Executive Committee.</p> 

    <p>6) At the present time the extreme chaos which has been caused
    in all countries of the world by the four years of imperialist war
    in the predatory interests of the capitalists, and which has
    become particularly acute in Russia, places the middle peasants in
    a difficult position.</p> 

    <p>In view of this, the law issued by the Soviet government on the
    emergency tax, as distinct from all the laws issued by all the
    bourgeois governments in the world, makes a point of laying the
    burden of the tax wholly on the kulaks, the inconsiderable number
    of peasant exploiters who particularly enriched themselves during
    the war. The middle peasants must be taxed very mildly, so that
    the sum levied is fully within their means and not burdensome to
    them.</p> 

    <p>The Party demands, in any case, lenience towards the middle
    peasants in collecting the emergency tax, even if this reduces the
    total revenue.</p> 

    <p>7) The socialist state must extend the widest possible aid to
    the peasants, mainly by supplying the middle peasants with
    products of urban industries and, especially, improved
    agricultural implements, seed and various materials in order to
    raise efficiency in agriculture and ensure improvement of the
    peasants&#8217; working and living conditions.</p> 

    <p>If the present economic chaos does not allow the immediate and
    full implementation of these measures, it remains the duty of
    local Soviet authorities to explore all possible avenues to render
    the poor and middle peasants any real aid to support them at the
    present difficult moment. The Party finds it necessary to
    establish a large state fund for this purpose.</p> 

    <p>8) In particular, efforts must be made to give real and full
    effect to the law issued by the Soviet government which requires
    of state farms, agricultural communes, and all other similar
    associations that they render immediate and all-round assistance
    to the middle peasants in their neighbourhood. Only on the basis
    of such actual assistance is it possible to achieve agreement with
    the middle peasants. Only in this way can and must their
    confidence be won.</p> 

    <p>The Congress draws the attention of all Party workers to the
    need to put into effect immediately all the points set forth in
    the agrarian section of the Party Programme, namely:</p> 

    <p>(a) regulation of the use of land by the peasants (elimination
    of scattered holdings, the open field system, etc.), (b)supply of
    improved seeds and artificial fertilisers to the peasants, (c)
    improvement of the breeds of the peasants&#8217; livestock, (d)
    spreading of agronomical knowledge, (e) agronomical assistance to
    the peasants, (f) repair of the peasants&#8217; farm implements at
    repair shops belonging to the Soviets, (g) organisation of centres
    hiring out implements, experi- mental stations, model fields,
    etc., (h) improvements to the peasants&#8217; land.</p> 

    <p>9) Peasants&#8217; co-operative associations with the object of
    increasing agricultural production, and especially of processing
    farm produce, improvements to the peasants&#8217; land, support of
    handicraft industries, etc., must be accorded extensive aid, both
    financial and organisational, by the state.</p> 

    <p>10) The Congress reminds all concerned that neither the
    decisions of the Party nor the decrees of Soviet power have ever
    deviated from the line of agreement with the middle peasants. In
    the cardinal matter of the organisation of Soviet power in the
    countryside, for instance, a circular letter signed by the
    Chairman of the Council of People&#8217;s Commissars and the
    People&#8217;s Commissar for Food was issued when the Poor
    Peasants&#8217; Committees were established, pointing to the need
    to include in these Committees representatives of the middle
    peasants. When the Poor Peasants&#8217; Committees were abolished,
    the All-Russia Congress of Soviets again pointed to the need to
    include representatives of the middle peasants in the volost
    Soviets. The policy of the workers&#8217; and peasants&#8217;
    government and the Communist Party must in the future too be
    permeated by this spirit of agreement between the proletariat and
    the poor peasants on the one hand, and the middle peasants on the
    other.</p>
