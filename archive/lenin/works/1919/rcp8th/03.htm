    <h3>Report On The Party Programme</h3>

    <h4>March 19</h4>

    <p><em>(Applause.</em>) Comrades, according to the division of
    subjects agreed on between Comrade Bukharin and myself, it is my
    task to explain the point of view of the commission on a number of
    concrete and most disputed points, or points which interest the
    Party most at the present time.</p> 

    <p>I shall begin by dealing briefly with the points which Comrade
    Bukharin touched on at the end of his report as points of dispute
    among us in the commission; The first relates to the structure of
    the preamble to the programme. In my opinion, Comrade Bukharin did
    not quite correctly explain here the reason the majority on the
    commission rejected all attempts to draw up the programme in such
    a way that everything relating to the old capitalism would be
    deleted. By the way Comrade Bukharin spoke he sometimes seemed to
    imply that the majority on the commission was apprehensive of what
    might be said about this, apprehensive that they would be accused
    of insufficient respect for the past. There can be no doubt that
    when the position of the majority is presented in this way it
    seems rather ridiculous. But this is very far from the truth. The
    majority rejected these attempts because they would be wrong. They
    would not correspond to the real state of affairs. Pure
    imperialism, without the fundamental basis of capitalism, has
    never existed, does not exist anywhere, and never will exist. This
    is an incorrect generalisation of everything that was said of the
    syndicates, cartels, trusts and finance capitalism, when finance
    capitalism was depicted as though it had none of the foundations
    of the old capitalism under it.</p> 

    <p>That is wrong. It would be particularly wrong for the era of
    the imperialist war and for the era following the imperialist
    war. Engels in his time, in one of his reflections on the future
    war, wrote that it would involve much more severe devastation than
    that caused by the Thirty Years&#8217; War; that in a large degree
    mankind would be reduced to savagery, that our artificial
    apparatus of trade and industry would collapse.<a id="bk10"
    href="#fw10" name="bk10"><sup class="enote">[10]</sup></a> At the
    beginning of the war the traitor socialists and opportunists
    boasted of the tenacity of capitalism and derided the
    &#8220;fanatics or semi-anarchists&#8221;, as they called
    us. &#8220;Look,&#8221; they said, &#8220;these predictions have
    not come true. Events have shown that they were true only of a
    very small number of countries and for a very short period of
    time!&#8221; And now, not only in Russia and not only in Germany,
    but even in the victor countries, a gigantic collapse of modern
    capitalism is beginning, a collapse, so gigantic that it
    frequently removes this artificial apparatus and restores the old
    capitalism.</p> 

    <p><sup class="enote">When Comrade Bukharin stated that an attempt
    might be made to present an integral picture of the collapse of
    capitalism and imperialism, we objected to it in the commission,
    and I must object to it here. Just try it, and you will see that
    you will not succeed. Comrade Bukharin made one such attempt in
    the commission, and himself gave it up. I am absolutely convinced
    that if anybody could do this, it is Comrade Bukharin, who has
    studied this question very extensively and thoroughly. I assert
    that such an attempt cannot be successful, because the task is a
    wrong one. We in Russia are now experiencing the consequences of
    the imperialist war and the beginning of the dictatorship of the
    proletariat. At the same time, in a number of the regions of
    Russia, cut off from each other more than formerly, we frequently
    see a regeneration of capitalism and the development of its early
    stage. That is something we cannot escape. If the programme were
    to be written in the way Comrade Bukharin wanted, it would be a
    wrong programme. At best, it would be a reproduction of all the
    best that has been said of finance capitalism and imperialism, but
    it would not reproduce reality, precisely because this reality is
    not integral. A programme made up of heterogeneous parts is
    inelegant (but that, of course, is not important), but any other
    programme would simply be incorrect. However unpleasant it may be,
    whatever it may lack in proportion, we shall be unable for a long
    time to escape this heterogeneity, this necessity of constructing
    from different materials. When we do escape it, we shall create
    another programme. But then we shall already be living in a
    socialist society. It would be ridiculous to pretend that things
    will be then what they are now.</sup></p> 

    <p><sup class="enote">We are living at a time when a number of the
    most elementary and fundamental manifestations of capitalism have
    been revived. Take, for instance, the collapse of transport, which
    we are experiencing so well, or rather so badly, in our own
    case. This same thing is taking place in other countries, too,
    even in the victor countries. And what does the collapse of
    transport mean under the imperialist system? A return to the most
    primitive forms of commodity production. We know very well what
    our profiteers or bagmen are. This latter word, I think, has up to
    now been unknown to foreigners. And now? Speak to the comrades who
    have arrived for the Congress of the Third International. It turns
    out that similar words are beginning to appear in both Germany and
    Switzerland. And this is a category you cannot fit into any
    dictatorship of the proletariat; you have to return to the very
    dawn of capitalist society and commodity production.</sup></p> 

    <p><sup class="enote">To escape from this sad reality by creating
    a smooth and integral programme is to escape into something
    ethereal that is not of this world, to write a wrong
    programme. And it is by no means reverence for the past, as
    Comrade Bukharin politely hinted, which induced us here to insert
    passages from the old programme. What appeared to be implied was
    this: the programme was written in 1903 with the participation of
    Lenin; the programme is undoubtedly a bad one; but since old
    people love most of all to recall the past, in a new era a new
    programme has been drawn up which, out of reverence for the past,
    repeats the old programme. If it were so, such cranks ought to be
    laughed at. I assert that it is not so. The capitalism described
    in 1903 remains in existence in 1919 in the Soviet proletarian
    republic just because of the disintegration of imperialism,
    because of its collapse. Capitalism of this kind can be found, for
    instance, in Samara and in Vyatka gubernias, which are not very
    far from Moscow. In a period when civil war is rending the
    country, we shall not soon emerge from this situation, from this
    profiteering. That is why any other structure of the programme
    would be incorrect. We must state what actually exists; the
    programme must contain what is absolutely irrefutable, what has
    been established in fact. Only then will it be a Marxist
    programme.</sup></p> 

    <p><sup class="enote">Theoretically, Comrade Bukharin understands
    this perfectly and says that the programme must be concrete. But
    it is one thing to understand and another to act upon this
    understanding. Comrade Bukharin&#8217;s concreteness is a bookish
    description of finance capitalism. In reality we have
    heterogeneous phenomena to deal with. In every agricultural
    gubernia there is free competition side by side with monopoly
    industry. Nowhere in the world has monopoly capitalism existed in
    a whole series of branches without free competition, nor will it
    exist. To write of such a system is to write of a system which is
    false and removed from reality. If Marx said of manufacture that
    it was a superstructure on mass small production,<a id="bk11"
    href="#fw11" name="bk11"><sup class="enote">[11]</sup></a>
    imperialism and finance capitalism are a superstructure on the old
    capitalism. If its top is destroyed, the old capitalism is
    exposed. To maintain that there is such a thing as integral
    imperialism without the old capitalism is merely making the wish
    father to the thought.</sup></p> 

    <p>This is a natural mistake, one very easily committed. And if we
    had an integral imperialism before us, which had entirely altered
    capitalism, our task would have been a hundred thousand times
    easier. It would have resulted in a system in which everything
    would be subordinated to finance capital alone. It would then only
    have remained to remove the top and to transfer what remained to
    the proletariat. That would have been extremely agreeable, but it
    is not so in reality. In reality the development is such that we
    have to act in an entirely different way. <em>Imperialism is a
    superstructure on capitalism.</em> When it collapses, we find
    ourselves dealing with the destruction of the top and the exposure
    of the foundation. That is why our programme, if it is to be a
    correct one, must state what actually exists. There is the old
    capitalism, which in a number of branches has grown to
    imperialism. Its tendencies are exclusively
    imperialist. Fundamental questions can be examined only from the
    point of view of imperialism. There is not a single major question
    of home or foreign policy which could be settled in any way except
    from the point of view of this tendency. This is not what the
    programme now speaks about. In reality, there exists a vast
    subsoil of the old capitalism. There is the superstructure of
    imperialism, which led to the war, and from this war followed the
    beginnings of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a phase
    you cannot escape. This fact is characteristic of the very rate of
    development of the proletarian revolution throughout the world,
    and will remain a fact for many years to come.</p> 

    <p>West-European revolutions will perhaps proceed more smoothly;
    nevertheless, very many years will be required for the
    reorganisation of the whole world, for the reorganisation of the
    majority of the countries. And this means that during the present
    transition period, we cannot escape this mosaic reality. We cannot
    cast aside this patchwork reality, however inelegant it may be; we
    cannot cast away one bit of it. If the programme were drawn up
    otherwise than it has been drawn up, it would be a wrong
    programme.</p> 

    <p>We say that we have arrived at the dictatorship. But we must
    know <em>how</em> we arrived at it. The past keeps fast hold of
    us, grasps us with a thousand tentacles, and does not allow us to
    take a single forward step, or compels us to take these steps
    badly in the way we are taking them. And we say that for the
    situation we are arriving at to be understood, it must be stated
    how we proceeded and what led us to the socialist revolution. We
    were led to it by imperialism, by capitalism in its early
    commodity production forms. All this must be understood, because
    it is only by reckoning with reality that we can solve such
    problems as, let us say, our attitude towards the middle
    peasants. And how is it, indeed, that there is such a category as
    a middle peasant in the era of purely imperialist capitalism? It
    did not exist even in countries that were simply capitalist. If we
    are to solve the problem of our attitude towards this almost
    medieval phenomenon (the middle peasants) purely from the point of
    view of imperialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, we
    shall be absolutely unable to make ends meet, and we shall land in
    many difficulties. But if we are to change our attitude towards
    the middle peasant&#8212;then also have the goodness to say in the
    theoretical part where he came from and what he is. He is a small
    commodity producer. And this is the ABC of capitalism, of which we
    must speak, because we have not yet grown out of it. To brush this
    aside and say, &#8220;Why should we study the ABC when we have
    studied finance capitalism?&#8221; would be highly frivolous.</p> 

    <p>I have to say the same thing about the <em>national
    question.</em> Here too the wish is father to the thought with
    Comrade Bukharin. He says that we must not recognise the right of
    nations to self-determination. A nation means the bourgeoisie
    together with the proletariat. And are we, the proletarians, to
    recognise the right to self-determination of the despised
    bourgeoisie? That is absolutely incompatible! Pardon me, it is
    compatible with what actually exists. If you eliminate this, the
    result will be sheer fantasy. You refer to the process of
    differentiation which is taking place within the nations, the
    process of separation of the proletariat from the bourgeoisie. But
    let us see how this differentiation will proceed.</p> 

    <p>Take, for instance, Germany, the model of an advanced
    capitalist country whose organisation of capitalism, finance
    capitalism, was superior to that of America. She was inferior in
    many other respects, in technical development and production and
    in the political sphere, but in respect of the organisation of
    finance capitalism, in respect of the transformation of monopoly
    capitalism into state monopoly capitalism, Germany was superior to
    America. She is a model, it would seem. But what is taking place
    there? Has the German proletariat become differentiated from the
    bourgeoisie? No! It was reported that the majority of the workers
    are opposed to Scheidemann in only a few of the large towns. But
    how did this come about? It was owing to the alliance between the
    Spartacists and the thrice-accursed German Menshevik-Independents,
    who make a muddle of everything and want to wed the system of
    workers&#8217; councils to a Constituent Assembly! And this is
    what is taking place in that very Germany! And she, mark you, is
    an advanced country.</p> 

    <p>Comrade Bukharin says, &#8220;Why do we need the right of
    nations to self-determination?&#8221; I must repeat what I said
    opposing him in the summer of 1917, when he proposed to delete the
    minimum programme and to leave only the maximum programme.<a
    id="bk12" href="#fw12" name="bk12"><sup
    class="enote">[12]</sup></a> I then retorted, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
    halloo until you&#8217;re out of the wood.&#8221; When we have
    conquered power, and even then only after waiting a while, we
    shall do this.<a id="bk13" href="#fw13" name="bk13"><sup
    class="enote">[13]</sup></a> We have conquered power, we have
    waited a while, and now I am willing to do it. We have gone
    directly into socialist construction, we have beaten off the first
    assault that threatened us&#8212;now it will be in place. The same
    applies to the right of nations to self-determination. &#8220;I
    want to recognise only the right of the working classes to
    self-determination,&#8221; says Comrade Bukharin. That is to say,
    you want to recognise something that has not been achieved in a
    single country except Russia. That is ridiculous.</p> 

    <p>Look at Finland; she is a democratic country, more developed,
    more cultured than we are. In Finland a process of separation, of
    the differentiation of the proletariat is taking a specific
    course, far more painful than was the case with us. The Finns have
    experienced the dictatorship of Germany; they are now experiencing
    the dictatorship of the Allied powers. But thanks to the fact that
    we have recognised the right of nations to self-determination, the
    process of differentiation has been facilitated there. I very well
    recall the scene when, at Smolny, I handed the act to Svinhufvud<a
    id="bk14" href="#fw14" name="bk14"><sup
    class="enote">[14]</sup></a> which in Russian means
    &#8220;pighead&#8221;&#8212;the representative of the Finnish
    bourgeoisie, who played the part of a hangman. He amiably shook my
    hand, we exchanged compliments. How unpleasant that was! But it
    had to be done, because at that time the bourgeoisie were
    deceiving the people, were deceiving the working people by
    alleging that the Muscovites, the chauvinists, the Great Russians,
    wanted to crush the Finns. It had to be done.</p> 

    <p>Yesterday, was it not necessary to do the same thing in
    relation to the Bashkirian Republic?<a id="bk15" href="#fw15"
    name="bk15"><sup class="enote">[15]</sup></a> When Comrade
    Bukharin said, &#8220;We can recognise this right in some
    cases&#8221;, I even wrote down that he had included in the list
    the Hottentots, the Bushmen and the Indians. Hearing this
    enumeration, I thought, how is it that Comrade Bukharin has
    forgotten a small tribe, the Bashkirs? There are no Bushmen in
    Russia, nor have I heard that the Hottentots have laid claim to an
    autonomous republic, but we have Bashkirs, Kirghiz and a number of
    other peoples, and to these we cannot deny recognition. We cannot
    deny it to a single one of the peoples living within the
    boundaries of the former Russian Empire. Let us even assume that
    the Bashkirs have overthrown the exploiters and we have helped
    them to do so. This is possible only when a revolution has fully
    matured, and it must be done cautiously, so as not to retard by
    one&#8217;s interference that very process of the differentiation
    of the proletariat which we ought to expedite. What, then, can we
    do in relation to such peoples as the Kirghiz, the Uzbeks, the
    Tajiks, the Turkmen, who to this day are under the influence of
    their mullahs? Here, in Russia, the population, having had a long
    experience of the priests, helped us to overthrow them. But you
    know how badly the decree on civil marriage is still being put
    into effect. Can we approach these peoples and tell them that we
    shall overthrow their exploiters? We cannot do this, because they
    are entirely subordinated to their mullahs. In such cases we have
    to wait until the given nation develops, until the differentiation
    of the proletariat from the bourgeois elements, which is
    inevitable, has taken place.</p> 

    <p>Comrade Bukharin does not want to wait. He is possessed by
    impatience: &#8220;Why should we? When we have ourselves
    overthrown the bourgeoisie, proclaimed Soviet power and the
    dictatorship of the proletariat, why should we act thus?&#8221;
    This has the effect of a rousing appeal, it contains an indication
    of our path, but if we were to proclaim only this in our
    programme, it would not be a programme, but a proclamation. We may
    proclaim Soviet power, and the dictatorship of the proletariat,
    and express the contempt for the bourgeoisie they deserve a
    thousand times over, but in the programme we must write just what
    actually exists with the greatest precision. And then our
    programme will be incontrovertible.</p> 

    <p>We hold a strictly class standpoint. What we are writing in the
    programme is a recognition of what has actually taken place since
    the time we wrote of the self-determination of nations in
    general. At that time there were still no proletarian
    republics. It was when they appeared, and only as they appeared,
    that we were able to write what is written here: &#8220;A
    federation of states organised after the <em>Soviet
    type.</em>&#8221; The Soviet type is not yet Soviets as they exist
    in Russia, but the Soviet type is becoming international. And this
    is all we can say. To go farther, one step farther, one
    hair&#8217;s breadth farther, would be wrong, and therefore
    unsuitable for a programme.</p> 

    <p>We say that account must be taken of the stage reached by the
    given nation on its way from medievalism to bourgeois democracy,
    and from bourgeois democracy to proletarian democracy. That is
    absolutely correct. All nations have the right to
    self-determination&#8212;there is no need to speak specially of
    the Hottentots and the Bushmen. The vast majority, most likely
    nine-tenths of the population of the earth, perhaps 95 per cent,
    come under this description, since all countries are on the way
    from medievalism to bourgeois democracy or from bourgeois
    democracy to proletarian democracy. This is an absolutely
    inevitable course. More cannot be said, because it would be wrong,
    because it would not be what actually exists. To reject the
    self-determination of nations and insert the self-determination of
    the working people would be absolutely wrong, because this manner
    of settling the question does not reckon with the difficulties,
    with the zigzag course taken by differentiation within nations. In
    Germany it is not proceeding in the same way as in our
    country&#8212;in certain respects more rapidly, and in other
    respects in a slower and more sanguinary way. Not a single party
    in our country accepted so monstrous an idea as a combination of
    workers&#8217; councils and a Constituent Assembly. And yet we
    have to live side by side with these nations. Now
    Scheidemann&#8217;s party is already saying that we want to
    conquer Germany. That is of course ridiculous, nonsensical. But
    the bourgeoisie have their own interests and their own press,
    which is shouting this to the whole world in hundreds of millions
    of copies; Wilson, too, is supporting this in his own
    interests. The Bolsheviks, they declare, have a large army, and
    they want, by means of conquest, to implant their Bolshevism in
    Germany. The best people in Germany&#8212;the
    Spartacists&#8212;told us that the German workers are being
    incited against the Communists; look, they are told, how bad
    things are with the Bolsheviks! And we cannot say that things with
    us are very good. And so our enemies in Germany influence the
    people with the argument that the proletarian revolution in
    Germany would result in the same disorders as in Russia. Our
    disorders are a protracted illness. We are contending with
    desperate difficulties in creating the proletarian dictatorship in
    our country. As long as the bourgeoisie, or the petty bourgeoisie,
    or even part of the German workers, are under the influence of
    this bug bear&#8212;&#8220;the Bolsheviks want to establish their
    system by force&#8221;&#8212;so long will the formula &#8220;the
    self-determination of the working people&#8221; not help
    matters. We must arrange things so that the German
    traitor-socialists will not be able to say that the Bolsheviks are
    trying to impose their universal system, which, as it were, can be
    brought into Berlin on Red Army bayonets. And this is what may
    happen if the principle of the self-determination of nations is
    denied.</p> 

    <p>Our programme must not speak of the self-determination of the
    working people, because that would be wrong. It must speak of what
    actually exists. Since nations are at different stages on the road
    from medievalism to bourgeois democracy and from bourgeois
    democracy to proletarian democracy, this thesis of our programme
    is absolutely correct. With us there have been very many zigzags
    on this road. Every nation must obtain the right to
    self-determination, and that will make the self-determination of
    the working people easier. In Finland the process of separation of
    the proletariat from the bourgeoisie is remarkably clear, forceful
    and deep. At any rate, things will not proceed there as they do in
    our country. If we were to declare that we do not recognise any
    Finnish nation, but only the working people, that would be sheer
    nonsense. We cannot refuse to recognise what actually exists; it
    will itself compel us to recognise it. The demarcation between the
    proletariat and the bourgeoisie is proceeding in different
    countries in their own specific ways. Here we must act with utmost
    caution. We must be particularly cautious with regard to the
    various nations, for there is nothing worse than lack of
    confidence on the part of a nation. Self-determination of the
    proletariat is proceeding among the Poles. Here are the latest
    figures on the composition of the Warsaw Soviet of Workers&#8217;
    Deputies. <a id="bk16" href="#fw16" name="bk16"><sup
    class="enote">[16]</sup></a> Polish traitor-socialists&#8212;333,
    Communists&#8212;297. This shows that, according to our
    revolutionary calendar, October in that country is not very far
    off. It is somewhere about August or September 1917. But, firstly,
    no decree has yet been issued stating that all countries must live
    according to the Bolshevik revolutionary calendar; and even if it
    were issued, it would not be observed. And, secondly, the
    situation at present is such that the majority of the Polish
    workers, who are more advanced than ours and more cultured, share
    the standpoint of social-defencism, social-patriotism. We must
    wait. We cannot speak here of the self-determination of the
    working people. We must carry on propaganda in behalf of this
    differentiation. This is what we are doing, but there is not the
    slightest shadow of doubt that we must recognise the
    self-determination of the Polish nation now. That is clear. The
    Polish proletarian movement is taking the same course as ours,
    towards the dictatorship of the proletariat, but not in the same
    way as in Russia. And there the workers are being intimidated by
    statements to the effect that the Muscovites, the Great Russians,
    who have always oppressed the Poles, want to carry their
    Great-Russian chauvinism into Poland in the guise of
    communism. Communism cannot be imposed by force. When I said to
    one of the best comrades among the Polish Communists, &#8220;You
    will do it in a different way&#8221;, he replied, &#8220;No, we
    shall do the same thing, but better than you.&#8221; To such an
    argument I had absolutely no objections. They must be given the
    opportunity of fulfilling a modest wish&#8212;to create a better
    Soviet power than ours. We cannot help reckoning with the fact
    that things there are proceeding in rather a peculiar way, and we
    cannot say: &#8220;Down with the right of nations to
    self-determination! We grant the right of self-determination only
    to the working people.&#8221; This self-determination proceeds in
    a very complex and difficult way. It exists nowhere but in Russia,
    and, while foreseeing every stage of development in other
    countries, we must decree nothing from Moscow. That is why this
    proposal is unacceptable in principle.</p> 

    <p>I now pass to the other points which I am to deal with in
    accordance with the plan we have drawn up. I have given the first
    place to the question of <em>small proprietors and middle
    peasants.</em> In this respect, Clause 47 states:</p> <p
    class="quote">&#8220;With regard to the middle peasants, the
    policy of the Russian Communist Party is to draw them into the
    work of socialist construction gradually and systematically. The
    Party sets itself the task of separating them from the kulaks, of
    winning them to the side of the working class by carefully
    attending to their needs, by combating their backwardness with
    ideological weapons and under no circumstances with measures of
    suppression, and by striving in all cases where their vital
    interests are concerned to come to practical agreements with them,
    making concessions to them in determining the methods of carrying
    out socialist reforms.&#8221;</p> 

    <p>It seems to me that here we are formulating what the founders
    of socialism have frequently said regarding the middle
    peasants. The only defect of this clause is that it is not
    sufficiently concrete. We could hardly give more in a programme
    But it is not only questions of programme we must discuss at the
    Congress, and we must give profound, thrice profound consideration
    to the question of the middle peasants. We have information to the
    effect that in the revolts which have occurred in some places, a
    <em>general plan</em> is clearly discernible, and that this plan
    is obviously connected with the military plan of the whiteguards,
    who have decided on a general offensive in March and on the
    organisation of a number of revolts. In the presidium of the
    Congress there is a draft of an appeal in the name of the
    Congress, which will be reported to you. <a id="bk17" href="#fw17"
    name="bk17"><sup class="enote">[17]</sup></a> These revolts show
    as clear as can be that the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and a
    part of the Mensheviks&#8212;in Bryansk it was the Mensheviks who
    worked to provoke the revolt&#8212;are acting as actual agents of
    the whiteguards. A general offensive of the whiteguards, revolts
    in the villages, the interruption of railway traffic&#8212;perhaps
    it will be possible to overthrow the Bolsheviks in this way? Here
    the role of the middle peasants stands out especially clearly,
    forcibly and insistently. At the Congress we must not only lay
    particular stress on our accommodating attitude towards the middle
    peasants, but also think over a number of measures, as concrete as
    possible, which will directly give at least something to the
    middle peasants. These measures are absolutely essential for
    self-preservation and for the struggle against all our enemies;
    they know that the middle peasant vacillates between us and them
    and they are endeavouring to win him away from us. Our position is
    now such that we possess vast reserves. We know that both the
    Polish and the Hungarian revolutions are growing, and very
    rapidly. These revolutions will furnish us with proletarian
    reserves, will ease our situation and will to a very large ex-
    tent reinforce our proletarian base, which is weak. This may
    happen in the next few months, but we do not know just when. You
    know that an acute moment has now come and therefore the question
    of the middle peasants now assumes tremendous practical
    importance.</p> 

    <p>Further, I should like to dwell on the question of
    <em>co-operation</em>&#8212;that is Clause 48 of our programme. To
    a certain extent this clause has become obsolete. When we were
    drafting it in the commission, co-operatives existed in our
    country, but there were no consumers&#8217; communes; a few days
    later, however, the decree on the merging of all forms of
    co-operatives into a single consumers&#8217; commune was issued. I
    do not know whether this decree has been published and whether the
    majority of those here present are acquainted with it. If not, it
    will be published tomorrow or the day after. In this respect, this
    clause is already out of date, but it nevertheless appears to me
    that it is necessary, for we all know very well that it is a
    pretty long way from decrees to fulfilment. We have been toiling
    and moiling over the co-operatives since April 1918, and although
    we have achieved considerable success, it is not yet a decisive
    success. We have at times succeeded in organising the population
    in the co-operatives to such an extent that in many of the uyezds
    98 per cent of the rural population are already so organised. But
    these co-operatives, which existed in capitalist society, are
    saturated with the spirit of bourgeois society, and are headed by
    Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, by bourgeois experts. We
    have not yet been able to establish our authority over them, and
    here our task remains unaccomplished. Our decree is a step forward
    in that it creates consumers&#8217; communes; it orders that all
    forms of co-operation all over Russia shall be merged. But this
    decree, too, even if we carry it into effect entirely, leaves the
    autonomous sections of workers&#8217; co-operatives within the
    future consumers&#8217; communes, because representatives of the
    workers&#8217; co-operatives who have a practical knowledge of the
    matter told us, and proved it, that the workers&#8217;
    co-operatives, as a more highly developed organisation, should be
    preserved, since their operations are essential. There were quite
    a few differences and disputes within our Party over the question
    of co-operation; there was friction between the Bolsheviks in the
    co-operatives and the Bolsheviks in the Soviets. In principle, it
    seems to me that the question should undoubtedly be settled in the
    sense that this apparatus, the only one for which capitalism paved
    the way among the people, the only one operating among a rural
    population still at the level of primitive capitalism, must be
    preserved at all costs; it must be developed and must not, under
    any circumstances be discarded. The task here is a difficult one
    because in the majority of cases the leaders of the co-operatives
    are bourgeois specialists, very frequently real whiteguards. Hence
    the hatred for them, a legitimate hatred, hence the fight against
    them. But it must, of course, be conducted skilfully: <em>we must
    put a stop to the counter-revolutionary attempts of the
    co-operators</em>, <em>but this must not be a struggle against the
    apparatus of the co-operatives.</em> While getting rid of the
    counter-revolutionary leaders, we must establish our authority
    over the apparatus itself. Here our aim is exactly the same as it
    is in the case of the bourgeois experts, which is another question
    I should like to refer to.</p> 

    <p>The question of the <em>bourgeois experts</em> is provoking
    quite a lot of friction and divergences of opinion. When I
    recently had occasion to speak to the Petrograd Soviet, among the
    written questions submitted to me there were several devoted to
    the question of rates of pay. I was asked whether it is
    permissible in a socialist republic to pay as much as 3,000
    rubles. We have, in fact, included this question in the programme,
    because dissatisfaction on these grounds has gone rather far. The
    question of the bourgeois experts has arisen in the army, in
    industry, in the co-operatives, everywhere. It is a very important
    question of the period of transition from capitalism to
    communism. We shall be able to build up communism only when, with
    the means provided by bourgeois science and technology, we make it
    more accessible to the people. There is no other way of building a
    communist society. But in order to build it in this way, we must
    take the apparatus from the bourgeoisie, we must enlist all these
    experts in the work. We have intentionally explained this question
    in detail in the programme in order to have it settled
    radically. We are perfectly aware of the effects of Russia&#8217;s
    cultural underdevelopment, of what it is doing to Soviet
    power&#8212;which in principle has provided an immensely higher
    proletarian democracy, which has created a model of such democracy
    for the whole world&#8212;how this lack of culture is reducing the
    significance of Soviet power and reviving bureaucracy. The Soviet
    apparatus is accessible to all the working people in word, but
    actually it is far from being accessible to all of them, as we all
    know. And not because the laws prevent it from being so, as was
    the case under the bourgeoisie; on the contrary, our laws assist
    in this respect. But in this matter laws alone are not enough. A
    vast amount of educational, organisational and cultural work is
    required; this cannot be done rapidly by legislation but demands a
    vast amount of work over a long period. This question of the
    bourgeois experts must be settled quite definitely at this
    Congress. The settlement of the question will enable the comrades,
    who are undoubtedly following this Congress attentively, to lean
    on its authority and to realise what difficulties we are up
    against. It will help those comrades who come up against this
    question at every step to take part at least in propaganda
    work.</p> 

    <p>The comrades here in Moscow who are representing the
    Spartacists at the Congress told us that in western Germany, where
    industry is most developed, and where the influence of the
    Spartacists among the workers is greatest, engineers and managers
    in very many of the large enterprises would come to the
    Spartacists, although the Spartacists have not yet been victorious
    there, and say, &#8220;We shall go with you.&#8221; That was not
    the case in our country. Evidently, there the higher cultural
    level of the workers, the greater proletarianisation of the
    engineering personnel, and perhaps a number of other causes of
    which we do not know, have created relations which differ somewhat
    from ours.</p> 

    <p>At any rate, here we have one of the chief obstacles to further
    progress. We must immediately, without waiting for the support of
    other countries, immediately, at this very moment develop our
    productive forces. We cannot do this without the bourgeois
    experts. That must be said once and for all. Of course, the
    majority of these experts have a thoroughly bourgeois
    outlook. They must be placed in an environment of comradely
    collaboration, of worker commissars and of communist nuclei; they
    must be so placed that they cannot break out; but they must be
    given the opportu- nity of working in better conditions than they
    did under capitalism, since this group of people, which has been
    trained by the bourgeoisie, will not work otherwise. To compel a
    whole section of the population to work under coercion is
    impossible&#8212;that we know very well from experience. We can
    compel them not to take an active part in counter-revolution, we
    can intimidate them so as to make them dread to respond to the
    appeals of the whiteguards. In this respect the Bolsheviks act
    energetically. This can be done, and this we are doing
    adequately. This we have all learned to do. But it is impossible
    in this way to compel a whole section to work. These people are
    accustomed to do cultural work, they advanced it within the
    framework of the bourgeois system, that is, they enriched the
    bourgeoisie with tremendous material acquisitions, but gave them
    to the proletariat in infinitesimal doses&#8212;nevertheless they
    did advance culture, that was their job. As they see the working
    class promoting organised and advanced sections, which not only
    value culture but also help to convey it to the people, they are
    changing their attitude towards us. When a doctor sees that the
    proletariat is arousing the working people to independent activity
    in fighting epidemics, his attitude towards us completely
    changes. We have a large section of such bourgeois doctors,
    engineers, agronomists and co-operators, and when they see in
    practice that the proletariat is enlisting more and more people to
    this cause, they will be conquered <em>morally</em>, and not
    merely be cut off from the bourgeoisie politically. Our task will
    then become easier. They will then of themselves be drawn into our
    apparatus and become part of it. To achieve this, sacrifices are
    necessary. To pay even two thousand million for this is a
    trifle. To fear this sacrifice would be childish, for it would
    mean that we do not comprehend the tasks before us.</p> 

    <p>The chaos in our transport, the chaos in industry and
    agriculture are undermining the very life of the Soviet
    Republic. Here we must resort to the most energetic measures,
    straining every nerve of the country to the utmost. We must not
    practise a policy of petty pinpricks with regard to the
    experts. These experts are not the servitors of the exploiters,
    they are active cultural workers, who in bourgeois society served
    the bourgeoisie, and of whom all socialists all over the world
    said that in a proletarian society they would serve <em>us.</em>
    In this transition period we must accord them the best possible
    conditions of life. That will be the best policy. That will be the
    most economical management. Otherwise, while saving a few hundred
    millions, we may lose so much that no sum will be sufficient to
    restore what we have lost.</p> 

    <p>When we discussed the question of rates of pay with the
    Commissar for Labour, Schmidt, he mentioned facts like these. He
    said that in the matter of equalising wages we have done more than
    any bourgeois state has done anywhere, or can do in scores of
    years. Take the pre-war rates of pay: a manual labourer used to
    get one ruble a day, twenty-five rubles a month, while an expert
    got five hundred rubles a month, not counting those who were paid
    hundreds of thousands of rubles. The expert used to receive twenty
    times more than the worker. Our present rates of pay vary from six
    hundred rubles to three thousand rubles&#8212;only five times
    more. We have done a great deal towards equalising the rates. Of
    course, we are now overpaying experts, but to pay them a little
    more for giving us their knowledge is not only worth while, but
    necessary and theoretically indispensable. In my opinion, this
    question is dealt with in sufficient detail in the programme. It
    must be particularly stressed. Not only must it be settled here in
    principle, but we must see to it that every delegate to the
    Congress, on returning to his locality, should, in his report to
    his organisation and in all his activities, secure its
    execution.</p> 

    <p>We have already succeeded in bringing about a thorough change
    of attitude among the vacillating intellectuals. Yesterday we were
    talking about legalising the petty-bourgeois parties, but today we
    are arresting the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries; by
    this switching back and forth we are applying a very definite
    system. A consistent and very firm line runs through these changes
    of policy, namely, <em>to cut off counter-revolution and to
    utilise the cultural apparatus of the bourgeoisie.</em> The
    Mensheviks are the worst enemies of socialism, because they clothe
    themselves in a proletarian disguise; but the Mensheviks are a
    non-proletarian group. In this group there is only an
    insignificant proletarian upper layer, while the group itself
    consists of petty intellectuals. This group is coming over to our
    side. We shall take it over wholly, as a group. Every time they
    come to us, we say, &#8220;Welcome!&#8221; With every one of these
    vacillations, part of them come over to us. This was the case with
    the Mensheviks and the <em>Novaya Zhizn</em> people and with the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries; this will be the case with all these
    vacillators, who will long continue to get in our way, whine and
    desert one camp for the other&#8212;you cannot do anything with
    them. But through all these vacillations we shall be enlisting
    groups of cultured intellectuals into the ranks of Soviet workers,
    and we shall cut off those elements that continue to support the
    whiteguards.</p> 

    <p>The next question which, according to the division of subjects,
    falls to my share is the <em>question of bureaucracy and of
    enlisting the broad mass of the people in Soviet work.</em> We
    have been hearing complaints about bureaucracy for a long time;
    the complaints are undoubtedly well founded. We have done what no
    other state in the world has done in the fight against
    bureaucracy. The apparatus which was a thoroughly bureaucratic and
    bourgeois apparatus of oppression, and which remains such even in
    the freest of bourgeois republics, we have destroyed to its very
    foundations. Take, for example, the courts. Here, it is true, the
    task was easier; we did not have to create a new apparatus,
    because anybody can act as a judge basing himself on the
    revolutionary sense of justice of the working classes. We have
    still by no means completed the work in this field but in a number
    of respects we have made the courts what they should be. We have
    created bodies on which not only men, but also women, the most
    backward and conservative section of the population, can be made
    to serve without exception.</p> 

    <p>The employees in the other spheres of government are more
    hardened bureaucrats. The task here is more difficult. We cannot
    live without this apparatus; every branch of government creates a
    demand for such an apparatus. Here we are suffering from the fact
    that Russia was not sufficiently developed as a capitalist
    country. Germany, apparently, will suffer less from this, because
    her bureaucratic apparatus passed through an extensive school,
    which sucks people dry but compels them to work and not just wear
    out armchairs, as happens in our offices. We dispersed these old
    bureaucrats, shuffled them and then began to place them in new
    posts. The tsarist bureaucrats began to join the Soviet
    institutions and practise their bureaucratic methods, they began
    to assume the colouring of Communists and, to succeed better in
    their careers, to procure membership cards of the Russian
    Communist Party. And so, they have been thrown out of the door but
    they creep back in through the window. What makes itself felt here
    most is the lack of cultured forces. These bureaucrats may be
    dismissed, but they cannot be re-educated all at once. Here we are
    confronted chiefly with organisational, cultural and educational
    problems.</p> 

    <p>We can fight bureaucracy to the bitter end, to a complete
    victory, only when the whole population participates in the work
    of government. In the bourgeois republics not only is this
    impossible, <em>but the law itself prevents it.</em> The best of
    the bourgeois republics, no matter how democratic they may be,
    have thousands of legal hindrances which prevent the working
    people from participating in the work of government. What we have
    done, was to remove these hindrances, but so far we have not
    reached the stage at which the working people could participate in
    government. Apart from the law, there is still the level of
    culture, which you cannot subject to any law. The result of this
    low cultural level is that the Soviets, which by virtue of their
    programme are organs of government <em>by the working people</em>,
    are in fact organs of government <em>for the working people</em>
    by the advanced section of the proletariat, but not by the working
    people as a whole.</p> 

    <p>Here we are confronted by a problem which cannot be solved
    except by prolonged education. At present this task is an
    inordinately difficult one for us, because, as I have had frequent
    occasion to say, the section of workers who are governing is
    inordinately, incredibly <em>small.</em> We must secure
    help. According to all indications, such a reserve is growing up
    within the country. There cannot be the slightest doubt of the
    existence of a tremendous thirst for knowledge and of tremendous
    progress in education&#8212;mostly attained outside the
    schools&#8212;of tremendous progress in educating the working
    people. This progress cannot be confined within any school
    framework, but it is tremendous. All indications go to show that
    we shall obtain a vast reserve in the near future, which will
    replace the representatives of the small section of proletarians
    who have overstrained themselves in the work. But, in any case,
    our present situation in this respect is extremely
    difficult. Bureaucracy has been defeated. The exploiters have been
    eliminated. But the cultural level has not been raised, and
    therefore the bureaucrats are occupying their old positions. They
    can be forced to retreat only if the proletariat and the peasants
    are organised far more extensively than has been the case up to
    now, and only if real measures are taken to enlist the workers in
    government. You are all aware of such measures in the case of
    every People&#8217;s Commissariat, and I shall not dwell on
    them.</p> 

    <p>The last point I have to deal with is the question of <em>the
    leading role of the proletariat and disfranchisement.</em> Our
    Constitution recognises the precedence of the proletariat in
    respect of the peasants and disfranchises the exploiters. It was
    this that the pure democrats of Western Europe attacked most. We
    answered, and are answering, that they have forgotten the most
    fundamental propositions of Marxism, they have forgotten that with
    them it is a case of bourgeois democracy, whereas we have passed
    to <em>proletarian</em> democracy. There is not a single country
    in the world which has done even one-tenth of what the Soviet
    Republic has done in the past few months for the workers and the
    poor peasants in enlisting them in the work of administering the
    state. That is an absolute truth. Nobody will deny that in the
    matter of true, not paper, democracy, in the matter of enlisting
    the workers and peasants, we have done more than has been done or
    could be done by the best of the democratic republics in hundreds
    of years. It was this that determined the significance of the
    Soviets, it was owing to this that the Soviets have become a
    slogan for the proletariat of all countries.</p> 

    <p>But this in no way saves us from stumbling over the inadequate
    culture of the people. We do not at all regard the question of
    disfranchising the bourgeoisie from an absolute point of view,
    because it is theoretically quite conceivable that the
    dictatorship of the proletariat may suppress the bourgeoisie at
    every step without disfranchising them. This is theoretically
    quite conceivable. Nor do we propose our Constitution as a model
    for other countries. All we say is that whoever conceives the
    transition to socialism with out the suppression of the
    bourgeoisie is not a socialist. But while it is essential to
    suppress the bourgeoisie as a class, it is not essential to
    deprive them of suffrage and of equality. We do not want freedom
    for the bourgeoisie, we do not recognise equality of exploiters
    and exploited, but this question is so handled in the programme
    that the Constitution does not prescribe such measures as the
    inequality of workers and peasants. They were embodied in the
    Constitution <em>after</em> they were already in actual
    practice. It was not even the Bolsheviks who drew up the
    Constitution of the Soviets; it was drawn up to their own
    detriment by the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries
    before the Bolshevik revolution. They drew it up in accordance
    with the conditions actually obtaining. The organisation of the
    proletariat proceeded much more rapidly than the organisation of
    the peasants, which fact made the workers the bulwark of the
    revolution and gave them a virtual advantage. The next task is
    gradually to pass from these advantages to their
    equalisation. Nobody drove the bourgeoisie out of the Soviets
    either before or after the October Revolution. <em>The bourgeoisie
    themselves left the Soviets.</em></p> 

    <p>That is how the matter stands with the question of suffrage for
    the bourgeoisie. It is our task to put the question with absolute
    clarity. We do not in the least apologise for our behaviour, but
    give an absolutely precise enumeration of the facts as they
    are. As we point out, our Constitution was obliged to introduce
    this inequality because the cultural level is low and because with
    us organisation is weak. But we do not make this an ideal; on the
    contrary, in its programme the Party undertakes to work
    systematically to abolish this inequality between the better
    organised proletariat and the peasants. We shall abolish this
    inequality as soon as we succeed in raising the cultural level. We
    shall then be able to get along without such restrictions. Even
    now, after some seventeen months of revolution, these restrictions
    are of very small practical importance.</p> 

    <p>These, comrades, are the main points on which I believed it
    necessary to dwell in the general discussion of the programme, in
    order to leave their further consideration to the
    debate. <em>(Applause.</em>)</p>

      democratic republic, the introduction of the eight-hour day, etc. The

      Polish towns and industrial districts. The Warsaw Soviet of Workers&#8217;
      Deputies set about the factual introduction of the eight-hour day in
      factories, began a struggle against the sabotage of the factory owners,
      took a decision on contacts with revolutionary Russia, etc. The Soviets
      were abolished in the summer of 1919 by the Polish bourgeois
      government.</p>
