    <h3>Speech In Opposition To A Motion

      <br /> To Close The Debate On
      The Report On Work In The Countryside</h3>

    <h4>March 23</h4>

    <p>Comrades, I cannot possibly agree with the preceding speaker,
    because I am sure that under no circumstances will you go straight
    to work in the rural districts after this evening. We members of
    the commission assumed that we were not speaking at this Congress
    only for the benefit of the gathering in this small hall, but for
    the benefit of the whole of Russia, which will not only peruse the
    decisions of our Congress, but will also want to know how much
    interest the Party is displaying in the question of work in the
    rural districts. Therefore, it is necessary to hear what the
    comrades from the districts have to say. If you spend an hour or
    an hour and a half on this, the work in the rural districts will
    not suffer in the least. Therefore, on behalf of the commission, I
    earnestly request that you do not grudge this hour or hour and a
    half. It is not likely that the practical workers who will speak
    here will add much that is new, but for the newspaper-reading
    public all over Russia these few hours of our work will be very
    beneficial.</p>
