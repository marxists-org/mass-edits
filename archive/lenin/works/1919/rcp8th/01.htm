    <h3>Speech Opening The Congress</h3>

    <h4>March 18</h4>


    <p class="fst">Comrades, our first words at this Congress must be
    dedicated to Comrade Yakov Mikhuilovich Sverdlov. Comrades, as
    many people said at his funeral today, Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov
    was, for the Party as a whole and for the entire Soviet Republic,
    the principal organiser, but he was much more valuable for our
    Party Congress and much closer to it. We have lost a comrade who
    devoted his last days entirely to this Congress. His absence will
    affect the whole course of our proceedings, and this Congress will
    feel it with exceptional acuteness. Comrades, I propose that we
    honour his memory by rising. <em>(All rise.</em>)</p> 

    <p>Comrades, we are opening our Party Congress at a very
    difficult, complicated and peculiar stage in the Russian and in
    the world proletarian revolution. In the first period after the
    October Revolution the forces of the Party and of the Soviet
    government were almost entirely absorbed by the tasks of direct
    defence, of offering direct resistance to our enemies, the
    bourgeoisie at home and abroad, who could not reconcile themselves
    to the idea that the socialist republic could exist for any length
    of time. We nevertheless gradually began to consolidate our
    position and the tasks of construction, organisational tasks,
    began to come to the fore. I think that this work of construction
    and organisation should be the keynote of our Congress. The
    programme problems which, from the standpoint of theory present a
    big difficulty and are in the main problems of our development,
    and those that have a special place on the Congress
    agenda&#8212;the organisational question, the question of the Red
    Army and, particularly, the question of work in the
    countryside&#8212;all require us to focus and concentrate our
    attention on the main question, which is a very difficult but
    gratifying one for socialists to grapple with, namely, the
    question of organisation. It must be particularly emphasised here
    that one of the most difficult problems of communist development,
    in a country of small peasant farms, one that we must deal with
    right now, is <em>the problem of our attitude towards the middle
    peasants.</em></p> 

    <p>Comrades, it was natural that in the first period, when we had
    to fight for the Soviet Republic&#8217;s right to existence, this
    question should not have been pushed into the fore ground on an
    extensive scale. The relentless war against the rural bourgeoisie
    and the kulaks gave prominence to the organisation of the rural
    proletariat and semi-proletariat. But by its next step the Party,
    which wants to lay the sound foundations of communist society,
    must take up the task of correctly defining our attitude towards
    the middle peasants. This is a problem of a higher order. We could
    not present it on an extensive scale until we had made secure the
    basis for the existence of the Soviet Republic. This problem is a
    more complicated one and it involves defining our attitude towards
    a numerous and strong section of the population. This attitude
    cannot be defined simply by the answer&#8212;struggle or
    support. As regards the bourgeoisie our task is defined by the
    words &#8220;struggle&#8221;, &#8220;suppression&#8221;, and as
    regards the rural proletariat and semi-proletariat our task is
    defined by the words &#8220;our support&#8221;, but this problem
    is undoubtedly more complicated. On this point, the socialists,
    the best representatives of socialism in the old days, when they
    still believed in the revolution and faithfully adhered to its
    theory and ideals, talked about <em>neutralising the
    peasantry</em>, i.e., making the middle peasants a social stratum
    which, if it did not actively help the proletarian revolution, at
    least would not hinder it, that would remain neutral and not go
    over to the side of our enemies. This abstract, theoretical
    formulation of the problem is quite clear but is inadequate. We
    have reached the stage of socialist development when we must draw
    up definite and detailed rules and regulations which have been
    tested by practical experience in the rural districts to guide us
    in our efforts to place our relations with the middle peasants
    <em>on the basis of a firm alliance</em> and so preclude the pos-
    sibility of a repetition of those mistakes and blunders we have
    repeatedly, made in the past. These blunders estranged the middle
    peasants from us, although we of the Communist Party, the leading
    party, were the first who helped the Russian peasants to throw off
    the yoke of the landowners and establish real democracy, which
    gave us every ground for counting on their complete
    confidence. This is not the type of problem that calls for
    ruthless, swift suppression and attack, it is more
    complicated. But I shall allow myself to say confidently that
    after our twelve months of preliminary work we shall be able to
    cope with this problem.</p>

    <p>A few words about our international situation. Comrades, you
    are all, of course, aware that the founding of the Third,
    Communist International in Moscow is an event of the greatest
    significance insofar as our position in the world is concerned. We
    still have confronting us a vast, real and well armed military
    force&#8212;all the strongest powers of the world. Nevertheless,
    we can confidently say to ourselves that what outwardly seems to
    be a gigantic force, and which physically is immeasurably stronger
    than we are, has been shaken. It is no longer a force. It no
    longer has its former stability. Therefore there is nothing
    utopian in our aim and in the task we set ourselves&#8212;to be
    victorious in the struggle against this giant. On the contrary,
    although we are now artificially cut off from the whole world, the
    newspapers every day report the growth of the revolutionary
    movement in all countries. Moreover, we know, we see, that this
    growing movement is assuming the Soviet form. And this is a
    guarantee that in establishing the Soviet government we discovered
    the <em>international</em>, <em>world form of the dictatorship of
    the proletariat.</em> We are firmly convinced that the proletariat
    all over the world has taken this path of struggle, the creation
    of these forms of proletarian rule, the rule of the workers and of
    the working people in general, and that no power on earth can halt
    the progress of the world communist revolution towards the world
    Soviet republic. <em>(Prolonged applause.</em>)</p> 

    <p>Comrades, permit me now on behalf of the Central Committee of
    the Russian Communist Party to declare the Eighth Congress open
    and proceed to the election of the presidium.</p>
