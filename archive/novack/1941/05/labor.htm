<p class="fst">Of all the cataclysmic changes in American life from 1929 to 1939,
none was more momentous than the growth in the stature of the working
class. During this decade the most decisive and dynamic sections of
the industrial proletariat became organized and began to exercise an
ever-increasing influence upon national and world affairs.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>The End of the Golden Age</H4>
<p class="fst">This epoch was preceded by the Golden Age of American plutocracy,
when the super-profits extorted by our monopolists from their
exploitation of the planet had produced an appearance of limitless
prosperity and progress, momentarily exorcising the spectres
emanating from the aftermath of the first World War. At the peak of
that boom American labor had attained the greatest material heights
of any proletariat in history. The craft aristocracy had received a
small but satisfactory share of imperialist super-profit; their
leaders, like other Babbitts, regarded the Big Business regime in the
&ldquo;good old USA.&rdquo; as the best of all possible worlds.</P>
<P>To be sure, the bulk of the proletariat in the basic industries
had remained unorganized and over-exploited. But this did not trouble
the self-satisfied AFL officialdom so long as their own social
problem was solved and they could afford Havana cigars, Cadillacs,
two-dollar dinners and three-month vacations. They could turn their
backs upon the mass production workers, just as the labor bureaucrats
in England ignored the very existence of the colonial slaves whose
exploitation and oppression formed the basis of their own power and
income.</P>
<P>All good things, however, come to an end, and this Golden Age
vanished with the world crisis of 1929, never to return.</P>
<P>For the next four years the AFL slid down from its eminence,
dragging the bureaucracy along with it, haunch, paunch, and jowl.
Years of famine followed the years of plenty; the American
aristocrats of world labor became pauperized, unemployed, impotent.
The petty-bourgeois leaders of the AFL proved as helpless as the
bourgeois leaders of the USA to halt the degradation of their
institutions. The precipitous economic decline, the blows of the
bourgeoisie, and the incapacity of the AFL leaders had the most
catastrophic consequences for the working class. By the end of 1932
the American trade union movement was completely prostrated.</P>
<P>This same paralysis had seized the entire nation from top to
bottom. The bourgeoisie, under Hoover, floundered helplessly,
powerless to check the decline of their system. The petty-bourgeoisie
scattered in all directions, seeking a program and a leadership to
save them from the consequences of the crisis. The collapse of
capitalism, predicted by the Marxists, had become a reality in the
most powerful capitalist country the world had ever known. This
collapse became complete when the banks closed on March 4, 1933 and
the economic life of the country came to a standstill.</P>
<P>Had the labor movement of the US been sufficiently well-organized,
had its vanguard been sufficiently class-conscious and under the
influence of a revolutionary Bolshevist party, the struggle for
proletarian power against the plutocracy might then and there have
taken place.</P>
<P>But history ordained otherwise. These subjective factors did not
exist; the revolutionary situation passed; and the crisis of American
capitalism was resolved in another manner. Roosevelt came forward on
behalf of the bourgeoisie to assume the leadership of the
petty-bourgeois and proletarian masses. His New Deal program for the
salvation of the USA by way of reform temporarily overcame the social
and political crisis of American capitalism. The attending
international industrial upturn served to reverse the downward trend
of capitalist economy. In the ensuing four years, national and world
conditions enabled Roosevelt&rsquo;s administration to effect a
partial stabilization of the economic and political situation. Thus,
through the agency of the Democratic Party, the preceding
revolutionary crisis was exploited solely for the political benefit
of the American bourgeoisie.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>The New Stage for Labor</H4>
<p class="fst">The four years of crisis, from 1929 to 1933, had its positive as
well as its negative side. In addition to demoralizing and
disorganizing the old labor movement, it destroyed many of the
obstacles that had retarded the advancement of the working class,
thereby creating the pre-conditions for the labor movement to spurt
forward and elevate itself to a higher economic and political plane.
The catastrophe had swept the ground from under the AFL bureaucracy,
weakened their positions within the unions and irretrievably impaired
their prestige among the working masses.</P>
<P>During the boom days before 1929 it was a dogma in official,
liberal and even certain radical circles, that nothing could break
the monopoly of the AFL bureaucracy over the existing labor movement.
Since these AFL leaders would not and could not organize the workers
in the mass production industries, they would not and could not be
organized. The degeneration of the IWW, the failure of the Stalinist
unions of the TUUL to acquire a mass character, and finally, the
paralysis of the industrial workers during the depression, appeared
for a time to confirm this appraisal.</P>
<P>The Marxists alone were not deceived by appearances. In opposition
to the fashionable view that the AFL monopoly of labor leadership was
eternal and unchangeable, the Marxists&rsquo; explained the social
and economic conditions of competitive capitalism that had given rise
to this monopoly. They pointed out that these conditions were
disappearing through the integration of industry and the
concentration of capital under monopolistic control. These profound
alterations in the social organization of production necessarily
entailed correspondingly new forms of proletarian economic and
political organization. Sooner or later, they concluded &ndash;
against those who systematically underestimated the objective
economic necessity and inherent strength of this tendency &ndash; the
industrial workers would, as they must, smash through all barriers
and create for themselves the new forms of proletarian organization
demanded by the changed structure of American industry.</P>
<P>These same factors indicated the falsity of the Stalinist dual
union policy of 1928-1934 &ndash; a policy based on the assumption
that only under the leadership of the Communist Party would the
unorganized be organized. The &ldquo;radical&rdquo; Stalinist policy,
in reality, underestimated the progressive forces in the working
class.</P>
<P>Events confirmed the confidence of the Marxists in the ability of
the industrial proletariat to understand its needs and to fulfill
them. The paralysis turned out to be but a passing phase in the life
of American labor, a transition to an epoch of greater energy than it
had ever before displayed. The crisis had changed not only the
conditions but also the psychology of the proletarian masses. A
widespread demand arose among the workers in the key industries for
their organization into industrial unions. Hitherto this demand had
existed amongst the workers in an inchoate form, and had been clearly
expressed and unwaveringly promoted only by the most advanced
political labor parties. Once the workers felt the need, it required
only a series of external stimuli to push them forward. The economic
impetus was provided by the industrial upturn which began in 1933;
the political stimulation by Section 7-A of the NRA.</P>
<P>After four years of retreat, the proletarian masses shook off
their passivity and initiated an offensive against their capitalist
masters. The revival of the mass labor movement brought with it an
irresistible urge for industrial organization.</P>
<P>While the bourgeois press rejoiced at the economic recovery of
American capitalism and saw in this the most significant
characteristic of the next two years, far more important was the
recovery of American labor. Inspired with fresh confidence by the
reanimation of industry and goaded by their economic.needs, the
workers surged forward in one industry after another to achieve their
demands. Seeking an agency for realizing their aims, the newly
awakened workers turned toward the existing trade union organization.
They streamed into the AFL by the hundreds of thousands; a mighty
expansion not simply of the old craft, but of the new industrial
unions, occurred within the precincts of the old mass organization.
The two antagonistic tendencies of craft versus industrial unionism
competed for mastery in the AFL, completely altering its inner life.</P>
<P>These two years witnessed the formation of new unions and the
extension of the old in many important branches of industry &ndash;
mining, rubber, maritime, teamsters, clothing workers, textiles,
auto, etc. This provided a radically new and substantial foundation
for the further development of the labor movement. These gains were
achieved by means of intense struggles, such as the Minneapolis
teamsters strikes, the first auto workers battles, the textile
struggles, the San Francisco General Strike. Labor was on the march
and, although here and there this or that detachment might be pushed
back by the bosses, the army as a whole moved forward to occupy new
entrenchments in their struggle against capitalist exploitation.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>1935-1937: Establishment of the CIO</H4>
<p class="fst">On the right wing of the AFL stood the old-line bureaucrats,
rooted in the past, fearful of their privileges, hostile toward the
virile new proletarian forces around them, and determined to keep
them subordinate even, if necessary, to dismember them. At the
opposite pole were the industrial workers, determined to organize
themselves, to maintain their organizations, land increase their
strength. A life-and-death struggle took place between these two
tendencies &ndash; the past and the future, the old and the new.</P>
<P>The mass of newly organized workers kept pounding against the
narrow banks of the AFL like a mighty torrent, finally overflowing
its boundaries and digging a new channel for themselves when the old
could no longer contain them.</P>
<P>The period from 1935 to 1937 saw the birth, growth and&rdquo;
expansion of the industrial union movement to the status of a major
factor in American life. In two years the CIO attained a significance
comparable to that which the AFL had attained only after many
decades. This is an index to the speed with which the workers can
act, once they get moving in the proper direction.</P>
<P>The industrial union movement won its independence through the
most violent struggles, against enemies within the labor movement and
outside of it. This young giant challenged the most powerful
corporations, the most solidly entrenched industrial barons. The
power, the militancy and the creative spirit exhibited by the
American proletariat during these titanic struggles should never be
forgotten; they are the pledge of its future. Consider how many
attempts to organize industrial unions had proved abortive, not only
before 1929, but as late as 1934. Consider the entrenched positions
of the craft-union bureaucrats, the antiquated structure of the AFL,
the weight of its traditions. Consider the power of the industrial
overlords.</P>
<P>None of these obstacles or enemies deterred the mass of workers.
They were driven by social necessity to find a farm of organization
suited to their economic lives and struggles and, after many
experiments and defeats, they finally found it in the CIO. So strong
was the mass pressure for industrial unionism that it pulled along a
significant section of the AFL bureaucracy itself. Lewis, Hillman,
Dubinsky and others helped organize and lead the industrial union
movement within the AFL. When that movement threatened to be
strangled and dismembered by more conservative bureaucrats, the
struggle between the progressive and reactionary factions came to a
head. The shell of the old unionism was cracked and the CIO stepped
forth upon its independent career.</P>
<P>The CIO then organized for the first time the workers in the auto,
steel, rubber, aluminum, electrical and other basic industries. The
militancy and indomitable spirit of the industrial proletariat was
exhibited at its best in the auto industry. Although the auto workers
suffered betrayals from a dozen different sources, extending from
their own leaders to President Roosevelt, they nevertheless succeeded
in establishing and maintaining their union against all assaults.</P>
<P>The CIO set a new high mark in aggressive class action with the
sit-down strikes, which effected the unionization of the auto
industry and which were the real pressure for the signing of the
contract with Big Steel without a fight. The real significance of the
sit-down strikes of 1936-1937 must be clearly understood. The
sit-down strike is a <I>revolutionary</I> weapon for the economic
organization and struggle of the proletariat. By taking physical
possession of the factories, the workers thereby deny the absolute
legal and social right of the capitalist to control and operate his
material means of production. The workers assault and abridge the
privileges of private property ownership. For the duration of the
sit-down strikes, the workers impose their control over capitalist
property and set their class will against that of their bosses.</P>
<P>No capitalist class or government can tolerate the continuance of
such revolutionary acts of defiance toward capitalist property
rights. Chrysler was correct when, in full-page advertisements
published during the sit-down strikes in his plant, he stated that
the auto workers&rsquo; action was revolutionary and confiscatory.
But it was so mainly by implication. The workers themselves were not
conscious of the revolutionary significance of their behavior. They
had only the most limited economic aims in mind when they seized the
factories and remained in them.</P>
<P>But this does not lessen the objective significance of their
action. The sit-down strikes demonstrated that the vanguard of the
American proletariat is fully capable of revolutionary action against
the capitalist system, even though they were not then, and are not
yet, completely aware of the underlying implications of their class
conduct.</P>
<P>The sit-down strike is the seed of which workers&rsquo; control of
production on a national scale can be the flower. The workers need
only to say, after taking over the plant &ndash; &ldquo;Here we are,
here we remain, nothing will drive us out,&rdquo; and then to extend
this anti-capitalist attitude to the bourgeois state, for the
proletarian revolution to become a fact.</P>
<P>During this period, the CIO definitely established itself not only
as an important factor in American industry but also in American
politics. Roosevelt&rsquo;s re-election in 1936 was due in no small
measure to his support by the CIO.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>1937-1939: Trade Unionism Consolidates Its New Basis</H4>
<p class="fst">The sharp drop in industrial production toward the end of 1937
slowed down the expansion of the trade union movement. The main
problem for the labor movement during the next two years was the
maintenance of the newly-won positions and the defense of the gains
against capitalist assault. When the recession set in, the employers
endeavored to cut wages and make the workers bear the full burden of
the slackening in production, as they had done after 1929. But the
capitalists had to deal with an entirely different working class in
1938 and 1939.</P>
<P>This time the workers had sufficient organizational strength to
fight on more equal terms. Instead of routing the trade unions and
beating them down to the ground, the bosses were compelled to act
extremely cautiously, to moderate their demands, and to effect all
kinds of compromises with the organized workers. The mighty power
lodged within the working class as a result of previous organization
and struggle manifested itself at this point in its ability to
withstand the attacks of the employing class.</P>
<P>The AFL and CIO dug into their entrenched positions and refused to
yield ground to the employers without struggle. This period tested
the stability and resisting powers of the new labor movement. The
trade union movement proved that it had consolidated itself upon the
twin basis of the AFL and CIO.</P>
<P>The economic recession manifested itself in a corresponding
recession in the militancy of the workers and in a general trend
toward reaction on the part of the trade union leadership. This
expressed itself in the attempts of the Hutchesons and Wolls to
tomahawk the CIO; in the return of the ILGWU and the typographers to
the AFL, and in the more cautious and conservative policy pursued by
the CIO leaders themselves. Nevertheless this reaction did not
proceed very far, and it was reversed when the ebbing strength of the
CIO became renewed by the war boom.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Achievements of American Labor: 1934-1940</H4>
<p class="fst">What did American labor accomplish by its struggles from 1934 to
1940?</P>
<p class="fst">1. <I>The decisive section of the proletariat in the mass
production industries owned and controlled by monopoly capitalism has
been unionised.</I> Today over 10 million workers belong to the CIO,
AFL and Railroad Brotherhoods, constituting the strongest labor
movement in the whole capitalist world.</P>
<P>This is a material social factor of the utmost importance. For the
first time the vanguard of the American proletariat has been
economically organized as a <I>class</I>. It has been unified along
industrial lines on a continental scale. This trade union movement
forms the basis and provides the arena for the work of the
revolutionary party. It is the chief stronghold of the working class.
Its existence and independence must be guarded against every attempt
to abridge or undermine it.</P>
<P>American industry has the most highly integrated character of any
in the world. Its compact, centralized structure is reflected in the
character of proletarian organization and determines the general
nature of its activity. Owing to this highly organized character, all
impulses, tendencies and ideas are transmitted with tremendous speed
throughout the proletarian movement. A tie-up in auto production
immediately affects rubber, glass, steel, coal, and many other key
industries. The working class is thus bound together and tends to
function more and more as a single organism. This fact must
immeasurably facilitate the rapid spread of revolutionary ideas and
programs once our party has established itself in the nerve centers
of the trade union movement.</P>
<p class="fst">2. <I>The craft leaders of the Woll and Hutcheson school are
losing ground within the AFL itself.</I> The AFL numbers more members
today than ever before. But the significant additions in membership
have come in unions which have adapted themselves to the CIO, living
in relative amity with it. The Teamsters International, now the
largest, most powerful and rapidly growing unit of the AFL, best
exemplifies this process. While recognizing the decisive significance
of the CIO, it would be a tremendous mistake to make a fetish of the
CIO and view the AFL as a dead or dying organization. One should
rather penetrate beneath the formal appearance of division within the
labor movement and base one&rsquo;s trade union policy upon the
strong bonds which unite the workers in both organizations and pull
them towards unity &ndash; not only in separate strike struggles, but
also on an all-inclusive organizational basis. The division between
the two branches of the labor movement is perpetuated not by the
workers themselves but by their leaders; and above all by the
treacherous AFL die-hards.</P>
<p class="fst">3. <I>The years of struggle have left an indelible mark upon the
consciousness of the American workers.</I> Hundreds of thousands,
millions, of workers in the mass production industries have had to
fight prolonged and fierce battles to win recognition of their unions
and to maintain them. They have been compelled to use the strike
weapon time and again. They have fought against company police,
spies, stool-pigeons, local police, state troops, the snares of
arbitration boards, the President and his crew of strike-stranglers,
and the conservatism of their own leaders. Despite all these
strike-breaking agencies and class collaborationist institutions,
they have come out of these tremendous battles as victors. They have
tested and tempered their forces and developed leaders in their ranks
who will become the officers of the revolutionary army.</P>
<P>The actual class struggle is the greatest school of education for
the working class. There is no substitute for such experience. Only
their activities in the class struggle can arouse the masses and
train them for the revolution. This is triply true in our own epoch
and our own country. Every strike discloses beneath its surface the
hydra-head of the proletarian revolution, which the capitalist
usually discerns far more quickly than the workers themselves. The
general and sit-down strikes were rehearsals for bigger battles
ahead. More than anything else they disclose the dynamism latent
within the American working class and its revolutionary capabilities.</P>
<p class="fst">4. <I>Unlike their European brothers, the American workers have
not known a debilitating or enduring defeat.</I> They stand today at
the height of their power. On the threshhold of war, the workers are
pushing forward on all economic fronts, extending their gains. The
American workers can find little evidence in their own recent
experiences that they cannot get what they want, provided they fight
hard enough for it.</P>
<p class="fst">5. Although the changes in this sphere are not yet so sharply
outlined and perfected as in the economic field, the <I>organised
labor movement is also beginning to play a new and different role in
the political life of the country.</I> The AFL officialdom continues
its old policy of bargaining with capitalist party machines,
according to the maxim of &ldquo;reward your friends and punish your
enemies,&rdquo; which means in reality, reward the capitalists and
punish the workers. They yield, on principle, the commanding role in
politics to the organizations of the capitalist class and allot a
subordinate role to the working class.</P>
<P>The CIO, on the other hand, owes its existence to the direct and
independent mass action of the industrial workers. This social factor
has already manifested itself in the political form &ndash; still
embryonic &ndash; of a growing demand for independent class action in
politics. The CIO leaders bowdlerized this demand in forming the
American Labor Party in New York and Labor&rsquo;s Non-Partisan
League in the 1936 election. These moves have been in large measure
mere formal concessions to the rank and file clamor for independent
labor political action, since the policies of these organizations
have consisted for the main part in supporting capitalist party
candidates and programs. They nevertheless represent dwarfed and
distorted expressions of the underlying urge toward the creation of a
national labor party based upon the trade unions. Just as the trend
toward industrial unionism broke through the barriers of the old
craft unionism, so the irresistible trend toward proletarian
politics, will sooner or later burst the confines of its present
framework and result in the formation of a mass labor political
organization.</P>
<P>The workers helped re-elect Roosevelt both in 1936 and 1940,
voting as a unit when they did so. They have succeeded in extorting
from the capitalist government and a conservative Congress valuable
concessions: wage and hours laws, social security, Wagner Labor Act,
WPA, PWA, etc. If organized labor, without independent political
organization, has so strongly impressed its influence upon the
nation&rsquo;s politics surely this influence will be a thousand-fold
more forcible and formidable once it achieves independent
organization.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>The Titanic Power of American Labor</H4>
<p class="fst">Between 1934 and 1940 the titanic power of American labor
manifested itself in three different forms and stages: first in an
aggressive advance and victorious assault against the ununionized
sectors of American industry, then in a stubborn and solid resistance
against the counter-attack of the bourgeoisie. With the large-scale
preparations for war during 1941, the situation took another turn.
This same power again assumed an aggressive form but on a higher
level of development.</P>
<P>This titanic power will enable the American proletariat to tear up
the existing society by its roots and to construct a new one. It is
upon this material power, and not upon any mystical faith in the
mission of the proletariat as a &ldquo;chosen people,&rdquo; that the
revolutionary party of Marxism bases its perspective of proletarian
revolution.</P>
<P>The renegades, the radicals for a day, and all the camp followers
of the big and little bourgeoisie neither feel, see, nor understand
the significance of this mighty historical force. They have no faith
in the ability of the proletariat to solve its own problems and
therewith the major problems of the American people. They must
therefore place their faith in some other class force. Under the
conditions of our epoch this can mean, in the last analysis, only the
decadent, reactionary bourgeoisie.</P>
<P>But the American workers have already given the lie to these
stupid and short-sighted petty-bourgeois falterers. In six years the
American workers, by their own unaided efforts, organized themselves
as an economic unit from the Atlantic to the Pacific; they created
the most vital trade union organization in the world today &ndash;
the CIO.</P>
<P>Two simultaneous and opposing processes of mobilization, training
and conscription have been going on in this country. On one side the
capitalist government is conscripting its armies for the imperialist
conquest of the globe. On the other side, the American proletariat
has been summoning, mobilizing, and training its class forces for
another kind of war: the war against capitalist exploitation and
social slavery.</P>
<P>If one should ask, who will win that war? the American proletariat
has already indicated its answer. We, the workers, will win! To help
prepare the conditions for that victory and to hasten its advent is
the task of our party.</p>
