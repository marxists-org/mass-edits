<h2>England For All</h2>

<hr class="section" />
<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p class="fst">Thus in every direction the policy of the democracy is clear and well-defined. Freedom, social reorganization, thorough unity at home, justice, self-government, and consideration for our colonies and dependencies, and a warm friendship and ready assistance for the oppressed peoples abroad, &#8211; such is the work we are called upon to begin and carry out. Democracy, which the so-called &#8220;governing classes&#8221; jeer at as anarchy, incapacity, and self-seeking, means a close federation, first, of our own people, and next, of the workers of the civilized world. This is a policy not of to-day or of to-morrow, now to be taken up and again to be laid aside; it is an undertaking in which each can continuously bear his share, and hand on the certainty of success to his fellow.</p>

<p>The current of events will help on the cause of the people. Within the past generation greater changes have been wrought than in centuries of human existence before. For the first time in the history of mankind the whole earth is at our feet. Railways, telegraphs, steam communications, have but just begun to exercise an influence. Education and intercourse are breaking down the barriers of ages. The men who do the work of the world are learning from one another how it is that the poor and the miserable, the unfortunate and the weak, suffer and fall by the wayside. In our own country, which has led the way to the new stage of social development, all can see that the lot of the many is sad, whilst the few are rich and luxurious far beyond what is beneficial even to them. Our action in redress of these inequalities and better ordering of our affairs will guide and encourage the world. We, perhaps, alone among the peoples can carry out with peace, order, and contentment those changes which continental revolutionists have sought through anarchy and bloodshed. Religion, which should have helped in this striving for a happier period, has suffered the rich and powerful to twist its teachings to their own account. Now, therefore, is the time, in the face of difficulties and dangers which threaten from many quarters, for Englishmen of all classes, creeds, and conditions to push aside the petty bickerings of faction or the degrading influence of mere selfish interests, to the end that by sympathy and fellow-feeling for their own and for others they may hold up a nobler ideal to mankind. Such an ideal is not unreal or impracticable. Not as yet of course can we hope to realize more than a portion of that for which we strive. But if only we are true to one another, and stand together in the fight, the brightness of the future is ours &#8211; the day before us and the night behind. So, when those who come after look back to these islands as we now look back to Athens or Palestine, they shall say, &#8211; &#8220;This was glory &#8211; this true domination; these men builded on eternal foundations their might, majesty, dominion, and power.&#8221;</p>
