<h3>Further Reminiscences</h3>

<hr class="section" />
<h1>Preface</h1>

<br />
<p class="fst">MY first volume of <strong>Reminiscences</strong> was so kindly received, both by my critics and by the public at large, that in the present book I have brought them up to date. I scarcely dare to hope, however, for the like good fortune with regard to these somewhat numerous additional pages. I have been rash enough to speak of recent events and of well-known people still living with as much frankness as I indulged in before, when dealing with more remote matters and persons. I recognise that this has its drawbacks. It is possible, nevertheless, that some readers may not object to seeing the problems of our daily life, and the characters of a few of those who are endeavouring to handle them, sketched from a different standpoint from that which is usually occupied. I have done my best to put what I have to say clearly, and with as little of prejudice as is possible for one who has always tried to be in the thick of the fight.</p>
