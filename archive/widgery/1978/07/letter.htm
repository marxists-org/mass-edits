<p class="fst">Dear <strong>Socalist Review</strong>,</p>

<p class="fst">Atrocious articles on Carnival. Mr Calico Nickers wants to harness and channel the energy of &#8216;Youth&#8217; who have ten times more idea of what&#8217;s going down than your pretty average Marxist Editor.</p>

<p>John Rose&#8217;s trotskyist&#8217;s youth leaders guide to kids is painful (but he&#8217;d do a great album requests show).</p>

<p>&#8216;Rastafarianism is totally pessimistic ...&#8217; says the Chief Scout. On the contrary almost without exception the music names the oppressors and calls for unity and struggle.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t understand how religious forms contain deeply political meanings you won&#8217;t understand anything about black music ... take a Phensic.</p>

<p>Worst of all is the Hoyland/Flood Page stuff on RAR. How dare you ask them? With all that stuff about RAR being &#8216;Fun music with no political connections&#8217; and punk is dead (which they&#8217;ve been saying since before it started).</p>

<p>Look lets get it straight. Punk is one of the most important <em>working class</em> cultural things to ever happen. Is it too much to ask that the Left (two years too late, as usual) LISTEN to the stuff ... and don&#8217;t use the Dansette. Open your ears ... and then your mind ... and maybe your EYES ... and Hair Dyes.</p>

<p>The dynamic Music for Pleasure Duo think &#8216;The task is to cement this union&#8217; (Music and Politics). Grand. Haven&#8217;t you ever heard of RAR (Oh Yes you once came along and told us Roots was a Bourgeois Concept). The duo want it to die ... to justify their own low-energy and inaction. But the kids won&#8217;t let it. RAR&#8217;s swansong is being played <em>now</em>, the new TRB/Clash is tuning in/out at your local Yuuff Club.</p>

<p>They say RAR is the fun-angle and MfS is the political hit. They don&#8217;t understand working class kids NOW are political and fun without having to make 5 minute speeches to prove it. Mickey Mouse Disaster Time. It&#8217;s the sort of stuff we&#8217;d expect to read in ... shoddy-Marxism which <strong>SR</strong> should <em>read</em> like <strong>The Friends of Albanian Quarterly</strong>. Fact. <strong>The Leveller</strong> had a GREAT article which <strong>SR</strong> readers should read.</p>

<p class="fst">Yours in dismay<br />
Dave Widgery, Ruth Gregory, Syd Shelton, Roger (Dub) Huddle <em>(Dem heavier than before)</em></p>

<p class="fst">P.S. Roger Huddle doesn&#8217;t think the <strong>Leveller</strong> article is as good as what he has writ in this ish.</p>
