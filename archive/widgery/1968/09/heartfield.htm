<p class="fst">THE FIRST BRITISH exhibition of the posters and photomontages of Johnny Heartsfield <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>, whose art put him on the Nazi death list, has been blocked by the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>Although difficulties had arisen in the planning stages of the show, the FO has used the invasion of Czechoslovakia to introduce a secret and selective package of cultural sanctions which blacklists Heartsfield. Two weeks ago the Tory boss of Camden Council, Councillor Geoffrey Finsberg, used his &ldquo;indignation at the invasion of Czechoslovakia&rdquo; to personally [<em>text missing</em>] cil has been told by the FO that they will not allow Heartsfield&rsquo;s agitational political art for exhibition in any site in England.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Soviet State Orchestra continues its British tour untroubled and the Red Army songsters will arrive this month.<br />

<h4>Rejection</h4>

<p class="fst">Heartsfield, whose real name was Helmut Herzfeld, adopted an English name as part of his life-long rejection of German nationalism. He avoided conscription in the first war by pretending to be mad and then went on to edit several anti-war satirical magazines from secret addresses.</p>

<p>In collaboration with the [<em>text missing</em>] cartoon making. His technical inventiveness in this period made him a major figure in art history.</p>

<p>After escaping Hitler, Heartsfield lived in England where he experienced British political cartooning, British satirical cabaret and British detention camps. The last 15 years of his life were in Ulbricht&rsquo;s East Germany where his art was overlooked by the cultural apparatus men.</p>

<p>Unable to find a publisher in East Germany who would recognise socialist art when he saw it, a deeply dissatisfied Heartsfield worked mainly in theatre design. The cultural smog cleared a little towards the end of his life and the East Germans felt safe to make [<em>text missing</em>]</p>

<p>Today Heartsfleld&rsquo;s revolutionary work finds authentic echo in the posters of the People&rsquo;s Studio which was founded during the May revolution in France and which has found a footing in England among the group around Agit Prop.</p>

<p>Despite the Foreign Office ban, Heartsfield&rsquo;s work and its living tradition remain proof that art can be realist, popular and genuinely political, without painting soup cans or power stations.</p>
