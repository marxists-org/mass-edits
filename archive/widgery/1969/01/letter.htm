<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, <a href="../../../../history/etol/newspape/sw-gb/1969/index.html#n0106" target="new">No. 106</a>, 25 January 1969, p.&nbsp;3.<br />

<p class="fst">IN THESE HEADY days perhaps it is felt by <strong>Socialist Worker</strong> that its supporters are likely to have increased difficulty in spotting the difference between IS and the Socialist Labour League.</p>

<p>Otherwise I see little point in the recent attacks on the SLL, a revolutionary socialist organisation, and David Mercer who, along with Dennis Potter, is a playwright British socialists have a right to be proud of.</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of IS, until fairly recently, has been its political modesty, its recognition of the still tiny size of the revolutionary movement, and its repudiation of the sub-marxist cabbage water which passes as polemics on much of the far Left.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s leave the Bolshevik situation comedy to those groups who can only retain members by misleading them about the real shape of the Left.</p>
