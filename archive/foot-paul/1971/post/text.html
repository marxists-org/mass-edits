<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p class="fst">The postal strike of 1971 was by a long way the biggest industrial
dispute in Britain since the war. It lasted exactly the same number
of days as the next biggest &#8211; the seamen&#8217;s strike of 1966 &#8211; but
there were more than four times as many workers on strike. In terms
of days lost and numbers of strikers, no other dispute can compare
with it.</p>
<p class="fst">The strike lasted for 44 days, during all of which more than 90%
of the members of the Union of Post Office Workers remained on strike
without strike pay. Yet, at the end, they went back to work without
even the promise that they would receive any greater pay increase
than they were offered at the outset. Despite desperate attempts to
cheer his members up, the union&#8217;s general secretary made it plain
that he would have preferred, if possible, to continue with the
strike. The Press, the employers and the employers&#8217; Government
could scarcely contain their glee at the humiliation of 200,000
postal workers. Gutter cartoonists and gutter politicians joined in
the triumphal dance over what they imagined was the corpse of the
postal union.</p>
<p>This pamphlet is written within a fortnight of the end of the
strike. It is written for the tens of thousands of postal workers who
are still suffering from shock at the calling-off of the strike.</p>
<p>Why did the strike take place? Why did the union collapse? Above
all, how can workers everywhere who seek to improve their wages and
conditions insure against a similar disaster? These are the questions
which this pamphlet tries to answer.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Part 1. The Post Office</h4>
<p class="fst">The Post Office is the oldest nationalised industry in the
country, and the biggest. It employs more than 400,000 people (more
than any other single concern), and ever since letters circulated has
been responsible to the Government for the &#8220;carriage of mails&#8221;.
From the outset, it developed a tradition of &#8220;public service&#8221;.
Every citizen has the statutory right to delivery at his address of
letters correctly addressed and posted to him, and in promptness,
regularity and efficiency the British postal service is the best in
the world. Similarly, the telephone service, which was incorporated
into the Post Office, is incomparably more efficient in Britain than
in countries like America where the telephones are in the hands of
private enterprise.</p>
<p>Yet the Post Office, like other alleged &#8220;public services&#8221;,
operates inside a society where the powerful men are the rich men.
The way in which the Post Office works, therefore, is biased in
favour of industry, commerce, banking and the civil service &#8211; 
anywhere, that is, where the interests of rich and powerful men are
immediately identifiable.</p>
<p>Revenue from the postal services, for instance, comes to the Post
Office by way of stamps. Firms and industries which post large
quantities of letters do not buy stamps. They can buy franking
machines which are regulated by the Post Office. If they post more
than 5,000 units at a time, they can get the local post office to do
the franking for them <em>free of charge</em>. One Post Office union
secretary told me that four men out of 25 at his sorting office have
to be detailed off on overtime every day to deal with this job, for
which the customer does not pay a penny.</p>
<p>Even more interesting is the system whereby the Post Office offers
a rebate to firms which post in bulk.</p>
<p>The amount of the rebate, laid down in the <strong>Post Office Guide</strong>, is
as follows:</p>

<p class="fst">The <strong>Post Office Guide</strong> goes on to list conditions for the rebate.
The packets, it says, must be identical, and they must be sorted into
towns and counties &#8220;as required by the local Postmaster&#8221;.</p>
<p>The words &#8220;as required by the local Postmaster&#8221; are crucial,
for the collection and sorting of rebated post is settled in local
&#8220;deals&#8221; between local postmasters and firms. Most firms which do
big postal business will make sure that they get on excellent terms
with the local postmaster, and end up with handsome bargains on their
postal costs.</p>
<p>One UPW union official told me:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Not 1% of the rebated post is sorted, and even if it
is sorted it makes very little difference to our work. We still have
to break open the parcels of post and check every address. Sometimes
the sorting is <em>more</em> difficult when it is sorted by firms
beforehand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Before 1968, these rebates applied only to &#8220;printed paper and
samples&#8221;, which, of course, included a mass of business post. But
after 1968, when the two-tier post was introduced, the old &#8220;printed
paper and samples&#8221; category was dispensed with. The rebates then
applied to <em>all second class post sent in bulk.</em> This meant a
huge increase in the rebate (or subsidy, to use a better word) with
which the Post Office &#8220;helped out&#8221; the growing army of firms
which were posting in bulk. Many firms found it extremely fruitful to
save up their less urgent post for one day a week, and thus claim a
much larger rebate from the Post Office.</p>
<p>What is the extent of the rebate? Unhappily, but not surprisingly,
rebate statistics are &#8220;not available&#8221; to the public, even if they
are ever collated (which is doubtful). The long annual report and
accounts of the Post Office carries no facts or figures about the
extent to which industry and commerce are subsidised by the rebate
system. Similarly, the Prices and Incomes Board which looked at Post
Office charges in 1968 made no inquiry into how the Post Office gets
its revenue, or how it might increase its revenue by stopping a
gratuitous and unnecessary subsidy to firms. All the Post Office will
say is that &#8220;about a third&#8221; of its postal traffic is metered, and
that the bulk of the metered traffic is subsidised. From a big
sub-post office in North London, I got rather different figures for
deliveries in a typical week last year:</p>

<p class="fst">Thirty-five million letters are posted in Britain every day. Since
there are less than 35 million adults in Britain today, it is clear
that most letters are not sent by sweethearts, or soldiers on
overseas duty, or even by grannies on the kiddies&#8217; birthday. They
are sent by Littlewoods, Barclays, the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>, ICI,
and so on.</p>
<p>The complete lack of official statistics forces us to guess at the
extent of the subsidy which the Post Office hands out to pools firms,
mail order firms and big business year by year. If a third of the
letters posted are subsidised to the tune of some 20%, the extent of
the subsidy is in the region of &#0163;18m a year &#8211; rather more in fact
than the Post Office estimate of the cost of the full Union of Post
Office Workers claim for its members on the postal side. If the
figure is even remotely right, it means that the &#8220;losses&#8221;
sustained by the postal side of the Post Office in any one of the
last 10 years could have been wiped out if the rich men&#8217;s subsidy
had been abolished. And this does not take into account the
tremendous losses to the Post Office from not charging so many firms
for franking their mail.</p>
<p>There is another area of subsidy which is also impossible to
measure because of the refusal of the Post Office authorities to
collate (or publish) statistics. When the Post Office was part of the
civil service, the civil service mail was heavily subsidised. This
subsidy was carried on after the Post Office Corporation was set up
outside the civil service! It is impossible to tell how great is the
subsidy on the millions of letters, cards and parcels sent out by the
civil service, but it would be enough to pay a few thousand postmen a
decent wage!</p>
<p>The change-over from a civil service department to a
&#8220;fully-fledged public Corporation&#8221; started soon after the
election of a Labour Government in 1966 and was completed in October
1969. During this period, &#8220;business standards&#8221; were applied to
the Post Office, and this meant, inevitably, a fantastic increase in
bosses and bosses&#8217; underlings.</p>
<p>In 1966, 11,300 million letters were handled by the Post Office.
In 1969 the figure was almost exactly the same. In a series of
vicious productivity agreements, the number of postmen had been cut
from 101,063 to 100,991, postmen higher grade from 21,250 to 20,809
and counter-men in the post offices from 22,183 to 21,584.</p>
<p>In 1966 there had been 9,889 Post Office administrators. In 1969
there were 12,300. Supervisors increased in the same period from
9,974 to 11,295. The richer the gravy, the more people there were to
lap it up. There were 31 Post Office directors in 1966 &#8211; and 51 in
1969. All of them are getting a minimum of &#0163;6,600 a year. As a
branch secretary wrote to his union magazine <strong>The Post</strong> (March
29, 1969):</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In my own area since Modified Postal Services we have
acquired a further two assistant district postmasters, two chief
inspectors, two assistant superintendents, and have lost one
superintendent. We have been concentrated, de-concentrated,
satellited, de-satellited. We have been two-tiered and
semi-two-tiered and all this time the top brass have been increasing
like sex-mad rabbits.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Postal workers, and others who use the Post Office, were a little
bemused as to the value of this burgeoning of bosses. The bosses&#8217;
financial forecast in 1970 (after the union&#8217;s last wage increase}
resulted in a shortfall of &#0163;52m. Third-rate public relations and
managerial incompetence led to early failure both of the &#8220;two-
tier&#8221; postal system and of the Giro. As for &#8220;mechanisation&#8221;
(the main excuse given for the increase in management), there is
still only one fully mechanised office &#8211; at Croydon. Even at
Croydon, the new machines have led to dreadful difficulties, not
least the increase in damage to mail. &#8220;The machines tear up the
letters something terrible&#8221;, a Croydon postman told me. &#8220;We used
to have one man to repair damaged mail. Now, with the machines, there
are three, working overtime patching and sticking up ripped-up
letters and cheques.&#8221; Mechanisation elsewhere is being held up
because many of the special codes sent out to the public by the Post
Office contain seven digits, while the machines to deal with them are
made to deal with six digits. Fifty-one directors have since been
puzzling over an awkward dilemma. Should new codes be sent out or
should the machines be changed? Either expense, of course, will be
blamed on the postal workers. The directors don&#8217;t get &#0163;6,600 a
year for nothing!</p>
<p>Yet the postal side has long since ceased to interest the mass of
Post Office Board directors. They are increasingly fascinated with
the telecommunications division, where profits have been rising to
astonishing proportions:</p>

<p class="fst">The increasing army of bosses in the telecommunications division
are drawn almost exclusively from private enterprise. Jobs are
swapped year by year between the Division&#8217;s Equipment Department
and the boardroom of Plessey (which supplies most of the equipment).
When the Post Office left the civil service and became a Corporation,
there was some pressure from his supporters on Mr. John Stonehouse,
the Labour Government&#8217;s Postmaster-General, to sweep away the
&#8220;time-honoured&#8221; restrictions which prevented the Post Office
manufacturing its own equipment. Stonehouse withstood the pressure.
&#8220;Render unto Plessey the things that are Plessey&#8217;s&#8221; was his
argument. Although the Bill contained the &#8220;ultimate&#8221; power for
the Post Office to manufacture its own equipment, this would only be
used, Mr. Stonehouse explained, &#8220;where it became obvious that
supplies would not otherwise be available&#8221;.</p>
<p>The new big businessmen in the Post Office telecommunications
division and their friends in industry outside are goggling at the
fantastic increases in telephone profits. Unlike postal services, 74%
of whose costs are in paying wages and salaries, telephones need less
and less labour (only 47% of their costs are labour costs). What a
tragedy it is, moan the businessmen in the Post Office, that these
enormous profits are wasted in a Public Board &#8211; are ploughed back
into telephone machinery or used to prop up a loss-making postal
service. If only, oh, if only these highly profitable services could
be put in the hands of private enterprise!</p>
<p>These sentiments were voiced enthusiastically by the Conservative
Opposition during the passing of the Post Office Bill through
Parliament early in 1969. Mr. Kenneth Baker, one of the brightest
stars in the Conservative firmament and a personal prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Mr.
Edward Heath, moved an amendment to Clause 7 of the Bill:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;to give the Corporation authority to offer for sale to
the public either by way of equity shares or loan stock any part of
its telecommunications services.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Party of which I am a member&#8221;, said Mr. Baker,
&#8220;believes that the role of the public sector should be limited and
reduced wherever possible.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">What Mr. Baker meant, of course, was as follows:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Party of which I am a member is run for the sake
of rich and greedy businessmen who are longing to get their fingers
on the telephone loot.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Mr. Baker&#8217;s amendment was pressed to a division (and lost), but
when the Conservative Party was returned to office in June 1970 (Mr.
Baker was thrown out at Acton, but returned a few months later in
safe Marylebone) the robbers came out of their caves and demanded the
hand-over of the telephones. At the Conservative Party conference in
Blackpool in October 1970, Mr. Geoffrey Finsberg, new Tory MP for
Hampstead and a prominent member of the Telephone Users Consultative
Council (an organisation run almost entirely by and for businessmen),
made a rousing speech pointing out the &#8220;opportunities for
enterprise and initiative&#8221; in the telephone service. His speech was
greeted with a roar of applause, and Mr. Finsberg has since been
named as a possible chairman of the Post Office Board.</p>
<p>The Board, meanwhile, whose public relations staff, needless to
say, had increased by some 20% in four years, remained silent.
Nothing was said in defence of the &#8220;public interest&#8221; of the
Board&#8217;s operations against the &#8220;private interest&#8221; of Finsberg &amp;
Co. Ltd. For the truth is that most of the men on the Board in charge
of telecommunications have no objection to the wholesale transfer of
the telephone service to private enterprise. They would be assured
plum jobs and substantial shareholdings in the new private telephone
companies. The attitude of the Post Office Board towards Tory demands
for private enterprise telephones had nothing to do with the &#8220;public
service&#8221; tradition of the Post Office. Public service to them meant
an unprofitable postal service, especially cheap for businessmen, run
by a nationalised industry, and profitable telephones run by
themselves. Such priorities, needless to say, ignored one rather
important group of people &#8211; the 400,000 who worked in both sectors
of the Post Office. These people had for more than 100 years been
treated by the Post Office with consistent cruelty and contempt.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Part 2. The Union</h4>
<p class="fst">The UK Postmen&#8217;s Association was formed in the wake of the
legislation of 1871 and 1875 legalising trade unions, it was swiftly
pulverised by the &#8220;impartial&#8221; Post Office administration. The
leaders of the executive were arbitrarily sacked. Tom Dredge, the
most militant of the founding executive members, was only allowed
back to work on condition he apologised for past activities and
promised to do nothing so horrible in the future as to &#8220;incite&#8221;
his colleagues with evil talk about better wages and conditions.
Dredge finally agreed to the conditions, and the Association
collapsed.</p>
<p>The Postmen&#8217;s Union was then formed in 1889 under the militant
leadership of engineers and dockers drafted in from the &#8220;new
unionism&#8221; movement. At once, the union demanded a withdrawal of the
departmental rule that postmen were not allowed to meet outside
office hours to discuss their grievances. The department replied with
a direct negative, and prepared to fight. Union leaders were harassed
with petty charges of indiscipline, and a reserve force of unemployed
were carefully rehearsed as blacklegs. The department was also able
to split the postmen by carefully fostering and bribing members of
different, splinter associations, especially the Fawcett Association
of sorters. When blacklegs were forcibly removed by union members on
July 10 from Mount Pleasant, 100 unionists were instantly dismissed
by the Post Office and the attempt to get the rest of London postmen
to come out in their support was bungled. Most of the men publicly
washed their hands of the union, and the department consolidated its
victory with widespread victimisation.</p>
<p>It was not until after the First World War that the various
splinter unions in the Post Office were amalgamated into the Union of
Post Office Workers. In the militant atmosphere of their amalgamating
conference in 1919, the delegates to the new union declared their
faith in trade union principles and voted overwhelmingly for the
setting up of a strike fund. They were reckoning without the
deep-seated anti-trade union feelings among postmen, especially among
the better-paid grades. The strike fund was put to ballot, and was
carried by only 48,157 to 35,411 (with 23,400 abstentions).</p>
<p>The Post Office administration responded by cherishing the
federations of smaller unions which had refused to join the UPW.
Hysterical anti-trade union propaganda was openly circulated among
their workers by the Post Office management. The strike fund was held
up as proof of the evil intentions of &#8220;anarchist agitators&#8221; who
were intent on destroying the &#8220;impartial&#8221; traditions of the Post
Office.</p>
<p>The campaign was successful. By 1921, the 100,000 membership at
the amalgamation conference had shrunk to 72,000. In September 1921
the union executive decided to suspend the strike levy fund
indefinitely. As a result, there was no strike fund in the union for
more than 40 years. And then it was too late.</p>
<p>Throughout, the union was plagued by the ambiguous status of its
members. Many members still regarded themselves as uniformed civil
servants &#8211; &#8220;a cut above&#8221; the proletariat. The Post Office
bosses did everything they could to foster this image. In 1927, the
Conservative Government passed a <em>Trades Dispute Act</em> which
banned the postmen&#8217;s union from affiliation to the Labour Party or
to the Trades Union Congress. The union was therefore forced into
isolation for 20 years until the Act was repealed by the post-war
Labour Government (the 1929&#8211;31 Labour Government left the Act on
the statute book). In the same year, the bosses arbitrarily increased
the staff side of the Whitley Council covering the industry by two &#8211; 
both members representing tiny &#8220;secessionist&#8221; associations. As a
result, the UPW walked out of the Whitley Council, only to return
five years later on the Post Office terms.</p>
<p>Despite consistent growth, consistent absorption of smaller
organisations and acceptance back into the TUC and Labour Party after
the war, the union continued to be dogged by the myth of
&#8220;respectability&#8221;. Many of its older members had been recruited
from the Services and had been taught to obey commands. In rural
areas, district postmasters liked to play soldiers with their troops
and in many places postmen had actually to parade for morning
inspection!</p>
<p>As a result, the union leadership remained firmly committed to
&#8220;moderation&#8221;. Ron Smith, its general secretary for most of the
post-war period, could always be relied upon to cast his union&#8217;s
votes in favour of Labour&#8217;s &#8220;safe&#8221; right-wing leadership. The
branch rules and structure, many of which were written in the
post-war period, paid scant regard to the rights of the members to
participate in the union affairs. The Croydon branch rules, for
instance, allow for only two meetings a year! Although the structure
of the union was formally democratic (the executive is dominated by
lay members elected every year, though about a third of it consists
of full-time officials: all officials are elected on a branch
block-vote system, but, once elected, they are there for life). The
activity in the union was left in the main to a few local activists,
who often ended up in the union leadership.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, wages and conditions were gently discussed, and as
gently agreed under the paternalist aegis of the Civil Service Pay
Research Unit.</p>
<p>The cosy atmosphere was abruptly broken by the Selwyn Lloyd pay
pause of 1961. The Tory Government, desperate to control their own
pre-election boom, decided to wield the hatchet on their own workers.
Meetings were delayed, established negotiation procedures altered and
promises broken. For 18 months, postmen watched in despair as the
wages of industrial workers and white-collar workers in private
industry soared above theirs, and the official machinery which had
given them pittances year by year was ignored by the Government. By
the summer of 1964, Ron Smith had lost control of his union. In
protest against the Government&#8217;s refusal to allow them substantial
increases, the Post Office workers started an unofficial work-to-rule
and guerrilla strikes up and down the country.</p>
<p>Ron Smith and his executive were forced to call a one-day official
strike. A mass rally was held in Trafalgar Square, and, on July 26,
the Government caved in. A wage increase reckoned much later by the
Prices and Incomes Board as 15% was granted.</p>
<p>The postmen had learned a simple lesson. Their biggest increase in
post-war history had been won because some of them took the
initiative and hit the Post Office and its customers where it hurt
most &#8211; in the pocket.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards a Labour Government, trumpeting slogans about
&#8220;fairness for the workers&#8221; and &#8220;Incomes Policy&#8221;, was elected.
The Post Office workers loyally responded to the Government&#8217;s
appeals for &#8220;voluntary restraint&#8221;. Pay awards for postal and
telephonist grades in 1965 and 1966 were held strictly below the
required norms. In both years the UPW &#8220;won&#8221; 3.5% increases (<strong>PIB
Report</strong>, p.&nbsp;20). Their award in 1967 had to be delayed due to
the 1966 wage freeze, and when it was paid it was much lower than the
workers had expected &#8211; 7%., The situation was little less than
drastic, as even the Post Office recognised. The Prices and Incomes
Board Report on postal charges, published in March 1968, had this to
say:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In the view of the Post Office, the pattern of
settlements has inhibited its efforts to recruit and retain labour on
the postal side by ensuring that Post Office wages have always lagged
behind those in other occupations.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">With the cheek which characterised so many PIB reports, the Board
then recommended annual increases of 3.5%!</p>
<p>This must have been a joke, for even on the Board&#8217;s skimpy
information the Post Office workers were having it very rough indeed.
The Board found severe labour shortages in London and the Midlands
brought on by the disgracefully low wages and poor conditions.
&#8220;During the last three years&#8221;, it reported (p.&nbsp;23), &#8220;overtime
has accounted for about 20% of the Post Office&#8217;s expenditure on pay
for main postal grades. The Post Office estimate that about one-sixth
of the overtime is worked at double rates. To qualify for double
rates, postmen have to work more than 60 hours a week, indicating
that considerable numbers are working this amount&#8221;. (Sixty hours is
eight and a half hours a day <em>every day in the week</em>.) The PIB&#8217;S
remedy for this appalling situation was to increase the hiring of
part-time women workers!</p>
<p>Added to all this, and not apparently noticed by the PIB or the
Government, was the system of&#8221; incremental scales&#8221; whereby young
telephonists and postmen joining &#8220;the service&#8221; were used as
little more than cheap labour. At that time the rates of pay under
these scales were as follows:</p>

<p class="fst">The Union of Post Office Workers&#8217; leadership, meanwhile, had
taken a turn to the left with the election of Tom Jackson to the
general secretaryship in place of Ron Smith, who had inevitably
joined the Board of the British Steel Corporation as labour director.
Jackson and his executive hoped to push on with much bigger increases
for their members than had been suggested by the PIB, but very
quickly they were entangled in the &#8220;voluntary incomes policy&#8221;
which was being enforced by the Labour Government in a far from
voluntary manner. Jackson&#8217;s annual report to his union&#8217;s Jubilee
Annual Conference at Bournemouth apologised gloomily:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;To say that the year under review [ending December 31,
1968] has been a difficult one would be an understatement, either in
relation to members&#8217; difficulties, or in relation to those of
obtaining increases against the background of Government criteria
which provide substantially less than a modicum of flexibility.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">A claim for postmen had been lodged in the late summer of 1968 and
deliberately delayed at Ministerial level until late in November.
Eventually, the UPW accepted a 4% increase, 1% of which was &#8220;in
respect of measures already introduced&#8221;.</p>
<p>Tough productivity strings were bound around this unwelcome
package, which, as Jackson admitted in his report, &#8220;occasioned some
resentment and dissatisfaction&#8221;. Telephonists, still lagging even
behind postmen in pay, had been forced to accept a miserable 5.5%
plus heavy productivity concessions.</p>
<p>Neither was the following year, ended December 31, 1969, as
Jackson wrote for the union&#8217;s 1970 Conference, &#8220;one of
spectacular increases&#8221;. Under the Central Pay Claim, covering most
grades in the union, telephonists had picked up a further 7.75% in
separate negotiations, but the postmen (representing half the union)
were kept to the minimum 3.5%. Jackson and his negotiators had
accepted this further humiliation only on condition that they would
return and ask for more as soon as the Post Office became a
Corporation in October.</p>
<p>With the constitution of the Corporation, the last semblance of
civil service &#8220;paternalism&#8221; and &#8220;respectability&#8221; vanished
from the Post Office. The Board was a tough, bureaucratic business
management. The new chairman was a former merchant seaman, miner,
doctor, steelmaster and tycoon called Viscount Hall. Other Board
members included a deputy chairman of Rolls-Royce and, inevitably, a
former general secretary of the Union of Post Office Workers (duly)
knighted. The union found Lord Hall susceptible to demands for a
substantial increase to make up the ground lost over previous years.
Hall was warned that the workers were in militant mood, and demands
for industrial action to back the claim were pouring in from branches
all over the country. &#8220;Viscount Hall&#8221;, reported the <strong>Daily Mail</strong>
on December 23, 1969, &#8220;wants to avoid a strike at all costs.&#8221;
Hall duly told the Government that he had no intention of outfacing
his workers so early in the life of the Board.</p>
<p>The Labour Government, by the time they came to adjudicate on the
UPW claim in February 1970, were in a more friendly mood than they
had been for four years. The struggle against the unions, highlighted
by the White Paper <em>In Place of Strife</em> the previous summer, had
been dropped in favour of conciliation. A General Election was in the
offing. Workers&#8217; votes had to be ensured. On February 12, the
Cabinet approved the entire UPW claim, which averaged increases of
some 12%. &#8220;We got all we asked for&#8221;, said Jackson, triumphant.
(<strong>Guardian</strong>, February 13, 1970)</p>
<p>He was, however, in for a shock. On the ballot vote of the union&#8217;s
branches, acceptance of the offer was approved by the slenderest of
majorities. Among postmen, there was probably a majority for
rejection. If there had been any doubt in the minds of the union
leadership about the militancy of their members, it was now laid to
rest: The postmen, after nearly 50 years of apathy, were spoiling for
a fight to improve their wages and conditions. The increases of early
1970 had, they made it clear, compensated only marginally for the
losses in 1968 and 1969. The basic pay of the postmen was still
little more than &#0163;16 a week. Overtime was still monstrously
demanding. The incremental scales were still a scandal. A 21-year-old
telephonist outside London was still working a 41-hour, six-day week
for &#0163;10&nbsp;10s. For 20 years or more postal workers had trod
water. Now they were determined to surge forward.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Part 3. The Strike</h4>
<p class="fst">On October 29, 1970, the Union of Post Office Workers, under
instructions from their annual conference the previous spring, lodged
a claim for a wage increase of 15% or &#0163;3 a week, whichever was the
greater. The claim was only one of a number of substantial claims
submitted by unions still smarting from the long years of squeeze and
freeze, and from several months of runaway inflation which had pushed
prices up at an annual rate of 8%. Very soon, the claim was shown to
be in line with what other workers were getting. A Committee of
Inquiry under the &#8220;hard-line&#8221; negotiator Sir Jack Scamp
recommended straight increases of 15% for local government employees
who had been on strike for several weeks. The local government
workers had conducted a skilful campaign of guerrilla strikes, and
the Scamp Committee considered their claim sympathetically. Soon
afterwards, the miners, under some protest, and after only marginally
failing to give a two-thirds majority to sanction a national strike,
accepted a &#8220;no strings&#8221; offer of 12%.</p>
<p>These two increases in the public sector infuriated the
Conservative Government, not one member of whose Cabinet had less
than two former directorships or less than two houses to live in. The
Government determined to fight their own workers if necessary to the
death to bring down the general level of wage increases. To this end,
they found a useful ally in the joint-deputy chairman of the Post
Office Board, Mr. A.W.C. Ryland.</p>
<p>Ryland had worked his way up through the Post Office bureaucracy
with assiduous zeal. By 1953, he had risen to the heights of Deputy
Public Relations Officer. For 10 years he had worked exclusively on
the telecommunications side, and had learned a lot about the
profitability of telephones. In 1963, for instance, he headed the
Post Office study team to the profitable Bell Telephone System of
Canada. Ryland knew more than any other member of the Board that the
success of the Board would be assessed by one criterion:
profitability.</p>
<p>Ryland started to prepare for a possible strike in the Post Office
long before Lord Hall, or even the UPW leaders, had given it serious
consideration. In the summer of 1970, for instance, he addressed a
conference of telephone managers in Windermere in the Lake District.</p>
<p>He announced that the Prices and Incomes Board target for &#8220;return
on capital&#8221; in the telecommunications division of 84% had not been
reached. He had, he said, without explaining in detail why,
arbitrarily raised this target to 104%. There was, he went on, a need
for a thoroughgoing &#8220;drive to profitability&#8221;, and, accordingly,
there was &#8220;very little left in the kitty for wages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, the attention of Post Office managers and
supervisors was drawn by Head Office to a thereto unheard-of document
entitled: <strong>Post Office Civil Emergency Manual</strong>. The document set
out detailed proposals as to how the Post Office should work in
conditions of flood, famine, pestilence ... and industrial action.
Instructions were issued that the &#8220;drill&#8221; laid down in the
document, involving the setting up of &#8220;control centres&#8221; and &#8220;
emergency stations&#8221;, should be followed to the letter during the
power workers&#8217; work-to-rule which started on December 8 &#8211; not
because that action disrupted postal services, but &#8220;as a rehearsal
for later on&#8221;.</p>
<p>All this met with some opposition, notably from Viscount Hall.
Hall, who was enjoying himself hugely travelling round the world on
expensive &#8220;surveys&#8221; of telecommunications and postal problems,
was not at all happy about a confrontation with his workers. He took
the old-fashioned view that well-paid workers provided the best
service, and he was bold enough to tell his Minister, Mr. Christopher
Chataway, what he thought.</p>
<p>Lord Hall was intensely unpopular with the Government. Public
boards, they considered, should be chaired by obsequious Tory toadies
like Mr. Ryland. On November 24, after some intense argument about
the Board&#8217;s attitude to the UPW claim, Hall was summarily sacked by
the Government, and Ryland became &#8220;acting chairman&#8221;.</p>
<p>The sacking of Lord Hall was not lost on the postal workers. They
had no brief for Labour tycoons, but they realised the real reason
for this dismissal. To the astonishment of the Government and the
union, lightning protest strikes broke out in many large post
offices, especially in London.</p>
<p>The power workers started their work-to-rule on December 8. The
action caused instant chaos. A week later, the power men&#8217;s unions
called off the action after a promise from the Government that their
claim would be investigated by an independent court of inquiry. The
unions insisted, and the Government agreed, that the workers need not
be bound by the inquiry&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p>Watching the situation, Ryland decided to delay his reply to the
UPW claim as long as possible. If he could hold things until the
Wilberforce Commission reported on the power workers&#8217; claim, public
opinion, he reckoned, would swing towards him. But the UPW, wise to
this ruse, insisted on a reply. On January 8, the Board offered 7% &#8211; 
less than half the claim. The offer was rejected with contempt. On
January 14, the offer was increased by a wretched 1%. Once again, the
union rejected it. On January 20, the entire membership was called
out on strike.</p>
<p>Everyone, including the union leaders, was astonished at the
enthusiasm of the workers&#8217; response to the strike call. There was
no question of strike pay. The union had started a small strike fund
only three years previously. At the beginning of the strike, the fund
totalled &#0163;334,000. The most this money could finance was a &#8220;hardship
fund&#8221; for those strikers (such as single men) who had no income
while on strike. Even so, the fund could only last for a maximum of
three weeks. Yet the response among postmen was almost unanimous. The
Press, notably the <strong>Daily Express</strong> and <strong>Daily Mail</strong>,
immediately ordered all its reporters to &#8220;Hunt the Blackleg&#8221;, but
were hard put to it to find a chink in the strike. Of 100,000
postmen, less than 700 reported for work. Among telephonists, the
response was less enthusiastic. In big industrial areas, they came
out. In rural areas, where many of them were the part-time &#8220;pin
money&#8221; workers advocated by the Prices and Incomes Board, they
tended to stay at work. The <strong>Daily Bulletin</strong> run by the UPW
Headquarters reported that in cities like Dundee and Newcastle all
telephonists were on strike. The Post Office claimed from the outset
that more than a third of the total number stayed at work throughout
the strike.</p>
<p>On Day 4 of the strike, the <strong>UPW Strike Bulletin</strong> warned:
&#8220;Monday may be a crucial day in our campaign&#8221;, and urged their
members to stay out on strike. The warning was unnecessary.
Astonishingly, as the days and then the weeks went by, the strikers
became more determined and more solid. The mass meetings and rallies
throughout the country, led by a rally in Hyde Park every Thursday,
became progressively better attended and more militant.</p>
<p>On Day 9 (January 28), the <strong>Strike Bulletin</strong> sent a message from the
executive: &#8220;WE ARE PRIVILEGED TO BE YOUR ELECTED LEADERS. YOU ARE
MAGNIFICENT! KEEP IT UP! &#8221; Each bulletin recorded hundreds of
donations, most of them tiny. At this stage, the only donations from
trade unions were from individual branches. It was not until the 21st
day of the strike that the bulletin could record a donation front the
Transport and General Workers Union headquarters &#8211; of a puny &#0163;7,500
 &#8211; to the hardship fund, and not until the 31st day that SOGAT
Division &#8220;A&#8221; coughed up &#0163;10,000. Many other unions affiliated to
the TUC did not contribute at all.</p>
<p>There were other even more serious signs that the solidarity of
the leaderships of other unions was not all it was made out to be. On
Friday, February 12 (the 24th day of the strike), Mr. Johnny Nuttall,
a member of the Transport and General Workers Union in Clay Cross,
Derbyshire, reported as usual for work as a lorry-driver for a small
firm of Sheffield road hauliers called J.A. Flendersons. He was
detailed for a run to Hull and to Beverley, and he noticed that
attached to the delivery notes were two envelopes, addressed to the
firms he was to visit.</p>
<p>Such envelopes had never been part of his load before, and Mr.
Nuttall complained to the management, explaining that he could not
possibly be expected to carry letters for anyone while the postmen
were on strike. He was instantly suspended, pending negotiations. He
then contacted Mr. Ray Thorpe, the T&amp;GWU area organiser in
Nottingham. Mr. Thorpe listened to his case, spoke to the employers
and was very sympathetic to Mr. Nuttall. He was, he explained, not
convinced that this delivery was not genuinely connected with the
job. Nuttall replied that never in two and a half years had he had to
deliver such an envelope, but still Brother Thorpe was not convinced.
From his vantage point in his Nottingham office, he decided that he
was unwilling to instruct the other drivers not to work while the
employers insisted on their carrying mail. He intended, he explained,
to do nothing about it.</p>
<p>Then Tom Swain, MP, intervened. Nuttall was reinstated. Returning
to work, he found three more letters attached to the delivery notes.
Once more he refused to drive. At least nine of the 15 drivers
indicated their willingness, if instructed by the union, not to work
under such blackleg conditions. But Thorpe refused to move. Nuttall
was sacked, and the other drivers carried the mail.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I rang our regional organiser, Brother Mather, in
Birmingham&#8221;, Johnny Nuttall told me. &#8220;He took the same lukewarm
attitude as Thorpe. He kept saying that our union cared most for our
members, and that our members would be in trouble if they all did
what I did.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Johnny Nuttall has been out of work for five weeks since the
episode and his opinion of his union leadership, including Jack Jones
(his general secretary), who knew all about the incident, is not
printable.</p>
<p>What happened to Johnny Nuttall happened all over the country,
although in most places were were few lorry-drivers (or railway
workers) with Johnny Nuttall&#8217;s courage. BRS drivers carried mail
all over the country without any real effort by the T&amp;GWU to stop
the practice, in spite of all sorts of commitments by brave union
leaders at meetings in central London.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the solidarity of the postmen caused no little
consternation at the Post Office Headquarters at St.
Martin&#8217;s-le-Grand, where Ryland and his henchmen had imagined that
the trickle of postmen returning to work would rapidly turn into a
flood. Not that the Post Office itself was suffering. On the
contrary, despite the daily reports of massive Post Office losses in
the Press, the Post Office was minting huge profits during the
strike. The loss-making postal services were closed down. Only a tiny
amount was being paid out in wages. At the same time, there was a
huge increase in the highly profitable use of automatic telephones
(86% of the telephone system is on STD, which uses very little
labour). The Minister for Posts pooh-poohed suggestions that the Post
Office was making profits during the strike, but when the strike was
over the figures proved him wrong. The Post Office had lost &#0163;24.8m
in revenue, and had saved &#0163;26m in unpaid wages (<strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>,
March 5, 1971).</p>
<p>Encouraged by such figures, Ryland decided on the 18th day of the
strike to announce his plans for even bigger profits in the future.
He issued a Press statement (on February 6) indicating that, as a
result of the strike, future Post Office services would have to be
pruned. The parcel post, he warned, would have to be abolished. So
would many rural deliveries. So would the practice of delivering mail
twice a day.</p>
<p>Five months previously, Mr. Ryland had opened a new parcel sorting
office at Peterborough. He spoke in glowing terms about two new
parcel centres at Cardiff and Southampton. &#8220;We are building,&#8221; he
trumpeted, &#8220;Britain&#8217;s parcel network of the future&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, however, he was using a strike into which he had provoked his
workers as an excuse for cutting out the parcel service altogether!
Needless to say, the bitter and devastating UPW reply to Ryland&#8217;s
announcement released to the Press the next day was totally ignored
by the &#8220;objective &#8221; national newspapers.</p>
<p>Yet, for all Mr. Rvland&#8217;s dreams of still more profits (and less
service) to come, by late February the strike began to bite deep into
the pockets of industry and commerce. As the <strong>UPW Strike Bulletin</strong>
complained day by day, the real effects of the strike were blanketed
by a &#8220;conspiracy of silence&#8221;.</p>
<p>The damage was not only to banks, newspapers and mail order firms
(whose turnover had doubled in 10 years to &#0163;560m a year, and had
expanded by 10% a year compared with 3% for the rest of the retail
trade). Industry itself, and particularly industry with connections
overseas, was hard hit by the strike, and worse hit as chances of a
settlement receded. For the first two weeks, correspondence could be
put off, on the understanding that some day it would move again. But
as the strike was increasingly solid, industry became increasingly
disturbed. The Association for Small Businessmen reported that &#8220;the
strike has become a major threat to thousands of small businessmen.
Many of them are being propped up by lenient bank managers who have
extended credit to cover the strike&#8221; (<strong>Financial Times</strong>, March
3, 1971).</p>
<p>Not only small businesses but some of the bigger ones started to
warn the Government that the losses caused by the strike could not be
sustained for ever.</p>
<p>None of this appeared in the Press or on television. The myth was
bruited around that the strike was having &#8220;little effect&#8221; on
industry. The internal bulletins of the City of London (the <strong>Business
News</strong> supplements and the <strong>Financial Times</strong>) announced
blandly:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;No Problem.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The reason was that the men who run big industries and banks have
been properly brought up. One major principle has been drummed into
their heads from early childhood: <em>Never discuss</em> <em>family
problems in front of the servants.</em></p>
<p>In this instance a group of cheeky servants (Post Office workers)
were refusing to work. They had to learn that such insubordination
would do them no good, and that no one cared. Total silence about
real problems had to be scrupulously observed.</p>
<p>The union, however, was not concerned by these tricks of the
capitalist trade. The solidarity of their members was ensured. The
damage caused by the strike was indisputable. Contemptible offers
from the Post Office (such as Ryland&#8217;s suggestion that an extra 1%
in &#8220;productivity&#8221; money could be added to the 8%) could be
rejected summarily.</p>
<p>The real problem was the survival of those strikers who had no
money at all. Members covered by social security payments were likely
to stay out as long as necessary. The rent was paid, and there was
something to eat. For the others, however, the hardship fund was
crucial. And the hardship fund was running out. The hundreds of small
donations made little or no difference. The union&#8217;s own money, by
the third week in February (the fifth of the strike), had long since
been spent, as had the bankers&#8217; overdraft. The hardship fund (about
&#0163;100,000 a week) had to be sustained, or the strike would begin to
crumble. This was the union&#8217;s Achilles heel, which was promptly
pierced not by the employers or by blacklegs but by the Trades Union
Congress General Council.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Part 4. The Sell-out</h4>
<p class="fst">On Day 30 of the strike (Thursday, February 18), the union&#8217;s
<strong>Strike Bulletin</strong> reported:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;FLASH! Tom Jackson and his team have gone to the TUC
to speak to the TUC&#8217;s Finance and General Purposes Committee.&quot;</p>
<p class="fst">The result of the meeting was reported in <strong>The Times</strong> the
following day:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The UPW, in deep financial difficulties as its strike
enters the fifth week, yesterday collected &#0163;250,000 in loans from
other unions. <em>It has been promised a similar sum</em> by the TUC
next week to keep the strike alive.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">And the <strong>Guardian</strong> of February 20 carried a huge headline:</p>
<h5>TUC WILL NOT LET POSTAL UNION BE CRUSHED</h5>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Government is deeply concerned about the
apparently growing support among trade unions for the Post Office
workers.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;... TUC leaders, who met Mr. Carr for talks about the
dispute, took a courteous but firm line and left him in no doubt that
they were not going to abandon the postal workers.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;They are understood to have emphasised that they would
not stand by and see the Union of Post Office Workers crushed by
financial pressures and reminded the Minister of the loans which the
TUC was gathering from other unions on behalf of the UPW.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;The amounts have totalled &#0163;250,000 this week, <em>and
the same amount is likely to be forthcoming next week</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The following day, Sunday, February 21, 140,000 trade unionists
rallied to the call of the TUC to demonstrate against the Industrial
Relations Bill. Eight years previously, TUC general secretary George
Woodcock had told the Congress proudly that they had &#8220;long ago left
Trafalgar Square&#8221; for the committee rooms in the corridors of
power. Now the movement was back in Trafalgar Square fighting for its
very life.</p>
<p>The most popular man on the demonstration was Tom Jackson, the
most popular delegation that of the UPW. TUC general secretary Vic
Feather sought out Jackson and pulled him to the front of the plinth
to shake him by the hand. Chairman Sid Greene, the best-dressed man
in the movement, told the crowd:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The whole trade union movement is backing the UPW.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">When Jackson spoke, however, there was an element of scepticism in
his response:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If we are defeated, it will not be for lack of
resolve. It will not be for lack of guts and determination. It will
be for lack of funds.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;Sympathy we can get by the bucketful. We have the
generous wholehearted support of the public. What we need now is
money &#8211; and fast!</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;The TUC has supported the idea of workshop
collections. This is your fight. Our defeat will be your defeat. Our
victory, your victory.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;We have been forced by circumstances into the van of
the trade union movement. We did not ask for this honour, but we will
not let you down. Don&#8217;t let us down.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">This was the first sign that the TUC had supported the idea of
workshop collections. There was no sign, however, that the
collections were being enthusiastically organised by the leadership.
At any rate, such collections could not be substituted for the big
grants the union needed to keep its hardship fund going. Workshop
collections could never provide enough money fast enough.</p>
<p>A further problem dogged the UPW executive. The money collected by
the TUC the previous week had been paid in interest-free loans.</p>
<p>To some extent, this was a fiction. Many unions have rules
restraining them from making large payments outside the union. And in
many instances (though by no means in all) repayment would not in
practice be demanded. Formally, however, the money was on loan, and
the UPW&#8217;s bankers, already demanding the title deeds of the union&#8217;s
headquarters as security for its huge overdraft, were beginning to
complain about further commitments.</p>
<p>The crucial meeting of the strike was that of the General Council
of the TUC on Wednesday, February 24. All that week, the newspapers
had been full of the TUC support for Jackson and the TUC&#8217;s
determination not to allow a defeat of the postmen.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Tom Jackson spelt out his dilemma. The TUC must
back their pledges of support and their rhetoric with cash, or the
strike would crumble. There were, he said, hopeful signs. Employment
Secretary Robert Carr had been visited by the mail order firms, the
Association of Small Businesses and by the Confederation of British
Industry, all of whom were pressing for an end to the strike, which
was rapidly becoming intolerable.</p>
<p>To Jackson&#8217;s horror and astonishment, his colleagues on the
General Council started to mumble about &#8220;problems and
difficulties&#8221;. There was, they said, no money available by way of
grant. They might be able to rustle up another &#0163;100,000 in
interest-free loans. Jackson told them again that further loans would
not be allowed by his bankers, and reminded them again of their
commitment the previous week to a further &#0163;250,000. Even &#0163;100,000
grant could keep him going another crucial week. The heroes of
Trafalgar Square the previous Sunday fell silent. The mighty
militants had turned into mice. A hundred thousand pounds in loans
out of the millions of union funds and tens of millions in union
investments was all they could afford.</p>
<p>When Jackson left the TUC that morning, he must have known that
the game was up. He could not continue the hardship fund the
following week without selling his union headquarters. The following
day, the UPW rally in Hyde Park was the biggest yet, swelled by tens
of thousands of Post Office Engineering Workers who had staged a
token strike in solidarity with the UPW. Jackson kept a brave face,
as though nothing serious had happened. And the demonstrators went
home confident that their struggle would continue.</p>
<p>The axe, however, fell fast. On Monday, as news of the end of the
hardship money filtered through, the numbers returning to work
increased sharply (though still only a tiny minority of the total).</p>
<p>By Tuesday, Jackson was outlining his line of retreat to the
executive. On Wednesday (March 3) the entire executive, having agreed
to surrender by 27 votes to four (with the Communists on the
executive supporting Jackson), travelled to the Department of
Employment and concocted a formula for calling off the strike. A
&#8220;committee of inquiry&#8221;, they agreed, would look into the Post
Office claims. The three-man committee would consist of one nominee
from the union, one from the management and a chairman agreeable to
both. The chairman would have the right, in the event of
disagreement, to impose a settlement. In sharp contrast to the
setting up of the Scamp Committee of Inquiry into the &#8220;dirty jobs&#8221;
strike, the union would recommend an immediate return to work before
the committee was even constituted. Unlike those of the Wilberforce
Committee, this committee&#8217;s findings would be binding. This was
marginally different from the arbitration which Jackson had been
refusing for 10 weeks. But no one had any doubt that the Post Office
would have settled for such an inquiry in the first week of the
strike.</p>
<p>The rally on Thursday, March 4, was a very different affair from
its predecessors. Many postal workers could not believe their ears,
and shouted their disillusionment at their leaders. As the executive
recommendations went to the ballot, branch after branch recorded the
dismay and militancy of the rank and file. In almost every urban
branch, there was a substantial vote against the executive proposals,
and in some branches the majority voted to stay out. A mass meeting
of more than 2,500 UPW members in Liverpool, for instance, voted two
to one against going back to work.</p>
<p>The real blame for the collapse of the strike must be placed on
the TUC General Council, first for not providing the funds when they
were needed, and secondly for not organising the other unions in
dispute with the Government to co-ordinate their efforts with the
postmen. The railwaymen&#8217;s and the teachers&#8217; union leaders knew
well enough that the defeat of the postmen would lead to
substantially smaller settlements for their members. Why then did
they not hasten their negotiations, and join the fray? Why at least
did they not press for the necessary funds to be made available? Why
did not the more militant trade union leaders, notably Jack Jones of
the T&amp;GWU or Hugh Scanlon of the AUEW, openly break from the
General Council line and make available the funds which they could so
well afford?</p>
<p>Above all, why did the General Council retreat from a position
which it seemed to have occupied in some strength?</p>
<p>The answer was half-available to readers of the South Wales
morning paper, the <strong>Western Mail</strong>, on Friday, March 5,
headed:</p>
<h5>POST PACT KEY FOR TORY UNIONS DEAL</h5>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The virtual collapse of the postmen&#8217;s strike&#8221;,
wrote George Gardiner, that paper&#8217;s Lobby Correspondent, &#8220;has
opened the way for a new deal between the Government and the unions.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;If the TUC is willing to support the principle that in
future all unions in dispute should go to arbitration, before
considering strike action, I understand the Government is prepared to
amend its Industrial Relations Bill when it comes back to the Commons
on Monday week.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The parts of the Industrial Relations Bill which most offended the
bureaucrats on the General Council were not those which penalised
unofficial strikers, nor those which outlawed sympathy strikes, but
those which restricted the closed shop. These restrictions, the
leaders feared, would cut off important funds to the unions. The
weaker unions like USDAW and the G&amp;MWU would lose tens of
thousands of members presently kept in union membership by closed
shop provisions, often with the agreement of employers. At all costs,
the General Council wanted Clause 5 (about closed shops) altered. The
Government had made it plain that they might make concessions on
Clause 5 if the TUC would restrain its members from going on strike.</p>
<p>For some time, Vic Feather had been seeking a meeting with the
Prime Minister to discuss such a deal as well as other matters like
unemployment. The <strong>Daily Mirror</strong> on March 2 ran a front-page
article entitled <em>End This Angry Silence</em>, in which it attacked
the Prime Minister and the unions for not &#8220;getting together&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Tory Government was dangling possible changes in the
Industrial Relations Bill as a carrot to prompt the TUC to immediate
action on the postal workers&#8217; strike. What was the point, Heath&#8217;s
representatives asked Feather, in talking about the TUC restraining
strikes at a time when one of the biggest unions in the country was
&#8220;paralysing the nation&#8221; by refusing arbitration? Only if the post
strike was stopped on terms of arbitration would the Government talk
to the TUC.</p>
<p>These arguments carried much weight with the &#8220;committee room&#8221;
bureaucrats in the TUC who had resented not being asked to Downing
Street since the Tory Government was elected. Here at last was a
chance to get into a committee room with the Government again. With
such a prize, who cared about Tom Jackson and his Post Office
workers?</p>
<p>Indeed, the more crusted of the General Council reactionaries
welcomed an excuse to sell the postmen down the river. They were
terrified by the prospect not of the postmen&#8217;s defeat, but of their
victory. For if the postmen&#8217;s strike had forced the Government to
concede substantial wage claims, what fantastic class forces would be
unleashed in all the other unions? How would the diehards in the
General Council hope in such circumstances to exert the &#8220;control&#8221;
over their members to which they had become accustomed? How would
they be able to stop them from engaging in open conflict with the
Government, the employers &#8211; who knows, the whole structure of
society? Such thoughts struck terror into the kind hearts and
coronets who make up the TUC General Council. And when the Government
issued its ultimatum: <em>No talks while the postal strike is on,</em>
the mind of the General Council was rapidly made up. Tom Jackson and
his 200,000 postal workers would have to go to the wall.</p>
<p>They could rely on Jackson not to expose their double-dealing. At
no time after the fateful meeting on February 24 did Jackson openly
attack the General Council or any member of it for knifing his union
in the back. An open appeal to the rank and file of the unions, with
the real facts of the sell-out thoroughly exposed, would have won for
Jackson, if not the necessary funds, at any rate the continued
support of his rank and file. Yet Jackson chose to keep mum, to take
the blame for the decision, and to retain his seat and his friends on
the General Council. The despair and disillusionment of his members
is so much the worse for his failure properly to explain to them the
real reasons for the strike&#8217;s collapse.</p>
<p>On the evening of March 3, several hours after the UPW executive
had gone to the Department of Employment to lick the boots of Mr.
Ryland and Mr. Carr, Mr. Victor Feather blandly called a press
conference at Congress House. He had, he said, sent a letter for
delivery to 10 Downing Street asking Mr. Heath for &#8220;early talks
between the Government and the TUC on the worsening economic
situation&#8221;.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Previously&#8221;, wrote the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>
Industrial Correspondent the next day (March 4), &#8220;the TUC has
offered to discuss wage restraint if the Government would first
undertake to drop the <em>Industrial Relations Bill</em>. Now, although
killing the Bill remains the TUC&#8217;s hope, it is no longer adopting
such a rigid approach which would make fruitful discussions virtually
impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The reply from Downing Street was almost instantaneous. Mr. Heath
paused only to discover from his Minister of Employment that the post
strike was all but over. He then picked up the telephone, got through
to Congress House and courteously assured Mr. Feather that he was
only too willing to talk to the General Council.</p>
<p>The following morning the front page of the <strong>Daily Mirror</strong>
carried two headlines. &#8220;POST STRIKE IS OVER&#8221;, it shouted, and
then, next door, in smaller type: &#8220;HEATH BREAKS THE ANGRY SILENCE&#8221;.</p>
<p>Peter Jenkins of the <strong>Guardian</strong> is by no stretch of the
imagination a revolutionary socialist. He is, however, in close touch
with Tom Jackson, and he knew what had gone on at the General
Council.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The trade union movement&#8221;, he wrote on March 4,
&#8220;made warlike noises. It edged towards a confrontation with the
Government; but when it came to the point, it at once thought better
of it and quickly drew back. The trade union movement was shown to be
lacking not only in will but also totally in strategic sense. The
lessons of that unedifying spectacle will not be lost on other trade
unions, on public opinion or on the Government.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Part 5. The Lessons</h4>
<p class="fst">The immediate effects of the collapse of the post strike will be
felt by other workers in the public sector, such as railwaymen and
teachers. Union leaders who allowed the Government to take on the
postal workers in an isolated struggle are now using the defeat as an
excuse to lumber their own members with wage increases that will not
keep up with rises in the cost of living. The rank and file in these
unions must make sure that the postal workers&#8217; strike is the last
in which the Government divides and rules in this way. They should
demand the building up of a &#8220;Public Sector Alliance&#8221; of different
unions to wage a unified fight back.</p>
<p>For postmen, the immediate results of the collapse will be even
more serious. Whatever is gained or lost at the committee of inquiry,
Ryland (who must surely be promoted as Post Office chairman) will
seek to use the strike&#8217;s aftermath to cut down on postal services
(and workers). His eyes are fixed on Sweden, allegedly the home of
&#8220;progress&#8221; and the &#8220;Welfare State&#8221;, where postal services
have been progressively slashed over the past decade. There is only
one postal delivery outside the commercial centre of Stockholm. Rural
deliveries and collections have been cut back to almost nothing. No
parcels are delivered. Meanwhile, the telephone service is expanding
at a rapid rate and making huge profits for the firms which feed off
it.</p>
<p>All Ryland&#8217;s statement&#8217;s during and after the strike commit
him to a Swedish policy which could mean massive redundancies among
postmen, quite apart from the slashing of the &#8220;public service&#8221;,
especially to those (the majority) who cannot afford telephones.</p>
<p>For the trade union movement in general, the Post Office dispute
is a major setback. An arrogant and offensive Government, composed
entirely of wealthy businessmen, will now attempt to ride roughshod
over the demands of workers elsewhere.</p>
<p>They will not find it easy. The TUC General Council sell-out of
the postmen can be compared in its cynicism to their sell-out of the
miners in 1926, but the General Strike of that year was the last gasp
of a working class locked out and bullied for half a decade. Today,
the strength of the workers&#8217; anger is much more powerful. The
refusal among workers to be pushed around by the wealthy is stronger
now than ever before in history. The Government, in spite of its
victory over the Post Office workers, will not find the workers
submissive to a class assault of the type which they are
contemplating. The spirit of postmen, and of workers everywhere, is
far from broken.</p>
<p>How can that spirit be preserved, and expanded? Certainly not, as
the post strike shows, by &#8220;leaving it to the executive&#8221; or, even
less, &#8220;leaving it to the General Council&#8221;. Rank-and-file postmen
have learned the hard way how trade union leaders, when it comes to
the crunch, are prepared to make squalid deals even with reactionary
Governments in order to &#8220;pacify&#8221; their own members. The Union of
Post Office Workers&#8217; Conference at Bournemouth this spring will be
a lively affair, and already branch rules throughout the country are
being re-written to allow more participation and control by the rank
and file.</p>
<p>There is a more attractive doctrine, however, which has also been
exposed by the post strike. In the four years from 1966 &#8211; 70 during
which a Labour Government carried out policies of which any Tory
Government would have been proud, many workers lost hope in politics,
or political solutions. They have imagined since that militancy and
solidarity in their unions will be enough to win their battles. Any
attempt to link their strike with the struggles of workers elsewhere,
in Britain or in the world, has been suspected as politics, which has
become in many workers&#8217; minds another word for opportunism or
careerism.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, the assault on the workers, as the post
strike so clearly proves, is becoming more and more political. The
tiny group of rich and powerful men who control industry and property
are determined to defend their class superiority from incessant
demands by the workers. <em>They</em> have organised politically,
through their representatives in the Conservative Party, to pick off
each group of workers, isolate them, humiliate them and break their
spirit. <em>Their</em> struggle is not isolated in individual
industries or factories. <em>They</em> operate as a tightly-knit group
of politically motivated men. And the fight against their operations
cannot be won by isolated acts of militancy, however prolonged and
however heroic.</p>
<p>The reaction from workers, if it is ever to succeed, must also be
political. That does not mean voting every five years for a Labour
candidate. It means linking different struggles, and pointing out the
common enemy in each of them. It means binding the fight in this
country with similar fights abroad. It means mobilising people into a
permanent political counter-offensive against the Tories and the
class they represent.</p>
<p>For more than 25 years workers have been told by their political
representatives that the capitalist system works and that all that
matters is to work it efficiently. Now, after 25 years of full
employment and capitalist expansion, the system is as decadent, as
corrupt, as unfair, as violent, as ridiculous and contemptible as it
ever was. The humiliation of the postmen and the part played in it by
the TUC General Council is only a start. Things will get worse for
the workers unless they can build for themselves a new political
instrument capable of breaking through the thin crust of contemporary
capitalism and creating a society where the wealth which workers
produce is used for them, not against them.</p>
