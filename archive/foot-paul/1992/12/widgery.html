<p class="fst">I doubt if the Socialist Workers Party will ever put on a better memorial meeting than the one held last Friday in celebration of the restless, bustling and inspiring life of Dave Widgery.</p>

<p>The chief problem for the organisers was the enormous range of Dave&#8217;s interests, friends, heroes and admirers.</p>

<p>There was no problem about his commitment to the Socialist Workers Party. I first met Dave in the middle of the 1968 &#8216;revolution&#8217; on York station. He had come from speaking at the university which he denounced, his eyes shining, as a &#8216;great middle class fun palace&#8217;. He glowered at me. &#8216;They don&#8217;t need you there at all. They need the proletariat.&#8217;</p>

<p>Even when he used an old fashioned word like proletariat he had a way of making it sound ultra-modern, like something from the lyrics of a popular rock band. And in his last book (and his best, by the way, in case anyone thinks that revolutionaries get stale as they get older), <strong>Some Lives!</strong>, he used the word &#8216;proletarian&#8217; quite naturally again and again.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Knew better</h4>

<p class="fst">Dave was a party man. He loved and admired Peter Sedgwick, and had a lot in common with him. But when Peter finally dropped out of the International Socialists (forerunner of the SWP) some time in the mid-1970s, Dave would not let him go without a ferocious argument.</p>

<p>Dave knew better than most of his friends and contemporaries that you cannot be a socialist on your own.</p>

<p>Dave was all those things which so many of his 1968 generation ended up denouncing. He was a Leninist and a vanguardist. He was not in the SWP because it was the &#8216;best of the bunch&#8217; or because he &#8216;had to be in something&#8217; (two explanations I&#8217;ve heard for his commitment). Nor even was his reason for membership his agreement with the basic policies which distinguished the SWP from other left organisations.</p>

<p>The chief reason was that he agreed with the sort of party the SWP was trying to build.</p>

<p><strong>Socialist Worker</strong> editor Chris Harman&#8217;s speech last Friday ended with a sharp attack on the left paper <strong>Tribune</strong> for a sectarian assault on an obituary in <strong>Socialist Review</strong>. &#8216;He didn&#8217;t sell enough papers,&#8217; scoffed <strong>Tribune</strong>.</p>

<p>In fact there are few people alive today who have sold more copies of <strong>Socialist Worker</strong> (over 25 years, remember&#8212;Dave was at the very first <strong>Socialist Worker</strong> editorial board meeting in 1967). He knew that if socialist papers are not sold directly, hand to hand, they do not sell at all (<strong>Tribune</strong> I cite as an example).</p>

<p>The majority of the speakers last Friday were not members of the SWP. Sheila Rowbotham spoke of Dave&#8217;s abiding solidarity with the women&#8217;s and gay liberation movements. Anna Livingstone, a fellow doctor in the East End, enthused us with her stories of Dave&#8217;s battle for the health of the working class.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>In particular</h4>

<p class="fst">After a moving and quite brilliant speech which reminded me of his, my, and Dave&#8217;s hero C.L.R. James, Darcus Howe ended by saying he had fathered five children in Britain.</p>

<p>Four, he said, had grown up black and angry, battling all the time against the awful racism around them. The fifth, he said, grew up &#8216;black at ease&#8217;. She had &#8216;space&#8217; to develop her own personality.</p>

<p>Darcus ascribed this &#8216;space&#8217; to the work of the Anti Nazi League in general and Rock Against Racism and Dave Widgery in particular. There could not have been a more powerful tribute to this firecracker of a revolutionary whom we have lost far too soon.</p>
