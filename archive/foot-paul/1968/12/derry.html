<p class="fst">THE DEMONSTRATIONS which have erupted in Northern Ireland and which, in spite of the sacking of Home Secretary Craig, will almost certainly continue, started in Londonderry, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s second city.</p>

<p>Derry&rsquo;s predicament sums up the &lsquo;divide and rule&rsquo; policy of the Unionist government.</p>

<p>Here are some of the facts about the city which cannot be found in government handouts.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Sub-Standard</h4>

<p class="fst"><B>Housing.</B> There are approximately 12.000 houses in the city, 40 per cent of which are sub-standard.</p>

<p>According to the 1961 census, 45 per cent of the households in the city do not have sole use of hot water; 54 per cent do not have a bath; 16 per cent do not have a kitchen sink.</p>

<p>About 1,250 households are in &lsquo;multiple occupation&rsquo;, sharing household amenities.</p>

<p>The Derry Housing Association has seven volumes, incorporating some 1,410 documents of cases of &lsquo;intolerable&rsquo; housing conditions. And these are all Catholics.</p>

<p>To these have to be added at least another 300 households in the Protestant areas of The Fountain and Waterside, where conditions are no better than in the Catholic slums.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Overcrowding</h4>

<p class="fst">In 1966,the city&rsquo;s Medical Officer of Health,who is President of the Apprentice Boys, a high-powered Masonic-type organisation named after the boys who closed the Derry gates against the invading armies in 1688, reported: &lsquo;Overcrowding plays a .arge part in the causation of tuberculosis in the area.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst"><B>House-building:</B> The Derry Corporation, which is Unionist-controlled, built no houses in 1967. The following table speaks for itself:</P>

<p class="fst">The rate of house-building in Derry (70 houses per 1,000 people) since the war is the slowest of any housing authority in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s including the effort of the government-sponsored Northern Ireland Housing Trust,which has done most of the house-building in Derry since 1958.</p>

<p>The vote is only available in local elections to ratepayers, that is, householders in separate dwellings. More than a quarter of the adults in Derry (8,400 people) cannot vote.</p>

<p>There are three wards: South, North and Waterside.</p>

<p>Half the Derry people live in South ward. Nearly all of them are Catholics, who vote eight Nationalists on to the Corporation.</p>

<p>In North and Waterside there are small Protestant majorities, who return 12 Unionists. Protestants make up about 25 per cent of the Derry population, but their party controls the Corporation.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Turned Down</h4>

<p class="fst">This delicate balance controls the Corporation&rsquo;s housing policy.</p>

<p>A proposal by Derry Housing Association to build 450 houses in Pennyburn was turned down &ndash; for fear of rehousing Catholics in a Protestant area.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Protestant slum-dwellers must stay where they are. To move them out to council houses would mean losing valuable votes.</p>

<p>Everything is neatly carved up and Unionists and Nationalists don&rsquo;t bother to fight elections.</p>

<p>Elections don&rsquo;t happen, unless,like last year, for the first time, the Northern Ireland Labour Party intervenes, getting about 30 per cent of the vote in Catholic and Protestant wards.</p>

<p>Unemployment is 12.5 per cent in Derry. 17.4 per cent of males are out of work.</p>

<p>Unemployment in Northern Ireland depends very much on the religious nature of the area.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>High and Low</h4>

<p class="fst">Derry is Catholic &ndash; so unemployment is high. Belfast is Protestant &ndash; so unemployment is relatively low:</p>
