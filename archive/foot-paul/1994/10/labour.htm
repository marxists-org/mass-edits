<li>Labour, which is linked to organised workers, is better at any time than the Tories, who are linked to organised capital.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>&#8216;Without struggle there is no progress&#8217;: everything worth winning by the workers and the dispossessed has to be fought for.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The less Labour fights the Tories, the less it is likely to beat them at the polls or anywhere else.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The more Labour compromises and prevaricates, the more the fighting spirit of the people who vote Labour is dampened.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The more that fighting spirit is dampened, the stronger and more confident grow employers, racialists and reactionaries of every description.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The power of the elected parliament is all the time frustrated by the power of the undemocratic banks, corporations, judges and the media.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The more a Labour government tries to be fair to the banks, corporations, judges or media, the more it becomes their captive.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The more it becomes their captive, the more it attacks the people who vote Labour, thus ensuring a Labour defeat next time.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>This vicious circle is written into the history of the whole century. Clement Attlee and Harold Wilson couldn&#8217;t avoid it. There&#8217;s no chance that Blair and Co, further to the right even than Attlee and Wilson, will avoid it either.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>(Conclusion) Vote Labour, but keep up the fight down below to build the resistance into a force which is strong enough to dictate to the undemocratic elite at the top of society &#8211; and put an end to their interminable dictatorship.</li>
