<p><strong>Letter to the Editors :  Reply to H. Osborne</strong></p>

<p>Capitalism to-day extends over the major portion of the habitable globe, and includes practically all those territories usually termed "nations." Hence it is international.</p>

<p>Capitalism is controlled by the capitalist class. The establishment of Socialism is the historic mission of the working class; but Socialism can only be established by abolishing capitalism. From this it follows that the interests of the capitalist class are in direct opposition to those of the working class. These two classes, as classes, have no national boundaries&#8212;not only because they exist wherever capitalism reigns, but also because both capitalists and workers wander all over the globe, the one in search of profits, the other in search of a living, through the medium of work. </p>

<p>To establish Socialism the working class have to wrest power from the capitalist class, and therefore the fight for Socialism, and its establishment, must be international.</p>

<p>The I.L.P. is not a Socialist organisation. Its leaders deny the existence of the class struggle outlined above, and, being anxious to retain capitalism under the "State" form by municipalising and nationalising the various industries, they merely extend the error of their fundamental misconceptions when they add the stupid statement that Socialism could be established in one country alone. </p>
