Capital, Vygodsky,
1975</p>
<h3>PART I HOW KARL MARX WORKED</h3>
<p>Marx
left a vast body of work on economic
questions. It includes numerous notebooks containing excerpts from
books on
political economy, drafts of several versions of <i>Capital</i>,
<i>Capital</i>
itself, and his letters to Engels and many other correspondents. All
these
documents (many of them still unpublished and kept in archives) are
studied
with great care by scholars in many countries. This exhaustive work is
necessary because only Marx's economic legacy in its entirety can give
people a
correct and comprehensive idea of Marxist economic theory. Thorough
study of
the history of <i>Capital</i> is needed in order to master
its ideas creatively
and to be able to apply them in explaining contemporary economic
processes.
Understanding of Marx's creative method is necessary and highly
instructive.
Marx's exceptional scientific scrupulousness, the extensive material he
used,
his profound analysis of the material impress us as they did Marx's
contemporaries a century ago. And more than that; it also teaches us a
lot.</p>
<p>Marxist
economic theory was not developed
overnight. Marx devoted forty years of untiring, concentrated effort to
the
writing of <i>Capital</i>. He started the work in 1843 and
continued it
literally to the last day of his life. Every advance Marx made in
comprehending
the laws of social development cost him a tremendous effort, involving
a
colossal exertion of mental and physical powers. Every theoretical
discovery,
every page of the manuscript written to make a question clear in his
own mind (as
Marx liked to say) represent mountains of books, poured over and
studied, piles
of notes, hours, days, months and years of concentrated thought. Was
such
meticulous work over so many years necessary? Here is how Engels
answered this
question: "In all ... scientific researches which encompass such a wide
area and such a mass of material it is only possible to achieve
something
worthwhile through years-long endeavour," he wrote in 1883, after
Marx's
death. "New and correct points of view on separate questions... suggest
themselves more readily; but to comprehend the whole and organise it on
new
lines is only possible when one has exhausted it. Otherwise books like <i>Capital</i>
would have been much more numerous." <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[5]</a></p>
<p>The
present book does not aim to give a
detailed account of the forty-year-long history of the writing of <i>Capital</i>.
But you will learn of certain phases in its creation and catch a
glimpse of how
Marx worked.</p>
<h2>1. In Quest of a "Prime
Mover" (1843-44)</h2>
<p>When
we study Marx's method of work we are
immediately struck by his determination to extract everything from
every
available source of material he is studying. Engels wrote, rather
reproachfully, to Marx, concerning delays in the publication of <i>Capital</i>:
" ... but I also know that the reason for the delay is always your own
meticulousness." <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[6]</a>
This tremendous sense of scientific responsibility resulted from Marx's
desire
to penetrate to the core of a subject, to create a theory which would
reflect
as exactly as possible the fundamental tendencies of society's
development.</p>
<p>The
desire to obtain a fundamental
knowledge of things was characteristic of Marx since his youth. From
law, which
he studied at Bonn and Berlin universities, he soon went on to
philosophy and
to its summit - Hegel. At 19, Marx wrote, "... and it again became
plain
to me that I could not get by without philosophy." <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[7]</a>
Hegelian
philosophy equipped Marx with a powerful tool: the dialectical method.
Five
years later Marx began to contribute to the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i>
and then
became an editor of that newspaper of the radical bourgeoisie, which
was in
opposition to the Prussian bourgeois state.</p>
<p>When
he started working for the <i>Rheinische
Zeitung</i>, Marx still shared the idealistic Hegelian view of
the state as a
factor determining social development. But a debate soon flared up in
the
Rheinische Landtag on the law on thefts of wood and the fragmentation
of landed
property giving Marx his first introduction to social problems. He saw
quite
clearly that the state acted on behalf of the property-owners and that
legislation instead of regulating social relations served as their tool
- the
tool of private interest. Therefore, as Marx defended the poor peasants
against
the landlords' oppression and came out on behalf of the Moselle
peasants
against the government from the standpoint of Hegelian philosophy,
using moral
and legal rather than social and economic arguments, his criticism of
the
Prussian state lacked conviction. Marx was aware of this himself. But
the tense
day-to-clay political struggle against the Prussian government that
Marx
carried on in the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i> pushed him,
little by little,
towards materialism, making him aware of the decisive role played by
economic
and social relations in the formation of law, society and the state. He
wrote
in the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i> in the middle of 1842:
"But philosophers
do not grow out of the earth like mushrooms; they are the fruit of
their time,
of their people... The same spirit that builds philosophical systems in
the
brain of the philosophers builds railroads by the hands of the workers.
"<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[8]</a>
Here Marx
draws a highly interesting parallel between economic progress and
development
of
philosophy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Particular
attention must be paid to Marx's
introduction to Utopian socialism and communism, which took place when
he was
working for the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i>. On reading the
works of Proudhon, Dézamy, Leroux and Considerant, Marx came to
a highly important conclusion about the Utopian nature of their views
and
stated the need for the theoretical development of communist ideas. <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[9]</a>
All of
Marx's subsequent activities were, in effect, devoted to that task,
i.e., to
transforming Utopian socialism into scientific socialism. The first
step Marx
took in that direction was to overcome Hegel's idealistic conception of
the
state and give a theoretical basis to the conclusions to which he had
come when
working for the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i>. His major
conclusion was that the
state itself is the instrument of objectively existing socio-economic
relations.</p>
<p>The
amount of work done by Marx in
connection with his critique of Hegel's philosophy of law is truly
staggering.
Once he doubted Hegel's idealistic view of the relationship between
state and
society, Marx began to look for the true correlation between them. For
this
purpose he went in the summer of 1843 to the town of Kreuznach, where
he stayed
alone till the end of October.</p>
<p>Marx
examined a stupendous amount of
historical material. He studied the history and state and social
structure of
France, Britain, Germany, the United States, Italy and Sweden, the
French
bourgeois revolution in the late 18th century, works by French, German,
English
and Italian historians, philosophers and statesmen. During July and
August 1843
Marx filled five notebooks, subsequently called <i>Kreuznacher
Exzerpte</i>,
with excerpts from these works. He concentrated his attention mainly on
feudal
property and its influence on the class and political structure of
society.
Marx's historical research conducted at Kreuznach provided the basis on
which
he "turned" Hegel's idealistic conception of the state and law
"inside out." This was also done in the summer of 1843, in the
manuscript <i>A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's
Philosophy of Law</i>
(unfortunately only parts of this wonderful manuscript have been
preserved).</p>
<p>Marx
examines and criticises Hegel's
philosophy of law on the strength of a concrete analysis of historical
development and political and social relationships between bourgeois
society
and the bourgeois stale. He clearly stated his own conception of the
connection
between the state and the "civil society," i.e., the totality of
material social relations, the relations of property above all. "The
family and civil society are the prerequisites of the state.... They
are the
driving force. By Hegel, they are, on the contrary, made by the real
idea," <a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[10]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Late in October 1943 Marx
moved to Paris where he was to take part in editing a review, the <i>Deutsch-Franzosische
Jahrbucher</i> (German-French Yearbook) of which, however, only
one number
appeared. This was a double issue, which came out in February 1844. It
contained two articles by Marx reflecting the results of his study of
"civil society," of social relationships, which he undertook directly
after his criticism of Hegel's philosophy of
law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Marx's knowledge of the
Paris proletariat and its revolutionary traditions and generally of the
French
bourgeois society of 1789 and 1830 and its class antagonisms was put to
use.
"But the system of profit and commerce, of property and human
exploitation
leads ... to a rift inside contemporary society that the old society is
incapable of healing ..."<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[11]</a>
Such is the first but profound Marxist description of bourgeois
society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But
how can the rift inside bourgeois
society be overcome? Can it be overcome by criticising society? Marx
thought so
and set great store by such criticism. He writes: "I mean the <i>reckless
critique of all that exists</i> ..." At the same time he insists
on
linking criticism with party politics and identifying it "with <i>real</i>
battles." He writes further: "It is clear that the arm of criticism
cannot replace the criticism of arms. Material force can only be
overthrown by
material force; but theory itself becomes a material force when it has
seized
the masses." <a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[12]</a>
Marx thus arrived at the idea (which, up to then, he expressed in
general
philosophical form) that to abolish capitalist exploitation a social
revolution
was necessary. </p>
<p>So,
in the chaos of fast-flowing human
events Marx found the "prime mover" of human society, viz. material
social relations, property relations. Therefore, the analysis of the
basis of
capitalist society, of the capitalist system of economy became the
paramount
task for Marx. His first, and highly fruitful, attempt at such analysis
Marx
made as early as 1844, in his famous <i>Economic and Philosophic
Manuscripts of
1844</i>.</p>
<p>Marx
was considerably influenced by <i>Outlines
of a Critique of Political Economy</i> by Engels, published in
February 1844.
It was the first attempt at a scientific analysis of capitalist economy
and
scientific criticism of bourgeois political economy from the standpoint
of the
revolutionary working class. For the first time Engels raised the
question as
to whether capitalist private ownership was justifiable. In his <i>Economic
and
Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844</i> Marx also expounds the thesis
that private
property is not an eternal but historically transient phenomenon and
must be
abolished. But first of all Marx defined the "prime mover" he had
found, stating the primacy, i.e. , the pre-eminent importance of
material
production for human society. "Religion, family, state, law, morality,
science, art, etc. ," he wrote, "are only <i>particular</i>
modes of
production, and fall under its general law." <a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[13]</a></p>
<p>His
study of capitalist production as it
was in his own day showed Marx that it was based on the exploitation of
the
worker by the capitalist, the system of wage-labour, which enabled the
capitalist to appropriate a part of the products created by the worker.
Here
lies the source of capitalist profit. Pre-Marxian socialists said that
this
appropriation was illegitimate, that capital was a shameless swindle
with
regard to the worker, and wanted capitalist profit to be abolished
without,
however, changing capitalist production in any way. They did not
understand
that profit in capitalist society was the mainspring of production.
Pre-Marxian
socialists were Utopians, their views were in contradiction with actual
reality, and that was why their attempts to reform bourgeois society
had
utterly failed. Nevertheless, evaluating their contribution towards
tackling
social problems, Engels wrote that theoretical communism "... will
never
forget that it rests on the shoulders of Saint-Simon, Fourier and
Owen&#8212;three
men who, in spite of all their fantastic notions and all their
Utopianism,
stand among the most eminent thinkers of all time and whose genius
anticipated
innumerable things the correctness of which is now being scientifically
proved
by us ..." <a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[14]</a>
Utopian socialism, in Lenin's words, criticised capitalist society, it
condemned and damned it, it dreamed of its destruction, it had visions
of a
better order and endeavoured to convince the rich of the immorality of
exploitation." <a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[15]</a></p>
<p>The
Utopian socialists exposed many evils
of bourgeois society. They insisted on the need for abolishing
antagonistic
social relationships and for establishing a different kind of society
in which
all men would be equal and no exploitation of man by man would exist.
Although they
were forerunners of scientific socialism, they still failed to analyse
the
essence of wage-slavery under capitalism, or to discover the laws
governing the
development of capitalism, or point out the social force capable of
building
the new society.</p>
<p>Marx's
approach was entirely different.
From the start, he set out to explain the natural process - "natural"
to capitalist society of course - of exploitation of the worker by the
capitalist, defining it as "the expression of a necessary course of
development."<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[16]</a></p>
<p>This
at once put the theory Marx was
working out on a strictly scientific basis.</p>
<p>The
chief problem to be elucidated in
studying the process of capitalist exploitation is, in Marx's view,
that the
product of labour belongs to the capitalist, not to the worker, who
regards it
as an alien object. Thus the product of labour is alienated from
labour. It
must be said at once that at that stage of his research Marx merely
approached
the solution of this problem which is indeed all-important to the study
of
capitalist exploitation. Yet, raising it was itself an indication of
the
fundamental shift of emphasis in the development of scientific
socialism.</p>
<p>In
full conformity with the principle of
the primacy of material production, Marx arrives at the conclusion that
in
order to explain the estrangement or alienation of the products of
labour from
the worker, one must go deeper into the process of production and
scrutinise
the relations which [take? SP] shape between the worker and the
products, the
worker and the objects of his production, because it is the
relationship
between the worker and production that underlies the labour relations
in
capitalist society. Thus Marx proceeds from his study of the alienation
of the
products of labour to the study of labour itself. The specific nature
of labour
under capitalism is described by Marx as alienation or self-alienation
of labour.
(Marx uses <i>self-alienation</i> as distinct from <i>alienation</i>
to
emphasise that the estrangement is the result of the worker's labour
activity
proper, that the source of estrangement is inside, not outside
production.)</p>
<p>Marx
writes in <i>Economic and Philosophic
Manuscripts of 1844</i>: "But the estrangement is manifested not
only in
the result but in the <i>act of production</i>, within the
<i>producing
activity</i>, itself ... In the estrangement of the object of
labour is merely
summarised the estrangement, the alienation, in the activity of labour
itself." <a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[17]</a></p>
<p>Describing
self-alienation of labour in
bourgeois society, Marx points out that the worker's labour is not
voluntary,
but coerced; it is forced labour. Neither the worker in the act of
production
nor his labour itself belong to him. The worker's activity, says Marx,
is not
his spontaneous activity. Further. his activity is for the worker only
a means
to enable him to exist, which involves a gross impoverishment of human
life.
Both nature surrounding man and his spiritual aspect are alienated from
him.
Refinement of the requirements of the ruling class and of the, means to
satisfy
them gives rise to utterly gross simplification of the requirements of
the
working people. Lastly, as every working man under capitalism is
estranged from
his spiritual aspect, man is estranged from man.</p>
<p>Marx's
study of the alienation of labour
under capitalism is an integral part of his economic theory. At that
point, it
enabled him to provide only a very general description of the condition
of the
working class in bourgeois society. Subsequently, as we shall see, Marx
expanded this theme, pointing out, besides new qualitative
characteristics,
quantitative relationships in which capitalist exploitation finds
expression.
(These relations are embodied in such categories of Marxist political
economy
as absolute and relative surplus-value, the organic structure of
capital, etc.)
However, these new qualitative and quantitative characteristics and
relationships did not contradict, but merely served to develop and
supplement
his earlier general description of capitalist exploitation and the
condition of
the working people under capitalism, which he gave in the <i>Economic
and
Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844</i>. Furthermore, these earlier
descriptions
proved far-reaching enough to explain many essential developments now
taking
place in industrially advanced capitalist countries. (It is this,
perhaps, that
explains the keen interest shown in the <i>Economic and
Philosophic Manuscripts
of 1844</i> at present throughout the world. There is a vast
literature to date
on this early work of Marx.)</p>
<p>The
rather high living standards attained
by some capitalist countries are accompanied by greatly intensified
capitalist
exploitation and simultaneously by the growing estrangement of the
masses from
every aspect of the life of society. Gus Hall, General Secretary of the
Communist Party of the United States, described the situation in these
words:
"In the minds of millions, in the capitalist world, there is growing a
new
criterion by which they measure and compare the two world systems.</p>
<p>"The
comparisons are not now limited
to industrial charts or prices of goods.</p>
<p>"What
is placed on the scales now is
the overall quality of life. Standards of physical comforts remain very
important in determining the quality of life, but the yardstick is much
broader
now. It includes the total spectrum of human values, the order of
priorities, dictated
by the inherent laws of each system. It includes the moral, cultural
and
philosophical concepts nurtured by each system. Many of the new
components that
add up to a quality of life cannot be measured by charts." Gus Hall
mentioned as a major qualitative characteristic of the position of
working
people in the capitalist countries "the growing sense of insecurity,
alienation and frustration of not being involved." <a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[18]</a></p>
<p>It is
important to note that, as Marx
showed, capitalist private property, the capitalist's power over
production and
the products of worker's labour is a direct consequence of alienation
of labour.
In turn, private property, which is a material embodiment of alienated
labour,
leads to further alienation of labour, which means that this
relationship is
reciprocal.</p>
<p>Thus
the concept of alienated labour, as
developed by Marx in <i>Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of
1844</i>, still
only represented a very general description of the process of
capitalist
exploitation. Its inner workings were not disclosed by Marx at that
time. The
task was now to show how, after all, the relationship between worker
and capitalist
is based on commodity-money (i.e., exactly equivalent) relations
dominating all
aspects of bourgeois society. In other words, the task was to explain
capitalist profit in terms of the law of value, the law of equivalent
exchange.
To solve this task, Marx carried to a greater depth his investigation
of the
process of material production, as a result of which he made his two
great
discoveries. The first was his creation of a materialist conception of
history
(or historical materialism), the elucidation of the law of the
development of
human society. The second was his exposure of the secret of capitalist
production, the development of the theory of surplus-value, elucidating
the
economic law to which the movement of bourgeois society is subject.
These two
discoveries, which transformed Utopian socialism into scientific
socialism, are
the next topic of our discussion.</p>
<h2>2. The First Great Discovery
(1845-46)</h2>
<p>From
their joint investigation of material
production, carried out in the middle of the 1840s at Brussels where
they both
lived at that lime, Marx and Engels could conclude that material
production was
a dialectical (i.e., indissoluble and at the same time contradictory)
unity of
its two
aspects&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the productive forces and the relations of
production.</p>
<p>The
productive forces of society, i.e., the
means of labour society has at its disposal, make up the material core
of
production, showing how man is equipped for dealing with the forces of
nature.</p>
<p>Production
is, however, a social process,
in the course of which people engaged in it establish definite
production
relations with each other. These relations, which form the social
fabric of
material production, are its other fundamental aspect.</p>
<p>What
is, then, the dialectics of the
productive forces and production relations? They are interdependent in
that the
development of production relations must correspond to the development
of the
productive forces. This dependence is relative, for while the
productive forces
on the whole are definitive in material production, and so, ultimately,
to
social development at large, the relations of production, in their
turn, have a
feedback effect on the development of the productive forces,
stimulating or
hampering them. The contradiction between the productive forces and
relations
of production is the fundamental contradiction in any society. The
productive
forces are more dynamic. They develop faster than production relations
which
are, to a certain extent, conservative. Therefore, when production
relations
begin to hold back the progress of the productive forces and become a
fetter
upon them, they are replaced by new production relations consistent
with the
more advanced productive forces. These relations of production exist
until they
also become a brake on the productive forces. Then they are again
replaced by
other, more progressive relations of production.</p>
<p>In
class society, a definite pattern of
material production is matched by a definite class pattern, and for
this reason
the contradiction between the productive forces and production
relations
emerges as a contradiction between different classes of society, taking
the
form of class struggle. Thus, according to Marx and Engels, the
contradiction
between the growing productive forces and their outmoded social form
(production
relations) is ultimately responsible for all historical collisions,
being the
cause of social revolutions which, for the duration of a definite
historical
period, bring into agreement the material core of production and its
social
fabric.</p>
<p>The
materialist conception of history (or
historical materialism), advanced by Marx and Engels, was a great
discovery, a
great scientific hypothesis, which at once made it possible to pose and
answer
scientifically the question of the law of the development of human
society and
of the probable tendencies of its development. For the first time in
the
history of science a conception of the development of human society was
evolved, which showed how society functioned at every given moment of
its
existence, and how it developed in the course of history. At the basis
of
society is material production viewed as a unity of its two aspects in
their
development. It was possible at once to explain all previous history as
the
history of class struggle and to reveal the essence of that struggle.</p>
<p>But,
of course, Marx and Engels were
interested first and foremost in the history and chief tendencies of
the
development of the bourgeois society of their own time. Therefore, in
their joint
work <i>The German Ideology</i>, in which they expounded
their materialist
conception of history,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[*]</span></span></a>
Marx and Engels brought this conception to bear specifically on
capitalist
society, formulating for the first time the main principles of the
theory of
scientific socialism. These principles amount to the following.</p>
<p>Capitalist
society is characterised by an
antagonistic, irreconcilable contradiction between the productive
forces and
production relations. When commodities were manufactured by individual
independent producers from their own raw materials and with their own
implements of individual production, the products of labour were
legitimately
appropriated by the producer. Under capitalism, the owner of the means
of
production appropriates the products of social labour, of the labour of
<i>others</i>.
Millions of working people go daily to their jobs at factories,
building sites,
laboratories, offices, agricultural enterprises. They have no means of
production in their possession. On being fired from their jobs, they
retain no
connection with the enterprise that employed them. These people are
wage-workers. Capitalists, on the other hand, own the means of
production, they
control vast factories, mineral resources, labour. They derive profit
from the
capital produced by other people's labour. Thus the development of
large-scale
industry under private property merely keeps widening the rift between
capital
and labour, for private property, Marx pointed out in <i>Economic
and
Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844</i>, is nothing but power to
dispose of others'
labour, the exploitation of labour by capital. Development of the
productive
forces under capitalism deprives small commodity producers of the
ownership of
the instruments and means of production, turning the majority of the
members of
society into proletarians; the productive forces themselves often
become
destructive. Marx showed that the antagonistic contradiction between
the
productive forces and relations of production manifests itself, in
particular,
in the economic crises which periodically shake bourgeois economy, and
hastens
the collapse of the capitalist system. This contradiction, therefore,
provides
the basis for socialist revolution.</p>
<p>Bourgeois
society is further characterised
by the domination of men by social relations. Under conditions of the
social
division of labour on the basis of private property the productive
forces turn
into a social force which is not only independent of men's will and
activity,
but which itself dominates them. We have seen that the conversion of
the
products of men's activity into a material force which dominates them
represents the alienation of this activity. This alienation can only be
abolished in a communist society.</p>
<p>To
understand Marx's train of thought, it
is important to bear in mind the distinction between scientific
socialism and
various Utopian conceptions. This distinction was shown, in particular,
in the
fact that in scientific socialism the giant growth of the productive
forces is
regarded as the material prerequisite of a communist society. That was
why
Marx, unlike the Utopian socialists, regarded the development of
large-scale
capitalist production as a highly progressive factor. The abundance of
goods,
which is a necessary prerequisite of communism, can be achieved only if
the
development of the productive forces is at a high level. Marx and
Engels wrote:
".. in general, people cannot be liberated as long as they are unable
to
obtain food and drink, housing and clothing in adequate quality and
quantity." Without the highly developed productive forces, "... want
is merely made general, and with destitution the struggle for
necessities and
all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced ..." <a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[19]</a></p>
<p>From
the class struggle in bourgeois
society it follows that the proletariat must first of all win political
power,
i.e., carry out a revolution. In the course of this revolution the
formation of
a new, communist outlook takes place among the masses. The proletariat
turns
into a class really capable of building a new economic basis for
society to
replace private property. This new basis is social ownership which
corresponds
to the social character of the productive forces. Along with private
property,
the revolution abolishes also the alienation of the worker from the
objects
which he has produced but which do not belong to him and which he is
subjugated
by. Communism implies control and conscious domination over the forces
which up
to then had controlled men. The development of communist society is
"subordinated to a general plan of freely combined individuals." <a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[20]</a>
A
socialist revolution destroys the material basis of the social division
of
labour imposed on people by force, abolishing the compulsory division
of social
activity, the antithesis between town and country above all. Marx
showed that
the personal freedom of the individual is possible only where there is
social
ownership. Only by destroying the system of wage-labour can the
worker's
personality be preserved.</p>
<p>To
complete the description of the theory
of scientific communism expounded in <i>The German Ideology</i>,
it must be
said that it was not until Marx and Engels had found in the depth of
capitalist
society the force which alone could and indeed was to build the new
society--the proletariat, the working class&#8212;that socialism was put on a
scientific basis for the first time and began to develop from Utopian
socialism
into scientific socialism.</p>
<p>The
principles of scientific communism
formulated in <i>The German Ideology</i> were carried
forward in some works
written by Marx and Engels in the latter half of the 1840s - in <i>The
Poverty
of Philosophy</i>, <i>Wage-Labour and Capital</i>
and <i>Manifesto of the
Communist Party</i>. These principles remained unshakable in the
course of the
further development of Marxist doctrine, lying at the very core of it,
but they
were substantially developed, amplified and made more concrete, and -
what is
very important - they were scientifically justified and proved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The elaboration by Marx and
Engels of the materialist conception of history and its concrete
application to
bourgeois society, which made it possible to formulate the main
principles of
the theory of scientific communism, rested, as we saw, on the analysis
of the
dialectical unity of the productive forces and the relations of
production
within the framework of social production, which was provided in <i>The
German
Ideology</i>. At the basis of this unity (which will be dealt
with at more
length in the second part of this book) is the general methodological
principle
of Marxist theory, which requires that a distinction be made between
the
material content and social form of -every social phenomenon. This
approach to
social phenomena allows them to be considered from a historical angle,
in the
process of development, while simultaneously showing the source of this
development, which is the contradiction between the material content
and social
form of phenomena.</p>
<p>In
their works written in the 1840s Marx
and Engels carried out the <i>macroanalysis</i> of social
production. It was
established that the material content of production is comprised of the
productive forces while the relations of production make up its social
form.
The theory of scientific communism was the immediate conclusion from
this
macroanalysis of the structure of social production.</p>
<p>After
this Marx naturally was faced with
the task of providing further economic substantiation to the
materialist
conception of history and to the theory of scientific communism which
naturally
follows from this conception. This task could be solved only by means
of <i>microanalysis</i>
of capitalist production, in the process of a detailed examination of
the
system of capitalist relations of production considered in dialectical
unity
with the productive forces of capitalist society. As he subjected
capitalist
production to microanalysis, studying the fundamental processes going
on in it,
Marx laid bare the mechanism of its functioning, thus revealing the
economic
law of the movement of bourgeois society and the possible tendencies of
its
development, which was vital to the economic substantiation of the
theory of
scientific communism. Simultaneously, it was the second great discovery
made by
Marx, whereby socialism was finally transformed from a Utopia into a
science.
However, before dealing with this discovery, we must look at yet
another
important aspect of Marx's method of work.</p>
<h2>3. The Booklover</h2>
<p>In
his fascinating <i>Reminiscences of Marx
and Engels</i><a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[21]</a>
Paul Lafargue, the well-known revolutionary, describes Marx's study in
his home
in Maitland Park Road in London to which Marx and his family moved in
the
spring of 1864. It was a room on the first floor, with a broad window
looking
out onto the park, and the inevitable English fireplace. The walls were
lined
with bookcases filled with books and stacked up to the ceiling with
newspapers
and manuscripts. Books were also on two tables and on the mantelpiece.
Books
were everywhere, except on the leather sofa on which Marx used to lie
down for
a rest from time to time with a novel.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,
the thousand-odd volumes
which made up Marx's personal library comprised merely an infinitesimal
part of
the number of books Marx studied during his life. This is evident from
the
numerous notebooks in which Marx wrote down excerpts from the books lie
read,
often accompanying them by his own comments. The notebooks alone might
make a
sizable library.</p>
<p>By
temperament Marx was not an armchair
scholar but a revolutionary. Still, when filling in a "questionnaire"
at his daughters' request, Marx's reply to what lie considered to be
his
favourite occupation was "book-worming." <a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[22]</a>
Of
course this questionnaire was done in jest, but as in every jest there
was a
grain of truth. Marx's theory did not emerge merely from an analysis of
concrete capitalist reality. His study of countless books in a great
variety of
fields, above all in history, philosophy and political economy, enabled
Marx to
draw a faithful picture of the life of bourgeois society in motion and
explain
how it originated, functioned and developed.</p>
<p>Marx
said that "It is only by
substituting for conflicting dogmas the conflicting facts and real
antagonisms
which form their hidden background that political economy can be
transformed
into a positive science."<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[23]</a>
These <i>facts</i> Marx drew from books. Many concrete
facts, e.g. , on the
position of the working class, Marx found in Blue Books, the
blue-covered
statistical publications of the British Parliament. Just as the proofs
of the
first volume of <i>Capital</i> began to arrive, "...Blue
Books came flying
in between one after the other as I was whipping the chapter into <i>final
shape</i>," Marx wrote to Engels, and I was delighted to find my
theoretical results fully confirmed by the facts. "<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[24]</a></p>
<p>Most
valuable facts were communicated to
Marx by Engels, who had been working for many years at the office of
his
father, a Manchester textile mill owner. One of the manuscripts of <i>Capital</i>
contains a direct reference to Engels - "As examples, Engels has given
me
..." followed by an examination of expenditures on raw materials, wages
and machinery in a spinning-factory. <a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[25]</a></p>
<p>Elaborating
the theory of economic crises,
Marx made the significant conclusion that the renewal of machinery was
the
material ground for the explanation of the cyclic development of
industrial
production. If the conclusion was correct, it followed from it that
such a
renewal should take place not oftener than once every ten years, while
Charles
Babbage, a noted English economist, asserted that in Manchester the
greater
part of machinery was renewed on average every five years. At Marx's
request,
Engels made detailed calculations which clearly showed that "Babbage is
quite wrong," as the actual term of renewal was "certainly not under
ten years," but rather between ten and thirteen years and a half. "My
best thanks for your explanations on machinery," Marx wrote back.
"The figure of 13 years corresponds, as much as is needed, to the
theory,
too."<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[26]</a></p>
<p>Concrete
factual material played an
enormous part in the elaboration and substantiation of Marxist economic
theory.
Here are a few more illustrations.</p>
<p>When
in 1862 Marx developed, while working
on <i>Capital</i>, his theory of ground-rent, i.e., the
income received in
bourgeois society by landlords, he subjected to criticism the
ground-rent
theory proposed by David Ricardo, the famous English economist. Marx
found
Ricardo's theory had serious shortcomings as it was based on the
Malthusian
"law" of the deterioration of land fertility. As far back as 1851
Marx had set himself the task "to square the law of rent with the
progress
of fertility of agriculture in general." He had emphasised that it was
after all "the only way to explain the historical facts and on the
other
hand to scrap Malthus's theory of the deterioration... of the land." <a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[27]</a>
Marx
carried out this intention in 1862. The decisive factor that disproved
Ricardo's thesis on the steady increase of the price of grain was the
table of
average annual grain prices in England from 1641 to 1859.<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[28]</a>
The
table left nothing of Ricardo's assertions which were based on the
increase in
prices observed over the period 1797-1815. Marx showed that for a
period of
more than two hundred years prices alternately moved up and down and
that the
formation of ground-rent was possible not only when inferior land was
brought
under cultivation, but when either better or worse land was cultivated
and also
regardless of whether the prices of farm produce increased, were
unchanged or
decreased.</p>
<p>Marx
regarded the analysis of concrete
facts of decisive importance. Criticising the followers of the French
socialist
Proudhon, who held that all the maladies of bourgeois society sprang
from the
faulty system of money circulation, Marx showed concretely that the
Proudhonians' statistic evidence did not hold water, that "economic
facts
do not furnish them with the test of their theories; rather, they
furnish the
proof of their lack of mastery of the facts," <a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[29]</a></p>
<p>But
there were also facts of a different
kind, theoretical facts of perhaps even greater importance to Marx's
economic
theory. Marx obtained these facts, which had been established in part
by
pre-Marxian political economy, by means of a critical study of the
history of
economic thought. His investigation of the history of bourgeois
political
economy supplied Marx with two paradoxical facts which the classical
economic
school, headed by Adam Smith and David Ricardo, proved unable to
explain. The
first of these facts was that in bourgeois society, in which there
undoubtedly
prevail commodity-money relations regulated by the law of value (i.e. ,
the law
of equivalent exchange, by which the exchange of commodities is
effected in
accordance with the amount of socially necessary labour expended on
their
production), in this society, in its most important sphere, production,
there
takes place essentially non-equivalent, unequal exchange between labour
and
capital, i.e., the exploitation of workers by capitalists.</p>
<p>The
existence of capitalist exploitation
was established beyond doubt in the Adam Smith and Ricardo theory. Adam
Smith
wrote, for instance: "The <i>value which the workmen add to the
materials</i>,
therefore, resolves itself... into <i>two parts, of which the
one pays their
wages, the other the profits of their employer</i>..." <a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[30]</a>
Thus the
worker's unpaid surplus-labour is the source of surplus-value, of
profit. The
classical bourgeois economists went no farther than stating this fact.
However,
consistent observation of the propositions of the labour theory of
value (the
evolvement of this theory was the chief contribution of Smith and
Ricardo for
which their names have gone down in the history of political economy)
required
that it should be extended to include also surplus-value, that the law
of value
should be applied to explain capitalist exploitation, i.e.,
appropriation of
the worker's unpaid labour by the capitalist. Otherwise, one had to
reject, the
labour theory of value. That was just what bourgeois economists, the
followers
of Smith and Ricardo, did. Their attempts to solve the problem failed
and
ultimately compelled the classical school to abandon the labour theory
of value
altogether.</p>
<p>Marx
discovered the above-mentioned
paradoxical fact when he was studying bourgeois political economy in
the 1840s
and 50s, and explained it, as we shall see further on, in 1857-58 in
the
manuscripts of <i>Zur Kritik der politischen Oekonomie</i>,
which was the
original version of <i>Capital</i>. The explanation of
this fact, which made it
possible to define the main propositions of the theory of
surplus-value,
constituted the second great discovery made by Marx.</p>
<p>Another,
equally paradoxical, fact, also
discovered by Marx as he analysed works by bourgeois economists, was
that
competition among capitalists regulated their profits depending on the
share of
each capital in the total capital and not on the surplus-labour each
individual
capitalist squeezes out of the workers. It meant that in the capitalist
economy
prices were not regulated on the basis of the law of value but on the
basis of
the law of the price of production, i.e., not in proportion to the
labour
expended but in proportion to the capital expended. It was all the more
astonishing as in economic theory price is regarded as value expressed
in
money. Bourgeois political economists who had discovered this fact
vainly
sought to reconcile the two laws. For this purpose Ricardo simply
equated value
and the price of production, which at once brought him and his
supporters into
collision with facts and ultimately made them abandon the labour-theory
of
value. The task confronting the student in this case was to calculate
the price
of production from value, to explain on the basis of the law of value
the
fundamental shift in price formation which occurred with the transition
from
simple commodity to capitalist market economy. Marx solved this problem
in the
early 1860s, in his manuscript <i>A Contribution to the Critique
of Political
Economy</i>, the second rough draft of <i>Capital</i>.
By the same token, the
theory of surplus value was completed.</p>
<p>Lastly,
we must mention yet another group
of facts which were of significance to Marx's studies. These facts
emerged from
the understanding and portrayal of reality by geniuses of world
literature.
Along with the works of economists, philosophers and historians, Marx
readily
quoted Balzac, Dickens, Defoe, Shakespeare, Cervantes and other writers
in <i>Capital</i>
to illustrate his theoretical propositions. We find many pages in Marx
devoted
to facts drawn from novels: Gobseck's cupidity, utterances of Bill
Sykes, a
cut-throat portrayed by Dickens, Robinson Crusoe's adventures, and so
forth.
Marx thought very highly of Balzac, who, he said, was "...generally
remarkable fur his profound grasp of reality." In his reminiscences of
Marx, Paul Lafargue reports that Marx intended to write a review of La
Comedie
Humaine as soon as he had finished Capital. <a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[31]</a>
In a letter to Margaret Harkness, an English authoress, Engels
confessed that
from Balzac's novels "even in economic details... I have learned more
than
from all the professed historians, economists and statisticians of the
period
together."<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[32]</a>
It is enough to recall, for instance, the brilliant pages in Volume I
of
Capital, in which Marx, giving a general description of social
formations, uses
the character of Robinson Crusoe, <a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[33]</a>
to see that facts described in novels were used by Marx as sources to
the same
extent as empirical facts and facts of economic theory.</p>
<p>Sometimes
knowledge gained from books is
divorced from reality and conflicts with knowledge gained from
first-hand
experience of life. As we have seen, nobody could say that this was
true of
Marx. Together with Engels he founded an entirely new scientific
theory, a
revolutionary theory expressing the needs of the working class which
had
emerged on the historical scene. This theory did not spring out of thin
air but
was the direct development of all that was progressive and fundamental
that mankind
had achieved. Yet the intellectual wealth man possesses is contained
above all
in books. That was why Marx, who prized revolutionary action above
everything
else in the world, became a voracious reader. His knowledge of
capitalist
reality became wider and deeper as lie studied bourgeois economic
literature.
The Mont Blanc of facts on which <i>Capital</i> is built
was extracted by Marx
from hooks. For many years Marx spent whole days from morning till
night in the
reading room of the British Museum, the largest library in the world at
that
time, and then, until late, worked on his notes, synopses, excerpts,
and filled
thousands of pages of manuscripts comprising the various versions of
one book -
<i>Capital</i>.</p>
<h2>4. The Second Great Discovery
(1857-58)</h2>
<p>Over
a very short space of time, from
October 1857 to May 1858, after fifteen years of studying capitalist
economy,
Marx produced a manuscript of over 1,200 typed pages which he entitled <i>Grundrisse.
Foundations of the Critique of Political Economy</i> and which
represents, as
you know, the first rough sketch of <i>Capital</i>. The
complete text of this
manuscript was published for the first time in the Soviet Union in
1939, in
German. In 1953, this edition was reproduced in the German Democratic
Republic,
and subsequently it was translated into Russian, Japanese, English,
Italian,
French, Spanish, Czech and Hungarian. The fact that it has become so
widely
read and has been the subject of numerous reviews is due to the
prominent place
it occupies in the history of Marxism, being the first exposition of
Marx's
theory of value on the basis of which he evolved the theory of
surplus-value,
the keystone of Marxist economic theory.</p>
<p>Marx
made extensive use of <i>Grundrisse</i>
in his work on <i>Capital</i>. However, it contains much
that was not included
in the final text of <i>Capital</i>. This refers above all
to a number of vital
points having to do with the substantiation of scientific, communism
and being
of particular relevance to the present.</p>
<p>Working
on <i>Grundrisse</i>, Marx
discovered the economic law of the movement of bourgeois society and
showed on
the basis of economic analysis that its revolutionary transformation
into a
communist society was inevitable. It is not at all surprising that Marx
should
subject the problems of this transformation, the problems of the
emergence of
communist society, to a detailed examination in this manuscript. As he
developed his economic theory, Marx was forced to pay more attention to
special
economic questions (any study in depth of a problem invariably entails
narrowing the field of inquiry). But while he was writing the original
version
of <i>Capital</i> he still studied the problems of
economic theory over a very
broad field selecting for the sake of comparison material which went
outside
the framework of <i>Capital</i>, and had a bearing on both
pre-capitalist
formations and on the future communist society. From this it must be
clear why <i>Grundrisse</i>
should have now become the object of such keen interest everywhere, and
by no
means only among Marxists. So let us examine it more closely.</p>
<p>At
the basis of the theory of value put
forward by Marx in <i>Grundrisse</i> is the conception of
the commodity as the
elementary "economic cell-form" of capitalism. This conception, which
Marx arrived at when writing the manuscript, was later stated in the
opening
lines of the first volume of <i>Capital</i>: "The wealth
of those
societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents
itself
as 'an immense accumulation of commodities,' its unit being a single
commodity.
Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a
commodity." <a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[34]</a>
We shall
discuss the methodological significance of this discovery later on. At
this
point it is important to note that according to Marx a commodity is a
dialectical, indissoluble and simultaneously contradictory, unity of
use-value
and value. As <i>use-values</i>, all commodities differ
qualitatively. As <i>values</i>
they are qualitatively the same, all being products of labour, and
differ only
quantitatively, in labour-time embodied in them. Use-value constitutes
the
material content of a commodity, its ability to satisfy some human
want. Value,
on the other hand, is the social form of a commodity as a product of
labour. It
is felt whenever one commodity is exchanged for another. In the process
of
exchange, one commodity became singled out (for various historical
reasons it
was gold) which became money&#8212;an embodiment, an equivalent of value.
Before he
can obtain the commodities he wants, the producer of a certain
commodity has to
exchange it for money, with which he proceeds to buy commodities from
other
producers.</p>
<p>But
perhaps the most important point in the
development of the theory of value by Marx was that from the conception
of a
commodity as a dialectical unity of use-value and value Marx passed to
the
conception of <i>labour</i>, by which commodities are
produced, as dialectical
unity of concrete (private) labour, which results in the creation of
use-values, and abstract (social) labour, which forms the value of a
commodity.
The conception of the dual nature of labour makes up the main content
of the
Marxist theory of value by which it differs fundamentally from the
labour
theory of value advanced by the predecessors of Marx, the founders of
bourgeois
political economy. No economist before Marx had been able to see the
dual
nature of labour as a particular feature of commodity production,
although some
bourgeois economists were not far from grasping the dual nature of the
commodity. Marx subsequently stressed the importance of the conception
of the
dual nature of labour, for, he wrote, "<i>all </i>understanding
of the
facts depends upon this."<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[35]</a></p>
<p>It is
a peculiarity of bourgeois society,
which is based on private property, that labour involved in the
production of a
commodity directly is <i>private</i> labour. Only when he
comes to the market
to sell a commodity does a capitalist learn whether or not the time
expended on
the production of the commodity was the <i>socially necessary</i>
labour-time.
Should the actual number of hours spent be greater than the socially
necessary
labour-time - which determines the value of a commodity - the
capitalist will
be unable to sell it or he will have to sell at a loss, at a price
lower than
the individual value of the commodity. Should the number of hours be
equal to
the socially necessary time, the individual value of the commodity is
then
equal to its social value, and its price is roughly equal to its value.
Lastly,
should the number of hours spent to produce the commodity be less than
the
socially necessary time, the capitalist will be able to sell it at a
price
above its individual value and pocket the extra profit. Thus, it is
only when a
commodity is brought to the market and turned into money that the
social nature
of concrete labour expended on its production is felt. The internal
contradiction between the use-value and value of a commodity, between
private
and social labour involved in its production, is resolved in exchange,
in the
realisation of the commodity, whereby it turns into money.</p>
<p>Having
disclosed the dual nature of labour
and the products of labour in bourgeois society, Marx was able to
proceed at
once to the analysis of the relations of capitalism proper, i.e., the
relations
between labour and capital, to explain the mechanism of capitalist
exploitation, to create the theory of surplus-value. What made these
relations
difficult to understand was that they appeared not at all what they
were.
"But," to quote Marx, "all science would be superfluous if the
outward appearance and the essence of things directly coincided." <a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="">[36]</a>
Indeed,
we have already mentioned that the exchange involved in the sale and
purchase
of labour-power is <i>essentially</i> non-equivalent.
Otherwise, where would
the capitalist's profit come from? But this exchange proceeds in
circumstances
where commodity-value relations regulated by the law of value, the law
of
equivalent exchange, overwhelmingly prevail. Consequently, the exchange
involved in the sale and purchase of labour-power should be explained
also in
terms of equivalent exchange and not in contradiction with it.</p>
<p>Marx
showed that the relation between
labour and capital includes two essentially different processes. First
of all,
it is the exchange itself between the worker and the capitalist, a
business
transaction whereby the capitalist "obtains the productive force which
maintains and multiplies capital," <a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[37]</a>
i.e., he gets the chance to dispose of the worker's labour-power, of
his
capacity to create new, surplus-value. Secondly, it is the process of
labour
itself, which derives from the material content of capitalist
production and
which actually serves to maintain and increase capital. Therefore &#8211; and
that
was the first point for the understanding of the mechanism of
capitalist
exploitation - the object of the deal made between the worker and the
capitalist is not the worker's labour but his ability to work. A worker
cannot
sell labour, for labour is the process of the consumption of
labour-power and
that takes place in production, not in the market. As he owns no means
of
production, a worker can own neither labour process nor its products.
All he
does own is his ability to work, his labour-power. And this is what he
sells to
the capitalist. Hence, it is not labour but labour-power that is a
commodity.
Before Marx, nobody had noticed this fact.</p>
<p>Thus
it is not labour but the labour-power,
of the wage-worker that the capitalist pays for. Labour-power is sold
to the
capitalist at its value which depends on the value of the means of
subsistence
usually consumed by a worker and his family. The capitalist, on the
other hand,
can dispose of the use-value of the commodity - the labour power -
which
consists of the worker's ability to create new value in the process of
labour.
In other words, the wage-worker sells to the employer the right to
dispose of
his labour-power.</p>
<p>For
example, during a week a wage-worker
produces a certain amount of goods whose value is much greater than a
week's
value of labour-power. Under fixed hours, say, nine a day, only some of
the
time is spent on producing value equal to the value of labour-power.
This is <i>necessary
labour</i> which goes to produce tile equivalent of the worker's
wages. The
rest of the time the worker performs <i>surplus-labour</i>
producing
surplus-value which is kept by the capitalists, i.e., owners of the
means of
production. Marx defines surplus-value as the difference between the
new value
which the worker creates by his labour and the value of labour-power,
which the
capitalist pays the worker in wages.</p>
<p>It
was very important to establish that the
capitalist system creates all the conditions necessary and sufficient
for the
existence of surplus-value. The capitalist relations of production,
founded on
the capitalist private ownership of the means of production necessarily
result
in the fact that the worker's labour, and therefore the products of his
labour,
belong to the capitalist. The law of value, the law of equivalent
exchange, as
we saw just now, allows new value produced in the process of labour to
be
greater than the value of labour-power. Having bought labour-power, the
capitalist gets the right of ownership of the product of surplus-labour
as well
as of the product of necessary labour. Lastly, in capitalist society
the level
of the productive forces' development, the productivity of social
labour are
such that necessary labour takes up merely a part of the working day.
In other
words, newly created value really does exceed the value of
labour-power, i.e.,
surplus-value really does exist.</p>
<p>Thus
Marx showed - and that was his second great
discovery - that the appropriation by the capitalists of surplus-value
produced
by workers proceeds in full conformity with the inherent laws of
capitalist
economy, with the law of value, above all. Consequently, capitalist
exploitation derives from the very substance of the capitalist
relations of
production. Under capitalism, exploitation is inherent in the process
of
production itself, the production of commodities being simultaneously
the
production of surplus-value. It immediately followed from this that the
emancipation of the working class from capitalist exploitation cannot
be
achieved within the capitalist social system. In other words, the <i>necessity</i>
of a socialist revolution became the obvious conclusion.</p>
<p>Marx
showed further that the tremendous
development of the productive forces under capitalism simultaneously
made for
the creation and accumulation of the material elements of a future
communist
society. These material elements - they will be dealt with in the third
part of
this book - determine the <i>possibility</i> of a
socialist revolution.
"But within bourgeois society, the society which rests on <i>exchange-value</i>,"
writes Marx, "there arise such relations of production as well as
social
relations which are so many mines to explode it ... if we did not find
concealed in society as it is the material conditions of production and
the
corresponding relations of exchange prerequisite for a classless
society then
all attempts to explode it would be quixotic." <a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[38]</a>
It is in
the creation of such prerequisites for the transition to a communist
society
that the historical justification of capitalism and its progressive
role lie.
Capitalism alone could raise the productive forces to a level which
makes
possible the transition to communism and the harmonious development of
all
members of society.</p>
<p>In
the <i>Manifesto of the Communist Party</i>
( 1848) Marx and Engels gave a brilliant description of communism as an
association in which "the free development of each is the condition for
the free development of all." <a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title="">[39]</a>
Now in this later work Marx discovered the material basis for such
development.
It was the surplus-product, the excess of the results of production
over
cost-price.</p>
<p>In
bourgeois society the surplus-product
becomes surplus-value and is appropriated by the capitalist class, and
under
communism it ensures "the full material conditions for the total,
universal development of the productive forces of the individual,"
"creates the material elements for the development of the rich
individuality which is as all-sided in its production as in its
consumption." <a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title="">[40]</a></p>
<p>For
how long can the progressive
development of capitalism continue? This is how Marx answers this
question:
"No social order ever perishes before all the productive forces for
which
there is room in it have developed; and new, higher relations of
production
never appear before the material conditions of their existence have
matured in
the womb of the old society itself." As soon as the prevailing system
of
relations of production, i.e., the economic basis of society, has
ceased to be
the optimal social form of development of the productive forces,
"further
development appears as decay, and the new development begins from a new
basis." <a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="">[41]</a>
This conclusion is very important also for the investigation of the
prospects
of the development of the productive forces of modern capitalist
society, which
we shall discuss later.</p>
<p>The
second great discovery of Marx, i.e.,
his theory of surplus-value we have just considered, brings home the <i>organic,
intrinsic connection</i> between Marxist economic theory and the
revolutionary
propositions of Marxism. One is indissolubly linked with the other, for
there
is no accepting Marx's economic theory without accepting its
revolutionary
conclusions. That was why Lenin referred to Marxist political economy
as "socialist
political economy." <a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title="">[42]</a></p>
<p>The
strictly <i>scientific character</i> of
the revolutionary conclusions of Marxist theory and of its predictions
as
regards the future, communist society also sterns from the Organic
connection
of economics and politics. We have seen that Marx arrived at the
conclusion about
the economic necessity of the socialist revolution only after he had
explained
the mechanism of capitalist exploitation in terms of the law of value.
Marx
gives special prominence to the correspondence of the main principles
of his
economic theory and its revolutionary conclusions with the law of value
which
reflects the dominance of commodity-value relations in capitalist
society.
Consistency with the theory of value is to Marx a criterion of the
truth of
each theoretical conclusion. There was, however, yet another and
equally
important yardstick which Marx invariably applied in developing his
theory. And
this we shall presently discuss.</p>
<h2>5. "I Administer Historical
Justice..."</h2>
<p>Our
description of Marx's method of work
would be very incomplete if we omitted to mention the <i>historical
aspect</i>
of his economic theory which invariably played an enormous part at
every stage
of its development. One of the most important features of Marx's method
was
that in his works analysis of the history of economic science and
development
of his own theory always ran parallel, combining into a single process
of
scientific inquiry. Historical and critical analysis is ever present in
Marx's
economic investigation both as the <i>point of departure</i>
and the <i>result</i>
of this study. Let us now take a closer look at it.</p>
<p>The
history of bourgeois political economy
inevitably furnished the starting point for Marxist economic theory,
for Marx
studied the economic relations prevailing in bourgeois society in his
day from
a historical aspect. The task he pursued was to disclose the economic
law which
the movement of capitalism obeyed. Marx found in the history of
bourgeois
political economy the reflection of the economic history of bourgeois
society.
If economic theory reflects reality more or less adequately, its
history
reflects the development of this reality. Consequently, by studying the
history
of economic theory one should be able to reproduce the process of
economic
development itself. Engels wrote: "The historical development of the
literature
of political economy provided a natural guiding thread with which
criticism
could link up, and the economic categories as a whole would thereby
appear in
the same sequence as in the logical development ... since indeed it is
the <i>actual</i>
development that is followed." <a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title="">[43]</a>
Therefore, the history of bourgeois political economy appears as an
essential
source of knowledge of the history of the capitalist economic system.</p>
<p>The
study of the creation of <i>Capital</i>
shows that the working out of each section of economic theory was
always
preceded by either more or less extensive inquiry into the history of
bourgeois
political economy. As Marx penetrated farther into the mechanism of
capitalist
exploitation, he extended the range of authors whose works he analysed,
and his
analysis became more detailed and thorough. Here are a few examples.
Marx's
first attempt to develop an economic theory of his own (in <i>Economic
and
Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844</i>) was accompanied by intensive
study of
bourgeois political economy in Paris. The appearance of <i>The
Poverty of
Philosophy</i> and <i>Wage-Labour and Capital</i>
(the latter half of the
1840s) was preceded by a much wider study of the works of bourgeois
economists
at Brussels and Manchester.</p>
<p>The
manuscript <i>Critique of Political
Economy</i> (1857-58) in which Marx expounded his theory of value
and
surplus-value was written on the basis of an enormous number of
notebooks in which
Marx had compiled excerpts from works by bourgeois economists in the
1850s.
Marx further elaborated the theory of surplus-value and evolved the
theories of
average profit, ground-rent, reproduction and crises, and productive
labour as
he worked on the <i>Theories of Surplus-Value</i>, the
historical part of <i>Capital</i>.</p>
<p>Marx
often called his economic
investigations "criticisms" (the subtitle of <i>Capital</i>
is <i>A
Critique of Political Economy</i>). Criticism, as Marx understood
it, meant
criticism of bourgeois society, establishing the reasons for the
necessity of
its destruction and mankind's transition to a communist society. It was
truly
constructive, useful criticism.</p>
<p>As he
studied the history of bourgeois
political economy, Marx discovered the key problems of economic theory
whose
solution enabled him to evolve an entirely new economic doctrine. Thus
the
works of bourgeois economists, especially those of the classical
Smith-Ricardo
school, taken together posed questions of the nature and mechanism of
capitalist exploitation, of exchange between labour and capital as the
fundamental relation of production in bourgeois society, of the dual
nature of
labour and its products, of the worker's surplus-labour as the source
of
capitalist profit, of the economic antagonism of the classes of
bourgeois
society, and so on. Bourgeois thought <i>posed</i> these
problems, thereby
furnishing Marx with points of departure for his own investigation. At
the same
time, the bourgeois economists' failure to solve these problems - their
failure
to "split" labour and its product and investigate their dual nature,
to see the elementary "cell-form" of capitalist economy, to view
"labour-power" as a commodity and as the intermediate link in the
exchange between labour and capital, to see capital as a relation of
production, to see how value turns into the price of production all
made it
clear to Marx that no economic substantiation of scientific communism
could be
given on the basis of bourgeois political economy. Attempts of this
kind undertaken
by Ricardian socialists led them to arrive at utterly Utopian
conclusions. Marx
said in an interview in 1871: "It is hardly likely, for instance, that
we
could hope to prosper in our war against capital if we derive our
tactics, say,
from the political economy of Mill. He has traced one kind of
relationship
between labour and capital. We hope to show that it is possible to
establish
another." <a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title="">[44]</a>
The solution by Marx of aforementioned key problems formed the basis of
the
political economy of the working class.</p>
<p>A
comprehensive investigation of the
evolution of bourgeois political economy was carried out by Marx when
he worked
on the long manuscript in 1861-63 (the second draft of <i>Capital</i>),
or more
precisely on its central part which he called <i>Theories of
Surplus-Value</i>.
He intended to trace the bourgeois economists' views on this
fundamental
problem of economics. This work presented an all-embracing critical
analysis of
bourgeois political economy which made Marx and Engels regard the <i>Theories
of Surplus-Value</i> as a sketch for the fourth and concluding
volume of <i>Capital</i>,
the final element in the structure of Marxist economic theory,
containing its <i>historical
justification</i>. And so it is commonly accounted to be.</p>
<p>The
thing of particular interest to us today
is that in connection with his analysis of the history of bourgeois
political
economy Marx considered a vast range of questions associated with the
antagonistic contradictions of capitalism, with the position and
struggle of
the working class in bourgeois society. It was the further development
of the
theory of surplus-value the foundations of which were laid, as we have
seen, in
1857-58. Some of these questions will he discussed in more detail in
the third
part of this book. So far we shall simply enumerate them.</p>
<p>As he
carried on his critical investigation
of the history of bourgeois political economy, Marx laid bare the roots
of the
subsistence theory of wages, a bourgeois theory which regards the value
of
labour-power as something permanent, independent of stages of
historical
development. His criticism of this conception permitted Marx later on
to work
out the main principles of the economic struggle of the working class
in
capitalist society for higher wages and shorter hours, and to prove the
objective
necessity and possibility of this struggle.</p>
<p>Marx's
investigation of the problem of
product ive labour made .it possible to ascertain the place of the
working
class in the structure of bourgeois society. His analysis of the
process of
capitalist production enabled Marx to conclude that economic crises
were an
inevitable attribute of capitalism. Of especial interest in the light
of the
current energy crisis in the capitalist countries is the fact that
along with
the crises of overproduction Marx considered also the crises of
underproduction
caused, for instance, by a shortage of raw materials. In connection
with his
analysis of accumulation of capital Marx investigated the influence of
the
latter on the position of the working class, discovering the objective
tendency
of its pauperisation and simultaneously pointing out the factors
opposing this
tendency, one of which is the workers' strike movement.</p>
<p>Elaboration
of the theory of average profit
and the price of production showed among other things that the
capitalist class
as a whole participates in the exploitation of the working class,
forming a
genuine "Masonic fraternity" in their opposition to the working
class. The working class can answer this only one way - by uniting its
ranks.
Thus the slogan "Working, men of all lands, unite!" received its
economic basis.</p>
<p>Consideration
of Marx's method of work
permits us to single out some of its characteristic features.</p>
<p>Marx
proceeded from the fact that the <i>paradoxical
and conflicting forms in which reality manifests itself</i>
merely reflected
its own paradoxical and conflicting nature. "Scientific truth," Marx
said, "is always paradox, if judged by everyday experience, which
catches
only the delusive appearance of things." <a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title="">[45]</a>
Earlier on we mentioned that Marx was the first in the history of
political
economy to explain the contradictory mechanism of capitalist
exploitation on
the basis of the law of value. Marx was able to do it by discarding
bourgeois
economic dogma which asserted (judging by everyday experience, which
catches
only the delusive appearance of things) that it was his labour that the
worker
sold to the capitalist. Marx demonstrated that the contradictory
character of
the sale and purchase of labour-power (the contradiction, as we saw, is
that
the essentially non-equivalent exchange between the capitalist and the
worker
is nevertheless regulated by the law of value) reflects the
antagonistic nature
of bourgeois society.</p>
<p>The
fundamental distinction of Marx's
method from that applied by the bourgeois economists was manifest also
in his
solution of the second central problem of capitalist economy, in the
explanation of the average rate of profit and the price of production
in terms
of the law of value. Striving to prove by all means the universal
character of
the law of value, Ricardo simply <i>identified</i> value
and the price of
production, discarding the problem as such. Marx approached it in a
diametrically opposite way. He showed that the contradiction between
value and
the price of production was merely an illusion. He proved it by
explaining the
price of production in terms of value, instead of identifying these two
different categories. On the contrary, in Marx's theory the price of
production
(equal to the cost-price plus the average profit) as a converted form
of value
(equal to the cost-price plus surplus-value) coincides with value only
in
exceptional cases. Only the total amount of surplus-value appropriated
by the
whole capitalist class is equal to the total amount of capitalist
profit. In
the same way, the sum of the prices of production is equal to the sum
of
values. On the other hand, the amount of profit obtained by an
individual
capitalist depends on the amount of the capital he has advanced. The
greater it
is, the greater the profit. The mechanism of capitalist competition
rigidly
regulates the distribution of the total profit among individual
capitalists.
Thus in this case too the contradictions in which the bourgeois
economists had
got hopelessly entangled were shown by Marx to be outward reflections
of the
objective contradictions of the capitalist system. On the surface of
bourgeois
society, surplus-value appears not as the product of surplus-labour but
as the
product of capital, i.e., it appears in the converted forms of profit
and
average profit. Accordingly, value appears in the converted form of the
price
of production. Outwardly it seems to be in contradiction to the theory
of value
but, as Marx showed, it is merely "an <i>illusion</i>
which arises from
the development of the thing itself...." <a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title="">[46]</a></p>
<p>To
get to the bottom of capitalist reality,
Marx thoroughly <i>revised</i> the most general,
fundamental notions of
political economy, such as labour, value, commodity, etc. We saw that
this
analysis had enabled Marx to discover the commodity as the elementary
economic
cell-form of capitalism containing in embryo all contradictions of
bourgeois
economy. In the same way the discovery of the dual nature of labour and
its
product, consistent application of the theory of value and its
extension to the
commodity peculiar to capitalism, i.e., to labour-power, gave Marx a
point of
departure for the development of the theory of surplus-value.</p>
<p>In
the course of his revision of the basic
principles of bourgeois economics Marx elucidated the <i>original
sources</i>
of various theories, ridding political economy of dogmatic accretions
which
conflicted with the intrinsic logic of science.</p>
<p>The
story of the writing of <i>Capital</i>
convincingly attests to the total <i>scientific scrupulousness</i>
of Marx, who
always put the interests of science first, and saw his duty as a
scholar and
proletarian revolutionary in getting at the truth. Condemning Malthus's
subservience to the more reactionary classes of bourgeois society, Marx
wrote:
"But when a man seeks to <i>accommodate</i> science to a
viewpoint which
is derived not from science itself (however erroneous it may be) but
from <i>outside,
from alien, external interests</i>, then I call him 'base'." <a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title="">[47]</a>
His
passionate abhorrence of the capitalist system did not prevent Marx, in
contradistinction
to the Utopian views of pre-Marxian socialists, from drawing the
conclusion
that, compared with the pre-capitalist formations, capitalism was
progressive.
It was this scientific conclusion that enabled him to discover the
economic law
of the movement of capitalism and detect in it the material and
spiritual
elements of the future society, which it is the historic mission of
bourgeois
society to create.</p>
<p>As a
conscientious scientist, Marx never
strove after popularity for popularity's sake. When his work <i>Contribution
to
the Critique of Political Economy</i> (1859), which at that date
only included
the chapter on commodities and the chapter on money, came out, many,
including
some of his friends and associates, found his manner of presentation
abstruse.
Replying to these objections, Marx stressed that "scientific attempts
to
revolutionise a science can never be really popular." <a href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title="">[48]</a>
As it
was, Marx's work was relevant in the highest degree as it laid the
groundwork
for the analysis of capitalist economy, already elucidating "the <i>specifically</i>
social, not the least <i>absolute</i>, character of
bourgeois production in its
simplest form, that of the commodity." <a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title="">[49]</a>
In other words, in this work the historically transient character of
capitalism
was explained. The lack of understanding which Marx's brilliant work
met at the
beginning evidently reflects&#8212;apart from the mental exertion it
required&#8212;the
habitually suspicious attitude towards abstract theory as scholastic
humbug of
no practical significance.</p>
<p>In a
letter to Engels of May 16, 1868, Marx
observed that in political economy points of practical interest and of
theoretical necessity were widely divergent. Scrupulous analysis of the
"economic cell-form" of capitalism might seem to some to be a mere
splitting of hairs, a fuss about trifles. Yet these "trifles" were of
fundamental importance to the theory of surplus-value. And if, to quote
G.
Gunnarson, a well-known theoretician and Scandinavian Social Democrat,
today
everybody recognises Marx's superiority as regards the explanation of
the basic
features of the development of capitalism&#8212;the task which bourgeois
economics
has understandably failed to solve,<a href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title="">[50]</a>
Marx owes much of it to his dauntless courage, to his ability to go
against the
current, to his belief that "at the entrance to science, as at the
entrance to hell, the demand must be posted:</p>
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Here
all mistrust
must be abandoned</p>
<p class="MsoQuote" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">And
here must Perish
every craven thought." <a href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title=""><b><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: black;" lang="EN-GB">[51]</span></b></a></p>
