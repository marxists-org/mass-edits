Capital, Vygodsky,

<h3>PART II "... NOT A DOCTRINE BUT A METHOD"</h3>
<p>As we looked at certain stages
in the
history of <i>Capital</i>, we saw the tremendous role
played at every
stage by
Marx's <i>method of economic research</i>. It would be no
exaggeration
to say
that scientific method was <i>decisive</i> to the
development of
Marx's
economic theory. "The working out of the method which forms the
foundation
of Marx's criticism of political economy," Engels observed, "we
consider a result of hardly less importance than the basic materialist
outlook itself."
<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[52]</a>
It was
the superiority of Marx's method of research over the method of
bourgeois
political economy that enabled him to solve the fundamental problems of
economics and produce an economic theory which is still relevant to
this day.</p>
<p>As he built up his theory, Marx
would
always clear away the "scaffolding" of method.- At the close of 1861,
he wrote to Engels: "My writing is getting on, but slowly. ... Anyway,
it
will be much more popular and the method much better hidden away." <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[53]</a>
Still,
by making a close study of the history of the development of Marx's
economic
doctrine, and in the first place of the economic drafts which comprise
the
different versions of <i>Capital</i>, one can reconstruct
one after
another the
stages of its progress and see, to quote Hegel, "... the result along
with
the process of arriving at it." <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[54]</a></p>
<p>The basic feature of Marx's
economic
manuscripts is that they reflect, above all, the process of theoretical
investigation of the capitalist economy while the three volumes of <i>Capital</i>
mainly contain an <i>exposition</i> of the already
developed theory.
For this
reason the method of economic inquiry which Marx developed and applied
in the
process of his investigation, later, when the theory was expounded, was
"hidden away." This is what makes it so important to study Marx's
legacy as a whole, for it is only in this way that one may form a
comprehensive
idea of Marxist economic doctrine.</p>
<p>In this part of the book we
would like to
describe certain features of Marx's scientific method (already
disclosed in
part in the discussion of how <i>Capital</i> was written)
and
illustrate them
by concrete examples.</p>
<h2>1. Understanding Reality</h2>
<p>At the end of August 1857 Marx
wrote an
outline for the Introduction to <i>Capital</i>. In it he
stated in
more detail
than anywhere else his ideas respecting the method of studying
political
economy he had worked out. Marx described it as <i>advancing</i>
from
the
simplest, the most general and abstract to more concrete concepts of
reality.
The readers may be aware that that is the general method by which every
science
develops, and the main principles of which were formulated by Hegel
long ago.
Nevertheless, Marx was the first to apply this method from materialist
positions, the first to give it a <i>materialist interpretation</i>.
Marx
showed, firstly, that advancing from the abstract to the concrete is
necessarily preceded by proceeding from the concrete to the abstract.
Thus
reality serves as the starting-point of scientific theory. Secondly,
Marx
showed that advancing from the abstract to the concrete essentially
corresponds
to the actual process of history and terminates in a scientific,
integral
reproduction of the concrete.</p>
<p>Let us illustrate this
important feature of
Marx's scientific method by discussing how he evolved his theory of
value. Marx
expounded this theory for the first time in the part of the manuscript
of
1857-58, entitled <i>The Chapter on Money</i> and opening
with the
criticism of
the petty-bourgeois theory of money advanced by Proudhon and
Proudhonians. This
fact has its own profound methodological reasons. After all money is a
form in
which the value of a commodity is expressed. Money is the external
expression
of value. In his criticism of petty-bourgeois and then also of
bourgeois
political economy (the petty-bourgeois Proudhonian theory of money was
actually
nothing but a bourgeois interpretation carried to an absurdity) Marx
always
began by going from the surface to the essence gradually delving deeper
and
deeper into capitalist reality. For this reason Marx began his
manuscript with
a study of the theory of money and only after that proceeded to examine
the
value of a commodity. Later on Marx wrote: "In fact we started from
exchange-value, or the exchange relation of commodities, in order to
get at the
value that lies hidden behind it." <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[55]</a>
In the course of research Marx showed that the theory of money was the
consequence of the theory of value and therefore the false bourgeois
and
petty-bourgeois theories of value were consequences of false theories
of value
as also of the essential shortcomings of the labour theory of value of
the
classical bourgeois economists.</p>
<p>How a bourgeois economist
understood the
category of money was therefore to Marx the test of his understanding
of the
category of value. And the same can be said of Marx's own theory: his
theory of
value stands or falls on the soundness of his theory of money. In his
works of
the latter half of the 1840s Marx largely shared the Ricardian theory
of value
with all its shortcomings.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[*]</a>
Marx also shared the Ricardian so-called quantitative theory of money.
According to this theory which was shared&#8212;and is still shared&#8212;by the
majority
of bourgeois economists, money is not a specific commodity performing
the part
of the universal equivalent, but merely an instrument of circulation.
Marx
wrote in <i>The Poverty of Philosophy</i>: "...precisely
gold and
silver,
as money, are of all commodities the only ones <i>not</i>
determined
by their
cost of production; and this is so true that in circulation they can be
replaced by paper." <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[56]</a>
The falsity of the typically quantitative approach to the theory of
money
becomes strikingly obvious at the time of monetary crises, when paper
money is
drastically depreciated and its absolute dependence on gold, this
specific
commodity, comes to light.</p>
<p>Having worked out his theory of
value, Marx
immediately took a critical look at the quantitative theory of money.
"Ricardo's theory of money," he stated in the manuscript of 185758,
"is as completely refuted as its false assumptions." <a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[57]</a>
It is
important to note that already in <i>The Poverty of Philosophy</i>
Marx posed
the question of the objective necessity of money under a system of
production
which rests on the individual exchange of the products of labour.
Simultaneously he stressed that the question that had concerned
Proudhon, as to
why gold and silver performed this particular function was a secondary
question
the answer to which should be sought not in the bourgeois economic
system as a
whole but in the specific qualities of gold and silver as substances <a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[58]</a>
Raising
the question of the necessity of money under commodity production, Marx
in <i>The
Poverty of Philosophy</i> did not yet offer any solution. That
could be
furnished only in conjunction with the theory of value, as one of its
consequences. Thus the working out of the Marxist theory of value in
the manuscripts
of 1857-58 simultaneously attests that Marx produced his own theory of
value
only at that time.</p>
<p>In the first volume of <i>Capital</i>
the
category of a commodity as the "economic cell-form" of bourgeois
society appears as the starting-point from which Marx built his theory
advancing from the abstract to the concrete. Behind it, however, lies
the
process of inquiry which brought Marx to this conception of a
commodity. And
this process is of great importance, as it alone makes it possible to
avoid
forming a false conception of a theory as an a priori construction. In
other
words, it makes it possible to avoid a dogmatic approach to Marx's
economic
theory. The study of the draft versions of <i>Capital</i>
affords us
the unique
opportunity of being present, as it were, at the birth of a new theory,
tracing
every detail of the difficult process of the discovery of the "economic
cell-form" of capitalism.</p>
<p>Examination of Marx's
scientific method&#8212;the
method of advancing from the abstract to the concrete--inevitably gives
rise to
certain questions in the reader's mind. First, Marx's analysis has
shown that
every social structure must have an elementary "economic cell-form"
peculiar to it, which furnishes the starting-point for building an
economic
theory for the society it is part of. The construction of such a theory
must
necessarily be preceded by the isolation of certain "determinant,
abstract,
general relations..." <a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[59]</a>
which together constitute the "cell-form" to be found. This gives
rise to the question as to what requirements the "economic cell-form"
must satisfy. Or, to put it differently, what limits the transition
from the
concrete to the abstract may (and must) reach before there begins the
reverse
process of advancing from the abstract to the concrete, i.e. the proper
process
of developing an economic theory. Second, the method of advancing from
the
abstract to the concrete dictates the necessity of making an economic
theory
concrete, advancing from the abstract, underlying categories to the
concrete.
"surface" categories.</p>
<p>What can be said in this
respect of Marx's
economic theory? Is it concrete or is it abstract? Does it need to be
made more
concrete? To these and some other questions we shall now proceed.</p>
<h2>2. "The Splitting of a Single Whole..."</h2>
<p>First of all it must be
recalled that in <i>The
German Ideology</i> (1845-46) Marx and Engels, analysing the
category
of social
production, for the first time consistently applied the fundamentally
important
method of studying social phenomena based on the determination of
material
content and social form of every social phenomenon. The category of
social
production was for the first time presented as a dialectical,
conflicting unity
of the productive forces and the relations of production.</p>
<p>The conflict between the
productive forces
and the relations of production appears as the source of the
development of
social production and ultimately as the source of historical
development at
large. Social material production conceived in this particular way was
defined
by Marx in 1857 as the object of his research. The productive forces
are
subject to economic analysis as the material content of social
production. the
material embodiment of the relations of production. The latter--like
all other
social relations&#8212;cannot be perceived by the senses, "by touch"; we
can only have a mental conception of them. We can fix them in thought,
separately from the productive forces which are their material
exponents. But
in actual fact the relations of production do not exist apart from the
productive forces.</p>
<p>Having developed a scientific
method of
studying economic phenomena, Marx and Engels left far behind, from a
methodological standpoint, bourgeois political economy whose best
representatives
still failed to "split" the category of social production as well as
other economic categories. Bourgeois economists failed to solve this
problem
because they strove, wittingly or unwittingly, to present the economic
laws of
capitalism as the eternal laws of nature. The conception of social
production
as a unity of the productive forces and the relations of production, on
the
contrary, made it possible to view history as a succession of social
formations, a succession of different modes of social production.</p>
<p>In <i>Capital</i> Marx gave a
classical
analysis of the process of capitalist production. Throughout the
process of
advancing from the abstract to the concrete Marx considers each
economic
category&#8212;the commodity, money, capital, etc.&#8212;from the point of view of
the
dialectical unity of material content, which ultimately reflects the
development of the productive forces, and social form, which reflects
the
capitalist relations of production. Marx pointed out: "... neither
'value'
nor 'exchange-value' are the categories I consider, but the <i>commodity</i>."
<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[60]</a>
The
commodity, as a unity of the use-value (the material content) and value
(the
social form) constitutes the elementary "economic cell-form" of
bourgeois society, and as such is the point of departure for
theoretical
analysis in <i>Capital</i>.</p>
<p>It is the distinction between
the social
form of an economic phenomenon and its material content that determines
the
limits of abstraction permissible in each individual case, the limits
within
which one may proceed from the concrete to the abstract. Marx applies
this
yardstick both to very general problems&#8212;e.g., the antagonistic
character of
bourgeois production and its material content, the "economic
cell-form" of bourgeois society&#8212;and to more concrete, special
questions,
e.g., productive labour under capitalism. But important as it is to
differentiate between the social form and material content of economic
phenomena, any dissociation from the social form of economic phenomena
investigated is <i>impermissible</i>. In other words, the
economic
categories
giving expression to economic phenomena cannot he deduced independently
of the
relations of production (the relations of production are the social
form of
economic phenomena), merely from the material characteristics, from the
material content of the phenomena. Bourgeois political economy does not
take
into consideration the antagonistic form of capitalist production and
regards
its laws as dominant in all formations. That was the reason why
bourgeois
economists failed to discover and analyse the "economic cell-form" of
capitalism.</p>
<p>But the question of determining
the social
form and material content of an economic phenomenon has also another
side to
it. Whereas specific features of economic phenomena and processes
peculiar to a
particular mode of production can be deduced solely from their social
form, the
study of their material content makes it possible to establish and
describe the
general characteristics and attributes common to all (or to some) modes
of production.
This is what makes it possible to apply Marxist economic theory to the
analysis
of socialist production, to scientific forecasting in a communist
economy. For
example, Lenin's well-known proposition that under "pure communism"
too the Marxist formulas of extended reproduction (they are stated in
Volume II
of <i>Capital</i>) will be operative and accumulation will
go on <a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[61]</a>
proceeds
from the material basis of Marx's schemes of reproduction.</p>
<p>In <i>Capital</i> Marx makes a
clear
distinction every time between the material content of the capitalist
mode of
production on the one hand,and its antagonistic social form on the
other. It is
here, in the descriptions of the material content of the capitalist
economic
system, that the great mass of material is found which forms the
groundwork of
the Marxist theory of the communist mode of production. Marx's
conclusions on
the communist economic system follow each time directly from his
economic theory,
from the analysis of the material content of the economic processes
going on
under capitalism. Every time Marx casts aside the antagonistic social
form
which distorts, in capitalist conditions, the actual material content
of the
economic processes studied, and this enables him to predict
scientifically (not
like the Utopian socialists with their usual practice of
crystal-gazing) how
these processes will develop under communism. In the third part of this
book we
shall deal with some of the forecasts made by Marx. And now it remains
to
describe one of the most important aspects of Marx's method, thanks to
which it
serves as a method of scientific abstraction.</p>
<h2>3. The Force of Abstraction</h2>
<p>The title of this section comes
from a
quotation in the Foreword to Volume I of <i>Capital</i> in
which Marx
wrote:
"In the analysis of economic forms, moreover, neither microscopes or
chemical reagents are of use. The force of abstraction must replace
both."
<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[62]</a>
Why must
abstraction be used in scientific study? It is because in real life
things are
usually not what they seem. The object of science is to penetrate
through the
appearance to the essence of things. Abstraction is just what enables
science
to tackle this highly complex task. "Thought proceeding from the
concrete
to the abstract&#8212;provided it is <i>correct</i>. . . does
not get away <i>f
r o m</i>
the truth but comes closer to it," Lenin wrote in the <i>Philosophical
Notebooks</i>. "The abstraction of <i>matter</i>, of
a <i>law</i> of
nature, the abstraction of <i>value</i>, etc., in short <i>all</i>
scientific
(correct, serious, not absurd) abstractions reflect nature more deeply,
truly
and <i>c o m p l e t e l y</i>." <a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[63]</a></p>
<p>In applying the method of
scientific
abstraction it is most important to determine the <i>degree of
abstraction</i>
necessary in each case. There is no ready-made formula for this. One
thing is
clear. In every case Marx abstracts secondary, inessential points which
encumber the investigation of the subject. Without that kind of
abstraction it
would be plainly impossible &nbsp;to study things, as their essence
would be
concealed or camouflaged by numerous side issues. Even so it must be
stressed -
and is what makes it so difficult to determine the necessary degree of
abstraction - that the secondary facts from which Marx abstracts are
secondary
only as regards a particular case. In another case, viewed from a
different
aspect, they may lie of primary importance and by no means to be
abstracted
from.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples. In his
investigation Marx based himself on the fact that the wage, or the
price of
labour-power, the capitalist pays to the worker is equal to its value,
although
in bourgeois practice there is a stable tendency for lowering wages in
various
ways, below the value of labour-power. Marx, however, pointed out: "We
must always presuppose here that the wage paid is <i>economically</i>
just,
i.e. that it is determined by the general laws of economics. The
contradictions
have to follow here from the general relations themselves, and not from
fraud
by individual capitalists.'' <a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[64]</a>
It is worth noting that by the "general laws of economics" Marx means
above all the law of value. And Marx's economic theory explains
capitalist
exploitation on the basis of the law of value and not in conflict with
it, not
because of "fraud by individual capitalists." Nevertheless, in other
cases, at a more concrete level of study, in analysing the dynamics of
wages,
their deviation from the value of labour-power can no longer be
neglected.</p>
<p>Abstraction from actual
deviation of the
price of labour-power from its value is a particular example of a more
general
assumption made by Marx throughout <i>Capital</i> by which
<i>price
is equated
to value</i>. The thing is that all economic laws and categories,
like
all the
social laws of capitalism in general, in actual practice emerge merely
as
tendencies, in a roundabout way, or, as Engels put it, "...only with
asymptotic approximation." <a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[65]</a>
However, in his economic theory Marx proceeds on the assumption that
theoretical categories are <i>exact</i> expressions of
economic
phenomena. This
feature of Marx's method is particularly evident from his postulation
of the
identity of commodity values and market prices. In Volume III of <i>Capital</i>
Marx wrote: "We proceed in this entire analysis from the assumption
that
the rise or fall in prices expresses actual fluctuations in value.'' <a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[66]</a>
At the
first glance this assumption seems to be in contradiction with the
principles
of the Marxist theory of value. After all it is in the deviation of the
market
price from value that the law of value is realised under the anarchic
capitalist commodity production. "The possibility, therefore, of
quantitative incongruity between price and magnitude of value, or the
deviation
of the former from the latter," Marx writes in the first volume of <i>Capital</i>,
"is inherent in the price-form itself." <a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[67]</a>
Nonetheless Marx bases his analysis of value on the assumption of the
identity
of a market price and the value of a commodity. Why?</p>
<p>Price - value expressed in
terms of money -
is the only possible expression of the value of a commodity. Value as
such,
"pure" value can only be expressed through price. (Sometimes,
toaccentuate
this fact, they speak of "exchange-value," thus pointing to the close
connection between value and exchange, the realisation of commodities
in the
market.) Under "normal" conditions of competition, when supply and
demand are equal, price is an adequate, accurate expression of value.
Why,
then, should prices deviate from value? The reason is the anarchy of
capitalist
production, the conditions under which commodities are realised, or
sold, in
the market. Market price depends on short-term factors operative in a
given
market at a given time, and accordingly may be either greater or
smaller than
the value of the commodity. As it deviates from value, the price no
longer
expresses value adequately. Therefore, if the goal is - as it is in <i>Capital</i>
- to evolve an economic theory on the basis of the law of value (value
finding
expression solely in money, i.e., in price), then price should he
regarded as
equal to value, as price will not adequately express value otherwise.
Consequently, just as it is normal in real life for market price to <i>deviate</i>
from value, so is it necessary in working out an economic theory to
neglect the
fluctuations and regard value and market price as equivalent. The
conditions of
sale are, in this case, merely incidental, a matter of redistribution
of value
already produced. They can only blur the picture.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the price of
production,
as we saw, is, in principle, not equal to value because the
transformation of
surplus-value into average profit occurs through total surplus-value
produced
by capital being redistributed among different capitals invested in
different
branches of production.</p>
<p>Lastly, here are two more
examples
illustrating the method of scientific abstraction. In "... an abstract
study of bourgeois society," this method requires "... leaving foreign
trade out of account." <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[68]</a>
Although foreign trade plays an immense role under capitalism, it is an
extraneous factor as regards the capitalist mode of production as such.
Hence
Marx builds his theory of this mode of production, in its main aspects,
without
taking account of foreign trade. Suffice it to recall the brilliant
explanation
he gave of extended reproduction under capitalism, founded entirely on
the
internal conditions of the bourgeois economy. As we know, Lenin, in a
polemical
articles on Russia's economic future, devoted much effort to the
defence and
substantiation of this principle of Marx.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time Marx
points out that
"...foreign trade and ... the world market ... are at once the
precondition and the result of capitalist production." <a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[69]</a></p>
<p>Considered as it really is, in <i>concrete</i>
conditions, capitalist production would be greatly impeded, or not even
possible, in the absence of foreign trade. In this connection Marx
observes:
"If surplus-labour or surplus-value were represented only in the
national
surplus product, then the increase of value for the sake ofvalue
&nbsp;and therefore
the exaction of surplus-tabour would be restricted by the limited,
narrow
circle of use-values in which the value of the [national] labour would
be
represented. But it is foreign trade which develops its [the surplus
product's]
real nature as value." <a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[70]</a>
Thus, without foreign trade and the world market, it would be extremely
difficult to achieve the very purpose of capitalist production, i.e.,
the
extraction of profit. Here we have a striking example of the <i>concrete
historical</i> character of the Marxist method of scientific
abstraction:
foreign trade, which is a secondary, incidental factor, for instance,
in the theory
of reproduction, comes to the fore when the mechanism of the operation
of
capitalist economy is considered concretely.</p>
<p>The other example we should
like to cite
here is concerned with the Ricardian theory of rent which Marx analysed
in his
draft for the fourth volume of <i>Capital: Theories of
Surplus-Value</i>.
Although of a strictly special character, this example is of a general
methodological significance for it demonstrates how the method of
scientific
abstraction should&#8212;and how it should
not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
be used.</p>
<p>The Ricardian theory of rent
presupposes
the free movement of capital in agriculture. Ricardo's opponents
objected that
his theory of rent failed to take into account the difficulty of
withdrawing
capital from agriculture for a farmer with much fixed capital. Marx
finds this
objection "quite correct" and points out that "The history of
England from 1815 to 1830 provides <i>strong</i> proof for
this."
Nevertheless, Marx goes on, this objection "does <i>not in any
way</i>
affect the theory, it leaves it <i>quite untouched</i>,
because in
this case it
is invariably only a question of the more or less rapid or slow
operation of
the economic law." <a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[71]</a>
That capital is difficult to withdraw does not depend on the essence of
the
economic law&#8212;the law of ground-rent in this case&#8212;but on its external
form, on
the way it operates, i.e., on external factors which should be
abstracted from.</p>
<p>However, the Ricardian theory
of rent also
presupposes free investment of capital in agriculture. On this point
Marx
resolutely sides with Ricardo's opponents, pointing out that
penetration of
capital into agriculture is resisted by landlords. Ricardo, in fact,
abstracted
from the monopoly of private land ownership. Marx calls this
abstraction
basically fallacious as this monopoly determines the very existence of
ground-rent and consequently affects the very foundations of this
branch of
bourgeois economy.</p>
<p>From these examples two
conclusions may be
drawn. First, that the general methodological principle underlying
Marx's
theory is analysis of a "pure" capitalist mode of production. This is
plainly seen in the theory of surplus-value which regards surplus-value
per se,
independently of its derivatives - profit, rent and interest. Second,
it
follows from the same methodological principle that Marx's economic
theory, set
forth in <i>Capital</i>, is highly <i>abstract</i>.
For instance,
examining in <i>Capital</i>
the structure of bourgeois society, Marx assumed the capitalist mode of
production to be completely predominant, although it was not so in
fact. </p>
<p>The strictly scientific,
theoretical, or
abstract character of Marx's economic doctrine is clearly expressed
also in its
structure, worked out in 1857-58. Marx divided the whole material into
six volumes:
(I) on capital; (II) on land property; (III) on wage-labour; (IV) on
the state;
(V) international trade; (VI) the world market. It is not hard to see
that this
plan follows the method of advancing from the abstract to the concrete,
and
reflects the objective structure of bourgeois economy. The plan of Book
I, in
which Marx's economic studies are concentrated, was outlined as
follows: (a)
capital in general; (b) competition of capitals; (c) credit; (d)
joint-stock
capital. The first section, on capital in general, has the following
subdivisions: (1) production of capital; (2) circulation of capital;
(3)
capital and profit. It will not escape the reader that the latter
subdivision
actually represents the structure of three volumes of <i>Capital</i>.
This proves
once again the high level of abstraction in <i>Capital</i>.</p>
<p>Thus in the first section of
Book I all the
diverse phenomena of capitalist economy were to be considered
exclusively from
the angle of production and appropriation of surplus-value. Separately
from
this analysis, and on the basis of it, were to be examined the
relatively
independent, more concrete categories: competition, credit and
joint-stock
capital. It soon became clear to Marx that he would be able to carry
through
only a part of his vast programme. On March 11, 1858, he wrote that it
was by
no means his intention to develop all six books to an equal extent. And
in 1862
Marx wrote that <i>Capital</i> "contains what the English
call the
principles of political economy. It is the quintessence ...and the
development
of the rest ...could be easily accomplished by others on the basis thus
provided." <a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[72]</a>
The high degree of abstraction characteristic of Marx's theory is its
great
merit which has made it viable and applicable in circumstances rather
different
from those of its own day. But it also follows from the general,
abstract
character of Marxist theory that it cannot be applied <i>directly</i>
in
studying another epoch or other conditions in the same epoch, that it
provides
merely the <i>starting points</i> for such studies because
reality is
completely different from its abstract (theoretical) model. Marx was
perfectly
aware of the need of giving his theory a concrete basis. That, above
all, was
why he undertook in the 1870s and early 80s a broad study of the
economies of
Russia and the United States which quite obviously went beyond the
framework of
<i>Capital</i>.</p>
<p>Marxist economic theory, based
on British
capitalism, which was classical when Marx lived, had to be supplemented
by some
<i>intermediate</i> links to make it applicable to analysis
Of the
trends of
economic development of such "non-classical" countries as Russia.
Marx actually stated as much in a letter to the magazine <i>Otechestvenniye
zapiski</i>:
"In order that I might be specially qualified to estimate the economic
development of Russia, I learnt Russian and then for many years studied
the
official publications and others bearing on this subject." Marx goes on
to
say that one cannot hope to understand concrete economic processes "by
using as one's master key a general historico-philosophical theory." <a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[73]</a>
Marx did
not live to carry his studies through to the end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but a series of
works
written by Lenin in the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1890's
terminating with <i>The Development of
Capitalism in Russia</i>, is the logical continuation of the last
economic
studies by Marx. The fact that the drafts of <i>Capital</i>
and the
preliminary
sketches of <i>The Development of Capitalism in Russia</i>
follow
parallel
patterns is striking evidence that we have to do here with the rigid
requirements of the Marxist method of research which rules that the one
and
only way to proceed from abstract theory to concrete economic facts is
to study
the latter and explain the logic of their development. And by merely
superimposing the theoretical model on the economy as it is, one
arrives at the
false conclusion that the theory presumably lacks confirmation. Already
in this
early work Lenin wrote: "...the explanation of how capitalism develops <i>in
general</i> does not in the least help to clear up the question
of the
'possibility' (and necessity) of the development of capitalism in
Russia."
In 1894 Lenin pointed out that the application of Marx's theory to
Russia
"can be only the INVESTIGATION of Russian production relations and
their
evolution, EMPLOYING the established practices of the MATERIALIST
method and of
THEORETICAL political economy." The sole criterion by which the
correctness of the investigation could be measured was "the facts of
contemporary Russian economic reality." <a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[74]</a></p>
<p>It must be noted that the
concrete studies
of the Russian economy undertaken by Marx and Lenin were necessitated
from the
methodological point of view also by the need to proceed from the
concrete to
the abstract, which is an absolutely indispensable part of the process
of
theoretical investigation. In this respect too Lenin's studies provide
a
brilliant example of the employment of Marx's method. Marxist criticism
of
Narodism (the ideology of peasant democracy in Russia) had been voiced
long before
Lenin's works appeared, but it was based on the general principles of
Marx's
theory, exemplified by individual facts characterising Russian economic
reality. Lenin was the first Marxist to carry out an investigation
proceeding
from the concrete to the abstract &#8211; from examination of the total body
of
evidence on Russia's development after the 1861 reform to a general
summing-up
of this evidence showing that the trend of economic growth in Russia
concurred
with the general tendencies of capitalism set out in Marx's economic
theory.
This, in effect, meant that capitalism was inexorably developing in
Russia.
Simultaneously, it was a conclusive refutation of the Narodist doctrine
which
denied the historical revolutionary mission of the proletariat.</p>
<p>Lenin's studies of the Russian
economy are,
as we see, of a general methodological significance. But Lenin, the
great
revolutionary, also gave concrete form to Marx's economic doctrine,
bringing it
to bear on the entirely different historical epoch of imperialism and
transition to socialism. This fact makes Lenin's theoretical legacy an
absolutely indispensable part of modern Marxism. Just as we could say
modern
physics is inconceivable without Einstein's theory of relativity, so we
could
say it would be impossible to study modern capitalism without Lenin's
economic
works. We shall see this for ourselves in the third part of this book.
For the
present let us note that the characteristic. features of Marx's method
of
economic study we have discussed show that it is a method of dialectics
applied
to a particular sphere, that of the capitalist economy.</p>
<p>The two aspects of Marx's
method that are
the most essential in our view are its <i>materialist</i>
and its <i>concrete-historical</i>
character. A materialist approach to the analysis of economic reality
requires
the deduction of economic laws from the objective conditions of the
process of
production itself. Hence, the economic laws, which explain the essence
of
economic phenomena, must be at the same time material laws. This gives
concrete
form to one of the most important principles of the materialist
conception of
history, viz., the primacy of material production (which was discussed
in the
first part of this book). A concrete historical approach to the
analysis of
economy requires that economic laws be viewed as historical laws
deduced from
given economic conditions, which operate only with respect to these
conditions,
and change following a change in the latter. This aspect of Marx's
method too
is a concrete form of Marxist dialectics which demands that "each
proposition should be
considered&nbsp;(&#945;) only
historically, (&#946;)
only in connection with others, (&#947;) only in connection with the
concrete experience of
history." <a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[75]</a></p>
<p>The present writer is aware
that the reader
may have found the contents of this part of the book rather too
abstract and difficult.
Yet, he is convinced that anyone who wants to have a clear idea of
Marx's
theory and of how it is applied in finding solutions to the fundamental
issues
of our times, must understand these principles on which it is based.</p>

The main one was that commodily-producing labour was treated as "a
single
whole." It was conceived as simply labour, existing in every historical
period, and not as specific social labour characteristic of bourgeois
society.</p>
