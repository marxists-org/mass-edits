<h3>PART&nbsp; III A THEORY
PROJECTED INTO THE FUTURE</h3>
<p>Evolved
more than a century ago, Marxist
theory and its methods are applied with increasing success to the study
of
present-day reality - (socialist as well as capitalist): to the
solution of
concrete social problems of today. An immense contribution in this
respect, as
we have already noted, was made by Lenin, who was the first to apply
Marx's
doctrine creatively to the study of an entirely different historical
epoch, the
epoch of imperialism and proletarian revolutions, in which the
worldwide
transition to socialism has begun. Out of the multitude of contemporary
problems we shall select three groups of questions for discussion: (1)
Lenin's
analysis of imperialism; (2) the position of the working class and he
class
struggle in contemporary capitalist society, and (3) some theoretical
problems
of a communist economy. Our object is to point out to the reader the
underlying
tendencies of social development which Marx explained in <i>Capital</i>
and
which are basic to the study of the problems referred to.</p>
<h2>1. Analysis of Imperialism.
Starting Points</h2>
<p>In
his analysis of imperialism Lenin based
himself on the economic doctrine of Marx, who, Lenin wrote, "by a
theoretical and historical analysis of capitalism had proved that free
competition gives rise to the concentration of production, which, in
turn, at a
certain stage of development, leads to monopoly." <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[76]</a>
The fact
that Lenin's investigation of imperialism is founded on Marx's economic
doctrine and is its direct continuation shows that this doctrine
contained all
the necessary starting points enabling Lenin to carry out his
investigation
within the framework of Marx's theory. What were these starting points?</p>
<p>The
fact that capitalism has entered an
entirely new stage of development had already been partly observed by
Engels,
as is clear from some notes and addenda he supplied to Volume III of <i>Capital</i>
in the 1880s and 90s, mentioning the appearance of "new forms" of
capitalist concerns such as industrial and finance monopolies, the
increase in
export of capital, the division of the world among the largest
companies, and
so on. But of still greater importance was the fact that the <i>theory
of
capitalist monopoly</i> on which Lenin founded his investigation
of monopoly
capitalism was developed in <i>Capital</i>.</p>
<p>Pre-monopoly
capitalism, which Marx
investigated, was of course capitalism of free competition. Still,
competition
existed along with diverse forms of monopoly. First of all, the
capitalist mode
of production as such is based on the <i>monopoly of ownership
of the principal
means of production by the ruling class</i>, the capitalists.
Marx wrote:
"...it is the <i>monopoly</i> of capital alone that
enables the capitalist
to squeeze surplus-labour out of the worker..." <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[77]</a>
Further,
Marx shows that the price of production is formed on the basis of
capitalist
competition in the conditions of the monopoly of capitalist ownership
of the
means of production. This is why similar goods appearing in the market
at the
same time must have one and the same, social, price of production and
therefore
the same market price. The social price of production ensures average
profit to
the whole capitalist class. "The capitalists," Marx wrote, "like
hostile brothers, divide among themselves the loot of other people's
labour which
they have appropriated so that on an average one receives the same
amount of
unpaid labour as another." <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[78]</a>
Thus, as regards its exploitation of the working class, the capitalist
class
represents a single whole.</p>
<p>Yet
the <i>level</i> of the social price of
production is fixed by a group of capitalists dominating the market,
who
receive super-profit because their individual cost-price is lower than
the
social cost-price on which the social price of production depends.
Under free
competition the super-profit is temporary, "fluid." It disappears as
soon as the other capitalists, by introducing technical innovations,
manage to
close the gap, improve the conditions of production, lower the
cost-price and
catch up with the capitalists in the leading group. Although highly
unstable,
super-profit does not altogether vanish but merely passes from one
group of
capitalists to another. The struggle for super-profit is the pivot of
capitalist competition.</p>
<p>Apart
from the monopoly of capitalist
ownership of the means of production shared by the whole capitalist
class, and
apart from the monopoly position, within this class, of individual
groups of
capitalists dominating the market, there exists, under the specific
conditions
of capitalist agriculture, also a monopoly of the whole class of
landowners and
of separate groups within it, owning the best land. This form of
monopoly
ensures ground-rent to the landowners.</p>
<p>The
most important expression of monopoly
domination is <i>monopoly price</i> which contains <i>monopoly
super-profit</i>,
over and above the average profit. The monopoly super-profit. obtained
by a
group of capitalists which dominates the market because of lower
cost-price,
essentially differs from the monopoly super-profit obtained as
ground-rent by
landowners in that the latter form of monopoly super-profit is <i>permanent</i>,
not temporary. It is the same monopoly, Marx wrote, which "...occurs in
all spheres of industry and only becomes permanent in this one, hence
assuming
the form of rent as distinct from excess profit." <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[79]</a>
That was
why Marx chose capitalist monopoly in agriculture as a convenient
object for
the study of capitalist monopoly in general.</p>
<p>It is
an important feature of Marx's theory
of capitalist monopoly that it explains monopoly price on the basis of
the law
of value. Earlier we dwelt on the important part the criterion of value
plays
in Marx's economic theory. In this case too Marx showed that while it
converts
the price of production into a <i>monopoly price of production</i>,
monopoly
super-profit does not affect the mechanism of price formation operating
in
bourgeois society. In fact, monopoly super-profit is the difference
between the
social price of production and the individual price of production at
enterprises with the lowest cost-price.</p>
<p>Another
important characteristic of
capitalist monopoly is that it is not absolute but exists within the
framework
of capitalist <i>competition</i>. This extends even to the
monopoly of land
ownership, which loses effect only "if the owner is himself the farmer,
and therefore in this <i>individual case</i> landed
property <i>does not</i>
confront capital." <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[80]</a></p>
<p>The
theory of capitalist monopoly lucidly
describes the economic means by which the capitalists and the landed
proprietors ensure their own dominant position in bourgeois society and
ensure
the exploitation of the working class and all other working people. At
the same
time, the theory shows that only by abolishing the capitalist relations
of
production is it possible to end all forms of capitalist monopoly and
all the
attendant forms of exploitation, viz., the monopoly of the capitalist
class as
a whole getting average profit; the monopoly of the big capitalists
additionally reaping super-profit; and the monopoly of the landowners
drawing
rent.</p>
<p>Under
modern capitalism, the problem of
monopoly price is of fundamental importance. Imperialism is
characterised above
all by monopoly domination, and monopoly price is the economic form in
which
this domination is realised. In the theory of imperialism worked out by
Lenin
monopoly price is, of course, explained, and it is explained in full
accordance
with the methodological requirements of Marx's theory of capitalist
monopoly.
This we shall presently proceed to demonstrate.</p>
<p>In <i>Imperialism,
the Highest Stage of
Capitalism</i> (1916) Lenin shows that in the epoch of
imperialism the rapid
growth of concentration of production logically gives rise to monopoly.
This
process causes production to be amalgamated on an enormous scale.
Monopoly
enterprises are at the same time technologically the most advanced, and
this
means that their individual cost-price is appreciably <i>lower</i>
than the
average social cost-price of production in a given industry. This makes
for a
stable difference between social and individual cost-price, i.e., it
provides a
stable source of monopoly super-profit. Thus, in the United States big
corporations with a capital of more than a hundred million dollars,
obtain per
dollar of products sold more than three times as much profit as small
concerns,
with a capital less than a million dollars.</p>
<p>Under
modern capitalism the technological
superiority of monopoly enterprises is stable and enduring enough to
ensure a
practically constant monopoly super-profit. The Soviet scholar, Ya.
Pevzner,
justly observes in this connection: "Production and property have
become
so centralised that in every country the process of competition has
advanced
from a few dozen to some hundred capitalists big enough to enjoy a
well-nigh
impregnable position."<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[81]</a>
The monopolies extend their hold by diverse means, seizing sources of
raw
materials, amalgamating production, buying up patents, intentionally
stimulating the organisation of relatively: small-size enterprises with
higher
cost-price, and so forth. As a result, the individual cost-price of
monopoly
concerns is permanently lower than the social cost-price in the same
industry.</p>
<p>Further,
it is very important that monopoly
super-profit is available not only when the social price of production
(which
continues to regulate prices under the monopoly system as well)
increases but
also when it does not change or even when it drops. Quite obviously,
the growth
of the social price of production - which the monopolies encourage in
every wayleads
to the growth of super-profit. A case in point is the recent behaviour
of the
oil monopolies which seized upon the growing demand for energy to
increase
their fabulous profits still more.</p>
<p>But
monopoly super-profit may be available
and may even increase also when the social price of production
diminishes,
depending on whether the individual cost-price at monopoly enterprises
diminishes. If, for instance, it diminishes to a greater extent than
the social
price of production, then the monopoly super-profit increases. Lenin
pointed
out in this connection that the possibility of reducing the cost-price
and
increasing profits by introducing technological improvements <a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[82]</a>
was an
important stimulus to development under imperialism as well, which
offset
another tendency, also induced by monopoly price, the tendency towards
decay,
towards the artificial slowing down of the growth of production.</p>
<p>At
the same time, monopoly super-profit,
resulting from the inflated social price of production, very clearly
shows how
under imperialism the fruits of the technological progress of society
are
appropriated by a handful of monopolists who increase their profits at
the expense
of society. Marx wrote in <i>Capital</i>, bearing in mind
the landlords, that
society "overpays for agricultural products in its capacity of
consumer." <a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[83]</a>
Under modern capitalism, under monopoly domination, monopoly prices and
monopoly super-profits, society is overpaying not only for agricultural
products but generally for all products made or sold by monopolies.</p>
<p>In
his theory of imperialism Lenin
repeatedly stressed that the monopolies exist and operate in a
situation of
ruthless competition. This fact confirms yet again that the value
mechanism
operates under modern conditions, too. Of course, the existence of
monopolies
impedes the formation of average profit and the price of production,
yet it
cannot abolish this tendency altogether. </p>
<p>The
fact that Lenin's theory of imperialism
is the natural sequel of Marx's economic doctrine is of fundamental
significance for the substantiation of the theory of scientific
communism in
the current epoch. The epoch of imperialism, Lenin showed, has been
marked by
an enormous intensification of the exploitation of the working people
by the
ruling classes, exploitation which nevertheless proceeds, as before,
within the
framework of the general objective tendencies of capitalism. Lenin
observes in
this connection that pure imperialism simply does not exist, that it
still is a
superstructure resting on the old capitalism, on the old basis, out of
which it
grows and which it modifies and adjusts to its own needs, but which it
is
unable to destroy. This means that the conclusion about the necessity
of the
socialist revolution, which followed from Marx's doctrine, has been
fully
corroborated in the current epoch. At the same time, his study of
imperialism
suggested to Lenin entirely new conclusions on the possibility of the
socialist
revolution. Lenin has shown that this possibility at present has grown
enormously, owing above all to essential changes in the process of
amalgamation
of production, viz., the development of the monopolies, and the
development of
monopoly capitalism into state-monopoly capitalism, which means the
fullest
possible material preparation for socialism.</p>
<p>Since
Lenin's death fifty years ago these
processes have made considerable headway. Monopoly has moved from
industry to
all other economic branches. The relation between monopoly and other
forms of
economy has altered a great deal. The monopolies have largely brought
under
their control non-monopoly production and established their control, in
one way
or another, over agriculture, the largest branch of non-monopoly
production.
The complexity of the organisational forms of industrial and banking
monopolies, of the forms of finance capital, has greatly increased. The
highest
form of monopoly, state-monopoly capitalism, representing the merger of
monopoly power and state power has developed to an extraordinary extent.</p>
<p>Bourgeois
economists declare state
intervention in the economy to be a new era in the history of
capitalism. In
this era, they say, the nature of capitalism has undergone a
fundamental change
and the economy emerging as a result of this change is not capitalist
but
"collectivistic." The state of the epoch of state-monopoly capitalism
is called the "welfare state."</p>
<p>Is
this really so? Has the modern
capitalist state indeed ceased to be what Marx called it &nbsp;-
"concentration
of bourgeois society in the form of the state" <a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[84]</a>-a
committee for the management of the bourgeoisie's affairs? Has society
ceased
to he bourgeois? It is common knowledge that the capitalist state
mobilises
huge funds to finance the monopolies. Its economic role at present is
characterised by the growing proportion of nationalised industries,
larger
investments in the economy and the growth of mixed joint-stock
companies in
which state and private-monopoly capital participates, and by attempts
at
economic programming by the state. The capitalist state plays an
exceptionally
big role in the militarisation of the economy. In the United States, a
lion's
share of the budget expenditure is allocated to military purposes.
These
constant injections into the military budget sustain monopoly profits
at a high
level, ensuring new investment opportunities for the monopolies.</p>
<p>The
greater role of the state in the
economy of modern capitalism is represented by its apologists as the
abolition
of capitalist property. But what state-monopoly capitalism seeks to do,
above
all, is to preserve the system of private property, to effect a
redistribution
of national wealth for the monopolies' benefit. Amalgamating production
on a
vast scale, so as to safeguard the positions of capitalism,
state-monopoly
capitalism exacerbates the contradictions of capitalism, making the
replacement
of capitalist production relations by socialist production relations an
urgent
necessity.</p>
<p>State-monopoly
capitalism is developing
under conditions of a scientific and technological revolution. New
sources of
energy are introduced in production which has become automated and
machines
begin to replace man in management, not only in production. Science
becomes a
direct productive force. On this basis the productivity of labour
increases
enormously. Yet, does the revolution in science and technology make the
social
revolution unnecessary? Are the capitalist and socialist social systems
drawing
closer together, as the supporters of the "convergence" theory
allege? The answer is provided by analysis of the place occupied by the
working
class in the structure of modern bourgeois society. This analysis
unequivocally
confirms that the examination of the position of the working class
under
capitalism, carried out in <i>Capital</i>, is perfectly
correct. This will be
dealt with in the next section.</p>
<h2>2. Marx's Economic Theory and
the Working Class</h2>
<p>Having
evolved the theory of surplus-value
and explained the mechanism of capitalist exploitation, Marx showed
that capital
was stored-up unpaid labour. This was a grave accusation made against
the
capitalists on behalf of the working class. But Marx went much farther
than
that. He showed (and we mentioned this earlier) that the appropriation
of the
workers' unpaid labour by the capitalists occurs on the basis of
capitalism's
inherent laws. It followed from this that the working class could only
be
liberated from capitalist exploitation by revolutionary means alone -
by
destroying the capitalist system. This conclusion is of exceptional
significance today too, for it dispels all illusions about it being
possible to
alter radically the position of the working class by reforms, while
leaving
intact the capitalist relations of production.</p>
<p>Criticising
petty-bourgeois reformism, Marx
did not in any way imply that economic reforms were useless or had no
influence
on the capitalist economic system. But he wanted it to be clearly
understood
that no reforms of this kind could affect the foundations of the
capitalist
system. "It is necessary to see this clearly," he wrote meaning the
Proudhonian projects for a monetary reform of capitalism, "in order to
avoid setting impossible tasks, and in order to know the limits within
which
monetary reforms and transformations of circulation are able to give a
new
shape to the relations of production and to the social relations which
rest on
the latter." <a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[85]</a></p>
<p>Arguing
that it was necessary to overthrow
bourgeois domination in a revolutionary way and to establish a
dictatorship of
the proletariat, Marx and Engels repeatedly stressed that the social
revolution
"might be effected entirely by peaceful and legal means," although,
in view of the conditions in which capitalism developed at that time,
they
added that the ruling classes could hardly be expected "to submit,
without
a 'pro-slavery rebellion,' to this peaceful and legal revolution." <a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[86]</a></p>
<p>The
bloody events in Chile have confirmed
this prediction. Nevertheless, the programmes of many Marxist parties
in
capitalist countries are based on the possibility of a peaceful
development of
the socialist revolution. The Marxist conclusion that the revolution is
necessary certainly does not imply that the peaceful struggle of the
working
class to improve its economic and social position in bourgeois society
is unnecessary
or useless. This struggle, however, is regarded by genuine Marxists and
revolutionaries as essential factor in the abolition of the capitalist
system.</p>
<p>In
his economic theory Marx always drew a
clear distinction between the material content of capitalist economy,
the
progressive tendencies of its development stemming from the objective
laws of
large-scale industry, and its reactionary tendencies deriving from its
antagonistic social form. Marx showed that it was the progressive
tendencies in
capitalism that determine the possibility of its being superseded by
communism.
This fundamental principle of Marxist theory gives the clue to the
analysis of
new economic and political developments, such as integration,
nationalisation
of industry, capitalist programming, and so on, that the working-class
movement
in the capitalist countries has currently to deal with.</p>
<p>Marxist
parties come out against a dogmatic
denial of the importance of the specific conditions for the workers'
struggle
brought about by these developments. Thus, far from denying the obvious
fact
that in capitalist society nationalised industries have nothing
socialist about
them, the working class in all capitalist countries is fighting for the
further
extension of the public sector of the economy, against the monopolies'
efforts
to return some industries to the private sector. In this case Marxists
take
into account the basic trends of modern social development. In an age
of rapid
progress of the productive forces, the state's active intervention in
the
economy (e.g., nationalisation of industry) is an objective necessity.
Long
ago, Engels considered these measures on the part of the bourgeois
state
"an economic advance, the attainment of another step preliminary to the
taking over of all productive forces by society itself." <a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[87]</a></p>
<p>While
the monopolies seek to neutralise the
democratic content of nationalisation, the working class fights for
democratic,
anti-monopoly forms of nationalisation, for extending nationalisation
as much
as possible and turning it into an instrument to curb monopoly rule. In
this
nationalisation is an important instrument for breaking up the modern
capitalist system and reorganising society along socialist lines.</p>
<p>The
Marxists pay most serious attention to
the problem of capitalist integration, to the tendency of
state-monopoly
regulation of economic development both on the international and
national
scale. In present conditions integration is doubtlessly a means of
enhancing
monopoly control. The Marxist method, however, demands that analysis of
the
reactionary monopolistic form of integration be supplemented by
analysis of its
material content and that integration should be viewed also as a
reflection of
the progressive tendencies of the development of the productive forces.</p>
<p>Marxists
are fighting for democratic forms
of integration, counterposing to the Common Market the conception of an
undivided Europe, the restoration of a world market, and the
development of the
international division of labour as the economic basis of peaceful
coexistence
of capitalism and socialism. This struggle calls for a strengthening of
international solidarity of the working class in order to frustrate the
monopolies' efforts to keep the workers' living standards as low as
possible
and in order that the working people in all countries benefit from each
other's
achievements. The democratic alternative to monopoly integration can
succeed
only if it has international scope.</p>
<p>One
of the most important conclusions of
Marx's economic theory, as we have seen, is that already in the womb of
capitalism there mature "the elements for a new and higher form," <a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[88]</a>
the
elements of the communist mode of production. Marx considered one of
such forms
workers' co-operative factories which provided evidence that the
capitalist was
not a necessary figure in production. Simultaneously Marx warned the
workers
that only by winning political power would they be able to develop
co-operative
effort on a nation-wide scale, i.e., to liberate the masses in fact.
Present-day co-operative societies in capitalist countries are mass
organisations numbering millions of members. In the cities they are
mostly
factory workers and office employees. Co-operative property does not
play any
appreciable role in industrial production, but it is of considerable
importance
in agriculture. The share of the co-operative societies in retail trade
turnover reaches as high as 15 per cent in some countries.</p>
<p>It
must be said that under present-clay
conditions, when enterprises are actually run by staff managers hired
by the
capitalists, the capitalists themselves are a still more unnecessary
element in
production.</p>
<p>Using
in the workers' interest the forms of
socialised labour developing already under capitalism, such as the
co-operative
movement (in agriculture as well) or democratic workers' control in
nationalised enterprises, the working class makes these forms the
jumping-off
ground for the further struggle against capital. This position has
nothing in
common with reformist illusions such as. for instance, the idea that
the
turning over of small shares to workers will lead to socialism.
Curiously
enough, Marx, long ago, commented on this form of social demagogy
describing
"a certain share in profits" as "a special way of cheating the
workers and of <i>deducting a part of their wages</i> in
the more precarious
form of a profit depending on the state of the business." <a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[89]</a>
Neither
nationalised nor joint-stock enterprises no matter how many shares
workers have
in them--alter the foundations of the social system. Still, these
elements of
transformation may lead towards such a change.</p>
<p>Describing
the immense revolutionary
significance of a theory giving a correct explanation of reality, Marx
wrote:
"Once the interconnection is grasped, all theoretical belief in the
permanent necessity of existing conditions collapses before their
collapse in
practice." <a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[90]</a>
Working for structural reforms, seeking to oust representatives of the
capitalist class from the management of nationalised enterprises and
enlist the
participation of working people in management, the working class seeks
to
ensure its own leadership of the economy even under capitalism. The
International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties (1969) stated
that
"In contrast to the Right and 'Left' opportunists, the Communist and
Workers' Parties do not counterpose the fight for deep-going economic
and
social demands, and for advanced democracy to the struggle for
socialism but
regard it as a part of the struggle for socialism. The radical
democratic
changes which will be achieved in the struggle against the monopolies
and their
economic domination and political power will promote among the broad
masses
awareness of the need for socialism." <a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[91]</a></p>
<p>A
salient feature of Marx's economic theory
as, incidentally, of the Marxist doctrine as a whole is its clear
social
character, its clear tendency to <i>action</i>, to
practical expression. To
know the world has always meant to a Marxist to transform it. The
objective
economic laws of bourgeois society are felt in the class struggle.</p>
<p>Marx
disclosed the objective tendency of
capitalist production towards the greatest possible exploitation of the
working
class. This tendency has been active throughout the entire history of
capitalism. The three stages Marx discovered in the development of
capitalism -
co-operation of labour; division of labour in manufacture; machinery -
are
nothing but three stages of the process of subjugation of labour by
capital.
Each stage was marked by a further increase of exploitation, longer
hours or
more intensive labour, lower wages.</p>
<p>Drawing
on extensive documentary material
Marx showed that as a result of this tendency labour-power was
prematurely
exhausted and destroyed and that nothing could moderate this tendency
except
stubborn resistance from the working class. Marx proved this
scientifically,
proceeding from his analysis of the value of labour-power which, unlike
the
value of all other commodities, is the sum of two elements. The value
of means
of subsistence is merely the <i>lowest</i> limit of the
value of labour-power,
its purely physical minimum. Apart from it, the value of labour-power
is
affected by cultural, historical and social factors, the traditional
standard
of living, etc. Even so, Marx observes, "the range of the so-called
prime
necessities of life and the manner of their satisfaction mostly depend
on the
cultural standard of society, ...are themselves a product of history." <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[92]</a>
The
lowest physical limit of the value of labour-power tends to fall (as a
result
of growing labour productivity and the diminishing value Of the means
of
subsistence) while its social limit <i>rises</i> as the
cultural and social
level of the working class becomes higher, and following the growing
complexity
of labour and higher skill requirements. Scientific and technological
revolution makes the growth of intellectual standards of the working
people a
socially necessary, gradually under stood need, the satisfaction of
which
capitalism tries to limit in every possible way. Hence the workers'
demands for
educational reforms, for access to culture, etc.</p>
<p>There
are also two aspects to the problem
of the length of the working day. The objective tendency of capitalism
is to
prolong the working day as much as possible and to make it as intensive
as
possible. The actual length of the working day, however, as well as the
amount
of wages, are determined in the course of the struggle between the
working
class and the capitalists. Capitalist society has a vested interest in
carrying
exploitation of the working class to the furthest extent possible.
Nothing but
organised resistance by the workers can restrain capitalist greed. Marx
stressed that "workers by themselves are unable - without acting as a
class to bring their pressure to bear on the state and through the
state on
capital - to rescue from the harpy claws of capital even the free time
needed
for their physical preservation." <a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[93]</a>
Thus Marx explained in economic terms why the workers in capitalist
countries
had to wage a struggle for shorter hours and higher wages.</p>
<p>Modern
state-monopoly capitalism which employs
every possible means of "rationalising" production is marked by
extremely intensified exploitation of the working class. In the 18(10s
Marx
calculated that the rate of exploitation of the workers in Britain,
which was
at that time the most highly developed capitalist country of all,
amounted to
100 per cent, i.e., half of the British workers' working hours were
unpaid. As
capitalism advanced, the worker was exploited not less but more. In
1899 the
rate of exploitation in manufacturing in the United States amounted to
128 per
cent, and in 1958 to 192 per cent. As we see, almost two in every three
hours
of work are unpaid. In the middle of this century 5 per cent of the US
population appropriated a third of the total national income, i.e., the
other
95 per cent of Americans accounted for two-thirds of the national
income.
According to a survey carried out by Letitia Upton and Nancy Lyons of
Cambridge
University, today the top twenty per cent of Americans own 77 per cent
of
personal wealth, which is three times more than the entire wealth of
the bottom
80 per cent. The bottom 20 per cent receive less than 6 per cent of
income,
while the 10.4 million families in the richest fifth take over 40 per
cent of
income. <a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[94]</a>
In this situation the struggle for higher wages and shorter hours is
just as when
Marx lived - the central form of the economic struggle of the working
class.</p>
<p>The
growth of wages in the post-war years
was the result of the workers' stubborn struggle which developed
particularly
in the late 1950s and early 60s. However, the reduction of hours put
into
effect in some capitalist countries in recent years was too
insignificant to
offset any appreciable increase in the intensity of labour. Today the
workers'
movement seeks to exert more influence on economic relations in
bourgeois
society, even on such as the concrete process of capitalist
reproduction, the
economic cycle. Experience shows that it is possible to utilise some
forms of
state-monopoly capitalism (e.g., to use state ownership with a view to
establishing
democratic workers' control or even to use the Common Market in order
to expose
the international collusion of the monopolies) in the interests of the
working
class, depending on how advanced the workers' movement is. In this
case, the
democratic anti-monopoly struggle against modern capitalism concurs
with the
socialist aspirations of the masses.</p>
<p>The
conclusions of Marx's economic doctrine
as regards the position of the working class are summed up in the
Marxist
theory of the <i>impoverishment</i> of working people in
bourgeois society, at
the basis of which is the universal law of capitalist accumulation
formulated
by Marx. Marxists have done a great deal in recent years to expose all
sorts of
absurd assertions about this theory by bourgeois and reformist writers.
First
of all they have criticised the attempt to replace the genuine Marxist
view by
an over-schematic conception of the alleged continuous automatic
process of
absolute impoverishment, absolute deterioration of the position of the
working
people under capitalism. The actual meaning of Marx's theory of
impoverishment
is that in bourgeois society the worker always works merely for
consumption;
the difference is whether his consumption costs are greater or smaller.
<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[95]</a>
Only the
unceasing struggle of the working class prevents the capitalists from
permanently impairing the conditions of its life and work.
Nevertheless,
comparison of the results achieved by the working class in its struggle
against
the capitalists to improve its position in bourgeois society on the one
hand
with the overall development of capitalism and the position of the
capitalist
class in bourgeois society on the other fully bears out Marx's
conclusion about
the increasing gap in the social status of workers and capitalists.</p>
<p>Marx
pointed out that the possible
improvement of the worker's living conditions changed nothing in the
fact that
as a result of growing labour productivity a still larger part of the
working
day is appropriated by capital. Hence the absurdity of wishing to
disprove this
law by means of statistical calculations proving that the worker's
material
position has improved here or there, in this relation or that, as a
result of
the development of labour productivity. <a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[96]</a>
This is how Marxist theory sees the impoverishment of working people in
bourgeois society.</p>
<p>The
position of the working class today is
characterised by the widening gap between the actual value of
labour-power and
real wages. The reason is the growth of the workers' socially necessary
requirements which is due to the intensification of labour and the
rising
material, social and cultural standards of the working class. As a
result, real
wages lag behind the growth of the value of labour-power. The position
of the
working class is also greatly affected by the ever-growing threat of
unemployment (sharply aggravated owing to the energy crisis) and actual
unemployment brought about by automation and the intensification of
labour. The
"insecurity of existence" <a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[97]</a>
mentioned by Engels keeps increasing. These objective facts
convincingly bear
out the Marxist impoverishment theory. Nothing but a social revolution
and the
conquest of political power can set the working class free.</p>
<p>The
development of modern capitalism has
also fully borne out another fundamental proposition of Marxist theory
- on the
growth of <i>proletarisation</i> in capitalist society.
Describing this
tendency, Marx noted in <i>Capital</i> that capitalist
exploitation had so far
existed in the world only as an exception. At present, however, the
overwhelming majority of the population in capitalist countries are
wage-workers, and wage-labour constitutes the basis of capitalism on a
far
larger scale than in Marx's own day. Whereas in the middle of the 19th
century
wage-workers accounted for 55-60 per cent of the gainfully employed
population
(about 82 per cent in Britain and 59.4 per cent in the United States),
in the
middle of this century wage-labour already accounted for 72-93 per cent
of the
gainfully employed population of the developed capitalist countries,
with the
exception of Japan and Italy (93.1 per cent in Britain and 88.6 per
cent in the
United States). Marx's description of capitalism has proved so
profound, the
tendencies of its development have been so clearly grasped that,
according to
Academician E.Varga, the Soviet economist, "present-day capitalism in
the
industrially developed countries much more closely resembles the
capitalist
society consisting of two classes - bourgeoisie and proletariat - that
Marx
assumed to exist as the starting point of his analysis, than it does
the
capitalism actually existing in Marx's lifetime.&#8221; <a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[98]</a></p>
<p>Marx
made it clear that he did not examine
the "actual composition" of bourgeois society which, he wrote,
"by no means consists only of two classes, workers and industrial
capitalists."
He noted "the constantly growing number of the middle classes, those
who
stand between the workman on the one hand and the capitalist and
landlord on
the other. The middle classes maintain themselves to an ever increasing
extent
directly out of revenue, they are a burden weighing heavily on the
working base
and increase the social security and power of the upper ten thousand." <a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[99]</a>
According to the Soviet scholar S.Nadel, who based himself on 1964
data, <a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[100]</a>
the
present-day class composition of US society is (in percentages of
gainfully
employed population): bourgeoisie-3 per cent, proletariat - 78 per
cent, petty
bourgeoisie-11 per cent and intermediate sections-8 per cent. As the
petty
bourgeoisie as a class consists of small property owners in towns and
villages
who live wholly or chiefly by their own work, the middle classes, those
standing between the working class and the capitalists, account, then,
for 19
per cent of the total gainfully employed population of the United
States.</p>
<p>Recent
variations in the composition of the
working class itself speak of the exceptional significance of the
category of
"total worker" introduced and examined in <i>Capital</i>.
This
category includes mental as well as manual workers directly
participating in
production and being wage-workers in relation to capital.</p>
<p>As
production becomes more and more
amalgamated under modern capitalism, the collective character of the
labour
process increases still more, going beyond the formation of the "total
worker" and taking the shape of large industrial complexes which often
include practically all workers engaged in an industry or a group of
similar
industries. Nevertheless, the current tendencies, such as the growth of
the
number of wage-workers employed outside material production proper, the
growth
of the number of office employees, the increased share of brainwork in
the
composition of the "total worker," and so on, does not mean
"deproletarianisation" of the working class. Granted, one of the
results of the scientific-technological revolution has been an increase
in the
number of white-collar workers. In highly developed capitalist
countries they
account for a quarter of the population engaged in industrial
production. But
just as much as the industrial proletariat, they have to sell their
labour-power to the capitalists, they are threatened by unemployment
owing to
increasing automation, and their salaries are often less than skilled
workers'
wages. For all these reasons they often join the workers against the
monopolies. In the course of this common struggle the social barriers
still
separating the proletarians working at a machine-tool and the
proletarians
working at a writing desk or drawing board are gradually overcome.
Certainly,
better understanding and closer contact between manual workers and
intellectuals does not yet mean that they have merged into one group,
that all
social distinctions between them have disappeared. So far these
distinctions
(e.g. , the wage and educational level, etc.) effectively offset the
factors
bringing them together. Nevertheless, the introduction of the main laws
of
capitalist material production in the field of science and culture
tends to
erode the social barrier between the working class and the
intellectuals and to
unite these social groups in the anti-imperialist struggle.</p>
<p>The
1969 International Meeting of Communist
and Workers' Parties stated: "In this age, when science is becoming a
direct productive force, growing numbers of intellectuals are swelling
the
ranks of wage and salary workers. Their social interests intertwine
with those
of the working class ... The alliance of workers by hand and by brain
is
becoming an increasingly important force in the struggle for peace,
democracy
and social progress ..." <a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[101]</a></p>
<p>Economic
development today more than ever
before calls for joint efforts by the working class on an <i>international</i>
scale as well as within separate industries and countries. From Marx's
economic
theory, as we saw, it directly follows that regardless of ruthless
competition
the capitalist class operates as a united whole in exploiting the
workers. The
famous slogan, "Working men of all lands, unite!" is therefore
founded on the objective position of the working class in the
capitalist
economic system. Today workers can only get their demands satisfied by
resorting to trade union action within an enterprise or industry. The
anti-monopoly, democratic alternative to the Common Market, to
state-monopoly
integration must of necessity be international, i.e. , it must reflect
the
interests of working people of all the countries involved in
integration. It is
plain that only international co-ordination of working-class action -
through
the trade unions, for example - can ensure success to the struggle
against
international monopoly capital.</p>
<p>Integration
and the attendant
interdependence of whole branches of production on a national and
international
scale make the situation favourable for industrial action by the
working class,
as every stoppage of production strikes at a group of monopolies. The
success of
this struggle directly depends on the proletariat's international
solidarity.
Here systematic contacts between parties of the working class have an
important
role to play. It is of utmost importance under present-day
circumstances to
subject economic processes to scientific analysis, to work out promptly
joint
methods of dealing with new forms of capitalist exploitation, and to
co-ordinate the strategy and tactics of the international workers'
movement.</p>
<p>The
political integration of the working
class of the capitalist and socialist countries is counterposed to the
process
of capitalist economic integration. The international unity of the
working
class alone can help to find solutions to cardinal problems facing
society. And
these arc vast problems indeed: the radical democratisation of economic
development of whole regions or even of the world, the solution of the
problem
of national sovereignty, made particularly acute by the process of
integration,
the problem of relaxing international tensions and promoting
co-operation
between the socialist and the capitalist countries. The widest
international
co-operation of the working class alone can ensure a united front of
peoples
working for peace and for prevention of a nuclear catastrophe.</p>
<p>The
changes that have occurred in the
social structure of bourgeois society have opened up broad prospects
for the
revolutionary struggle of the working class, for the fulfilment of its
world-historic role of leader of the socialist revolution, the leader
of all
the oppressed and exploited. A favourable situation for the promotion
of the
working class to a leading position in society and the establishment of
a firm
alliance between the proletariat and the peasant and petty bourgeois
masses is
created by the absolute and relative increase in the number of
wage-workers in
developed capitalist countries and the greater economic role of the
industrial
proletariat working in key sectors of the economy. Other factors at
work are:
the narrowing gap between the working conditions of workers and
employees in
various branches; the fact that the bulk of intellectuals are becoming
wage-workers; the continuous ousting of small urban producers from
material
production and their increasing economic instability; the growing class
stratification of farmers in the developed capitalist countries; the
more
active involvement of peasants and the semi-proletariat in the
national-liberation struggle in most of the developing countries, along
with
the weakening of the position of feudal chiefs, landowners and the
upper
bourgeoisie.</p>
<h2>3. Forecasts of a Communist
Economy</h2>
<p>Marx
showed bourgeois society in <i>Capital</i>
as a living whole, as a historically determined, transient stage in the
development of mankind. As he analysed capitalism, Marx systematically
compared
it with both pre-capitalist formations and a future communist society.
This
feature of Marx's economic theory follows directly from his method of
investigation in which, as we saw, historical and logical analysis are
combined. This method gave Marx the opportunity to explain thoroughly
the
particular characteristics of capitalist society on the one hand, and
to
explain the economic law of its movement, to justify its inevitable
replacement
by communism, on the other. Obviously, Marx did not - nor could he -
investigate
in detail in <i>Capital</i> the society of the future. In
a review of the first
volume of <i>Capital</i> Engels wrote that those who
thought they would learn
from it what the thousand-year kingdom of communism would be actually
like
would be disappointed, for Marx gave only some <i>very</i>
general hints of
what would be after the social revolution. <a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[102]</a>
But although Marx referred to a communist economy in very general
terms, he
still described its most essential features, giving a sufficiently
complete
picture of communism. In the current epoch, when the building of a new
society
has become a practical task for a third of mankind, Marx's forecast is
of
immense interest.</p>
<p>First
of all it must be stressed that
scientific forecasting presents tremendous problems. Academician N.
Belov, a
prominent Soviet physicist, justly observed that "every scientific
long-term forecast unfortunately can only be approximate and can even
be so far
off that it may be at complete variance with what will actually
happen." <a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[103]</a>
This is
how it is with the forecasting of physical phenomena. Social processes
are much
more difficult to forecast. And if we can now say that Marx's forecasts
have
proved to be highly reliable, it is thanks above all to the <i>method</i>
of
differentiating between the material content and social form of
economic
processes, which Marx applied. We dwelt on this method in the second
part of
this book. Marx's forecasts were founded each time on analysis of the
material
content of the economic system, and that gave them a completely
realistic,
scientific character.</p>
<p>On
the strength of the researches carried
out in <i>Capital</i> Marx gave in the <i>Critique
of the Gotha Programme</i>
(1875) a detailed description of the basic features of communist
society at its
is initial stage (the first or lower phase - socialism) and at the
stage of its
full development (the higher phase, communism). Marx believed that in <i>both</i>
phases of communist society "based on common ownership of the means of
production, the producers do not exchange their products; just as
little does
the labour employed on the products appear here <i>as the value</i>
of these
products, as a material quality possessed by them, since now, in
contrast to
capitalist society, individual labour no longer exists in an indirect
fashion
but directly as a component part of the total labour." <a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[104]</a>
Comparing this conclusion with the real existence of commodity-money
relations
in socialist society today, sonic researchers (Marxists and
non-Marxists, not
to mention anti-Marxists) have arrived at the conclusion that there is
an
irreconcilable contradiction between the law of value and a socialist
planned
economy. Some bourgeois economists conclude, moreover, that the future
of
socialism depends on the outcome of the struggle between the law of
value and
socialist planning. Accordingly, they interpret the socialist
countries' course
for the further improvement of planning and economic stimulation of
production,
and in particular for the development of commodity-value relations, as
a
departure from socialism. Such assertions are erroneous because they
stem from
an identification of a <i>concrete</i> socialist economy
with its <i>abstract</i>
theoretical model given in <i>Capital</i>, which implies
the creation of
"the full material conditions for the total, universal development of
the
productive forces of the individual." <a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[105]</a>
All such material conditions may be provided only in the higher phase
of
communism. As for the socialist phase, it is characterised by the
insufficient
maturity of social labour. Hence commodity production is necessary, and
the law
of value must operate in a socialist economy. The starting-points for
achieving
a correct solution of this most complex problem are contained in Marx's
economic theory. </p>
<p>Considering
in the <i>Critique of the Gotha
Programme</i> the first phase of communist society <a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[106]</a>,
Marx
proceeded from its transitional character. "What we have to deal with
here," he wrote, "is a communist society, not as it has <i>developed</i>
on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it <i>emerges</i>
from
capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically,
morally and
intellectually, still stamped with the birth marks of the old society
from
whose womb it emerges." The first consequence of the transitional
character of socialism is that in it the principle of distribution
according to
work, i.e. , in fact, the principle of equivalent exchange,
predominates.
"Accordingly," Marx continues, "the individual producer receives
back from society - after the deductions have been made - exactly what
he gives
to it." Nevertheless. Marx. calls attention to the fact that in the
first
phase of communism both the content and form of equivalent exchange
differ from
the capitalist commodity exchange. The <i>content</i>
becomes different as
"under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his
labour, and because, on the other hand, nothing can pass to the
ownership of
individuals except individual means of consumption." And the <i>form</i>
of equivalent exchange becomes different in that "... principle and
practice are no longer at loggerheads, while the exchange of
equivalents in
commodity exchange only exists <i>on the average</i> and
not in the individual
case.&#8221; The latter proposition points to the planned character of the
equivalent
exchange under socialism.</p>
<p>The
exchange of equivalents mentioned here
by Marx does not, by itself, imply the operation of the law of value,
although
it is indeed the material basis for the operation of the law. Under the
real
conditions of socialism to this material basis the social form of value
is
necessarily added. Why? The level of the productive forces and the
consequent
level of socialisation of production in the real circumstances of
socialism are
such that directly social labour (and it is directly social owing to
the
predominance of the social ownership of the means of production) is not
still
completely social. Only under developed communism (in its higher phase)
is the
social form of production fully adequate to the material content of
production.
"In a higher phase of communist society," Marx wrote, "after the
enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labour,
and
therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labour, has
vanished;
after labour has become not only a means of life but life's prime want;
after
the productive forces have also increased with the all-round
development of the
individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more
abundantly - only
then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its
entirety and
society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to
each
according to his needs!" <a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="">[107]</a>
Under socialism, however, private and social labour are not yet
completely
identical. The work done in each enterprise is relatively independent
of the
work done in other enterprises. Private labour has still to prove its
social
nature by marketing its products, by converting commodities into money.
Under
socialism (albeit on an entirely different basis, compared with
capitalism, on
the basis of social ownership) labour and the product of labour still
retain
the two-fold character, and so there remains the need to reduce
concrete labour
to abstract labour, to reduce a use-value to value, and so on.</p>
<p>Under
socialism the products of labour
have, on the one hand, the specific features of directly social planned
production which exists on the basis of social ownership; on the other
hand
they are commodities. But even to the extent that a product of labour
is a
commodity it is essentially different from the commodity as a category
of the
capitalist economic system. It is different first of all because under
socialism such category of commodity as labour-power does not exist.
The very
aim of socialist production makes it impossible for labour-power to
become a
commodity.</p>
<p>As he
analysed the dialectics of the change
of commodity production into capitalist production, Marx pointed out
that
"This result becomes inevitable from the moment there is a free sale,
by
the labourer himself, of labour-power as a commodity ..." <a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[108]</a>
Thus
the fact that under socialism labour-power does not become a commodity
not only
restrains commodity production so that it cannot "unfold all its hidden
potentialities," but radically alters the very <i>tendency</i>
of the
development of commodity production, making it possible in principle
for it to
work for the socialist economy. Socialist ownership of the means of
production
determines the planned character of production under socialism as well
as its
relatively <i>limited</i> character (compared with
capitalist production),
since labour-power here is not a commodity. As in the first phase of
communism
the level of socialisation of production is not sufficiently high, the
planning
of social production is still unable to reflect adequately the
objective
development of the productive forces and must be of necessity <i>supplemented</i>
by a system of commodity-money relations.</p>
<p>Such
are, in general outline, the
non-antagonistic contradictions between the productive forces and the
relations
of production in the economic sphere under socialism. From this we see
how
unjustifiable it is to contrast economic planning and the
commodity-money
relations. It is equally absurd to declare, as some people do, that
socialism
is merely a variant of commodity production, a "market socialism."</p>
<p>It is
not our purpose here to dwell in
detail on Marx's views on the economics of communism. All we wanted to
do was
to illustrate by a single example (which is, incidentally, of great
importance
to socialist production) that Marx's economic theory - provided, of
course, it
is approached in a truly dialectical, creative fashion --gives us the
key to
the processes going on at present.</p>
<h2>THE LAST PAGE</h2>
<p>That
is all, dear reader, that the author
set out to and that he possibly could say within the space of this
small book.
The many quotations in it show the author's desire to give the floor as
often
as possible to the central figure in the story, to Karl Marx, for the
author is
completely convinced that the best way of understanding a scientific
theory is
to go to the original source.</p>
<p>Before
parting from the reader the author
would like to draw his attention to the remarkable unity of Marx's
doctrine, to
the close cohesion of all its component parts. We have seen that the
main
propositions of the theory of scientific communism were formulated by
Marx and
Engels in the 1840s as conclusions from materialist conception of the
history
of human society. The development of this conception in turn provided
the
guidelines for Marx's economic researches, while the need for the
further
elaboration of the theory of scientific communism made these researches
vitally
necessary. Lastly, the elaboration of the economic theory substantially
enriched the materialist conception of history. This interaction
existed
throughout the theoretical investigation pursued by Marx and Engels. It
completely refutes the conjectures of the opponents of Marxism who
counterpose
to one another different aspects of Marx's doctrine, different stages
in the
development of this doctrine, and especially the doctrine itself and
its
revolutionary conclusions. Recognising Marx the scholar, bourgeois or
revisionist theorists seek, as often as not, to separate him from Marx
the
revolutionary. Nothing could he more absurd than that.</p>
<p>Long
ago, in 1845, the young Engels wrote
with great conviction: "As confidently as we can derive a new
proposition
from some given mathematical axioms, so confidently can we draw from
the
existing economic relations and the principles of political economy the
conclusion about the forthcoming social revolution." <a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[109]</a>
Marx's
enormous work on <i>Capital</i>, to which he devoted forty
years of his life,
made this bold prediction a reality. Mankind's transition to a new
historical
epoch, the epoch of the purposeful reorganisation of human society,
predicted
in Marx's theory, is under way, and nothing can stop it.</p>
