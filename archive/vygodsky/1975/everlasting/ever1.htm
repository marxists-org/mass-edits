<p>TO
THE READER</p>
<p>What
did the author of <i>Capital</i> think
of his work? Not so long ago, in 1963, an interesting letter, written
by Karl
Marx to his closest friend, Frederick Engels, was published. The letter
was
written on February 20, 1866, when Marx was finishing the first volume
of his
life's work, <i>Capital</i>. "You understand, my dear
fellow," Marx
wrote, "that in a work like mine shortcomings in details are
inevitable.
But the <i>composition</i>, the way it hangs together, is
a triumph of German
science an individual German can admit to, as the credit in no way goes
to <i>him</i>,
but rather to the nation."<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>
More than a century has passed since Marx wrote this, and today we can
state
with confidence that Marx's judgement was correct - that his brilliant
work has
stood the most crucial test, the test of time. It does not surprise us
that
outstanding works of literature and art still retain their artistic
value for
hundreds and even thousands of years. But <i>Capital</i>
is, after all,
strictly a scientific work. Still, it is not only as contemporary as
ever but
its significance and popularity continue to grow.</p>
<p>Emile
James, a well-known French economist
of virtually no Marxist leanings, wrote: "Perhaps more attention is
paid
to works by Karl Marx in our age than ever before, and not only in
Soviet
Russia but in the West as well."<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a>
&nbsp;Certainly, we can find many opponents of Marx's revolutionary
conceptions
among contemporary economists and philosophers. It is now over a
hundred years
since an uncompromising theoretical and ideological struggle has been
going on
around <i>Capital</i>. Nor can this be regarded as at all
surprising, as Marx's
ideas bear on the most vital issues concerning millions and millions of
people:
social strata, groups, classes, nations and the whole of mankind. The
new thing
about this struggle is that the more serious of the contemporary
non-Marxist
scholars do not reject Marxist theory wholesale, far from it. W.
Leontief, a
prominent American economist, writes, for instance: "The significance
of
Marx for modern economic theory is that of an inexhaustible source of
direct
observation. Much of the present-day theorising is purely derivative,
secondhand theorising ... If before attempting any explanation one
wants to
learn what profits and wages and capitalist enterprises actually are,
he can
obtain in the three volumes of <i>Capital</i> more
realistic and relevant
firsthand information than he could possibly hope to find in ten
successive
issues of the United States Census . .."<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a></p>
<p>
Why
is it that the name of Karl Marx is
familiar to every educated person and that <i>Capital</i>
has become a handbook
for millions? Why is there as much need for it today as there was a
hundred
years ago? The long life of <i>Capital</i> is, certainly,
primarily due to the
genius of its author.</p>
<p>Part
I of this book deals with Marx's
creative method, the style of his scientific work, his extraordinary
thoroughness - in a word, it tells how Marx worked on <i>Capital</i>.
The result
of his work is stupendous. Not only does <i>Capital</i>
supply answers to questions
posed by history a century ago, but it explains many problems of
concern to
mankind today. And, most important and most valuable of all, <i>Capital</i>
furnishes a method for finding solutions to these problems. Describing
Marxist
theory, Engels pointed out that Marx's " ... way of viewing things is
not
a doctrine but a method. It does not provide ready-made dogmas, but
criteria
for further research and the method for this research."<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a></p>
<p>
Part
II of this book shows that the reason
why Marx's economic theory is able to meet present-day requirements is
that it
is consistently based on the materialist dialectical method. It is the
creative
application of this method, which enabled Marx to get to the essence of
things,
disclosing the key tendencies and pointing out the driving forces of
social
development. Some latent tendencies mentioned in <i>Capital</i>
(discussed in
Part III of this book) appeared to be so underlying that they have only
recently become fully apparent.</p>
<p>Attentive
observers now note a kind of
"revival" of Marx's popularity among the younger generation in the
West. The reactionaries even reproach them for following the "Marxist
craze," as they have termed it. Young people - workers, students,
intellectuals - are trying to find in Marx's works answers to the most
vital
issues of today. However, their way of understanding <i>Capital</i>
is often
emotional rather than dialectical. And Marx's ideas often reach them in
a
rather distorted form. The aim of this book is to bring the reader
closer to
Marx, to shed some light on the actual contents of <i>Capital</i>,
to show the
significance of Marx's economic theory in present-day circumstances, to
show
that this theory can be applied and developed to explain our
contemporary
world.</p>

is a most absorbing study," said Alexander Pushkin, * the Russian poet.
