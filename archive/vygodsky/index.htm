  <p class="information">When Vitaly Solomonovich Vygodsky
graduated from high school in 1946
with a silver
medal, the teacher pointed out his obvious mathematical skills and his
future seemed to be in theoretical mathematics. But things turned out
differently. He joined the Physics Department of Moscow State
University, studied there three years, but when it came to the
practical exercises in the lab, realized that physics was not his
vocation. Subsequently, he used to joke that he had two left hands.
Officially, he interrupted his studies due to illness, but did not
return to the Physics Faculty and in 1950 joined the department of
political economy at&nbsp; MGEI (Moscow State Economics Institute).</p>


  
  <p class="information">His scientific and political
proclivities were displayed as a student. He was an active member of
the FNL faculty, student member of the editorial board of a scientific
journal and a union and Komsomol organizer. His first work was
published in the scientific notes for students at MGEI in 1955.
Vygodsky graduated with honors from the institute and successfully
passed the competitive examination to become a postgraduate external
student at the Economics Institute. Simultaneously, on the
recommendation of Professor PK Figurnov he was employed at the
Institute of Marx - Engels - Lenin - Stalin (from 1956 - the Institute
of Marxism-Leninism). It is here that Vygodsky worked for more than 35
years, having gone through all steps of career - from junior to senior
researcher to head of the group working on theoretical problems of
Marxism.</p>


  
  <p class="information">Starting work, Vitaly immediately
showed himself as a talented
Marxologist. His subsequent direction of research included the genesis
of the economic studies of Marx and the history of the creation of
Capital. The results of this was his Ph.D. and first monograph «The
place of Theories of Surplus Value in the economic legacy of Karl Marx»
(1961).</p>


  
  <p class="information">A particularly important part of
the work, to which he gave
considerable energy, was his involvement in the international group of
MEGA - the complete edition of works by Marx and Engels in their
original languages. Vitaly was a great promoter of economic theory. His
books, such as «The Story of a Great Discovery. How Karl Marx wrote "Capital"», «On the
History of the Creation of« Capital », and many others have been
translated and published in Italy, Germany, China, Mexico, Japan and
many other countries. The full bibliography of works by Vygodsky
includes over 180 titles.</p>


  
  <p class="information">In 1972 he became a Doctor of
Economic Sciences. He was awarded the
title of Honored Worker of Science. He died on 8 May 1998.</p>


  
  <p class="information">Vygodsky is of particular
significance to English-speaking students of
Marx as&nbsp; Editor of Volume 31 and Scientific Editor of Volumes
30, 32 and 34 of the English edition of Marx - Engels Collected Works. </p>
