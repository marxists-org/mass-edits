<h1>Red Banners</h1>

<p>As the Autumn down the year&#8217;s path stealing<br / >
Hangs its scarlet banners through the land, <br / >
Touching copse and moorland, ash and rowan, <br / >
With the magic of its crimson wand; <br / >
So our cause steals over hill and valley, <br / >
Wafts through hamlet glimpse of vision red; <br / >
Catches tree-tops of the great world thinkers, <br / >
Flaunts the scarlet banner overhead.</p>

<p>Banner dyed with Privilege&#8217;s life stream, <br / >
Banner stained with Feudal year's decay, <br / >
Stiff with weary workers&#8217; blood-red heart drops, <br / >
Borne aloft by staggering men at bay. <br / >
Banner carried through the mart and workshop, <br / >
Hailed by comrades as the token sure: <br / >
&#8220;From red Autumn&#8217;s reek and Winter&#8217;s death pangs<br / >
Rises Spring with hope and purpose sure!&#8221;</p>

<p>Come, then, Comrades, lend a hand to Autumn, <br / >
Hang out scarlet banners through the land; <br / >
Let each village, hamlet, cot and roadside<br / >
Feel the magic of our crimson wand; <br / >
Preach our Gospel over hill and valley; <br / >
Give our cause hot words and visions red; <br / >
Gather in the conscripts for the battle, <br / >
Flaunt the scarlet banner overhead!</p>

<p>Let us vow beneath red stains of Autumn<br / >
Never more shall child be starved or lone; <br / >
Never more shall weary man or woman<br / >
Seek for work and bread&#8212;and find a stone. <br / >
Never more shall man enslave his brother<br / >
With the gold from sweated workers got; <br / >
Never more shall wealth lie stored and useless, <br / >
While folk shiver, starve and rot.</p>

<p>&#8217;Tis the workers who must free the workers; <br / >
&#8217;Tis the toilers&#8217; blood has dyed our flag; <br / >
Come, then, comrades, lend a hand to Autumn, <br / >
Flaunt the red on moorland and on crag! <br / >
Ye are many in your sweltering slum-lands, <br / >
They are few, and in their hearts is dread; <br / >
Lo! the red pall o&#8217;er the land is spreading, <br / >
Flaunt the scarlet banner overhead!</p>
