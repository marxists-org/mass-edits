<p class="fst">You have misunderstood the last part of <a href="../03/25.htm">my letter</a>. My desire, as an Adult Suffragist, is to see Mr. Asquith pushing all the shivering folk, &#8220;Anti&#8217;s&#8221; included, into the water that they may learn to swim. Those who advocate the Limited Measure desire to see Mr. Asquith push only a few in. If I am permitted to be near at hand when the struggling, splashing democracy is spluttering for breath in the cold water, I would point out that there is a fair and green island of social revolution, much easier and safer for the swimmers than the water-logged skiff of Social Reform to which too many of them are stretching out imploring hands, and vainly trusting that it will grant them salvation.
