<p class="indentb">Oh, it&#8217;s good to be a driver in the M.T.C.,<br />
And I&#8217;m leading this old. Daimler such a dance: <br />
My home is in Australia, but I came across the sea<br />
To-bump along the cobbles of North France.</p>

<p class="indentb">Eleven weeks we wallowed, and we pitched, and then we tossed<br />
From Melbourne to the lights of Plymouth Sound; <br />
Our convoy squelched a U Boat, which will be reported &#8220;Lost,&#8221; <br />
And next day we marched with joy on English ground. </p>

<p class="indentb">Then we trained in wind and showers on those ruddy Salisbury Plains, <br />
And we went on leave, in London, for a spree; <br />
And now we&#8217;re hustling Daimlers through eternal autumn rains<br />
Learning &#8220;Parlez-vous&#8221; and &#8220;Mademoiselle, merci.&#8221; </p>

<p class="indentb">But on board ship I was reading how a hundred years ago <br />
Napoleon fought where we are fighting now; <br />
How the towns were wrecked and ruined, how tears and blood did flow, <br />
And how Flanders was the centre of the row. </p>

<p class="indentb">I read of how Nap threatened to invade old Blighty&#8217;s shore; <br />
Just the same as Kaiser William raves and prays, <br />
With his &#8220;Good old Gott&#8221;, as ally; on whom he sets great store<br />
As a helper, in these drum-fire shell-gas days. </p>

<p class="indentb">And I read of Marlborough&#8217;s victories at Malplaquet and elsewhere, <br />
And how King Hal at Agincourt won fame; <br />
And I think of all the millions whose bones lie rotting here<br />
In this cockpit a old Europe&#8217;s field of shame. </p>

<p class="indentb">And I muse of home and sunshine in our young Australia&#8217;s land, <br />
Where the People have more space and air to grow; <br />
And I wonder why we came to worry Kaiser William&#8217;s German Band, <br />
Why we joined the quarrel here from &#8220;down below.&#8221; </p>

<p class="indentb">And I think of him, my pal that was (now trodden in the mire), <br />
With shell splinters in his belly, and his face awry with pain; <br />
And I grit my teeth and curse the man as double damnedest liar<br />
Who drove us to be slayers, or be slain. </p>

<p class="indentb">For I&#8217;ve learnt that Fritz is much like us, and wants to live in peace; <br />
That his Empire is as selfish as our own, <br />
That until the People free themselves these wars will never cease, <br />
So we&#8217;ll have to spring-clean Church and State and Throne. </p>

<p class="indentb">Oh, its good to be a driver in the M.T.C., <br />
And to watch the &#8220;Subs&#8221; who give themselves away, <br />
And to teach the swine that some day their time will cease to be,- <br />
When the khaki&#8217;s off and they are, ... well, just they. </p>

<p class="indentb">So we drive along to Heaven or Hell, as the blessed Fates decree, <br />
And we lead our blamed old Daimlers such a dance, <br />
As we think of Home and kiddies whom we&#8217;ve left across the sea, <br />
While we bump along the cobbles of North France. </p>
