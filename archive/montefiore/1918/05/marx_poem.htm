<p class="indentb"><strong>In Memory of Karl Marx</strong>
</p>

<p class="indentb">Born in the hour to give the Workers light<br />
And hope upon their far-flung upward way, <br />
We greet your memory, Marx, when now the flight<br />
Of years leads us to hail with joy the day. <br />
A hundred years ago that saw your birth. <br />
The potency of Truth still wings your word, <br />
Interpreting to toilers their great worth, <br />
As those who make all wealth. And still is heard<br />
Above the crash of battle, where they fall &#8212; <br />
The wage-slaves dying in their masters&#8217; cause, <br />
Slaying and slain &#8212; your rousing clarion call: <br />
&#8220;Workers unite! Lay down your arms, and pause<br />
To think WHO IS YOUR ENEMY? Then fall<br />
Upon the foe whose galling fetter gnaws&#8221;. <br />
