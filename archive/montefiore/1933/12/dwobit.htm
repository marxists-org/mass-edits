<p class="fst">We regret to announce the death of Comrade Mrs. Dora Montefiore. She was an old Socialist and a member of the Communist Party at its formation.
</p>
<p>
Ill-health and loss of sight prevented her from taking an active part in the movement in recent years.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Montefiore was an old and close friend of Clara Zetkin.
</p>
<p>
The funeral is to take place at Golders Green to-day at 12.30 p.m.
</p>
