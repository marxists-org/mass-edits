<p class="fst">Beating, beating, beating at the Door of Privilege,<br />
Listen to the many million hands. <br />
Ever more urgent grows the sound, <br />
Ever more strong and conscious grows the pressure of those that beat with bare hands. . . . <br />
The gnarled and wounded hands of labour, <br />
The hands of homeless &#8220;heroes,&#8221; who, have returned from War to starve in Peace, <br />
The wrinkled hands of working Motherhood, <br />
The soft, compelling hands of little children…<br />
And the heavy Door of Privilege, studded with the iron bolts of ancient laws, <br />
Groans and sways under the pressure of those millions of beating hands. . . <br />
Behind the Door huddle fear-stricken the Privileged Few. <br />
Horror is in their eyes, for they have heard the tale of how one of the heaviest and most well-guarded Doors had lately given way, <br />
And how the Millions, entering in., had driven out the Few, <br />
Or had compelled them to work. . . . <br />
So, those behind the Door shrink and tremble, as they listen to the beating of the bare hands, <br />
Though some mock, and others say: &#8220;Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow the Terror may be upon us.&#8221; <br />
And as the Door sways inwards with the pressure, <br />
Those who beat upon it catch glimpses of the revels and of the luxury of the Privileged Few, whose armed mercenaries guard the inner side of the Door. <br />
And those whose hands are bruised and weary, beating on the outside, cry to the armed guards: <br />
&#8220;Brothers, you are on the wrong side of the Door; come and stand outside with us, and help us to beat down the Door of Privilege, <br />
So that we may all enter in together, and share the communal life.&#8221; <br />
And the Privileged Few inside cry out and shriek in their terror, <br />
For well they know that if their mercenaries once understand, and escape them, their last hope is gone. <br />
So they double their rewards to those who guard the great Door, and again they say: &#8220;It is well, it is well; the dogs will be forced to go back to their kennels.&#8221;… <br />
But ever more urgent grows the sound al the bare, beating hands, <br />
And ever more strong and conscious grows the pressure on the great heavy Door of Privilege; <br />
And the Door is red with the oozing blood of those who beat with bare palms.… <br />
And, the end is not yet. . . . <br />
But the pressure on the Door grows and grows, <br />
While those who are behind&#8212;the Few&#8212;fear ever more and more, because they begin now to understand<br />
That the hour when the Door <em>must</em> give way is not far off. </p>
