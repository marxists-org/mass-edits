<p class="indent">
Let us sing the song of the sickle as it flashes through the grass,<br />
For the sickle reaps the full-eared grain, that feeds each lad and lass; <br />
&#8217;Tis the peasant swings the sickle, and the warm haft in his hand<br />
Is the symbol of his labour in the barn and on the land.</p>
<p class="indent">
Let us chant the clang of the hammer, as it strikes on iron and wood, <br />
For the hammer built and fashioned that which time and tides withstood. <br />
&#8217;Tis the craftsman swings the hammer, and its haft and head are sign<br />
And symbol of his labour in the home, and ship, and mine. </p>
<p class="indent">
&#8217;Tis the sickle Trotsky reaps with when he cuts up Wrangel&#8217;s ranks, <br />
When he gathers British harvests, guns, cartridges and tanks; <br />
&#8217;Tis the Hammer Lenin well might use to crack each wooden pate<br />
That keeps the peoples sundered, and that shouts the Hymn of Hate. </p>
<p class="indent">
Let us cross these labour symbols on their banner of blood-red; <br />
Let us bear them proudly forward by our Russian comrades led. <br />
&#8217;Tis the symbol of the union of the Workers East and West, <br />
&#8217;Tis the banner Labour follows on its Communistic quest. </p>
