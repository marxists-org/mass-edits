<p class="indentb">Russia has risen! Hail the happy Day<br />
When all her workers speak through Soviet Power, <br />
When all her children feel the kindly sway<br />
Of those who in harshest, darkest hour<br />
Gather them in the school, or lead them forth to play.</p>

<p class="indentb">Russia has risen! Her Red Armies sweep<br />
North, South, West, East, to hold her frontiers clear<br />
From capitalist hordes who fain would keep<br />
Their hold upon her vastness …. Lo, they hear, <br />
These newly-freed wage slaves, their lusting, stealthy creep! </p>

<p class="indentb">Russia has risen! Proletaires dictate<br />
In factory, workshop, bank; they edit news, <br />
Administer decrees, and where, but late, <br />
Ruled chaos, now their commissars infuse<br />
The new and higher ethic of the Commune State.</p>

<p class="indentb">Russia has risen! And in every land<br />
The wage-slave rises, casts his chains aside, <br />
And stands a man! &#8212; assailed on every hand<br />
By &#8220;leaders,&#8221; traitors, dupes, and those who lied<br />
To keep him chained as masters and financiers planned.</p>

<p class="indentb">Russia has risen! When will England rise? <br />
When shall her workers speak through Soviet Power? <br />
When shall her children greet through happy eyes<br />
The symbol of the New World&#8217;s Day and Hour, <br />
The celebration of a free world-linked May Day? <br />
D.B.M.</p>
