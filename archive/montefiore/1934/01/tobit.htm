<p class="fst">Mrs. Dora Barrow Montefiore, formerly a figure in the Socialist and the woman&#8217;s suffrage movements, died at Hastings on December 21, at the age of 83.
</p>
<p>
The daughter of Mr. Francis Fuller, of Hove, she went as a young woman to Australia, and there met and married Mr. George Montefiore, and a member of the well-known family of that name who died many years ago. When, in her early married life Mrs Montefiore returned to England, she began to identify herself with the Labour movement. Eventually she joined the old Social Democratic Federation and helped to organise the workers politically on the Left wing. This work she continued for many years, speaking up and down the country and giving of her means. Early in the century she was also associated with Mrs Pankhurst and her daughters Mrs Pethick Lawrence and others, ultimately joining the militant suffragettes. She was arrested and sent to prison where she went on hunger strike and on her release wrote a book on her experiences. After the War she relinquished much of her active work, and began to suffer from a serious affliction which ultimately lost	her the sight of both eyes, and which she bore with great courage. She remained  keenly interested in a affairs and spoke from a public platform when quite blind. On her eightieth birthday her friends entertained her at dinner. Mrs. Montefiore is survived by one daughter, Mrs Broad, her son died several years ago.
