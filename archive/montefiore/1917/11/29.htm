<p class="fst">By November the Paschendaele offensive was petering out after huge casualties in appalling conditions. DBM&#8217;s son was in the Australian Expeditionary Force which was engaged there.&#8212;Transcriber</p>

<p class="indentb">Along the poplar-bordered roads of France<br />
The burdened, saddened peasants come and go. <br />
Whispering &#8220;A quand la paix ?&#8221; . . . Then with a glance<br />
Turned on a roadside crucifix, they cross themselves<br />
In simple hope and faith... They do not know<br />
The Politicians&#8217; creed &#8220;The knock-out blow.&#8221;</p>

<p class="indentb">Across the endless steppes, and rich black land<br />
The Russian moujik shades his eyes and waits<br />
The sound of peace-bells, and a young son&#8217;s hand <br />
To help once more with harvest and with plough. <br />
He knows his Czar has gone; he does not know<br />
That all the Allied Czars demand the &#8220;knock-out blow.&#8221;</p>

<p class="indentb">Bending beneath the mists of Britain&#8217;s Isle, <br />
<p class="indentb">War weary artisans and miners toil, <br />
While women tend machines, use lathe and file, <br />
And droop &#8217;neath overwork and scanty food; <br />
The workers of the British nation know<br />
THEIR Premier leads the shout, &#8220;The knock-out blow&#8221;!</p>

<p class="indentb">Stiffened in trenches, chilled by autumn blasts<br />
Italians, British, French and Belgians stand<br />
In snow and rain storms, conscripts to the last<br />
Of Commerce lords, and despots of Finance. <br />
Too well the real and awful truth THEY know; <br />
These Despots have decreed &#8220;The knock-out blow.&#8221;</p>

<p class="indentb">Tossed on the winter seas in iron keels<br />
The sailors of the Allied fleets keep watch; <br />
They note the dawns and sunsets, as each steals<br />
Across the sky-line, bringing no respite<br />
To weary vigils kept for three long years. <br />
&#8220;The knock-out blow&#8221; is what each watcher hears.</p>

<p class="indentb">For are not men and women slaves to-day, <br />
Of Politicians, War and Commerce lords, <br />
Who keep back truth, and make foul lying pay, <br />
And own both armies of the Forge and Sword? <br />
Armies that sweat and swoon, and die…. For lo<br />
Financiers need them for &#8220;The knock-out blow.&#8221; <br />

<p class="indentb">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;ENVOI.<br />
O, Peoples, staggering &#8217;neath the knotted lash<br />
Of modern wars, rise to your feet, no: soldiery now –<br />
But MEN! Arm you with knowledge, and the desperate dash<br />
Of those who freedom seek. Drive out Financiers, <br />
Politicians; lay the Exploiters low; <br />
Shout THEIR old war cry: &#8220;Give the knock-out blow&#8221;!</p>
