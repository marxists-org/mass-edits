<p>We take the following from the Melbourne &#8220;Socialist&#8221;: &#8211; </p>
<p class="indentb">&#8220;Mrs. Dora B, Montefiore, of the S.D.P. was tendered a welcome dinner by the Executive of the Socialist Party, on Monday, December 5, in the Commonwealth Hotel, About two dozen were present, including Messrs. J.P. Jones, M.L.C., G. Carter, H.H. Champion, and Tom Walsh (Executive Seamen&#8217;s Union). Mr. J. Curtin presided. Ample justice having been done to the good things provided, the &#8216;Red Flag&#8217; was sung, and then the chairman proposed &#8216;The Social Revolution and Mrs. Montefiore.&#8217; The toast was supported by Messrs. Ross, Jones and Champion, and heartily honoured to the singing of &#8216;When the Revolution Comes.&#8217; Mrs. Montefiore met with a rousing and sustained reception and in reply said she was touched at hearing &#8216;The Red Flag&#8217; once more, and heartily thanked them for their fraternal hospitality. She passed on to speak of topics of Socialist interest, and plainly delighted her audience. It was a kindly and cultured speech. The &#8216;Marseillaise&#8217; concluded the proceedings.</p>
<p class="indentb">&#8220;The Socialist Party Hall was crowded to the doors on the same evening at 8 o&#8217;clock. Mr. J. Curtin (secretary) occupied the chair, and spoke finely by way of welcome to the visiting comrade. A song was sung right ringingly, and loud applause and cheers greeted Mrs. Montefiore as she rose to speak. She had selected as her subject &#8216;The English Movement and Internationalism,&#8217; and for close on an hour and a half she held the rapt attention of her delighted and appreciative listeners. Applause was frequent, and the speaker&#8217;s points sharp and telling.</p>
<p class="indentb">&#8220;Beginning with an expression of sincere thanks, and claiming to be thoroughly &#8216;at home,&#8217; Mrs. Montefiore packed much of interest and profit into her lecture. She brought greetings from the English S.D.P., she said, and was proud to be their bearer. She saw in the Socialist Party of Victoria the inspiration of the S.D.P. The gifted and genial comrade eulogised the work in Australia of Tom Mann and H.H. Champion, and paid a feeling tribute to H.M. Hyndman as English populariser of Marx and one who had left behind honours and rewards to identify himself with Socialism. She spoke admiringly of &#8216;Bill&#8217; Haywood, told of her trip to Finland, and of her visits to International Socialist Congresses and of the great Women&#8217;s Congress. She had something to say of principles and tactics, and of &#8216;the Milwaukee idea,&#8217; and so on, and said she had come to Australia to study our schools, our Socialist organisations, our women&#8217;s work, and what the Labour Party could do and could not do. In commending the &#8216;Socialist,&#8217; she mentioned with pride she had read Jessie Miller&#8217;s recent great article, and also W.T. Mills&#8217;s contributions. </p>
<p class="indentb">&#8220;The speech was a stimulating and memorable one, and it brought forth an excellent discussion. After the meeting Mrs. Montefiore fraternised with the comrades, and then said &#8216;Good-bye,&#8217; the Melbournians hoping she would come back to them.&#8221;</p>
