1898.<BR>Translated for the <B>Daily People</B> from the German by

<HR>
<P>Ladies and Gentlemen:</P>
<P>A large portion of the German capitalist class has not yet
forgotten the anti-Socialist law. They grieved greatly when the law
was revoked, and they are still fishing desperately for an
opportunity to replace it by a new exceptional law, or to render the
Common Law more rigorous. Their main support in this endeavor was
Prince Bismarck. Differences of opinion as to the manner in which the
Social Democracy should be treated led to his resignation. As he
never forgot that fact, he faithfully preserved, to the end of his
life, his old hatred for the Social Democracy.</P>
<P>Bismarck caused it repeatedly to be stated in his personal organ,
the <B>Hamburger Nachrichten</B>, that there is nothing left to be
done but to provoke the Social Democrats to commit acts of despair,
to draw them out into the open street, and there to shoot them down.
(<I>Shame! Shame!</I>) Please, no indignation. Let us rather rejoice
at the brutal frankness of our enemies.</P>
<P>The summer of 1894 arrived with the assassination of President
Carnot, of France, by Caserio, in Lyon. One is justified in asking,
Is it any of Germany&rsquo;s business if somebody is assassinated in
a neighboring country? No German statesmen were either directly or
indirectly concerned in the affair. Nobody from any quarter whatever
had even attempted to insinuate as much. And still, the fact that a
foreign Anarchist in a foreign country committed the deed sufficed to
set the German capitalists in motion against the small handful of
German Anarchists &ndash; but still more against the so-much-hated
Social Democracy.</P>
<P>At that hour a Prince in southwestern Germany dropped the remark
that the time had come to give the signal for a general campaign
against the Social Democracy; and in September of the same year, at a
convention of the National Liberals, held in Prankfurt-on-the-Main,
it was decided at a secret session to request the Government to take
action against the Social Democracy, if not with a new anti-Socialist
law, at least by rendering the Common Law more rigorous. And it was
done even so.</P>
<P>The downfall of Caprivi, Bismarck&rsquo;s successor as Chancellor
of Germany, was undoubtedly largely brought about by his belief that
any kind of a law against the Social Democracy would do more harm
than good. He then held an opinion which in 1890 was shared by the
Kaiser. But this opinion no longer prevailed in the highest circles
of Government. When Count Caprivi fell, Prince Hohenlohe appeared
before the Eeichstag with the so-called Anti-Bevolution bill
(<I>Umsturzvorlage</I>).</P>
<P>In the plenary sessions of the Reichstag, as well as in the
sessions of the committee, we did all we could to prevent the
adoption of that bill. But the Center, the Catholic clerical party of
Germany, was fired with the wish of taking advantage of the law as it
then existed, especially if made more rigorous, in order to smite the
so-called Spiritual Fathers of the Revolution &ndash; the liberal
professors with their wicked, semi-atheistic views. The
ultramontanes, in conjunction, with the conservatives, succeeded in
forcing the slightly amended demands of the Government through the
committee, but their attempt to go further by incorporating
additional clauses in the anti-Revolution bill, by means of which
they hoped to be able to &ldquo;get at&rdquo; Science itself, finally
brought on the shipwreck of the bill. In the face of the stormy
opposition from the entire world of science and art &ndash; an
opposition that was supported by the liberal element of the
capitalist class itself &ndash; the Government was finally compelled
to withdraw its bill.</P>
<P>But the purpose and thought of stabbing the Social Democracy to
the heart remained. When, in September of this year, 1898, Empress
Elizabeth of Austria was stabbed to death at Geneva, Switzerland, our
enemies again believed the day had come. A few days after the murder,
which naturally caused the indignation of the entire civilized world,
our greatest manufacturers sent to the Kaiser that now well-known
telegram, which was to inspire new exceptional measures. The telegram
read:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The terrible deed, which caused the death of Her Majesty
the Empress of Austria, is a new horrifying evidence of the aims of
Anarchism and of the tendencies that lead to Anarchism. Under the
impression of this deed, which shocks so deeply our hearts, we know
that we are as one with Your Majesty in the consciousness of the duty
to oppose with all the means of most severe legislation, the attempts
to destroy our religion, our love for our exalted Ruling House and
for the Fatherland. We, the undersigned representatives of German
industry, therefore take the liberty to offer to Your Majesty, with
our profoundest respect, the assurance that we stand faithfully by
Your Majesty in the struggle against the impious enemies of our state
and moral institutions. In our unshakable confidence in the power and
wisdom of Your Majesty we shall advance and support with utmost
energy all those measures j which Your Majesty shall deem good for
the suppression of the criminal aims of a conscienceless fanaticism
and for the maintenance of the threatened authority of the state.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With profoundest respect we remain,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CENTRAL FEDERATION OF GERMAN MANUFACTURERS;<BR>ASSOCIATION
OF GERMAN OWNERS OF IRON-WORKS;<BR>MINE-OWNERS&rsquo; ASSOCIATION OF
THE UPPER MINING DISTRICTS OF DORTMUND;<BR>ASSOCIATION FOR THE
ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF RHEINLAND AND WESTFALIA.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By order:<BR>VON HASSLER. SERVAES. LUEG. JENCKE.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thus this telegram was signed by four representatives of the upper
capitalist class of Germany, as typical as they can be picked
together in the German Empire, and who are at the head of all
measures directed against the working class.</P>
<P>The gentlemen talk in the telegram about the &ldquo;protection of
our religion.&rdquo; That makes us only smile. What is, then, the
religion of those gentlemen? I don&rsquo;t think I am much mistaken
when I say: &ldquo;The gentlemen have no more faith than I have; that
is none at all!&rdquo; <I>(Lively approval</I>) &ldquo;Religion must
be preserved for the people,&rdquo; was once said, years ago, by a
very high personage. But the gentlemen do not consider themselves
belonging to the people. (<I>Lively approval</I>) Religion is for
them only the string by means of which the masses are to be held in
contentedness, subjection, and dependence, during their sojourn in
this vale of sorrows. (<I>Laughter</I>)</P>
<P>The telegram speaks also of the &ldquo;love for our exalted Ruling
House.&rdquo; This passage puts me in mind of an article published in
1892 or 1893 in the <B>Koelnische Zeitung</B>, the paper from which
those gentlemen get their daily supply of political wisdom. At that
time the Prussian Diet was considering the property-tax bill. When
Herr Miquel, the Secretary of the Treasury, reformed the direct taxes
in a sensible way, he realized that a sharp declaration of property
was necessary to prevent the capitalists from cheating the Government
Treasury too much. Therefore, when the income-tax bill was adopted it
was followed by the proposition of a so-called supplementary tax law,
that is, by a moderate property-tax bill with compulsory declaration
of property. That bill does not by any means tax the capitalists
severely: the property tax, compared with the one existing in some
cantons of Switzerland, is exceedingly low. But this bill was
sufficient to induce the <B>Koelnische Zeitung</B> to strike an
attitude of most determined opposition. &ldquo;When such tax bills
get into the Prussian Diet,&rdquo; said that paper, &ldquo;one is
compelled to subject one&rsquo;s own monarchistic faith to closest
scrutiny.&rdquo; (<I>Laughter</I>) The gentlemen discovered then that
they eventually could also be republicans. (<I>Laughter</I>) They are
only <I>monarchists for a purpose</I>, that is, monarchistic only
because this form of government, for the time being, happens to suit
their interests in the best way.</P>
<P>Such was at that time the love of the Rheinish-Westphalian
capitalists for our &ldquo;exalted Ruling House.&rdquo;</P>
<P>And how is it with the fatherland that these gentlemen are talking
about? Was it not Herr von Hassler, who stands at the head of the
German textile industry, who declared himself in 1871 against the
annexation of Alsace-Lorrain, the same as the Social Democracy did,
only for entirely different reasons, namely, because he feared the
competition of the textile industry of Alsace? And, as is well known,
every Socialist and democrat who was opposed to the annexation, was
then considered a traitor to the fatherland. Still Herr von Hassler
and the German manufacturers in the textile industry were opposed to
it. Thus their love for the fatherland rests in their pocketbook.
(<I>Laughter</I>) All these beautiful assurances are only hollow
phrases; they are only intended to influence public opinion in order
to politically gag and handcuff the working class&rsquo; of Germany,
and prevent them also from carrying their economic conflicts with the
manufacturers to a successful issue. (<I>Loud applause</I>) This is
the secret behind that telegram.</P>
<P>Just so they proceeded in 1878, when the attempts of the idiot
Hoedel and of the degenerate Nobiling to shoot Kaiser Wilhelm I were
charged to us. Then, too, they wanted to paralyze the working people
in order to be able to carry through with all the greater ease that
great robber expedition against the working classes &ndash; the new
protective policy. The paper of the Court Pastor, A.D. Stoecker
(<I>laughter</I>), was therefore quite right when it said of that
telegram of the great manufacturers that the gentlemen who sent such
a telegram were only prompted by their own selfishness.</P>
<P>Further, the gentlemen are endeavoring to make the Anarchists and
Social Democrats appear as one. Without desiring to go to-day into a
theoretical analysis of the differences between the Social Democracy
and Anarchism, I will eay that the fact alone, that in every
civilized country the representatives of both movements are found
engaged in a most bitter conflict with each other, should suffice to
prove to every honestly thinking man that the Social-Democracy has
nothing in common with the Anarchists and vice versa. As the
Anarchists look to Proudhon, Max Stirner, Bakunin, etc., as their
spiritual fathers, so do we to Marx, Engels and Lassalle, who always
stood in sharp opposition to the former. One can hardly find two men
more opposed to each other in all their views than Bakunin &ndash;
one may say the father of the &ldquo;Propaganda of Deed&rdquo; &ndash;
and Karl Marx, the enemy of every policy of conspiracy and
assassination. Bakunin, the representative of the most extreme
individualism, the man who thought his social ideal could be realized
by means of riots and acts of violence committed against individuals
in power, and, on the other hand, Karl Marx and Engels, the founders
of the materialist conception of history, according to which the
power of single individuals, for good or for evil, is a limited one
and can only be used by them in a certain manner so long as they act
as representatives of certain class interests.</P>
<P>The Anarchists are the consistent, only extreme, branches of the
<I>capitalist liberals</I> (&ldquo;<I>Quite true!&rdquo;</I>) with
whose philosophy they have much in common, while the Social
Democracy, in accordance with the Marxian doctrine of the class
struggle, is the political representative of the proletariat which,
in the measure as it becomes class-conscious, organizes itself in the
folds of the Social Democracy in order to conquer political power and
with its help to establish a new social order, on the basis of
complete equal rights and equal obligations of all.</P>
<P>The principle that even the most powerful person can only act as
the representative of class interests, can, in an especially clear
manner, be demonstrated in the person of Bismarck. There is no other
person whom the Social Democracy had so much reason to hate, as him,
and the Social Democracy was not more hated by anybody than by just
that Bismarck. Our love and our hatred were, as you see, mutual.
(<I>Laughter</I>) But one would search in vain the entire Social
Democratic press and literature for an expression of the thought that
it would be a lucky thing if that man were removed. We shall never
have such a thought in similar cases. But how often did the
capitalist press express the idea that, were it not for Bismarck, we
would not, to this day, have a united Germany? There cannot be a more
mischievous notion than this. The unity of Germany would have come
without Bismarck as well. The idea of unity and liberty was in the
sixties so powerful among all the German people that it would have
been realized, whether with the assistance of the Hohenzollerns or
against their will. The unity of Germany was not only a political but
an <I>economic necessity</I>, primarily in the interests of the
capitalist class and its development. The idea of unity would have
ultimately broken through with elementary force. At this juncture
Bismarck made use of the tendency, <I>in his own fashion, in the
interest of the Hohenzollern dynasty</I>, and at the same time <I>in
the interest of the capitalist class and of the Yunkers</I>, the
landed nobility. The offspring of this compromise is the Constitution
of the German Empire, the provisions of which strive to reconcile the
interests of these three factors. Finally even a man like Bismarck
had to leave his post. &ldquo;What a misfortune for Germany !&rdquo;
cried the press devoted to him. Well, what did happen to Germany
since then? (<I>Laughter</I>) Even Bismarck himself could not have
ruled it much differently than it was ruled since his days.</P>
<P>The basic conception of the comparatively insignificant part
played in history by the individual distinguishes us from the
Anarchists. Anarchism is, as I said, individualism developed tc an
extreme. Nobody showed that clearer than Stirner in his book <B>The
Individual and His Property</B>. But this doctrine of the importance
of the individual &ndash; developed to its extreme consequences &ndash;
explains how people who have no capacity for keen thinking, who are
easily led by passionate impulses, or are easily influenced by
suspicious outside suggestions and whisperings, attack bodily single
individuals occupying influential positions, because they hold such
individuals responsible for the evils of society.</P>
<P>Only thus is the thought possible. &ldquo;If we succeed in
removing an influential individual, then a great, heroic deed is
committed for the emancipation of mankind.&rdquo; And with this in
the minds of morbid natures is associated the idea: &ldquo;It does
not matter who is hit so long as the victim belongs to the highest
spheres.&rdquo;</P>
<P>If this distorted, insane thought did not inspire Luccheni, the
man who stabbed in Geneva Empress Elizabeth of Austria, how could he
have murdered in cold blood a woman who never played a part in
political life; who, contrary to many other royal women, made no
claim to political influence; whom nobody could help respecting,
because she stood intellectually so much higher than most of the
royal women and admired a poet Heine as only a Social Democrat can
admire him? (<I>Applause</I>)</P>
<P>But it would be highly unfair if one wanted to hold all Anarchists
responsible for such a deed. The Anarchist papers sneer at us,
claiming that we see the hand of the police in every attempted or
executed assassination. For example, their organ, the <B>Socialist</B>,
which brands us in the bargain as reactionists, writes:</P>
<p class="quoteb">In any case it is well that it is we, Anarchists, who
first of all take the standpoint of critics regarding the
assassinations or plans of assassinations, that the future may have
in store for humanity. There is one thing that distinguishes us from
the reactionists as well as from the Social Democrats &ndash; even if
we were not to consider the latter class as reactionists; we do not
judge of things from standpoints dictated by political
considerations, &ndash; on the contrary, we seek only one thing, the
truth.</p>
<P>I am not much worried about that paper&rsquo;s characterizing us
as reactionists. Herr von Puttkamer, former Minister of the Interior
in Germany, notorious for his agent provocateur policy against the
Socialists, also characterized us as &ldquo;revolutionists in
nightgown and slippers&rdquo; and claimed: &ldquo;I like Johann Most
much better than you fellows!&rdquo; (<I>Laughter</I>) I readily
believe that, should we have done what Most, himself in a safe port,
advised to do, Bismarck and Puttkamer would have been tickled to
death. (<I>Applause</I>)</P>
<P>The reference in the <B>Socialist</B> to the assassination
committed by Luccheni is a very clumsy one. Should it ever happen,
that a bill for a new exceptional law will be introduced in the
Reichstag, I bet one thousand to one that those statements made by
the <B>Socialist</B> will be found in the preamble to that bill! I
can tell you, my Anarchist gentlemen, clumsier than you do, one
cannot put his foot into it! How can you supply the enemies with such
weapons! You must still be quite inexperienced! You will say : &ldquo;We
did not say there anything out of the way.&rdquo; But people read
between the lines, too. In the <B>Neues Leben</B> &ndash; another
Anarchist organ that I am entirely unacquainted with &ndash; the
assertion is made that the attempted assassinations at Mederwald were
arranged by Anarchists, and at the same time it is understood that it
is out of sheer cowardice that the Social Democracy denies its
identity with Anarchism. That statement was in my opinion made for a
deliberate purpose. If the author of that article had his quarters in
the great red building on Alexander Place, he could not have written
it more suitably for his purposes! (<I>Lively approval</I>)</P>
<P>In view of these facts a neat discussion between us and the
Anarchists is timely; but it would be wrong to conclude from such
clumsy utterances in the Anarchist press, that the Anarchists in
Germany are prepared to commit assassinations.</P>
<P>In what do our German Anarchists see at present their main task?
To organize the workers into unions and to set up consumers&rsquo;
leagues, to which they ascribe considerable influence on the social
life. True, I don&rsquo;t believe that. May the unions be ever so
necessary and useful, we agree in one thing &ndash; they alone will
not do. And still less will the consumers&rsquo; leagues do, which
also have a certain usefulness, provided they are well conducted. I
am not opposed to the organization of such leagues, but I also do not
spend my time setting them up. Thirty-five years ago I established a
consumers&rsquo; league, but since then I promised to myself not to
do it again. (<I>Laughter</I>) However, there is no reason to oppose
consumers&rsquo; leagues as such; many Social Democrats, especially
in Saxony, belong to them, even if these leagues are no panacea for
all ills. But to claim of men, who want to set up unions and
consumers&rsquo; leagues, that they practice assassinations is a
shameless slander! (<I>Laughter and applause</I>)</P>
<P>We stand by the law of evolution. However natural the desire of
the masses of the working people to free themselves to-day, rather
than to-morrow, from social misery and economic and political
oppression, we know it will not sooner be possible for us to reach
our aim than when the general development, which we strive to
accelerate by organizing the working class for the struggle, will
have advanced to the point when we will be strong enough to transform
society. From this standpoint we can and will consider as <I>enemies</I>
and <I>fight with determination</I> all persons in power, who oppose
us, but we will never imagine that by removing such persons by means
of violence we gain any special advantage. Bather on the contrary
reaction&rsquo;s sails are furnished with wind. (<I>Quite true</I>)
We see that to be the result of attempted or executed assassinations
in Italy, France, Belgium, Russia, and, last but not least, Germany.</P>
<P>On the other hand our capitalist enemies have the least right to
be indignant over the Anarchists. The belief in the supreme influence
of important personages in influential positions on the course of
history is of an entirely capitalistic, bourgeois, origin. (<I>Quite
true</I>) No other class in history, from the days of the ancient
Greeks down to our own age, believed, as much as that very bourgeois
class, that, to remove the person of an individual in power, means to
commit a great historic act.</P>
<P>Harmodios and Aristogeiton, who murdered the tyrant Hipparchos 514
years before Christ are even up to the present time glorified in
colleges as heroes and deliverers of the people. I shall further
remind you of Mariana, the Jesuit, who since became famous &ndash; he
taught under what circumstances each individual had a right to take
the life of a tyrant, as he called the Prince who ruled with absolute
arbitrary power. His work called <B>De rege et regis institutione</B>
in which he defended those views, was burned in 1609 in accordance
with a verdict of a Spanish court. That Jesuit saw a tyrant in every
ruler who persecuted the Catholic Church and her servants.</P>
<P>And Schiller, how does he glorify the deed of William Tell? And
what was that Tell, that Tell of fiction? A cold-blooded murderer who
from a safe ambush shot the unsuspecting Gessler, in whom he saw the
enemy of his people and the cause of their oppression. Gessler was a
tyrant the same as in the eyes of our bourgeois of the time before
the revolutionary days of March, 1848, all autocratic rulers were
tyrants.</P>
<P>Then I wish to remind you of that poem of Schiller&rsquo;s <I>Die
Buergschaft</I>, which begins with the lines:</P>
<p class="quoteb">To Dionysios, the tyrant, crept<BR>Damon, a dagger in his
cloak ...</p>
<P>Not only does not a word in this poem show that Schiller condemns
Damon for his contemplated act, on the contrary, he glorifies him for
his heroism and the noble motives of his act.</P>
<P>I have prepared a list of attempted or executed assassinations
which occurred within the last centuries. The list is by no means
complete; still I was astonished at the great number of
assassinations that took place, especially during the 19th century.</P>
<P>Among others, attempts were made on the life of Henry III of
France by a monk of the Dominican order in 1589; of Henry the IV of
France by the teacher Ravaillac in 1610; Charles I of England was
executed by order of the Long Parliament under Cromwell in 1649; Pope
Clement XIV, it is alleged, was poisoned in 1773 by the Jesuits,
whose society he dissolved; Damien made an attempt to assassinate
Louis XV of France in 1757; in 1792 Gustav III of Sweden was
assassinated by Count Ankarstrom; Paul I of Russia was assassinated
in 1801 by a conspiracy of noblemen, headed by a Count Palen and a
Herr von Bennigsen (<I>laughter</I>); attempts were made on the life
of Napoleon I by means of an infernal machine, when he was still
Consul in 1800, and by the German Stapss in 1809; in 1819 Kotzebue,
the Eussian spy, was assassinated at Mannheim by Ludwig Sand, a
student of theology.</P>
<P>In this connection it is quite interesting to observe that
<I>approval</I> in wide circles of German students and citizens, the
assassination of Kotzebue by Sand was received with. Even more. A
<I>doctor of theology</I>, Professor de Wette of the University of
Berlin, even considered it as his duty to write to the bereaved
mother of Sand a letter of consolation, in which, among other things,
he says:</P>
<P>The fact that the general public will pronounce your son a
criminal and will appear justified in doing so, compels me, after I
formed an opinion of my own about the matter, to appear as his
defender before you and to protect his memory from dishonor at least
in the midst of his family.</P>
<P>The King was informed that de Wette wrote that letter and he
thereupon was dismissed as professor. He left Berlin after having
written a letter to the King, wherein he said that he was in poor
health, without means, having to care for his wife and two children
who needed bringing up, but he would carry his cross with pride.
Later de Wette secured a position as professor in Basel, Switzerland.</P>
<P>Further assassinations or attempts at such were made on the Duke
of Berry by Lavel in 1820; on Louis Philip of France, seven attempts,
among them that of Fieschi in 1835, which caused the death of
fourteen persons, among them Marshall Mortier; attempts on Friedrich
Wilhelm IV by Mayor Tschech in 1845 and by the fireworker Sefeloge in
1850; attempts on Franz Joseph of Austria in 1849 and 1853; on
Minister Count Rossi in Rome in 1848; on Duke Karl of Parma in 1854;
an attempt on Ferdinand III of Naples in 1856; on Napoleon III, three
attempts; two in 1855 and the attempt by Orsini in 1858, which caused
the death or injuries of 137 persons.</P>
<P>Then on Wilhelm I attempts by Becker at Baden-Baden in 1861 and by
Hoedel in 1878 and Nobiling in same year; on Abraham Lincoln,
President of the United States, by the actor Booth in 1865; on
General Prim in 1870; on Prince Bismarck attempts by Cohen-Blind in
1866 and by Kullman in 1874; on Alexander II of Russia, five
attempts, a fatal attempt in 1881; on Lord Cavendish, Viceroy of
Ireland, and under-Secretary of State Burke, by the Fenians in
Phoenix Park at Dublin in 1882 ; an attempt on Queen Isabella of
Spain by a priest in 1856; four attempts on Victoria, Queen of Great
Britain, in 1840, 1842, 1872 and 1882; and in this connection it is
necessary to observe that none of these attempts was used as a
pretext for exceptional measures or for the rendering of the common
law more rigorous.</P>
<P>Then there was an attempt on Prince Michael III of Servia in 1868;
on King Humbert of Italy by Passanante in 1878; on President Garfield
of the United States in 1881; on (Jrispi in 1889; the assassination
of Bulgarian Minister Beltscheff, who was taken for Stambulow, in
1891; the assassination of Stambulow by agents of the Eussian
Government in 1895; Carnot, President of the French Republic,
assassinated by Caserio in 1894; attempt on Canovas, Spanish Prime
Minister, in 1897; on the King of Greece in 1897; assassination of
the Empress of Austria by Luccheni in 1898.</P>
<P>I shall only remind you in general of the many attempts and
assassinations committed during the last twenty years against the
highest government officials in Russia alone, as well as of the
assassinations of rulers and officials committed in Turkey and
Persia, and finally of the many political murders committed in the
South American States.</P>
<P>Characteristic is the opinion that prevailed among certain
elements of our citizens regarding the attempt made by Cohen-Blind on
the life of Bismarck in 1866. Thus Mr. Hopf, member of the local
Parliament of Wuerttemberg and later of the Reichstag wrote in the
<B>Gradaus</B>: &ldquo;So long as Germany counts such youths (as
Cohen-Blind) among her sons, she is not poor.&rdquo; Marie Kurz in a
poem glorified Cohen-Blind for his act. A comic paper in Muenchen
published a cartoon presenting the devil in the act of striking the
arm of Cohen-Blind, thus directing his revolver away from Bismarck,
and exclaiming: &ldquo;Hold on! This fellow (Bismarck) belongs to
me!&rdquo; (<I>Laughter</I>)</P>
<P>On December 8, 1856, a soldier, Agesilao Milano, made the above
referred-to attempt on the life of Ferdinand II of Naples, nicknamed
King Bomba for his bombardment of the city of Naples. The assassin
was tried by court-martial and shot. But when in 1860 Garibaldi,
supported by Victor Emanuel, drove the Bourbons from Naples, he
issued a decree which secured for the mother of the assassin, &ldquo;in
honor of the sacred memory&rdquo; of the deceased, a pension of 30
ducats a month and for each of his sisters a dowry of 2,000 ducats.
This decree was faithfully and honorably carried out by the monarch
of Italy. And these monarchs, who at that time endowed the relatives
of a cold-blooded murderer, dare now to call an anti-Anarchist
conference! (<I>Commotion</I>)</P>
<P>No class, no layer of society can be acquitted of the charge of
having furnished its quota of assassins. But for the development of
conditions all assassinations were entirely useless. The process of
evolution continued on its way without being in any way influenced by
them.</P>
<P>What good did the wholesale assassinations, the murders of tyrants
do the French Republic? Louis XVI was indeed a very harmless little
man, and still lie, and with him Queen Marie Antoinette, accused of
being tyrants, had to lay their heads under the knife of the
guillotine, and hundreds of noblemen and priests followed them to the
scaffold. But all these executions and massacres could not prevent
the monarchy from being later re-established, nor the clergy from
acquiring practically more power than before. But one thing the
later-returned Bourbons could not change any more, although the
bayonets of all Europe were supporting them &ndash; the
reconstruction of the social order accomplished by the French
Revolution, partly by the distribution among millions of the small
peasantry of the estates of the clergy and noblemen, who ran away
abroad, partly by the splendid modern capitalist legislation, which
became the model for all progressive states on the European
continent. This caused the total shipwreck of feudalism. Thirteen
years after the Bourbons had returned, they had to get out of France
again, to return nevermore.</P>
<P>Change the social order from foundation up, give it a
corresponding political superstructure and you can leave the enemies
with their heads in peace. (<I>Very good</I>)</P>
<P>It cannot be denied that there are Anarchists who committed
assassinations. For instance the assassination of President Carnot,
committed by Caserio, was a sincere anarchistic assassination. The
same must be said about the assassination committed by Luccheni. But
that does not bar the fact that men stood behind Luccheni, who took
advantage of his weak mind and induced him to commit that deed.</P>
<P>Reinsdorf, who on the occasion of the dedication of the monument
at Niederwald wanted to blow up the German rulers assembled there,
was also a sincere anarchist. But that did not prevent the secret
agent of police, Weber Palm, from getting right into the thick of the
conspiracy and being present when all the preparations were being
made. I wish to add in this connection that in this case they wanted
to cause the explosion with dynamite which they themselves had
prepared, which they therefore had previously tested in Elberfeld,
where they tried to blow up a restaurant, but failed, because the
dynamite was no good. (<I>Laughter</I>) Fortunately at Niederwald the
rain, too, came just in time and put out the fuse.</P>
<P>Let us stop now and consider how many secret police agents helped
along in the attempted or executed assassinations of the last
decades.</P>
<P>When Bismarck was Federal Ambassador at Frankfort-on-the-Main he
wrote to his wife: &ldquo;For lack of material the police agents lie
and exaggerate in a most shameful manner.&rdquo; These agents are
engaged to discover contemplated assassinations. Under these
circumstances the bad fellows among them &ndash; and no decent man
would accept a job like that (<I>Laughter</I>) &ndash; come easily to
the idea: &ldquo;If other people don&rsquo;t commit assassinations,
then, we ourselves must help the thing along.&rdquo; For, if they
cannot report that there is something doing, they will be considered
superfluous and, of course, they don&rsquo;t want that to happen. So
they &ldquo;help the thing along&rdquo; by &ldquo;correcting luck&rdquo;
as the French proverb puts it. (<I>Laughter</I>) Or they play
politics on their own score.</P>
<P>To demonstrate this I need only to remind you of the
&rsquo;&rsquo;reminiscences&rdquo; of Andrieux, the former Chief of
Police of Paris, in which he brags with the greatest cynicism of how
he, by aid of police funds, subsidized extreme Anarchist papers and
organized Anarchist assassinations, just to give a thorough scare to
rich citizens. And then there is that notorious Police Inspector
Melville of London, who also operated on these lines. That was
revealed by the investigation of the so-called Walsall assassination.
Among the assassinations committed by the Fenians there were also
some that were the work of the police, as was shown on the Parnell
trial.</P>
<P>Everybody remembers how much of such activity was displayed in
Belgium by that prince of scoundrels, Pourbaix. Even the Minister
Bernaard himself was compelled to admit before the Parliament that
Pourbaix was paid to arrange assassinations in order to justify
violent persecutions of the <I>Social Democracy</I>.</P>
<P>Likewise was Baron von Ungern-Sternberg, nicknamed the
&ldquo;bomb-baron,&rdquo; unmasked as a police agent at the Luttich
trial of Anarchists.</P>
<P>And then &ndash; our own good friends of the times of the
anti-Socialist law. (<I>Laughter</I>) About them I myself could tell
you some interesting stories, for I was among those who helped to
unmask them.</P>
<P>There is Schroeder-Brennwald, of Zurich, the chap who was
receiving from Molkenmarkt, through police counsellor Krueger, a
monthly salary of at first 200 and then 250 marks. At every meeting
in Zurich this Schroeder was stirring up people and putting them up
to commit acts of violence. But to guard against expulsion from
Switzerland by the authorities of that country he first acquired
<I>citizenship in Switzerland</I>, presumably by means of funds [1]
furnished by the police headquarters of Prussia. (<I>Laughter</I>)
Maybe he saved up that money. (<I>Laughter</I>)</P>
<P>During the summer of 1883 Schroeder and the police-Anarchist
Kaufmann called and held in Zurich a conference participated in by
thirteen persons. Schroeder acted as chairman. At that conference
plans were laid for the assassinations which were later committed in
Vienna, Stuttgart and Strassburg by Stellmacher, Kammerer and
Kumitzsch. (<I>Commotion</I>) I am not informed that these
unscrupulous scoundrels had informed the police that those murders
were being contemplated. Men like Stellmacher and Kammerer paid for
their acts with their lives, on the gallows.</P>
<P>When Johann Most was serving a term in a prison in England, this
same police spy Schroeder had Most&rsquo;s <B>Freiheit</B>&rdquo;
published at Schaffhausen, Switzerland, at his own expense. The money
surely did not come out of his own pocket. (<I>Laughter</I>)</P>
<P>That was a glorious time when our comrades unmasked this Schroeder
and the other police organizer of plots, Haupt [2], to whom the
police councillor Krueger wrote that he knew that the next attempt on
the life of the Czar of Eussia would be arranged in Geneva, and he
should send in reports. Was this demand not remarkable in the highest
degree? (<I>Laughter</I>)</P>
<P>And now Herr von Ehrenberg, the former colonel of artillery of
Baden! This fellow was unquestionably for good reason suspected of
having betrayed to the General Staff of Italy the fortifications of
Switzerland at St. Gotthard. When his residence was searched it was
brought to light that Herr von Ehrenberg worked also in the employ of
the Prussian police. He prepared regularly written reports of
conversations which he claimed to have had with our comrades, among
them also with me. Only in those alleged conversations the characters
were reversed. We were presented as advocating the most reckless
criminal plans, which in reality he himself suggested and defended,
while he pictured himself in those reports as opposing the plans.
What would have happened if some day those reports had fallen into
the hands of certain persons, and if accused, we had no witnesses to
prove the spy committed perfidy? Thus, for instance, he attempted to
convince me &ndash; but in his records claimed that it was I who
proposed it &ndash; that it would be but child&rsquo;s play to find
out the residences of the higher military officers in all the greater
cities of Germany, inen, in one night, send out our best men and have
all those officers murdered simultaneously. (<I>Commotion</I>) In
four articles published in the <B>Arbeiterstimme</B>, of Zurich, he
explained in a truly classical manner how to conduct a modern street
battle, what to do to get the best of artillery and cavalry. At
meetings he urged the collection of funds to buy arms for our people.
As soon as war broke out with France our comrades, according to him,
should break into Baden and Wuerttemberg from Switzerland, should
there tear up the tracks and confiscate the contents of the postal
and railroad treasuries. And this man, who urged us to do all that,
was, as I said, in the employ of the Prussian police. (<I>Hear!
Hear!</I>)</P>
<P>Another police preacher and organizer of violent plots was that
well-known Friedeman, who was driven out of Berlin and at the
gatherings of comrades in Zurich appealed to them, in prose and
poetry, to commit acts of violence.</P>
<P>A certain Weiss, a journeyman tinsmith, was arrested in the
vicinity of Basel for having put up posters in which the deeds of
Kammerer and Stellmacher were glorified. He, too, was in the employ
of the German police, as was established during the court
proceedings.</P>
<P>A certain Schmidt, who had to disappear from Dresden on account of
his crooked conduct, came to Zurich and urged the establishment of a
<I>special fund for assassinations</I>, contributing twenty francs to
start the fund. He also was a police agent. (<I>Laughter</I>)</P>
<P>And then the secret police agent Ihring-Mahlow, here in Berlin,
who announced that he was prepared to teach the manufacture of
explosives, for &ldquo;the parliamentary way is too slow!&rdquo;
(<I>Laughter</I>)</P>
<P>What I mention here is no gossip and no fiction, all these facts
can be proven at any moment After all this experience, is there not
reason enough for us to ask, in connection also with an assassination
like the one recently committed in Geneva &ndash; who is behind that?</P>
<P>Of course Luccheni himself is an Anarchist, but, the same as
Hoedel, he is a man, neglected from his childhood up, spoiled and
demoralized by the miserable surroundings in which he lived. He is an
illegitimate child and grew up at first in a foundling asylum and
then outside, without education. Already at the age of ten he had to
earn his bread, to-day here, to-morrow elsewhere. Thus he grew up to
be the man who was able to commit such a senseless murder, as the one
that had the Empress of Austria for victim.</P>
<P>However, whether he acted on his own initiative or upon suggestion
from others &ndash; that is the question which, I hope, will be
sufficiently cleared up by the approaching trial in Geneva. [3] Long
before Luccheni killed the Austrian Empress, Italian police spies of
the worst type, such as Santoro, Mantica, Benedicti and similar
individuals of the most reprehensible past and present, were carrying
on their work in Geneva and Switzerland generally. In August of this
year there was a series of strikes among the workers of Geneva,
especially among those of the building industry. The leaders, Italian
Social Democrats, endeavored to establish peace between the
contending parties. They succeeded, but, strange to say, they were
expelled for it from Geneva. Santoro and Mantica had evidently their
hand in the case. Our Swiss comrades claim that these two Italian
police spies, assisted by the Italian general consul, Mr. Basso, were
stirring up the police of Geneva against our Italian comrades of that
city so long and so persistently, that they finally consented to
expel them. But it is remarkable that the real instigators and
trouble-makers in strikes remained unmolested, although these too,
must have been known to the police of Geneva. Then came the murder
committed by Luccheni and the police of Geneva got at last its eyes
opened. The miserable creatures that were carrying on their nefarious
work in Geneva were more closely examined from all sides, and
edifying things were discovered. The past of some of these fellows
was stained by crimes committed by them in Italy; still, many of them
were <I>in the employ of the political police of Italy</I>.</P>
<P>Is there any wonder, that our sister organ, the <B>Tagewacht</B>,
of Berne, Switzerland, declared in plain language that the murder
<I>committed by Luccheni</I> was in fact <I>committed by the royal
Italian police!</I> And the paper was not prosecuted for the
statement. To judge by their personal career these Italian secret
police agents are ready to commit any crime and rascality.</P>
<P>Who, for instance, is Santoro? He was a captain of police in
Florence. In 1891 dynamite outrages were in Italy a frequent
occurrence. One night the police of Florence arrested a suspicious
looking individual who carried some object under his cloak. That
object proved to be a bomb; <I>but the cloak under which the bomb was
carried belonged to &ndash; Santoro!</I> (<I>Laughter</I>) The
arrested individual, de Angeli, was put behind the bars, but Santoro
was appointed by Minister Crispi to the office of director of the
Porto Ercole penal colony. Here he maltreated the convicts in the
most outrageous manner, so that some of them died; he stole funds
appropriated for the food of the convicts, and pocketed moneys sent
to these unfortunate creatures by their relatives. When his crimes
became known the only punishment he received was removal from the
office. Then he placed his services at the command of the radical
deputy Cavalotti against Crispi, revealing to the former the various
iniquities committed by Crispi. Thr upshot of it was that Santoro was
placed on trial for the rascally and crooked work committed by him
while director of the Porto Ercole penal colony and he was sentenced
to <I>eight years imprisonment</I>. But he got a chance to escape,
and, reaching Switzerland, he <I>again entered the employ of the
Italian police</I>. In Switzerland, too, he continued his criminal
swindler&rsquo;s record and is now in jail awaiting trial.</P>
<P>And now Mantica. This fellow was expelled from the corps of
Italian officers for reasons unknown to me. At a tiial of Sicilian
barons, involving an estate, he attempted to bribe the jurymen and in
February of 1898 was sentenced to 13 months&rsquo; imprisonment. He,
too, escaped, and, like Santoro, entered the employ of the Italian
police in Switzerland and established close, confidential relations
with Mr. Basso, the Italian Consul General in Geneva, who shortly
after the Geneva murder was suddenly transferred to Corsica. In
Geneva Mantica was hanging around using an alias (de Sanctis), lived
in grand style and busied himself with amateur journalism and the
work of a secret police agent, and was in position to report the
Geneva assassination to Italy at a time when nobody knew anything
about it. His chief acquaintances were Anarchists &ndash; whom he was
madly persecuting &ndash; and Socialists in bad odor. Whether or not
it can be proven about the Italian police-Anarchists, that they had a
direct hand in the murder committed by Luccheni &ndash; his trial
will show. However, in Switzerland, no more than formerly in England,
does anybody think of using the Geneva murder as a pretext to demand
exceptional laws and that demonstrates the tremendous difference
between a democratic country and Germany. Even more, in the
government spheres as well as among the common people of Switzerland
there is much indignation at the Italian Government, which sends to
Switzerland those scoundrels of secret police agents and <I>agents
provocateurs</I>, and then has the audacity to attempt to prescribe
to Switzerland rules of conduct.</P>
<P>In the recently reported dynamite outrage in Egypt, too, the
Italian police was not unconcerned.</P>
<P>If there ever was one of those dynamite outrages that had all the
ear-marks of being a put-up job by the police it Is that dynamite
plot, that is alleged to have been &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; at
Alexandria, Egypt. It was characteristic that the first news of it
came from England. According to tl at dispatch a case of bombs was
about to be found on the premises of an Italian saloon-keeper. And I
really believe that the case was soon found &ndash; why not, they
knew just where it was! (<I>Much laughter</I>) The dispatch reported
that that case was deposited on the premises of a saloon-keeper by
the name of Parrini who, thinking that it contained whisky, proceeded
to open it with a hammer in the presence of the police. The police
papers write that he evidently intended to blow himself up. Oh, no.
He, in his innocence, might have honestly intended to open the case,
but the other fellows knew what it contained and they did not care to
be blown up. (<I>Laughter</I>) It is alleged that only Italians
participated in this conspiracy. How handy! &ndash; that gives the
Italian consul a chance to conduct the investigation all to himself.
(<I>Laughter</I>) It is also alleged that the arrested suspects had
in their possession copies of the <B>Agitatore</B>, &ndash; published
in Neuchatel, Switzerland &ndash; which urged the assassination of
King Humbert. That is an impudent yarn. If this allegation were true,
then the Swiss Federal Government at Berne would not merely expel the
editors of that paper but, on the strength of the well-known Swiss
law, the latter would have been sentenced to so-and-so many years of
penal servitude for inciting to acts of violence.</P>
<P>In short, silly lies are being circulated in a most outrageous
manner. But even if all those stories were true &ndash; what has
Germany to do with what happens there, in Alexandria, the meeting
place of the most suspicious characters of all Europe? Evidently the
notorious police inspector Melville, of London, too, again had his
dirty hand in the affair over there.</P>
<P>But there would be nothing surprising even if we should suppose
that some Italians really had a hand in such an affair. Unfortunately
it cannot be denied that many Italians readily incline to acts of
violence. That is the cause of the bitter animosity which
predominates in Switzerland against the Italian workmen. Many of them
are really too quick in drawing their knife. As you remember, there
was two years ago a riot in Zurich against Italians because one of
them had again stabbed a Swiss citizen during a quarrel over trifles.
Such and similar cases occur in Switzerland every week. On account of
such occurrences the prisons in Switzerland are filled with Italians.
Thus it happens, that the reports of such occurrences, read every
week in the press, have created an exceedingly bitter antagonism
against the large number of Italians living in Switzerland, although
the bulk of them are very industrious, sober workmen &ndash; that is
what makes the employers like them.</P>
<P>But are the Italians blood-thirsty by nature? One cannot claim
that. But they are very superstitious, ignorant and neglected in
their education. In addition to that the horrible legal conditions,
which existed for centuries, which inoculated among the people the
conviction that the people have absolutely no rights, have <I>developed
among them the idea of self-help</I>. Thus the man of the people
takes his law into his own hands in his home country, and then
practices the same thing abroad, even in a country where well
regulated legislation exists, for according to the belief acquired at
home he sees in self-help the best protection. It is thus that the
idea of self-help degenerates into its extreme, into unbridled
license and brings forth evil fruit, which causes much trouble,
especially in Switzerland.</P>
<P>One should always remember that every year tens of thousands of
young Italians are compelled by the extremely miserable social
conditions prevailing in their home country, to go abroad in search
of a job.</P>
<P>When united Italy was established in the fifties and sixties of
this century, most of the nations of Europe rejoiced at the event,
for it removed conditions from the Italian states &ndash; including
the Church state &ndash; which were a disgrace to the civilized
world. It appeared to be the mission of the reigning house of Savoy,
in whose interest this unity of Italy was primarily established, to
establish modern civilized conditions. But no country in Europe was
so thoroughly ruined by misrule in the course of a few decades as was
the Italian Kingdom. Aristocracy and the capitalists have so robbed
the country that the conditions there are now worse than ever. The
high indirect taxes levied in Italy exceed by far those paid in
Germany. In Southern Italy there is a tax of 18 centimes (about 3&frac12;
cents) on a kilo (about 2 pounds) of bread. Wages are miserable,
agricultural conditions shocking. Wide stretches of land are left
uncultivated. The owners of the land &ndash; the noblemen and
capitalists &ndash; are too lazy, too indolent and too dissipated;
they prefer to squander away in the beautiful cities and other places
of the country the fortunes that they squeeze out of the peasants and
workmen as tenants. The peasant is groaning under the worst
imaginuble rent conditions. Three hundred million francs
($60,000,000) are collected yearly in Italy as land-tax. But the
amount must be paid by the poor peasant and tenant. In Lombardy there
is a land-tax of 26 francs (over $5.00) on each hectare of land.</P>
<P>When one considers all these circumstances, one knows also who are
the true authors of those assassinations. (<I>Stormy applause</I>)
Right near the sacred Rome, the ancient seat of European
civilization, are the Pontine Marshes, the fever-breeding breath of
which destroys all life. Still the Italian government has no money to
transform them into flourishing fields. But there are plenty of
officials to rob the people, and, to maintain a great army and a
great navy, there are hundreds upon hundreds of millions squeezed in
taxes almost exclusively out of the hard working laborers.</P>
<P>In view of such conditions, that cry to Heaven, the Italian
government should be the last to presume to call an anti-Anarchist
conference. Not the Anarchists, but the <B>ministers of the Italian
Government</B> should be placed on trial. They are the ones that
should be placed behind the bars! (<I>Loud cries of approval and
applause</I>)</P>
<P>I am through and recommend for your adoption the following
resolution:</P>

<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="section">
<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>

			<P>The mass meeting held November 2nd, 1898, in Keller&rsquo;s
			Festival Hall, resolves:</P>
			<P>The meeting emphatically protests against any attempt to use
			the cold-blooded murder, committed at Geneva, Switzerland, on the
			Empress of Austria by a morally degenerate Italian, as a pretext
			for oppressive measures against opposition parties and factions in
			Germany, like the measures that were in vogue under the
			Exceptional Law.</P>
			<P>On the other hand the meeting recommends to the so-called
			Anarchist conference, called by the Italian government, and which
			is about to convene, to discuss the following question:</P>
			<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;How does it happen that the political assassins
			of recent years were all Italians and that so many Italians,
			living abroad, become notorious for their use of the knife?&rdquo;</p>
			<P>The meeting also recommends to the participants in the
			so-called Anarchist conference, after they have learned the causes
			of the above mentioned phenomenon, to demand of the Italian
			government that it energetically combat the unlimited physical and
			moral corruption and the social and political misrule, to which
			the working classes of the Italian Kingdom are subjected, on
			account of the heartless exploitation and oppression by the ruling
			and governing classes. They can shut off this source of
			demoralization and crime, as much as possible, by the adoption of
			thorough measures of social reform, by upholding right and justice
			and by granting fo the working classes political rights and
			liberties.</P>
			<P>Further, the meeting recommends to the so-called Anarchist
			conference to investigate how it happens that so many socalled
			&ldquo;Anarchists&rdquo; of the most dangerous character are found
			just among those persons who are entrusted with the posts of
			guardians of public order and safety, as was demonstrated, among
			other things, by the publications of the former Chief of Police
			Andrieux and the confessions of Ravachol in Paris, by the doings
			of Melville in London, by the actions of Pourbaix and the
			so-called Bomb-Baron von Ungern-Sternberg of Belgium, by the
			events that happened during the existence of the anti-Socialist
			law in Germany and simultaneously in Switzerland and in Austria &ndash;
			witness: Horsch, Schroeder, Haupt, von Ehrenberg, Ihring-Mahlow,
			Peukert-Vienna, etc. &ndash; further, by the conspiracy of Russian
			government organs in Bulgaria against Battenberg and Minister
			Stambulow, and quite recently by the intrigues and doings of the
			Italian police spies in Switzerland &ndash; Santoro, Mantica, etc.</P>
			<P>The meeting is of the opinion: That the so-called Anarchist
			conference of European powers has a thankful task to perform, if
			it tackles it properly and at last starts to sweep in the place
			where the dirt is mountain high! (<I>Loud applause</I>)</P>
		<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="section">
<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>
<P>The meeting adopted the resolution unanimously.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Footnotes</H3>
<P>1. To become a naturalized citizen of Switzerland one has to pay a
considerable sum, besides complying with other difficult
requirements. &ndash; <I>Translator</I>.</P>
<P>2. When the Socialists in Zurich became satisfied that Schroeder
and Haupt were secret agents of police of Germany, posing as
blood-thirsty revolutionists, they caused the police of Zurich to
search their residence. Quantities of dynamite, sums of money from
police headquarters of Berlin, and many documents were found in their
possession, establishing the above and many other similar facts and
proving beyond question, that the Berlin headquarters of police,
acting in conformity with the general policy of Bismarck&rsquo;s man,
Puttkamer, the Minister of Interior, were themselves initiating,
organizing and supplying dynamite, money, etc., for Anarchistic plots
of assassination, subsidizing Anarchistic publications, etc. Bebel
and Auer, representing the Social-Democratic Labor Party of Germany,
came down to Zurich, secured the necessary documents and at the first
opportunity deposited them on the table of the Reichstag as evidence
of Puttkamer&rsquo;s criminal policy of bloodshed. The sensation
created by these revelations was so tremendous all over Germany and
Europe the indignation so universal, that Puttkamer had to resign.</P>
<P>Bismarck, enraged at the scandal, used diplomatic pressure on the
powerless Federal Government of Switzerland to compel them to give a
calling down to the police of Zurich for having helped to unmask the
agents of the German police, and shortly after that he compelled the
Swiss Federal Government to expell from Switzerland Edward Bernstein,
Schlueter, Motteler and Tauscher, who were publishing in Zurich the
<B>Sozialdemokrat</B>, organ of the German Party, and were generally
looking after the Party&rsquo;s interests. &ndash; <I>Translator</I>.</P>
<P>3. Concerning the question of accomplices the indictment states
that Lnccheni emphatically denies having had any; that although no
actual participation of an accomplice in his deed is established, it
is still possible that the idea of committing that crime is not his
own; that while Luccheni is undoubtedly the man who chiefly
instigated and directly carried out the crime, still there is a
certain reserve in his conduct which, in connection with the evident
discrepancies in his statements, points to the fact that Luccheni has
much to hide, and that can only be done in the interest of others.
During the trial in Geneva, which, as we know, was public, this
question was scarcely referred to.</P>
