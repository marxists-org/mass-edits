<P><a name="Introduction"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<P>Appearing before you in fulfillment of the constitutional mandate,
I attribute twofold importance to this message. It is the first
message of a Government which has just taken office, and it
corresponds to unique demands in our political history.</P>
<P>For this reason I wish to give it special substance, because of
its present significance and because of its implications for the
future.</P>
<P>For 27 years, I have attended this House, nearly always as a
member of the parliamentary opposition. Today I attend as Chief of
State, elected by the will of the people as ratified by Congress.</P>
<P>I am well aware that here were debated and established the laws
which set up an agrarian structure based on big estates; but here
too, obsolete institutions were abolished in order to lay the legal
foundations of the land reform which we are now carrying out. Here
were established the institutional procedures for the foreign
exploitation of Chilean national resources; but this same Congress is
now revising these in order to return to the Chilean people what
belongs to them by right.</P>
<P>Congress makes the legal institutions which regulate the social
order in which they are rooted; for this reason, for more than a
century, it has been more responsive to the interests of the powerful
than to the suffering of the people.</P>
<P>At the very commencement of this legislative period, I must raise
this problem. Chile now has in its Government a new political force
whose social function is to uphold, not the traditional ruling class,
but the vast majority of the people. This change in the power
structure must necessarily be accompanied by profound changes in the
socio-economic order, changes which Parliament is summoned to
institutionalise.</P>
<P>This step forward in the liberation of Chilean energies for the
rebuilding of the nation must be followed by more decisive steps. The
land reform which is now in progress, the nationalisation of copper
which is only awaiting the approval of Plenary Congress, must be
followed by new reforms - whether these are initiated by Parliament
or by Government proposal, or by the combined efforts of both powers,
or by plebiscite, which is a legal appeal to the foundation of all
power, the sovereignty of the people.</P>
<P>We have accepted the challenge to re-examine everything. We
urgently wish to ask of every law, every existing institution and
even of every person whether or not they are furthering our integral
and autonomous development. I am sure that on few occasions in
history has the Parliament of any nation been presented with so great
a challenge.</P>
<P><a name="Overcoming_Capitalism_in_Chile"></a></P>
<h3>Overcoming Capitalism in Chile</h3>
<P>The circumstances of Russia in 1917 and of Chile at the present
time are very different. Nevertheless, the historic challenge is
similar.</P>
<P>In 1917, Russia took decisions which have had the most
far-reaching effects on contemporary history. There it was believed
that backward Europe could face up to advanced Europe, that the first
socialist revolution need not necessarily take place in the heart of
industrial power. There the challenge was accepted and the
dictatorship of the proletariat, which is one of the methods of
building a socialist society, was established.</P>
<P>Today nobody doubts that by this method nations with a large
population can, in a relatively short period, break out of their
backwardness and attain the most advanced level of contemporary
civilisation. The examples of the Soviet Union and of the Chinese
People's Republic speak for themselves.</P>
<P>Like Russia then, Chile now faces the need to initiate new methods
of constructing a socialist society. Our revolutionary method, the
pluralist method, was anticipated by the classic Marxist theorists
but never before put into practice. Social thinkers believed that the
first to do so would be the more developed nations, probably Italy or
France with their powerful Marxist-oriented working-class parties.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, once again, history has permitted a break with the
past and the construction of a new model of society, not only where
it was theoretically most predictable but where the most favourable
concrete conditions had been created for its achievement. Today Chile
is the first nation on earth to put into practice the second model of
transition to a socialist society.</P>
<P>This challenge is awakening great interest beyond our national
frontiers. Everybody knows or guesses that here and now history is
beginning to take a new direction, even as we Chileans are conscious
of the undertaking. Some among us, perhaps the minority, see the
enormous difficulties of the task. Others, the majority, are trying
to envisage the possibility of facing it successfully. For my part, I
am sure that we shall have the necessary energy and ability to carry
on our effort and create the first socialist society built according
to a democratic, pluralistic and libertarian model.</P>
<P>The sceptics and the prophets of doom will say that it is not
possible. They will say that a parliament that has served the ruling
classes so well cannot be transformed into the Parliament of the
Chilean People.</P>
<P>Further, they have emphatically stated that the Armed Forces and
the Corps of Carabineros, who have up to the present supported the
institutional order that we wish to overcome, would not consent to
guarantee the will of the people if these should decide on the
establishment of socialism in our country. They forget the patriotic
conscience of the Armed Forces and the Carabineros, their tradition
of professionalism and their obedience to civil authority. In the
words of General Schneider, the Armed Forces are &quot;an integral
and representative part of the nation as well as of the State
structure, that is, they belong both to the permanent and the
temporary spheres, and are therefore able to organise and
counter-balance the periodic changes which affect political life
within a legal regime&quot;. Since the National Congress is based on
the people's vote, there is nothing in its nature which prevents it
from changing itself in order to become, in fact, the Parliament of
the People. The Chilean Armed Forces and the Carabineros, faithful to
their duty and to their tradition of non-intervention in the
political process, will support a social organisation which
corresponds to the will of the people as expressed in the terms of
the established Constitution. It will be a more just, a more humane
and generous organisation for everybody, but above all for the
workers, who have contributed so much up to the present and have
received almost nothing in return.</P>
<P>The difficulties we face are not in this field. They reside in the
extraordinary complexity of the tasks before us - to create the
political institutions which will lead to Socialism, and to achieve
this starting from our present condition of a society oppressed by
backwardness and poverty which are the result of dependence and
under- development - to break with the factors which cause
backwardness and, at the same time, to build a new socio-economic
structure capable of providing for collective prosperity.</P>
<P>The causes of backwardness resided and still reside in the
traditional ruling classes with their combination of dependence on
external forces and internal class exploitation. They have profited
from their association with foreign interests, and from their
appropriation of the surplus produced by the workers, to whom they
have only awarded the minimum indispensable for the renewal of their
labouring capacities.</P>
<P>Our first task is to dismantle this restrictive structure, which
only produces a deformed growth. At the same time, we must build up a
new economy so that it succeeds the previous one without continuing
it, at the same time conserving to the maximum the productive and
technical capacity that we have achieved despite the vicissitudes of
our under- development - and we must build it up without crises
artificially provoked by those whose ancient privileges we shall
abolish.</P>
<P>In addition to these basic questions, there is another which is an
essential challenge of our time - how can people in general - and
young people in particular - develop a sense of mission which will
inspire them with a new joy in living and give dignity to their
existence?</P>
<P>There is no other way than that of devoting ourselves to the
realisation of great impersonal tasks, such as that of attaining a
new stage in the human condition, until now degraded by its division
into the privileged and the dispossessed. Today nobody can imagine
solutions for the distant future when all nations will have attained
abundance and realised the satisfaction of material needs and at the
same time have assumed the cultural heritage of humanity. But here
and now in Chile and in Latin America, we have the possibility and
the duty of releasing creative energies, particularly those of youth,
in missions which inspire us more than any in the past. Such is the
aspiration to build a world which does away with divisions into rich
and poor - and for our part, to build a society in which the war of
economic competition is outlawed - in which the struggle for
professional privileges has no meaning - in which there is no longer
that indifference to the fate of others which permits the powerful to
exploit the weak.</P>
<P>There have been few occasions in which men have needed so much
faith in themselves and in their capacity to rebuild the world and
regenerate their lives.</P>
<P>This is an unprecedented time, which offers us the material means
of realising the most generous utopian dreams of the past. The only
thing that prevents our achieving this is the heritage of greed, of
fear and of obsolete institutional traditions. Between our time and
that of the liberation of man on a planetary scale, this inheritance
has to be overcome. Only in this way will it be possible to call upon
men to reconstruct their lives, not as products of a past of slavery
and exploitation, but in the most conscious realisation of their
noblest potentialities. This is the socialist ideal.</P>
<P>An ingenious observer from some developed country which has these
material resources might suppose that this observation is a new
manner that backward people have found of asking for aid - yet
another plea of the poor for the charity of the rich. Such is not the
case, but its opposite. With the internal authority of all societies
brought under the hegemony of the dispossessed, with the change in
international trade relations stimulated by the exploited nations,
there will come about not only the abolition of poverty and
backwardness but also the liberation of the great powers from their
despot's fate. Thus, in the same way as the emancipation of the slave
liberates the slaveowner, so the achievement of Socialism envisaged
by the peoples of our time is as meaningful for the disinherited
peoples as for the more privileged, since both will then cast away
the chains which degrade their society.</P>
<P>I stand here, members of the National Congress, to urge you to
take up the task of reconstructing the Chilean nation according to
our dreams, a Chile in which all children begin life equally, with
equal medical care, education, and nutrition. A Chile in which the
creative ability of each man and woman is allowed to develop, not in
competition with others, but in order to contribute to a better life
for all.</P>
<P><a name="Our_road_to_Socialism"></a></P>
<h3>Our road to Socialism</h3>
<P>To achieve these aspirations means a long road and a great effort
on the part of all Chileans. It also implies, as a basic
prerequisite, that we are able to establish the institutional
apparatus of a new form of pluralistic, free socialist order. The
task is one of extraordinary complexity because there are no
precedents for us to follow. We are treading a new path. We are
advancing without guides across unknown territory, but our compass is
our faith in the humanism of all ages and particularly in Marxist
humanism. Our aim is the establishment of the society that we want,
the society which answers the deep-rooted desires of the Chilean
people.</P>
<P>For a long time, science and technology have made it possible to
assure that everybody enjoys those basic necessities which today are
enjoyed only by a minority. The difficulties are not technical, and -
in our case at least - they are not due to a lack of national
resources. What prevents the realisation of our ideals is the
organisation of society, the nature of the interests which have so
far dominated, the obstacles which dependent nations face. We must
concentrate our attention on these structures and on these
institutional requirements.</P>
<P>Speaking frankly, our task is to define and put into practice, as
the Chilean road to socialism, a new model of the State, of the
economy and of society which revolves around man's needs and
aspirations. For this we need the determination of those who have
dared to reconsider the world in terms of a project designed for the
service of man. There are no previous experiments that we can use as
models - we shall have to develop the theory and practice of new
forms of social, political and economic organisation, both in order
to break with under-development and create socialism.</P>
<P>We can achieve this only on condition that we do not overshoot or
depart from our objective. If we should forget that our mission is to
establish a social plan for man, the whole struggle of our people for
socialism will become simply one more reformist experiment. If we
should forget the concrete conditions from which we start in order to
try and create immediately something which surpasses our
possibilities, then we shall also fail.</P>
<P>We are moving towards socialism, not from an academic love for a
doctrinaire system, but encouraged by the strength of our people, who
know that it is an inescapable demand if we are to overcome
backwardness and who feel that a socialist regime is the only way
available to modern nations who want to build rationally in freedom,
independence and dignity. We are moving towards socialism because the
people, through their vote, have freely rejected capitalism as a
system which has resulted in a crudely unequal society, a society
deformed by social injustice and degraded by the deterioration of the
very foundations of human solidarity.</P>
<P>In the name of the socialist reconstruction of Chilean society, we
have won the presidential elections, a victory that was confirmed by
the election of municipal councillors. This is the flag behind which
we are mobilising the people politically both as the object of our
plans and as the justification for our actions. Our Government plans
are those of the Popular Unity platform on which we fought the
election. In putting them into effect, we shall not sacrifice
attention to the present needs of the Chilean people in favour of
gigantic schemes. Our objective in none other than the progressive
establishment of a new structure of power, founded on the will of the
majority and designed to satisfy in the shortest possible time the
most urgent needs of the present generation.</P>
<P>Sensitivity to the claims of the people is in fact the only way we
have of contributing to the solution of the great human problems -
for no universal value is worth the name if it cannot be applied on
the national or regional scale and even to the local living
conditions of each family.</P>
<P>Our policy might seem too simple for those who prefer big
promises. But the people need decent housing for their families, with
proper sanitation - they need schools for their children which are
not expressly intended for the poor - they need enough to eat every
day of the year - they need work - they need care during sickness and
in old age - they need to be respected as people. That is what we
hope to offer all Chileans in the foreseeable future. This is what
has been denied the people in Latin America throughout the centuries.
This is what some nations are now beginning to guarantee their entire
population.</P>
<P>But beyond this task, and as a fundamental prerequisite for its
achievement, there is another equally important one. It is to engage
the will of the Chilean people to dedicate our hands, our minds and
our feelings to the reassertion of our identity as a people, in order
to become an integral part of contemporary civilisation as masters of
our fate and heirs to the patrimony of technical skills, knowledge,
art and culture. Turning the nation's attention to these fundamental
aspirations is the only way to satisfy the people's needs and to wipe
out the differences between them and the privileged classes. Above
all, it is the only way to provide the young with a mission by
opening up broad perspectives of a fruitful existence as builders of
the society in which they will live.</P>
<P>The mandate entrusted to us embraces all the nation's material and
spiritual resources. We have reached a point at which retreat or a
standstill would mean an irreparable national catastrophe. It is my
obligation at this time, as the one primarily responsible for the
fate of Chile, to indicate clearly the road which we are taking and
the dangers and hopes which it offers.</P>
<P>The Popular Government knows that the transcendence of a
historical period is determined by social and economic factors which
have already been shaped by this same period. These factors embrace
the agents and modes of historical change. To ignore this would be to
go against the nature of things.</P>
<P>In the revolutionary process which we are living through, there
are five essential points upon which we shall concentrate our social
and political campaign - the principle of legality, the development
of institutions, political freedom, the prevention of violence, and
the socialisation of the means of production. These are questions
which affect the present and future of every citizen.</P>
<P><a name="The_principle_of_legality"></a></P>
<h3>The principle of legality</h3>
<P>Legality is a governing principle today in Chile. It has been
achieved as a result of the struggle of many generations against
absolutism and the arbitrary exercise of State power. It is an
irreversible achievement for as long as differences exist between
rulers and ruled.</P>
<P>It is not the principle of legality which the mass movements are
protesting against. We are protesting against a legal system whose
basic assumptions reflect an oppressive social order. Our legal norms
and the regulating machinery of Chilean social relationships
correspond at the present time to the needs of the capitalist system.
In the transition to socialism, legal norms will correspond to the
needs of a people engaged in building a new society. But there will
be legality.</P>
<P>Our legal system must be modified. Hence the great responsibility
of the two Houses at the present time - to help and not to hinder the
changes in this system. On whether the Congress takes a realistic
attitude depends to a great extent whether capitalist legality will
be succeeded by socialist legality in conformity with the social and
economic changes we are making and without a violent break in
jurisdiction which would open the door to arbitrary acts and excesses
which we, as responsible people, wish to avoid.</P>
<P><a name="Development_of_institutions"></a></P>
<h3>Development of institutions</h3>
<P>The obligation to organise and govern society according to the
rule of law is inherent in our system of institutions. The struggle
of the popular movements and parties which are now in the Government
has contributed greatly to one of the most promising situations
obtained in this country. We have an open system which has defied
even those who would seek to infringe upon the will of the people.</P>
<P>The flexibility of our institutions allows us to hope that they
will not be a bitter bone of contention. And that, like our legal
system, they will adapt to new needs in order to give rise, by
constitutional means, to the new institutions required by the
overthrow of capitalism.</P>
<P>The new institutions will conform to the principle which justifies
and guides our actions, that is, the transference of political and
economic power to the workers and to the people as a whole. In order
to make this possible, the first priority is the socialisation of the
basic means of production.</P>
<P>At the same time, political institutions must be adjusted to this
new situation. For this reason we shall, at an opportune moment,
submit to the sovereign will of the people the necessity of replacing
the present Constitution, with its liberal foundations, by a
Constitution of a socialist nature and of replacing the bicameral
system by a single House.</P>
<P>It is in accordance with this that we have committed ourselves in
our Government programme to the realisation of our revolutionary task
while respecting the rule of law. It is not simply a formal
commitment but an explicit recognition that the principles of
legality and institutional order are inseparable from a socialist
regime despite the difficulties involved in the transitional period.</P>
<P>To maintain these institutions while changing their class basis
during this difficult period is an ambitious undertaking of decisive
importance for the new social order. Nevertheless, its achievement
does not depend solely on our will. It will depend fundamentally on
the planning of our social and economic structure, on its short-term
evolution and on the degree of realism shown by our people in their
political action. At the moment we believe that it is possible and we
are acting upon that assumption.</P>
<P><a name="Political_freedom"></a></P>
<h3>Political freedom</h3>
<P>It is also important to remember that for us, as representatives
of the popular forces, political freedom represents the achievement
of the people on the difficult road to emancipation. It is an element
of real achievement in the historical period that we are now leaving
behind. And for this reason, freedom must remain. That is why we
respect freedom of conscience for all creeds. That is why we are
happy to underline the words of the Cardinal Archbishop of Santiago,
Raul Silva Henriquez, in his message to the workers - &quot;The
Church which I represent is the Church of Jesus, the son of a
carpenter. It began as such, and as such we go on loving it. Its
greatest sorrow is that people believe it has forgotten its cradle,
which is among the humble&quot;.</P>
<P>But we would not be revolutionaries if we limited ourselves simply
to preserving political freedom. The Popular Unity Government will
strengthen political liberties. It is not sufficient to proclaim them
verbally, because this makes them a source of frustration or mockery.
We shall make them real, tangible, and concrete, and practicable in
the process of achieving economic freedom.</P>
<P>In consequence, the Popular Government bases its policy on a
premise which some people artificially reject, that is, on the
existence of social classes and sectors with opposing and mutually
exclusive interests, and on the existence of unequal political levels
within the same class or group.</P>
<P>In the face of this diversity, our Government is concerned with
the interests of all those who earn their living by their own labour
- workers, members of the professions, technicians, artists,
intellectuals, and white-collar workers. These are a group which is
growing as a result of capitalist development and becoming more
united because of its members' common condition as wage-earners. For
the same reason, the Government gives protection to both the small
and the medium-sized business sectors, that is, to all sectors which,
to a greater or lesser extent, are exploited by the minority who hold
the centres of power.</P>
<P>The multi-party coalition of the Popular Government corresponds to
this reality. And in the daily confrontation of its interests with
those of the ruling classes, it uses the techniques of bargaining and
agreement established by the legal system, recognising at the same
time the political freedom of the opposition and keeping its own
actions within institutional limitations. Political freedom
represents the achievement of the entire Chilean people as a nation.</P>
<P>As President of the Republic, I have fully ratified all these
principles of action, which are supported by our revolutionary
political theory, conform to the present national situation, and are
included in the programme of the Popular Unity Government.</P>
<P>They form part of our plan for developing to the maximum the
political potentialities of our country so that the stage of
transition towards socialism will be characterised by the selective
overcoming of the present system. This will be achieved by destroying
or abandoning its negative and oppressive features and by
strengthening and broadening its positive features.</P>
<P><a name="Violence"></a></P>
<h3>Violence</h3>
<P>The Chilean people are achieving political power without having
used arms. They are taking the road of social emancipation having had
to fight only the limitations of a liberal democracy and not a
despotic or dictatorial regime. Our people legitimately hope to go
through the stage of transition to socialism without having recourse
to authoritarian forms of government.</P>
<P>Our wishes are very clear on this point. But the responsibility
for guaranteeing the political evolution towards socialism does not
reside only in the government and in those movements and parties
which it comprises. Our people have stood up to the institutionalised
violence which the present capitalist system has held over them. And
it is for this reason we are changing the basis of that system.</P>
<P>My government owes its existence to the popular will freely
expressed. It answers to this alone. The movements and parties which
are included in it give direction to the revolutionary conscience of
the masses and express the people's interests. At the same time, they
are directly responsible to the people.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, it is my duty to warn you that a danger may threaten
the straight road to emancipation and could radically alter the
direction which our situation and our collective conscience have
marked out for us. This danger is violence directed against the
people's determination.</P>
<P>Should violence from within or without, should violence in any
form, whether physical, economic, social or political, happen to
threaten our normal development and the achievement of our workers,
then the integrity of our institutions, the rule of law, political
freedom and pluralism will be put in the greatest danger. The fight
for social emancipation and for the free determination of our people
would necessarily take a different form from that which we, with
legitimate pride and historical realism, call the Chilean road to
socialism. The determined attitude of the Government and the
revolutionary energy of the people, the democratic resolution of the
Armed Forces and the Carabineros, will see that Chile advances surely
along the road to emancipation.</P>
<P>The unity of the popular forces and the good sense of the middle
sectors give us the necessary superiority to prevent the privileged
minority from having recourse to violence. If violence is not
released against the people, we shall be able to change the basic
structures on which the capitalist system rests into a democratic,
pluralistic and free society, and to do this without unnecessary
physical force, without institutional disorder, without disorganising
production, and at a speed which the Government will determine
according to the needs of the people and the level of development of
our resources.</P>
<P><a name="Attainment_of_social_freedom"></a></P>
<h3>Attainment of social freedom</h3>
<P>Our aim is the attainment of social freedom through the exercise
of political freedom, and this requires the establishment of economic
equality as a basis. This is the road which the people have decided
upon because they know that the revolutionary transformation of a
social system must go through intermediate stages. A revolution that
is simply political may consume itself in a few weeks. A social and
economic revolution takes years. Time is necessary for the conscience
of the masses to be penetrated, for new structures to be organised
and made operable as well as to be adapted to the existing ones. It
is sheer utopianism to imagine that the intermediary stages can be
skipped. It is not possible to destroy a social and economic
structure and existing social institutions without at least having
first developed a replacement. If the natural exigencies of
historical change are not recognised, then reality will remind us of
them.</P>
<P>We are very well aware of the lesson of victorious revolutions,
the revolutions of those countries which, faced with foreign pressure
and civil war, had to speed up their social and economic revolution
in order not to fall back into bloody despotism and
counter-revolution. Only recently, decades afterwards, have they
organised the necessary structures for the definitive overthrow of
the previous regime.</P>
<P>The direction which my Government has planned takes into account
these facts. We know that to change the capitalist system while
respecting law, institutions and political freedoms demands that we
confine within certain limits our actions in the economic, political
and social fields. This is perfectly well known to every Chilean.
These limits are indicated in the Government programme which is being
carried out resolutely and without concessions, and in the manner and
at the speed which we have previously made known.</P>
<P>The Chilean people, showing their increasing maturity and
organisation, have entrusted the Popular Government with the defense
of their interests. This forces the Government to act on the basis of
its total identification and integration with the masses whose will
it interprets and directs, and prevents it from growing away from the
masses and acting in a dilatory or precipitate manner. Today more
than ever, the accord between the people, the popular parties and the
Government must be precise and dynamic.</P>
<P>Every historical change corresponds to conditions established at
previous stages and creates the elements and agents which are to
follow. To pass the transitional stage without restriction of their
political liberties, withstage without restriction of their political
liberties, without having a legal or institutional vacuum, is a right
and a legitimate demand of our people, its full material realisation
in concrete terms being presumed in a socialist society. The Popular
Government will fulfil its responsibility at this decisive time.</P>
<P>The principal constructive agent of the new regime consists in the
organisation and the conscience of our people, in permanent
mobilisation in different forms, according to the objective needs of
each moment.</P>
<P>We hope that this responsibility, which is not necessarily that of
the Government alone, is shared by the Christian Democratic Party,
which must demonstrate consistency in adhering to the principles and
programmes which it has so often laid before the country.</P>
<P><a name="Socialisation_of_the_means_of_production"></a></P>
<h3>Socialisation of the means of production</h3>
<P>In 6 months of Government, we have acted with decision on all
fronts. Our economic work has been aimed at breaking down the
barriers which impede the complete fulfilment of our material and
human potentialities. In 6 months of Government, we have advanced
energetically along the path of irrevocable change. The printed
statement which we have just distributed gives a full and detailed
account of our activities.</P>
<P>Chile has begun the definitive recovery of our most fundamental
source of wealth - copper. The nationalisation of our copper is not
an act of vengeance or hatred directed towards any group, government
or nation. We are, on the contrary, positively exercising an
inalienable right on behalf of a sovereign people - that of the full
enjoyment of our national resources exploited by our national labour
and effort. The recovery of copper is a decision by the whole of
Chile, and we demand that all countries and governments respect the
unanimous decision of a free people. We shall pay for the copper if
it is right to pay, and we shall not pay if it is unjust. We shall
watch over our interests. But we shall be implacable if we find out
that negligence or fraudulent activity on the part of any persons or
entities has harmed the country.</P>
<P>We have nationalised another of our basic resources - iron. A
short time ago, negotiations with the Bethlehem corporation were
concluded, and as a result, iron mining passed over completely to
public ownership. We are now studying the constitution of the
national steel complex which will group 6 companies together around
the CAP (Pacific Steel Industry). The agreement with North American
industry has once again shown that the Government is offering a fair
settlement to foreign capital without sacrificing the fundamental
interests of our nation. But we are not prepared to tolerate the
contempt for our laws and the lack of respect for established
authority that we find in some foreign firms. We have also taken over
coal as collective property (via the Development Corporation).</P>
<P>The nitrate resources are also ours. According to a settlement by
the previous government, we owed $24m in debentures payable in 15
years, which with interest amounts to $38m. The shares belonging to
the North American sector were theoretically worth $25m. All this has
now been redeemed for $8m payable in 2 years.</P>
<P>We have incorporated various firms - among them Purina, Lanera
Austral, and the Bellavista Tome, Fiap, and the Fabrilana textile
plants - into the area of public ownership - we have requisitioned
the cement industry and the Yarur (textile) industry when supplies
were threatened. In order to prevent bankruptcy, we have acquired an
important share of the assets of the Zig Zag Publishing House, which
forms a big part of our graphics and publishing industry, so that it
can satisfy the social needs of the new Chile.</P>
<P>In all the firms that have been taken into public ownership, the
nation can bear witness to the determined support of the workers, the
immediate increase in productivity, and the active participation of
workers, white- collar personnel and technicians in management and
administration.</P>
<P>We have speeded up land reform and have already achieved a major
part of this year's plan - the expropriation of one thousand big
estates. The reform is going forward in accordance with existing
legislation, and is protecting the interests of the small and
medium-sized farmers. We want to build up a new and more vigorous
agriculture, more solid in organisation and more productive. We want
the men who work the land to benefit fairly from the fruits of their
labour. The state ownership of banks has been a decisive step. With
absolute respect for the rights of the small shareholder, we have
established state control over 9 banks and are on the point of
obtaining majority control in the others. On the basis of previous
experience, we are hoping for a reasonable settlement with foreign
banks. We are thus trying to gain control of the financial apparatus
and to widen the social area in the sectors which produce material
goods. We want to place the new banking system at the service of the
socialised area and of the small and medium-sized industrialists,
merchants and farmers, who until now have been discriminated against.</P>
<P><a name="Our_present_economic_policy"></a></P>
<h3>Our present economic policy</h3>
<P>These have been our first acts towards the initiation of the
essential and definitive change in our economy. But we have done not
only this. We have also planned a short-term policy whose central
objective has been to increase the availability of material goods and
services for consumption, and we have directed that increase towards
the less favoured sectors.</P>
<P>We are carrying on a fierce struggle against inflation, and this
is the key to our policy of redistribution. The fight against
inflation has acquired a new political connotation - it will be a
dynamic element in the popular struggle. To halt the rise in prices
means that the people will maintain the increased spending power that
has been given them, and this will be definitively consolidated with
the deeper entrenchment of socialist organisation. At the same time,
independent businessmen can earn fair profits, the higher volume of
production compensating for the smaller profits on each item.</P>
<P>In practice this policy has borne appreciable fruits in terms of
redistribution. Nevertheless, we know that this planned reactivation
faces obstacles. On the one hand, some groups of businesses are
attempting to hinder the success of our measures by means of an open
or a covert slowdown in production. On the other hand, some sectors
which are imprisoned in a traditional model of low production and
high profit lack audacity and are unable to understand the present
juncture or to play a greater part in the productive process. To do
so is, nevertheless, their social duty. To those who do not fulfil
this duty, whether deliberately or not, we shall apply all the legal
resources within our power to go on urging them and, if necessary, to
make them produce more.</P>
<P>We are also carrying out a social policy to improve the diet of
our children - to provide speedier medical care - to increase
substantially the capacity of the educational system - to initiate
the necessary housing construction programme - and to plan greater
absorption of the unemployed as an urgent national need. We are doing
this without disorder and with justice, endeavouring always to keep
the social cost as low as possible. Today the citizen of our nation
has greater buying power, consumes more and feels that the fruit of
the common effort is better distributed. At the same time, he has the
right to feel that he owns the mines, the banks, industry and the
land, that he owns the future.</P>
<P>We are neither measuring ourselves against nor comparing ourselves
with previous governments. We are fundamentally different. But if
that comparison were to be made, using even the most traditional
indicators, we would come out favourably. We have achieved the lowest
rate of inflation in recent years - we have begun the most effective
redistribution of revenues that Chile has ever seen. We shall build
more houses this year than have ever been built before in a similar
period. Despite the gloomy predictions, we have maintained the normal
flow in supplies of essential goods.</P>
<P><a name="Limits_on_Government_action"></a></P>
<h3>Limits on Government action</h3>
<P>We are fundamentally different from previous governments. This
Government will always speak the truth to the people. I believe it is
my duty to state honestly that we have committed mistakes - that
unforeseen difficulties are slowing down the execution of plans and
programs. But although the copper produced was not up to the target
and although nitrate production did not reach a million tons,
although we did not build all the houses that we planned, in each one
of these sectors we have surpassed the highest rates that our country
has ever recorded. We have not managed to coordinate adequately the
various institutions of the State sector, owing to inefficiency in
some decisions. But we are designing more expeditious methods of
rationalising and planning.</P>
<P>Immediately on assuming power, we set ourselves to fulfil our
promises to the country. Together with the Central Workers'
Federation we studied the Readjustments Law and signed the
CWF-Government agreement. We have sent a bill to congress in which we
propose for the public sector a pay rise 100% equal to the rise in
the cost of living, and an increase on a greater scale in the
corresponding minimum wages in the private sector. But I believe it
was a mistake not to come to a broad agreement with the workers in
order to arrive at more precise readjustments applicable in both the
public and private sectors.</P>
<P>Another limitation that we have suffered lies in the
administrative, legal and procedural deficiencies of some of the
basic Government plans. For this reason the housing project, for
example, got off to a slow start - and this has prevented the
reactivation of certain industries and the absorption of a greater
number of unemployed. In the months of April and May, economic
activity connected with building began to get under way.</P>
<P>There is a vast area of public activity, comprising the public
service sector, where there are deep-rooted evils. Millions of
Chileans are the daily victims of bureaucratic paperwork, of delays
and red tape. Each step requires dozens of transactions, forms,
signatures and official stamps. How many hours are lost by every
Chilean in his fight against red tape, how much creative energy is
lost, how much useless irritation suffered. The Government
authorities have still not directed sufficient effort towards
eradicating this endemic evil. The most responsible sectors of
white-collar workers have called attention to it.</P>
<P>We have also moved slowly in outlining the social machinery for
the participation of the people. The bill which will give legal
status to the CWF is now ready - it will institutionalise the
participation of the workers in the political, social and economic
management both of the state and of economic enterprises. But we have
barely outlined the form their participation will take in the
regions, in the communities and in private organisations. We ought to
guarantee not only a vertical participation of workers in their
separate branches - that of industrial workers, for example, in their
plants - but also a horizontal participation which allows peasants,
manufacturing workers, miners, white-collar workers and members of
the professions to come together and discuss the problems of a
particular economic region or of the country as a whole. These types
of participation not only tend to bring about a fairer distribution
of income but also help to ensure a greater yield.</P>
<P>This horizontal integration of the people is not easy and will
doubtless require political maturity and collective consciousness,
but it is well for us to start realising now that the improvement of
production on a collective farm depends also on workers in machinery
and in tool and fertiliser plants, on the workers who build new
roads, and on the small and medium-sized merchants who distribute the
goods. Production is the responsibility of the working class as a
whole.</P>
<P>Another criticism which we have to make of ourselves is that these
first 6 months we have still not managed to mobilise the
intellectual, artistic and professional capacity of many Chileans.
There is some way to go before all scientists, members of the
professional classes, builders, artists, technicians, householders,
all those who can and wish to cooperate in the transformation of
society, find a place in which they can use their talents.</P>
<P><a name="Immediate_tasks"></a></P>
<h3>Immediate tasks</h3>
<P>In the remaining months of 1971, copper will definitely come under
Chilean ownership. On the efforts of the workers, white-collar
personnel and technicians of the Chuquicamata, El Teniente, Exotica,
El Salvador and Andina mines depends to a great extent the volume of
production which we shall achieve this year, and therefore our
ability to obtain foreign exchange and so maintain normal supplies
and realise our investment programmes. Copper represents the
livelihood of Chile. Those who administer this wealth and those who
extract it from the earth hold in their hands not only their own
destiny and their own well-being but also the destiny and well-being
of all Chileans.</P>
<P>We must extend land reform and if necessary modify the law, for if
copper is Chile's livelihood, the land is its bread.</P>
<P>The land must be made to produce more. This is the responsibility
of the peasants and of the small and medium-sized landowners, but the
Government recognises its mistakes and it is fair that others should
also recognise theirs. The occupation of land by squatters, the
indiscriminate occupation of agricultural terrains, are unnecessary
and harmful. Belief in the Government is warranted by what we have
done and by our attitudes. For this reason, the plans made by the
Government and the time fixed for their execution must be respected.
We invite political groups and individuals who are not in the Popular
Unity to meditate seriously upon this.</P>
<P>The creation of the area of social ownership is one of our great
objectives. The incorporation into this area of the major part of our
basic wealth, the banks, the big estates and a large proportion of
our foreign trade as well as of industrial and distributive
monopolies is a task that we have already begun and that must now be
amplified.</P>
<P>On the economic plane, the establishment of socialism means
replacing the capitalist mode of production by a qualitative change
in the relations of ownership - it also implies a redefinition of the
relations of production. In this context, the creation of the area of
social ownership has a human, political and economic significance.
The incorporation of large sectors of the productive apparatus into a
system of collective ownership puts an end to the exploitation of the
worker, creates a deep feeling of solidarity, and permits the
individual worker and his efforts to form part of the common work and
the common endeavour.</P>
<P>In the political field, the working class knows that it is
fighting for the socialisation of our principle means of production.
There is no socialism without an area of social ownership. To
incorporate new firms day by day requires a permanent state of
vigilance on the part of the working class. It also requires a high
degree of responsibility. To construct socialism is not an easy task
- it is not a short task. It is a long and difficult task in which
the working class ought to participate in a disciplined, organised
and politically responsible manner, avoiding anarchistic decisions
and inconsistent voluntarism.</P>
<P>The importance of the public sector is traditional in our country.
Approximately 40% of spending is public. More than 70% of investment
is of State origin. The public sector was created by the national
bourgeoisie in order to promote private accumulation and to
consolidate the means of production, concentrating their
technological resources and ownership.</P>
<P>Our government wants to make this sector quantitatively more
important, but also to make it qualitatively different.</P>
<P>The State apparatus has been used by monopolies for the purpose of
relieving their financial difficulties, for obtaining economic help
and for strengthening the system. Up to now the public sector has
been characterised by its subsidiary role in relation to the private
sector. For this reason some public enterprises show large total
deficits, while others are unable to produce profits comparable in
size to those of some private enterprises.</P>
<P>Besides, the state machinery of Chile has lacked the necessary
coordination between its different activities. As long as this is the
case, it will be impossible for it to make a decisive contribution to
a socialist economy. The control of some branches of production does
not mean that the public sector has the machinery to direct and
fulfil the objectives of socialism with respect to employment,
saving, increase in productivity and the redistribution of income.</P>
<P>It is therefore necessary to widen the scope of public ownership
and give it a new outlook. The expropriation of the most important
means of production will permit the attainment of the degree of
cohesion in this public machinery indispensable for the realisation
of the great national objectives. Hence one of the general criteria
for the definition of the area of public ownership is the need to
conceive this as a single, integrated whole, able to realise all its
potentialities in a short or medium term.</P>
<P>This implies an urgent need to set up a planning system which
devotes the economic surplus to the different productive assignments.
This year we have begun to set up such a system, creating advisory
bodies such as the National and Regional Development Councils. The
Annual Plan for 1971 has been laid down and for the rest of the year,
the planning organisations will work out the national economic plan
for 1971-76. It is our intention that no investment project shall be
carried forward unless it is included in these centrally approved
Government plans. In this manner, we shall put an end to
improvisation and begin to organise socialist planning in agreement
with the Popular Unity programme. The existence of socialised
ownership requires, by definition, a planning method which is both
capable and effective and which is endowed with sufficient
institutional power.</P>
<P>The advantages of socialism are not spectacularly displayed in the
first stages of construction. But the creation of a real morality of
work and the political mobilisation of the proletariat not only
around the government but also around the means of production will
overcome the obstacles.</P>
<P>The establishment of the area of public ownership does not mean
the creation of a State capitalism, but the true beginning of a
socialist structure. The sector of public ownership will be directed
jointly by the workers and by representatives of the State, as the
uniting link between each enterprise and the whole of the national
economy. It will not be inefficient bureaucratic enterprises but
highly productive units which will lead the country's development and
confer a new dimension on labour relations.</P>
<P>Our transitional regime does not consider the existence of the
market as the only regulator of the economic process. Planning will
be the main guide for the productive processes. Some will believe
that there are other ways. But the formation of workers' enterprises
integrated into the liberal market would mean dressing up
wage-earners as so-called capitalists and pursuing a method which is
a historical failure.</P>
<P>The supremacy of social ownership implies holding back and
utilising the surplus that has been produced. It is therefore
necessary to guarantee that the financial sector and a large part of
the distributive sector be included in the area of public ownership.
In short, we have to control the productive and financial processes
and also, to some extent, the trade sector.</P>
<P>We have to strengthen the area of social ownership, pouring the
power of the State, expressed in its economic policy, into this task
- our credit policy, our fiscal, monetary and wage policies, our
scientific and technological policies, our trade policy, must all be
subordinated to the needs of socialist accumulation, that is to say,
the interests of the workers.</P>
<P>Simultaneously, we must help the small and medium-sized
industrialists, shopkeepers and farmers, who have for many years
belonged to a sector exploited by the big monopolies, to make their
contribution. Our economic policy guarantees them a fair deal. There
will be no more financial exploitation, and the large-scale buyer's
extortion from those who sell on a small scale will end. The small
and medium-sized industries will play an active part in the new
economy. Within a more rationally organised machinery which is
directed towards production for the great majority of the nation,
they will appreciate the support of the public sector. The limits of
the private, mixed and public sectors will be precisely drawn.</P>
<P>We are facing an option for change unique in economic history. No
country has achieved an acceptable economic development without huge
sacrifices. We do not pretend to have discovered the recipe for
making economic progress and achieving a fairer social system without
cost. We are not offering to build overnight a socialised economy
with fair distribution of income, with monetary stability and full
employment, with high levels of productivity. On the other hand, we
are offering to build that society at the least possible social cost
imaginable in our circumstances. Socialism is not a free gift which
people happen to find in their path. Neither is the liberation that
accompanies it. Attaining it means postponing some present
possibilities in exchange for founding a more humane, richer and more
just society for the future.</P>
<P><a name="Our_foreign_policy"></a></P>
<h3>Our foreign policy</h3>
<P>The same principles which inform our internal policy inform the
foreign policy of the country. In agreement with the United Nations
Charter, our country resolutely supports non-intervention in the
internal affairs of nations, juridical equality between them, and
respect for their sovereignty and for the exercise of their right to
self-determination.</P>
<P>My Government's foreign policy is directed both bilaterally and
multilaterally towards the consolidation of peace and towards
international cooperation. As a result, Chile has extended its
diplomatic relations to new countries. Our first decision, in
obedience to the wish of the majority of Chilean people, was to
re-establish relations with Cuba, upon which unjust sanctions have
been imposed. We have also established diplomatic and economic
relations with China, Nigeria, and the German Democratic Republic. We
have established commercial relations with the Democratic Republics
of Korea and North Vietnam, and within the Latin American sphere we
have supported the reduction of arms before the Organisation of
American States.</P>
<P>Chile collaborated in the Declaration of the Principles of
International Law for Friendship and Cooperation Between Nations,
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at the end of
last year. We have also supported a programme of action to apply the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Nations and
Peoples, and we have taken part in the formulation of the
international strategy for the Second Decade of the United Nations
Development Programme.</P>
<P>Our fight against under-development and against dependence on
foreign hegemonies gives Chile a community of interests with the
peoples of Africa and Asia. For this reason the Popular Government
has decided to participate actively in the group of so-called
unaligned nations and to take a determined part in their
deliberations and agreements. Our concept of the universal scope of
the United Nations leads us to vote in favour of the legitimate
rights of the Chinese People's Republic. Our respect for the
independence of all countries requires us to condemn the Vietnam war
and its extension into Laos and Cambodia.</P>
<P>Within the general lines of this policy, we are collaborating in
the United Nations Commission for Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the
3rd World conference of which will take place in Santiago in April
1972. Furthermore, I have the honour to inform you that I have
received repeated invitations to visit countries of this and other
continents. I have thanked these nations for their courtesy in the
name of Chile.</P>
<P>It is the purpose of this Government to maintain friendly and
cooperative relations with the United States. We have persevered in
creating the conditions for making our position understood in order
to avoid the outbreak of conflict and to prevent inessential
questions from hindering this purpose and making it difficult to
negotiate the friendly settlement of any problems that might arise.
We believe that this realistic and objective course of action will be
respected by the people and Government of the United States.</P>
<P>We have raised our voice as a sovereign people respected by all
nations, and with the dignity of those who speak in the name of a
worthy country. This we have done in the Economic Commission for
Latin America (ECLA) and the Inter-American Committee for the
Alliance for Progress (CIAP), and in all the special meetings where
our representatives have expressed our thinking.</P>
<P>We have spoken repeatedly of the deep crisis which the
inter-American system and its representative body, the Organisation
of American States (OAS), are passing through. The said system is
based upon a supposed equality among its members when in fact there
is absolute inequality, when the marked imbalance in favour of the
United States protects the interests of the most powerful and
prejudices those of the weaker nations. This takes place in a global
context of dependence whose negative effects are evident at all
levels. Thus the present dollar crisis, which had its origin in the
internal and foreign policy of the United States, threatens to injure
all the industrial capitalist countries. But it will have even more
harmful repercussions upon the Latin American economies to the extent
that it reduces our monetary reserves, diminishes our credit and
restricts trade relations.</P>
<P>We also insist that the multilateral character of international
financial organisations must be maintained free of all political
pressures.</P>
<P>The member countries of these institutions cannot have their
rights questioned because of the form of government they have chosen.
And the international financial organisations cannot act on behalf of
powerful countries against the weak. To use direct or hidden pressure
in order to hinder the financing of technically suitable projects is
to alter the declared aims of these organisations and represents a
perverse way of interfering in the internal affairs of those
countries in defiance of their needs.</P>
<P>Our efforts to broaden and strengthen all kinds of relations with
the countries of Western Europe have been greeted with definite
interest on their part, an interest which has already had real
results.</P>
<P>In the increase in exchange and collaboration with the socialist
countries my Government sees a suitable method of protecting our
interests and stimulating the economy, technology, science and
culture as a means of serving the working class of the entire world.</P>
<P>Latin America is in an abject state which none of its countries
have been able to change by the traditional and ineffective means.</P>
<P>For some time, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and Chile have
proposed replacing the old formulas by new ones which, through
regional integration, will permit the harmonious development of our
resources in favour of our common objectives. The Andean Pact (signed
in 1969) is an exemplary undertaking into which the Popular Unity
Government is putting in all its efforts. We have demonstrated as
much both in Lima and Bogota.</P>
<P>My Government attaches special importance to maintaining the best
possible relations with the sister nations of the continent. It is
our fundamental aim to strengthen all the links which will increase
our continued friendship with the Argentine Republic, eliminating the
obstacles which stand in the way of realising this objective. The
anomalous state of our relations with the republic of Bolivia
conflicts with the aims of both peoples, and for this reason we shall
do everything in our power to restore them to normal.</P>
<P><a name="The_leading_role_of_the_workers"></a></P>
<h3>The leading role of the workers</h3>
<P>Everything we have discussed in the political, economic, cultural,
and international fields represents the task of a whole nation, not
that of one man or one government.</P>
<P>Between the months of November and February, the number of workers
who have been obliged to go on strike has decreased from 170000 to
76000. The Popular Government's identification with the workers who
share its successes and setbacks has made disputes unnecessary which
were formerly inevitable. This year there have been no strikes in the
coal, nitrate, copper, iron and textiles industries, the health
services, education or railroads. In other words, there have been no
strikes in those sectors which are vital to the nation's progress.</P>
<P>I should like to emphasise that for the first time in Chile,
voluntary work has been introduced on a permanent basis in some state
enterprises. And also, that for the first time it is being carried on
in all areas of national life and on a massive scale from Arica to
the Straits of Magellan. Soldiers, priests, students, workers,
members of the professions and shopkeepers, old and young, are
participating freely, spontaneously and in their own time in the
common tasks. It is a much more creative development than working for
profit. And it is an eloquent reply to those who, inside and outside
Chile, would like to believe things that have never happened and
never will. In this country there is and there will be a government
which knows what methods to apply and when to apply them. As
President, I assume responsibility for this.</P>
<P>The great achievements that lie before us will depend on the
responsible and determined identification of the worker with his own
real interests, which are more far-reaching than the small or big
problems of this day, this month or this year. In the solidarity of
the workers and their political representative, the Popular
Government, we have an invincible instrument.</P>
<P>Those who live by their work have in their hands today the
political direction of the State. It is a supreme responsibility. The
building of the new social regime is based on the people, who are its
protagonist and its judge. It is up to the State to guide, organise,
and direct, but never to replace the will of the workers. In the
economic as well as in the political field, the workers must retain
the right to decide. To attain this means the triumph of the
Revolution.</P>
<P>The people are fighting for this goal. They are fighting with the
legitimacy that comes from respecting democratic values - with the
assurance given by our programme - with the strength of being the
majority - with the passion of the revolutionary.</P>
<P>We shall overcome.</P>
