<h2>Salvador Allende</h2>
<blockquote>
  <H1>Last Words to the Nation</H1>
</blockquote>
<P class="information">This speech was delivered at 9:10 am on September 11, 1973, in the midst
on an ultimately successful US-sponsored coup d'etat against the democratically-elected government.&nbsp; Barricaded inside La Moneda, the
presidential palace, President Allende gave his life defending Chilean
democracy. Translation by Yoshie Furuhashi. Translation first appeared in <a href="http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2006/allende110906.html">MRzine here</a>.</P>

<P>My friends,</P>
<P>Surely this will be the last opportunity for me to address you.
The Air Force has bombed the towers of <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Radio
Portales and Radio Corporación</font>.</P>
<P>My words do not have bitterness but disappointment. May they be a
moral punishment for those who have betrayed their oath: soldiers of
Chile, titular commanders in chief, Admiral Merino, who has
designated himself Commander of the Navy, and Mr. Mendoza, the
despicable general who only yesterday pledged his fidelity and
loyalty to the Government, and who also has appointed himself Chief
of the Carabineros [national police].</P>
<P>Given these facts, the only thing left for me is to say to
workers: I am not going to resign!&nbsp;</P>
<P> Placed in a historic transition, I
will pay for loyalty to the people with my life. And I say to them
that I am certain that the seed which we have planted in the good
conscience of thousands and thousands of Chileans will not be
shriveled forever.</P>
<P>They have strength and will be able to dominate us, but social
processes can be arrested neither by crime nor force. History is
ours, and people make history.</P>
<P>Workers of my country: I want to thank you for the loyalty that
you always had, the confidence that you deposited in a man who was
only an interpreter of great yearnings for justice, who gave his word
that he would respect the Constitution and the law and did just that.
At this definitive moment, the last moment when I can address you, I
wish you to take advantage of the lesson: foreign capital,
imperialism, together with the reaction, created the climate in which
the Armed Forces broke their tradition, the tradition taught by
General Schneider and reaffirmed by Commander Araya, victims of the
same social sector which will today be in their homes hoping, with foreign assistance, to
retake power to continue defending their profits and their
privileges.</P>
<P>I address, above all, the modest woman of our land, the <i>
campesina</i> who believed in us, the worker who labored more, the mother who knew our concern for
children. I address professionals of Chile, patriotic professionals, those who
days ago continued working against the sedition sponsored by
professional associations, class-based associations that also defended
the advantages which a capitalist society grants to a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>I address the youth, those who
sang and gave us their joy and their spirit of struggle. I address
the man of Chile, the worker, the farmer, the intellectual, those who
will be persecuted, because in our country fascism has been already
present for many hours -- in terrorist attacks, blowing up the
bridges, cutting the railroad tracks, destroying the oil and gas
pipelines, in the face of the silence of those who had the obligation
to protect them.&nbsp; They were committed. History will judge them.</P>
<P>Surely Radio Magallanes will be silenced, and the calm metal
instrument of my voice will no longer reach you. It does not matter.
You will continue hearing it. I will always be next to you. At least
my memory will be that of a man of dignity who was loyal to [<i>inaudible</i>]
the workers.</P>
<P>The people must defend themselves, but they must not sacrifice
themselves. The people must not let themselves be destroyed or
riddled with bullets, but they cannot be humiliated either.</P>
<P>Workers of my country, I have faith in Chile and its destiny.
Other men will overcome this dark and bitter moment when treason
seeks to prevail. Go forward knowing that, sooner rather than later, the great avenues
will open again where free men will walk to build a better society.</P>
<P>Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers!</P>
<P>These are my last words, and I am certain that my sacrifice will
not be in vain, I am certain that, at the very least, it will be a
moral lesson that will punish felony, cowardice, and treason.</P>
<P>Santiago de Chile, 11 September 1973</P>
