<hr>

<p class="fst">From a very early age, perhaps the age of five or six, I knew 
that when I grew up I should be a writer. Between the ages of about seventeen 
and twenty-four I tried to abandon this idea, but I did so with the 
consciousness that I was outraging my true nature and that sooner or later I 
should have to settle down and write books.</p>

<p class="fst">I was the middle child of three, but there was a gap of five 
years on either side, and I barely saw my father before I was eight. For this 
and other reasons I was somewhat lonely, and I soon developed disagreeable 
mannerisms which made me unpopular throughout my schooldays. I had the lonely 
child&#8217;s habit of making up stories and holding conversations with imaginary 
persons, and I think from the very start my literary ambitions were mixed up 
with the feeling of being isolated and undervalued. I knew that I had a facility 
with words and a power of facing unpleasant facts, and I felt that this created 
a sort of private world in which I could get my own back for my failure in 
everyday life. Nevertheless the volume of serious&#8212;i.e., seriously 
intended&#8212;writing which I produced all through my childhood and boyhood would not 
amount to half a dozen pages. I wrote my first poem at the age of four or five, 
my mother taking it down to dictation. I cannot remember anything about it 
except that it was about a tiger and the tiger had &#8220;chair-like teeth&#8221;&#8212;a good 
enough phrase, but I fancy the poem was a plagiarism of Blake&#8217;s &#8220;Tiger, Tiger.&#8221; 
At eleven, when the war of 1914-18 broke out, I wrote a patriotic poem which was 
printed in the local newspaper, as was another, two years later, on the death of 
Kitchener. From time to time, when I was a bit older, I wrote bad and usually 
unfinished &#8220;nature poems&#8221; in the Georgian style. I also, about twice, attempted 
a short story which was a ghastly failure. That was the total of the would-be 
serious work that I actually set down on paper during all those years.</p>

<p class="fst">However, throughout this time I did in a sense engage in literary 
activities. To begin with there was the made-to-order stuff which I produced 
quickly, easily and without much pleasure to myself . Apart from school work, I 
wrote <i>vers d&#8217;occasion,</i> semi-comic poems which I could turn out at what 
now seems to me astonishing speed&#8212;at fourteen I wrote a whole rhyming play, in 
imitation of Aristophanes, in about a week&#8212;and helped to edit school magazines, 
both printed and in manuscript. These magazines were the most pitiful burlesque 
stuff that you could imagine, and I took far less trouble with them than I now 
would with the cheapest journalism. But side by side with all this, for fifteen 
years or more, I was carrying out a literary exercise of a quite different kind: 
this was the making up of a continuous &#8220;story&#8221; about myself, a sort of diary 
existing only in the mind. I believe this is a common habit of children and 
adolescents. As a very small child I used to imagine that I was, say, Robin 
Hood, and picture myself as the hero of thrilling adventures, but quite soon my 
&#8220;story&#8221; ceased to be narcissistic in a crude way and became more and more a mere 
description of what I was doing and the things I saw. For minutes at a time this 
kind of thing would be running through my head: &#8220;He pushed the door open and 
entered the room. A yellow beam of sunlight, filtering through the muslin 
curtains, slanted on to the table, where a matchbox, half open, lay beside the 
inkpot. With his right hand in his pocket he moved across to the window. Down in 
the street a tortoiseshell cat was chasing a dead leaf,&#8221; etc. etc. This habit 
continued till I was about twenty-five, right through my non-literary years. 
Although I had to search, and did search, for the right words, I seemed to be 
making this descriptive effort almost against my will, under a kind of 
compulsion from outside. The &#8220;story&#8221; must, I suppose, have reflected the styles 
of the various writers I admired at different ages, but so far as I remember it 
always had the same meticulous descriptive quality.</p>

<p class="fst">When I was about sixteen I suddenly discovered the joy of mere 
words, i.e., the sounds and associations of words. The lines from <i>Paradise 
Lost,</i></p>

<p class="indentb"><i>So hee with difficulty and labour hard</i><br>

<i>Moved on: with difficulty and labour hee.</i></p>

<p class="fst">which do not now seem to me so very wonderful, sent shivers down 
my backbone; and the spelling &#8220;hee&#8221; for &#8220;he&#8221; was an added pleasure. As for the 
need to describe things, I knew all about it already. So it is clear what kind 
of books I wanted to write, in so far as I could be said to want to write books 
at that time. I wanted to write enormous naturalistic novels with unhappy 
endings, full of detailed descriptions and arresting similes, and also full of 
purple passages in which words were used partly for the sake of their sound. And 
in fact my first completed novel, <i>Burmese Days,</i> which I wrote when I was 
thirty but projected much earlier, is rather that kind of book.</p>

<p class="fst">I give all this background information because I do not think one 
can assess a writer&#8217;s motives without knowing something of his early 
development. His subject matter will be determined by the age he lives in&#8212;at 
least this is true in tumultuous, revolutionary ages like our own&#8212;but before he 
ever begins to write he will have acquired an emotional attitude from which he 
will never completely escape. It is his job, no doubt, to discipline his 
temperament and avoid getting stuck at some immature stage, or in some perverse 
mood: but if he escapes from his early influences altogether, he will have 
killed his impulse to write. Putting aside the need to earn a living, I think 
there are four great motives for writing, at any rate for writing prose. They 
exist in different degrees in every writer, and in any one writer the 
proportions will vary from time to time, according to the atmosphere in which he 
is living. They are:</p>

<p class="fst">1. Sheer egoism. Desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be 
remembered after death, to get your own back on grown-ups who snubbed you in 
childhood, etc. etc. It is humbug to pretend that this is not a motive, a strong 
one. Writers share this characteristic with scientists, artists, politicians, 
lawyers, soldiers, successful businessmen&#8212; in short, with the whole top crust of 
humanity. The great mass of human beings are not acutely selfish. After the age 
of about thirty they abandon individual ambition&#8212;in many cases, indeed, they 
almost abandon the sense of being individuals at all&#8212;and live chiefly for 
others, or are simply smothered under drudgery. But there is also the minority 
of gifted, wilful people who are determined to live their own lives to the end, 
and writers belong in this class. Serious writers, I should say, are on the 
whole more vain and self-centered than journalists, though less interested in 
money.</p>

<p class="fst">2. Aesthetic enthusiasm. Perception of beauty in the external 
world, or, on the other hand, in words and their right arrangement. Pleasure in 
the impact of one sound on another, in the firmness of good prose or the rhythm 
of a good story. Desire to share an experience which one feels is valuable and 
ought not to be missed. The aesthetic motive is very feeble in a lot of writers, 
but even a pamphleteer or a writer of textbooks will have pet words and phrases 
which appeal to him for non-utilitarian reasons; or he may feel strongly about 
typography, width of margins, etc. Above the level of a railway guide, no book 
is quite free from aesthetic considerations.</p>

<p class="fst">3. Historical impulse. Desire to see things as they are, to find 
out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity.</p>

<p class="fst">4. Political purpose&#8212;using the word &#8220;political&#8221; in the widest 
possible sense. Desire to push the world in a certain direction, to alter other 
people&#8217;s idea of the kind of society that they should strive after. Once again, 
no book is genuinely free from political bias. The opinion that art should have 
nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude.</p>

<p class="fst">It can be seen how these various impulses must war against one 10 
another, and how they must fluctuate from person to person and from time to 
time. By nature&#8212;taking your &#8220;nature&#8221; to be the state you have attained when you 
are first adult&#8212;I am a person in whom the first three motives would outweigh the 
fourth. In a peaceful age I might have written ornate or merely descriptive 
books, and might have remained almost unaware of my political loyalties. As it 
is I have been forced into becoming a sort of pamphleteer. First I spent five 
years in an unsuitable profession (the Indian Imperial Police, in Burma), and 
then I underwent poverty and the sense of failure. This increased my natural 
hatred of authority and made me for the first time fully aware of the existence 
of the working classes, and the job in Burma had given me some understanding of 
the nature of imperialism: but these experiences were not enough to give me an 
accurate political orientation. Then came Hitler, the Spanish civil war, etc. By 
the end of 1935 I had still failed to reach a firm decision. I remember a little 
poem that I wrote at that date, expressing my dilemma:</p>

<p class="indentb"><i>A happy vicar I might have been</i><br>
<i>Two hundred years ago,</i><br>
<i>To preach upon eternal doom</i><br>
<i>And watch my walnuts grow;</i></p>

<p class="indentb"><i>But born, alas, in an evil time,</i><br>
<i>I missed that pleasant haven,</i><br>
<i>For the hair has grown on my upper lip</i><br>
<i>And the clergy are all clean-shaven.</i></p>

<p class="indentb"><i>And later still the times were good,</i><br>
<i>We were so easy to please,</i><br>
<i>We rocked our troubled thoughts to sleep</i><br>
<i>On the bosoms of the trees.</i></p>

<p class="indentb"><i>All ignorant we dared to own</i><br>
<i>The joys we now dissemble;</i><br>
<i>The greenfinch on the apple bough</i><br>
<i>Could make my enemies tremble.</i></p>

<p class="indentb"><i>But girls&#8217; bellies and apricots,</i><br>
<i>Roach in a shaded stream.</i><br>
<i>Horses, ducks in flight at dawn,</i><br>
<i>All these are a dream.</i></p>

<p class="indentb"><i>It is forbidden to dream again;</i><br>
<i>We maim our joys or hide them;</i><br>
<i>Horses are made of chromium steel</i><br>
<i>And little fat men shall ride them.</i></p>

<p class="indentb"><i>I am the worm who never turned,</i><br>
<i>The eunuch without a harem;</i><br>
<i>Between the priest and the commissar</i><br>
<i>I walk like Eugene Aram;</i></p>

<p class="indentb"><i>And the commissar is telling my fortune</i><br>
<i>While the radio plays,</i><br>
<i>But the priest has promised an Austin Seven.</i><br>
<i>For Duggie always pays.</i></p>

<p class="indentb"><i>I dreamed I dwelt in marble halls,</i><br>
<i>And woke to find it true;</i><br>
<i>I wasn&#8217;t born for an age like this;</i><br>
<i>Was Smith? Was Jones? Were you?</i></p>

<p class="fst">The Spanish war and other events in 1936-37 turned the scale and 
thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written 
since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, <i>against</i> 
totalitarianism and <i>for</i> democratic Socialism, as I understand it. It 
seems to me nonsense in a period like our own, to think that one can avoid 
writing of such subjects. Everyone writes of them in one guise or another. It is 
simply a question of which side one takes and what approach one follows. And the 
more one is conscious of one&#8217;s political bias, the more chance one has of acting 
politically without sacrificing one&#8217;s aesthetic and intellectual integrity.</p>

<p class="fst">What I have most wanted to do throughout the past ten years is to 
make political writing into an art. My starting point is always a feeling of 
partisanship, a sense of injustice. When I sit down to write a book, I do not 
say to myself, &#8220;I am going to produce a work of art.&#8221; I write it because there 
is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, 
and my initial concern is to get a hearing. But I could not do the work of 
writing a book, or even a long magazine article, if it were not also an 
aesthetic experience. Anyone who cares to examine my work will see that even 
when it is downright propaganda it contains much that a full-time politician 
would consider irrelevant. I am not able, and I do not want, completely to 
abandon the world-view that I acquired in childhood. So long as I remain alive 
and well I shall continue to feel strongly about prose style, to love the 
surface of the earth, and to take pleasure in solid objects and scraps of 
useless information. It is no use trying to suppress that side of myself. The 
job is to reconcile my ingrained likes and dislikes with the essentially public, 
non-individual activities that this age forces on all of us.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not easy. It raises problems of construction and language, 
and it raises in a new way the problem of truthfulness. Let me give just one 
example of the cruder kind of difficulty that arises. My book about the Spanish 
civil war, <i>Homage to Catalonia,</i> is, of course, a frankly political book, 
but in the main it is written with a certain detachment and regard for form. I 
did try very hard in it to tell the whole truth without violating my literary 
instincts. But among other things it contains a long chapter, full of newspaper 
quotations and the like, defending the Trotskyists who were accused of plotting 
with Franco. Clearly such a chapter, which after a year or two would lose its 
interest for any ordinary reader, must ruin the book. A critic whom I respect 
read me a lecture about it. &#8220;Why did you put in all that stuff?&#8221; he said. 
&#8220;You&#8217;ve turned what might have been a good book into journalism.&#8221; What he said 
was true, but I could not have done otherwise. I happened to know, what very few 
people in England have been allowed to know, that innocent men were being 
falsely accused. If I had not been angry about that I should never have written 
the book.</p>

<p class="fst">In one form or another this problem comes up again. The problem 
of language is subtler and would take too long to discuss. I will only say that 
of late years I have tried to write less picturesquely and more exactly. In any 
case I find that by the time you have perfected any style of writing, you have 
always outgrown it. <i>Animal Farm</i> was the first book in which I tried, with 
full consciousness of what I was doing, to fuse political purpose and artistic 
purpose into one whole. I have not written a novel for seven years, but I hope 
to write another fairly soon. It is bound to be a failure, every book is a 
failure, but I know with some clarity what kind of book I want to write.</p>

<p class="fst">Looking back through the last page or two, I see that I have made 
it appear as though my motives in writing were wholly public-spirited. I don&#8217;t 
want to leave that as the final impression. All writers are vain, selfish and 
lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a 
book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful 
illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by 
some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand. For all one knows that 
demon is simply the same instinct that makes a baby squall for attention. And 
yet it is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly 
struggles to efface one&#8217;s own personality. Good prose is like a window pane. I 
cannot say with certainty which of my motives are the strongest, but I know 
which of them deserve to be followed. And looking back through my work, I see 
that it is invariably where I lacked a <i>political</i> purpose that I wrote 
lifeless books and was betrayed into purple passages, sentences without meaning, 
decorative adjectives and humbug generally.</p>
