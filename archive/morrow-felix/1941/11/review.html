<hr />
<p class="fst">MINNEAPOLIS, Nov. 30. &ndash; As we sit here, waiting
for the jury to come in with its verdict &ndash; I am writing at
8:30&nbsp;p.m., 32 and a half hours after the jury was sent out &ndash;
it is in order to review the last part of the trial.</p>

<p>Readers of <B>The Militant</B> may have been puzzled,
last week, to read, in one and the same issue, the story of the
testimony of the first defense witness, James P. Cannon, and a
bulletin announcing that the defense had closed its case. Puzzling,
perhaps, especially in view of the fact that for weeks <B>The
Militant</B> had been filled with a day-to-day ac count of the
prosecution&rsquo;s lengthy presentation of its case.</p>

<p>The explanation is simple. The prosecution had taken
three full weeks for its side &ndash; fifteen court days. The defense
then took only four court days to present its side, that is, just a
little more than one-fourth of the time taken by the prosecution.</p>

<p>Of those four days, which began Tuesday afternoon,
Nov. 18. the first defense witness, Jim Cannon, was on the witness
stand, including cross-examination, for just a little less than two
whole days. His testimony is being published verbatim, beginning with
last week&rsquo;s issue of <B>The Militant</B>.</p>

<p>Cannon was on the stand Tuesday afternoon, all day
Wednesday, and (Thursday was the Thanksgiving holiday) part of Friday
morning.</p>

<p>He was followed to the stand by six Minneapolis truck
drivers who had been members of the Union Defense Guard here in 1938
and 1939. The most solid type of workers, they made a striking
contrast to the scum used by the government as witnesses. The six,
testifying to the formation of the Union Defense Guard to meet the
Silver Shirt danger, and the fact that the guard ceased functioning
when the fascist danger died down, effectively established that the
guard was formed for that purpose and no other. This punctured the
prosecution contention that the guard had been designed to overthrow
the government.</p>

<p>The truck drivers were followed to the stand by two
University of Minnesota students, who testified on what they had
heard defendant Grace Carlson say in a speech at the University.
Their testimony refuted the contention of a government witness that
Grace Carlson had advocated the use of force and violence in that
speech.</p>

<p>In the afternoon defendant V.R. Dunne, a Local
544-CIO organizer and leading member of the SWP, took the stand. He
traced the story of the rise and growth of Local 544, defending the
glorious record of that famous union against the slanders and
innuendos of the prosecution. He was still on the stand when Friday&rsquo;s
court session ended.</p>
