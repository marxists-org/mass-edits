<hr />
<p class="fst">For the first time in a long, long time, the leadership of the
Communist Party has published a general document on its trade union
policy. <I>Labor Has Moved Forward</I> is its title, and it takes a
full page in the Friday, May 9, <B>Daily Worker</B>. It expresses a
trade union policy which is opportunist to the core, a policy which
can only lead the workers to defeat.</P>
<P>The recent strike wave has proved once again that the CIO, based
on the heavy industries, comprises the most militant and the most
strategically-important strata of the American working class. Ninety
per cent of the recent strikes, and consequently of the gains in
wages and working conditions, were the achievement of the CIO unions.
In these strikes the workers demonstrated that, though they are. for
the &ldquo;defense&rdquo; and aid-Britain program &ndash; their
anti-fascist sentiments are being manipulated by Roosevelt for
imperialist purposes &ndash; they are also more than ever determined
to wrest better wages and working conditions from the
war-profiteering capitalists.</P>
<P>All this was shown by the CIO strikes. But those strikes also
revealed a profound difference between the CIO top leadership and the
rank and file. While the strikers showed invincible determination on
the picket lines, the top leaders were weakening in the negotiations.
Much that was won on the picket line was Surrendered at the
conference table.</P>
<P>Flagrant examples were the settlements in the Bethlehem and Ford
strikes, where the workers were sent back to work without a union
contract. Why did the 1937 strikes against General Motors and
Chrysler win settlement by union contract, and the 1941 strikes
against Ford and Bethlehem did not? There is only one answer: the top
CIO leadership buckled under government pressure and sent the men
back to work for a fraction of what they had already won on the
picket line.</P>
<P>It should be clear, then, that unless the workers learn from the
shortcomings of the recent strike settlements, these shortcomings are
likely to be repeated &ndash; and in worse form &ndash; during the
next strike wave.</P>
<H4>The Stalinist Conspiracy of Silence</H4>
<p class="fst">The workers cannot learn this from the Communist Party&rsquo;s
document on trade union policy. On the contrary, the Stalinist
document COVERS UP the false policy of the top leadership of the CIO.</P>
<P>And from this treacherous silence it follows that the Stalinist
document does not raise the various demands which the Socialist
Workers Party has raised, to remedy the defects in the course of the
CIO. The Stalinist document does not demand that trade union
officials resign from all posts in the government, including the OPM
and the National Mediation Board. Nor does it call for organizing
Union Defense Guards to protect the, picket lines and union halls
against &ldquo;law and order committees&rdquo; and all other
anti-labor bands. Nor does it call for an immediate halt to all acts
of hostility between the AFL and CIO which serve the bosses&rsquo;
strikebreaking. And it is silent about the immediate need to build an
Independent Labor Party.</P>
<P>It is silent on these and other burning questions because the
Stalinist trade union policy is based at present on a whitewash of
John L. Lewis. The <B>Daily Worker</B> document is one long song of
praise to Lewis. It takes lots of whitewash to present John L. Lewis
as an unblemished lamb. But that is all in the day&rsquo;s work to
those who tried to whitewash even the Moscow trials! It takes lies
and concealment? These are the daily tools of the <B>Daily Worker</B>.</P>
<P>Let us cite a few examples:</P>
<p class="fst">1. The document warns against &ldquo;the different &lsquo;defense
plans,&rsquo; whether put forward by Hillman or Murray.&rdquo;
Correct. BUT JOHN L. LEWIS HAS ENDORSED MURRAY&rsquo;S PLAN. In the
May 5th <B>CIO News</B> there appears the text of a speech by John L.
Lewis. In it Lewis says:</P>
<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;Philip Murray has offered government a plan ...
The concentration of war orders is the bottleneck which restricts
American production for defense ... Philip Murray&rsquo;s plan would
have avoided that, and would have curbed the rapacity of industrial
leaders.&rdquo;</I></p>
<p class="fst">In these unambiguous terms, Lewis endorsed Murray&rsquo;s plan for
&ldquo;industry councils&rdquo; composed of government, employer and
labor representatives &ndash; a typical example of the government
boards used to subordinate the workers to their class enemies. That
Lewis proposed this is, however, not even hinted at in the Stalinist
document!<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Lewis Follows in Bevin&rsquo;s Footsteps</H4>
<p class="fst">2. Nor did John L. Lewis stop with endorsing Murray&rsquo;s
reactionary plan. Nor did he stop with saying that <i>&ldquo;Mr.
Murray will be proud to supply some real representatives&rdquo;</I>
to sit in the OPM, NDAC and other of the present governmental boards.
Lewis went on to praise the British Labor Party&rsquo;s policy of
partnership with the bosses in government and to propose the same
thing for this country:</P>
<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;The difference between labor in the United
States and Britain is that in England today labor is part of the
government; it sits in policy-making positions and has a voice in
formulating policies. In the United States, labor is not represented.
It has no place in the government or in the cabinet. It has no
adequate representation in the OPM or the NDAC or the War
Department.&rdquo;</I> (John L. Lewis speech, <B>CIO News</B>, May 5,
1941)</p>
<p class="fst">In short, John L. Lewis&rsquo; policy is that of Bevin and the
other British Labor Party leaders, a policy which the <B>Daily Worker</B>
has correctly termed a betrayal of labor. But the <B>Daily Worker</B>
conceals from its readers and the Communist Party members, that
Bevin&rsquo;s policy is also that of John L. Lewis.</P>
<p class="fst">3. By a skilful half-truth, the Stalinist document pictures John
L. Lewis as an irreconcilable opponent of the National Mediation
Board. It writes of <i>&ldquo;the Mediation Board which, as John L.
Lewis so well pointed out, had its own formula for breaking strikes.&rdquo;</I>
The kernel of truth in this statement is that Lewis did correctly
denounce&rdquo; one of the Board&rsquo;s formulas: that calling on
strikers to go back to work before mediation.</P>
<P>But Lewis did <I>not</I> characterize the Board as a
strikebreaking institution. Lewis did <I>not</I> oppose the entry of
CIO representatives in to the Board. On the contrary, Murray and
Kennedy, Lewis&rsquo; lieutenants, went into the Board with the
silent consent of Lewis. These facts about Lewis the <B>Daily Worker</B>
seeks to cover up by its half-truth about his one specific criticism
of the Mediation Board. And because Lewis backs Murray and Kennedy&rsquo;s
entry into the board, the Stalinist leaders, while making a
perfunctory criticism of that entry, do not demand that CIO leaders
resign from the board. Thereby the Stalinists aid in perpetuating
union fig-leaves on government strikebreaking weapons.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>The Bethlehem and Ford Strikes</H4>
<p class="fst">4. The <B>Daily Worker</B> says nothing about the notorious, fact
that the picket lines at the Bethlehem plants in Buffalo and
Bethlehem, Pa., were left to shift for themselves, while the top
leaders hurried off to settle as quickly as possible and without
getting a union contract. Why weren&rsquo;t those picket lines better
organized? Why no union contracts? The <B>Daily Worker</B> is silent
because those responsible were John L. Lewis&rsquo; lieutenants and
associates.</P>
<p class="fst">5. Even more flagrant was the behavior of the top leaders in the
Ford strike. Only after the strike, precipitated by the workers in
the plant, had developed into a sit-down and the frightened top
leaders wanted to get the workers out of the plants, did the leaders
finally make the strike official. Nor could the leaders claim credit
for the brilliant strategy which ensured the success of the strike &ndash;
the mass auto barricades that outwitted Ford&rsquo;s &ldquo;service
department.&rdquo; The only role the top leaders played was in
getting- the workers back to work without a union contract. Not a
word about this in the <B>Daily Worker</B> either at the time or in
its present document: because the leaders responsible for that were
John L. Lewis&rsquo; men.</P>
<p class="fst">6. &ldquo;One of the main weapons of the employers in stemming the
wage increase drive is the no-strike agreement of the kind which the
Hillmans and Freys are attempting to impose upon the shipyard workers
and which actually worsens existing conditions,&rdquo; says the
Stalinist document. True &ndash; as far as it goes. But on the East
Coast the CIO Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers is
a party to just such an agreement now in process of completion, the
<B>CIO News</B> has reported the developments without a word of
criticism, and the <B>Daily Worker</B> knows as well as we do&rsquo;
that the shipbuilding union leadership is close to John L. Lewis.</P>
<P>(Incidentally, the Stalinists&rsquo; own boy, National Maritime
Union President Joseph Curran, has proposed for maritime just such a
permanent board of governmental, employer and labor representatives
as is set up under the shipbuilding agreement &ndash; of course
without a word being said in the <B>Daily Worker</B>.)</P>
<p class="fst">7. The <B>Daily Worker</B> document correctly denounces the AFL
top leadership for its strikebreaking role in the Ford, International
Harvester and Allis-Chalmers strikes, where AFL charters issued to
company stooges gave anti-labor elements the pretext to condemn
&ldquo;jurisdictional strikes.&rdquo; The <B>Daily Worker</B> is,
however, silent about the fact that the same kind of scabby role has
been played by the CIO&rsquo;s &ldquo;Construction Workers Organizing
Committee&rdquo; headed by A.D. Lewis, John L.&rsquo;s brother and
lieutenant.</P>
<P>At Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, A.D. Lewis covered with a CIO
charter electricians working for a contractor who had refused to sign
a regular contract with the regular union in the trade &ndash; the
AFL&rsquo;s International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. An AFL
strike against this contractor was broken by government pressure
which, thanks to the CIO charter, was able to label the strikers
merely &ldquo;jurisdictional.&rdquo; This shameful incident was used
by the AFL leaders as a pretext to justify their scabbery at
International Harvester and elsewhere. Silent about John L. Lewis&rsquo;
role in this and a number of similar incidents in the construction
industry, the <B>Daily Worker</B> is unable to support the correct
slogan: An end to <I>all</I> acts of hostility between CIO and AFL &ndash;
whether committed by AFL or CIO leaders &ndash; which serve the
bosses&rsquo; strikebreaking.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>What Lewis&rsquo; Program Includes</H4>
<p class="fst">8. The <B>Daily Worker</B> document says: &ldquo;The movement for
wage increases must be developed everywhere. The issue is the Lewis
program of winning increases versus the Hillman program of
sacrifices.&rdquo; This half-truth, more vicious than an outright
lie, sums up the whole Stalinist trade union policy. It confronts the
workers with but two alternatives: Lewis or Hillman. As if the class
struggle consists merely of a choice between two men who, despite
considerable differences in their policies, nevertheless are both
irrevocably tied to a class-collaborationist outlook!</P>
<P>&ldquo;The Lewis program&rdquo; is also the program which includes
Lewis-Murray&rsquo;s &ldquo;defense&rdquo; plan and the &ldquo;demand&rdquo;
for &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; labor posts in the government; entry into
the National Mediation Board and the other governmental boards; the
poor settlements of the Ford and Bethlehem strikes, etc.</P>
<p class="fst">9. The Lewis program also includes plenty of red-baiting. Although
Lewis and Murray have taken the progressive step of defending Harry
Bridges against the attempt to deport him, they have <I>also</I>
instigated red-baiting attacks in the unions. Let the <B>Daily Worker</B>
dare to claim that the removal as &ldquo;Communists&rdquo; of local
union officials by the International Executive Board of the CIO
shipyard union was not done with the agreement of Lewis and Murray!
We dare the <B>Daily Worker</B> to assert that the puny James B.
Carey, president of the United Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine
Workers, a fifth-rate figure whom Lewis and Murray made national
secretary of the CIO, is conducting his red-baiting in the UE without
prior agreement with Lewis and Murray! In the Northwest, three of
John L. Lewis&rsquo; own machine men &ndash; Dalrymple and Francis,
CIO state directors of Oregon and Washington, and Adolph Germer,
Lewis&rsquo; appointee as director of organization of the
International Woodworkers &ndash; are going to any lengths, including
calling in the FBI against the &ldquo;reds&rdquo; &ndash; let the
<B>Daily Worker</B> tell us why Lewis and Murray haven&rsquo;t
stopped them. But the <B>Daily Worker</B> covers all this with
silence; it will not tell the truth about Lewis and his henchmen.</P>
<P>One could adduce dozens of other examples of the lies, half-truths
and concealment resorted to by the <B>Daily Worker</B> to whitewash
John L. Lewis. What has been already said, however, suffices to show
the CONSEQUENCES of this Stalinist fraud &ndash; whitewashing John L.
Lewis means, on the union floor and the picket line, policies which
rob the workers of the fruits of their victories.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Why the Stalinists Support Lewis</H4>
<p class="fst">Why do the Stalinists persist in supporting Lewis through thick
and thin? They even found progressive aspects in his support of
Willkie&rsquo;s election campaign. During 1935&ndash;1938, Stalinist
reasons for a bloc with Lewis were obvious enough. The Stalinists
were then for &ldquo;defense of the democracies by collective
security,&rdquo; were for &ldquo;defeat of Landon at all costs,&rdquo;
etc., and so was Lewis. But now the Lewis and Stalinist lines diverge
sharply. Lewis is for &ldquo;defense,&rdquo; &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;
posts in the government, gives silent consent to Murray&rsquo;s
aid-Britain policy, etc., all of which the Stalinists oppose.</P>
<P>He who looks in Lewis&rsquo; policies for an explanation of
Stalinist support of him is looking in the wrong place. The
Stalinists support him for the same reason that they support Batista,
Roosevelt&rsquo;s agent in Cuba, and Mexico President Camacho, who
has become completely subservient to Wall Street&rsquo;s program. It
is merely the method whereby the Stalinist apparatus seeks to hang on
in each of these countries during this period. Then, if and when
Stalin seeks to re-orient toward the &ldquo;democracies,&rdquo; his
hirelings will at that time have ready at hand a bass from which to
woo the &ldquo;democracies&rdquo; on behalf of Stalin. Not Lewis&rsquo;
policies, but the needs of Stalin&rsquo;s foreign policy explain the
Stalinist policy in the trade unions. That this policy causes untold
harm to the workers &ndash; that scarcely troubles the monster in the
Kremlin or his agents here. Deeply tragic, however, is the plight of
the many genuine militants who, deluded by the Stalinist bureaucracy,
serve as the unwitting vessels who transfer its deadly poison into
the veins of the American working class.</P>
