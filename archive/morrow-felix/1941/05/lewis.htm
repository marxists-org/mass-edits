<hr />
<p class="fst">Since the fiasco, of his campaign for the election of Wendell
Willkie, John L. Lewis&rsquo; future course has been defined not too
clearly. At the CIO convention last November where Philip Murray
replaced him as president, Lewis retrieved much of his standing in
the eyes of CIO workers by his leadership of the fight against the
Hillman proposal to make a capitulatory peace with the AFL
bureaucracy. Lewis rose a big notch higher in the opinion of these
workers when, during the miners&rsquo; strike, he condemned the
National Mediation Board for demanding that striker&rsquo;s go back
to work before the bosses agreed to settlements.</P>
<P>But what would be Lewis&rsquo; general program for the labor
movement for this period of war? Lewis made no move to indicate that
at the CIO convention. On the contrary, it was noticeable that he
carefully stood aside while Philip Murray expanded as a cure-all the
proposal for &ldquo;industry councils&rdquo; composed of labor,
employers and government representatives which &ndash; just how,
Murray did not make clear either at the convention or since &ndash;
would solve the country&rsquo;s major problems. In the four months
after the CIO convention Lewis made no public statement on any
question.</P>
<P>Was he sulking in his tent? Or was he pondering some bold steps to
urge upon the labor movement? Rumor was rife, and the inside-dope
columnists assured their readers that Lewis was coming forth under
the banner of a real Labor Party. The Stalinists in particular, still
hanging on to Lewis&rsquo; coat-tails &ndash; they even found aspects
to praise in Lewis&rsquo; support of Willkie &ndash; have recently
conducted a whispering campaign in the unions: Lewis would launch the
Labor Party, Lewis was breaking with the pro-war Murray, Lewis had
meant his criticism of the Mediation Board as, in reality, criticism
of Murray and Kennedy for serving on it, etc. etc.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Lewis Names His Price</H4>
<p class="fst">Well, Lewis has come out of his tent. The man-mountain has labored
&ndash; and brought forth a mouse. He produced it in his speech at a
testimonial dinner to Philip Murray at Harrisburg, Pa., April 30; the
text is published in the May 5th <B>CIO News</B>; every worker ought
to read it and study it.</P>
<P>The real point of Lewis&rsquo; speech was sugar-coated by an
attack on Knudsen and Hillman. He accurately characterized Knudsen as
a man &ldquo;who has devoted a life time to the baiting of labor,&rdquo;
and obviously meant Hillman when he scathingly referred to &ldquo;so-called
representatives of labor in government who squirm in their seats,
when Knudsen talks ...&rdquo;</P>
<P>But then came the point to which Lewis was leading:</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;MR. MURRAY WILL BE PROUD TO SUPPLY SOME REAL
REPRESENTATIVES (of labor in government).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fst">That, in a nutshell, is Lewis&rsquo; program for the American
workers for this epoch of universal war and militarism. &ldquo;Real&rdquo;
representatives are to be named by the CIO leaders to sit in the
Roosevelt government. &ldquo;This war,&rdquo; said Lewis, &ldquo;if
there is to be a war, cannot be won by baiting labor.&rdquo; In other
words, the war is to be conducted with the enthusiastic participation
in the government of &ldquo;real&rdquo; labor leaders supplied by
Murray and Lewis. &ldquo;Nor do we want to take part in any
imperialistic war,&rdquo; said Lewis at another point in his speech;
presumably he meant that, if &ldquo;real&rdquo; labor leaders were in
the service of the government, it would no longer be an imperialist
war.</P>
<P>That this is what Lewis meant is indicated by his warm praise for
the composition of the British war cabinet as contrasted to the
present composition of the American government. Said Lewis:</P>
<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;The difference between labor in the United
States and Britain is that in England today labor is a part of the
government; it sits in policy-making positions, and has a voice in
formulating policies. In the United States, labor is not represented,
it has no place in the government or in the cabinet. It has no
adequate representation in the Office of Production Management or the
National Defense Advisory Commissions or the War Department.&rdquo;</I><BR>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How the British Model Works</h4>
<p class="fst">So Lewis likes the British set-up? We&rsquo;d like to know how he
feels about its consequences. About the British government&rsquo;s
legislation outlawing strikes and rendering strikers punishable as
sabotagers. The British government&rsquo;s mobilizing strikers into
the army as punishment for striking. The outlawry of the British
<B>Daily Worker</B> (Lewis&rsquo; Stalinist admirers, who haven&rsquo;t
said a word about this speech of Lewis, ought, at the least, to ask
him about that!); the conscription of women workers; the failure to
keep prices down and profits from rising.</P>
<P>Above all, does Lewis&rsquo; approval of the composition of the
British government mean that he approves of its war aims? Its
incredibly inhuman, subjugation of the 475 millions of people in
India, who have no more rights than the inhabitants of the lands
dominated by Hitler? Its outlawry of the labor and peasant movement
of Ceylon and British West Africa? Its plainly indicated aim of
imposing another (even worse) Versailles Treaty on the German masses?
All this inevitably flows from the kind of government that England
now has.</P>
<P>Labor in &ldquo;equal&rdquo; partnership with capital in
government &ndash; this is the government of England and what Lewis
is proposing for this country. This at best &ndash; actually Lewis
doesn&rsquo;t even ask for equality in such partnership but merely
says that &ldquo;Mr. Murray will be proud to supply some real
representatives.&rdquo;<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>What Lewis&rsquo; Program Means</H4>
<p class="fst">Suppose Roosevelt and his Democratic Party (including its poll tax
Congressmen) were to accept John L. Lewis&rsquo; proposal. What,
concretely, would happen? Lewis, Murray, Kennedy and their friends
would sit in the cabinet, the OPM, the NDAC, the War Department. But
who would play the tune to which they would dance? All the legal
power would still be in the hands of the three main branches of the
government &ndash; the Congress, the President and the Supreme Court.
The CIO representatives in the government would be merely APPOINTEES
of the president, removable by him at any time.</P>
<P>If the crisis of American capitalism becomes serious, Roosevelt
may avail himself of just this proposal of John L. Lewis, appointing
labor leaders as so many fig-leafs to cover up the reactionary nature
of his regime. Or, to use an even more pertinent figure of speech,
Lewis and Murray would in a revolutionary crisis serve Roosevelt as
lightning-rods, harmlessly drawing off and burying the rising class
consciousness of the workers.</P>
<P>And after the crisis were thus weathered? Then Roosevelt could
unceremoniously boot out the door the labor leaders who have served
his purpose &ndash; and the labor movement would, at best, have to
start from the ground up at that time. Far more likely, having failed
to take over the governmental power in its entirety during the
revolutionary crisis, the labor movement would pay for that failure
by being driven down, down into the dust by an &ldquo;American&rdquo;
fascism or military dictatorship.</P>
<P>This is the dead-end to which John L. Lewis&rsquo; &ldquo;new&rdquo;
program would lead us. There is nothing new about it. Just such
coalitions between labor leaders and capitalists led to the downfall
of the labor movements of Germany, France, Spain, Belgium. For such
coalitions weakened, disrupted and discredited the labor movements of
those countries and left them easy prey for native reaction and
foreign invaders. Lewis is merely travelling in the footsteps of the
Blums, Kautskys, Caballeros, who led the European working class to
its doom. Like them, Lewis paves the way for a. native or foreign
Hitler.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>What Lewis Covers Up</H4>
<p class="fst">Lewis glides over the &ldquo;detail&rdquo; that his &ldquo;real
representatives&rdquo;&rsquo; would be APPOINTEES of Roosevelt. But
that is the key to the, whole problem. The reactionary nature of such
labor-capital coalitions is glaringly revealed by the specific form
of the U.S. government; here the &ldquo;labor representatives&rdquo;
would be appointed by a president and a Congress controlled by the
capitalist parties. In Britain the reality that Bevin and the other
Laborites are really nothing but appointees of Churchill and the Tory
party is covered over by the parliamentary formula of an agreement
between Conservative and Labor parties to form the government
together. The U.S. form of government has this little virtue &ndash;
it reveals more crudely the real relationship between a capitalist
president and Congress and their appointee labor lackeys.</P>
<P>NO LABOR LEADER SHALL ACCEPT APPOINTMENT BY A CAPITALIST
GOVERNMENT. It is this fundamental principle which Lewis&rsquo;
proposed program violates.</P>
<P>Speaking of the Hillmans (without mentioning them), Lewis said in
his speech:</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;It is true that there are some individuals from
labor in the (government) set-up. But they do not represent labor in
government; they represent the government in labor. Their business is
to chloroform labor so that it will be voiceless and supine and go
along with any policy in the interests of those who would make a
financial killing in this emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fst">Accurate words &ndash; but they also describe, in addition to the
present Hillmans, ANYBODY ELSE who would accept appointment by the
Roosevelt government. What two or three appointees are doing, would
also be done by twenty or thirty appointees. The same process, would
operate in either case.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>The Real Answer: The Labor Party</H4>
<p class="fst">We Trotskyists want to see real labor representatives in
government. But we mean just that. We want to see labor
<I>representatives</I> and not appointees of a capitalist president
and Congress. We want to see representatives of the working class who
are in government in spite of and against the will of the
capitalists. We don&rsquo;t want to see labor leaders serving as
labor lackeys of the political agents of the bosses. We want labor&rsquo;s
own, freely chosen by labor, without any commitments or &ldquo;partnership&rdquo;
deals with bosses.</P>
<P>Which means that we want a Labor Party, created by and controlled
by the organizations of the working class, launched with a class
program. We want a Labor Party militant enough to arouse, not only
the trade unionists, but also the unorganized workers, the toiling
farmers, the oppressed and disinherited of city and country. A Labor
Party whose candidates will be strictly controlled by the party and
under no circumstances ever to be candidates of capitalist parties.
Class against class &ndash; that is what is going on in the economic
field and is long overdue on the political field. It is time to end
the company unionism that Lewis and his type have for so long foisted
upon the working class in politics!</P>
<P>One representative elected to Congress by such a Labor Party will
be of infinitely more value to the working class than a hundred trade
union officials appointed, to government posts by Roosevelt. He will
be a real asset, where the hundred will be liabilities &ndash;
chloroform, in Lewis&rsquo; word &ndash; on the working class.</P>
<P>It is not at all a question, of counting our lone representative&rsquo;s
vote as against the many votes of the capitalist Congressmen. The
arithmetic of the class struggle operates differently than that &ndash;
a Labor Party spokesman in Congress will stand up as a tribune of the
people, summoning the masses to shout their demands so loud that even
the deafest poll-tax Congressman will, hear. A Labor Party spokesman
will speak, not to the Congressmen, but to the masses, summoning them
to struggle in all fields and everywhere &ndash; in the economic
field and in the armed forces, not merely at the ballot box.</P>
<P>That is why one such spokesman, genuinely representative of the
working class, cannot even be spoken of in the same category with the
labor lackeys appointed by a capitalist president and Congress.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>A Workers&rsquo; and Farmers&rsquo; Government</H4>
<p class="fst">Once the Labor Party would be launched, it would speedily
confront, the capitalist class as the authoritative representative of
the toiling masses &ndash; the great majority of the population. Long
before the corrupt and manipulable electoral machinery would register
more than a fraction of the Labor Party&rsquo;s actual strength, the
party would count millions of firm adherents. And they would register
their votes in many ways beside the ballot box &ndash; they would
register them every day wherever workers&rsquo; interests are
involved.</P>
<P>This war is but the extreme expression of the bankruptcy of the
capitalist class which Roosevelt represents. For the second time in a
generation it can offer us nothing but death and destruction. And
after the war it can offer us, at best, a return to the economic
crisis of 1929&ndash;1940. Those who, at this critical juncture in
the history of humanity, would tie the working class to the fate of
the capitalist class, would thereby lead it to the fate of the
European working class.</P>
<P>Labor must appear in the political arena not as appointed
servitors of the ruling class, but as the rightful leaders of the
nation. That is what the Labor Party means today.</P>
<P>Its goal js indicated by the needs of the masses &ndash; security
against war and fascism, against want and hunger. That means that the
Labor Party seeks the helm of the ship of society.</P>
<P>For a Workers&rsquo; and Farmers&rsquo; Government &ndash; that is
why we need, why we must have, a Labor Party.</P>
