<p class="fst">Dear Will:</p>

<p class="fst">Thank you for sending me the article from the Feb. 25 S<strong>unday
Worker</strong>. I have noted all the passages you have marked: the
headline &ndash; <em>German Communists lead fight on Nazi hunger</em> &ndash;
the picture of Thaelmann and the demand for his freedom, the
assertion that &ldquo;The Communists are just as merciless and
penetrating in their exposure of the lies of the German imperialists
as with the war propaganda of the Anglo-French bloc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You SO desperately want to believe that the Comintern is
undermining Hitler in Germany, and to disprove my arguments that the
Comintern now serves Hitler in return for the Stalin-Hitler pact,
that you painstakingly searched out every conceivable word in that
article which might prove your point. But you didn&rsquo;t underline
very much! The few things you underlined are so much embroidery; the
main content of the article, and in this it undoubtedly accurately
reflects, as it claims, the type of propaganda being carried on by
the Comintern in Germany is &ndash; a justification of the
Hitler-Stalin pact.</p>

<p>If, the day before the Hitler-Stalin pact, I had asked you: &ldquo;Is
it possible for Hitler to conduct a foreign policy beneficial to the
German workers?&rdquo; &ndash; what would you have answered? No! How
can bestial fascism do anything which serves the interests of the
workers! You understood then, quite firmly, that there was no
difference between Hitler&rsquo;s treaties and Hitler&rsquo;s
breaking of treaties: no difference, for instance, between Munich and
his march into Austria. Everything that he did, at home or abroad,
was reactionary. Everything without exception.</p>

<p>Now, however, you and your party try to tell me, Hitler has done
something very good. &ldquo;Very good&rdquo; is, indeed, a miserable
understatement. Few rulers, indeed, have ever achieved anything
remotely comparable on behalf of their people. Just see what,
according to that <strong>Sunday Worker</strong> article, Hitler has done for
the German people by concluding his pact with Stalin:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;The German-Soviet pact shows that the vital
interests of the German people can definitely be protected by
peaceful treaties, provided that the German working people decide
foreign policy and, have the power to guarantee such treaties.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">Yes, I note the &ldquo;provided that&rdquo;. But the Stalin-Hitler
pact was concluded without those provisions; the German workers had
no voice in it and no power to guarantee it. Apparently, therefore,
&ldquo;the German people can definitely be protected by peaceful
treaties&rdquo; even though they are bound and gagged and tortured by
Hitler!</p>

<p>Here is another tremendous compliment paid to Hitler by the same
<strong>Sunday Worker</strong> article:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;... The Soviet Union&rsquo;s pacts with Germany
rescued the German people from the worst of counter-revolutionary
wars and ditched the predatory plans of the Allied warmakers against
both the Soviet and the German peoples.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Hitler has seldom had such compliments paid to him, even by his
own lickspittles. Just think! With a wave of his pen, Hitler saved
the German people &ldquo;from the worst of counter-revolutionary
wars&rdquo; and &ldquo;ditched the predatory plans of the Allied
warmakers.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Effect of Stalinist Propaganda in Germany</h4>

<p class="fst">What, logically, would be the effect of such propaganda on German
workers who want a free, united Germany, who want to be rid of
Hitler, but fear also the occupation of Germany by the Allies ?</p>

<p>If he accepted the propaganda of your party, the German worker
could only conclude:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;After all, Hitler at the helm is not the worst
thing. He has saved us from the worst of counter-revolutionary wars,
has ditched the predatory plans of the Allied warmakers, has
protected our vital interests by peaceful treaties with the Soviet
Union. Better that than another Versailles. We must wait until after
the war before overturning a regime which can do these things.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Not even the terrible hardships of the war as it unfolds, the
daily toll of dead and wounded, the hunger at home as the blockade
finds its victims from afar, not even these things, which caused the
German proletariat to make a revolution in 1918, will spur to revolt
the German worker who is under the influence of your party. For, to
revolt, the workers in 1918 had finally to see: the main enemy is at
home, the Kaiser, the Junkers, the capitalists, they are responsible
for this war. The way to stop the war is for us, the workers, to stop
fighting, to stop working for this war machine.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Stalin Whitewashes Hitler&rsquo;s War Guilt</h4>

<p class="fst">But the worker under the influence of your party will never get to
that point of revolt! For your party is not telling him that Hitler
is responsible for this war. Your party is not telling the German
worker that the main enemy is at home. Your party is telling him that
the Allies are responsible for the war. I quote another of the many
key paragraphs you did not underline:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;Brushing aside the legalistic &lsquo;origins&rsquo;
of the present war, the Communists point to THE REAL PROVOCATION OF
THE WAR IN THE SYSTEMATIC EFFORTS OF THE ANGLO-FRENCH IMPERIALISTS to
bring the Soviet Union and Germany into a head-on collision. With
this goal in view, the British imperialists supported art entire
series of German fascist aggressions ... The Soviet Union effectively
scotched these plots by its pacts with Germany,&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">If your party could convince the German workers that &ldquo;the
systematic efforts of the Anglo-French imperialists&rdquo; is the
&ldquo;real provocation of the war&rdquo;, then why should they cease
fighting and working for the German army? What would be the use, if
the Anglo-French are alone responsible for the war? To stop war, one
must deal blows at those responsible. They, according to your party,
are outside Germany. The main enemy is not at home.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Leninist Slogans Absent from Comintern Line</h4>

<p class="fst">The article points out correctly that the Anglo-French are not
fighting for the freedom of Poland, the Czech and Austrian peoples.
But search that article, and all the others of your party since the
Hitler-Stalin pact, and nowhere will you find the elementary slogans
on this question dictated to every real Leninist: For the freedom of
the Polish, Czech, Slovak peoples from the yoke of Hitler! Is it an
accident that a lengthy article describing Communist propaganda in
Germany does not say these things? No, it is by design: the Leninist
slogans against war are completely alien to the Comintern line in
Germany.</p>

<p>In America, your party is raising the slogan: &ldquo;Not a man,
not a cent, not a gun, for the imperialist war!&rdquo; Why don&rsquo;t
your party raise the same slogan in Germany ? Because, in return for
the pact with Stalin, your party serves Hitler. To serve him well, it
must do so not too crudely. Therefore, as the article puts it, &ldquo;One
of their central rallying cries is the demand for the release of
Thaelmann.&rdquo; Thaelmann should be freed. But can that possibly be
a CENTRAL rallying slogan?</p>

<p>Look through that article again, and what other &ldquo;rallying
cries&rdquo; do you find ? &ldquo;They call the people to action
against the fearfully low wages and the sky-high of war profits, the
mistreatment and bad food&rdquo; &ndash; and these &ldquo;action&rdquo;
slogans are justified by this: &ldquo;The Communists emphasize that
the fight for the immediate interests of the people is identical with
the struggle against the war policy of German big capital.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A Pseudo-Radical Cover for Serving Hitler</h4>

<p class="fst">That sounds radical, until you analyze it. Is &ldquo;the war
policy of German big capital&rdquo; identical with fearfully low
wages, war profits, etc., or is it something more? <em>We</em>, the
Trotskyists, would say that low wages, profiteering, etc., although
to be fought against, are merely accompaniments to German
imperialism&rsquo;s war policy. The war policy itself is: the aim of
imperialist expansion, the attempt to redivide the world. In other
words, German imperialism, Hitler, is responsible for the fact of war
itself.</p>

<p>But your party cannot say this, for it has already blamed the war
on the Allies. Nor can it even fight against low wages and hunger
effectively.</p>

<p>In a word, do you want a picture of your party in Germany? Then
look at the Socialist party of France, or the British Labor Party.
They, too, talk of fighting low wages and hunger; but their war
policy makes it impossible. Thus they serve the British and French
rulers &ndash; as your party serves Hitler.</p>

<p>More, much more, can be said on this question. I shall return to
it next week.</p>
