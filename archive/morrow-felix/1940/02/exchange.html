<h1>An Exchange with Lovestone<br />
on Finland</h1>

<h3>(24 February 1940)</h3>

<hr class="infotop" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>, <a href="../../../../history/etol/newspape/themilitant/socialist-appeal-1940/index.htm#sa04_08" target="new">Vol. IV No. 8</a>, 24 February 1940, p.&nbsp;3.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="../../../../admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Marxists&#8217; Internet Archive</strong>.</p>

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">In the January 27 issue of the <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong> we
commented editorially on a speech by a Czarist officer advocating aid
to Finland. He had said in calling upon Czarist Russians to fight
against the Soviet Union:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;For twenty-two years we have been waiting for this
moment. Now there is a place where we can go back from.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">And our comment was:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;There in two sentences is the whole story of all
the tear-jerking money-raising committees to aid &lsquo;poor little
Finland&rsquo; against &lsquo;Russian imperialism,&rsquo; from Hoover
down to the wretched Lovestoneites and Thomasites.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">In previous issues we had devoted a good many thousands of words
to a painstaking analysis of the pro-Finland line of Norman Thomas&rsquo;
Socialist Party and of the Lovestoneites. Both these groups have
carefully refrained from answering our case against them.</p>

<p>At long last, however, the Lovestone <strong>Workers Age</strong> of
February 17 replies. Its reply consists of a purported analysis of
the editorial quoted above. It charges us with &ldquo;the
construction of an amalgam of labor and radical groups with the
Russian monarchists, similar to the cheap and vicious type of
argumentation used for the last fourteen years by Stalin against the
Trotskyites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is it? All that the editorial and all our articles on Finland, say
is: those who support Finland against the Soviet Union are supporting
an outpost of imperialism against a workers&rsquo; state. Defeat of
the Red Army on the Finnish front would be followed by an imperialist
invasion to destroy the workers&rsquo; state and restore
capitalism.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>They Argue Like Social Democrats</h4>

<p class="fst">The <strong>Workers Age</strong> is not yet quite as brazen as the <strong>New
Leader</strong>. But, at the risk of being accused of another amalgam, we
must say that its cases for supporting Finland against the Soviet
Union is based on the same fundamental assumptions as that of the <strong>New
Leader</strong>. The latter declares it a war between democracy and
dictatorship, points as proof to the house-broken social democratic
deputies, and minimizes the role of Mannerheim. And what does the
<strong>Workers Age</strong> do? We quote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Both the <strong>Daily Worker</strong> and <strong>Socialist
Appeal</strong> ... raise the menace of the White Guardist Mannerheim to
gigantic and grotesque proportions, with the same intent in view, to
prove that Finland is a White Guard outpost for the destruction of
the USSR. All those who dare to raise their voices for the defense of
Finnish independence can then be dubbed as &lsquo;agents of Baron
Mannerheim.&rsquo; Great care must be exercised to conceal the fact
that out of 200 members of the Finnish parliament, the largest group,
85, are socialists, and that 143 represent workers or peasants
parties. Otherwise, the cry of a &lsquo;White Guard Mannerheim
regime,&rsquo; would fall to the ground, and without a Mannerheim
bugaboo, the amalgam would be worthless.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">In passing, the <strong>Workers Age</strong> makes a little amalgam between
the <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong> and the <strong>Daily Worker</strong>. We have
pointed out the composition of the Finnish parliament; we have not
called the bourgeois republic a White Guard regime. But all that is
unimportant. What is most significant in the <strong>Workers Age</strong>
article is that this paper of a group which once called itself
followers of Lenin, has degenerated to the point where (1) it does
not recognize that Mannerheim, commander-in-chief of the armed forces
of the Finnish bourgeoisie, represents the class in power; (2) it can
adduce as a decisive counter-weight to Mannerheim the fact that
impotent and cowardly representatives of reformist parties sit in the
bourgeois parliament; (3) it can deny that any bourgeois country on
the frontiers of the Soviet Union must serve as a base for
imperialist intervention. By the by, as it were, the <strong>Workers Age</strong>
throws overboard the Marxist theory of the state.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>They Once Called Themselves Leninists!</h4>

<p class="fst">Now listen to this, from people who once called themselves
adherents of Lenin&rsquo;s theory of the progressive role of colonial
wars against imperialist powers:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Nor is it ever explained (by the Trotskyists) why
if Mannerheim&rsquo;s participation in the Finnish defense ...
deprives the Finns of our sympathy, the same is not true for China
and Chiang Kai- shek ... Because Chiang Kai-shek is head of the
Chinese Nationalist government, are we therefore to bless the
Japanese invader and deny the Chinese masses our sympathy and
support?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The only logic by which this extraordinary paragraph would make
sense would be by the argument that in all wars we oppose the
&ldquo;invader.&rdquo; But we would defend China against Japan if
China were the initiator of hostilities. We, as followers of Marx and
Lenin, don&rsquo;t choose sides on the legalistic argument of who
crossed whose frontier line first, but we choose sides by a class
criterion: the workers against the bosses, workers&rsquo; state
against capitalist state, oppressed colonial people against
imperialist. Yes, one must defend these elementary Marxist
propositions today against the Lovestoneite ex-Leninists.</p>

<p>In the characteristic style of all the social democratic war
mongers these days, the Lovestoneites conclude with a denunciation of
our belief that &ldquo;the end justifies the means.&rdquo; Yes, we
recognize no separation between ends and means. Neither does any
naturalistic ethics which has broken with supernaturalism. John
Dewey&rsquo;s &ldquo;crime&rdquo; to religionists is precisely that
he establishes that means have no meaning apart from ends. But the
Lovestoneites will scarcely trouble to find out what the concept
really means. It sounds like an epithet, thanks to religious
propaganda, and so they hurl it at us. Who hurls it? The people who
defended Stalin&rsquo;s frameup trials against Zinoviev, Kamenev,
Radek and Piatakov!</p>
