<p class="fst">When, three months ago, the Norman Thomas Socialists and the
Lovestone group voted with the American Labor Party leaders for a
pro-Ally resolution on foreign policy, we predicted: they are taking
the road to &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; patriotism. Verification of our
prediction has come quickly enough; General Thomas and Colonel
Lovestone are now enrolled in the American Expeditionary Force for
Finland.</p>

<p>The social and ideological roots leading to this course did not of
course, begin three months ago. The interested reader may find a
critical history of the development (degeneration) of these groups by
reading the polemics in the Trotskyist press against them at each
stage of the last ten years. Even well-disposed readers of our press
felt at times (I suspect) as they read these polemics, that there was
in them a good deal of hair-splitting. The dismembered hair turns
out, however, to be No Man&rsquo;s Land, with the contending groups
in opposing trenches. They wear the uniform of capitalist
intervention, we the uniform of the Red Army. Not a small
difference.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Their Crushing Answer to Us</h4>

<p class="fst">Thomas-Lovestone have a crushing reply to us: you are in the Red
Army of Stalin. We have already answered that charge, not once, but
thousands of times in the last ten years. Our fundamental starting
point on the Russian question has been a basic distinction between
the Soviet Union and the Stalinist bureaucracy. The economic
conquests of the October revolution are the Soviet Union. The
parasitic growth upon it of a degenerate bureaucracy is a fact which
we Trotskyists analyzed and fought during many years when
Thomas-Lovestone called us, as a consequence, anti-Soviet. To save
the Soviet Union, the bureaucracy must be overthrown by a political
revolution, arms in hand. But overthrown by the workers, and not by
capitalist intervention. Against the capitalist world, we defend the
Soviet Union. This has been our position consistently during the last
years, and Thomas-Lovestone never dreamed of calling us allies of
Stalin. Before they could make that charge, they had to go over
bodily to the opposite trenches.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Thomas Was a Bit Hasty</h4>

<p class="fst">Our standpoint is based, we repeat, on a fundamental distinction
between Soviet economy and the Stalinist bureaucracy. Can
Thomas-Lovestone suggest a similar fundamental distinction between
Finnish economy and the Finnish bourgeoisie, as a justification for
supporting the Finnish puppets of Chamberlain-Daladier-Roosevelt?
Thomas seems to have sought such a distinction, with the result that
the <strong>Socialist Call</strong> printed some weird fairy tales, in
editorial form, about the economic paradise in which the Finnish
workers and peasants live. There was a rather abrupt cessation of
those editorials, however; maybe somebody read off to Thomas the
League of Nations statistics on Finnish land ownership.</p>

<p>This is an old problem for &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; patriots &ndash;
how to make a distinction between themselves and the capitalists when
both are united in war aims. Much ingenuity was exercised on this
problem during the first World War by the Social Democrats in
distinguishing themselves from the Kaiser, Poincar&eacute;, Lloyd
George, etc.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Lovestone&rsquo;s &ldquo;Clever&rdquo; Formula</h4>

<p class="fst">It must be readily conceded that Lovestone is far more clever at
this game than Thomas. The <strong>Socialist Call</strong> rushed headlong into
a series of indiscretions which it is now trying to cover up; while
the <strong>Workers Age</strong> preserved a sly silence until a skillful
formula could be found. That formula has finally been worked out and
is presented in an editorial in the latest <strong>Workers Age</strong>
(January 6). We give its salient portions:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;... we stand with the Finnish masses in their
heroic fight to beat back the invader ... We say frankly that we do
not trust the Finnish government; we do not regard it as a reliable,
steadfast champion of Finnish independence. The present ruling
elements in Finland are bound very closely to the British Foreign
Office, and to the British Foreign Office Finland is simply a pawn in
the game of imperialist diplomacy. British diplomacy sacrificed
Czecho-Slovakia to Hitler; a few weeks ago it offered to make a deal
with Stalin at the expense of half of Poland. Who knows what
intrigues are now being carried on by the agents of Downing Street at
the expense of the Finns. No group in Finland that is so closely
linked up with the British Foreign Office as are the bourgeois ruling
circles of that country can be fully trusted to defend Finnish
independence to the last.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">A clever formula. It enables Lovestone to speak harshly about the
Finnish bourgeoisie (whereas Thomas made the mistake of presenting
them as house-broken), to characterize them as puppets of the
imperialists (which Thomas had denied), and to &ldquo;demand&rdquo;
that labor aid Finland &ldquo;independently&rdquo; of Hoover, a
clever formula &ndash; but only for those who are seeking such
formulas.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Lovestone Sets His Demands</h4>

<p class="fst">For note its internal logic. The Finnish bourgeoisie cannot be
trusted. Therefore overthrow them? Don&rsquo;t defend their Finland,
but only a socialist Finland? Not a bit of it, says Lovestone: by all
means defend bourgeois Finland. What he doesn&rsquo;t trust the
bourgeoisie to do is just that &ndash; defend bourgeois Finland. He&rsquo;s
afraid they will surrender to Stalin, as the Czechoslovaks
surrendered to Hitler, at British insistence.</p>

<p>Suppose the British Foreign Office reassures Lovestone that it has
no such intention. Suppose it gives him guarantees, by sending a
fleet through the Dardanelles to strike through Odessa and another
through Siberia. With such reassurance &ndash; and it appears to be
coming &ndash; Lovestone will have no further reservations to make concerning the
wholeheartedness of his alliance with the Finnish bourgeoisie.</p>
