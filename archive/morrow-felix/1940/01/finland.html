<h1><em>The Call</em> and Some of Its Friends<br />
on Finland</h1>

<h3>(6 January 1940)</h3>

<hr class="infotop" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>, <a href="../../../../history/etol/newspape/themilitant/socialist-appeal-1940/index.htm#sa04_01" target="new">Vol. IV No. 1</a>, 6 January 1940, p.&nbsp;2.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="../../../../admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Marxists&#8217; Internet Archive</strong>.</p>

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">Norman Thomas&rsquo; <strong>Call</strong> appears to be losing some of its
original enthusiasm for the cause of Finland. The last two issues
have been couched in a distinctly lower key than the clarion call for
world aid to Finland with which the <strong>Call</strong> editor, Gerry Allard,
greeted the events (&ldquo;In that struggle every human being who
cherishes freedom will support the heroic Finns.&rdquo; &ndash; <strong>Call</strong>,
Dec. 9). The eight-column banner across the front page, <em>Finland&rsquo;s
Fight: A World Cause</em> (Dec. 16) has not been repeated. It may be
that Messrs. Thomas, Allard and Symes have been a little
flabbergasted by the enthusiastic response &ndash; from the Allied
Supreme War Council, Herbert Hoover, the Swedish nobility, and other
democrats &ndash; to the <strong>Call</strong>&rsquo;s exhortations for aid to
Finland.</p>

<p>The Jan. 6 <strong>Call</strong> reports that many letters have been
received criticising or commending its stand. It publishes a
commendatory letter from the well-known millionaire socialist, Alfred
Baker Lewis, which concludes: &ldquo;The fact that Italy has, for her
own national interests, supplied some limited support for Finland
ought not to deter Socialists from urging full economic aid to
Finland as the victim of totalitarian aggression.&rdquo; A critical
letter from the Debs circle of the Young Socialists of Los Angeles
declares: &ldquo;We are not only shocked but defiant as to the right
of the editor to write such an article advocating that the Socialist
party furnish the Finns with arms and munitions. We feel that such an
idea is directly opposed to the Socialist stand on war ...&rdquo; A
letter from Paul Jones says: &ldquo;But I do hate to see the <strong>Call</strong>
taking a position right up close to the band in the march toward war.
That is no place for a Socialist paper ... for Pete&rsquo;s sake put
on the brakes before you go any further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amazingly enough, these letters are printed without a word of
editorial comment. <strong>The Call</strong> will maintain a dignified silence
for a while, it appears.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>An Indignant Lady Columnist</h4>

<p class="fst">But not quite. While no party spokesman speaks on the questions at
issue, the columns of the <strong>Call</strong> are turned over to an attack on
Trotsky, entitled <em>On Socialist Ideals</em>, reprinted from the <strong>New
York Post</strong>, and written by the <strong>Post</strong> columnist, Dorothy
Dunbar Bromley.</p>

<p>This lady declares that &ldquo;Not only Stalin but Trotsky must be
counted among the betrayers.&rdquo; At first glance it may appear
that the lady is really polemicising against the Trotskyists, for she
refers to the Dec.&nbsp;1 and Dec.&nbsp;9 issues of the <strong>Appeal</strong>.
A little light begins to appear, however, when she writes: &ldquo;Jay
Lovestone, unlike that other dissident, Trotsky, has described the
attack on Finland as &lsquo;yellow&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since anybody who actually read the Dec.&nbsp;1 and Dec.&nbsp;9
issues of the <strong>Appeal</strong> knows that the Trotskyists characterized
the attack on Finland in terms far more harsh, and much more precise,
than &ldquo;yellow&rdquo;, it becomes obvious that Miss Bromley
doesn&rsquo;t know what she is talking about. Similar comments by
other newspaper writers and radio commentators made it clear that
their misinformation about the Trotskyist position</p>

<p>came from a central source. Upon inquiry, that source of
misinformation was established: a mimeographed weekly, entitled
<strong>Uncensored</strong>, launched by the well-known Thomasite impresario,
Mary Fox, and edited by Sidney Hertzberg, a member of the Socialist
party. Miss Bromley&rsquo;s &ldquo;references&rdquo; to the Dec.&nbsp;1
and&nbsp;9 issues of the <strong>Appeal</strong> came from a very tricky
paragraph in <strong>Uncensored</strong>, which characterizeed the Trotskyist
position as &ldquo;the first gesture&rdquo; of Trotsky to Stalin!</p>

<p>Having launched this bit of fakery, the Socialist party now prints
it, in the form of a column by Miss Bromley, as &ldquo;independent&rdquo;
verification of the fakery!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>It Depends Where You Stand</h4>

<p class="fst">However, it should be added that from a certain vantage point the
fundamental difference between the Trotskyist position and that of
the Stalinists tends to be blurred. If someone stands far enough over
on the right, two points which are actually distant from each other
but are both to the left of that observer, may seem closer together,
than they are in reality.</p>

<p>An instance of this perspective is Mr. Ferdinand Lundberg, the
author, who is one of the sponsors of <strong>Uncensored</strong>. I sent him a
copy of a letter I wrote to <strong>Uncensored</strong>, protesting its false
statement of the Trotskyist position. He replied that &ldquo;for the
life of me I can&rsquo;t see wherein your position has been
distorted&rdquo;; and after one reads his letter, it becomes clear
why he cannot make any distinction between the Stalinist position and
that of the Trotskyists. For it is perfectly true that the
Trotskyists are defenders of the Soviet Union, who will not defend a
bourgeois Finland, although they would defend an independent Soviet
Finland against Stalin. Whereas Mr. Lundberg thinks the, Finns would
be damn fools if they started a revolution. Mr. Lundberg writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;The important thing is not that Finland is
bourgeois. One might say that is of no importance at all except to
hopelessly doctrinaire sectarian revolutionists who are wandering
deeper and deeper into a blind alley. The important thing is that a
small, hardworking, self-respecting, upright people has been set upon
by a cowed, fear driven rabble ...</em></p>

<p class="quote"><em>&ldquo;I certainly think the Finns are right in
defending themselves against the bovine Stalinist hordes, who are the
ones that should act upon Lenin&rsquo;s dictum and turn their guns
against their own officers. The Finns would be damn fools if they
started a &lsquo;socialist&rsquo; revolution and Stalin would be
glad. Personally, I hope the Finns give the precious Red Army a
clawing it will never forget. And I sincerely hope that Soviet Russia
is weakened by the invasion.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">Mr. Lundberg&rsquo;s remarks have this value: they give, a little
more incautiously than others, the real vantage point of all those
who denounce the Trotskyist position as a concession to Stalinism:
the vantage point of democratic-imperialist patriotism.</p>
