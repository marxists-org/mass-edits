<p class="fst">A letter in the January 20 issue of Norman Thomas&rsquo; <strong>Call</strong>
is worth reprinting in full:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;To the Editor:</em></p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;The Jewish section of the Socialist party,
Chicago, affiliated with the Jewish labor committee, whose function
is to lead the fight against Fascism and anti-Semitism, expresses its
dissatisfaction with the plans for a meeting to protest at the same
time Nazism and Stalinism. Such a meeting is arranged in conjunction
with the Czech, Polish and Finnish national councils.</em></p>

<p class="quote"><em>&ldquo;The Jewish section has more than once declared
its opposition to Stalinism and the dictatorship practiced by the
Soviet Union. We believe, however, that to protest against the brutal
barbarism of Nazism, especially the savage persecution of the Jewish
masses, and at the same time against the dictatorship of the Soviet
Union, will detract from the effect of a protest against Nazism.</em></p>

<p class="quote"><em>&ldquo;Furthermore, we believe that such a protest
meeting held in common with the bourgeois national councils, will be
used primarily to attack the Soviet Union, with the object of
severing diplomatic relations in keeping with the demand of the most
reactionary forces in America.</em></p>

<p class="quote"><em>&ldquo;The Jewish section in Chicago declares that
such action of the Jewish Labor committee is unjustified and harmful
both from the Jewish, and from the Labor and Socialist standpoint. We
hold it is especially important that our criticism of the Soviet
Union be made as a working-class organization, that our protest
against Stalinism be conducted independently of bourgeois and
reactionary elements.</em></p>

<p class="quote"><em>&ldquo;Therefore, the Jewish section of the Socialist
party, Chicago, is compelled not to participate in the planned
protest meeting, disclaiming all responsibility for this action of
the Jewish Labor- committee.</em></p>

<h4>Also a Condemnation of Thomas</h4>

<p class="fst">This letter is very much in point. It indicates that there are
people in the Socialist party who are not going along with the
reactionary Thomas-Symes-Trager line of uniting with war-mongers in
attacks upon the Soviet Union. The letter is, logically, not only a
condemnation of the Chicago Jewish Labor committee&rsquo;s action,
but also a condemnation of the Socialist party&rsquo;s support of the
anti-Soviet resolutions, of the jingo leaders of the American Labor
party, its support of bourgeois Finland, etc.</p>

<p>The sentiment expressed in this letter must be widespread among
the rank and file of the Socialist party, for there has been a change
of tone in the <strong>Call</strong>. It is no longer screaming at the toff of
its voice for arms for Finland. It has made no attempt to answer our
criticism of its jingo editorials on behalf of &ldquo;democratic&rdquo;
Finland.</p>

<p>The change of tone is not, however, a change of policy.
Underneath, the line remains the same reactionary line of backing
Finland in the war, a &ldquo;left&rdquo; formulation of it, to hold
on to class-conscious workers who are outraged by the brazen Hoover
formulations with which the <strong>Call</strong> began.</p>

<p>The letter of the Chicago Socialists correctly denounces the
Jewish Labor committee for joining with bourgeois groups in attacks
on the Soviet Union. Is there any difference between that crime and
that committed by Thomas? He writes; for example, in the January 20
<strong>Call</strong>: &ldquo;We should do ourselves, and even encourage the
government to do all that can be done for the Finns ...&rdquo; He
adds, queasily, &ldquo;That is, all that can be done without
involving or threatening to involve America in war.&rdquo; To call
upon the War Deal government of America to aid Finland &ndash; is
that &ldquo;a protest against Stalinism conducted independently of
bourgeois and reactionary elements&rdquo;? The letter of the Chicago
Socialists should have been directed against Thomas and the <strong>Call</strong>
as much as against the Jewish Labor committee.</p>

<p>Thomas says: &ldquo;The aid given should be non-military.&rdquo;
Why? Either the cause of Finland is one deserving working class
support, in which case it should be supported with arms, or it is
unworthy of support, in which case it should get nothing at all;
Thomas&rsquo; is a dishonest formula, designed to placate
class-conscious workers in his ranks, while continuing his united
front with Hoover for Finland.</p>

<p>Henry Haskell, in the same issue of the <strong>Call</strong>, makes a
contribution which would provoke much merriment, if the issue were
not so deadly serious, He writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Socialists should make a sharp distinction between
workers&rsquo; aid to Finland, and aid by reactionaries like Hoover
and also the Roosevelt administration ... When the workers all over
the world come to the aid of Finland, that is something else again,
and must be of great concern to the leaders in the Kremlin.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">By the same token, every worker in the world coming to the support
of the Anglo-French camp, would change the class-character of that
war. And that, in fact, is what the &ldquo;democratic,&rdquo; &ldquo;anti
imperialist&rdquo; wing of Anglo-French jingoism is trying to sell
the American workers.</p>

<p>Let us hope that the Chicago Socialists, and every worker in the
Socialist party, applies to the Socialist party&rsquo;s line the
principles enunciated in their letter. If they do, we shall gladly
join hands with them in a revolutionary Marxist struggle against
Stalinism, the only kind of struggle which can destroy Stalinism, win
independence for a Soviet Finland, and save the Soviet Union from
capitalist restoration.</p>
