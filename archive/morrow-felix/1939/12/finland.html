<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>, <a href="../../../../history/etol/newspape/themilitant/socialist-appeal-1939/index.htm#sa03_95" target="new">Vol. III No. 95</a>, 30 December 1939, p.&nbsp;3.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="../../../../admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Marxists&#8217; Internet Archive</strong>.</p>

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">Reading the articles and editorials on Finland in the recent
issues of Norman Thomas&rsquo; paper, <strong>The Call</strong>, I was reminded
again and again of an appropriate comment provided by a sentence in
<em>War and the Fourth International</em>, the theses on war adopted by
our movement in 1934.</p>

<p>That sentence reads: &ldquo;Only a hopelessly dull bourgeois from
a god-forsaken Swiss village &ndash; like Robert Grimm &ndash; can
seriously think that the world war into which he is drawn is waged
for the defense of Swiss independence.&rdquo; That sentence must now
be modified to include Norman Thomas, Lillian Symes, Gerry Allard and
the rest of the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party,
U.S.A. The political and intellectual characterization &ndash;
hopelessly dull bourgeois &ndash; fits them like a glove. They live
in New York and Chicago, but that does not abate one bit their
hopeless political provincialism.</p>

<p>If these remarks seem harsh, the alternative is even more damning.
Either Messrs. Thomas, Allard &amp; Co. do not have the political and
mental horizon to understand that the Finnish events are an incident
in the imperialist war for the re-division of the earth; or they are
agents of the &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; imperialists.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Knights in Shining Armor</h4>

<p class="fst">The editor of <strong>The Call</strong> greeted the Finnish events with an
article entitled <em>Support the Finns!</em> He concluded with a
ringing call: &ldquo;In that struggle every human being who cherishes
freedom will support the heroic Finns.&rdquo; In answer, the Allied
Supreme War Council has hearkened to his words.</p>

<p>The next issue of <strong>The Call</strong> (Dec.&nbsp;16) carried an
appropriate eight column banner across its front page: <em>Finland&rsquo;s
Fight: A World Cause</em>. The leading article, by Norman Thomas, left
no doubt where he stood in this world cause. &ldquo;Of course the
United States ought to do all that our government and people have
done to express their horror at Stalin&rsquo;s crime, that includes
foregoing Finland&rsquo;s debt.&rdquo; Thus wrote Norman Thomas.</p>

<p>A full-dress editorial told the world that: &ldquo;Only among the
Stalinists &ndash; and those even more talking about &lsquo;poor
little Finland,&rsquo; or poor little Trotskyists &ndash; is there
any illusion left that Russia is a Socialist or even a Workers&rsquo;
state.&rdquo; No, said <strong>The Call</strong>, the real Utopia is Finland:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The White Guardist generals, including Mannerheim,
were deprived of virtually all economic and political power when
their estates were confiscated and divided. Mannerheim has played no
role whatever in politics for many years.&rdquo; (The editorial
neglected to point out that Mannerheim has been reduced to
commander-in-chief of the Finnish armies.)</p>

<p class="fst">The editorial went on to vigorously denounce the &ldquo;pretense&rdquo;
that &ldquo;Finland was acting as the cat&rsquo;s paw of Britain,&rdquo;
and to give us the very interesting information that &ldquo;the
British and French governments since the (Nazi) pact have disclosed
their determination to appease Russia, even at the price of throwing
half of Poland, and possibly all of Finland, into its maw. They were
even visibly annoyed when Finland threw its problem into the lap of
the League of Nations.&rdquo; They have since, presumably, expressed
that annoyance by expelling Russia from the League.</p>

<p>Everything else <strong>The Call</strong> has had to say is of the same
stripe. Lillian Symes (Dec. 16) cannot contain her contempt for the
Trotskyists who say that Finland is a pawn of the imperialists.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she counters triumphantly, &ldquo;in
spite of the fact that both England and France have shown their
complete willingness to let Finland go the way of Czechoslovakia and
Loyalist Spain and have been assiduously courting Stalin ever since
the Stalin-Hitler pact.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>S.P. Members Protest</h4>

<p class="fst">It is no secret that the foregoing reactions of the Socialist
Party leadership did not sit well with considerable sections of the
membership. Even a congenital reformist like Raymond Hofses, editor
of the Reading (Pa.) <strong>Labor Advocate</strong>, wrote in:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;What worries me is his (editor Allard) apparent
belief that it has at last become the business of American Socialists
to take the side of war and that, however we may have rejected the
proposition that the conflict between Britain and France on the one
side and Germany on the other was a holy war, we shall not take the
same viewpoint when the opponents are Germany&rsquo;s totalitarian
ally and Britain&rsquo;s potential pawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Various branches of the Socialist Party adopted resolutions
attacking the pro-war line of <strong>The Call</strong>.</p>

<p>Under pressure of the protests, the official resolution on the
Finnish crisis adopted by the National Executive Committee of the
Socialist Party (<strong>The Call</strong>, Dec. 23) retreats from the previous
positions &ndash; but only verbally. Where Allard wrote &ldquo;Finns,&rdquo;
the resolution says &ldquo;Finnish workers&rdquo;; it explicitly
disavows the proposition that Finland is a socialist state, but then
defines it as not a capitalist state either: &ldquo;We believe that
the democracy of Finland differs from that of England and France in
degree of workers&rsquo; control. It is this, taken together with the
fact that Finland has no imperialist ambitions and is free from any
taint of colonial exploitation, that is a determining factor in our
attitude.&rdquo; It asks for &ldquo;the formation of independent
labor committees to aid Finland &ndash; in contrast to committees
headed by capitalist politicians and <em>perhaps</em> used by them for
their own interests.&rdquo; (That &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; is perfect!)
&ldquo;We support the move for the cancellation of Finland&rsquo;s
debt&rdquo; &ndash; i.e., they support American governmental actions
on behalf of Finland.</p>

<p>What is the difference between the latest resolution and the
previous position taken by <strong>The Call</strong>? Verbal only, that is
clear. But that raises the question with which we began: are Messrs.
Thomas, Allard &amp; Co. simply lacking in the political and mental
horizon to understand that the Finnish events are an incident in the
imperialist war? Or are they becoming agents of the &ldquo;democratic&rdquo;
imperialists, like the rest of their brothers of the Second
International? Precisely when they abandon their cruder formulations
and go over to more subtle, more confusing, but definitely
chauvinistic formulations, it becomes more difficult to think of them
as merely honest fat-heads.</p>
