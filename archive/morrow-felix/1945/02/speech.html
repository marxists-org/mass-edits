<p class="fst">>We went to prison for a party in which we have supreme faith &ndash; a trade union which had every right to exist &ndash; and a principle of workers&rsquo; liberties which every militant worker could understand if only our voices could reach him. And we reached millions of such workers.</p>

<p>What is important is that several millions of workers learned to understand the principles involved in this case and learned what a threat to the labor movement is contained in the Smith Act and similar legislation. Those workers are ready for the next fight.</p>

<p>To those workers I want to state what may sound like a commonplace, and yet if every worker in this country understood it and acted upon it, there could be no Smith Acts and no anti-labor prosecutions. This thought is that had the whole labor movement firmly fought against the Smith Act, it could never have been passed.</p>

<p>Yes, the AFL and CIO were &ldquo;on record&rdquo; against it &ndash; they simply and perfunctorily recorded their dislike of the Smith Act. But &ndash; there was not a single mass meeting of the trade unions in any city against the Smith Bill. There was not even a single international union which bought radio time to broadcast against the Smith Bill.</p>

<p>Instead of continuing this list, let me just say &ndash; none of the things were done which the CIO has been doing this week in its fight to make Wallace the Secretary of Commerce. I don&rsquo;t think it matters who is Secretary of Commerce &ndash; but that&rsquo;s not my point. The point is that the outpouring of leaflets, radio time, mass meetings, delegations of labor to Capitol Hill, etc., which we have just seen for Wallace &ndash; none of this was forthcoming from the AFL and CIO national bodies during the time the Smith Bill was up before Congress. Not that the fight for Wallace is a model of how labor should fight for something it wants.</p>

<p>The fight against reaction must be waged by bringing together all workers and friends of civil liberties regardless of their political beliefs. This is the thought I want you to take back with you to your factories and unions &ndash; we can successfully fight reaction only if the great majority of the workers&rsquo; movement is really struggling against reaction. The workers&rsquo; movement must act against the politicians responsible for the Smith Act.</p>
