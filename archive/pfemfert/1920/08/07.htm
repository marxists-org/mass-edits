<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="fst">In April 1920, when Lenin was putting the finishing touches to 
his <i>Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder</i>, he was as yet unaware of 
the founding of the KAPD, which would reinforce his determination to liquidate a 
political tendency which seemed to him to be a denial of reality. In order not 
to lose touch with the masses, one must go wherever they are to be found. This 
is the axis around which all of the arguments in Lenin&#8217;s book revolve, making 
the book a theory of manipulation: we shall take advantage of the discord in the 
enemy&#8217;s ranks, we shall unmask the leaders of the Labour Party before the eyes 
of their membership by making proposals which they cannot fulfill, we shall use 
the space provided to us by bourgeois democracy against that democracy...</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD, through the pen of Gorter, who published his <i>Open 
Letter to Comrade Lenin</i> in July, still attempted to open up a dialogue. 
Gorter stressed the point that, unlike the situation in Russia, in the countries 
of the old bourgeoisie with deeply-rooted democratic traditions, no method could 
transform the parliaments into weapons, and one did not need to unmask a social 
democracy and a handful of trade unions which, rather than carrying out 
&#8220;betrayals&#8221;, fulfilled a precise function.</p>

<p class="fst">The <i>Open Letter</i> was an attempt to prove to the Bolsheviks 
that they were mistaken in their efforts to get the communists to imitate them 
everywhere. Gorter argued as if the KAPD had a clearer awareness of the real 
interests of the International and the Russian State than Lenin, Trotsky or 
Zinoviev. Until the middle and even until the end of 1920, the German Left 
Communists did not consider themselves to actually constitute an opposition to 
the Bolsheviks; to the contrary, it was the Spartacist leadership which seemed 
to them to be unfaithful to the principles they felt they held in common with 
the Bolsheviks. Pfemfert argues from a noticeably different position since, like 
Rühle, he rejects any positive role for a party. He does, however, just like 
Gorter but even more explicitly, argue as if a revolutionary situation was in 
the process of maturing and as if all that was needed was an adequate slogan to 
be launched by a resolute minority at the right place: the factory, &#8220;the 
reproductive cell of the new society&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">Political stabilization, which was being ever more distinctly 
established after 1920, deprived the &#8220;self-initiative&#8221; advocated by Gorter and 
Pfempfert of its practical scope. To cite just one example, contrary to the 
hopes of the supporters of an electoral boycott, abstention was of little 
account. In this confused and turbulent period, the masses were far from 
demonstrating their loathing for the ballot box, especially on the occasion of 
the elections to the Constituent Assembly which would decide upon the political 
regime to succeed the Empire (January 26, 1919). They voted in droves: 
two-and-a-half times more voters than in 1912, two-thirds of them entering the 
voting booth for the first time.</p>

<p class="fst">Gorter&#8217;s <i>Open Letter to Comrade Lenin</i> was left without any 
public refutation. It would be ten years before its first French edition saw the 
light of day, published by the Groups of Communist Workers (among whose members 
was André Prudhommeaux), and thirty-nine more years before the second French 
edition was published.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="fst">The Third International should be the association of the 
revolutionary proletariat of all countries in the fight against the dictatorship 
of capitalism, against the bourgeois State, for the power of toiling humanity, 
for communism. Having originated in a country where the workers have already, by 
great efforts, conquered this power, has helped the Third International to win 
the sympathies of the world proletariat. Enthusiasm for this new worldwide 
association of the exploited goes hand-in-hand with enthusiasm for Soviet Russia 
and for the incomparable heroic combat of the Russian proletariat. But the new 
structure of the Third International has as of yet had neither the time nor the 
opportunity to achieve moral results as an organization.</p>

<p class="fst">The Third International can and will be a moral force if it 
represents the expression of the will of the world&#8217;s revolutionary proletariat, 
and then it will be indestructible and irreplaceable as the International of the 
fighting proletarian class. But the Third International would be an 
impossibility and a vacuous phrase should it want to be the propaganda 
instrument of one or more parties.</p>

<p class="fst">If the Third International were really the association of the 
world&#8217;s revolutionary proletariat, the latter would then have the feeling of 
belonging to it, regardless of formal membership. But if the Third International 
presents itself as the instrument of the central power of a particular country, 
then it will bear within itself the seed of death and <i>it will be an obstacle 
to the world revolution</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The revolution is an affair of the proletariat as a <i>class</i>; 
the social revolution is not a <i>party</i> matter.</p>

<p class="fst">We must be yet more precise:</p>

<p class="fst">Soviet Russia will perish without the help of <i>all</i> 
revolutionary combatants. All the workers who are really class-conscious (and 
the syndicalists, for example, are also unconditionally part of this category!) 
are ready to actively come to its aid. The Third International would act in a 
criminal and counterrevolutionary manner if, in the interests of a party, it 
were to do anything which could douse the sacred fire of fraternal solidarity 
which smolders in the hearts of all proletarians for Soviet Russia (and not yet 
for the Third International as a separate organization!).</p>

<p class="fst">Is this so hard to understand? Is it folly, comrade Lenin, for us 
to shout at you: it is not we who need the Third International at this time, but 
the Third International which needs <i>us</i>?</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>II</h3>

<p class="fst">Lenin thinks that is indeed folly. In his work, <i>Left-Wing 
Communism: An Infantile Disorder</i>, which he has just launched against the 
revolutionary proletariat, Lenin thinks that the Third International must abide 
by the statutes of the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik) and that the 
revolutionary proletariat of all countries must submit to the authority of the 
&#8220;Third International&#8221; and, therefore, to the tactics of the Bolsheviks. The 
Bolsheviks should determine what arms the fighting proletariat of the rest of 
the world should use. And only those proletarians who unconditionally obey will 
be chosen to belong to this world association. In the Principles of the Second 
Congress of the Third International, Lenin has formulated this postulate in a 
yet clearer way: not only has he given general instructions, but all of the 
details of <i>tactics</i>, of <i>organization</i>, and he has even prescribed 
the <i>name</i> which should be assumed by the parties in all countries. And the 
finishing touch:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;All the decisions of the congresses of the Communist 
International, as well as of its Executive Committee, are binding on all parties 
affiliated with the Communist International.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Even if this is methodical, it is still madness!</p>

<p class="fst">In a country as small as Germany, we have repeated experience, 
most recently in March of 1920, of the fact that a tactic which leads to 
victory, for example, in the Ruhr, was impossible elsewhere; that the general 
strike of the industrial workers in central Germany was a joke for the Vogtland, 
where the proletariat has been condemned to unemployment since November 1918. 
And should Moscow be the supreme general staff for us and for all the other 
countries?</p>

<p class="fst">What draws us towards the Third International is the shared goal 
of the world revolution: the dictatorship of the proletariat, communism. The 
Third International must stand alongside the fighting proletarians of all 
countries, instructing them concerning the various situations and types of 
revolutionary civil war. The combatants would be asses instead of combatants 
were they to want to have nothing to do with the task of examining the weapons 
used by the comrades fighting here and elsewhere. But they would be sheep were 
they to fail to stop dragging themselves down roads which they had long since 
recognized to be impractical for them and which they consequently abandoned.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin&#8217;s attack against us is, in its tendency and in its details, 
simply monstrous. His text is superficial. It does not conform to the facts. It 
is unjust. Only in its phraseology does it display any hardness. Of the rigor of 
the thinker Lenin, which was ordinarily manifested in his polemics most of all, 
not a trace is to be found.</p>

<p class="fst">What does Lenin want? He wants to tell the Communist Workers 
Party of Germany (KAPD) and the revolutionary proletariat of all the other 
countries, that they are imbeciles, idiots, and, worse yet, that they are not 
docilely knuckling under to the wisdom of the <i>bonzes</i>, since they are not 
allowing themselves to be led in an extremely centralized way by Moscow (through 
its intermediaries, Radek and Levi). When Germany&#8217;s revolutionary vanguard 
rejected participation in bourgeois parliaments, when this vanguard began to 
demolish the reactionary trade union institutions, when it turned its back on 
the political parties of leaders, in accordance with the watchword, <i>the 
emancipation of the workers can only be the task of the workers themselves</i>, 
then this vanguard was composed of imbeciles, then it committed &#8220;leftist 
infantilisms&#8221;, then it necessarily had to be denied the right to join the Third 
International (this was the result of Lenin&#8217;s pamphlet)! Only when the workers 
of the KAPD return, like repentant sinners, to the Spartacus League, the sole 
bringer of salvation, will they be allowed to join the Third International. So, 
this is how it stands: Back to parliamentarism! Enter Legien&#8217;s trade unions! 
Join the KPD, that party of leaders in its death throes! This is what Lenin is 
shouting at the conscious German proletariat!</p>

<p class="fst">As I said above: a monstrous book! I must also call attention to 
the futility of the arguments which Lenin dusts off from the 1880s to persuade 
the German leftists that he knows how to employ quotation marks against them.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
All his explanations concerning centralism and parliamentarism are on the level 
of the USPD. And what Lenin writes in favor of working in the trade unions is so 
amazingly opportunist that the trade union <i>bonzes</i> have set themselves no 
more urgent task than to reproduce and distribute this section of Lenin&#8217;s work 
as a leaflet!</p>

<p class="fst">The polemic which Lenin directs at the KAPD is scandalously 
superficial and inexcusably inept. In one passage, for example, he says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In the first place, contrary to the opinion of such outstanding 
political leaders as Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, the German &#8216;Leftists&#8217;, 
as we know, considered parliamentarism to be &#8216;politically obsolete&#8217; even in 
January 1919. It is clear that the &#8216;Leftists&#8217; were mistaken. This fact alone 
utterly destroys, at a single stroke, the proposition that parliamentarism is 
&#8216;politically obsolete&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This is what the logician Lenin writes! In what way, please tell 
me, is it &#8220;clear&#8221; that we were mistaken? Perhaps in the fact that, in the 
national Constituent Assembly, Levi and Zetkin did not sit next to Crispien&#8217;s 
people?<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> Perhaps in the fact that this communist duo is now seated in the 
Reichstag? How can Lenin, so thoughtlessly and without offering even the shadow 
of proof, write that our &#8220;error&#8221; is clear and then add the assertion that &#8220;this 
alone destroys the proposition,&#8221; etc.? Monstrous! Also monstrous is the way 
Lenin responds in the affirmative to the question, &#8220;Must we participate in 
bourgeois parliaments?&#8221;:</p>

<p class="fst">&#8220;Criticism&#8212;the keenest, most ruthless and uncompromising criticism&#8212;must be directed, not against parliamentarism or parliamentary activities, but against those leaders who are unable&#8212;and still more against those who are <i>unwilling</i>&#8212;to utilize parliamentary elections and the parliamentary tribune in a revolutionary, communist manner.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">It is Lenin who writes this! Lenin suddenly wants &#8220;to utilize 
democracy&#8221;, a method with which he had settled accounts by referring to it as 
&#8220;the demand of renegades&#8221; (in <i>The State and Revolution</i>, in <i>The 
Renegade Kautsky...</i>, and in <i>Bourgeois Democracy and Proletarian 
Dictatorship</i>)!</p>

<p class="fst">The revolutionary proletariat of Germany has distanced itself 
from the &#8220;venal and corrupt parliamentarism of bourgeois society&#8221;, that &#8220;system 
of illusion and deceit&#8221;. This proletariat has fully acknowledged the battle cry: 
&#8220;All power to the councils!&#8221; It has come to understand that it cannot &#8220;utilize&#8221; 
the bourgeois parliament. It has recognized the trade unions as institutions 
which necessarily lead to a <i>community of labor</i> between exploiters and 
exploited, and for that reason alone sabotage the class struggle, and it is of 
little import whether their members should criticize this or that. The 
revolutionary proletariat of Germany has had to atone for its submission to 
leaders with hecatombs of workers corpses. The infamous Central Committee of the 
Spartacus League has destroyed that illusion. The proletariat has <i>definitely</i> 
had enough of all that!</p>

<p class="fst">And now Lenin comes along and tries to make us forget the bitter 
lessons of the German revolution as well as the lessons he has himself taught? 
Is he trying to make us forget that Marx taught that it is not individuals who 
are responsible? And that it is <i>parliamentarism</i> which must be fought and <i>
not the individual parliamentarians</i>!</p>

<p class="fst">Several months have passed since &#8220;communists&#8221; first took their 
seats in the Reichstag. Read the minutes of the parliamentary sessions, now that 
Levi-Zetkin &#8220;have utilized&#8221; this tribune &#8220;in a revolutionary, communist manner&#8221; 
(actually, no more than meaningless journalistic verbiage)! You have read the 
minutes, comrade Lenin. Where is your &#8220;keenest, most ruthless and uncompromising 
criticism&#8221;? Are you satisfied with them? ...</p>

<p class="fst">It is easy to prove: the KAPD has most effectively utilized the 
&#8220;electoral struggle&#8221; in the sense of carrying out revolutionary agitation, and 
it has been able to utilize it more effectively than the parliamentary 
communists precisely because it has no &#8220;candidates&#8221; running after electoral 
victory. The KAPD has unmasked the parliamentary scam and has brought the ideas 
of the councils to the remotest villages. But the vote-hunters have confirmed, 
during the few months of their activity in parliament, that we were right to be 
anti-parliamentary. Comrade Lenin, has the idea never occurred to you, a 
Leninist idea, that in a country with 40 years of social democracy&#8217;s 
parliamentary foolishness behind it (that party also wanted, in the beginning, 
to &#8220;utilize&#8221; that tribune solely for propaganda!), it is a totally reactionary 
act to enter parliament? Do you not understand that in a country characterized 
by parliamentary cretinism, parliamentarism <i>can only be stigmatized by means 
of the boycott</i>? There is no stigmatization more violent, none which 
penetrates more deeply into the consciousness of the workers! A parliament 
unmasked by a boycott carried out by proletarians would never be able to deceive 
and trick the proletarians. But a correct &#8220;programmatic&#8221; speech, which Clara 
Zetkin delivers with the approval of the bourgeois and social democratic 
newspapers, and from which the press takes what seems suitable, such a speech 
engenders respect in the bourgeois parliament! Had the bosses of the USPD not 
gone to the Constituent Assembly, the consciousness of the German proletarians 
would be much more developed today.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>III</h3>

<p class="fst">Lenin favors &#8220;the strictest centralization&#8221; and &#8220;iron 
discipline&#8221;. He wants the Third International to endorse his views and to eject 
all those who, like the KAPD, are critically opposed to omnipotent leadership.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin wants military-style authority to prevail in the parties of 
every country.</p>

<p class="fst">The instructions of the First Congress of the Third International 
had a somewhat different flavor! In those instructions, directed against the 
Independents whose fighting spirit was uncertain, it recommended:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... separate the revolutionary elements from the &#8216;Center&#8217;, 
something which can only be achieved by means of resolute and merciless 
criticism of the &#8216;Center&#8217;s&#8217; leaders.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">They also said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is in addition necessary to form an alliance with those 
elements of the revolutionary workers movement who, although not previously 
members of the socialist party, now stand completely on the terrain of the 
proletarian dictatorship in its soviet form, that is, first of all with the 
syndicalist elements of the workers movement.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">But now a different tactic prevails. Instead, the slogan is: Down 
with the syndicalists! Down with the &#8220;idiots&#8221; who do not submit to the <i>bonzes</i>! 
The Executive Committee is in command, and its orders are the law.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin thought he could quote Karl Liebknecht against the 
&#8220;Leftists&#8221;. I shall quote Karl Liebknecht <i>against Lenin</i>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The vicious circle in which the big centralized organizations 
operate, provided with functionaries who collect their salaries and who are 
quite well-paid considering their social background, consists not only in the 
fact that these organizations are creating, in this professional bureaucracy, a 
social layer directly hostile to the revolutionary interests of the proletariat, 
but also in the fact that they confer power upon a leader, who easily becomes a 
tyrant and is chosen from among those who have a violent interest in opposing 
the revolutionary politics of the proletariat, while the independence, the will, 
the initiative and the moral and intellectual autonomous action of the masses 
are repressed or completely eliminated. The paid parliamentarians also belong to 
this bureaucracy.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There is but one remedy, on the organizational plane, for this 
evil: suppression of the paid bureaucracy or else its exclusion from all 
decision-making, and the limitation of its activity to technical administrative 
work. Prohibition of the re-election of all functionaries after a certain term 
of office, which shall be established in accordance with the availability of 
proletarians who have in the meantime become experts in technical 
administration; the possibility of revoking their mandates at any time; 
limitation of the purview of the various offices; decentralization; the 
consultation of all members in regard to important questions (veto or 
referendum). In the election of functionaries the greatest importance should 
attach to the proofs they offer concerning their determination and readiness in 
revolutionary action, of their revolutionary fighting spirit, of their spirit of 
boundless sacrifice in the active commitment of their existence. The education 
of the masses and of each individual in intellectual and moral autonomy, in 
their capacity to question authority, in their own resolute self-initiative, in 
the unrestrained readiness and capacity for action, in general constitute the 
only basis to guarantee the development of a workers movement equal to its 
historical tasks, and also comprise the essential conditions for extirpating the 
dangers of bureaucracy.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Every form of organization which obstructs the education in an 
international revolutionary spirit, the autonomous capacity for action and the 
initiative of the revolutionary masses must be rejected... No obstacle to free 
initiative. The educational task most urgently needed in Germany, a country of 
blind, passive, mass obedience, is to favor this initiative among the masses; 
and this problem must be resolved even at the risk of being exposed to the 
danger that, momentarily, all &#8216;discipline&#8217; and all the &#8216;solid organizations&#8217; 
might all go down the drain (!). The individual must be given a margin of 
freedom much larger than he has been attributed with until the present by 
tradition in Germany. No importance at all must be conceded to the profession of 
faith in words. All the dispersed radical elements will fuse into a determined 
whole in accordance with the immanent laws of internationalism if intransigence 
is practiced towards all opportunists and tolerance is practiced towards all the 
efforts made on behalf of a revolutionary fighting spirit in the process of 
fermentation.&#8221;</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="fst">I know that Lenin has not become a &#8220;renegade&#8221; or a social 
democrat, although <i>Left-Wing Communism...</i> has a purely social democratic 
effect (the German leaders were saying almost exactly the same things in 1878). 
How, then, can the publication of this text against the world revolution be 
explained?</p>

<p class="fst">The monarchists have the custom, in order to excuse the 
stupidities (or the crimes) of their monarchs, of always alleging that their 
majesties were &#8220;misinformed&#8221;. Revolutionaries <i>cannot</i> (they do not have 
the right to) make such an excuse. We are well aware, of course, that Karl Radek 
and the Spartacus League, in order to divert Lenin&#8217;s attention from the causes 
of their political failure, have <i>purposefully</i> told him lies about the 
situation and the revolutionary proletariat in Germany. The insolent letter 
directed by Karl Radek at the members of the KAPD shows just how things have 
been presented to comrade Lenin. But this by no means excuses Lenin! In any 
event, such exculpation is useless: the fact remains that Lenin, with his stupid 
pamphlet, has complicated the struggle of the revolutionary proletariat in 
Germany, although he has not abolished that struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">It is true that Lenin has been shamelessly lied to about the 
affairs of the Spartacus League and the KAPD, but he should have nonetheless 
said that it is a serious error to identify the German situation with the 
Russian situation. Lenin was perfectly capable, despite Radek, of seeing the 
difference between the German trade unions, which have <i>always</i> led a 
counterrevolutionary existence, and the Russian trade unions. Lenin knew 
perfectly well that the Russian revolutionaries did not have to fight against 
parliamentary cretinism because parliament had neither a tradition nor any 
credit among the Russian proletariat. Lenin knew (or should have known) that in 
Germany the leaders of the party and the trade unions <i>necessarily brought on</i> 
the 4<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> of August 1914 by &#8220;utilizing&#8221; parliament! That the 
authoritarian and militaristic character of the party, accompanied by blind 
obedience, has stifled the revolutionary forces in the German workers movement 
for decades. Lenin should have considered all of these things before undertaking 
his battle against the &#8220;Leftists&#8221;. Had he done so, a sense of responsibility 
would have prevented Lenin from writing this unforgivable pamphlet.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>V</h3>

<p class="fst">To convince the world proletariat that <i>Left-Wing Communism...</i> 
indicates the right road to the revolution for <i>every</i> country, Lenin 
presents the road which the Bolsheviks followed and which led to their victory, 
because it was (and is) the <i>right</i> road.</p>

<p class="fst">Here as well, Lenin finds himself in a completely untenable 
position. When he cites the victory of the Bolsheviks as proof that his party 
had worked &#8220;correctly&#8221; during the fifteen years of its existence, he is 
hallucinating! <i>The victory of the Bolsheviks in November 1917 was not due 
solely to the revolutionary strength of the party! The Bolsheviks took power and 
achieved victory thanks to the bourgeois-pacifist slogan of &#8220;Peace&#8221;!</i> Only 
this slogan defeated the national-Mensheviks, and allowed the Bolsheviks to win 
over the army to their side!</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, it is not their victory in and of itself which can convince 
us that the Bolsheviks worked &#8220;correctly&#8221; in the sense of maintaining the 
firmness of their principles. It is instead the fact that they know how to 
defend this victory now, after almost three years!</p>

<p class="fst">But&#8212;and this is a question posed by the &#8220;Leftists&#8221;&#8212;have the 
Bolsheviks always run their party dictatorship in the way that Lenin demands, in <i>
Left-Wing Communism...</i>, that the revolutionary proletariat of Germany should 
run their party? Or has the situation of the Bolsheviks been such that they did 
not need to abide by Lenin&#8217;s &#8220;condition&#8221;, who demands that the revolutionary 
party &#8220;be able to <i>mix with</i>, to <i>fraternize with</i> and, if it so 
desires, to a certain extent to <i>unite with</i> the <i>broadest masses</i> of 
the workers, primarily with the proletarian masses, but <i>also</i> with the <i>
non-proletarian</i> masses&#8221; (<i>Left-Wing Communism...</i>).</p>

<p class="fst">Until now, the Bolsheviks have been capable of putting into 
practice, and have only succeeded in putting into practice, one thing: the 
strict military discipline of the party, the &#8220;iron&#8221; dictatorship of party 
centralism. Have they been able to &#8220;mix with, fraternize with, and, if [they] so 
[desire], to a certain extent to unite with&#8221; the &#8220;broadest masses&#8221; of which 
Lenin speaks?</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>VI</h3>

<p class="fst">The tactics employed by the Russian comrades are their business. 
We protested, and had to treat Mr. Kautsky as a counterrevolutionary, when he 
allowed himself to slander the tactics of the Bolsheviks. We must defer to the 
Russian comrades in the matter of their choice of weapons. But we do know one 
thing: <i>in Germany, a party dictatorship is impossible</i>; in Germany, only a <i>
class</i> dictatorship, the dictatorship of the revolutionary workers councils, <i>
is capable</i> of victory (and it will be victorious!), and (what is most 
important) will be able to <i>defend</i> its victory.</p>

<p class="fst">I could now write, following Lenin&#8217;s recipe in <i>Left-Wing 
Communism...</i>, that this &#8220;is clear&#8221;, and then change the subject. But we do 
not need to evade the question.</p>

<p class="fst">The German proletariat is organized in different political 
parties which are parties of leaders with distinctly authoritarian 
characteristics. The reactionary trade unions, controlled by the trade union 
bureaucracy due to the strictly centralized nature of their structures, are in 
favor of &#8220;democracy&#8221; and the recovery of the capitalist world, without which 
they could not exist. A <i>party</i> dictatorship in this Germany means: workers 
against workers (the Noske<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> era began with the party dictatorship of the 
SPD!). A KPD-Spartacus League party dictatorship (and Lenin proposes no other 
kind!) would have to be imposed <i>against</i> the <i>workers</i> of the USPD, 
the <i>workers</i> of the SPD, the trade unions, the syndicalists, and the 
Factory Organizations, as well as against the bourgeoisie. Karl Liebknecht <i>
never</i> aspired to such a <i>party</i> dictatorship with the Spartacus League, 
as the whole corpus of his revolutionary work demonstrates (and as is shown in 
the passages I quoted above).</p>

<p class="fst">It is incontestable that all the workers (including the workers 
at the beck and call of Legien and Scheidemann!<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a>) must be supporters of the 
new communist order, providing their internal divisions do not render the 
repression of the bourgeoisie impossible. Are we to await the last judgment, 
when all the proletarians, or even only a few million of them, are members of 
the KPD (which is today composed of no more than a handful of employees and a 
small number of people of good faith)? Perhaps the Third International will be 
the inducement that will oblige the revolutionary workers to enter the KPD (as 
Karl Radek and Mr. Levi have imagined)? Can the egoism of its leaders remain 
ignorant of the fact that, at this very moment, the <i>majority</i> of the 
industrial workers and the rural proletariat is <i>mature</i> and ready to be 
won over to a <i>class</i> dictatorship?</p>

<p class="fst">We need a slogan for summoning the German proletariat to <i>unite</i>. 
We possess it: &#8220;All power to the workers councils!&#8221;. We need a place for 
recruitment where all the class-conscious workers can meet without the 
interference of party <i>bonzes</i>. We have such a place: <i>it is the 
workplace</i>. The workplace, the reproductive cell of the new community, is 
also the base for recruitment. For the victorious realization of the proletarian 
revolution in Germany, we do not need <i>bonzes</i>, but conscious proletarians. 
Those who currently call themselves syndicalists or independents, share with us 
the goal of destroying the capitalist State and realizing the communist human 
community and therefore they are part of us, and we shall &#8220;mix with, fraternize 
with and unite with&#8221; them in the revolutionary Factory Organizations!</p>

<p class="fst">The Communist Workers Party is not, therefore, a party in the bad 
sense of the word, because it is not an end in itself! It makes propaganda for 
the dictatorship in its sense of the word, because this dictatorship <i>is not 
an end in itself</i>! It makes propaganda for the dictatorship of the 
proletariat, for communism. It trains its combatants in the Factory 
Organizations, where all the forces that will abolish capitalism, establish the 
power of the councils and permit the construction of the new communist economy 
are concentrated. The Factory Organizations are brought together in the <i>Union</i>. 
The Factory Organizations will know how to guarantee the rule of the proletariat 
as a <i>class</i> against all the manipulations of the party bosses, against all 
traitors. <i>Only the power of the class</i> provides a broad and firm 
foundation (as capitalism proves!).</p>

<p class="fst">The Communist Workers Party of Germany has had to endure Lenin&#8217;s <i>
Left-Wing Communism...</i>, Radek&#8217;s maledictions, and the calumnies of the 
Spartacus League and all the parties of leaders, because it is fighting for the 
class rule of the proletariat, because it shares Karl Liebknecht&#8217;s views 
concerning centralism. The KAPD will quite well survive <i>Left-Wing 
Communism...</i> and everything else. And, whether or not Karl Radek understands 
this, and whether or not Lenin writes a pamphlet against us (and against 
himself): the proletarian revolution in Germany will take different paths than 
in Russia. When Lenin treats us as &#8220;imbeciles&#8221; it is not us but he himself who 
is the target, since in this matter it is we who are the <i>Leninists</i>. We 
know this for a fact: even if national or international congresses prescribe the 
most detailed itineraries for the world revolution, it will nevertheless follow 
the course imposed by history! Even if the Second Congress of the Third 
International pronounces a judgment condemning the KAPD in favor of a party of 
leaders, the revolutionary communists of Germany will know how to easily deal 
with this and will not whine about it like the <i>bonzes</i> of the USPD. We are 
part of the Third International, because the Third International is not Moscow, 
it is not Lenin, it is not Radek, it is the world proletariat fighting for its 
liberation!</p>
