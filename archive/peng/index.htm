<p>[Peng Shuzi and Chen Pilan]</p>
<p class="information">Peng Shuzi joined the Socialist Youth League in
1920 and then attended the University of the Toilers of the East in
Moscow. At the time, Karl Radek was the chief Administrator of that
institution. Joining the Chinese Communist Party in 1923 while still in
Moscow, he ended up being elected to the Political Bureau of the CCP by
1925. Opposing the disastrous Comintern policies imposed on the CCP by
Moscow, he joined with Chen Duxiue, the founder of the CCP, in becoming
supporters of the Left Opposition because of his agreement with the LO
line and its critique of the Chinese Revolution.</p>

<p class="information">
Peng spent 5 years in a Guomintang (Chinese Nationalist) prison and was
freed in 1937. Maintaining an underground presence against both
Guomintang and the CCP on the one side and organizing against the
Japanese occupation on the other, Peng contributed to the building of
the underground communist opposition in occupied China. After the war
and these Trotskyists started recruiting, Peng fled to Hong Kong ahead
of the CCP repression. He was then able to be the key correspondent for
the Fourth International by reporting on the repression of the Chinese
Trotskyists during the 1951-1953 period when Mao&#8217;s forces destroyed all
independent workers organizations under the cover of the US assault on
the Korean peninsula.</p>
