<hr class="section" />
<h3>About the author</h3>

<p class="fst">Tony Cliff was born in Palestine in 1917, the year of the Russian Revolution. In the 1930s he became a revolutionary socialist and a follower of Leon Trotsky. After working to build a small revolutionary group in Palestine, he came to Britain after the Second World War. He broke from orthodox Trotskyism after undertaking an extensive study of the Soviet Union&#8217;s Eastern European satellites.</p>

<p>He founded the Socialist Review Group, which became the International Socialists in the 1960s and the Socialist Workers Party in the 1970s. He wrote many books including a three volume biography of Lenin and a four volume biography of Trotsky. He died in April 2000 shortly before the publication of his autobiography, <strong>A World to Win: Life of a Revolutionary</strong>.</p>

<p>These essays were written in the last year of his life for revolutionary socialist organisations in Germany and Turkey. They are published here for the first time in English. The publishers would like to thank Cliff&#8217;s comrade, companion and wife Chanie Rosenberg for her invaluable help in putting the collection together.</p>
