<h1>Rosa Luxemburg</h1>

<hr class="section" />
<h3>Foreword</h3>

<p class="fst">On 15 January 1919 a soldier&#8217;s rifle butt smashed the skull of Rosa Luxemburg, revolutionary genius, fighter and thinker. A personification of the unity of theory and practice, Rosa Luxemburg&#8217;s life and work require a description of her activities as well as her thoughts &#8211; they are inseparable. In the framework of a pamphlet, however, one cannot hope to do justice to both. In trying to avoid falling between two stools, this pamphlet concentrates mainly on Rosa Luxemburg&#8217;s ideas, as they contain her main permanent contribution to the international socialist movement.</p>

<p>Little of her writing has been translated into English. It is, therefore, useful to give as varied a selection from her work (largely translated from the original German) as possible.</p>

<p>A scientific socialist, whose motto was &#8220;doubt all&#8221;, Rosa Luxemburg could have wished for nothing better than a critical evaluation of her own work. The present essay is written in a spirit of admiration and criticism of its subject.</p>
