<p class="fst"><strong>Tony Cliff</strong> added that although the decision in Manchester was very good, this would not be the general picture. The position of non-implementation was lost in Hackney and Liverpool. The problem lies in the gap between industrial struggle and community struggle, although this has been narrowed by the new militancy shown in the strikes over the summer.</p>

<p>Recognising this problem is important as the struggle against the tax will be a long term one in which it is still difficult to argue for the correct strategy. Nevertheless, we have to insist on the importance of industrial action since individual non-payment can't win in the long term.</p>
