<h3>The Labour Party</h3>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h1>18. Conclusion</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">THE LABOUR Party today is a reformist organisation that cannot
deliver reforms, only destroy them. It is committed to electoralism
but is reducing its base of committed voters, eliminating its
activist cadre and more and becoming more dependent on grabbing votes
and members by occupying Tory territory. The political conclusions
that flow from these points are clear.</p>

<p>Labour and reformism cannot emancipate the working class. The
Labour Party cannot be changed into a force for socialism. It is
controlled by a social stratum &#8211; the labour bureaucracy &#8211; whose
root interests are opposed to those of the working class. This group
works through the system rather than against it. Therefore the Labour
Party is, to use Lenin&#8217;s phrase, an agent of capitalism within the
working class movement.</p>

<p>Does this mean that Labour&#8217;s reformism has no future? Far from
it. Reformist consciousness &#8211; the ideas of the ruling class
modified by the experience of exploitation and oppression &#8211; is not
dependent on the actual prospect of winning reforms, of voting Labour
or being a party member. So reformist beliefs continue.</p>

<p>Despite Labour becoming increasingly less capable of channelling
these aspirations it does not mean that other organisations can
easily displace the party as the political expression of reformism.
Although modified, Labour&#8217;s unique relationship with the trade
union bureaucracy continues and gives it an inherent stability.
Similarly the very indirect, but nevertheless real link between the
consciousness and the Labour vote guarantees the party&#8217;s mass
influence. Labour may temporarily attract right wing support, but its
core support is the working class, its most advanced section being
overwhelmingly committed to Labourism.</p>

<p>Whether Labour succeeds next time or not, the key issue for
socialists is never the polling booth (since parliaments change
things very little) but the state of the working class movement. The
death of social reform, electoral defeat, and destruction of Labour&#8217;s
activists has in every case strengthened the hold of the Party over
the movement.</p>

<p>Labour can survive as reformism without reforms. In the 1960s and
1970s, apart from at election times, Labour was irrelevant to day to
day struggles on the shop-floor. Today, however, the bureaucracy&#8217;s
New Labour ideology subordinates every aspect to the requirements of
the parliamentary game. It is the dominant influence in all areas.
Only exceptionally do spontaneous outbursts of anger escape its restraints.</p>

<p>But conventional politics is becoming ever more volatile. For
decades the Italian Socialist Party was a key player in the state.
Now it has been wiped out by corruption charges. Canada&#8217;s Tories
were in government one day, reduced to two MPs the next, and made a
partial recovery shortly afterwards. Yeltsin was the hero of the
moment and is now detested by all. &#8216;Communist&#8217; regimes fell in
Eastern Europe only to be re-elected soon after. A Blair government
can come to power and be swept away just as easily. However, this is
merely political froth on the surface of a society based on the
permanent antagonism of an exploiting ruling class and the mass of
the population.</p>

<p>For this reason, reformism will not disappear spontaneously, no
matter how inadequate it is to the current needs of the working
class. This applies with even greater force when the capitalist
crisis brings about major working class struggles in the future.
True, it is through such struggles that the mass of workers can learn
to go beyond reformism. But history shows that large scale conflict
provides only the potential for this to happen.</p>

<p>One recent example was the mass strike and demonstration movement
in France. This shook the Juppe government to its foundations forcing
it into major concessions. In some areas the unofficial
&#8216;co-ordinations&#8217; of rank and file workers showed the potential
for the struggle to escape the control of the labour bureaucracy.
Economic demands began to combine with political demands for the
withdrawal of Juppe&#8217;s plan to destroy the French welfare state.
However, the movement has, for the moment, been contained by
concessions and by the labour bureaucracy. As <strong>Socialist Review</strong>
puts it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">part of the nature of mass strikes is that ... they can
gather momentum but at a certain stage the action begins to pose the
question of power. Can the movement bring down the government and if
so who will rule? Either the movement presses forward, leading to a
revolutionary situation, or it begins to stall ... The movement has
raised the spontaneous demands and slogans which can lead to
generalisation, but they have not been accompanied by the political
confidence which the workers&#8217; movement needs. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">France&#8217;s recent events have only begun the process of
revolutionary upsurge which shifts the vast majority to the left. In
the first instance this moves the largest number from passively
thinking little or no change is possible to the nearest political
position &#8211; left reformism. This does not imply actual membership of
a reformist organisation, but acceptance of its political ideas. As
we saw during 1918&#8211;1920 and 1972&#8211;74, Labour is perfectly ready to
adjust its rhetoric quickly in order to occupy this left reformist
ground. The initial impact of successful class struggles is thus to
revive the Labour left. A relatively smaller number will move to
centrist positions and still fewer will be won to revolutionary
socialist politics. In the example of the German revolution in 1919,
the reformist SPD grew enormously, the centrist USPD a little less
so, and Luxemburg&#8217;s Communist Party grew from nothing to just a few thousand.</p>

<p>The main problem for revolutionary socialists is not what happens
on day one of an upsurge of struggle, but political developments
thereafter. Are the revolutionaries sufficiently strong to have their
arguments heard so as to win the majority to go beyond reformism to
putting an end to capitalist society?</p>

<p>To be able to carry out such a task preparations must begin long
before. The necessary starting point is an independent Marxist party
which first of all clearly and openly puts forward the alternative to
reformism and, secondly, emphasises the collective potential of the
working class. To do either effectively it must be outside the Labour
Party and the parliamentary dead end.</p>

<p>This is merely the first step. Although every socialists counts,
few can be won by argument alone. They must be convinced in practice.
It is through struggle that large numbers can discover through their
own experience that revolution is the only way forward. In other
words revolutionaries must propose joint activity with reformists
and, by working alongside them, wean them away from belief in the
Labour Party road. Even if calls for joint activity on immediate
issues fail, this can show how reformists put their sectional
interests above the needs of the wider movement. Revolutionaries work
simultaneously with and against reformists.</p>

<p>The supreme example of this was Russia in the summer of 1917. In
July the reformist parties, the Mensheviks and Social
Revolutionaries, drove the Bolsheviks underground and jailed many of
the leaders for arguing for socialist revolution. At this time the
Bolsheviks were a minority in the working class and the reformists a
majority. A month later General Kornilov attempted a reactionary
coup. To defend the gains made so far the Bolsheviks united with the
very Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries who had just persecuted
them. By leading the battle against Kornilov they won the allegiance
of the majority of Russian workers and opened the way to soviet power
in October.</p>

<p>Of course Britain in 1996 hardly presents such possibilities. But
the advent of a Blair government, combining soaring expectations and
years of growing frustration over mass unemployment and decaying
public services means that revolutionaries may have an opportunity to
relate to the mass of reformists in practical struggle. Whether
formally organised or not, the Bolshevik tactic of the united front,
remains valid. Addressing the Communists in the 1920s Trotsky summed
up the necessary approach:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We broke with the reformists and centrists in order to
obtain complete freedom in criticising perfidy, betrayal, indecision
and the half way spirit in the labour movement. For this reason any
sort of organisational agreement which restricts our freedom of
criticism and agitation is absolutely unacceptable to us. We
participate in a united front but do not for a single moment become
dissolved in it. It is precisely in the course of struggle that the
broad masses must learn from experience that we fight better than the
others, that we see more clearly than the others, that we are more
audacious and resolute. In this way, we shall bring closer the hour
of the united revolutionary front under the undisputed Communist
leadership. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The edifice of capitalism is rotten and crumbling. If it is not
demolished it will cave in upon all of us. The reappearance of mass
Nazi movements that thrive on despair shows that humanity once again
faces the long term prospect of socialism or barbarism. In Britain
the main political obstacle in the way of demolishing capitalism is
the Labour Party. To win the working class we must get past the
obstacle.</p>
