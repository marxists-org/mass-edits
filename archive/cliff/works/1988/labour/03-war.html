<h3>The Labour Party</h3>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h1>3. War and Reconstruction &#8211;<br/>
Labour adopts Socialism</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">SINCE LABOUR is concerned with winning reforms through the
&#8216;ordinary&#8217; channels and in &#8216;normal&#8217; circumstances, great
serial crises such as war seem to have no relevance to a party
concerned with the humdrum business of legislative change. The
contrary is true. Firstly it is only during crisis that capitalism is
weakened and large-scale change in workers&#8217; consciousness is
possible. Secondly, just as a heart condition may remain hidden until
sudden stress brings it out, so periods of crisis test political
parties and reveal their inner nature. The 1914&#8211;18 war was one such
test for Labour.</p>

<p>When the First World War began Labour was a sickly infant. When it
ended an extraordinary transformation had recurred. The party was
relaunched as the chief opposition force with prospects of office.
Most remarkable of all, on its masthead was inscribed Clause Four,
the commitment to socialism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">To secure for the producers by hand or by brain the full
fruits of their industry, and the most equitable distribution thereof
that may be possible, upon the basis of the common ownership of the
means of production and the best obtainable system of popular
administration and control of each industry and service.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>An early casualty of the fighting</h4>

<p class="fst">At the outbreak of war the national element in the reformist
class/nation mix brutally asserted itself. When MacDonald, as party
leader, voiced doubts about the conflict he was deposed by the
patriotic trade union bureaucracy and replaced by Arthur Henderson.
On 19 May 1915, the party joined Asquith&#8217;s coalition government.</p>
<p>The ILP leaders who had fought for a separate Labour Party now
watched it crumble. MacDonald recorded that Hardie was: &#8216;a crushed
man [following] the complete mergence of the labour Party in the
war-lusty crowd. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> MacDonald himself
believed that coalition &#8216;jeopardised the existence of the Labour
Party&#8217; and concluded &#8216;that our Labour Party is finally burst.&#8217; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p>The Labour Party, along with countless workers&#8217; lives, had been
sacrificed. The figure of one in every ten British men aged under 45
killed or wounded was more than a statistic. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a>
Rosa Luxemburg, writing six weeks after the outbreak, counted the
cost of abandoning internationalism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the cannon fodder that was loaded upon the trains in
August and September is rotting on the battlefields of Belgium and
the Vosges, while profits are springing like weeds, from the fields
of the dead ... Shamed, dishonoured, wading in blood and dripping
with filth, thus capitalist society stands ... as a roaring beast, as
an orgy of anarchy, as a pestilential breath devastating culture and
humanity. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">By the end of four years the beast had devoured some 15 million lives.</p>

<p>In this situation, did labour movement leaders call for workers to
die for profits, or did they call on them to destroy the system that
made such carnage inevitable? Speaking for the union bureaucrats who
now controlled the party, Tillett said: &#8216;In a strike I am for my
class, right or wrong; in a war I am for my country, right or wrong.&#8217; <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p>The attitude of workers&#8217; leaders at this juncture was of
tremendous importance. Twentieth century wars have, unlike previous
ones, mobilised the entire capitalist economy in their prosecution.
Workers were therefore not only required to sacrifice themselves on
the battlefields, production at home was central to keeping the
conflict going.</p>

<p>Lloyd George, soon to be prime minister and &#8216;architect of
victory&#8217;, well understood the situation:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Of all the problems which governments had to handle
during the Great War, the most delicate and probably the most
perilous were those arising on the home front ... <em>industrial
unrest spelt a graver menace to our endurance and ultimate victory
than even the military strength of Germany</em>. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The dubious credit for keeping our ruling class secure must go to
the Labour Party and union leaders. But it was a close thing. Thus
during a rationing crisis the Food Controller told J.R. Clynes, the
ILP member of parliament then attached to his office: &#8216;It might
well be, Clynes, that you and I, at this moment, are all that stand
between this country and revolution!&#8217; <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Moralism and Labour politics</h4>

<p class="fst">War forced Labour to clarify its ideas. Before that, wrote
Desmond: &#8216;We were never very clear about anything. We did not say
we were for or against country &#8211; we simply sidestepped it.&#8217; <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p>This was not the full story. The pre-war Labour Party had a
position; or rather, the ILP, whose task was to define <em>general</em>
reformist politics, had a position. This derived from two sources.
The first was traditional &#8216;little Englandism&#8217; or the Gladstonian
idea that Britain should not become embroiled in foreign wars because
this disrupted free trade. <a href="#na" name="fa">[1*]</a> The
second source was the International <a href="#nb" name="fb">[2*]</a>,
whose famous resolution of 1907 called for &#8216;the working classes and
their parliamentary representatives to exert every effort in order to
prevent [the outbreak of war] ... In case war should break out anyway
... to intervene for its speedy termination.&#8217; Keir Hardie even
contributed to discussions with the suggestion of a general strike to
prevent war. <a href="#nc" name="fc">[3*]</a></p>

<p>Thus there was a strong element of tokenism, of mouthing a slogan
rather than intending to carry it out.</p>

<p>Secondly, because the notion of a strike touched the unions
directly, their leaders made a rare foray into foreign policy, and
defeated the suggestion of a general strike against war.</p>
<p>However when labour MPs and the Second International leaders
referred to internationalism they were not talking as Marxists. The
former never had been Marxists, the latter had ceased to be. Marxists
see <em>the world unity of the working class as a fundamental
principle without which the socialist goal cannot be reached.
</em>Reformists, however, believe <em>that it is possible to attain
socialism within one country by the control of parliament.</em> They
do not see an indissoluble link between internationalism and workers&#8217; power.</p>

<p>For reformists, <em>internationalism was an ptional extra,</em>
welcome on moral grounds but expendable. This political moralism had
been the norm in Britain with its &#8216;ethical socialist&#8217; tradition.
In war-time it enabled the ILP pacifists to remain within the Labour
Party and to turn the other cheek to the chauvinists knowing that
after the war differences would be forgotten in the common scramble
for office.</p>

<p>In August 1914 this type of internationalism was tested. On 2
August, as the war clouds gathered, Hardie and Henderson presented
this manifesto to a Trafalgar Square demonstration:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Compel those of the governing class ... to respect the
decision of the overwhelming majority of the people who will have
neither part nor lot in such infamy ... Down with class rule! Down
with the rule of brute force! Down with war! Up with the peaceful
rule of the people! <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Resolve crumbled at the first challenge. By 5 August MacDonald had
resigned and the Party had repudiated the manifesto. Only the ILP
stood its ground to the end. It said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Out of the darkness and the depth we hail our
working-class comrades of every land. Across the roar of guns, we
send sympathy and greeting to the German Socialists. They have
laboured unceasingly to promote good relations with Britain, as we
with Germany. They are no enemies of ours but faithful friends.
<a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The meaning of the split</h4>

<p class="fst">The party split. On the one side were the trade union leaders
(many of whom were MPs) and on the other five ILP MPs who supported
the initial anti-war position. The minority included MacDonald &#8211;
the former party leader, Hardie &#8211; its revered elder statesman and
Snowden &#8211; its financial expert. The trade union bureaucracy had not
only split the Labour Alliance, but overthrown the old PLP leadership.</p>

<p>What did this signify? Until 1914 do-it-yourself reformism from
below had pushed the union bureaucrats to the left. The ILP leaders,
mesmerised by parliament, were on the right. However in war union
sectionalism was incapable of withstanding patriotic hysteria. Only
the ILP which specialised in general reformist politics, stuck to its
ground, and this now placed it on the left. So today, the local
Labour MP may oppose strikes, but be more progressive on general
questions such as hanging or racism. <em>Trade unionists can
often be militant when it comes to their own workplace, but hold
backward ideas in general.</em></p>

<p>Finally, the fact that the union bureaucracy had ousted the
professional politicians showed the complexity of Party/labour
movement relations. <em>The PLP does not always dictate.</em></p>

<p>As Drucker argues, the Labour Party is not &#8216;a parliamentary
grouping united by interest or disposition to which a mass party base
was added &#8211; as is the case in the Tory Party ... It was formed to
defend in Parliament the interests of already existing institutions.&#8217;
<a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a> Thus the trade union bureaucracy
can at certain times impose its wishes, and Labour conferences,
unlike Tory Party conferences, are not purely rubber stamps for the
leadership, although they never control the leadership.</p>

<p>The Tory Party is run entirely from the top downwards. Questions
of policy, of who is the leader and so on, are made behind closed
doors. It has been described as an &#8216;oligarchy tempered by
assassination&#8217;. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a> <em>Labour is
tied to an extra-parliamentary movement.</em> The war crisis showed
that the PLP is, in a sense, a superstructure erected on a base,
which is the trade union bureaucracy. <a href="#nd" name="fd">[4*]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The diverse attitudes to war</h4>

<p class="fst">Labour gave considerable assistance to the war effort. For
example, Henderson arranged the 1915 &#8216;Treasury Agreement&#8217;, by
which the unions abandoned many of their defences, including the
right to strike. Labour MPs and union officials took an active part
in recruiting drives and efforts to raise production. One enthusiast
was Lieutenant-Colonel Will Thorne of the West Ham Volunteer Force &#8211;
a sad contrast to the new unionist fighter of 1889.</p>

<p>Furthermore the bureaucracy took an active part in hounding the
pacifist ILP. For the first, but not the last time, members of the
Labour Party sent other members to prison for their political views.
Arthur Hayday, former SDF councillor, now president of the Nottingham
Trades Council and shortly to be a Labour MP, was described by the
local press in glowing terms: &#8216;On the [Military] Tribunals no one
was more prompt in unmasking any shirker who masqueraded as a
&#8220;conchie&#8221;&#8217; (a pejorative term for conscientious objector). <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a>
When Tillett met anti-war protesters &#8216;he goaded them, he lashed and
slashed and gashed them with flaying scorn, he mocked them, he
reviled them, he laughed at them.&#8217; <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a>
Havelock Wilson, the Seamen&#8217;s leader, was moved to tears at the
ILP&#8217;s call for a negotiated peace: &#8216;some of you would be content
to meet these men! You would take the bloodstained hands of murderers
within your own.&#8217; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>So strong was Havelock Wilson&#8217;s hatred of pacifism that at the
1916 Trades Union Congress the transport workers&#8217; delegation moved
a motion which would have dissolved the Labour Alliance: &#8216;This
Congress ... should take the necessary steps to effectively control
and concentrate Trade Union political action through the Trades Union
Congress only.&#8217; <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a> The proposal
fell, but other steps were taken.</p>

<p>The 1917 Labour Party conference changed election procedures for
its national executive. Instead of the socialist societies chasing
their representatives on their own, block votes would elect the
entire executive as one body. In other words the unions could dictate
which socialist society representatives would get on. Also no
affiliated body with a membership less than 50,000 could nominate to
the executive. ILP membership was less than this. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p>The ILP was also attacked elsewhere. Out of 1,191 trials, of
objectors, 805 were ILP members <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a>
and 70 died in detention through mistreatment. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p>Deep though the division was, the Labour Party did not break up.
The German SPD, by contrast, split three ways, forming the &#8216;Majority&#8217;
Socialists, the Independents and the Spartakists. The majority of
Continental &#8216;Socialist&#8217; parties went the same way so that after
the war there emerged the Second, Third and for a short period the
&#8216;Two-and-a Half&#8217; Internationals.</p>

<p>The British Labour Party survived partly because the vast bulk of
its support came via the trade unions. This gave it <em>a
stability based not on political considerations but on economic
ones</em> since trade unions encompass a range of opinions from
reactionary to revolutionary. Another factor was, despite all the
furore, the remarkably narrow gulf separating the ILP from the majority.</p>

<p>Only the British Socialist Party <a href="#ne" name="fe">[5*]</a>,
which affiliated to Labour 1916 and included John Maclean, protested
against the war on clear internationalist grounds. But even the BSP
did not approach Lenin&#8217;s extreme position of &#8216;revolutionary defeatism&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Present-day socialism will remain true to itself only if
it joins neither one nor the other imperialist bourgeoisie, only if
it says that the two sides are &#8216;both worse&#8217;, and if it wishes the
defeat of the imperialist bourgeoisie in every country. Any other
decision will, in reality, be national-liberal and have nothing in
common with genuine internationalism.</p>

<p class="fst">This attitude had no trace of moralism, the idea that war or peace
was somehow above the class divisions of capitalist society. Lenin
therefore never considered the ILP&#8217;s idea of conscientious
objection. This was an individual not a collective act and therefore
ineffective. But more important, Lenin was very much in favour of war
&#8211; the war of workers against the system:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Not &#8216;peace without annexations&#8217;, but peace to the
cottages, war on the palaces, peace to the proletariat and working
people, war on the bourgeoisie. Socialists cannot, without ceasing to
be socialists, be opposed to all war ... civil war is just as much a
war as any other. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The limits of the ILP position</h4>

<p class="fst">There were four main currents in the Independent Labour Party. The
first was unashamedly pro-war. J.R. Clynes and James Parker actually
took office in the wartime coalition government. <a href="#nf" name="ff">[6*]</a>
The most important group was centred on the Union of Democratic
Control (UDC) which represented a coalition of ILP members and
Liberals such as E.D. Morel and Arthur Ponsonby. Next came the No
Conscription Fellowship of Fenner Brockway and Clifford Allen.
Finally, there was the Clyde ILP.</p>

<p>The UDC was led by Ramsay MacDonald, whose opposition to war was
strangely phrased:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Victory must therefore be ours. England is not played
out, her mission is not accomplished ... Well, we cannot go back, nor
can we turn to the right or to the left. We must go straight through
... the young men of the country must, for the moment settle the
immediate issue of victory, let them do it in the spirit of the brave
men who have crowned our country with honour in times that have gone.
Whoever may be in the wrong, men so inspired will be in the right. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Where, you might ask, is the anti-war position in that? The answer
is that MacDonald believed the interests of the British state were
ill-served by the war. Diplomatic intrigues and imperial ambitions
had created unnecessary conflict. Where Lenin saw the war as the
inevitable result of capitalist competition. MacDonald saw only &#8216;a
diplomatist&#8217;s war ... A dozen men brought Europe to the brink of a
precipice and Europe fell over it.&#8217; <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a>
As MacDonald told the Commons On 3 August 1914, in his last speech as
party leader, if the foreign secretary had proved &#8216;that our country
is in danger ... we would be with him and behind him. If this is so
we will vote him what money he wants. Yes, and we will go further. We
will offer him ourselves if the country is in danger. But he has not
persuaded me that it is.&#8217; <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>

<p>The pacifist and Christian socialist wing of the ILP took a more
militantly anti-war position, but their approach had no coherent
politics behind it. The No Conscription Fellowship &#8216;was based on
the principle of the &#8220;sacredness of human life&#8221; ... In its
branches, scattered throughout the country, were Socialists,
Anarchists and Quakers, and Other religious objectors.&#8217; <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Clydeside The legend and the reality</h4>

<p class="fst">The most fantastic mythology has grown up around the Clyde ILP,
suggesting some connection between the Labour MPs elected in 1922 and
wartime militancy associated with John Maclean and the Clyde Workers&#8217;
Committee. Is the claim justified?</p>

<p>The mouthpiece of the Glasgow ILP was <strong>Forward</strong>, which gained
notoriety when one issue was banned for alleged &#8216;incitement to
strike&#8217;. The editors were perplexed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Looking through the files of <strong>Forward</strong> we can find
no hint of any incitement ... The only big industrial strike on the
Clyde since war began was the Engineers&#8217; Strike in February 1915.
Neither before nor during the strike did we publish a single line
about it, nor did we even mention that it was taking place ... we
declared in our issue of 20th March that we should not touch the
subject of strikes during the war.&#8217; <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The police raid on <strong>Forward</strong> caused some embarrassment when
civil servants discovered that it &#8216;does not appear anywhere as an
anti-war paper.&#8217; <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p>What of the ILP&#8217;s leading individuals? Jimmy Maxton was
sentenced to 12 months for incitement. In his case, the charge was
more appropriate. On hearing of the arrest of leading stewards,
Maxton told a meeting: &#8216;It is now time to take action and that
action is to strike, to go home and forget to wind up your alarm
clocks, and down tools.&#8217; <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a> To
ensure that plain-clothes policemen took down every word, he repeated
this. A sympathetic commentator has explained Maxton&#8217;s motives:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Maxton had done nothing wilder in the war than voice his
militant pacifism, but as a conscientious objector he had already
been dismissed by the Glasgow School Board, and, being due shortly to
be interned, he felt it better to go down fighting ... than to be
meekly shut away. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Maxton, like Hardie, had a flair for spectacular gestures,
believing in their political efficacy, but even so, he deserves
credit as the most daring of all the Clydesiders.</p>

<p>Remarkably, the rest either adopted <strong>Forward</strong>&#8217;s approach,
or actively worked to prevent strikes. At first sight this is
surprising, since Davie Kirkwood of the ILP was a well-known Clyde
Workers&#8217; Committee activist. His position was ambiguous. Kirkwood&#8217;s
autobiography tells that at the outbreak of war:</p>

<p class="quoteb">a terrific struggle tore my breast. I could not hate the
Germans. They loved their land as I loved mine ... Yet I was working
in an arsenal making guns and shells for one purpose &#8211; to kill men
in order to keep them from killing men. What a confusion! What was I
to do. I was not a conscientious objector. I was a political
objector. I believed that financial and commercial rivalry had led to war.</p>

<p class="quote">I resolved that my skill as an engineer must be devoted
to my counter. I was too proud of the battles of the past to stand
aside and see Scotland conquered. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Clyde Workers&#8217; Committee was a rank and file revolt against
the dismantling of trade union defences by Henderson and the
officials. When in late 1915 the government wanted to &#8216;dilute&#8217;
skilled labour by introducing the unskilled to their work, the
committee decided to make this a political issue. They would only
accept dilution in return for nationalisation and workers&#8217; control.</p>

<p>Kirkwood ignored the committee and turned to John Wheatley, an ILP
councillor. These two sabotaged the strategy. On the day government
commissioners arrived to impose dilution, writes Kirkwood:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the War news was terrible ... We were all scared as the
thundering masses of Germans tramped their way towards the coasts ...
That night I went to John Wheatley ... In thirty minutes he drafted
the scheme ... which became the basis for the whole of Great Britain
and worked perfectly until the end of the War ... [But] the
extremists attacked us for having agreed to increased production.
John Mac made me the theme of innumerable speeches. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The scheme worked perfectly <em>for reformism</em>. It accepted
dilution as long as the overall wages bill was not reduced, thus
detaching the economic agitation from the political issue of war. <a href="#ng" name="fg">[7*]</a></p>

<p>Finally we come to Manny Shinwell who rose to being a Minister in
the Attlee administration. He angrily repudiated the suggestion that
he was anti-war: &#8216;Nothing could be further from the truth. I was
engaged on work of national importance on behalf of shipping.&#8217; <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>

<p>None of the Clydeside ILP believed in striking against the war or
even using the crisis to challenge the system at home, simply that
union organisation should not suffer unduly because of the fighting.
This was the limit of their radicalism. <a href="#nh" name="fh">[8*]</a></p>

<p>Lenin discerned three trends in the working class movement, and
all three were reproduced in Britain. There were the &#8216;social
chauvinists&#8217; (represented by the majority of the PLP and the trade
union bureaucracy); the &#8216;Centre&#8217; (the ILP); and the
revolutionaries (Maclean):</p>

<p class="quoteb">The social chauvinists i.e., socialists in words and
chauvinists in deed ... are our <em>class</em> enemies. They have gone
over to the bourgeoisie ...</p>

<p class="quote">The &#8216;Centre&#8217; is a realm of honeyed petty-bourgeois
phrases, of internationalism in word and cowardly opportunism and
fawning on the social chauvinists in deed.</p>

<p class="quote">The crux of the matter is that the &#8216;Centre&#8217; is not
convinced of the necessity for a revolution against one&#8217;s own
Government. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>

<p class="fst">MacDonald illustrated just how far &#8216;the Centre&#8217; was prepared
to go. Referring to himself and Henderson, he told a Labour
Conference that: &#8216;The differences between them were infinitesimal
when they came to realities and facts.&#8217; <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a>
A practical illustration of this was the issue of whether there
should be a negotiated settlement or &#8216;the knock-out blow&#8217; &#8211;
&#8216;the fight to the finish&#8217;. MacDonald said in the Commons:</p>

<p class="quoteb">A fight to the finish! If that is inevitable, it must be
done, there need by no quibble about that. I am not trying to evade
that issue. If the fight to a military finish is absolutely necessary
... then we cannot help it. It must be done. But I do not believe it
is. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Many were understandably confused. One delegate explained to the
1916 Labour Conference: &#8216;In Scotland they had a national dance
where they laid down two swords and danced all round them. Mr
MacDonald had done that to absolute perfection ... He was at a loss
to know where Mr MacDonald was. He had been at a loss to know, from
the very beginning of the war, where the ILP stood.&#8217; <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p>Overtures were also made from the other side. The trade unions
re-elected MacDonald as Labour Party treasurer throughout the war.
Disagreements could not stand in the way of sinecures. As Jimmy
Thomas put it: &#8216;after all, the war is but the question of the
moment.&#8217; <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a> Thomas was an astute
reformist. Take his refusal to enter the wartime coalition cabinet.
As he wrote, this was</p>

<p class="quoteb">a mystery to many of my friends. My views were best
summarised in the answer I gave to King George V ... I told him that
when the war was over I was certain that the only people who would
have any real influence with the masses during the inevitable chaos
and difficulties that must arise after the armistice, would be those
in a position to say &#8216;I at least made nothing out of the war&#8217;.
<a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The political skills of Thomas and Co. were soon in great demand;
the long patriotic bacchanalia was coming to an end.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The triumph of statism</h4>

<p class="fst">Reformists believe that the state is above the &#8216;haggling&#8217; of
classes; it is a means of resolving class division. This attitude is
not accidental but reflects the views of the labour bureaucracy and
its search for class compromise. The bureaucrat&#8217;s role is to
negotiate and this naturally leads to a view of the state as the
institution through which such class collaboration can be organised
on the broadest scale.</p>

<p>Given this attitude it was inevitable that Labour politics should
be profoundly influenced by the &#8216;national crisis&#8217; of war and the
development of the wartime state. We have already seen that from the
1800s the Fabians made the state practically their religion. During
the war this reached paroxysms of enthusiasm. The result was
terrifying. Sidney Webb wrote: &#8216;If I were in power ... I should
decree <em>Universal Submission</em> to the national need &#8211; not young
men for the trenches only, but everyone for what he was fitted; and
not persons only, but also property and possessions &#8211; everything to
be placed at the disposal of the Government.&#8217; <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p>Only the trade union bureaucracy, with their experience of legal
and police attacks on strikers and union rights, had any reservations
and these were swept away. For the war brought a revolution in the
officials&#8217; status. The Treasury Agreement was an example. Led by
Arthur Henderson, the union leaders agreed to suspend all rules and
customs impeding maximum output. Job demarcation, strikes, refusal of
overtime, restrictions on night and Sunday working and a good deal of
health and safety legislation went the same way. In return for this
paltry sacrifice (after all it was their members not themselves who
had to work the new conditions) they received a magnificent prize:
&#8216;the capitalist employers were ignored, and the principal Ministers
of the Crown negotiated directly with the authorized representatives
of the whole trade Union world.&#8217; <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a>
Positions in the government and on official bodies now began to
absorb great numbers of officials, making the trade unions and Labour
Party virtually organs of state. In his presidential address to the
1917 TUC John Hill of the Boilermakers put it thus: &#8216;the prejudice
of trade unionists against politicians has hitherto held us back ...
but the events of the last three years have taken the scales from our
eyes.&#8217; &#8216;The man,&#8217; he said, &#8216;in our ranks today who is neither
a Government official nor a member of some Government Committee is
unknown to the movement.&#8217; <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a></p>

<p>Principles whose renunciation had previously been inconceivable
were freely dispensed with. Conscription was universally abhorred as
an infringement of a sacred British freedom. On 6 January 1915 a
conference of the chief labour movement bodies not only voted by a
majority of 2 to 1 against conscription, but called on Labour to
leave the wartime coalition. Henderson was not one to be put off by
such things. He told delegates to their faces: &#8216;If this conference
considers I must oppose this Bill [for conscription] I shall refuse
to accept their decision.&#8217; <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a> So
just two weeks after the conference rejecting conscription a further
Labour Conference was induced to swallow it.</p>

<p>The fascination that the state exercised over the bureaucracy was
not necessarily the result of cynical personal ambition. It reflected
a powerful sentiment that has cropped up every time Labour enters
government &#8211; that the aim of representatives is to penetrate the
&#8216;corridors of power&#8217; and stay there, whatever the cost in
principle. As Beatrice Webb explained when Labour joined Lloyd
George&#8217;s administration:</p>

<p class="quoteb">A thorough beating of the Germans may have passed through
their minds. But their main motive ... is the illusion that the mere
presence of labour men in the Government, apart from anything they
may do or prevent being done, is in itself a sign of democratic
process. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The corridors of power were made much broader and far-reaching by
the war. In 1914 the civil service numbered 57,706 people; after the
war 116,241. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a> By 1918 90 per cent
of the country&#8217;s imports were purchased directly by the state,
while 240 National Factories were established and millions more
workers were on government contracts. Two-thirds of all workers and a
vast range of social and economic activity, from the food on your
table to hours and conditions of work, were now under state
regulation. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a> This was clearly a
form of centralised state capitalism &#8211; the most brutal expression
of ruling class war &#8211; since everything was subordinated to defend
British capital against enemies abroad and at home. <em>The complete
absorption of the upper reaches of the labour movement into the
bourgeois state</em> was clearly a lurch to the right.</p>

<p>However, once more we must remember the fundamental difference
between reaction and reform. To the capitalist the state was a
valuable adjunct to the process of capital accumulation. In war the
most enthusiastic supporters of this concept were the &#8216;social
imperialists&#8217; around Lord Milner. They even tried to make inroads
into the labour movement with a British Workers&#8217; league but this
failed dismally. As Marwick points out there is a basic &#8216;distinction
between the militarist who desires happy and healthy cannon fodder,
and the collectivist who desires a better and humane society.&#8217;
<a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Reconstructing the party</h4>

<p class="fst">At the beginning of 1917 the Labour Party was still deep in the
mire of class collaboration. Yet by the end of the year Labour had
broken free and was poised to bid for power on a socialist programme.</p>

<p>Leopards do not usually change their spots, so what happened 1917
to bring about the change? It was the revival of working class
confidence symbolised by two Russian Revolutions and class struggle
at home. Although five million workers were away in the army,
Britain&#8217;s trade union membership rose from four to six and a half a
million between 1914 and 1918. The immediate shock of war had reduced
strike days per year to almost nil, but by the end of the war the
annual figure was six million working days lost through strikes,
double what it had been when the Labour Party was founded. This was
at a time when strikers risked taking on the bosses, the police,
army, trade union officials and Labour Party; The militants who led
activity, as in all previous struggles, rejected Labour&#8217;s passive
electoral approach. Many indeed were revolutionaries.</p>

<p>Mining and engineering stood out. In July 1915 two hundred
thousand South Wales colliers stopped work over pay. In five days
they won. South Wales was influenced by syndicalists who published
the famous <strong>Miners&#8217; Next Step</strong>. The engineering shop stewards&#8217;
movement was even more important. It began on Clydeside but soon
fanned out into a national network which in May 1917 led a three-week
strike of 200,000 &#8211; the largest of the war. The central figures in
the national stewards&#8217; movement were revolutionaries such as Willie
Gallacher, Arthur McManus and J.T. Murphy, who joined the Communist
Party when it was later established. Behind the revolutionary leaders
and the militant industries a growing volume of discontent was piling up.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s reaction to rising struggle was a combination of
resistance and adaptation. It did its level best to prevent stoppages
but also sought to channel workers&#8217; anger. Preventing stoppages had
priority even for those supposedly on the left. Thus MacDonald
reassured the House of Commons: &#8216;believe me when I say that, rather
than [be] an agent to bring men out on strike just now, I would ...
destroy every particle of influence that ever I had with the working
men. <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a> <strong>Labour Leader</strong> wrote:
&#8216;Whatever may be one&#8217;s view about the war ... one cannot but
regret there should be strikes.&#8217; <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a>
Labour&#8217;s adaptation to rising struggle, and its own organisational
renewal, first showed in the work of the War Emergency Workers&#8217;
National Committee.</p>

<p>While the Labour Party was riven by internal strife this little
committee brought together the diverse elements from Webb to Hyndman,
from MacDonald to the trade union leaders. Indeed, &#8216;aside from its
sponsorship of [the War Emergency Workers National Committee] the
Labour Party hardly existed as a national organisation until late in
the war.&#8217; <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a> The committee was a
sort of reformist think-tank, launching initiatives which, by
ignoring the war and concentrating on conditions at home, established
landmarks for the post-war programme.</p>

<p>One suggestion was the &#8216;conscription of riches&#8217;. Since workers
could be conscripted to fight for their country, why not take over
personal wealth too? When first proposed at the War Emergency Workers
National Committee 1916 the suggestion was lost. It was only adopted
there in October 1917 and by the Labour Party Executive in November
1917. Surely the fact that it was agreed in the very shadow of the
Russian revolution was no coincidence.</p>

<p>Another sign of a political thaw was the Leeds Convention. Held on
3 June 1917 it brought together 1,150 delegates representing all
organisations critical of the war. MacDonald described the game
played at Leeds in an article written shortly afterwards: &#8216;Before
the war I felt that what was called &#8220;the spirit of the rebel&#8221; was
to a great extent a stagey pose. It is now required to save us.&#8217; <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a></p>

<p>MacDonald&#8217;s first gambit was to pay tribute to Russia&#8217;s
February revolution. Addressing the Convention he said: &#8216;When this
war broke out organised Labour in this country lost the initiative.
It became a mere echo of the old governing classes&#8217; opinions. Now
the Russian Revolution has once again given you the chance to take
the initiative yourselves.&#8217; <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>

<p>But the most elaborate &#8216;stagey pose&#8217; was struck by W.C.
Anderson, the ILP MP who called for no less than the establishment of
&#8216;Councils of Workmen and Soldiers&#8217; Delegates for ... the complete
political and economic emancipation of international labour.&#8217; <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a>
This was stirring stuff! Alas, those present had not heard Anderson
expressing his true feelings just before this in the Commons: &#8216;the
best way if you wish to deal with extremists is to remove discontent
and try to get a better relationship established between the
Government and organized labour ... unless you are very careful you
will bring the country to the very verge of revolution.&#8217; <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&#8216;Uncle Arthur&#8217; &#8211; apostle of Labour&#8217;s socialist conversion</h4>

<p class="fst">The War Emergency Workers National Committee and Leeds Convention
heralded great things to come, but produced no lasting results
themselves. Labour was eventually led to the promised land of
socialism by the most unlikely of prophets &#8211; Arthur Henderson. He
is a familiar figure in these pp.&nbsp;as a Liberal election agent
denouncing socialism, as the trade union voice in the Labour
Alliance, as sponsor to Will Crooks&#8217;s anti-union Bill and finally
as the first Labour Minister valiantly putting &#8216;country before
party&#8217; (or rather capitalist state before class).</p>
<p>Yet in 1917 Henderson not only resigned from the coalition <a href="#ni" name="fi">[9*]</a>,
but went on, with Webb&#8217;s assistance, to reorganise the Labour
Party, giving it a socialist programme. Henderson&#8217;s &#8216;conversion&#8217;
was fascinating, not for biographical reasons, but because it sharply
summarised changes in the bureaucracy as a whole. The saga began on
30 May 1917 when Lloyd George sent him on a mission to Russia, his
task to bolster Russia&#8217;s flagging military enthusiasm in the wake
of the Tsar&#8217;s downfall.</p>

<p>According to <strong>The Times</strong> Henderson made quite a splash in Petrograd:</p>

<p class="quoteb">His reference to the unanimous determination of all
classes in the British empire to continue the struggle till a
victorious peace had been assured evoked tremendous cheering ... Men
and women, moved to tears, demanded a general mobilization, amid
cries of: &#8216;We all are ready to march against the foe.&#8217; <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The truth was a bit different, for by then the Bolsheviks were
rapidly growing in influence. Russian workers must have been
bewildered by this man who claimed to speak for labour but was so
obviously a tool of the bosses. Indeed, Henderson&#8217;s apartment was
ransacked by &#8216;Leninists [who] stole his papers to ascertain whether
he was really a Socialist leader or merely an agent of the British
Government.&#8217; <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a></p>

<p>Russia both excited and frightened Henderson. He saw reformist
socialists lifted into government, but he also saw workers who, he
said, wished &#8216;to place Directors and Managers in a subordinate
position and the supreme control in the hands of the workpeople
themselves ... it can only have results that will be disaster.&#8217;
<a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a> Returning to Britain in the late
summer Henderson was quick to apply the lessons of Russia. A horror
of revolution and belief in the need for pre-emptive reformist
measures shines out of every p.&nbsp;of his January 1918 booklet <strong>The
Aims of Labour</strong>. The Chapter on <em>Revolution or Compromise?</em>
begins: &#8216;Revolution is a word of evil omen. It calls up a vision of
barricades in the streets and blood in the gutters [and] is alien to
the British character.&#8217; <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a> His
public confidence in the non-revolutionary nature of British workers
was contradicted by a later statement:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Never before have we had such vast numbers of the
population skilled in the use of arms, disciplined, inured to danger
... When the war ends this country and every other will be flooded
with hardy veterans ... if barricades are indeed likely to be erected
in our streets they will be manned by men who have learned how to
fight ... [It] will be veritable civil war. <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a></p>

<p class="fst">What conclusion did he draw? &#8216;One good reason for beginning now
to build up a strong democratic party in Parliament, with a programme
of social and economic reforms carefully thought out [is] to prove
that political methods are effective ... <em>The Labour Party can
rehabilitate Parliament in the eyes of the people.</em>&#8217; <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a></p>

<p class="fst">To assist him in this rehabilitation Henderson dared not turn to
the unpopular ILP. Instead he relied on the <em>guru</em> of the
religion of state socialism &#8211; Sidney Webb. Webb fully shared
Henderson&#8217;s fears and willingly embraced his reformist project. In
November 1918 Webb published a letter proclaiming: &#8216;The best
safeguard against &#8220;Bolshevism&#8221; is a strong Labour Party in
Parliament, voicing the discontent ... If you <em>want</em> a Bolshevik
revolution in this country, the surest way to get it is to succeed in
eliminating or discrediting the Labour Party!&#8217; <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a>
How true!<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The 1918 constitution: A quest for the &#8216;people&#8217;s party&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">The reorganisation of the Labour Party proposed by Webb and
Henderson involved advance on both fronts of class and nation. Union
growth and the marginalisation of the ILP endowed the full-time
officials with an even greater weight in the party than before. But
it was the logic of reformist beliefs that they should deny its class
roots and strive to make the party speak for &#8216;the national
interest&#8217;. Yet there was a difficulty. With 98 per cent of the
party made up of affiliated trade unionists it was not easy to
portray this as a &#8216;classless&#8217; organisation. The problem was given
added urgency by the 1918 Representation of the People Act which
brought many non-unionised women into the electorate.</p>

<p>The party&#8217;s 1918 Constitution solved this by creating local
Labour Parties and a system of individual membership. One victim of
the change was the ILP which had in effect been Labour&#8217;s chief
constituency organisation. The union bureaucrats had not forgiven the
ILP&#8217;s pacifism. Trades Councils, which also acted as Labour&#8217;s
local organisation and provided a focus for militants, were cut out too.</p>

<p>At first the idea of calling the reorganised body the &#8216;People&#8217;s
Party&#8217; was seriously canvassed. <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a>
The 1918 Labour Conference made it clear who these &#8216;people&#8217; were
&#8211; middle class non socialists &#8211; those without &#8216;the opportunity
of joining trade unions on the one hand, or on the other, who are not
prepared to associate with the socialist organisations.&#8217; <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a>
This fitted with another motive. The Labour Party had set its sights
on government and the social planners who refashioned the party were
convinced that &#8216;Labour was not yet intellectually and
administratively equal to the responsibility.&#8217; <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a>
Henderson put it less elegantly: &#8216;The Labour Party had been too
short of brains.&#8217; <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a> Individual
membership should remedy this.</p>

<p>The Party chairman explained the political consequences. &#8216;We aim
in the years to come to be the People&#8217;s Party &#8211; a Party not
parochial in its conceptions, but national in its character.&#8217; <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a>
For &#8216;not parochial&#8217; read untainted by a trade union orientation.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Socialism at last</h4>

<p class="fst">Clause Four of the 1918 Constitution &#8211; &#8216;To secure for the
producers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry, and
the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible, upon
the basis of the common ownership of the means of production&#8217; &#8211;
is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Labour&#8217;s history. In a
body where symbolism frequently outweighs reality, this is the holy
of holies. It is the most pious of Labour&#8217;s many pious resolutions,
yet its words are important. They mark the <em>conversion of the
Labour Party into a &#8216;socialist&#8217; organisation, or, to be more
exact, a mass reformist party</em> distinct from the two openly
capitalist parties.</p>

<p>So how is Clause Four to be understood? Firstly, it was drafted by
Webb and championed by Henderson as a <em>conscious means of staving
off revolution</em>. It was the fear of mass action which forced them
to take this step. Thus the 1922 manifesto finished with the headline
&#8216;AGAINST REVOLUTION&#8217; and claimed: &#8216;Labour&#8217;s programme is the
best bulwark against violent upheaval and class wars.&#8217; <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a>
There is an important difference between Clause Four in 1918 and
Clause Four today. Seventy years ago it registered the high water
mark of workers&#8217; pressure on the Labour Party. Since then the
imminence of revolution has never been so great. But Clause Four
remains in the party constitution &#8211; a relic of days gone by. In
this sense it must now he defended as a sign of Labour&#8217;s commitment
to a minimal anti-capitalist position which some leaders would like
to forget.</p>

<p>While its symbolic value is its most important feature, other
points should be noticed. The clause talks about &#8216;producers by hand
or brain&#8217;, the latter being a clear reference the social planners,
intellectuals and the middle-class baggage of Fabianism so beloved of
Webb. &#8216;Common ownership&#8217; is clearly intended to come through
constitutional means. This is no revolutionary document. But Its
final call for &#8216;the best obtainable system of popular
administration control of each industry and service&#8217; is a
concession to the mass demand for workers&#8217; control.</p>

<p>Previous attempts to write socialism into the constitution had met
a strange fate. The foundation conference rejected the SDF&#8217;s &#8216;class
war&#8217; motion. Yet the 1900 LRC manifesto demanded &#8216;the
Socialisation of the Means of Production, Distribution and Exchange&#8217;.
<a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a> The following year a socialist
resolution from Bruce Glasier was defeated. In 1903 another was lost
without a debate. Two years later <em>the very same wording was
passed</em>, again without a debate! In 1907 things became even more
bizarre. The previous endorsement of socialism was overturned, at the
request of Bruce Glasier and Keir Hardie, by a massive 835,000 to
98,000. In 1908 socialism lost even more heavily. <em>But</em>, strange
to recount, the same conference voted to set &#8216;as a definite object
the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and
exchange&#8217;, and the 1914 conference &#8216;again reaffirmed&#8217; this.
<a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a></p>

<p>There was method in this madness. Conference supported pious
declarations of socialism but refused to put them in the
constitution. In other words, although the majority of delegates
regarded themselves as socialists they thought it would lose votes if
socialism was too prominent. The aim of the Labour Party was not to
fight for advanced ideas in the working class, but to collect the
most votes. As the ILP&#8217;s <strong>Labour Leader</strong> said in 1908:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;We want Socialism&#8217; cry the impatients. So did every
member of the ILP. [But] we have to make the electors of this county
want it, and to persuade the average unimaginative, overworked, and
underpaid working-man, the small shopkeeper, and the struggling
ratepayer, with all their various religious, political and social
prejudices to vote for it. There&#8217;s the rub! <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The radicalisation brought by war made it possible for Labour to
accept Clause Four without it being an electoral liability. Labour
has a definite view of <em>the relationship between ends and means</em>.
To a Marxist they cannot be separate. The goal of socialism dictates
the means &#8211; the mass overthrow of capitalism led by a revolutionary
party. But as the Labour Party debates on socialism demonstrated, for
reformists <em>the means are more important than the goal. Success in
elections came first</em>.</p>

<p>Labour leaders treated Clause Four more as a useful slogan than a
definite plan of action. The distinction has revealed in an
interesting exchange at the 1918 Conference. A British Socialist
Party delegate pointed out that the resolutions on the order paper
were &#8216;not in conformity with the Party objects as set out in the
Constitution. The latter was explicitly in favour of the social
ownership of the means of production.&#8217; <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a>
But Webb, the author, thought that one mention somewhere in the
Constitution was sufficient: &#8216;they did not want repeatedly, over
and over again, to ring the changes on the old shibboleths.
[Shibboleths are &#8216;party catch-words&#8217;.] The resolutions were not
an appeal to the converted but the basis of an appeal to the twenty
million electors&#8217;. <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a></p>

<p>The ILP was unsure about co-operating with the new Constitution
<a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a> but eventually decided there was
no alternative. <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a> But the new regime
had its compensations, for the ILP <em>leadership</em> at least.
&#8216;Brains&#8217; were now a valued commodity, and through the UDC, the No
Conscription Fellowship and the like, the ILP had acquired a lot of
grey matter. As a visiting German Social Democrat, Wertheimer, put it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The party which before the war had been a definite
proletarian organisation in spite of intellectual leadership, became
overrun by ex-Liberals, young-men-just-down-from-Oxford guiltless of
any socialist tradition, ideologists and typical monomaniacs full of
their own projects. <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Indeed the notion of the ILP as the left and the union bureaucracy
as the right, or <em>vice versa</em> ceased to make sense &#8211; they
became different parts of a technical division of labour. The
difficulties of the ILP did illustrate one important fact however.
The commitment to socialism was not achieved by the burrowing away of
the &#8216;Labour left&#8217;. In 1918 the ILP was still despised for its
pacifism and treated with contempt. The mass shift to the left came
from struggles outside reformist electoral politics and in spite of
such politics.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Labour&#8217;s new social order</h4>

<p class="fst">The idea of Labour as a &#8216;People&#8217;s Party&#8217; and Clause Four
were the right and left faces of the 1918 reconstruction, but the
programme <strong>Labour and the New Social Order</strong> was its centrepiece,
the place where class and nation met.</p>

<p>This document was written by Sidney Webb and was passed in avenged
form by the 1918 Labour Conference. Its key points can be divided
into those that dealt with <em>social reforms</em> and those that
concerned <em>restructuring of the economy</em>. We shall discuss each
in turn.</p>

<p>The Labour Party has always raised the cause of the victims of
capitalist society. One early example was an article Keir Hardie
wrote in 1894 after a mining disaster. It caused a sensation:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Welsh holocaust puts everything into the shade this
week. Two hundred and fifty human beings full of strong life in the
morning, reduced to charred and blackened heaps of clay in the
evening. The air rent with the wail of the childless mother, the
widowed wife and the orphaned child. Woe, woe unutterable everywhere,
all through that fair Welsh valley ... Only those who know, as I
know, that these things are preventable and solely due to man&#8217;s
cupidity, can understand the bitterness of feeling which they awaken
... society places more value on property than it does on human life. <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Though the Liberal Party discussed social reform, Labour made
protest against poverty its hallmark. <strong>Labour and the New Social
Order</strong> called for the &#8216;Maintenance and Protection of the
Standard of Life&#8217; through a legal minimum wage, for employment or
decent welfare provision for discharged soldiers and improvements in
education, housing and poor relief.</p>

<p>In 1918 the situation appeared favourable for such a programme.
The war economy had temporarily eliminated unemployment. <strong>Labour
and the New Social Order</strong> concluded that this could easily be
rendered permanent &#8216;by nothing more difficult or more revolutionary
than a sensible distribution of public orders for workers and
services&#8217;. <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a></p>

<p>Even the most radical members of the party always pose human
suffering as an <em>unnecessary</em> side effect of capitalist society
which can be remedied without uprooting the system as a whole. The
solution to the problem of poverty is always put <em>within the
framework of the nation state</em> and is justified <em>by its
beneficial effect on the nation as a whole</em>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Labour&#8217;s protest against poverty and unemployment
expresses the heartfelt aspirations of millions of workers and is not
an electoral gimmick. It is foolish to picture the party as a cunning
plot to dupe workers by condemning suffering simply to gain a
parliamentary salary. Workers are not stupid, and if such had been
the case the party would have been seen through long ago. As we know,
it still retains the loyalty of the vast majority of the conscious
working class.</p>

<p>This loyalty is not dictated by the union bureaucracy either. The
bureaucracy cannot determine how citizens vote. <em>As long as workers
wish to create a better world, but lack the confidence to do it
themselves, Labour will retain a decisive influence.</em> Reformism
may cease to make sense of reality, just as religion did when Galileo
showed that the earth moved or Darwin wrote <strong>The Origin of Species</strong>.
But as Marx said of religion, so we can say of reformism: it
expresses &#8216;the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a
heartless world.&#8217; <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a> <em>On a mass
scale reformism will never be undermined by appealing for workers to
cast out their illusions, it can only be done by helping to raise the
confidence of the working class through their own experience of
struggle.</em> As Marx put it in relation to religion:</p>

<p class="quoteb">To call on them to give up their illusions about their
condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires
illusions. <a href="#n83" name="f83">[83]</a></p>

<p class="fst">However, to say that Labour genuinely channels workers&#8217; hopes
for a better life does not mean that it is capable of delivering its
promises. Seven Labour governments are ample proof of that. Labour&#8217;s
potential is fatally limited by a reformist outlook that prevents it
from harnessing the only force capable of changing conditions
radically &#8211; the collective power of the working class.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Social reconstruction and nationalisation</h4>

<p class="fst">The most important aspect of <strong>Labour and the New Social Order</strong>
was its treatment of the capitalist economy, the health of which was
seen as the foundation for reforms. Labour had its own distinctive
method of maintaining the economy &#8211; nationalisation. Historically
this has been the most important plank of Labour Party policy, and
for good reason &#8211; <em>it appears simultaneously to meet the needs of
natural interest, working-class aspiration and of the trade union and
political bureaucracy!</em> Thus in 1911 Snowden proposed mines
nationalisation because: &#8216;It will be a good thing for the miners;
it will benefit the general trade of the country; and the nation as a
whole will gain much advantage ... being free from the turmoil and
inconvenience so often caused now by labour troubles.&#8217; <a href="#n84" name="f84">[84]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Nationalisation and the &#8216;national interest&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">Labour&#8217;s &#8216;new social order&#8217; was to be based on the extension
of the wartime state capitalist economy. Jimmy Thomas underlined the point:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The taking over of railways, mines, munitions factories,
and other controlled establishments during the war, really meant that
in the considered judgement of the government ... a capitalist
Government &#8211; the private ownership of these things in time of war
was a danger to the State. Why? Because they believed that
unrestricted competition ... was a menace to the State. <a href="#n85" name="f85">[85]</a></p>

<p class="fst">State capitalism (though never given that name) was held to be a
more efficient system than private ownership. As MacDonald told the
conference in the debate on &#8216;Increased Production&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">They could not afford to have any antagonism, or friction
in production. They could not afford to have managers who could not
manage ... They must introduce a conception of coloration, and regard
society from top to bottom &#8211; the brain workers, the manual worker,
the organiser, the direct producer &#8211; regard them all as
Co-operative factors in one great common life. <a href="#n86" name="f86">[86]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In other words, the Labour Party consciously set at the head of
its reformist programme <em>the management of capitalism</em>. No other
solution was possible for a party wishing to run a capitalist state.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Nationalisation and the struggle for workers&#8217; control</h4>

<p class="fst">However we would seriously underestimate the importance of
nationalisation if it were regarded as simply a blueprint for
capitalist development. In 1918 millions saw it as a means towards
controlling their lives and, like the campaign for a statutory
eight-hour day in 1889, a way of forcing concessions through
collective pressure on the state.</p>

<p>There was nothing specifically socialist about nationalisation
itself. The most die-hard Lib-Lab Union had been the Miners&#8217;
Federation, yet it was the first to adopt nationalisation, long
before it joined the Labour Party. The miners and railwaymen were in
the forefront of the movement because, unlike the craft unions which
enjoyed sectional strength, they depended on centralised bargaining
to establish effective negotiating rights. The 1907 rail strike and
the 1912 coal strike succeeded by forcing the government to intervene
to impose negotiated settlements on obdurate employers. Furthermore
both industries were exceptionally dangerous to work in and under
national control might be exacted to have fewer accidents.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Nationalisation and the union bureaucracy</h4>

<p class="fst">Nationalisation fitted the trade union bureaucracy like a glove
because it was a method of mediation. As the <strong>Labour Leader</strong>
wrote just after the 1919 national rail strike: &#8216;To put an end to
strikes we must reconcile the interests of Capital and Labour by
making the community of workers the owners and directors.&#8217; <a href="#n87" name="f87">[87]</a>
Emil Davies of the Nationalisation Society declared that &#8216;Some
sections of the world of labour may at times demand more than
conditions justify. This very circumstance is a strong argument in
favour of the participation of the workers in the management.&#8217; <a href="#n88" name="f88">[88]</a> <a href="#nj" name="fj">[10*]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Nationalisation and reformist politics</h4>

<p class="fst">The principle of nationalisation also suited the reformist aim of
the piecemeal take-over of industries rather than their revolutionary
expropriation. Change was constitutional, in parliament, and from the
top. The rank and file were to do nothing themselves.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s nationalisation proposals fully accorded with Marx&#8217;s
comments on nineteenth century petty bourgeois democrats who seek:</p>

<p class="quoteb">a means of softening the antagonism between the two
extremes of capital and wage labour and transforming it into harmony,
not of superseding both of them. However varied the measures for
achieving this goal, however much it may be edged with more or less
revolutionary conceptions, its content remains the same. This content
is the reformation of society by democratic means, but a reformation
within the boundaries set by the petty bourgeoisie. <a href="#n89" name="f89">[89]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Labour Party that emerged at the end of the First World War
was very different to its pre-war form. While we have concentrated on
the party itself, it must be remembered that <em>it was pressure from
the working class that pushed the labour bureaucracy into a new
approach</em>.</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#fa" name="na">1*.</a> The strength of this feeling in
the Liberal Party should not be forgotten. John Morley led the
anti-war faction in the cabinet. Until put to the test with the
actual outbreak of hostilities he believed he had a Cabinet majority
of eight or nine, although at the time of his resignation only John
Burns joined him. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fb" name="nb">2*.</a> When Labour applied for admission
to the Second International in 1908 it caused much debate. In the end
the party was accepted as an exceptional case. The problem was that
there was nothing specifically socialist in the Party programme.
Indeed it <em>had no agreed programme</em>! The wording of the
resolution was prepared by Kautsky and ran as follows: &#8216;Whereas by
previous resolutions of the International Congresses, all
organisations adopting the standpoint of the proletarian class
struggle and revising the necessity for political action have been
accepted for membership, the International Bureau declares that the
British Labour Party is admitted to International Socialist
Congresses, because, while not expressly accepting the proletarian
class struggle, in practice the Labour Party conducts this struggle
and adopts its standpoint, inasmuch as the Party is organised
independently of the bourgeois parties.&#8217; <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p class="note">In 1912 the International choked upon the Labour Party&#8217;s
pursuance of the class struggle &#8216;in practice&#8217; and asked Arthur
Henderson to provide it with &#8216;all Socialist Bills [proposed] in the
House of Commons.&#8217; Henderson did not, nor indeed could not reply. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fc" name="nc">3*.</a> Two qualifications must be made.
Firstly Hardie clearly thought that the <em>threat</em> of a general
strike would be quite sufficient and never envisioned, or actually
prepared for, a real strike: &#8216;I hold the opinion that the organised
Labour movement has it in its power to prevent war by simply
threatening to strike ... Even the threat ... would necessitate the
keeping of the army at home ... Suppose then, an agreement on the
part of the workers in all civilised countries to make war upon war
by means of the strike, the knowledge that such would take place
would make war impossible.&#8217; <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fd" name="nd">4*.</a> A further complication arises
because the trade union bureaucracy are themselves a superstructure
built upon the collective organisation of the working class in the
factories and offices. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fe" name="ne">5*.</a> The British Socialist Party
actually split in two when Hyndman broke away with his pro-war minority.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#ff" name="nf">6*.</a> In the ILP heartland of Bradford
in 1918 the ILP had 429 members in the armed services, nineteen in
jail and twenty-nine conscientious objectors who had opted for
alternative service. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fg" name="ng">7*.</a> Despite his efforts at moderation,
Kirkwood was deported with Gallacher, MacManus and others when the
government moved in to smash the Clyde Workers Committee. He was too
prominent a figurehead to leave alone, and in any case, the
government was in the business of breaking reformist trade union
resistance to the war economy not just the revolutionaries. Later on,
however, to show was bad feeling, MacDonald convinced Winston
Churchill, a government minister, that Kirkwood should be &#8216;put in
charge&#8217; of a munitions factory. He duly obliged.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fh" name="nh">8*.</a> Their chief contribution to
Glasgow&#8217;s labour movement lay not in the industrial field but in
the fight against rent increases. Wheatley and the ILP were prominent
in the rent strike that eventually forced the government to control
increases. As we shall see in the of Poplar, local government can
occasionally provide an area for agitation which escapes the
crippling logic of the reformism that outlaws industrial action for
fear of damaging parliament.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fi" name="ni">9*.</a> He resigned over the government&#8217;s
refusal to allow participation in the Stockholm conference called by
various socialist parties. Labour still continued as a member of the
coalition, however.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fj" name="nj">10*.</a> The movement for workers&#8217;
control found expression in different ways, the most influential
being G.D.H. Cole&#8217;s Guild Socialism. This attempted to produce a
sanitised reformist syndicalism and blunt the edge of workers&#8217;
activity. It institutionalised the struggle for workers&#8217; control
putting the official machinery at the centre. This ensured that
agitation could not spill over into politics.</p>

<p class="note">Guilds were unions organised to run industry for themselves.
Rather than nationalise from the centre they would gradually supplant
foremen and then managers by a creeping process of &#8216;encroaching
control&#8217;, taking over management functions one by one.</p>

<p class="note">This was petty bourgeois fantasy <em>par excellence</em>. Guild
Socialism could not endure, its one practical experiment being a
builders&#8217; guild which lasted for a brief and unhappy moment.
However, because of its stress on powerful (but official) union
organisation, it exercised a fascination for left-wing bureaucrats
and even the ILP, which incorporated Guild Socialist ideas in its
1922 constitution, at the very moment the movement had dropped stone
dead. The same illusion in gradually reforming capitalism at factory
level reappeared fifty years later in the ill-fated workers&#8217;
cooperatives of the Bennite era.</p>
