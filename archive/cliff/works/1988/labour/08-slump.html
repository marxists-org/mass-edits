<h3>The Labour Party</h3>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h1>8. Reformists and the Slump: The Second Labour Government</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">IF THE GENERAL STRIKE is the recurring nightmare of the trade
union bureaucracy, the 1929&#8211;31 Labour Government holds terrors for
the Party leadership. For the first time a reformist administration
had to cope with full-scale capitalist crisis. The result was a
disaster which Sidney Webb said &#8216;finds no parallel in anything in
the Parliamentary annals of this or any other county.&#8217; <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>
Clement Attlee, saw it as &#8216;the greatest political betrayal in the
political history of this country.&#8217; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p>The main outlines of the story can be briefly told. Elected in the
year of the Wall Street crash, the government limped on aimlessly
until the summer of 1931 when it was hit by the full force of what
prime minister MacDonald called &#8216;the economic blizzard&#8217;. In
August he proposed a 10 per cent cut in unemployment benefit. A
majority of the cabinet agreed, but MacDonald, Snowden and Thomas
broke with Labour anyway to form a National Government with Tories
and Liberals: At the 1931 Election which followed. Labour plummeted
from 289 to 46 MPs. With the sole exception of Lansbury, all those
cabinet ministers who remained faithful to Labour lost&#8217; their seats.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The road to 1931</h4>

<p class="fst">After the General Strike the new-found dominance of the Labour
right wing was not confined to witch-hunting Communists. Labour
acquired a new programme, scrapping <strong>Labour and the New Social
Order</strong>, which it had held since 1918, to make way in 1927 for
<strong>Labour and the Nation</strong>. The change of name was significant.
Although the earlier document was by no means revolutionary, the
later version was so vague that, in Maxton&#8217;s words, it meant
&#8216;giving a free hand to the next Labour Government to define any
programme it pleases.&#8217; <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> No doubt
MacDonald saw as a virtue the very point criticised by Wheatley:
&#8216;No-one suggests we are doing anything more than undertaking to run
capitalism successfully where other people equally qualified have
failed to run capitalism in the past.&#8217; <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> <a href="#na" name="fa">[1*]</a></p>

<p>When Labour won in May 1929 MacDonald prophesied: &#8216;I have reason
to believe that this Government will go down into history as the
Government of Employment.&#8217; (!) <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a>
Labour was the biggest party in the Commons with 289 MPs, though it
still lacked an absolute majority, the Tories having 260 and the
Liberals 58.</p>

<p>The government made its intentions plain with a king&#8217;s speech
which &#8216;chilled the Parliamentary Labour Party&#8217; <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>.
One perceptive Tory remarked:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It may be one of fate&#8217;s little ironies that the
principal tasks confronting the present so-called Socialist
administration should be to make Great Britain safe for the
capitalist. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p> 

<p class="fst">Before considering the central issue of unemployment, we will
quickly deal with some other items of policy. Labour began by
refusing Trotsky Political asylum because he &#8216;would inevitably be
the centre of mischief-making and intrigue.&#8217; <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>
This was too much for even some Liberals and Tories, who valued the
British tradition of sheltering political refugees.</p>

<p>In revenge for the General Strike Baldwin had passed the hated
1927 Trades Disputes Act to make certain strikes illegal and attack
the political levy. <strong>Labour and the Nation</strong> vowed: &#8216;Among the
<em>first</em> tasks of the Labour Party will be the repeal of the
cynical measures of class legislation by which the Conservatives have
sought to cripple the strength of trade unionism&#8217;. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>
<a href="#nb" name="fb">[2*]</a> Yet months passed without action and
Ernest Bevin accused the government of backdoor manoeuvres designed
to avoid repeal. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> Grudgingly a weak
Bill was introduced in 1931, but according to Mowat the Cabinet
secretly arranged for a Liberal amendment to wreck it.&#8217; <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>Many local Labour authorities had accumulated debts when helping
the miners in 1926. They naturally expected a Labour Government to
bail them out. Instead they were threatened with a surcharge if they
did not settle their accounts. The miners themselves did no better.
Labour&#8217;s election promise to restore the seven-hour day was forgotten.</p>

<p>Conference had committed Labour to &#8216;full self-government and
self-determination [for India] at the earliest possible moment and by
her consent.&#8217; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> Alas, many Indians
took Labour at its word, with the result that after nine months
54,000 were in jail for civil disobedience. One MP said his
government was &#8216;responsible for a repressive movement in India
sterner and severer than any repressive movement since the time of
the Indian Mutiny.&#8217; <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p>But there was one thing the government was not allowed to forget.
Month after month, the capitalist crisis announced its grim presence
through the rising toll of unemployment. When Labour came into office
this stood at 1.3 million, or 10 per cent of the workforce. After a
year this had risen to two million. At the end of Labour&#8217;s tenure
of office the figure was 2.7 million or a staggering 22 per cent of
all workers. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p>Of course Labour could blame the economic system for unemployment.
The president of the 1930 Labour Conference said in her address: &#8216;it
is not within the power of any single country to deal with the roots
of these evils by means of any purely national policy.&#8217; <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a>
But the crux of Labour argument was that the results of capitalism
<em>could</em> be removed within a &#8216;single country&#8217; by using
parliament to carry out a &#8216;purely national policy&#8217;.</p>

<p>Jimmy Thomas was picked to tackle unemployment because of special
qualifications &#8211; an intimate acquaintance with leading bankers and
industrialists! He inevitably failed. In a private capitalist economy
government job creation projects alone, however massive, could never
turn the tide of unemployment. His schemes were in any case limited,
because the Cabinet had decided:</p>

<p class="quoteb">we must not be rushed into shovelling out public money
merely for the purpose of taking ... people off the unemployed
register ... Both for political and financial reasons, we must do all
we can to combat the present feeling of insecurity in our financial
prospects, and we must, therefore, avoid all schemes involving heavy
additions to Budget charges or grandiose loan expenditure. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p> 

<p class="fst">By the end of 1929 the government was arguing that unemployment
&#8216;must continue until the nation assent to conditions wherein
production would enlist the services of all who are capable of work,
instead of ... compelling large groups of people to remain idle.&#8217;
<a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> Brilliant! For some it was
becoming just too much. Wheatley, already a dying man, looked back on
a life of reformist politics and concluded:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In election after election, [workers] are asked not to
adopt strike or industrial action, or adopt revolutionary methods,
and not to listen to agitators who create confusion in society, but
to settle matters reasonably and constitutionally and moderately by
the Parliamentary machine ... now they are reaping the reward of
their innocence. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p> 

<p class="fst">Labour had settled down to the business of curing capitalism and
freely admitted <em>this must be at the expense of the unemployed</em>.
Thomas, who was supposed to <em>reduce</em> unemployment, said: I have
deliberately, and will continue deliberately, to proceed [<em>sic</em>]
on the basis of a process of rationalisation in industry, which must
for weeks increase unemployment figures. I have got to do this in the
interests of the country.&#8217; <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a>
However, curing capitalism was not straightforward. The debate about
how best to do this occupied the rest of the government&#8217;s term in office.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Economic alternatives</h4>

<p class="fst">There were many policies considered, but not one of them included
socialism. Attlee explained why: &#8216;We do not believe in the
capitalist system. We feel it has failed to deliver the goods and we
should like to see it ended. But the country has not yet said that we
shall end it. We have no mandate for that.&#8217; <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p>The Tories argued for &#8216;protecting&#8217; industry by imposing duty
on foreign goods. <em>Both Liberals and Labour had a simple and
undoubtedly correct reply to their critics</em>. In an economy
dependent on importing raw materials and exporting finished articles,
that meant suicide. Apart from jacking up prices, reprisals would
bring a collapse in international trade. This is exactly what
happened in the 1930s.</p>

<p>In their 1928 <em>Yellow Book</em> John Maynard Keynes and the
Liberals argued for a massive programme of public works financed by
government borrowing. During the 1929 campaign Labour lifted these
ideas (reproducing them in a form vague enough to commit it to
nothing definite). Once in power Labour changed its time. Now, <em>both
Tories and Labour had a simple and undoubtedly correct reply to their
critics</em>. Government borrowing would frighten the banks and
decrease the already dismally low sums going to investment.</p>

<p>The first Labour government had hinted at the feet that under the
pressure of office the leadership abandons its balancing act between
class and nation. 1929-31 confirmed the suspicion absolutely. Labour
behaved exactly like any other capitalist government. Snowden clung
to tried and tested Gladstonian principles &#8211; balanced budgets,
maintaining sterling&#8217;s value and free trade. Winston Churchill
described&#8217; Snowden&#8217;s appointment as Chancellor in this way:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We must imagine with what joy Mr Snowden was welcomed at
the Treasury by the permanent officials ... Here was the High Priest
entering the Sanctuary. The Treasury mind and the Snowden mind
embraced ... with the fervour of two long-separated lizards. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p> 

<p class="fst">Ultimately the most important economic alternative was put by the
TUC leaders who toyed with the ideas put forward by Keynes and
Hobson. Despite the rhetoric this was yet another ruling-class
theory. The TUC blamed problems not on the inevitable results of
capitalist accumulation but the disruptive influence of banks and
finance. In line with the Mond-Turner talks, the TUC thought that a
partnership of labour and capital could modernise industry and save
the system.</p>

<p>Other policies were discussed. Sir Oswald Mosley proposed dramatic
surgery. A former Tory MP, he was Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster in the 1929&#8211;31 administration and tipped to succeed
MacDonald. Mosley believed the economy could be insulated from a
hostile world, using the British Empire for cheap raw materials. At
home the government should undertake a grand programme of
rationalisation and public works. He later realised that the degree
of state planning required would necessitate massive coercion and
turned to fascism to provide it. But in 1930 he still hoped Labour
would carry out this programme. Finding little support in the
cabinet, he took his campaign to the 1930 Labour Conference, losing
by the narrow margin of 1,046,000 to 1,251,000. It is indicative of
the Labour left who supported him (such as John Strachey and Aneurin
Bevan) that they imagined that Mosley&#8217;s concept of planning had
something to do with socialism.</p>

<p>The ILP offered an &#8216;alternative economic strategy.&#8217; based on
<em>Socialism in Our Time</em> and the minimum wage. This has already
been discussed. It could not work in conditions of slump. Just as the
cutting of wages cannot ultimately cure crisis, nor can the raising
of wages, for this reduces the employers&#8217; rate of profit, the
mainspring of capitalism. The only socialist solution to crisis was
to smash the system based on capital accumulation. The ILP never
thought in such terms. Their left reformism was just one more way of
saving capitalism, as Fenner Brockway showed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">To increase the mass purchasing power of the people will
result in a growing demand for goods, and ... for labour; and it is
only by that method that any hope of an industrial recovery is
possible. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p> 

<p class="fst">But even the most left-wing plans lacked absolution, because all
thought in terms of reform within a national framework. The cure for
the system&#8217;s unemployment (though temporary) came when <em>all</em> major
capitalist states were forced to re-arm in the late 1930s to fight
each other.</p>

<p>It seems remarkable that this minority government, paralysed by
indecision and slump was not thrown out of office long before it
collapsed in 1931. So desperate was its situation that when, in June
1930, the Liberals threatened to vote against the government,
MacDonald told the cabinet: &#8216;We could not be better employed ...
than going down on our knees and praying to the good God that this
may happen.&#8217; <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p>Labour was tolerated because the Opposition parties wanted it to
lead the fight to make workers pay for the crisis. As the Liberal
leader Herbert Samuel put it: &#8216;in view of the fact that the
necessary economies would prove most unpalatable to the working
class, it would be to the general interest if they could be imposed
by a Labour Government.&#8217; <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s aptitude to the unemployed had been fixed since the
days of Keir Hardie. The principle was &#8216;work or maintenance&#8217;. If
there were no jobs, then the workless were to have some level of
comfort. The tiny reforms enacted in 1929 fell, far short of the
party&#8217;s manifesto and by the summer of 1930 the minister of labour,
Margaret Bondfield, was putting forward proposals for the benefit
system which ministers found: &#8216;so disgusting ... that rather than
allowing any danger of their publication, the PM insisted that each
copy should be handed in and ... destroyed.&#8217; <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a>
Nevertheless Bondfield, the first woman cabinet minister, went on to
introduce the spiteful &#8216;Anomalies Act&#8217; specifically designed to
disqualify married women who dared claim dole. The government thus
&#8216;saved&#8217; £5 million.</p>

<p>On 11 February 1931 Snowden decided to go beyond threats to
action. He told the House of Commons:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the national position is so grave that drastic and
disagreeable measures will have to be taken ... An expenditure which
may be easy and tolerable in prosperous times becomes intolerable in
a time of grave industrial depression <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p> 

<p class="fst">Snowden was fully backed by Willie Graham of the Board of Trade,
who later denounced his former ally as a traitor for suggesting
economies. The following morning the <strong>Daily Herald</strong> carried the
headline: &#8216;Britain faces a Crisis ... There must be Sacrifices! But
Further Taxation on Industry the Last Straw&#8217;. Bourgeois papers
announced that the government now favoured cuts in unemployment
benefit and wages. A few days later the <strong>Daily Herald</strong> reported
without comment that the prime minister was to meet unions and
employers to discuss the employers&#8217; demand for a one-third cut in
unemployment benefit, as well as reductions in civil service pay and
social services. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>
<p>However, Snowden had acted prematurely. The Labour leaders needed
a bigger panic to bounce the PLP and Labour movement into submission.
Luckily for them, the Liberals came to the rescue with a proposal for
an inquiry into government finances. The people chosen for this
&#8216;impartial&#8217; investigation were Sir George May of the Prudential
Assurance Company (as president), two Labour MPs and four businessmen
(including the heads of the Hudson Bay and Cunard Steamship Companies
and Lord Plender). <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p>Snowden had to bide his time and use the May Committee report to
force workers into accepting the unacceptable. Therefore the April
budget made no important changes, but Snowden warned: &#8216;I definitely
contemplate that any gap which occurs in the finance of the year
should be met by economy.&#8217; <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> Again
Willie Graham echoed his master in the parliamentary debates. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p>Since the precise details surrounding the fall of the government
have been so overlaid with charge and counter-charge we will have to
follow its development in some detail. The May Committee reported on
31 July that government finances were tottering on the brink of
disaster. £120 million had to found by, among other things, reducing
the dole by 20 per cent. On 12 August MacDonald created an emergency
Cabinet Economic Committee. It consisted of Henderson, Graham,
MacDonald, Snowden and Thomas. The first two were to emerge as heroes
of the Labour Party. The last three became the villains of the piece.
The committee&#8217;s first decision was to pursue consultations with the
Tories and Liberals.</p>

<p>Certain ideas were then put to the fall cabinet. On 19 August it
accepted economies on things like teachers&#8217; pay. £22 million was
to come from unemployment spending. The idea that the Labour
government was against attacking the unemployed is thus a myth.
Savings would come through the means test (which meant that benefits
would be withheld until claimants provided proof that they had
literally <em>nothing</em> on which to live) through raised National
Insurance contributions from workers, and other measures. From the
point of view of what followed, however, it must be noted that they
had not <em>yet</em> agreed to cut the unemployment benefit rate.</p>

<p>Until this point there was no great disagreement. Even Arthur
Henderson, soon to be leader of the anti-MacDonald revolt, had
participated in the Economy Committee. As Lord Sankey noted: &#8216;he
and I agreed to equality of sacrifice and cut in the dole.&#8217; <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a></p>

<p>It was the TUC alone that prevented complete capitulation to the
economy measures. Sidney Webb&#8217;s reaction was expressed in the sort
of elegant phrase that made him the foremost Labour intellectual:
&#8216;The General Council are pigs ... they won&#8217;t agree to any &#8220;cuts&#8221;
of unemployment insurance benefits or salaries or wages.&#8217; <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a>
The TUC General Council entered the scene on 20 August at a joint
meeting between Labour&#8217;s national executive and government representatives.</p>

<p>The Labour executive&#8217;s <em>unanimous</em> message to the
government was summed up by the <strong>Daily Herald</strong> headline: &#8216;&#8220;We
leave it all to you&#8221; say leaders.&#8217; <a href="#nc" name="fc">[3*]</a>
<a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> But the TUC resisted government
pressure, partly because it retained links with workers&#8217; collective
organisation and because it believed in an alternative means of
curing capitalism.</p>

<p>The constituency parties, the Labour executive and the PLP, which
existed merely as the means to winning government office, were
impotent spectators throughout. The TUC and cabinet were the sole
protagonists because they alone had independent bases.</p>

<p>In the battle for the allegiance of the party, the TUC proved the
strongest. Its influence derived in part from its financial
contributions to the party (three-quarters of receipts in 1930) and
sponsorship of MPs. When these factors combined with MacDonald&#8217;s
desertion, the national executive and parliamentary party were
persuaded almost unanimously to follow the General Council line. But
we are running ahead.</p>

<p>On Friday, 21 August, the TUC suggested economies based on
&#8216;equality of sacrifice&#8217;:</p>

<ol>
<li class="quote">Unemployment insurance to be paid for by a
graduated levy on profits, incomes and earnings;<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li class="quote">Securities and other unearned income to be taxed;<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li class="quote">Payments on the &#8216;Sinking Fund&#8217; by which the
National Debt was paid off should be suspended.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">The cabinet answered that &#8216;no Government worthy of the name
could for one instance submit to dictation from an outside body.&#8217;
<a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a> It did not see the run on the
pound as financial dictation, only the TUC&#8217;s defence of the
millions who had elected Labour in the first place. So the cabinet
threw out the whole TUC package. The third point alone &#8211; the
suspension of Sinking Fund payments of £50 million a year to
moneylenders &#8211; was worth more than twice the government&#8217;s
intended savings on dole payments.</p>

<p>At this stage extraordinary events began to unfold which showed
where real power lies in bourgeois democracy. The cabinet first went
cap in hand to the parliamentary representatives of big business &#8211;
the Tories and Liberals &#8211; to ask whether a 10 per cent dole cut
would satisfy them. The reply was that the bankers were the ones to
see. So Labour humbly turned to the Bank of England. According to the
cabinet minute:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It was in the Deputy Governor&#8217;s view essential,
particularly from the point of view of the foreign interests
concerned, that very substantial economies should be effected on the
Unemployment Insurance ... and he reported the view of a
distinguished and very friendly foreign financier [!] on the vital
need for securing budget equilibrium. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p> 

<p class="fst">However the deputy governor of the Bank of England would not make
a final decision. Mr Harrison of the American Federal Reserve Bank
had to be consulted. When his turn came in this merry-go-round he
said he would have to consult New York financial interests. And so it
went on.</p>

<p>One cabinet minister described the situation in this way:</p>

<p class="quoteb">One of the memories that abides with me, and I hope I
shall never forget it, is that of twenty men and one woman,
representing the government of this country, standing one black
Sunday evening in the Downing Street garden awaiting a cable from New
York as to whether the pound was to be saved or not, and whether the
condition would be insisted upon that the unemployed would be cut 10
per cent. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p> 

<p class="fst">At last the replies came in. World capitalism used its various
mouthpieces to say that big business did not care a damn about
elections, manifesto promises or the unemployed, since it had the
power to make or break governments at will. As a token of good intent
towards the wealthy it demanded an immediate and swingeing attack on
the most underprivileged section of society. If Labour could pull it
off without any opposition then all well and good, but if there
should be any hint of dissent that might encourage mass resistance,
then harder-line politicians would have to move in.</p>

<p>On Sunday night Beatrice Webb reported in her diary: &#8216;So it is
the financiers, British and American, who will settle the personnel
and the policy of the British government. Sidney hopes that they will
decide against the Labour Cabinet remaining in office ... The
dictatorship of the capitalist with a vengeance!&#8217; <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p>The actual outcome was unexpected. That night the cabinet voted by
some eleven or twelve votes to eight or nine (the size of the
majority is disputed) <em>in favour of a 10 per cent cut in
unemployment benefit</em>. This was made in the full knowledge that,
as MacDonald told the meeting: &#8216;the proposals as a whole
represented the negation of everything that the Labour Party stood
for.&#8217; <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a> A narrow majority was not
enough, however. The bankers had made it clear that the government <em>in
its entirety</em> must join in or, as MacDonald warned: &#8216;If on this
question there were any important resignations, the Government as a
whole must resign.&#8217; Having failed to secure unanimity MacDonald
ended the Labour government there and then.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Aftermath</h4>

<p class="fst">Since 1931 a myth has been sedulously fostered according to which
Labour fought the cuts and left office rather than carry them out.
The truth was not that Labour drove out MacDonald, but that he
evicted them from the cabinet even though the majority accepted his
programme. This can be substantiated in two ways. Firstly, it was
MacDonald who decided that the government was resigning. As the
king&#8217;s private secretary recorded:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Prime Minister ... told the King that all was up and
that at the Cabinet eleven had voted for accepting the terms of the
Bankers and eight against ... In these circumstances the Prime
Minister had no alternative than to tender the resignation of the
Cabinet. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p> 

<p class="fst">Secondly, a number of different writers corroborate Kirkwood&#8217;s
assessment that if MacDonald had wished to do so he might have taken
the Labour Party with him in imposing cuts:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Of one thing, however, I feel certain. If Ramsay
MacDonald had come to a meeting of his Party and told them his views
and invited them to join him in creating a National Government most
of then would have agreed ... <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a></p> 

<p class="fst">Instead, out of the four renegade ministers only the least
important &#8211; Sankey &#8211; attended this meeting of the Parliamentary
Labour Party and put up a lame defence.</p>

<p>There is one farther method to establish the truth about Labour&#8217;s
attitude to the dole cut &#8211; by measuring its resistance to the
economy package when this was introduced. The justification for a
campaign of mass extra-Parliamentary activity was obvious. As
Miliband puts it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Given the fact that Britain was in 1931 one of the
richest countries in the world, and blessed with one of the richest
ruling classes the world, it is surely amazing that there were
actually found ration men to argue that the saving of a few million
pounds a year on the miserable pittances allowed to unemployed men
and women and their children was the essential condition of British
solvency. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p> 

<p class="fst">Needless to say Labour did nothing positive to fight back, even though the unemployed were themselves far from passive. On 7 October 50,000 rioted in Glasgow; the next day
30,000 did likewise did in Manchester, and the day after 60,000 in
Glasgow. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a> The <strong>Daily Herald</strong>
was pathetic. In 1930 it had attacked the Communists for organising
the unemployed movement:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Only the reckless and heartless would accept
responsibility dragging through the streets crowds of men and women,
many of them badly clothed and fed and the great majority totally
unfit march ... And it becomes essentially objectionable since no
useful end can be attained. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p> 

<p class="fst">In spite of all that had happened 1931, the paper&#8217;s line
maintained Unchanged: &#8216;The remedy is in [the unemployed&#8217;s] hand
not in rioting and futile demonstrations, not in pointless collisions
with the police (who are also victims) but is a determined effort to
win the election for Labour.&#8217; <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a>
Even the mildest action was condemned. Teachers resisting a 15 per
cent pay cut were criticised for a ban on &#8216;out-of-school oversight
of children&#8217;s games&#8217;. The <strong>Daily Herald</strong> urged them: &#8216;to
rescind the resolution and ... rely on the polls ... to help them
secure justice.&#8217; <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>

<p>Fortunately, there were better ways than waiting fourteen years
for the next Labour administration. The best opportunity to roll back
the ruling-class offensive came with the Invergordon mutiny of 15
September 193l. 12,000 seamen, some of them threatened with a 25 per
cent cut in pay, refused to obey orders. When the issue was raised in
parliament the official Labour spokesman said the mutiny was: &#8216;a
matter of extreme regret [and] created a dangerous precedent.&#8217; <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a>
The mutiny proceeded nonetheless, with instant success. Within days
the financial panic it caused demolished the Gold Standard, the
measure which had caused deflation and on whose altar the miners had
been sacrificed in 1926. And on 21 September the National Government&#8217;
&#8216;discovered&#8217; that there were &#8216;just&#8217; grievances to be
answered. The wage cuts for teachers, police and the armed services
were greatly reduced. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a></p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s resistance to economies was not held by Snowden rightly
claiming that &#8216;nine-tenths of the [National Government&#8217;s]
economies ... were adopted and approved by the late government&#8217;.
<a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a> The October election brought
further humiliation:</p>

<p class="fst">What felt worse than the loss of almost a quarter of the Labour
vote was reduction to 46 seats in parliament and the ignominious end
of the first generation of Labour leaders. Not just the renegades to
the right, but Henderson, Clynes, Webb and many more were finished
politically. The Second Labour government broke <em>thirty years of
reformist continuity</em> and the pattern of relentless growth. Sidney
Webb&#8217;s phrase &#8211; &#8216;<em>the inevitability of gradualness&#8217;</em>
&#8211; suddenly rang hollow.</p>

<p>The Labour Party did its best to cover up the degree to which
Henderson, Graham and the other ministers had gone along with the
cuts. At the party conference in October 1931 the chairman begged for
all present to &#8216;refrain from recriminations&#8217;. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a>
The executive&#8217;s conference report spent just half a p.&nbsp;dealing
with the collapse of the government. Some delegates pleaded in vain
for a proper account of this most momentous event. But so derisory
was support for a reference back that a card vote was deemed unnecessary.</p>

<p>There were a number of explanations for the extraordinary turn of
events. The official Labour version had it that everything was
plotted, perhaps months or years in advance, by Ramsay MacDonald.
Sidney Webb described the collapse as &#8216;a single drama, in all its
developments foreseen in advance-only by the statesman who was at
once its author, its producer, and its principal actor.&#8217; <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a></p>

<p>It was true that thirty years of playing the parliamentary game
had turned MacDonald and his National Government cronies into
renegades. At the height of the crisis MacDonald told his daughter
that &#8216;all this sentimentality about workers is trash [and] the
unemployed must sacrifice too&#8217; <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a>,
and boasted: &#8216;tomorrow every Duchess in London will be wanting to
kiss me!&#8217; <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a> Snowden may have been
influenced by his wife who said &#8216;she needs no friends because she
is so intimate with the royal family&#8217; <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a>,
and so on. Yet that was hardly an adequate analysis of the crisis,
nor could it show how such characters could rule the party for years.</p>

<p>In reality, the collapse resulted from capitalist pressure and the
failure of reformism. Labour had always told voters that the
interests of workers could be advanced within the framework of
capitalism. As the economic crisis grew deeper the appeals to keep
that framework going grew louder. In 1931 the latent conflict between
the needs of capital and workers became open.</p>

<p>The demise of the second Labour government proved beyond any doubt
that <em>reformism cannot work when capitalism is in crisis</em>. No
national capitalist state can long defy the power of capitalism any
reformist administration that tries to is doomed to be tom apart by
the contradictions of its situation. The synthesis of class and
nation, which reformism represents, simply cracks under the strain.</p>

<p>The political beliefs that led inexorably to 1931 were expressed
by Snowden the year before:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Some people call themselves Socialists and talk about the
overthrow of the capitalist system. Arrant nonsense! What we had to
do is not to overthrow the capitalist system, but to transform the
capitalist system. <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p> 

<p class="fst">The <em>starting point</em> for reformism was a healthy capitalist system.</p>

<p>One Labour MP grasped the fall import of what happened in 1931.
While Labour was still in office, W.J. Brown warned that the
leadership&#8217;s policy:</p>

<p class="quoteb">struck at the very root of the whole philosophy of
constitutional and peaceful progression ... The essence of the idea
upon which this party has been built is the idea that, if you could
acquire sufficient political power in this House, you could ...
gradually transform our state of society into a new state ... The
Chancellor&#8217;s speech today represents the complete destruction of
that aim. <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a></p> 

<p class="fst"><em>Marx had looked to the workers&#8217; movement as &#8216;the
gravedigger of capitalism&#8217;.</em> It was obvious that <em>Labour
saw itself as the doctor whose duty was to cure capitalism.</em></p>

<p>The contradictions of reformism which wrecked the second Labour
government are linked to contradictions in capitalism. Reformism grew
from a specific set of circumstances &#8211; a degree of balance between
the working class and capitalists which allowed a relative truce in
the class war. Through this there emerged the labour bureaucracy, to
negotiate, politically and industrially, the terms of armistice. In
1931 the balancing act came to an end. But this did not mean the end
of reformist consciousness.</p>

<p>In a crisis, neither the bureaucracy nor reformist ideas simply
evaporated. Both endured so long as workers lacked confidence in
their own power. Labour retained strong working class support, even
when no reforms could be delivered.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the crisis had profound effects. For those on the
periphery of the Labour Party, reformism lost its attraction &#8211;
since it was unable to counter the arguments of the outright
defenders of capitalism. Outside its core support the Labour vote declined.</p>

<p>In 1931 there were three avenues open to Labour. One was to
abandon reformism and shift to the right, as MacDonald and Co did
when they formed the National Government. Another was to abandon
reformism by shifting to the left and adopting a revolutionary
outlook. There was no automatic swing in this direction since the
general mood of the class was defensive and the Communist Party was
on an ultra-left binge. The third was to hold on to reformism in its
decaying, unstable form. This course was adopted by the majority of
the working class, who now clung more desperately to Labour as the
solution to their problems.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#fa" name="na">1*.</a> A sign of Labour&#8217;s attitude was
the fact that only 6 per cent of its 1929 election addresses
mentioned socialism, while 43 per cent of the Conservatives did so
(to attack it of course). <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fb" name="nb">2*.</a> It was ironic that the very first
justification the Tory Government found in 1926 for the Trades
Disputes Act came from a book by Henry Slesser, Labour&#8217;s legal
counsel. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fc" name="nc">3*.</a> Indeed the executive did not meet
again until 26 August, after the National Government was formed. Nor
did it hold meetings to cope with the approaching crisis. Thus the
only previous discussion on rising unemployment and possible problems
was on 25 November 1930, when the executive took steps to discipline
W.J. Brown, an MP who had publicly stated that unemployment was
losing Labour votes. Just as in 1926 the party&#8217;s national
executive, as distinct from the PLP, was stone dead in the midst of
major events.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fd" name="nd">4*.</a> It is important to note that this
drop was not simply the result of the August 1931 crisis or the smear
tactics of Snowden, who viciously turned on the party which had
brought him to prominence. By-elections in March and June had already
shown a catastrophic decline in the Labour vote. In May for example,
the majority in St Rollox (Glasgow) fell from 8,000 to 1,382, in
Rutherglen from 5,000 to 683 and in Gateshead from 16,000 to 1,392!</p>
