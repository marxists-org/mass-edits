<h1>16. Labour under Thatcher</h1>

<br/>
<h4>Downturn on the industrial front</h4>

<p class="fst">IN 1974 many capitalists welcomed Labour&#8217;s election victory.
Five years later they rejoiced at its defeat. The Labour Government
had successfully protected the employers from workers&#8217; militancy.
Now the employers wanted a government less beholden to the trade
unions. They no longer needed a defensive shield to shelter behind,
but a sword to carry their offensive forward against the workers.</p>

<p>The downturn in the industrial struggle started by the
Wilson-Callaghan government accelerated. Compared with 1970&#8211;74 the
anti-working class policies of the newly-elected government led by
Margaret Thatcher met little resistance: rank and file organisation
had been undermined through the Social Contract, productivity deals
and the creation of a layer of full-time convenors acting as a
crucial adjunct to the trade union bureaucracy. Added to this crisis
of organisation was one of leadership. The reformist ideology of most
union militants could not cope with a situation in which there was
little room to win significant concessions from the system.</p>

<p>Rising unemployment added to the downturn. Workers generally lost
the confidence to take on their employers. When they did so the
disputes were defensive, fragmented, long, bitter and demoralising.
The early 1970s had been a period of victories punctuated by defeats;
ten years later saw defeats punctuated by only partial, short-term
victories.</p>

<p>This increased the domination of the union bureaucracy over the
rank and file. Union leaders moved to the right throughout the period
after Thatcher came to office. Nevertheless, when forced into a
situation where they felt they were not being taken seriously by
employers and government, they on occasion mobilised their members
for action &#8211; while keeping a firm grip all the way.</p>

<p>A series of such bureaucratic strikes began in 1980 when the steel
union, ISTC, came out for fourteen weeks in its first national
stoppage since 1926. Alas, sectionalism meant scab steel streamed out
of the non-striking private firms and was carried through the gates
of factories by TGWU lorry drivers. In the years that followed the
workforce of the industry was cut by two thirds.</p>

<p>During the national strike in 1982 by train drivers in ASLEF, the
NUR scabbed and the TUC General Council unanimously ordered the
stoppage ended. Health workers were defeated despite one-day and
selective strikes supported by hundreds of thousands of ancillary
workers and nurses. The wholesale privatisation of hospital services
such as catering and cleaning followed. Only the February 1983
national water workers&#8217; strike resulted in a partial victory.</p>
<p>In 1983 the Trade Union Congress adopted the policy of &#8216;New
Realism&#8217;. The TUC&#8217;s initial reaction to the Tory offensive had
been, if not resistance, at least turning their back on Thatcher. Now
Len Murray, general secretary of the TUC, grovelled: &#8216;We have to
put our members&#8217; case wherever we can, and that means talking with
Government ... Arguing the trade union case with anybody does not
make us an instrument, a tool, of Government or of any political
party.&#8217; <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p>However, a short time later the advance of New Realism was delayed
by three disputes. In November 1983 the printers&#8217; union, NGA, one
of the strongest unions in the country, was taken on by a small
employer in Warrington who was using the Tories&#8217; anti-union laws to
undermine the union. The TUC General Council ruled against the NGA
when it defied the Tory laws and, faced with the police and the
courts, the union was beaten at the end of February 1984. Five weeks
later the government banned civil service unions at its secret
communications centre, GCHQ. The TUC called a one-day national
strike. Despite the short notice and bureaucratic method of calling
it, there was some support. But still the government triumphed.</p>

<p>The day after the GCHQ strike, on 1 March, the Coal Board
announced Yorkshire&#8217;s Cortonwood Colliery was to close in five
weeks&#8217; time. Answering protests, the chairman of the Coal Board,
Ian MacGregor, announced his intention to shut twenty pits and
destroy 20,000 jobs within a year. The Thatcherites were obviously
staging a deliberate provocative action.</p>

<p>The struggles round the NGA, GCHQ and the miners delayed the march
towards New Realism. Unfortunately this was merely it hiatus in its
progress. After the miners&#8217; defeat it pushed forward with greater vigour.</p>

<p>Despite the defensive nature of the strike, there were times when
the miners could have broken through and inflicted a major defeat on
the Tories. That they did not do so was in large part due to the
attitude of the TUC and Labour Party leadership. There was no lack of
sympathy for the miners&#8217; cause among great numbers of trade
unionists. But the potential for industrial solidarity was
deliberately undercut so as not to justify militant tactics such its
the flying picket, or provide an alternative to electoralism. This
was why the Labour leadership&#8217;s attacks on &#8216;violent picketing&#8217;,
which they described as no better than the brutal tactics used by the
police, were so invidious.</p>

<p>As a result, the national miners&#8217; strike was both a break in the
downturn and at the same time had all the characteristics of strikes
in the downturn. It was the longest ever mass strike in Europe. But
it was radically different from the 1972 miners&#8217; strike. Rank and
file activity was lower, and, crucially, the miners showed less
willingness to act independently of the bureaucracy. The sectionalism
which had been encouraged by the Labour government&#8217;s incentive
scheme of 1977 tore the miners apart and isolated them from other
workers. In 1984&#8211;5 at most 10 per cent of the miners were active on
picket duty, and, in contrast to 1972, they had to spend much of
their time picketing out other miners.</p>

<p>This time there was little industrial solidarity from other
workers. The damage had been done. For example, in 1972 power workers
had been organised in a rank-and-file combine throughout the
industry; they were involved in a pay campaign of their own, so all
power stations strongly supported the miners. Within a couple of
weeks twelve power stations had been closed completely, and 1,400,000
workers had to be laid off in industry. In 1984&#8211;5, on the other hand:</p>

<p class="quoteb">No meetings were organised by the TGWU and GMBATU between
shop stewards in the power stations and miners&#8217; representatives.
The first meeting between Arthur Scargill and shop stewards in the
power stations in Yorkshire did not take place until the strike had
been going for ten and a half months &#8211; on 16 January 1985! <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">And on 11 April 1984 the unions in the power industry signed a
13-month agreement for a 5.2 per cent wage increase. Not one worker
was laid off for lack of electricity in the twelve months of the
miners&#8217; strike.</p>

<p>The Orgreave coke depot near Sheffield should have been the
Saltley of the 1980s, but miners&#8217; leader Arthur Scargill&#8217;s call
to repeat the 1972 victory here was not heeded. In 1972 Birmingham
engineering workers had come to the aid of the miners. But in 1984
the engineering workers of Sheffield (which is much nearer to the
coalfields than Birmingham) did not. At Saltley the engineers joined
the picket line en masse on its fifth day. At Orgreave picketing
started on Thursday 24 May with about 1,000 miners. The nation&#8217;s
television screens showed several thousand miners on the picket line
being hammered on 27 May, 29 May, 31 May, and 18 June. On 30 May
Scargill was arrested, and on 18 June he was wounded and had to be
taken to hospital. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p>But there was still no sign of the Sheffield engineers turning up
to picket. Why?<br/>

To answer this one must look at the state of the
Sheffield engineers. <strong>The Department of Employment Gazette</strong>
reported that in Sheffield there had been no major stoppages in 1981,
one in 1982 (against redundancies), and again <em>only one</em> in 1983
(over redundancies). <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> Workers who lack
the confidence to stand up to their own bosses cannot be relied upon
to come out in support of other workers. This was the basic cause of
the Orgreave tragedy.</p>

<p>It would be a case of tunnel vision, a concession to sectionalism,
to see the roots of the miners&#8217; defeat as in the mining industry
alone. They were part of a much wider picture. To explain the
industrial explosion of 1972 we have to look at the changes in the
situation of the working class in the period since the Second World
War. To explain the state of the working class during the 1984-5
miners&#8217; strike we need to look to the years since Labour came to
office in 1974. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Political upturn: Bennism</h4>

<p class="fst">The sorry state of the working-class movement had both a
short-term and a long-term impact on the Labour Party. At first the
industrial downturn went hand in hand with a political upturn
expressed in the rise of a new and powerful Labour left-wing current
&#8211; Bennism. Since workers did not have the confidence to lake on
their employers <em>in the workplace</em>, many of the activists looked
for a political solution <em>outside the workplace</em> from a saviour
on high: the Labour Party.</p>

<p>After Labour&#8217;s 1979 election defeat the party experienced its
biggest swing to the left for a generation. During 1970&#8211;74 Labour
conferences had moved sharply to the left, but the activists found
their focus in industrial struggle. Now their struggles were largely
resolutionary, against the right-wing inside the Labour Party.</p>
<p>The Labour left was convinced that there was no point in having a
re-run of the Wilson-Callaghan government. In November 1980 the
parliamentary party elected Michael Foot as Labour leader. This far
from satisfied the call of party activists for change. Nor was it
sufficient simply to pass left-wing resolutions at conference, as
they had done for years past. What the party needed, the left
believed, was a package of <em>constitutional</em> changes.</p>

<p>First, Labour MPs should stand for reselection by the local party
before every election. Secondly, the party leader and deputy leader
should be chosen by an electoral college of representatives of local
parties, trade unions and MPs, in other words by representatives of
the whole party, not just the MPs, as hitherto. These issues
dominated the Labour conferences of 1979, 1980 and the Special
Conference held at Wembley in January 1981 where they were eventually won.</p>

<p>Wembley put the Labour left in ecstasy. To quote some of their papers:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>Tribune</strong>: A watershed for Labour Party democracy.
<a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>Militant</strong>: Wembley was a great victory for Labour&#8217;s
ranks ... The block vote of the union delegations at Labour Party
conference will become a vital transmission belt for the demands of
an aroused and mobilised working class. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>Socialist Challenge</strong>: What a day at Wembley ... a
famous victory for the workers&#8217; movement. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>Morning Star</strong>: It is a momentous decision in the
struggle not only for the return of a Labour government at the next
election, but also to ensure a Labour government which carries out
the policies of the labour movement. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The left advance hinged on an alliance between constituency party
activists and parts of the trade union bureaucracy. Many union
leaders were livid with the Callaghan government whose 5 per cent pay
norm had forced them into the &#8216;Winter of Discontent&#8217;. The zenith
of the resulting alliance was Benn&#8217;s contest with Healey for the
deputy leadership of the party in September 1981. Benn only lost by a
hair&#8217;s breadth. He received 49.6 per cent of the electoral college
votes to Healey&#8217;s 50.4 per cent. Benn attracted 81.1 per cent of
the Constituency Labour Party vote, 37.5 per cent of the trade union
vote and 34.1 per cent of the PLP vote. The left was euphoric but
self-deluded. The block vote system massively exaggerated Benn&#8217;s
real support.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Benn lacked enthusiastic support from
union activists. Throughout the spring and summer of 1981 he spoke to
packed fringe meetings at union conferences. However the activists
were not in tune with the millions of union members who were
retreating before the employers&#8217; offensive, and becoming more open
to the media&#8217;s anti-socialist hysteria against its new <em>bête
noir</em>, Tony Benn.</p>

<p>Healey beat Benn hands down in those few unions &#8211; NUPE, COHSE,
FBU and NATSOPA &#8211; which balloted all their members instead of
leaving it to the political activists at conference. The only
exception was the NUM, where votes at branch meetings supported Benn.
He got the block vote of 1,200,000 members of the TGWU, but the
union&#8217;s executive had not asked its rank and file for a mandate.</p>

<p>In the constituencies the real support for Benn was measured not
in millions, but perhaps tens of thousands. In recent years the total
membership of the Labour Party has been in the region of 300,000, of
whom about 10 per cent are activists. The definition of activist is
one who turns up regularly to his or her Labour Party branch. How
small this group was emerges from the circulation of the party&#8217;s
paper, <strong>Labour Weekly</strong>, which at this time was 17,000, much of
it bought in bulk orders by unions.</p>

<p>The wide gap between the activists and the majority of individual
members was demonstrated by a survey in Newcastle-under-Lyme during
1960&#8211;61. This showed that 54 per cent of the members had never
heard of Clause Four of the party constitution, even though it was
printed on the back of every party card and though the survey was
made immediately after bitter public debate roused by Gaitskell&#8217;s
effort to drop this clause. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>

Notwithstanding all the excitement in the early 1980s, party
membership actually fell from 348,156 in 1981 to 273,803 in 1982.
Benn&#8217;s support on the ground was limited.</p>

<p>In September 1981 the Gallup Poll posed the following question:
<a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> &#8216;If the choice for the Deputy
Leader of the Labour Party was between Denis Healey and Tony Benn,
who would you choose?&#8217; The result was:</p>

<p class="fst">The internal party battles of 1979&#8211;81 were largely fought out
before a small audience: the players thought they spoke for millions,
but evoked a response from very few.</p>

<p>The character of the Labour left was another limiting factor. Many
of the activists fought their way into positions against people from
working class backgrounds who had risen to hold council positions and
had become the backbone of backward, corrupt right-wing Labourism.
However this new layer of Labour left-wingers were overwhelmingly
middle class products of the 1968 generation. Larry Whitty, Labour&#8217;s
general secretary, has described the current social composition:</p>

<p class="quoteb">60 per cent of party members have a degree or equivalent
higher educational qualification, compared to a national average of
just 11 per cent. Labour Party members are twice as likely to be
employed in the public sector as in the private. Sixty-two per cent
of them read <strong>The Guardian</strong>, and only 25 per cent the <strong>Daily
Mirror</strong>. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The chief stronghold of the left in recent years has been local
councils. Here, by tradition, the middle-class element of the Labour
Party always played an important role. Thus the Fabians, the
architects of &#8216;municipal socialism&#8217;, drew their members from the
middle class. In the 1920s medical officers of health and district
health workers were typical members, and played a crucial role in
shaping Labour&#8217;s welfare policies.</p>

<p>More important still, the constituency left has no real links with
workers in struggle. Despite the great talk about extra-parliamentary
activity, the constituencies have remained essentially what they have
always been &#8211; small groups overwhelmingly geared to elections. To
millions of workers the continuous discussion of &#8216;reselection&#8217;
and &#8216;electoral colleges&#8217; meant very little indeed.</p>

<p>Bennism&#8217;s constituency base was numerically far smaller than
that of Bevan in the early 1950s (because the individual party
membership had shrunk by some three-quarters). Yet it succeeded in
making quite an inroad into the party machine. In the 1950s the
Bevanites faced a Revisionist right arguing with confidence from the
basis of full employment and rising living standards. In the 1980s
the right had witnessed the worst economic crisis for some half a
century and the utter bankruptcy of Labour government in the face of
this. It had temporarily lost confidence in itself. A sign of this
was the splitting off of a number of MPs to form the Social Democrats.</p>

<p>The Bevanites lacked the support of any major union bureaucrats.
Benn&#8217;s successes in the years 1979&#8211;81 depended entirely on the
goodwill of a whole layer of union officials in the TGWU, NUPE, NUM,
TASS, FBU, among others. Their support was shortlived. Having
expressed their anger against Callaghan&#8217;s economic policies by
going along with a certain leftism in the party, they decided
criticism had gone far enough. Already in 1982 the left union
officials started distancing themselves from Benn, as is shown by the
&#8216;Peace of Bishops Stortford&#8217;, which they encouraged him to agree to.</p>

<p>Total dependence on union block votes had never worried the
constituency activists and the left MPs. Nor did they ever dream of
challenging the union bureaucracy. Accepting the traditional
separation of the political and industrial wings of the movement,
they discussed &#8216;political&#8217; issues in Labour Party meetings, while
leaving the struggle in the workplaces to the union bodies. Yet it is
in the workplace that workers can win confidence, can have their
minds opened to new ideas. It is here that the conservative union
bureaucracy can be effectively challenged.</p>

<p>The constitutional changes of Bennism never touched the basic
arrangement of power within the party. Thus of the twenty-nine
members of the party executive, twelve are in the union section and
five are in the women&#8217;s section &#8211; which is elected by the whole
conference, in which trade unions have some 90 per cent of the vote.</p>
<p>Union influence is carved up in executive elections according to
&#8216;preordained patterns in which representation by size and
traditional position were the dominant consideration.&#8217; Thus, if the
post of party treasurer is held by a politician then &#8216;eight
positions out of the twelve on the [union] section were automatically
allotted through customary understandings.&#8217; <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a>
What did this &#8216;understanding&#8217; consist of?</p>

<p class="quoteb">Each union had a regular custom of deciding who filled
the position on the NEC, and one of trade unionism&#8217;s oldest
customs, that of &#8220;Buggins&#8217; turn&#8221; ensured that the next in line
formally followed in succession. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Bureaucratic arrangement rather than politics decides the majority
influence on the executive.</p>

<p><em>Leaving the union bureaucracy&#8217;s power intact</em> made the
left&#8217;s constitutional changes <em>toothless</em>. They did not touch
the bureaucratic structure of the party and its actual power relations.</p>

<p>Labour Party structure makes it easy for the participants to
deceive themselves. A handful sitting in a ward pass a resolution.
This is adopted by the constituency general management committee
(CMC) and then moved at the national conference. Hundreds of
thousands of votes, or even millions, are cast for it. It reminds one
of a distorting mirror in which a pygmy may look like a giant. This
does not actually turn the pygmy into a giant.</p>

<p>Constituency activists have a lot of leeway to express radical
views, but when it comes to important decisions the bureaucrats have
the final say. Richard Crossman precisely and cruelly depicted the
relation between the two:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the Labour Party required militants, politically
conscious socialists to do the work of organizing the constituencies.
But since these militants tended to be &#8216;extremists&#8217;, a
constitution was needed which maintained their enthusiasm by
apparently creating a full party democracy while excluding them from
effective power. Hence the concession in principle of sovereign
powers to the delegates at the Annual Conferences, and the removal in
practice of most of this sovereignty through the Trade Union block
vote on the one hand, and the complete independence of the
Parliamentary Labour Party on the other. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Such considerations were far from the minds of the Labour left as
they celebrated the outcome of the January 1981 Wembley special
conference. The day after the conference, the right-wing &#8216;Gang of
Four&#8217; inaugurated the Council for Social Democracy, forerunner of
the SDP. Their formal break with the Labour Party came when the SDP
was launched in March. It radically cut Labour&#8217;s support. The
following Gallup poll <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a> tracks this
impact. It shows answers to the question &#8216;Are you satisfied or
dissatisfied with the way: Mrs Thatcher is doing her job as Prime
Minister? Mr Foot is doing his job as Leader of the Opposition&#8217;:</p>

<p class="fst">In December 1980 Gallup estimated that Labour had the support of
47.5 per cent of the electorate. By December 1981, after the split of
the SDP and a year of internecine warfare, support was down to 23.5
per cent, a uniquely low level for the main opposition party. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p>The creation of the SDP had a major influence on Labour&#8217;s
internal struggles. The Labour left were delighted by developments.
Their capacity for self-deception seemed limitless. They believed the
exit of the Gang of Four would tilt the balance to the left. In the
very short term this was the case. But it soon became obvious that
the general impact was in exactly the opposite direction. The
electoral success of the SDP-Liberal Alliance put pressure on the
Labour leaders to move rightwards in order to compete for the &#8216;middle
ground&#8217;. This was especially so after the 1983 general election,
when Labour beat the Alliance to third position only by a tiny margin
(27.6 per cent of the votes to 25.4 per cent).</p>

<p>Still Benn managed to continue to fool himself. He saw the general
election as a triumph:</p>

<p class="quoteb">... for the first time since 1945 a political party with
an openly socialist policy had received the support of over eight
million people ... socialism has reappeared once more upon the
national agenda ... The 1983 Labour manifesto commanded the loyalty
of millions of voters and a democratic socialist bridgehead had been
established from which further advance in public understanding and
support can be made. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Benn&#8217;s words did not cut any ice even with his own supporters.
Labour had received its lowest proportion of votes since 1918.
Because there had been fewer Labour candidates in 1918, the number of
votes per candidate in 1983 was the lowest ever. And these results
followed four years of increasing mass unemployment and attacks on
the welfare state!</p>

<p>The moment of truth for the Bennite left could not be postponed
for long. The industrial downturn had engineered a political upturn,
but it would not be long before the political level of the movement
was adversely affected by the low level of class struggle. The
Bennites, who fell into the substitutionist trap of claiming to speak
for workers they had not brought into active agreement with
themselves, were open to the hammerings of the media and the
right-wing. In fact their obsession with resolutions, with
constitutionalism, played into the hands of the right. The political
activists found it a waste of time and effort to relate to the mass
of the workers who did not attend the meetings where the resolutions
were passed.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Labour and the Thatcherite consensus</h4>

<p class="fst">The working-class movement is not the only factor shaping the
Labour Party. The other element for a capitalist workers&#8217; party is
the ruling class. We saw how Labour&#8217;s electoral landslide of 1945
led to a political consensus in the reformist mould. Butskellism was
born when the Tories came to terms with the changes introduced by the
Attlee Government, the essence of which were policies of full
employment, a mixed economy and expanding welfare.</p>

<p>Let us see what has happened to these three elements under
Thatcher. When world capitalism entered the prolonged crisis of the
1970s full employment perished. Mass unemployment is here to stay.
The crisis also overtook welfare. With national production generally
stagnant &#8211; in 1987 manufacturing output in Britain reached only the
1979 level and was still 4 per cent below that of 1973 &#8211; the
likelihood of business sanctioning any expansion of welfare is small
indeed, especially with £12,000 million being spent on dole payments.</p>

<p>The clearest sign of the changing consensus is nationalisation,
always a sensitive barometer of the progress of reformist politics.
Three broad phases emerge. First, there was the period before 1945
when practically no nationalisation was carried out anywhere in
Western Europe. As Przeworski explains:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Although social democrats formed or entered governments
in several countries, the global result of these first attempts at
socialization was null: with the exception of the French armament
industry in 1936, not a single company was nationalized in Western
Europe by a social democratic government during the entire inter-war
period ... while social democrats held power in Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Norway, and Sweden. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Things changed after the Second World War. In Britain and France
there was a wave of nationalisation, while in Italy, Spain and
Austria important public sectors emerged through a variety of other
government measures:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Characteristically, state enterprises are limited to
credit institutions, coal, iron and steel, energy production and
distribution, transport, and communication. Outside these sectors
only those companies which are threatened with bankruptcy and hence a
reduction of employment pass into public hands. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The post-war economic expansion not only generated full employment
and funds for welfare, it paid the cost of buying out private capitalists.</p>
<p>Once the crisis began, however, the chance of new
nationalisations, or of re-nationalising privatised industries,
became practically nil. <a href="#na" name="fa">[1*]</a></p>

<p>This has facilitated the privatisation of industry by right-wing
governments throughout the world in recent years. In France
twenty-three companies, worth around a hundred billion francs (£10
billion), had been sold by early 1988. In Spain, Italy, West Germany,
Austria, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere, the process of
privatisation has also taken place. In Britain, &#8216;in the past eight
years, sixteen major publicly owned UK companies, employing 650,000
people and accounting for 40 per cent of the state sector, have been
wholly or partially privatised, raising total proceeds of £17.5
billion&#8217;. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p>Had the stock market not crashed in late 1987, the privatisation
of the oil company BP had been expected to bring the government some
£7 billion, the water industry £8 billion and the electricity
supply industry £18 billion. Throw in the British Steel Corporation,
Land Rover and a few other odds and ends, and the Treasury agenda had
obviously pencilled in receipts of over £40 billion. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a>
No future Labour government could spend sums like this buying back
privatised industries.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s Programme 1982 was the basis for the 1983 election
manifesto. It claimed that public ownership of industry would be
expanded. The following year, the party conference passed a
resolution, &#8216;carried overwhelmingly on a show of hands&#8217;, which
reaffirmed &#8216;that Clause IV Part 4 of the Labour Party Constitution
is the central aim of the Labour Party&#8217; and called for
&#8216;repossession of all parts of the public sector privatised by the
Tories&#8217;. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p>As late as 1985 Roy Hattersley, as Labour&#8217;s deputy leader, still
asked for, and expected, unanimous support for a resolution on &#8216;the
need to extend social ownership and democratic planning into a
significant number of key organisations in the banking,
manufacturing, new technology and service sectors.&#8217; <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a>
Conference obliged. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a> It also passed
a resolution which called on the next Labour government &#8216;to return
all privatised services to direct labour and all privatised
industries to public ownership, and to repeal any privatisation
legislation&#8217;. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p>The slide began once Labour geared itself for the 1987 election.
The ambiguous concept of &#8216;social ownership&#8217; was used to downgrade
nationalisation and blur the distinction between common ownership and
Liberal-SDP schemes for employees&#8217; share ownership. At the 1987
election Labour pledged to take back only British Telecom and British
Gas under &#8216;social ownership&#8217;. Neither company would be
renationalised: instead existing shares would be converted into new
bonds, including varieties of deep discount bonds designed to win
favour with institutional shareholders. The growth in the underlying
assets of British Telecom and Gas would in accrue to their
shareholders. The fact that shares would be exchanged for non-voting
bonds, and that safeguards would be introduced against short-term
speculative gains, does not alter this.</p>

<p>At the 1987 Labour Conference the NUM moved a resolution to
renationalise all industries privatised by the Tories. But this was
now rejected by 3,869,000 to 2,397,000. Alan Tuffin of the
Communication Workers Union told conference: &#8216;By the time we get
back to power, we will not want to spend something like £15 billion
in today&#8217;s prices getting these industries back. We are going to
have lugger priorities like the National Health Service and low pay.&#8217;
<a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p>Another nail in the coffin of public ownership was the support for
wider share ownership. On Channel 4 television Bryan Gould, Labour&#8217;s
campaign manager in the 1987 election and one of the pacemakers in
the shift to the right, argued: &#8216;The idea of owning shares is
catching on, and as socialists we should support as one means of
taking power from the hands of the few and spreading it more widely.&#8217;
Gould did not shy from using the language of self-interest: &#8216;Why
should we leave all the advantages of capital gains to people who
already have plenty?&#8217; <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a> (By the
way, Gould overlooked the fact that Thatcher&#8217;s privatisation share
sales were popular because the buyers were able to make a fast profit
by selling. Gould&#8217;s support for share ownership offered no such
easy vote-catching appeal.)<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Partnership with private industry</h4>

<p class="fst">In the mid-1980s Labour policy moved from public ownership towards
state encouragement of private industry. Thus in 1986 an article in
<strong>The Observer</strong> on <em>Labour&#8217;s Plan for Recovery</em> by Neil
Kinnock &#8211; who had become party leader in 1983 &#8211; said: &#8216;It is a
matter of learning from the success of the French, the Germans and
the Japanese, who have forceful governmental agencies and use them to
great economic advantage.&#8217; <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a> His
book <strong>Making Our Way</strong> was rhapsodic about the achievements of
the Japanese. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a> In conscious
imitation, Labour would establish a British Industrial Investment
Bank, and a new state investment vehicle, British Enterprise, which
would be empowered to take equity stakes in high tech and other industries.</p>

<p>To reassure private capital, Hattersley went out of the way to
promise that future Labour governments would not impose high level of
taxation on the rich. In September 1986 he was flown to New York by
Greenwell Montagu, the City stockbroking firm to address
institutional investors. He promised them a new Labour government
would not return to &#8216;the very high marginal rates of taxation&#8217;
levied on the highest paid before 1979. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a></p>

<p>Hattersley also underlined Labour&#8217;s financial prudence. Writing
in July 1986, he criticised past Labour governments for their levels
of public spending: &#8216;We have almost always committed ourselves to
more public spending than the electorate thought credible and the
economy could reasonably bear.&#8217; <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p>To encourage private industry, even Labour&#8217;s moderate call for
exchange controls was thrown out. The capitalists would find a way
round them, Hattersley told the 1986 Labour conference, so we won&#8217;t
bother trying to institute them.</p>

<p>The party leadership wanted to avoid the <em>Mitterrand syndrome</em>.
On becoming French president in 1981 Mitterrand had attempted to
increase demand in the economy by large-scale nationalisations by
increasing social welfare. Within a year this ran into disaster:
French capital refused to cooperate and fled the country. Inflation
rose and the franc collapsed. International bankers demanded that the
government put its house in order, and Mitterrand complied.</p>

<p>With this in mind, Hattersley told the 1984 Labour conference: &#8216;I
don&#8217;t want to see the next Labour government start one or two years
of unreality and end with another two years of deflation for the
economy and despair for our party members.&#8217; <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a>
Kinnock and Hattersley did their best to push down the expectations
among their supporters that a Labour government would bring quick
economic expansion. They knew well that British industry and banking
are so integrated part of the world economic system, limiting
government influence on exchange rates, interest rates and the flow
of capital.</p>

<p>Accepting these constraints, Kinnock became a purveyor of
&#8216;Thatcherism with a human face&#8217; &#8211; a term first coined by the
<strong>Financial Times</strong> to describe David Owen.</p>

<p>Keeping inflation down became a top priority. In a speech to the
London Bureau School on 30 January 1986 Hattersley said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We will only proceed as quickly as the inflation
constraints allow.</p>

<p class="quote">If we have not constructed a mechanism which allows us to
expand at maximum speed with minimum inflation then the speed of our
reflation will have to be reduced. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a></p>

<p class="fst"><strong>New Jobs for Britain</strong>, published by Labour in March 1987,
made it clear that Labour&#8217;s plans for increased public spending
look second place to incentives to private capitalists to invest.
Above all, to advance economic success a &#8216;national consensus&#8217; was
needed, wrote Kinnock. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">We need a workforce that wants to be on the winning side,
but we also need those who can manage &#8211; and manage to make it all
work ... the days of &#8216;Them&#8217; and &#8216;Us&#8217; are gone now. We are all
in this together, and it is only together that Britain will make its
way in the world. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">To cure capitalism Labour was even willing to embrace some Tory
anti-union laws. The Labour Party and TUC document of September 1986,
<strong>People at Work: New Rights, New Responsibilities</strong>, accepted the
Tory-imposed ballots before strikes and to elect union executives.
With justice the <strong>Financial Times</strong> noted this break with
Labour&#8217;s own history:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Never before has the Labour Party, created by the unions,
attempted to bring in controls of trade union activities on the scale
proposed in the document. Never before has Labour tried to make that
control statutory, backing it up &#8211; albeit now in a modified form &#8211;
with the involvement of the courts, traditionally seen within the
Labour movement as its enemy. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In August 1986 John Prescott, Labour&#8217;s shadow employment
spokesman and a leading figure on the &#8216;soft&#8217; left, wrote: &#8216;I do
not believe it is possible or even desirable to attempt to exclude
the law from industrial relations.&#8217; <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>

<p>The Tories made secret pre-strike ballots central to their laws
because they detest strikes being discussed at workers&#8217; mass
meetings. A meeting can give workers the confidence to fight. They
can see the strength of their workmates all round them. The secret
ballot atomises the workers and leaves them prey to the capitalist
media. This is what the Labour Party now acceded to.</p>

<p>What about full employment? In 1983 the aim of Labour&#8217;s economic
strategy was &#8216;to reduce unemployment to below a million within five
years of taking office.&#8217; The 1987 manifesto promised only to reduce
unemployment by one million over two years. Since unemployment at the
time was around four million, the target was to cut it to three million!</p>

<p>Thatcher&#8217;s consensus has its genesis not with Thatcher but with
the Labour government of Jim Callaghan, with its monetarism, massive
cuts in welfare, hospital closures and cuts in housing programmes.
The consensus rising from the 1945 Labour election victory was coined
as Butskellism. What would combine Thatcher and Kinnock?</p>

<p>Consensus does not mean unanimity. Tories and Labour put different
emphases on the reformist consensus during 1945&#8211;1970. Labour put
priority on full employment as against keeping down prices. It was
more favourably inclined to the nationalised element in the mixed
economy and more enthusiastic about welfare than the Tories.
Throughout the period differences rose between the two parties and
within the parties. Similarly with the new consensus the parameters
of the debate were determined by Thatcher, but there were conflicts
within those parameters.</p>

<p>In 1988, as this book is being written, the Thatcherite consensus
is far less stable than Butskellism, which was based on expanding
capitalism. Thatcherism may be quickly undermined by a sharpening of
the crisis, disappearance of North Sea oil income or explosion of
class conflict. In a situation of extreme economic and financial
uncertainty, with the problems of massive unemployment, inflation,
and threats to the balance of payments, there will be bitter
disagreement between the Tory and Labour Parties about the level of
spending cuts, the scale of the attack on real living standards, and
the level of unemployment to be tolerated.</p>

<p>Underlying the conflict between the Tory Party and Labour party
will be deepening conflict between workers and employers. This
situation will drive workers to strain at the leash of the Labour
leadership which today and in the future will use workers&#8217; loyalty
to itself as a restraint. At the same time capitalists will be
pressing the Tory party and any future Labour government for further
attacks on workers living standards. All this is bound to lead to
conflicts within the Tory party and even more so within Labour.</p>

<p>The Labour Party will always represent a synthesis of class and
nation. The balance in this synthesis will shift from time to time,
above all according to the conditions of the class struggle, whether
or not the party is in office and whether capitalism is prosperous
and thus open to give more reforms or not. Labour is and always will
be a capitalist workers&#8217; party.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Bennism in retreat and the witch-hunt against Militant</h4>

<p class="fst">It was just a matter of time before the retreat of the workers&#8217;
movement and crisis of capitalism caught up with the internal life of
Labour. Indeed in 1981 the Labour Party conference elected a
centre-right majority to the executive, ending ten years of left-wing
control. Within weeks the new executive decided to block left-winger
Peter Tatchell&#8217;s endorsement as parliamentary candidate for
Bermondsey and to institute inquiries into the Militant, an
organisation within the party which published its own newspaper of
the same name. Then at a meeting in Bishops Stortford during January
1982 Benn, under pressure from top party and union lenders, agreed
not to stand again as deputy leader. By withdrawing his challenge he
abandoned the central thrust of the left&#8217;s previous case &#8211; that
there is no point in having left conference resolutions if the party
has a leadership unwilling to implement them.</p>

<p>1982 saw no campaign around the union conferences to compare with
the previous year. Instead there was the miserable spectacle of
Labour leader Michael Foot wrapping himself in the Union Jack over
the Falklands. On 3 April 1982 the Argentinians took control of the
Falklands Islands in the South Atlantic and Foot made a jingoistic
speech to the Commons which had Tory speakers practically falling
over themselves to congratulate him for &#8216;speaking for Britain&#8217;.
Only one Labour MP &#8211; George Foulkes, a right-winger&#8211;&#8211;dissented!
On 14 April Foot again pledged his support for the sending of a
British Task Force. Just a handful of union-sponsored MPs refused to
support Thatcher&#8217;s imperialist war.</p>

<p>Only on 28 April did Tony Benn distance himself marginally from
Foot. Even so he was careful to emphasise his agreement with the
basic assumptions on which the war was conducted:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The reality is that there is unanimity in the House on
the question of opposing the aggression of the [Argentinian] Junta.
There is also unanimity on the right of self-defence against
aggression ... I support my right Honourable Friend the Member for
Ebbw Vale [Michael Foot]. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p class="fst">At last, on 20 May, after six major parliamentary debates on the
war, a vote was forced. Thirty-three Labour MPs voted against &#8211;
less than half the number of MPs who had supported Benn for the
position of deputy leader in 1981. Benn himself had been touring
union conferences in 1981 addressing packed meetings over the deputy
leadership issue. He did not campaign against the Falklands war,
although he did address a small anti-war rally in London&#8217;s Hyde
Park. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p>The rightwards movement continued. The 1982 Labour Party
conference discussed the setting up of a register of organisations
within the party &#8211; its intention was to witch-hunt the Militant
group. At first many thought that the conference might actually
reject this. On the week of the conference <strong>Militant</strong> itself
carried the headline: &#8216;TGWU Executive rejects register.&#8217; But the
union&#8217;s leaders, Moss Evans and Alex Kitson, easily persuaded their
TGWU delegation to vote for the register, which passed by a massive
5,173,000 to 1,565,000.</p>

<p>The attack on Militant was the Trojan horse which opened the way
for the defeat of Bennism. Like the ILP in the 1920s Benn&#8217;s
supporters could not decide whether to resist the witch-hunt or not,
so they sat on their hands. The Labour Coordinating Committee, which
had campaigned for Benn&#8217;s election, refused to defend Militant on
the grounds it was sectarian. The same tack was taken by other left
groups in the party.</p>

<p>Witch-hunts are associated with retreat in the wider working-class
movement and strengthened power of the right. They are not, as
Militant leaders believed, a sign that the right fears losing control
to the left, but that the left is weak. As the political climate
lulls to the right, a vocal left-wing is seen as an electoral
liability. At the same time a downturn in workers confidence leaves a
wide gap between the majority and the advanced section who are easily
isolated and attacked.</p>

<p>The witch-hunt of Militant in the 1980s had elements in common
with that against the Communist Party in the mid-1920s, but the
differences were stark. The Communist Party and Left Wing Movement
had had far more power inside the Labour Party than Militant. <strong>Sunday
Worker</strong> had a stable circulation of 85,000. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a>
<strong>The Militant</strong>&#8217;s circulation never surpassed 12,000. The
Communist Party had controlled dozens of constituency parties.
Militant had a decisive influence only in Liverpool district.</p>

<p>In the 1920s the Labour leadership had to dissolve twenty-seven
constituency parties to get rid of the Communists&#8217; supporters. In
the 1980s only Liverpool District Labour Party and Broad Green
constituency Party were dissolved (up to the time of writing), while
St Helens, Southwark and Bradford North constituencies and the
Merseyside district were suspended.</p>

<p>The Communist Party had had great influence in many unions &#8211; the
Miners&#8217; Federation, NUR, AEU, Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers,
Shopworkers, Furniture Workers Union, mid the tailoring unions. The
Militant had influence in only one fairly weak union &#8211; the CPSA.
<a href="#nb" name="fb">[2*]</a></p>

<p>The Left Wing Movement had been associated with the Communist
Party &#8211; an organisation with an independent existence outside the
Labour Party and rooted in workers&#8217; collective organisation.
Militant had no supporting organisation outside the Labour Party.
Last but not least, the Communists and their fellow-travellers in the
Labour Party in the 1920s were centrists but did not act as a sect.
They were involved in every field of activity of the labour movement.
Militant was a centrist sect. It did not support any campaign unless
this was organised through the Labour Party or by itself.</p>

<p>Three examples. <strong>Militant</strong> made no reference to the
100,000-strong demonstration against the American war in Vietnam in
October 1968. The National Abortion Campaign suffered a similar fate.
During 1975, there is not one single article about abortion or the
campaign in <strong>Militant</strong>. The 50,000-strong demonstration in June
1975 warranted neither photo nor report. The same applied to the Anti
Nazi League. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p>Militant&#8217;s sectarianism was combined with fantastic
triumphalism. Again and again <strong>The Militant</strong> praised the
labour-controlled Liverpool Council&#8217;s housing record to the sky.

<p class="fst">The main conclusion from these figures is that, compared with the
previous administration, the record of the Militant-influenced
council is impressive, but compared to the record since 1955 it was
very poor indeed.</p>

<p>From 1981 Militant has been continuously witch-hunted. Conference
votes for expulsion of leading supporters of Militant show
graphically the retreat of the Labour left. The average votes
confirming the expulsion from the party of the five members of the
<strong>Militant</strong> editorial board in 1983 were 5,091,000 to 1,651,000.
By 1986, the expulsion of eight leading Liverpool Militant
supporters, including Derek Hatton and Tony Mulheam, was carried by
6,146,000 votes to 325,000.</p>

<p>In 1983 support for the <strong>Militant</strong> editorial board came from
unions as large as NUPE. In 1986, only the tiny bakers&#8217; and
furniture makers&#8217; unions voted against the expulsion of the
Militant Eight. The same conference, in 1986, saw Eric Heffer pushed
off the executive, his vote halved two years after he was chairman of
the party. He was being punished for protesting demonstratively the
year before against Kinnock&#8217;s attack on the Liverpool Militants. <a href="#nc" name="fc">[3*]</a></p>

<p>The axe also fell on the Militant-controlled Labour Party Young
Socialists. This paralleled the 1930s, when the squashing of the
Socialist League was accompanied by attacks on the Labour League of
Youth. The LPYS paper <strong>Socialist Youth</strong> was closed, regional
LPYS committees and conferences shut down and its the national
conference cancelled. The age limit for LPYS membership was reduced
from twenty-six to twenty-three, thus excluding half the membership.
Finally, Andy Bevan, the Labour Party youth officer, who was also a
Militant supporter, was sacked.</p>

<p>The confidence shown by Ted Grant, the political editor of
<strong>Militant</strong>, at the 1983 Labour Party conference was entirely
misplaced. He said then: &#8216;There is no way you will succeed with
these expulsions. We will be back. We will be restored, if not in one
year, in two or three years. We will be back.&#8217; <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p>The Labour left ignored the witch-hunt in favour of fantasy. After
the 1985 Labour Party conference, <strong>Tribune</strong> declared: &#8216;the
Left has never been stronger and the prospect of a radical, left-
wing Labour Government has never been greater.&#8217; <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a>
Militant wrote: &#8216;The conference, made up of delegates representing
nearly ten million workers, remained firmly behind radical socialist
policies.&#8217; <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a></p>

<p>The Labour left consistently fails to come to grips with reality.
It lives in a dream-world in which block vote millions take the place
of the flesh and blood millions outside the conference chamber and
committee room, in which the radical policy resolution substitutes
for the real struggle of class against class. <a href="#nd" name="fd">[4*]</a>
One only had to juggle the constitution a bit, pass a few
resolutions, get the right candidates elected, and the road to
socialism would then be open.</p>

<p>To the Labour left, struggle in the real world seemed irrelevant
to its forward march. If it was doing well at Labour conferences, the
weakening of shopfloor organisation or defeats of strikes could be
ignored. In 1988, after the witch-hunt and Labour&#8217;s third election
defeat, we saw the obverse of the same coin. All was gloom and
despondency. As a result the underlying resilience of class
organisation and its potential was ignored in its turn.<br/>

<h4>The &#8216;Dream ticket&#8217;: Neil Kinnock becomes leader</h4>

<p class="fst">When Michael Foot retired in disgrace after Labour lost the 1983
general election, the Bennites suffered one of their greatest defeats
&#8211; the selection of Neil Kinnock as Labour leader. He had become the
Bennites&#8217; number one hate-figure when he urged left-wing MPs to
abstain in the 1981 deputy leadership election crucially affecting
the outcome. The bulk of Benn&#8217;s 1981 constituency vote now, two
years later, swung to Kinnock with scarcely a murmur of protest, as
did the unions. The hard left candidates Eric Heffer and Michael
Meacher did very badly. Only thirty-six constituency parties, less
than one in fifteen, voted for Heffer.</p>

<p class="fst">Where union leaderships declared for Meacher as deputy leader (as
they did in the POEU, NUM, and NUPE) the unions&#8217; rank and file
overturned this. The TGWU delegation did likewise at the party
conference itself. The death agony of the Labour left battalions was
tragic. Two years after the general election defeat of 1983 the
Labour left campaign had crumbled to nothing. People like Michael
Meacher, David Blunkett and Tom Sawyer, former standard bearers for
Benn, ended up as allies of Kinnock and the right against their
former comrades.</p>

<p>Kinnock&#8217;s dominance over Labour after 1983 repeated a familiar
pattern. Practically all Labour Party leaders come from the left (the
two exceptions were Gaitskell and Callaghan). Kinnock&#8217;s proletarian
credentials were exemplary. His biographer Robert Harris explains:
&#8216;His father, Gordon Kinnock, was a miner, as were both of baby
Neil&#8217;s grandfathers, three of his uncles on his father&#8217;s side of
the family and his two uncles on his mother&#8217;s side.&#8217; <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>

<p>In 1972 it came naturally to Kinnock to defend miners&#8217; mass
pickets in parliament, violence and all:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Hon gentlemen opposite have bemoaned picketing. If they
had been on strike for five weeks, if their families&#8217; total income
was £7 a week social security benefit, if they were worried about
smoking their next cigarette, if they were worried about paying the
rent, and they saw some cowboy coming along, driving a bald-tyred
wagon without a road-fund licence, what would their reaction be? What
would be the instinct of any red-blooded man in this House, having
put his family to all that inconvenience and near misery if he saw
someone riding roughshod over his picket line? I know what my
attitude would be. In fact, I should be worried if it were not the
case. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This quotation is especially telling if one compares it to his
attack on miners&#8217; violence on the picket lines of the 1984&#8211;5
strike, when he even-handedly denounced both police and pickets.</p>
<p>From his election as an MP in 1970, Kinnock stood out as a rebel.
Robert Harris writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">If one thing can be said to have been the making of Neil
Kinnock, it was his repeated and documented opposition to the
policies of that period. It won him popularity in the Party. It gave
him a power base. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Kinnock was especially cutting in opposition to the
Wilson-Callaghan leadership. He was going to fight to defend his
party from such people because: &#8216;This mass movement is too
important and too valuable to be abandoned to careerist pimps.&#8217;
<a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a> In a debate on public expenditure,
in March 1977, Kinnock pilloried Healey and his team of Treasury ministers.</p>

<p class="quoteb">They treat the City of London as if it were some kind of
winnable Tory marginal constituency ... They think, generation in and
generation out, as their predecessors have done, that somehow there
is some deal, some kind of understanding, that can be reached with
people who are sworn ideological enemies. The sooner my right hon and
hon Friends understand that, the sooner we shall have the policies
that we need if we are to have a Labour Government that we can be
proud of. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a></p>

<p class="fst">During the five years of the Wilson-Callaghan government Kinnock
voted 84 times against the government, at a time when Labour did not
have a majority in the House. He voted against the defence budget,
twice, against the Prevention of Terrorism Act, against the Civil
List increase in the money paid to the Queen, and he launched a
tremendous attack on her wealth. <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a>
This was a far better record than Benn&#8217;s, who voted against the
government just twice, and that only when MPs had been given a free
vote on issues concerning the Common Market. Kinnock had the ideal
left credentials necessary to lead the Labour party to the right.</p>

<p>His determination to do so became clear in 1984-5, with his
denunciation of both police and pickets during the miners&#8217; strike.
He underlined his insistence that the labour movement should respect
the Tory law by denouncing both miners&#8217; leader Arthur Scargill and
the Militant-influenced Labour-controlled council in Liverpool at the
party conference in October 1985. The conference was followed by an
acceleration of the witch-hunt against Militant which included the
suspension of Liverpool District Labour Party and the expulsion of
the leading Militant supporters in the city. Under Kinnock Labour
moved further to the right than it had been since Gaitskell.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The collapse of &#8216;municipal socialism&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">With Labour in a minority in parliament and the right-wing
offensive at national level, the lefts seemed marginalised. Local
government seemed to offer an opportunity to hold power and find a
haven from the onslaught of Thatcher and the supporters of Kinnock.</p>

<p>There were more than 150 cities, towns and boroughs under Labour
control in the early 1980s, with more than 9,000 councillors. This
included virtually all the major towns and cities &#8211; London,
Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield, Newcastle,
Leeds, Edinburgh and Bradford. Although some authorities were
controlled by right-wing Labour, an influential left wing emerged in
places such as Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Edinburgh.
However the jewel in the crown of &#8216;Socialist Town Halls&#8217; was the
Greater London Council (GLC) where the party won control in 1981 and
elected Ken Livingstone as leader of the Labour group.</p>

<p>Tory determination to cut public spending meant that the
Government&#8217;s grant to councils &#8211; the Rate Support Grant &#8211; was
being constantly slashed. The government then imposed rate-capping &#8211;
limiting the ability of specific councils (overwhelmingly those
controlled by Labour), to raise money by means of the rates.</p>

<p>The Labour councils had the policy of &#8216;Three Noes&#8217; &#8211; no
cuts, no rent rises, no rate rises. But as the government tightened
the screw, the Labour councils failed to match their radical words
with deeds. They <em>did</em> raise the rates, they <em>did</em> raise
the rents <em>and</em> carried out cuts.</p>

<p>For a number of years the Labour councils declared their intention
to fight on, even if it led to breaking the law. The 1983 Labour
Conference called &#8216;on all Labour-controlled local authorities to
collectively resist all curbs on local authority spending ... using
the political and industrial strength of the labour movement.&#8217; <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a>
The July 1984 Labour Local Government conference added further
resolutions to defy rate-capping.</p>

<p>But Kinnock did not intend to be bound by this. He advocated that
Labour councils should stay in office and act within the law to
protect services &#8211; &#8216;better a dented shield than no shield at
all&#8217;, he said. None other than Ken Livingstone pledged support for
Kinnock&#8217;s position at a local government conference in February
1985, then the following month engineered the collapse of the GLC
policy of defying the Tory rate-capping law. It was no accident that
this coincided with the defeat of the miners&#8217; strike. The week the
miners went back the left councils&#8217; fightback also collapsed. The
GLC gave up the struggle. Others soon followed within weeks, leaving
only Lambeth and Liverpool to fight on. Eventually they too caved in.
Every single council pledged not to set a rate did so. There was no
repetition of the Poplarism of the 1920s. Why was this?</p>

<p>Firstly not many councillors were ready to risk bankruptcy,
surcharge and disqualification from public office. Unlike at Poplar,
the left&#8217;s faith in conference votes had meant there were few links
between councillors and the local workers&#8217; movement to give them
courage and act as a conscience against betrayal. Secondly there was
the belief that an all-out fight now was unnecessary since over the
electoral horizon was the white charger of a Kinnock government to
rout the Tory attack. Finally, there was never any understanding <em>that
local government is impotent in the face of central government unless
the collective power of workers could be marshalled behind it</em>.
Instead the move to the right justified surrender &#8211; laws should not
be defied but changed in parliament.</p>

<p>Local councils could not even maintain reformist gains from the
past in the face of Tory attacks. Thus from 244,916 houses built in
1953, the number fell to 151,824 in 1976, 86,194 in 1979 and 17,200
in 1986. At the same time local authorities sold a million dwellings
to sitting tenants under the Tory &#8216;Right to Buy&#8217; legislation. So
in 1986 one million people were listed as waiting for a council
house, plus a further 600,000 waiting for transfers. The number of
homeless families had doubled since 1979.</p>

<p>Rent and rate rises accompanied cuts. In Walthamstow in March 1987
the rates were raised by 62 per cent, fuelling large demonstrations
and the defeat of the sitting Labour MP in the 1987 general election.
Ealing&#8217;s 65 per cent rate rise led to a swing of 10 per cent
against Labour in the election.</p>

<p>While some Labour councils cooperated with the privatising of
services, cutting jobs and selling council houses without so much as
a whimper of protest, others tried to find ways round the problem.
<em>They did not face up to the need to break the law</em> but turned
to &#8216;creative accounting&#8217; &#8211; borrowing money for services now and
paying it back later. Liverpool, for example, took on debts of £92
million to Swiss and Japanese banks, to be repaid by 1992. &#8216;Creative
accounting&#8217; produced a yawning gulf between what the councils
actually spent and what they declared in the returns to the
government. The result, <strong>The Guardian</strong> predicted, was that some
local authorities faced future financial catastrophe unless about £2
billion was found to unscramble &#8216;creative accounting&#8217; measures.
<a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a></p>

<p>Everything hinged on a Labour victory in the 1987 general
election. The defeat put the councils in a grim situation. In
September 1987 the Controller of the Audit Commission forecast that
council spending could fall by a third and their workforces be
reduced by 700,000 over the next five years. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a>
Eight London boroughs were left with a staggering £300 million
shortfall on their budgets. In Sheffield the shortfall was £50
million. Straight after the election Manchester implemented a cuts
package of £40 million and Liverpool £45 million.</p>

<p>Could the cowardice of the Labour councils be justified because no
power could stop the Tories? Some two million workers are employed by
local councils, about 20 per cent of all trade-unionists in the
country. Their mobilisation would be crucial if the councils set out
to fight central government. The Comintern considered that local
councils could be a springboard of opposition to central government.
But this is not the view of reformists, who see process as dependent
upon the action of government &#8211; central and local &#8211; and not on
workers&#8217; activity. They see their main task as to win &#8216;public
opinion.&#8217; So in the 1980s they turned to clever advertising
campaigns instead of leading a real struggle and relying on the
collective strength of the council workers.</p>

<p>The &#8216;dented shield&#8217;, far from protecting working people from
the Tories, turned out to be <em>a shield protecting the Tories from
the anger of working people</em>. The reformist logic of taking
responsibility for managing capitalism, although trying to reform it,
had run its course. The experience of Labour councils completely,
although negatively, confirmed Rosa Luxemburg&#8217;s statement that this
side of the revolution socialists should be the party of intransigent
opposition. Reformism, otherwise, becomes the agent of capitalism
inside the working-class movement.</p>

<p>Not ready to defy the government, and unable to deliver much in
real terms, left-wing councillors concentrated their efforts on
presentation and on tokenism. Instead of more houses, jobs and
services, there was a plethora of committees &#8211; ethnic monitoring
committees, police monitoring committees and women&#8217;s committees
among others. These token gestures did virtually nothing to improve
the lot of women or blacks.</p>

<p>Of special interest were the economic policy units. The best known
was the Greater London Enterprise Board (GLEB). Despite the fanfares
it was a complete fiasco. Claims that its activities had created 208
new companies and 4,000 new jobs were false.</p>

<p class="quoteb">In most cases GLEB&#8217;s &#8216;investment&#8217; offered a
temporary reprieve before commercial pressures took their toll and
the companies were forced into liquidation ... On a number of
occasions it found itself supporting atrocious employers and business
people of dubious financial integrity. <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The cost of GLEB over three years was £60 million with little to
show for it. Even if 4,000 jobs had been created, this would mean
that every job cost GLEB £15,000, while London&#8217;s 400,000
unemployed were barely touched! At the outset Hilary Wainwright
described GLEB as a force which would &#8216;haunt capital in London for
years to come&#8217;. <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a> It was a joke!</p>

<p>If someone attacks you with a stick, brandishing a picture of a
revolver will not protect you much. Posturing and tokenism
disappoints everyone, and opens the door to smears about the &#8216;loony
Left&#8217; in the town halls. Failure really to fight the Tories led
Labour to become identified with the very slum housing and decaying
social services that their enemy&#8217;s policies had produced.</p>

<p>The collapse of municipal socialism was one added factor in the
marginalisation of the Labour left.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Feminism: A broken reed</h4>

<p class="fst">One influence on the Labour left was feminism. Many women who came
into political activity around 1968 turned to the Labour Party in the
late 1970s and early 1980s, a time of industrial downturn and the
disappearance of popular movements. A vast political gulf separated
the women&#8217;s movement of the early period from the later one.</p>

<p>In the first phase <em>the woman&#8217;s movement coincided with huge
struggles of working-class women</em> &#8211; the Ford women machinists&#8217;
strike for equal pay, the London night cleaners&#8217; fight for union
recognition, the 20,000 Leeds clothing workers (85 per cent of them
women) on strike using flying pickets, the tens of thousands of
teachers striking for the first time in half a century and many
others. Thus in the ten years 1968&#8211;78 the female membership of NUPE
more than trebled, NALGO&#8217;s more than doubled, COHSE&#8217;s quadrupled,
and that of ASTMS rose seven times. Women gained important reforms &#8211;
the Abortion Act of 1967, free contraception on the NHS in 1973, free
contraception for under-16s in 1974. Counter-attacks against abortion
rights in 1975, 1977 and 1979 were rebuffed with demonstrations of up
to 80,000 women and men. At this time the demands of the women&#8217;s
movement were collective: for equal pay, abortion rights and
nurseries, and the claims were against government and employers.</p>

<p>The influx of middle-class feminists into the Labour Party came
later, when the women&#8217;s movement was in rapid decline and
industrial defeats were shifting the labour movement to the right. If
the general argument for New Realism was that strikes do not pay, it
took a special form among feminists. To people like the
Euro-Communist Bea Campbell, strikes and pickets were macho and
typified the &#8216;anti-woman&#8217;, &#8216;male-dominated&#8217; working-class
movement. The focus was no longer collective, but on the individual
woman as a victim of men: on rape and other violence against women.
The theory of patriarchy &#8211; that the enemy of woman in man, that men
benefit from women&#8217;s subordination &#8211; came to dominate. Now the
women&#8217;s movement concentrated on personal solutions, on alternative
relationships and lifestyles. This naturally appealed to middle-class
women: working-class women could not afford the luxury.</p>

<p>The search for individual solutions led to fragmentation and
collapse of the women&#8217;s movement, so that its remnants shifted away
from the politics of movements towards institutional politics,
largely towards the Labour Party. Protesting against women&#8217;s
oppression, the product of capitalism, without challenging capitalism
<em>in toto</em>, they fitted very well into Labourism, which both
expresses workers&#8217; opposition to the status quo, and at the same
time blunts this opposition.</p>

<p>There is an affinity between the women&#8217;s movement and the Labour
left. First, in terms of social composition they are white-collar and professional.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Secondly, for the socialist members of the women&#8217;s
liberation movement and the Labour left, ideas are not moulded by the
collective class struggle of workers, but are seen simply as a debate
between individuals. Thirdly, unlike the revolutionary socialist
organisations, which would demand from anyone in the women&#8217;s
movement that she breaks with both the analysis of the movement and
its style of work, the Labour Party, being a &#8216;broad church&#8217;,
makes no demands. Fourthly, even in terms of structure there is far
more in common between the structurelessness and loose federalism of
the women&#8217;s movement and the bureaucratic swamp of labourism, than
between either of them and the democratic centralism of a
revolutionary socialist party. There is no party discipline, except
where the bureaucratic right find it necessary. <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Women who joined the Labour Party in the early 1980s concentrated
on setting up women&#8217;s caucuses within the party. Some became
councillors and leaders of local government: such as Margaret Hodge
in Islington, Merle Amery in Brent, and Linda Bellos in Lambeth.
Though committed to women&#8217;s rights, they had to contend with the
government offensive against working people, which especially hurt
working women. Against this they threw not an organised fightback but
committees! More pathetic tokenism. To give a couple of examples: the
chairperson of the GLC women&#8217;s unit had a salary of £18,000 in
1982. That is impressive; it gives equality to women. Alas, many
working women were lucky to earn a quarter of this. In 1983&#8211;4 the
Stirling District Council women&#8217;s committee had a budget of
£16,000, of which £11,000 was the salary of the Women&#8217;s Officer,
leaving the magnificent sum of £5,000 for everything else. <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a></p>

<p>Instead of real services women were offered &#8216;participation in
the decision-making structure&#8217;, in other words the opportunity for
a handful of middle-class women to climb socially. Initiatives on
blacks and gays, equally worthy in intention, were equally hopeless
in application. They too failed to address the social roots of the
problem or mobilise those forces that could resist the right-wing
ideological attack of press and Tory hysteria.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>New Realism: Exploiting political advantage from electoral defeats</h4>

<p class="fst">Losing three elections in a row &#8211; 1979, 1983 and 1987 &#8211; seems
disastrous to a party dedicated to office. The only comparable period
in Labour&#8217;s history was the defeats in 1951, 1955 and 1959, but
these were by comparison far less severe. In the elections of the
1950s the percentage lead of Tory votes over Labour was 0.8, 3.3 and
5.6. In 1979 and the 1980s the corresponding figures were 6.9,14.8
and 11.8. In 1983 the Tories polled 4.5 million votes more than
Labour, in 1987 3.75 million. Such majorities are larger than any
British party has enjoyed over its main rival since 1945.</p>

<p>The 1959 defeat led Gaitskell and the right-wing to blame failure
on Labour&#8217;s loss of the vote of the affluent worker. The working
class was undergoing &#8216;embourgeoisment&#8217;, they said, it was
becoming middle class. According to the famous pamphlet <strong>Must
Labour Lose?</strong> Labour&#8217;s class appeal was outdated: new industries
and full employment meant workers&#8217; attitudes were shaped by
consumer needs &#8211; the washing machine, the television and the car.</p>

<p>The catastrophes of 1983 and 1987 also produced an extremely sharp
reaction. Gaitskell&#8217;s thesis was resurrected in a grotesque new
shape &#8211; the old theory of &#8216;embourgeoisment in affluence&#8217; now
returned as &#8216;embourgeoisment in recession&#8217;. According to this
Labour needs to woo the share-owing credit card holder, the 1980s
equivalent of the proverbial affluent worker. This somersault
requires every traditional policy that is presumed unpopular to be
jettisoned. And Labour&#8217;s New Realism found its prophet in Eric
Hobsbawm, the Euro-Communist. <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a></p>

<p>Let us take the arguments in turn. One thesis was that the
traditional working class was in decline, while the white-collar
middle class was expanding massively. In fact there were still more
workers in many core &#8216;traditional&#8217; industries in 1988, such as
engineering und road transport, than at the time of the 1926 General Strike.</p>

<p>Hobsbawm falsely labelled white-collar workers as middle-class,
yet some three-quarters of them earned the same or less than
traditional manual workers, worked under similar forms of discipline
itnd came from similar home, educational and cultural backgrounds. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a></p>

<p>For the Labour leadership, &#8216;yuppies&#8217; were the symbol of the
direction society was heading. Add to this the supposed affluence of
workers (especially in the south of England) and we arrive at the
most memorable phrases of the 1987 Labour Party conference &#8211;
Kinnock quoting TGWU leader Ron Todd:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;What,&#8217; Ron Todd had asked, &#8216;do you say to a docker
who earns £400 a week, owns his own house, a new car, microwave and
video, as well as a small place near Marbella?</p>

<p class="quote">&#8216;You do not say &#8211; let me take you out of your misery,
brother.&#8217; <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But did this docker really exist? Grade One dockers at Tilbury,
the best-paid, earned a basic rate of £181 in 1987. <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a></p>

<p>Could it be that living standards were rising significantly
elsewhere than the docks? In 1985 only 3.8 per cent of the heads of
all households earned more than £400 a week. Manual male workers
earned on average £163.60 a week. <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a></p>

<p>The Tories wanted us to believe, and Labour echoed them, that a
new popular capitalism had won the masses through wider share
ownership. There were, we were told, nine million shareholders. This
was a phoney statistic. It referred to the number of shareholdings,
so that if one person owned shares in British Gas, British Aerospace,
British Telecom and Britoil this was reported as four. The Tories
claimed that their privatisation share issues had widened share
ownership, but many of these shares were quickly resold for profit.
By August 1987 British Airways shareholders had fallen from 1,200,000
to 420,056, British Telecom from 2,300,000 to 1,417,905, and Jaguar
from 125,000 to 35,749. <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a> In 1986
only 13 per cent of adults owned shares, and among the semi-skilled
and unskilled workers just 4 per cent. <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a>

One survey found that these shares made so little difference to
people&#8217;s outlook that around half the respondents could not
remember if they had shares. The group of employees among whom share
ownership was most widespread, British Telecom workers, took little
heed of their &#8216;investments&#8217; during their bitter strike in early 1987.</p>

<p>All in all the picture of widespread affluence was a sick joke.
The number of people below the official poverty line was six million
in 1979, 8.8 million in 1983, and 11.7 million in 1986. <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a></p>

<p>Hobsbawm argued that traditional working-class loyalty to Labour
was in irreversible decline, and so therefore was socialist politics.
Such nostrums were exploded by a study of the 1983 general election
<a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a>, a particularly bad one for
Labour. The party still got 51 per cent of the skilled workers&#8217;
votes and 48 per cent of the semi-skilled and unskilled workers&#8217;
votes. &#8216;Labour is ... obviously a working-class party&#8217;. <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a></p>

<p>Why do commentators think skilled workers are far more
Conservative than semi-skilled and unskilled, and were turning their
backs on Labour? It is because the psephologists include among
&#8216;skilled workers&#8217; the manual self-employed and small businessmen,
together with &#8216;foremen and technicians&#8217;.</p>

<p>Changed patterns of consumption and house ownership have less
effect on workers&#8217; attitudes than Hobsbawm assumed when he wrote:
&#8216;the manual working-class core of traditional socialist labour
parties has been transformed ... by the decades in which living
reached levels undreamt of even by the well-paid in the 1930s&#8217;. The
study <strong>How Britain Votes</strong> shows that the purchase of council
houses did not change people&#8217;s voting habits at the 1983 election.
Those who bought &#8216;did not swing to the Conservatives at all. And
while some did abandon the Labour Party for the Alliance, so of
course did many council tenants.&#8217; <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a></p>

<p>Similarly the absolute improvement in living standards is less
decisive in shaping workers&#8217; views than how far they advance
relative to the rest of society:</p>

<p class="quoteb">conflicts of interest are as much, or more, about
relativities as they are about absolutes. The cake may grow in size,
but rising expectations will mean that conflicts over the size of the
shares will continue unabated.</p>

<p class="quote">In this context what is important is that, although
average real incomes have increased, income relativities have
diminished only slightly. Similarly, while there have been great
increases in educational provision in sixth forms and universities,
class inequalities in access have remained unchanged. Absolute rates
of upward social mobility have increased, but relative class chances
have stayed the same. <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The <em>subordination of workers to capitalist exploitation is the
key factor</em> affecting their voting habits:</p>

<p class="quoteb">employment conditions are more fundamental determinants
of values and political allegiance than is life-style ... manual
wage-labourers have relatively little security of employment and
relatively poor fringe benefits such as sick pay and pension schemes.
They have little control over their own working conditions and little
discretion, being subject to managerial authority, over what they do
at work. They also have relatively poor chances (despite some social
mobility) of gaining promotion to the better paid and secure
managerial positions. As a result manual wage-earners cannot be sure
to improve their lot through individual action. Instead they must
look to collective action. <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The working class has changed throughout its history, as the
accumulation of capital leads to new industries and the contraction
of others. Still workers continue to bear the weight of exploitation
and make up the overwhelming majority of the population &#8211; in Alex
Callinicos&#8217;s calculation at least 75 per cent of all those
employed. <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a></p>

<p>Hobsbawm saw in the shift from manual to white-collar jobs the
cause of Labour&#8217;s loss of social base. But the greatest rise in
white-collar employment took place in the 1960s, a time of Labour
success, while economic recession slowed the process in the 1970s,
the period leading to Labour&#8217;s electoral disasters. <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a></p>

<p>Workers&#8217; votes reflect, though indirectly and imperfectly, the
class struggle on the ground. Chris Harman analyses the recent changes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The working class was won to &#8216;collective&#8217; values and
Labour voting by three waves of industrial struggle &#8211; that of the
late 1880s and the 1890s, that of 1910&#8211;26, and that of the late 1930s
and the wartime years. It was the experience of these struggles which
led first the &#8216;old&#8217; manual working class of heavy industry and
textiles to turn to Labour, and then the newer working class of light
engineering, motors and so on to do so.</p>

<p class="fst">Yet white-collar workers, who have recently been &#8216;won to the
collective&#8217; values of organised trade unionism, have not turned to
the Labour Party in the same way:</p>

<p class="quoteb">this process, by which new layers of workers were pulled
behind others into support for Labour, stopped in the 1950s and 1960s
&#8211; just as the massive growth of &#8216;routine&#8217; white-collar
employment began.</p>

<p class="quote">This was not because the conditions of work in such
white-collar employment ruled out &#8216;collective&#8217; attitudes ... But
this industrial &#8216;collectivism&#8217; did not translate itself into
political collectivism ... Why?</p>

<p class="quote">You can&#8217;t begin to answer that question without
remembering that Labour was in power for eleven of the years between
1964 and 1979 &#8211; the very years in which white-collar industrial
militancy blossomed. Much of the militancy was, in fact, generated in
reaction to the pro-capitalist policies of Labour in power. It is
hardly surprising, therefore, that most routine white-collar workers
and lower grade &#8216;semi-professionals&#8217; did not see any reason to
identify politically with the Labour Party. <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Workers&#8217; organisations intact</h4>

<p class="fst">The future for socialism in Britain lies not with Neil Kinnock or
any other saviour, however glossy their advertisements. It lies with
the working class. To fit in with the consensus set by a ruling class
in crisis, the New Realists have to write the workers out of the
picture. They therefore stress not only the decline of the working
class as a class, but its organisations, above all the trade unions.</p>

<p>However, the Thatcher period has uncovered a tremendous resilience
in workers&#8217; basic organisation. Unemployment has reduced union
membership, but far less than in previous slumps: &#8216;between 1890 and
1893 the trade unions lost almost 40 per cent of their membership,
and between 1920 and 1923 they lost 35 per cent. In the three years
1979&#8211;1982, trade unions lost 14 per cent of their members.&#8217; <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a></p>

<p>Among employed workers, 48 per cent were in unions in 1988,
compared with 49 per cent at the height of the struggle in 1974.
Indeed, the Thatcher period has seen a slight rise in the proportion
of workplaces recognising unions: from 66 per cent in 1980 to 68 per
cent in 1984. <a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a> The number of shop
stewards and office and school reps, rose from 317,000 in 1980 to
335,000 in 1984. <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a> One commentator
writes: &#8216;at workplace level, especially in the primary sector of
the labour market, Thatcherism often meant &#8220;business as usual&#8221;
[with] surprisingly little evidence of a dramatic halt of bargaining
power away from the unions.&#8217; <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a></p>

<p>Thus average wages have not declined. Indeed between 1979 mid 1986
workers&#8217; resilience meant they rose by 13.8 per cent for full-time
male workers; 21.1 per cent for female full-time workers and 8.1 per
cent for female part-time workers. <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a></p>

<p>Workers have often been beaten in Thatcher&#8217;s war of attrition,
but their organisation has not been smashed. Confidence inside the
working class has declined for ten years, a process reinforced with
every major defeat. Defeats breed sectionalism, and sectionalism
feeds defeat. Yet it is one thing to say that the class army lacks
self-confidence, but quite another to suggest that it has dispersed
and joined the other side. There is no place for the doom and gloom
scenario so beloved of the TUC, Kinnock and Co.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Has Thatcher won the ideological battle?</h4>

<p class="fst">New Realists suggest that Thatcher&#8217;s populist ideas carry all
before her. Nothing can be further from the truth. One has but to
read <strong>British Social Attitudes: The 1987 Report</strong> to see the
beliefs of Thatcher <em>are not popular at all</em>. John Curtice
marshals the evidence and concludes: &#8216;The Thatcher policy
revolution has simply not so far been accompanied by an equivalent
revolution in public altitudes.&#8217; <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a></p>

<p>Class interest rips Thatcher&#8217;s propaganda apart. &#8216;Within the
working class there is a large majority with radical or egalitarian
views.&#8217; The following figures about workers&#8217; attitudes <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a>

<p class="fst">The fact is that, contrary to conventional wisdom, more people
accept the values traditionally associated with the Labour Party than
those of the Tory Party.</p>

<p>Of course, despite the above evidence the majority are not
socialists. In the contradictory fashion typical of the reformist
consciousness that prevails in the working class, protest against
exploitation is combined largely with acceptance of the capitalist
system as natural and inevitable. This can be seen from the attitude
to profits: 57 per cent of the population believe we would all be
better off if industry made bigger profits, and only 18 per cent
believe that profits are already too high. <a href="#n85" name="f85">[85]</a>
But at the same time 91 per cent think owners, shareholders,
directors and managers would benefit most from the profits earned,
while only 5 per cent and 2 per cent respectively think the general
public or employees would be the main beneficiaries. <a href="#n86" name="f86">[86]</a></p>

<p>Just how far many of the people who favour economic equality are

<p class="fst">Full of contradictions it may be, but the combined acceptance and
rejection of the economic order and social <em>status quo</em> fits
Labour much more than it does straightforwardly reactionary
Thatcherite &#8216;populism&#8217;.</p>

<p>Kinnock may not like it, but the Labour Party has always appealed
most to the working class. David Butler and Donald Stokes quote many
interviews like this one in which a Stirling
worker&#8217;s wife explains her support for Labour: &#8216;I always vote for
them, it&#8217;s a working man&#8217;s place to vote Labour&#8217;. Their
research &#8216;makes it clear how very much more salient to the working
class are the ideas of class interests and class conflict. Seven in
eight of our working-class Labour supporters gave evidence of seeing
politics as the representation of class interests, and almost half
regarded such interests as opposed.&#8217; <a href="#n88" name="f88">[88]</a></p>

<p>Kinnock is embarrassed by any reference to class interest.
Instead, by promoting Thatcher&#8217;s values he makes the fightback more difficult.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>So why did Thatcher win three elections in a row?</h4>

<p class="fst">If the majority have attitudes that conform more closely to the
Labour Party than the Conservatives, how could the latter have won in
1979, 1983 and 1987?</p>

<p>First one must avoid exaggerating Thatcher&#8217;s electoral success.
Her big Commons majority is sustained by a percentage of the
electorate smaller than the Conservatives obtained in the 1950 or
1964 elections, when Labour won. In ten of the nineteen elections
since 1922 the Tories won a larger share of the votes than Thatcher
managed to do in 1983 and 1987.</p>

<p>The electoral balance between Tories and Labour is rooted, in the
final analysis, in the class struggle:</p>

<p class="quoteb">[Labour] cannot live at the expense of the mass movement
indefinitely. Though hated and feared by the Labour leadership which
craves respectability and wishes to run the system harmoniously, its
long-term electoral support lies ultimately in the radicalism
generated by workers&#8217; struggles.</p>

<p class="quote">Since Labour contributes nothing to these by its own
activity, an absence of struggle brings only temporary electoral
success. In the long run a serious setback for the class eventually
saps the source of Labour votes.</p>

<p class="quote">This happened in 1931 and the same seems to be occurring
today. On both occasions a long period of class collaboration had
been the rule among trade union leaders. Then came economic crisis
which caused mass unemployment and a loss of shopfloor confidence.</p>

<p class="quote">In 1931 the unions seemed inadequate in the face of
global economic problems. But the Labour Party had no solution
either, and while many of the best militants clung to Labour for want
of a belief in any other alternative, millions of voters drifted
away. <a href="#n89" name="f89">[89]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The same story repeats itself in recent years.</p>

<p>Industrial downturn was the prologue to the electoral debacles of
1983 and 1987. The clearest evidence of this can be found in shifts
of mood during the 1984&#8211;85 miners&#8217; strike. In February 1984, one
month before the beginning of the strike, the MORI poll found Labour
ten points behind the Tories (at 33 per cent and 43 per cent
respectively). In August, when picketing was at its height and
workers&#8217; self-confidence in the face of the Tories was returning,
Labour edged 3 per cent ahead at 39 per cent. When it became clear
that the strike was heading for defeat, the position of the two
parties changed again: in October Tory support went up to 44.5 per
cent, while Labour went down to 32 per cent.</p>

<p>The elections of the 1980s have as their background the damage to
working-class organisation inflicted by the policies of the
Wilson/Callaghan governments. Labour was in office for eleven out of
the fifteen years between 1964 and 1979. The experience of those
years was decisive in lowering the threshold of support for Labour.</p>

<p class="fst">Between 1945 and 1966 Labour&#8217;s share of the total vote was
relatively stable. Then the imposition of incomes policy, cuts, and
other measures which sacrificed reforms to save the system, lowered
the threshold of Labour support radically. Particularly damaging was
the impact of the Wilson-Callaghan government on Labour&#8217;s support
among trade unionists.</p>

<p class="fst">The memory of the Wilson-Callaghan governments meant that during
the 1987 election campaign, 30 per cent of Labour supporters no
longer believed the party&#8217;s promises, according to opinion polls.
As the crisis made all governments turn on the majority of voters, so
over the past two decades there has been disenchantment with both
major parties: &#8216;the proportion of the electorate claiming an
attachment to any of the political parties has fallen remarkably from
44 per cent in 1964 to around 20 per cent in the mid-1980s.&#8217; <a href="#n90" name="f90">[90]</a>
Millions of votes are cast, but with less and less conviction.</p>

<p>An extra nail in Labour&#8217;s electoral coffin is its remarkable
skill at <em>snatching defeats from the jaws of victory</em>. Thatcher
has slid on banana skins time and again, but each time Kinnock has
managed to prevent her from falling.</p>

<p>For example, in April 1986 the US launched an air attack on Libya
from British bases. About ten days later the disaster at the Russian
Chernobyl nuclear plant showered parts of Britain with radioactivity.
The Tory government handled both events badly. Polls showed these two
events badly dented the popular support for Thatcher. That month MORI
found Tory support was at 28 per cent, while Labour was at 38.5 per cent.</p>

<p>What was Kinnock&#8217;s reaction to these opportunities? On Libya he
declared: &#8216;Gadafi is without doubt a malignancy who is sponsoring
and financing terrorism throughout the world&#8217;, and called for
&#8216;imposition of economic sanctions and the denial of credits and
subsidised foodstuffs from the EEC to Libya. <a href="#n91" name="f91">[91]</a>
On the nuclear industry Kinnock wanted a &#8216;pause before any further
decisions are taken about the future of nuclear power in Britain.&#8217;
<a href="#n92" name="f92">[92]</a> How radical!</p>

<p>When Labour tried to look more imposing it was sabotaged by its
own record in government. On 19 June 1986, when Kinnock called for
economic sanctions against South Africa, Thatcher quoted the
statement of the Labour government&#8217;s UN representative, who had
voted against full mandatory economic sanctions in 1978 &#8216;because. .
.we do not agree that the far-reaching economic measures which the
resolution calls for would produce the changes in South Africa which
we would like to see.&#8217; <a href="#n93" name="f93">[93]</a> When
Hattersley tried again Thatcher quoted his statement as minister of
state at the Foreign Office on 7 July 1976: &#8216;I do not believe that
the policy of general economic sanctions would be in the interests
either of the British people or of South Africa.&#8217; <a href="#n94" name="f94">[94]</a>
Whatever the issue, a battery of damning quotations lies to hand.</p>
<p>This combines with Labour&#8217;s attempt to chase respectability, to
make Kinnock a mighty gladiator when smashing his own left-wing, but
a meek little mouse when facing Thatcher. Labour MPs may complain
here and there about her actions but the leadership is wretchedly
defensive and apologetic.</p>

<p>With all the slick election broadcasts, with all the razzamatazz
in 1987, &#8216;Neil&#8217; added only 3.2 per cent to the election vote
achieved by Michael Foot. But instead of Kinnock being blamed by his
party for the defeat, he became its chief beneficiary.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Labour Party in 1987</h4>

<p class="fst">Kinnock used the 1987 election result to consolidate his position
over the left, introducing &#8216;one member one vote&#8217; in the election
of parliamentary candidates. This was portrayed as an extension of
democracy, but in fact it was designed to undermine the left-wing of
constituency activists (a term of abuse in recent years). The party
leadership will appeal to the passive membership over the heads of
the activists; in reality they will allow the Tory media decisive
influence in setting the terms of the debate.</p>

<p>The contrast between the active and overwhelming majority of
passive members in the Labour Party is staggering. The party paper
<strong>Labour Weekly</strong> could raise a circulation of only 17,000 from an
official membership of 300,000 individuals. In 1987 only 8.4 per cent
of members had attended the last round of selection meetings (in
London only 5.8 per cent) to choose election candidates. &#8216;In 205
constituency Labour Parties, almost a third of the constituencies in
Great Britain, less than thirty people attended to select the
parliamentary candidate. In eleven, there were ten or less people in
attendance.&#8217; <a href="#n95" name="f95">[95]</a> These figures refer
not only to delegates from Labour Party branches, to the General
Management Committees, but also to the trade union branches!</p>

<p>At the 1987 party conference Kinnock&#8217;s straightforward
one-member-one-vote selection of parliamentary candidates was
rejected by the TGWU general secretary Ron Todd and other union
leaders, who warned against weakening traditional links with the
unions. So a compromise was reached establishing an electoral college
in each constituency designed to retain the union voice in
constituency politics.</p>

<p>The right&#8217;s easy victory was facilitated by the character of the
Labour left. The politics of conference resolutions and vying for
position failed to involve workers in struggle, it also failed to
activate even the bulk of Party members. Reformist parties breed
passivity, and passive members do not give their leaders much trouble.</p>

<p>Kinnock laid the 1987 election defeat at the door of the hard
left, gays and blacks. The last group in particular had organised
independent caucuses within the party to combat the prevailing
prejudice-ideas of capitalism &#8211; which Labour inevitably includes as
a capitalist workers&#8217; party. But in blaming the caucuses for the
party&#8217;s electoral problems the right wing forgets that minority
viewpoints have always existed in the Labour Party (though with
little hope of success). In the past they did not prevent elections
being won, just so long as Labour could deliver popular reforms.</p>

<p>After the 1987 election Kinnock initiated a comprehensive review
of all Labour&#8217;s policies in an attempt to increase its appeal to
voters &#8211; a rightward shift proposed by &#8216;a leader who fought the
recent election on the least socialist programme since the war&#8217;(!),
as the <strong>Financial Times</strong> put it. <a href="#n96" name="f96">[96]</a></p>

<p>At the 1987 Labour Party conference Kinnock did nothing to renew
the delegates&#8217; battered enthusiasm. Kinnock and his blue-eyed boy,
Bryan Gould, argued that the only way to beat the Tories is to copy
the policy that gave Thatcher three election successes. It is not
much fun to be told that the only hope is to imitate the hated enemy.
Norman Tebbit boasted to the Tory conference a week later that Labour
was already &#8216;half intent on half-heartedly adopting our policies.&#8217;
The <strong>Independent</strong> reported from the Tory conference:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The office-seeking wing of the Labour Party was now
anxious to let it be known that they accepted what the Conservatives
had done and that they were willing to live with it in &#8216;the
post-Thatcher era&#8217;. The sale of council houses, reform of the trade
union movement, denationalisation and wider share ownership had all
become firmly entrenched.</p>

<p class="quote">Mr Tebbit mocked Neil Kinnock, struggling into Mrs
Thatcher&#8217;s 1983 outfit only to see her wearing an even more radical
and appealing style. <a href="#n97" name="f97">[97]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Gould suggested that Labour should &#8216;leapfrog Thatcherism&#8217; by
advocating &#8216;shares for all&#8217; to &#8216;appeal to the self-interest of
those whose vote we need&#8217;. Kinnock spelt out the new line thus: &#8216;an
appeal to electors as individuals rather than as members of a class
or other collective interest&#8217;; in other words, Labour should
attract votes on much the same individualistic basis as the Tories do
when appealing to workers.</p>

<p>In conference debates on foreign policy and defence Kinnock
extolled the peace-loving efforts of US president Reagan (and drew
cheers!) He signalled a retreat from unilateralism, the most holy
tenet of Labour&#8217;s creed. Next time Labour would have a defence
policy that would do no more than &#8216;enhance the prospect of removing
reliance on nuclear weapons.&#8217; <a href="#n98" name="f98">[98]</a> He
was greatly assisted by Joan Ruddock, the new Deptford MP and former
chair of CND. (CND was another movement that thought Labour would be
a convenient bed to lie on, but when it got there discovered itself
in a coffin). During the defence debate, she stated that Britain
should use Trident as a bargaining-counter to persuade the Russians
to scale down their nuclear weapons. This was a move to multi-lateral
nuclear disarmament.</p>

<p>In a radio interview Kinnock repeated the idea. Asked whether this
was not a multilateralist approach, he said: &#8216;I don&#8217;t think
anybody should get hung up about the words. I&#8217;d be delighted to be
part of a multi-lateral move.&#8217; <a href="#n99" name="f99">[99]</a>
What, asked a later interviewer, if multilateralism failed? &#8216;We
must be part of NATO. By definition, because it is a nuclear pact, we
will be part of a nuclear pact.&#8217; <a href="#n100" name="f100">[100]</a></p>

<p>Kinnock met with hardly any resistance to his moving Labour
rightwards. Indeed the main threat to his position was that the
Labour right wing might apply his own electoral logic to Kinnock
himself, replacing him with a more &#8216;effective&#8217; leader chosen from
their own ranks.</p>

<p>The climate of defeat which pervades the working class movement
explains the &#8216;don&#8217;t rock the boat&#8217; atmosphere which has allowed
Kinnock to ride roughshod over the Labour left. The defeats of
workers in struggle, the climax of which was the miners&#8217; strike,
<em>were not inevitable</em>. The defeats reflect the <em>cowardice and
treachery of the trade union officials and Labour Party</em>, the
people who at present lead, or rather mislead, the working class
movement. But these defeats helped to undermine the base and morale
of the left. Kinnock could plausibly argue that Labour should follow
the centre of political gravity rightwards. Even those who dislike
the new direction have smothered their doubts in the hope that voters
will respond <em>next time</em>.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Full circle</h4>

<p class="fst">The Labour Party has always argued that politics is about
elections and which party forms the government. However history shows
that reforms depend less on the colour of the government than the
state of the economy and the strength of the working class. In the
1950s the Tories expanded the welfare state. In the 1970s Labour
introduced monetarism. Governments made a difference but were not
decisive. In the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s there seemed to be clear
alternatives to the slump: reflation through Keynesian demand
management, supported by nationalisation and matched by welfare
policies. In the crisis of the 1970s and 1980s all this has changed.
In the 1980s there is no room for reform. Labour or Tory governments
will try to make workers pay for the economic crisis.</p>

<p>The Labour Party, like all other social democratic parties, finds
itself without a distinctive alternative of its own as it faces the
crisis of international capitalism. If it came to office, it would be
forced to behave like the Tories. Neither nationalisation nor radical
wealth redistribution policy would be feasible. Even to attempt major
reflation as a means of ensuring profits and encouraging investment
would be fraught with dangers. The Mitterrand syndrome hangs like a
cloud over Labour&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>The Labour Party has come full circle. It started as hardly
different in terms of policies and ideology from the open bourgeois
party predominant at that time &#8211; the Liberals, and it ends as an
imitation of the predominant capitalist party of the present &#8211; the
Tories. The verbosity, vacuity and woolliness of Ramsay MacDonald and
of Neil Kinnock are uncannily similar. This is not a simple return to
its past. The infant and the geriatric have a lot in common, but what
distinguishes them is that one has a future, and for the other the
best times are behind.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the Labour Party&#8217;s weakness in its infancy, its
birth was a step forward, part of the forward march of the British
working class. Now the Labour Party is a complete and absolute
impediment on the further development of this class. The ideological
and political shapelessness of the Labour Party was the by-product of
a rising workers&#8217; struggle and its partial defeat. The conservative
nature of the Labour Party under Thatcher is the by-product of the
defeat inflicted on workers&#8217; struggle by the Labour Government
itself, under Wilson and Callaghan.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#fa" name="na">1*.</a> There can be isolated exceptions
to this. Fran&#231;ois Mitterrand attempted extensive nationalisation in France in the early
1980s but was quickly forced to beat a retreat. On the other hand, in
crisis situations even right-wing governments may feel constrained to
nationalise collapsing businesses &#8211; as has been the case in
Pinochet&#8217;s Chile.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fb" name="nb">2*.</a> This is a union of low-paid civil
servants whose membership is young. A survey published m May 1986
showed that 44 per cent were under the age of 26. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a>
Figures for job turnover are management data and not released, but
much has been made by the CPSA of the fact that some DHSS offices in
London have had a turnover of more than 100 per cent per year.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fc" name="nc">3*.</a> Heffer&#8217;s vote in the election
for the executive in 1983 was 538,000, in 1984 520,000, in 1985
414,000, in 1986 251,000, and in 1987 187,000.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fd" name="nd">4*.</a> The Socialist Workers Party tried
to come to terms with the changing situation by constantly
reassessing the actual balance of class forces and adapting its
activity to this. Recognising the downturn after 1974 was not a
simple process and the debate was long and difficult. Only experience
can prove whether a sneeze is the prelude to pneumonia or only a
light cold. The same applies with still more force to the molecular
process linking shopfloor developments, general politics and working
class consciousness. With hindsight it is clear that the correct
judgement of the situation after 1974 provided the basis for the SWP
to continue as an autonomous revolutionary socialist force. Alas,
many independent socialist groups evaded the harsh reality of the
period and escaped into the Labour Party only to face the onslaught
of Kinnockism.</p>
