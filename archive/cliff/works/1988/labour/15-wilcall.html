<h3>The Labour Party</h3>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h1>15. The Labour Government of 1974&#8211;79</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">HEATH CALLED the general election of February 1974 in desperate
circumstances. He had lost the 1972 miners&#8217; strike and tried his
best to defeat their second strike, which began earlier that month.
The country was plunged into black-outs and a three-day working week.
The Tories put a simple question to the electorate: &#8216;Who rules
Britain?&#8217; When the lights went out it was obvious that the working
class had the potential to rule, but the parliamentary system does
not work that way. In the polling booths the choice was whether to
put a cross against the Labour or Tory candidates.</p>

<p>The Tory offensive had brought a political generalisation among
workers. What the workers were against was clear: against incomes
policy, against anti-union legislation, against the Tories. But what
were the majority of them <em>for</em>? The answer was still Labour.
Not that they were enthusiastic about it. Many illusions had
evaporated under the 1964&#8211;70 Labour government. But the only
positive answer that most workers were conscious of was the election
of another Labour Government. Workers had blunted and driven off the
Tory attack <em>without breaking with their predominantly reformist politics</em>.</p>

<p>The resultant Labour government disrupted the pattern of growing
workers&#8217; struggle:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In the years 1968&#8211;74 there was an unstable balance
between the political generalisation on the employers' side &#8211;
incomes policy and industrial relations legislation &#8211; and the
industrial militancy on the workers' side. Such a situation cannot
last for long. The unstable equilibrium can lead to one of two
outcomes: to political generalisation of the industrial militancy, or
to the decline of sectional militancy.</p>

<p class="quote">In fact the unstable equilibrium in the following few
years was destroyed by the policies dominating the British working
class &#8211; Labourism &#8211; the nature of which is summed up in the
banner of the Kent NUM: a miner outlined against a pithead and
looking towards the Houses of Parliament. This is the essence of what
Labourism represents in the relations between industrial action and
politics. The logic of this dichotomy between economics and politics
is that if workers have a claim that brings them up against a Tory
government, there is the alternative of a Labour government. But if
the claim brings them headlong against a Labour government they have
no alternative but to retreat. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When the Attlee government dampened postwar militancy, at least
this was bought off with reforms. The 1974&#8211;79 government did not
even have these to offer.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The bankruptcy of Keynesianism</h4>

<p class="fst">Keynes had formulated his theories in the 1930s, at a time of high
unemployment and falling prices. He and his followers assumed a
trade-off between inflation and unemployment: that cutting
unemployment might to some extent push the level of prices upwards,
while rising unemployment would push prices down again. The modest
price rises associated with the thirty years of full employment
between 1939 and 1969 seemed to justify this analysis. (This is not
the place to discuss whether the post-war boom was mainly the result
of the massive arms expenditure).</p>

<p>The trade-off between unemployment and inflation had been
formulated arithmetically by Professors Phillips and Paish: when the
unemployment rate was 2.5 per cent, wages would rise at about the
same annual rate as productivity &#8211; 3 per cent or so &#8211; and the
price level would therefore be stable. But the 1970s exploded the
Phillips-Paish theorem. In the 1950s unemployment had been generally
1 per cent or lower. It began climbing in the 1960s and in most years
since then has been far above the 2.5 per cent Phillips and Paish
believed to be the level at which inflationary pressure would cease.
Instead inflation <em>accelerated</em> from an average of only between
2 and 3 per cent in the 1950s to between 3 and 4 per cent m the 1960s
and to annual rates of 10 per cent and often more in in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Taking the general level of prices in January 1974 as 100, then by
December 1974 it had risen to 117.4; by December 1975 it had jumped
to 146.1; and by December 1976 to 166.8. From the beginning of the
1970s there were short inflationary booms in which unemployment fell
slightly, followed by deep, more protracted slumps in which inflation
dropped only marginally, and unemployment hit the roof. This is what
the economists call &#8216;stagflation&#8217;. A reflation of the economy
will feed inflation more than it will cut unemployment.</p>
<p>Stagflation was generated by the massive arms spending of the
Vietnam War, the ability of multinationals to offset the falling rate
of profit by raising their prices, and the bailing out of large
bankrupt companies by the national state for fear of economic and
social instability.</p>

<p>This combination of recession and reflation swept the Labour
leaders off their feet. Keynesianism gave way to monetarism.
Butskellism was replaced &#8211; to use Stuart Holland&#8217;s word &#8211; by
&#8216;Howleyism&#8217;: a combination of the monetarist policy common to the
Labour chancellor Denis Healey and the Tory chancellor Geoffrey Howe.
<em>Thatcher's policies took shape before she was elected</em>, for, in
the words of Peter Riddell, political editor of the <strong>Financial
Times</strong>: &#8216;If there has been a Thatcher experiment, it was
launched by Denis Healey.&#8217; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p>Now Keynesianism was put on its head: the way to cut unemployment
was to cut inflation. Prime minister Harold Wilson told the 1975
conference of the National Union of Mineworkers:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Inflation is causing unemployment ... The more inflation
we have the more unemployment we have. And if we were to tolerate the
rates of inflation reached in recent months, then no industry would
be secure, no job safe ... Lose the battle against inflation and the
battle for full employment is lost before you begin. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Economic history had to be re-written. This is what Callaghan told
the 1976 Labour Party conference just after he took over from Wilson
as prime minister:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We used to think you could spend your way out of a
recession, and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting
government spending. I tell you in all candour that that option no
longer exists, and that in so far as it ever did exist, it only
worked on each occasion since the war by injecting a bigger dose of
inflation into the economy, followed by a higher level of
unemployment as the next step. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Little freedom of manoeuvre for Labour government</h4>

<p class="fst">The massive development of the multi-nationals, the enormous
volume of mobile capital that can be switched from one country to
another at the press of a button, has made nonsense of attempts by
reformist governments to pursue national policies in isolation.
&#8216;Keynesianism &#8211; or reformed capitalism &#8211; in one country&#8217; is
no more practical than socialism in one country.</p>

<p>Furthermore, British capitalism has been declining steadily
relative to other capitalisms for a century. No government has
managed to arrest the decline in Britain&#8217;s share of world trade
which stood at 33.2 per cent in 1899, 22.9 per cent in 1929, 21.3 per
cent m 1937, 25.5 per cent in 1950, 16.5 per cent in 1960,10.8 per
cent in 1970 and 9.7 per cent in 1979.</p>

<p>As these figures demonstrate, the decline accelerated in the three
decades after 1945, a time of the longest and most rapid period of
continuous expansion of world capitalism. True, at this time, in
&#8216;absolute terms the British economy has never been so prosperous,
nor has it ever expanded so fast&#8217;, <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
but its growth was significantly below all other major capitalist countries:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In terms of Gross Domestic Product per head Britain
slipped from ninth in 1961 to thirteenth in 1966 and fifteenth in
1971. By 1976 Britain was eighteenth, having fallen behind not just
the United States, Canada and Sweden, but Iceland, France, Finland,
Austria and Japan as well. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The underlying cause lay in &#8216;persistently low levels of
investment&#8217; which ran at half the levels in competing countries. In
1978 it was estimated:</p>

<p class="quoteb">that the fixed assets per worker in manufacturing in the
United Kingdom were only &#163;7,500, compared with &#163;23,000 in West
Germany and &#163;30,000 in Japan. Whereas in 1870 Britain enjoyed the
highest productivity level amongst the major capitalist economies, by
1970 Britain had one of the lowest. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Labour took office at a time of world economic crisis in which
unemployment and accelerated inflation went hand in hand. In Britain
the rate of inflation rose from 10.2 per cent in 1973 to 24.6 per
cent in 1975. The balance of payments deteriorated from a deficit of
&#163;923 million in 1973 to &#163;3,565 million in 1974 on the current
account. Unemployment, which had been half a million in 1974, reached
a million in mid-1975 and 1.6 million a year later. Internally,
British capitalism was weak. Externally it was constrained by those
who controlled international credit &#8211; the Arab governments with
massive petro-dollar surpluses, the central banks and the IMF.</p>

<p>To improve Britain&#8217;s competitiveness the government increased
the exploitation of the workers. As Healey told the annual dinner of
the CBI in 1974: &#8216;I can assure you that the Government has no
intention of destroying the private sector or encouraging its decay.&#8217;
It was not the rich, after all, who were going to be squeezed &#8216;till
the pips squeak&#8217;, to use Healey&#8217;s own oft-quoted phrase. On the
contrary, the government wanted &#8216;a private sector which is
vigorous, alert, imaginative and profitable.' <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Promises of radical measures ditched</h4>

<p>In this situation, even if the right-wingers who controlled the
government had been enthusiastic about the bold policies of the
Alternative Economic Strategy, their implementation would have been
blocked by the massive pressure of international capitalism. Big
business and the City clamoured for the economy to be deflated. The
Treasury collaborated with the International Monetary Fund to reshape
the policies of the elected but &#8216;profligate Labour Government&#8217;.
As Joel Barnett, chief secretary to the Treasury remembers:</p>

<p class="quoteb">there were some senior Treasury officials who felt more
strongly than others that the IMF was needed to keep a check on this
profligate Labour government ... There are some who suspect sabotage
by at least one official, senior official ...</p>

<p class="fst">US Treasury secretary William Simon got the message &#8211; &#8216;be tough&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The people in the Bank of England and the people in the
UK Treasury knew what had to be done. While they would never say it,
because they were fiercely loyal, I think that they were secretly
rooting for us, that we would hold fast our ground. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">That fierce loyalty of civil servants was in the service of one
master &#8211; the interests of capital.</p>

<p>The CBI intervened directly in government affairs on behalf of big
business. Campbell Adamson, director-general of the Confederation of
British Industry, the CBI, recounts:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I remember going through with the council at one meeting
a whole list of actions that our side might have to take if Benn
really got his way in a White Paper ... We certainly discussed an
investment strike ... the possibility of industry withholding its
investment. But we also discussed various things about not paying
various taxes, and a list &#8211; I don&#8217;t know that I want to be very
specific &#8211; but a list of things which in themselves would not have
been legal. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The CBI never had to act on its threat. What nationalisation
measures were undertaken were few and not part of an overall
nationalisation strategy. When British Leyland faced bankruptcy, the
National Enterprise Board (NEB) took it over. The same happened to
Ferranti, the machine tool company Alfred Herbert, and International
Computers (ICL). Once Ferranti&#8217;s profitability had been restored it
was handed back to private enterprise in 1978. To use Bernard
Donoghue&#8217;s words: &#8216;The NEB became a convenient casualty ward for
firms the Government wished to rescue from bankruptcy.&#8217; <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p>Labour also bailed out the shipyards:</p>

<p class="quoteb">to the great relief of the private owners who, while
remaining the staunchest supporters of the Tory party and denouncing
public ownership in all its forms, were in nearly every case ready to
take the Labour Government&#8217;s cash for their near bankrupt yards.
<a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">What happened to the &#8216;planning agreements&#8217;? Draconian
government measures by compulsory means were replaced by a voluntary
system. In fact &#8216;system&#8217; is an exaggeration. Just one company &#8211;
Chrysler &#8211; actually signed a planning agreement. The insult was
that the government gave Chrysler &#163;162.5 million when the company
threatened to close its factory. As Wilson said: &#8216;the Labour
Government [had] been presented with a pistol at its head&#8217;. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a>
This did not prevent Chrysler pursuing the traditional business
practice of &#8216;take the money and run&#8217;. It sacked 8,000 workers,
and at the end, in July 1978, sold Chrysler UK to the Peugeot-Citroen
motor company, without even telling the government until the deal was
signed. Some planning agreement!</p>

<p>Farce gave way to tragedy. Instead of economic reflation we got
cuts in government spending, cuts and more cuts; cuts in the November
1975 budget; further cuts in April 1975, February 1976, and the most
swingeing axe-blows in July and December 1976. Public spending levels
were reduced in 1976-8 by an incredible 9.5 per cent in real terms
after allowing for inflation. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> No
area of welfare was safe. Tens of hospitals closed and schools,
houses and roads suffered. Nothing Thatcher did later matched the
carnage wrought by Labour in 1977.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Incomes policy once more</h4>

<p class="fst">Capitalist pressure did not cease with Labour&#8217;s spending cuts.
These could only tamper with the economic problems facing Britain. A
more important task for capitalism was the reduction of wages. Since
the war this had been Labour&#8217;s special talent. The Tories were not
nearly so adept, as the following graph shows:</p>

<p class="sm1">Real wage settlements and incomes policies 1949&#8211;1981 <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">Now the Social Contract came into its own, not only as a means of
attacking wages, but also of stabilising British capitalism in its
most dangerous period since the 1920s. The policy of collaboration
between the union bureaucrats and the government was effective in
restraining workers. All the union leaders&#8217; talk about 'the
national interest&#8217; could mean only one thing &#8211; if Britain was to
catch up in the international race, it would have to do so <em>at the
expense of the workers</em>. Even when speeches were at their most
radical, <strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme 1973</strong> had left the door open to
such a move.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The choice is either for a great contract between
government, industry and the trade unions, with all three parties
prepared to make sacrifices to achieve agreement on a strategy to
deal with the problems of rising prices; or else an interminable
debilitating inflation which will help nobody ...</p>

<p class="fst">Once more the idea that a Labour government could be a neutral
agency straddling the class/nation divide was proved nonsense. Labour
could not control the CBI, the IMF or even its own Treasury
officials, but the Social Contrick (as it was called) gave it control
over the workers.</p>

<p>On 1 July 1975 a fixed flat-rate wage increase of &#163;6 (for those
on incomes up to &#163;8,500) was introduced, with a statutory
twelve-month interval between awards. The &#163;6 amounted to about 10
per cent of average wages at the time, while the rate of inflation
was 24.2 per cent. The TUC General Council complied, and Healey gave
it high praise:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the most impressive thing has been the speed with which
members of the General Council have themselves reached a voluntary
agreement on a limit to pay ... which will mean some reduction in
real take home pay for the majority, though by no means all of its members.</p>

<p class="quote">I do not think there has been any previous occasion in
the history of this country, nor maybe any other country, in which
the trade union movement of its own will has not only agreed to such
a policy but has agreed it in very great detail. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Not a single union challenged this phase of the incomes policy. On
1 August 1976 stage two of the incomes policy was introduced: a 4.5
per cent increase in wages &#8211; at a time that the rate of inflation
was 16.5 per cent. Again this meant a serious cut in real wages. Yet
again not a single union officially challenged it.</p>

<p>But there were limits to how much the rank and file would endure.
By stage three, crucial union conferences &#8211; those of the AEU, TGWU,
NUM and many others &#8211; decided to oppose any third year of wage
restraint. From the summer of 1977 the government was obliged to
police this phase on its own. However, the union leaders still
tacitly collaborated. Only one union resisted stage three with strike
action &#8211; the Fire Brigades Union which began an eight-week strike
for a 30 per cent pay claim in November 1977. The Labour government
mobilised all its forces against them &#8211; including the use of
troops. Despite wide public support the firemen were defeated.</p>

<p>When the government tried to impose stage four in August 1978 &#8211;
a 5 per cent pay limit, the floodgates broke. The result was the
&#8216;winter of discontent&#8217;. Nevertheless, Wilson and Callaghan could
still pat themselves on the back. They had achieved de facto union
cooperation in incomes policy over a long and tough period, 1975&#8211;78.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Blunting workers&#8217; militancy</h4>

<p class="fst">To carry its policies, the government had above all to blunt the
militancy that the working class had shown in 1968&#8211;74. By using the
trade union bureaucracy it regained by stealth what the Heath
government had lost in open battle.</p>

<p>Already under the Wilson government of 1964&#8211;70 a whole number of
steps had been taken to undermine shop stewards&#8217; organisation. The
final fruits were garnered under the Labour government of 1974&#8211;79.</p>

<p>In 1964, Wilson had appointed the Donovan Commission to look into
union affairs. In 1968 it delivered its report. The main target was
clear: shop-floor organisation. To overcome this, Donovan suggested
productivity deals, which would replace piecework, deprive the shop
stewards of their basic role of negotiating bonus rates, make more
convenors and senior stewards full-time so as to distance them from
the shop floor, and tighten the links between the senior stewards of
the factory and the union bureaucracy. By 1980 69 per cent of
workplaces employing over 1,000 manual workers had full-time
convenors. The speediest growth in the number of full-time senior
stewards was in the years 1975&#8211;77. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p>The pernicious effect of the rhetoric of &#8216;national interest&#8217;
in the mouths of Labour and trade union leaders can be seen if we
look at three core sections of the organised working class which had
shaken the Heath government to its foundations: Govan on the Clyde,
British Leyland and mining.</p>

<p>The advantages of Labour&#8217;s carrot over the Tory stick were shown
graphically with the introduction of the &#8216;workers&#8217; participation&#8217;
which Donovan had argued for. Govan, the new name for three of the
four former UCS yards (the fourth becoming Marathon), had been
pioneers in the field. Stewards sat on a joint union-management
committee monitoring a harsh productivity deal. They signed a
31-point agreement which contained elaborate no-strike pledges and
massive concessions on work practices which gave management the right
to impose compulsory overtime.</p>

<p>When shipyard workers at Swan Hunter on the Tyne refused a tough
management package tied to a large Polish ship order, Govan scabbed
on them. Jimmy Airlie, Govan&#8217;s Communist convenor, had led the UCS
occupation in 1971 and asked at that lime, &#8216;Are the other shipyards
going to accept our orders and let my men starve?&#8217; But in 1978 he
sang a new song. &#8216;If Newcastle are losing six ships through
disputes, we will build them. If not us, then the Japs will.&#8217;</p>

<p>Participation also became the rage in the car industry. It led to
blacklegging becoming respectable at Longbridge, British Leyland&#8217;s
biggest factory, and for decades by far the most militant plant in
the car industry.</p>

<p>In 1975 senior stewards accepted a three-tier system of
participation accompanied by an announcement that 12,000 jobs had to
go. Now, instead of seven full-time senior stewards, Longbridge had
more than fifty. A gap was created between them and the members. The
<strong>Financial Times</strong> gave fulsome praise of the Longbridge senior
stewards. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p>Derek Robinson, the Longbridge convenor, chairman of the British
Leyland combine committee and a leading member of the Communist
Party, was more profuse in his praise of &#8216;participation&#8217; than
anyone else. More and more he spoke as the partner of management: &#8216;<em>we</em>
still haven&#8217;t won the conception amongst the broad masses of people
on the shop floor that <em>they</em>&#8217;ve got a vested interest in
efficiency no less than <em>we</em> have. It is one of <em>our</em>
problems ... if we are able to ... make Leyland successful as a
publicly-owned company, then it is self-evident that that will be a
major political victory.&#8217; <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>

<p>Under Robinson the Longbridge works committee, instead of serving
as a transmission belt for channelling workers&#8217; demands upwards,
came to serve the interests of the employers, transferring their
orders downwards.</p>

<p>Participation weakened shop-floor organisation, increased
sectionalism, and, finally, made scabbing an official tactic. In
February 1977 2,365 toolmakers throughout British Leyland went on a
one-month strike for separate bargaining rights and restoration of
differentials. When the government threatened to sack them, AUEW
president Hugh Scanlon declared that this decision &#8216;has the full
backing of all the unions&#8217;. Robinson agreed and encouraged all
workers to cross the toolroom workers&#8217; picket. In August 1978 the
toolroom in the company&#8217;s SU Carburettor plant came out on strike.
Again both union officials and the leadership of the combine lined up
with management. <a href="#na" name="fa">[1*]</a></p>

<p>The years of participation did terrible damage. The government
appointed a tough new manager at British Leyland, Michael Edwardes,
who proposed 12,500 redundancies in January 1978. Mass meetings were
held in protest, but soon the majority of senior stewards and union
officials decided to accept. In November a strike called by the
Longbridge shop stewards&#8217; committee against the government&#8217;s 5
per cent limit on wage rises petered out without a murmur. On 10
September 1979 Edwardes, with the support of the leadership of the
Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, exploited the
gap between the shop stewards and their members, and initiated a
ballot over the heads of the stewards. This simply asked workers:
&#8216;Are you in favour of the Leyland survival plan?&#8217; without even
pretending to spell out what that meant. The vote was &#8216;yes&#8217; by 7 to 1.</p>

<p>Now Edwardes no longer needed participation. On 19 October he
sacked Robinson. In spite of everything, Longbridge was solid, and
57,000 workers came out on strike in BL as a whole. But the picket
was small, and little effort was made to spread the strike elsewhere.
On 27 October the AUEW called it off, and Robinson himself backed
down, leaving the shop floor terribly demoralised.</p>

<p>In short, the strength of the Longbridge workers&#8217; organisation,
which had played a key role in supporting the miners in 1972, had
atrophied disastrously.</p>

<p>In the case of the miners, the measure used to undermine their
ability to struggle was the incentive scheme, a sort of productivity
deal giving widely differing incomes between coalfields, and even
between individual pits. In September 1974 the National Coal Board
and representatives of the miners&#8217; union executive submitted
details of a draft agreement. In a ballot 61.53 per cent of the NUM
members rejected this.</p>

<p>But the government, represented by energy secretary Tony Benn, and
the Coal Board kept the pressure up. NUM president Joe Gormley
obliged them by breaking the union&#8217;s constitution and balloting
again. He hoped to overrule the previous decision but once more the
majority (55.6 per cent) rejected the scheme. Now the NUM executive
allowed separate areas to negotiate their own local incentive
schemes, which Nottinghamshire and others rapidly proceeded to do.
This, more than anything, created the deep divisions that were to
take such a heavy toll in 1984&#8211;85. The needs of the scabbing in
that strike were sown by the Labour government in 1977.</p>

<p>The Callaghan government went further than just encouraging
scabbing. When the Glasgow dustcart drivers came out on strike in
March 1975, the government sent in troops to break the strike &#8211; and
the army was used again against the firemen in the winter if 1977&#8211;78.</p>

<p>The differing roles of the political and trade union wings of the
labour bureaucracy were underlined by these events. When <strong>In Place
of Strife</strong> had been proposed back in 1969, mass pressure had
forced the TUC to lean on the Labour Party. Now, however, Labour
exploited the Achilles heel of do-it-yourself reformism &#8211; its
openness to generalised reformist politics in the shape of appeals on
behalf of the &#8216;national interest&#8217;. Labour&#8217;s link with the trade
unions now meant that it could <em>use union bureaucracy to police the
working class</em> far more effectively than could Heath&#8217;s
industrial relations courts and all the paraphernalia of the state.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">A Chamber of Horrors: The Labour government&#8217;s economic record</h4>

<p class="fst">Despite its efforts, the five years of the 1974&#8211;79 Labour
government saw the lowest economic growth since the war. The sickness
of capital was beyond the cure of its doctors. Britain&#8217;s industrial
output in 1978 barely recovered to the 1973 level. Between 1953&#8211;66
the average annual real growth was 2.9 per cent. In the years 1967&#8211;73
it was 3.4 per cent; during 1974&#8211;78 it was only 0.9 per cent. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>While in office, the government turned the average 2 per cent
annual wage rises between 1948 and 1973 into a 1.6 per cent average
annual fall. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a> Even after the
breakdown of incomes policy in 1978, real wages were still below
1973. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p>When in the winter of 1971&#8211;72 unemployment had mounted to nearly
a million &#8211; at that time an unprecedented post-war figure, panic
had gripped the Tory government and it quickly resorted to a whole
number of reflationary measures. Under Labour the loyalty of the
trade unions and their members abated the outcry. In January 1975
there were 678,000 people out of work; by December 1975, this figure
had risen to 1,129,000, by December 1976 to 1,273,000, and by
September 1977 to 1,609,000. Despite a moderate fall 1,300,000 people
were still unemployed in December 1978.</p>

<p>The February 1974 Labour manifesto had promised to &#8216;strike at
the roots of the worst poverty.&#8217; Actually the numbers living below
the official poverty line rose from 1,410,000 in 1974 to 2,280,000 in
1976. There were 5,260,000 people with income levels no more than 40
per cent above the Supplementary Benefit poverty line in 1974. Two
years later there were 8,500,000. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p>An economist wrote in <strong>The Observer</strong> of Labour&#8217;s wage restraint:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The past twelve months have almost certainly seen the
sharpest fall in the real living standards of Britain&#8217;s working
population in any year for at least a century, including the wars.
Indeed, to find a comparable fall, it will probably be necessary to
go back to the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">And a <strong>Financial Times </strong>columnist commented:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I cannot for the life of me think of any reason why
anyone should consider voting Conservative at the next general
election ... we are already served by about as good a conservative
government as we are likely to get. For a start Mr Callaghan&#8217;s
government has sat out a level of unemployment that no Conservative
government would have dared to accept. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Reformism is the product of left ideas generated by class struggle
but contained. Upon this soil the labour bureaucracy grows up. But
the crisis forced the bureaucracy to go much further than before. It
moved from <em>containment</em> to actually <em>attacking the very basis
of the movement upon which it rested</em>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, as we shall see in the next chapter, basic workers&#8217;
organisation has proved more resilient than pessimists such as Eric
Hobsbawm believe. Nevertheless, in the five years between 1974 and
1979 Labour turned the greatest advance in workers&#8217; struggle for
fifty years <em>into a retreat</em>. By demoralising the working class
Labour <em>positively assisted</em> an ideological advance of the right.</p>

<p>One example will demonstrate.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The National Front: Ugly child of government policies <small><a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></small></h4>

<p class="fst">Mass unemployment, government spending cuts, a decline in i real
wages and increasing general social deprivation in the years 1975&#8211;78
created conditions for the neo-fascist National Front to nourish.
Spring 1976 saw a set of unfortunate Asians kicked out of Malawi, a
tragic legacy of British imperialism in Africa. Media hysteria
mounted, with the <strong>Sun</strong> screaming: &#8216;Scandal of &#163;600 a week
immigrants&#8217; (the money went to a racketeering hotelier), the <strong>Daily
Mirror</strong>: &#8216;New Flood of Asians to Britain&#8217;, and the <strong>Daily
Telegraph</strong>: &#8216;Invasion of Asians Forces Borough to Call for
Help&#8217;. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p>The National Front made substantial electoral gains in 1976. In
local elections at Blackburn the National Front and National Party
together got an average of 38 per cent of the vote; in Leicester the
NF got 18.5 per cent. In Deptford (Lewisham), in a council
by-election in July 1976 the two parties together won 44 per cent
(possibly over half the white vote) &#8211; more than the winning Labour
candidate, who got 43 per cent. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p>Instead of campaigning against racism, the Labour Party leadership
at the time was pandering to it. On 18 May 1976 Bob Mellish, Labour&#8217;s
chief whip and MP for Bermondsey, spoke on the &#8216;influx&#8217; of Malawi
Asians: &#8216;This nation has done all it should have done. Its record
is one of great honour and integrity, but I say &#8220;enough is
enough&#8221;.&#8217; It was perfectly natural that the very next speaker
should be Enoch Powell, who whipped up further hysteria round
Mellish&#8217;s catchphrase: &#8216;Measures were needed: the first was that
they should terminate net immigration and say &#8220;Enough is enough&#8221;.&#8217;
<a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a> The chorus was then taken up by
the press and racists far and wide. With Labour spouting racism the
cockroaches began emerging from under the stones. They had plenty to
feed on.</p>

<p>1977 saw a massive deterioration in working people&#8217;s living
standards. It is no wonder that the year saw even greater electoral
successes for the NF. In the May elections for the Greater London
Council (GLC) they stood candidates in 85 out of the 92
constituencies, getting 119,063 votes or 5 per cent of the poll, and
beating the Liberals into third place in 33 constituencies. In 1973
they had received only 0.5 per cent.</p>

<p>The Labour Party was paralysed before the fascist menace which by
its nature stood outside the rules of the parliamentary game. By
contrast, the Socialist Workers Party organised repeated
demonstrations against the National Front. The most important was in
Lewisham on 13 August 1977, when 5,000 anti-fascists broke through
police lines twice and dispersed an NF march. The police then
violently attacked the anti-fascists in a battle that raged for hours.</p>

<p>Afterwards, just as had happened in the 1930s, the Labour Party
and press treated the fascists and anti-fascists to exactly equal abuse.</p>

<p>Michael Foot, then deputy prime minister, said: &#8216;The most
ineffective way of fighting the Fascists is to behave like them.&#8217;
<a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a> Ron Hayward, general secretary of
the Labour Party, &#8216;saw little difference between the violent
demonstrators [by whom he meant the Socialist Workers Party members]
and &#8220;NF Fascists&#8221; <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> The Labour
Party West Midland organiser went on in the same vein about the
Socialist Workers Party: &#8216;They are just red Fascists. They besmirch
the good name of democratic socialism.&#8217; <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p>At the 1977 Labour Party Conference Sid Bidwell MP described the
anti-fascists as &#8216;hooligans ... who have yet to take their part in
responsibility in the real Labour movement&#8217;. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a>
At the same conference, the delegate from Lewisham East Constituency
Labour Party declared: &#8216;Certainly the answer is not in violent
confrontation with the National Front. Who won on 13 August in
Lewisham? Only the National Front.&#8217; <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a></p>

<p>On the contrary. The battle of Lewisham was a springboard for
launching the immensely popular Anti Nazi League (ANL) in November
1977, in which the Socialist Workers Party played an important role.</p>

<p>Mainly to give a focus for youth against the National Front &#8211;
the age group where they drew most of their support &#8211; the ANL
organised its first Carnival in London at the end of April 1978. Its
success was beyond everyone&#8217;s expectations, bringing 100,000 on a
march from Trafalgar Square to a music festival six miles away.</p>

<p>Rock Against Racism (RAR) then grew up alongside the ANL. Huge
Carnivals took place in Manchester (35,000), Cardiff (5,000),
Edinburgh (8,000), Harwich (2,000), Southampton (5,000), Bradford
(2,000) and London again (80,000). In the ensuing weeks and months
there was a rash of ANL groups springing up all over the country. <a href="#nb" name="fb">[2*]</a></p>

<p>The NF vote in subsequent elections collapsed. In Leeds it
declined by 54 per cent, in Bradford by 77 per cent, even in its East
End heartland it dropped by 40 per cent. The ANL did this by taking a
hard-hitting campaign on to the streets, into the factories and
council estates, and undid some of the political damage wrought by
government policies.</p>

<p>Despite all the taunts about &#8216;red fascists&#8217; and that the ANL
was outside the labour movement, it was in fact rooted there. As
early as mid-April 1978, before the Carnival, it was sponsored by
thirty AUEW branches and districts, twenty-five trades councils,
eleven NUM areas and lodges, more than five branches from each of the
unions TGWU, CPSA, TASS, NUJ, NUT and NUPE, and thirteen shop
stewards&#8217; committees in major factories. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a></p>

<p>The Labour leadership played no role in the ANL. However the ANL
did not ignore the value of winning the support of individual MPs
where this was possible. Thus Neil Kinnock, Audrey Wise and Martin
Flannery were asked to sponsor and did so. They were joined by fifty
local Labour Parties.</p>

<p>In a small way, the SWP was applying the Comintern tactic of the
united front. In fighting the NF the SWP did not fall into t he
ultra-left trap of writing off reformist organisations. As a
revolutionary body its starting point was absolute political and
organisational independence from the reformist Labour Party.
Membership or commitment to the latter would have strangled the ANL
at birth with the cord of electoralism. But this was not enough. As
Trotsky put it in relation to revolutionaries in the 1920s:</p>

<p class="quoteb">If the Communist Party did not seek for organizational
avenues [to] coordinated action between Communist and non-Communist
(including Social-Democratic) working masses ... it would have
thereby laid bare its own incapacity to win over &#8211; on the basis of
mass action &#8211; the majority of the working class. It would
degenerate into a Communist propaganda society but never develop into
a party for the conquest of power. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Obviously fighting the NF was a long way from conquering power,
and calling on certain Labour MPs to make a stand would not change
the world. Nevertheless it bore out the truth of Trotsky&#8217;s
assertion that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The reformists dread the revolutionary potential of the
mass movement; their beloved arena is the parliamentary tribune, the
trade-union bureaus, the arbitration boards, the ministerial ante-chambers.</p>

<p class="quote">[But] we are, apart from all other considerations,
interested in dragging the reformists from their asylums and placing
them alongside ourselves before the eyes of the struggling masses. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The ANL was one bright spark in a gloomy period. Alas there were
precious few others.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The Labour government and the bomb</h4>

<p class="fst">In the case of unilateral disarmament the Labour government did
not &#8216;fight, fight and fight again&#8217; as Gaitskell had done to win
the party conference away from its unilateralism. It simply ignored it.</p>

<p>The 1972 Labour Party conference had carried a unilateralist
motion demanding &#8216;the removal of all nuclear bases in this
country.&#8217; <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a> The resolution was
passed on a show of hands with support from the party executive. The
executive&#8217;s spokesman was right-winger Joe Gormley!</p>

<p>The 1973 conference had gone further, insisting that the
unilateralist pledge &#8216;be included in the general election manifesto
...&#8217; This time, perhaps with a view to the approaching election,
the executive had opposed the motion. Nevertheless it was carried on
a card vote by 3,166,000 to 2,462,000. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p>But on coming to office, Wilson, and later Callaghan, went behind
the back of the Commons and spent &#163;1,000 million on the Polaris
submarine nuclear missile improvement programme, code-named
Chevaline. The Labour Government also entered into an agreement with
NATO to increase defence spending by 3 per cent in real terms for the
six years from 1979.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Labour and Northern Ireland</h4>

<p class="fst">As Britain&#8217;s oldest imperialist possession, the question of
Northern Ireland has been an important touchstone for socialists.
Labour&#8217;s commitment to the British state has meant that since the
Attlee government, the three tenets, of Labour policy on Ireland had
been: support for partition; bipartisanship at Westminster &#8211; in
other words the mutual support by Labour and the Tories of each
other&#8217;s policies towards Northern Ireland whichever is in
government; and the upholding of the right of the Unionists in
Northern Ireland to veto any constitutional change. It was Attlee,
who in May 1949 enacted the Ireland Act, which stated &#8216;that in no
event will Northern Ireland or any part thereof cease to be part of
His Majesty&#8217;s Dominions and of the United Kingdom without the
consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.&#8217; <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p>Wilson was the prime minister who, in August 1969, had sent the
troops into Northern Ireland, whence they have not yet withdrawn.
When the internment of Republicans without trial had been introduced
by Stormont, the Northern Ireland parliament, in August 1971, an
emergency debate took place in the House of Commons. By now the
Tories were back in office, and Labour officially abstained, although
numbers of Labour MPs voted against the government.</p>

<p>On 30 January 1972 in Derry, the British army shot and killed 13
anti-internment demonstrators in what became known as 'Bloody
Sunday&#8217;. When Lord Widgery, the high court judge, whitewashed the
army&#8217;s action, Jim Callaghan, for the Labour opposition, declared:
&#8216;The Prime Minister asks for the combined support of the House. He
has it.&#8217; <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p>In 1974 it was the Labour government which rushed through the
Prevention of Terrorism Act, allowing arrest without charge, as well
as deportation and exclusion of suspects from Britain without trial.</p>

<p>In 1976 the political &#8216;special category status&#8217; for Republican
prisoners, which had been won from the Tory administration in 1972,
was taken away by Merlyn Rees, Labour&#8217;s Northern Ireland secretary.
Republican hunger strikes followed in the H-blocks of Long Kesh. This
culminated with the death in prison of Bobby Sands in 1981. When news
of his death reached the Commons:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There were loud cheers from all parts of the Commons
yesterday as Mr Michael Foot, leader of the Labour Party, placed
himself squarely behind Mrs Margaret Thatcher in her firm rejection
of the demands of the IRA hunger strikers&#8217;. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Nine other hunger strikers died without any change of position by Labour.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Labour leadership was not even ashamed to
forge a parliamentary alliance with the Official Unionists in July
1977. Its pact with the Liberals had ended and Labour no longer had
an overall Commons majority. In payment for the Orange vote, six
extra parliamentary seats were given to Northern Ireland.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Deep divisions between government and party</h4>

<p class="fst">Relations between the Labour government and the rest of the party
had been strained between 1966 and 1970. Likewise under the Labour
government of 1974&#8211;79, but on a much grander scale. During these
years Labour Party Conference was to overrule the executive no less
than twenty-three times. <a href="#nc" name="fc">[3*]</a></p>

<p>The executive&#8217;s policy recommendations were often critical of
the government. Geoff Bish, secretary of the Labour Party Research
Department, reviewing relations between the executive and the
government, described the vast input of the executive into Labour&#8217;s
policy process:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Over the past five years, working through a network of
subcommittees and study groups, the Home Policy Committee has been
responsible for the publication of no less than 70 major NEC
statements of one kind or another, including statements to
Conference, the 60,000 word <strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme 1976</strong>,
evidence to Royal Commissions and direct submissions to the Labour
Govern&shy;ment itself. Over 2,000 research papers have been
prepared, either within the Research Department or by outside
experts. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The result? <em>Nil</em>. The government paid scant attention to
resolutions from the executive or conference. By a majority of two to
one the Labour Party Special Conference in April 1975 strongly
endorsed a &#8216;No&#8217; vote in the referendum to be held on whether
Britain should remain a member of the Common Market. No matter. Prime
minister Jim Callaghan went his own way, joining Tories and Liberals
in campaigning for Britain to stay in.</p>

<p>The 1977 conference decided by 6,248,000 votes to 91,000 to
include abolition of the House of Lords in Labour&#8217;s election
manifesto. Constitutionally any conference resolution that received
two-thirds of the vote had to be included in the manifesto. But
Callaghan didn&#8217;t give a damn: abolition of the Lords did not go
into the manifesto.</p>

<p>The same conference deplored &#8216;the continuing disqualification
from public office of the twenty-one Clay Cross Labour Party members
<a href="#nd" name="fd">[4*]</a> and demands that the Government
introduce a Bill to remove the disqualifications forthwith. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a>
This resolution had no more impact on the government than water off a
duck&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>In 1978 the Labour Party conference rejected the government&#8217;s 5
per cent pay rise guideline by 4,077,000 votes to 194,000 &#8211; to no
avail. The sort of methods used were described by Wilson&#8217;s press
secretary: &#8216;His tactic for dealing with the NEC was simply not to
turn up at its meetings, and ignoring any decisions it took with
which he disagreed.&#8217; <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a></p>

<p>Innumerable times Labour Party conferences went against government
policy. While the Attlee government suffered only a few defeats, and
on largely marginal issues, in 1974-79 defeat was common.</p>
<p>An unprecedented number of rebellions also took place in the
parliamentary party against the government, and this at a time when
the government had little or no majority. Although the rebellions
could do little to change the course of events, the betrayals had at
last become too disgusting for even the most cast-iron reformist
constitution to stomach. As P Norton writes: &#8216;the Parliamentary
Labour Party witnessed the most serious division lobby dissent of us
post-war history, indeed of its whole history.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Under the Attlee government, in only one case did fifty or more
Labour MPs vote against the government; in 1964&#8211;66 there were no
such votes and in 1966&#8211;70 it happened six times; but in 1974-79 it
happened <em>forty-five times</em>. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a>
The situation deteriorated as each year passed. In the 1974&#8211;75
parliamentary session, Labour MPs dissented in 14.5 per cent of all
divisions. This rose steadily to reach 45 per cent in 1978. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a>
The average number of Labour MPs voting against the 1974&#8211;79
government was three times that of 1964&#8211;70 and four times the level
under Attlee. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a> Norton concludes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">there were more divisions witnessing dissenting votes in
the one Parliament returned in October 1974 than there were in the
whole of the period, covering seven Parliaments, from 1945 to 1970. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Labour dissidents were largely organised in the Tribune Group.
This met once and sometimes twice a week, principally to debate
current parliamentary business. In Neil Kinnock&#8217;s words:</p>

<p class="quoteb">ideals must, like any other motive force, be organized if
they are to be effective and the Tribune Group&#8217;s most frequent and
telling activity is to give an organized lead to opinion in the PLP.
<a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Kinnock consistently opposed the 1974&#8211;79 government&#8217;s
right-wing policies, voting 84 times in dissent. The total
ineffectiveness of this activity can be measured by the government&#8217;s
appalling record in all spheres.</p>

<p>The impression may be gathered that even if the PLP, the party
executive or conference could not control events, at least the
cabinet, perhaps, had some influence. Nothing could be further from
the truth. One need only read the cabinet diaries of Richard Crossman
and Barbara Castle to see that the prime minister and the chancellor
of the exchequer, who hold the key posts in any government, paid
little heed to the rest.</p>

<p>Joe Haines, Wilson&#8217;s press secretary, was amazed by what he
learnt of the way government actually functions:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I find it astonishing that a Labour Cabinet can still
tolerate a situation where the Chancellor of the Exchequer only
acquaints them with the content of his Budget some twenty-eight hours
before he presents it to Parliament. <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This could lead to the sort of farcical situation that occurred
with the budget of 6 April 1976. The previous day Callaghan had been
chosen as the new prime minister. He had no clue as to the budget&#8217;s
contents! Even more pathetic is this story from the same year:</p>

<p class="quoteb">When the announcement about further cuts in public
expenditure were [<em>sic</em>] made on Thursday, July 22, the Cabinet
were only told on the previous day ... The Secretary of State for
Employment, Albert Booth, was forced to do his own calculations, on
the back of an envelope while the Cabinet meeting progressed, about
its likely effect upon jobs. <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The apparent freedom of the chancellor is illusory. The very
secrecy of the budget disguises the real influence of outside forces.
This secrecy is, in Haines&#8217; words:</p>

<p class="quoteb">not only absurd and anti-democratic, it is a powerful
buttress to the supremacy of the Treasury mind over that of the
elected Government&#8217;s. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Treasury for its part reflects the power of capital: business,
finance, industry, foreign exchange and commodity markets,
economists, monetarists, shareholders, stockbrokers, the City of
London and the Governor of the Bank of England, not to mention the
speculative pressure of the financiers, whose ability to engineer a
sterling crisis always puts Labour government on the defensive. From
the inside Haines witnessed what outsiders had suspected all along,
that top civil servants were willing to sabotage or cripple a
government that did not comply in every detail with the needs of
capital as they understood it.</p>

<p class="quoteb">At times the determination of the Treasury to compel the
Government of the day to accept the policies in which it honestly
believes is ruthless, even to the point where it seeks to create the
conditions which make it impossible for the Government to spurn its
advice ...</p>

<p class="quote">The fall in the sterling exchange rate to below two
dollars, which occurred in March 1976, was welcomed by the Treasury
and the Bank of England though it came to the surprise and dismay of
the politicians. The cuts in public expenditure of over &#163;1,000
million ... following upon cuts of more than &#163;3,000 million which
had been decided upon only five months earlier, were a direct
consequence ... The pattern then, you can be certain, was exactly the
same as it was on countless previous occasions. <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Imagine for a moment that the impossible happened &#8211; that MPs
really controlled the cabinet which in turn controlled the chancellor
of the exchequer and the prime minister. This still would not mean
that the House of Commons had the power to initiate real changes in
the economy and society. Much larger forces than the House of Commons
face any government. The fate of every Labour government has shown
that any reform which the establishment disliked came up against the
undemocratic House of Lords and the monarchy, as well as the top
layers of the Civil Service. Behind these are the forces of the
police, army and judiciary, the &#8216;bodies of armed men&#8217; which
guarantee the power of the state whichever government is nominally in office.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The contortions of Tony Benn</h4>

<p class="fst">The position of Tony Benn under the Wilson/Callaghan
administration was awkward. He wanted to be the star of the left on
the executive and at party conferences, while retaining membership of
the most right-wing cabinet Labour has ever had. Even his talents as
a political acrobat could not stave off an occasional fall from the
tightrope. A couple of cases will illustrate this.</p>

<p>On 30 October 1974 the party executive censured the government for
the Royal Navy&#8217;s joint exercises with the South African navy at
Simonstown, which were &#8216;directly contrary both to party policy and
to clear assurances given by the government itself.&#8217; <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a>
Benn was one of three ministers on the executive who voted for the
censure. Wilson wrote to each saying they had broken collective
cabinet responsibility and demanded a promise it would not happen
again. If this was not forthcoming, he would interpret this as
resignation from the cabinet. <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a>
Barbara Castle tells the rest of the story:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The three Ministers concerned in the row had got together
to draft a letter which Harold had not found satisfactory. Then,
before they could meet again, Wedgie [Benn] had written to Harold
again off his own bat, capitulating and leaving the other two high
and dry. Joan Lestor was furious with him. &#8216;He&#8217;s a very odd
chap&#8217;, said Mike [Foot] in his typically tolerant way. <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Wilson commented with glee: &#8216;I insisted on the exact words of my
demand, which in each of the three cases was finally met.&#8217; <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a></p>

<p>Benn&#8217;s behaviour was no more heroic when it came to the 1976
government spending cuts. Donoghue records a phone conversation in
the prime minister&#8217;s study. Benn rang to say he was under pressure
from his constituency activists in Bristol over the cuts. The prime
minister replied:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Tony, why don&#8217;t you make up your own mind? And if
you do stay in the Cabinet but continued campaigning against a
collective Cabinet decision, you will be sacked immediately.&#8217; I do
not know what the small elite group of Bristol activists advised, but
Tony Benn remained, and relatively quietly. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Benn was the energy minister who, while speaking left in support
of the miners, did not baulk at imposing the incentive scheme-even
though it was repeatedly rejected in miners&#8217; ballots. Moreover,
between October 1976 and March 1977, in the biggest ever closure
programme, Benn totally or partially shut forty-eight power stations,
thirty-nine of which were coal-fired. This contrasted with his eager
support for the nuclear industry. In his former role minister of
technology he encouraged the processing and processing of nuclear
fuels and later went as far as arming the police at the Windscale
nuclear reprocessing plant. <a name="f62" href="#n62">[62]</a> He also shut his eyes to the fact that Windscale ran on uranium fromSouth African-ruled Namibia &#8211; despite Labour&#8217;s officialopposition to mule with South Africa and the United Nations ban onthe importing of Namibian uranium.</p>

<p>Throughout the years 1974&#8211;79 Benn was torn between his executiveand government roles, but let the second dominate. He had been amember of every Labour government since 1964 despite theiranti-working class actions.</p>

<p>Benn&#8217;s equivocation followed not only from his position asleader of the left on the executive and also a &#8216;responsible&#8217;minister, but also from the moderate political stance he took in the1950s mid 1960s. Only during the Heath government did he movepolitically to the left. Thus he had not been a member of the TribuneGroup, the Keep Left Group or the Victory for Socialism Group, he wasnot a Bevanite nor a supporter of CND.</p>

<p>At the 1959 Labour conference, Benn followed Gaitskell&#8217;s muck onClause Four and, mounting the platform, declared: &#8216;You cannotattract and keep the loyalty of younger people, if the majority ofthe movement are still thinking too much about the past as they seemto be.&#8217; <a name="f63" href="#n63">[63]</a></p>

<p>When Frank Cousins resigned from Wilson&#8217;s cabinet in 1966 as
minister of technology in protest at incomes policy, it was Benn who
took over his office.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The denouement</h4>

<p class="fst">The Callaghan government collapsed under the massive pressure of
industrial discontent in the winter of 1978&#8211;79. In September 1978
the TUC opposed the 5 per cent pay norm; in October the Labour Party
rejected it by 4,017,000 votes to 1,924,000. Strikes swept through
Fords, the bakeries and provincial journalism. In January it was the
turn of railwaymen followed by a two week strikes of petrol tanker
and road haulage drivers. The transport and public sectors were drawn
into a vast range of disputes.</p>

<p>Disruption was compounded by widespread secondary picketing and an
extremely severe winter exacerbated by a local authority dispute
which meant roads were not gritted. On 22 January 1,250,000 local
authority workers engaged in a one-day national strike, followed by
widespread disruption. The tanker drivers settled for a 15 per cent
pay rise and the haulage drivers for between 15 and 20 per cent; the
local authority workers accepted 9 per cent. <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a></p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s pay policies had once more broken down under pressure
from below. Labour had failed to fulfil its promises to those who had
elected it. <em>But for the ruling class it had achieved a great deal.</em></p>

<p>Unlike 1969, the &#8216;winter of discontent&#8217; of 1979 was not part
of a rising tide of struggle or class consciousness, but a receding
one. The Labour Party had broken the tendency which had been growing
under the Heath government, when workers were beginning to challenge
capitalist society in action. Though this had been insufficient in
1974 to pose an alternative to electoral politics, it had been a
developing force. The high level of strikes in 1979, however, did not
break out of the cycle of sectionalism and scabbing which Labour had
helped make respectable. The element of growing political
generalisation had been lost.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s success in holding back the workers&#8217; movement
provided the background to the general election of May 1979, which
the party lost badly.</p>

During the March 1977 strike for higher pay by 535 electricians,
members of the EETPU in BSC&#8217;s Port Talbot steel plant, the other
6,500 trade unionists in the plant, members of the AUEW, TGWU and
other unions, were instructed by their leadership to cross the picket
line. This strike went on for more than two months. The second
example is the strike of 5,000 maintenance engineers at London&#8217;s
Heathrow Airport (1 April to 27 April 1977) when 54,000 other trade
unionists, members of the TGWU, GMWU, EETPU, among others, were
instructed to cross the picket line.</p>

seven more, on things such as cars for the disabled, housing, the
NHS, child benefit and public spending. There were three defeats in
1977 on housing, Zimbabwe and the disqualified Clay Cross
councillors. 1978&#8217;s four defeats were on the NHS, incomes policy,
economic strategy and education. 1979 saw the executive overruled on
the election of the party leader. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fd" name="nd">4*.</a> The Clay Cross councillors had
carried out Labour's policy of refusing to implement the Tory

council house rents, and had been surcharged and debarred from
holding public office.</p>
