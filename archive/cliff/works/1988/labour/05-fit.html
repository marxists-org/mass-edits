<h3>The Labour Party</h3>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h1>5. Proving Labour &#8216;Fit to Govern&#8217;:<br/>
The 1924 Administration</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">ALTHOUGH the first Labour Government lasted just nine months, it
showed the important qualitative change the Party undergoes when in
Government. MacDonald&#8217;s tenancy of 10 Downing Street was in one way
just the completion of 30 years&#8217; political work. Yet in another
sense it was a sharp break with the past. Labour&#8217;s mediation
between class and nation had to alter dramatically.</p>

<p>Reformist politicians deny the fundamental contradiction between
working class interests and capitalism, and <em>most of the time rank
and file workers and the trade union bureaucracy share this belief</em>.
Labourism seems to be sound common sense. But as Engels puts it:
&#8216;sound common sense, respectable fellow that he is in the homely
realm of his own four walls, has very wonderful adventures directly
he ventures out.&#8217; <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> Workers&#8217; false
consciousness can be shaken by contact with the reality of a Labour
government if <em>they are forced to generalise through struggle</em>
and move towards clear class politics. Professional reformists
respond differently. <em>Their attitude is shaped not by working class
concerns but the national framework in which they operate.</em></p>
<p>Labour government was a necessary experience for the workers&#8217;
movement. It broke the centuries-long ruling class monopoly. Never
before could it be said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">An engine-driver rose to the rank of Colonial Secretary,
a starveling clerk became Great Britain&#8217;s Premier, a foundry-hand
was changed to Foreign Secretary, the son of a Keighley weaver was
created Chancellor of the Exchequer, one miner became Secretary for
War and another Secretary of State for Scotland. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Only a Labour government could show whether this made any
difference. It <em>was a practical step towards demonstrating the
bankruptcy of reformism.</em> Government office was necessary to put
Labour&#8217;s rhetoric to the test.</p>

<p>In 1924 Labour had a dual task. Firstly, even though it did not
fully control the state (thus in October civil servants and secret
servicemen helped bring the Tories back), Labour was <em>responsible</em>
for it. Secondly, its position in &#8216;the executive committee of the
ruling class&#8217;, made Labour the guardian of British capitalism as a
whole. We shall deal with each aspect in turn.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Who captures whom?</h4>

<p class="fst">Labour&#8217;s supporters thought the new cabinet symbolised a
working-class capture of the state. The truth was the other way round.</p>

<p>Take the role of the top civil servant. Thomas declared: &#8216;the
country ought to feel everlastingly indebted. His brain capacity is
first class. No one can challenge his absolute integrity and desire
to serve.&#8217; <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> With touching naivete
Clynes, the deputy party leader, &#8216;found the permanent officials
extraordinarily helpful and kind&#8217;. He saw nothing sinister in the
fact that: &#8216;They were always beside me, advising, coaching and
checking; and in a short time I gained a measure of knowledge
necessary in matters where, perhaps, national safety or the spending
of millions of money was concerned.&#8217; <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>The remarkable influence of the senior civil servant was
illustrated by Thomas Jones of the Cabinet Secretariat. His diaries
are a chronicle of manipulation. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
Jones was &#8216;a passionate Free-Trader, an intimate and trusted friend
of Lloyd George [who] voted Liberal&#8217;. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a>
He himself describes how on 9 October 1924 the King&#8217;s Speech, the
final word of the Labour government, was put together:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Sidney Webb suddenly entered my room and announced that ... he
wanted a draft of the King&#8217;s Speech in twenty minutes ... He began
writing at once a paragraph on unemployment while I rang up Sir Eyre
Crowe [and other Civil Servants] ... Sir Otto Niemeyer from the
Treasury and Sir John Shuckburgh ... Sir Claude Schuster blew in to
say that he would like a reference made to the immediacy of the
dissolution ... Hankey took, p.&nbsp;by, p.&nbsp;to the PM, for final
approval. I think he saw about half the speech in this way. He made
no change of any kind and left the rest to us to finish off as we
like. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A few weeks later Jones was giving Baldwin tips on
who to include in the newly-elected Tory cabinet and writing anti-
Bolshevik speeches for him.</p>

<p>MacDonald well understood the power of the
unelected official over the minister. He categorically rejected a
Labour Party suggestion that the government appoint its own advisors:
&#8216;a Civil Service told quite frankly that we have no confidence in
it would never work at all.&#8217; <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> <a href="#na" name="fa">[1*]</a></p>

<p>The army was also a sacrosanct institution. Stephen Walsh at the
War Office &#8216;was entirely unable to conceal his reverence for
generals&#8217;, saying &#8216;I know my place. You have commanded Armies in
the Field when I was nothing but a private in the ranks.&#8217; <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>
MacDonald himself dared not place &#8216;a mere commoner and a Socialist&#8217;
in control of &#8216;the King&#8217;s Navy&#8217; and put a diehard Tory there
instead. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> The intelligence services
made clear their contempt for elected persons when they refused to
let the premier see his own secret file. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a>
Nine months later they helped the Tories return by concocting a
famous forgery &#8211; &#8216;Zinoviev&#8217;s red letter&#8217; &#8211; with
Conservative Central Office and White Russian <em>emigres.</em></p>

<p>With the army came imperialism. Thomas&#8217;s first words at the
Colonial Office were &#8216;I&#8217;m here to see that there is no mucking
about with the British Empire.&#8217; <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p>Finally we come to the pinnacle of this great establishment heap &#8211;
the throne. The way in which most Labour ministers literally fell
over themselves to conform to pomp and ceremony would have been
laughable had it not been so nauseating. <a href="#nb" name="fb">[2*]</a>
When Labour took office George V wrote in his diary: &#8216;23 years ago
dear Grand mama died. I wonder what she would have thought of a
Labour Government!&#8217; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> He was
calmed at his first interview with MacDonald who emphasised &#8216;his
earnest desire was to serve his King and Country&#8217;. MacDonald
assured the king that he would try to break Labour&#8217;s irritating
habit of singing <em>The Red Flag</em> and pointed out that he had
already used &#8216;all his influence and that of his moderate and
immediate friends&#8217; to prevent this song being sung in the Commons! <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p>Sublime majesty inevitably exuded from the rest of the royal
brood. Of the queen, Thomas exclaimed &#8216;with what dignity and charm
she will fulfil her great task ... the people took to her instantly
and instinctively. The presence, the personality &#8211; and the smile,
which in itself radiates confidence and affection &#8211; are all there
and will assuredly be used for the benefit of her people.&#8217; <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a>
It took an outsider like Wertheimer to appreciate how utterly
ludicrous was this &#8216;rather Gilbertian vista of a preponderantly
Socialist society with a feudal first chamber [consisting of a]
hereditary nobility&#8217;. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p>The fact that the state had swallowed the Labour government whole
showed itself in innumerable ways. We shall give just two examples,
one small, one great. Arthur Henderson, the former lay preacher,
found as Home Secretary that, against his beliefs, he was expected to
hang criminals. His biographer records that he &#8216;took the line that
his immediate duty was to administer the law ... and fortunately for
him, the murderers he had to hang were such as not to deserve too
much public sympathy&#8217;. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> <a href="#nc" name="fc">[3*]</a></p>

<p>Of more political importance was the selection of the cabinet.
Labour&#8217;s internal procedure is no model of proletarian democracy,
but at least the indirect methods of block voting and conferences
allow a bare minimum of rank and file self-expression. However,
following precedent, MacDonald took himself off to his solitary
retreat of Lossiemouth and like Moses with the tablets, emerged a
fortnight later brandishing the Cabinet list. What an extraordinary
document! With the exception of John Wheatley at Health <em>the entire
Labour left was excluded.</em> But there were <em>two Tories, an
ex-Tory and four ex-Liberals.</em> Two other Conservatives had been
invited to the cabinet. <a href="#nd" name="fd">[4*]</a></p>

<p>In answer to our question &#8211; &#8216;who captured whom?&#8217; &#8211; the
answer was quite clear. The state had captured the Labour Party. A
new relationship between the Labour Party, the ruling class and the
workers was about to emerge.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Managing the system</h4>

<p class="fst">Until 1924 Labour&#8217;s attitude to many questions could afford to
be vague. That changed with the advent of government and
responsibility for the economy. As Margaret Bondfield (later to
become the first woman cabinet minister in the 1929-31 Labour
government) explained: &#8216;We have taken over a bankrupt machine, and
we have got to make that rickety machine work. There are some of us
who will lose our reputations before this is done.&#8217; <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a>
How right she was!</p>

<p>The first months of the year saw a spate of strikes principally in
transport. Workers wanted to use a partial economic recovery and the
government they themselves elected, to advance their position. But
the <em>first ever meeting of a Labour Cabinet</em> &#8216;without
hesitation and without a dissentient voice&#8217; <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a>
<em>set in motion the blacklegs&#8217; charter</em> &#8211; the Emergency
Powers Act (EPA). <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a> Thomas and
Gosling, leaders of the rail and transport unions took the top posts
in the government&#8217;s scabbing body, the Supply and Transport
Organisation. They met their own union officials and &#8216;made it
perfectly clear that the government was under the obligation to
secure the food for the people&#8217; and waved a &#8216;Proclamation of
Emergency [which] the Government will not hesitate to use&#8217;. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p>In March the cabinet decided that if the tram and bus strike meant
&#8216;the protection which the government could offer could not be
supplied by the ordinary Police service ... it would be necessary to
employ Special Constables&#8217;. Furthermore it was &#8216;actually arranged
with Lord Chelmsford to bring up 800 naval ratings to keep the power
stations going (as it was afterwards discovered, going even beyond
the law in giving him a Cabinet order).&#8217; <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p>Henderson contributed a new design for the old scab recruitment
poster. The only changes were two additions, proudly pro-claiming
that &#8216;the Government&#8217; had issued the poster and that therefore
there was &#8216;No Blacklegging Involved&#8217;. According to Henderson&#8217;s
new English dictionary, under Labour strike-breaking was no longer
the same as blacklegging. Moreover the government should be
complimented for such activities:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In the past the methods of dealing with an emergency and
even the fact that the Government was prepared to take any steps at
all, were shrouded in a certain atmosphere of secrecy. That was due
to the supposition that a considerable party in the state might be in
opposition to the action of the Government ... it is obviously
incorrect with a Labour Government in office. There is nothing to be
ashamed of ... <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But it was a notable fact that the Labour <em>never had to use its
elaborate strike-breaking provisions</em>. It had a more effective
method of blocking militancy &#8211; <em>the good offices of the union
bureaucracy</em>, which imposed settlements arranged by the
government. In the first six months no less than 80 cases were
referred to Industrial Courts while there were five full government
commissions to resolve the biggest disputes. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a>
To the chagrin of the opposition, Bondfield gloated: &#8216;This
Government, at any rate has an advantage which many Members on the
opposite benches do not share. [It is] in an exceptionally favourable
position to deal with industrial disputes.&#8217; <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p>Labour was acting <em>as manager of capitalism</em> and became
increasingly public about it. Some workers could not believe the
transformation. During a dock strike, for example, workers in
Gloucester called on the prime minister &#8216;to use at once emergency
powers to take full control of all shipping and docks <em>to pay the
increases asked for&#8217;</em>. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> They
would not make the same mistake twice.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s new role was a nasty surprise for the union
bureaucracy. Loyalty meant they felt compelled to do the government&#8217;s
dirty work, but the fact remained &#8211; the party they had created now
openly threatened them. A sign of how keen Labour was to prove its
independence from the unions was that it ended the established
practice of showing the TUC proposed labour legislation before it
reached the Commons. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a> Tom Shaw said
&#8216;Parliament is the body to which the Government must submit its
proposals ... it would be wrong to take the line that any other right
to ask consultation&#8217;. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a></p>

<p>The union bureaucracy were angry. Bevin confessed: &#8216;I only wish
it had been a Tory Government in office. We would not have been
frightened by <em>their</em> threats.&#8217; <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a>
Bromley of the engine drivers&#8217; union felt that: &#8216;If the success
of the Labour Party and of a Labour Government can only be built on
such serious losses in wages and conditions by the workers, then I am
not sure the workers will very much welcome a Labour Government.&#8217;
<a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> Union officials did not like
having to act as government agents in settling strikes because this
eroded their authority among the rank and file. Yet grumble as they
might, <em>it was the union bureaucracy that bailed the Labour
Government out.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The true capitalist party?</h4>

<p class="fst">In August 1924, Leo Chiozza Money, one of Labour&#8217;s
representatives on the Sankey Commission, published an article in the
ILP&#8217;s <strong>Forward</strong>, entitled <em>Labour, the True Capitalism</em>.
It argued:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Labour at least should make it clear that it is, in the
true sense of the word, a Capitalist Party &#8211; a Party, that is, that
intends to wield capital on the large scale to national advantage.
<a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The government came perilously close to proving his point. The
prime minister told the opening session of the new parliament:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We shall concentrate not first of all on the relief of
unemployment, but on the restoration of trade ... the Government has
no intention of drawing off from the normal channels of trade large
sums for extemporised measures which can only be palliatives. That is
the old, sound Socialist doctrine [!] and the necessity of
expenditure ... will be judged <em>in relation to the greater
necessity for maintaining undisturbed the ordinary financial
facilities</em> (cheers from Conservative benches). <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When class and nation (in the form of British capital) were put in
the balance, nation proved &#8216;the greater necessity&#8217;.</p>

<p>MacDonald&#8217;s espousal of an openly capitalist philosophy was only
surpassed by Philip Snowden at the Exchequer. In opposition he had
seen heavy direct taxation as a means of redistributing wealth to the
poor, proposing: &#8216;taxation of the rents of landlords and the
profits of the capitalist for the purpose of financing schemes for
social betterment.&#8217; <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a> Now he saw
his role in this way:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It is no part of my job ... to put before the House of
Commons proposals for the expenditure of public money. The function
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as I understand it, is to resist
all demands for expenditure made by his colleagues and, when he can
no longer resist, to limit the concession to the barest point of acceptance.</p>

<p class="fst">Clutching the Treasury purse strings, Snowden described his fellow
Ministers as &#8216;a pack of ravenous wolves&#8217;. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly the &#8216;first socialist budget&#8217; contained no
surprises. Concluding his Commons presentation, Snowden remarked that
the former Tory Chancellor &#8216;claimed it was a &#8220;Tory budget&#8221; ...
Indeed I hear on authority that there is a movement in the City of
London to erect a statue to me&#8217;. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Wheatley makes his mark</h4>

<p class="fst">Against this picture must be set the one success story of the
government &#8211; John Wheatley, the solitary left-winger. His tenure at
Health was notable for his handling of Poplarism (which will be dealt
with later) and the Housing Act. The latter led to the erection of
521,700 houses before being discontinued in 1933. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a>
It slipped through Snowden&#8217;s penny-pinching grasp because its
initial cost was low. To encourage local councils to build new
houses, costs were to be subsidised from central funds over a period
of 40 years.</p>

<p>Did Wheatley&#8217;s Act prove that with the right personnel Labour
can lead the way to socialism? Alas, Wheatley&#8217;s success came from
skilfully co-ordinating capitalist industry to make it efficient. He
had the honesty to say as much himself: &#8216;The Labour Party&#8217;s
programme on housing is not a Socialist programme at all. I wish it
were.&#8217; <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a> During the final passage
of his Act through parliament Wheatley asserted:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I have left private enterprise exactly where I found it
... as the protector of the small builder I am the defender of
private enterprise and one of its best friends. I am completely frank
and honest about it ... It requires Labour proposals, Socialist
proposals if you like, in order that private enterprise can get going
again. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The overall achievement</h4>

<p class="fst">Given the mildly favourable economic circumstances in which it was
operating, even within a capitalist framework Labour could afford to
offer certain reforms and, in addition to housing, some were indeed
forthcoming. <a href="#ne" name="fe">[5*]</a> But these were only
marginally different from what the capitalist parties would have done
in the circumstances.</p>

<p>We have the word of numerous contemporary politicians for this.
The Tory MP Leo Amery wrote that Labour Ministers took &#8216;practically
the same view of things as the late Capitalist Government.&#8217; <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a>
Baldwin confided his &#8216;worries of a Party leader in days when there
are no deep political convictions to divide men of good will&#8217;. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a>
He had expected &#8216;some great revolution in method&#8217; only to find
&#8216;nothing more than a strict adherence to what has been done by the
last Government and the Government before that and the Government
before that.&#8217; <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a> Asquith felt that
&#8216;most if not all of the [prime minister&#8217;s] proposals are to be
found in the election programme of one or another of the various
parties ... It is not a new departure.&#8217; <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a>
This was a truth the Labour government was proud to acknowledge,
stating &#8216;clearly and definitely that there is no break in the
continuity of our policy.&#8217; <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a></p>

<p>One can only sympathise with the <strong>New Statesman</strong>&#8217;s sad
conclusion: &#8216;In the sphere of foreign policy there are no definable
party differences, even in home affairs party differences are by no
means clear.&#8217; <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a> MacDonald&#8217;s
eagerness to prove Labour&#8217;s worth to the ruling class meant, as the
historian of the first Labour government puts it, that: &#8216;too often
Labour&#8217;s proposals fell far short of what could reasonably be
expected &#8211; add publicly demanded of the Liberals.&#8217; <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a>
It was this desire for respectability that brought the government to
an ignominious end.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Red Bogey</h4>

<p class="fst">By the end of the summer of 1924, the opposition parties were
getting restless for power. The end came when the government botched
the &#8216;Campbell case&#8217;. On 25 July the acting editor of the
Communist <strong>Workers&#8217; Weekly</strong>, J.R. Campbell, published an open
letter calling on soldiers to refuse orders to break strikes. The
government began proceedings under the 1795 Incitement to Mutiny Act.
No sooner had this started than they discovered a prosecution was
unlikely to succeed. When the case was dropped MacDonald came under
fire in the Commons and resigned after making this issue one of confidence.</p>

<p>What made things ridiculous was that the government had got itself
into the mess because it was so keen to prove its anti-Communist
credentials. Thus MacDonald told the king: &#8216;Nothing would have
pleased me better than to have appeared in the witness box, when I
might have said some things that might have added a month or two to
the sentence.&#8217; <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a></p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s anti-Communist paranoia had destroyed the government.
It now helped lose the election. The secret service &#8216;discovered&#8217;
a letter addressed to the British Communist Party and purporting to
be from Zinoviev, the Comintern president, shortly before the vote.
It called for the creation of Communist military units in the British
army. Instead of exposing this document as an obvious forgery,
MacDonald gave it credibility by denouncing it more zealously than
the Liberals and Tories would have done, and by drafting a formal
protest, with Foreign Office connivance the &#8216;red letter&#8217; appeared
in the <strong>Daily Mail</strong> three days before polling day. Having made
so much of the letter itself. Labour was in no position to deny the
implication that the country was about to be consumed by civil war
unless a strong right-wing government were returned.</p>

<p>The real losers in the October 1924 election were the Liberals.
They fell to 42 MPs while the Tories won an outright majority with
413. Labour actually gained 1.1 million votes though they lost forty
seats, falling to 151. Despite last-minute bungling, Labour had
established itself, not as a party of real socialism (which at that
time would not have attracted many millions of votes) but as <em>the</em>
credible party to form His Majesty&#8217;s Opposition.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Conclusion: Labour in government</h4>

<p class="fst">So far we have characterised Labour as a capitalist workers&#8217;
party whose leaders attempt to mediate between the two main classes
of society. <em>This changed when Labour formed a government.</em> To
understand Why, it is useful to compare the differing roles of the
union bureaucrat and reformist politician.</p>

<p>The union official is squeezed between workers&#8217; collective
organisation in production on one side and the need to negotiate
deals with the bosses on the other. As Clynes described it: &#8216;He is
a man who works for two masters ... The men who appoint have the
right to demand his loyalty, and the employers with whom he has to
deal on behalf of the men expect fairness and reason.&#8217; <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a>
To function at all officials must maintain some relationship with the
rank and file or their deals cannot be made to stick. Furthermore,
while union leaders may be invited to meet management or even
participate in some joint committee, they are never made respon&shy;sible
for the running of the capitalist operation.</p>

<p>There are no such constraints on Labour governments. Their chief
link with ordinary workers is not through collective organisation but
the passive medium of voting, and even this ceases once the polling
booths shut. <em>It is a mistake to see electoralism as the key
determinant of Labour&#8217;s behaviour</em>, for it totally fails to
explain why Labour governments have indulged in policies which are
obviously going to lose votes from the working class &#8211; on whom the
party&#8217;s electoral fortunes depend.</p>

<p>From the moment they take office therefore, ministers are freed
from any but the most indirect working-class pressure (via the TUC,
the party&#8217;s national executive or perhaps extra-parliamentary
action) but are fully responsible for the bourgeois state. What makes
their situation worse is that while the cabinet is formally head of
the &#8216;management team&#8217;, its real influence is circumscribed on all
sides &#8211; by civil servants, army chiefs and above all by the
capitalist economy. <em>Labour is compelled to bow down before the
&#8216;national&#8217; element in the class/nation equation.</em> This
dictates the degree to which Labour governments can deliver reforms.</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#fa" name="na">1*.</a> This tenderness to
the feelings of civil servants did not extend to lower grades who had
been agitating for the right to vote and affiliate to political
organisations. The TUC was behind their claim, as was <strong>Labour and
the New Social Order.</strong> Whatever the minority position of Labour in
the Commons, the government could freely alter civil service
regulations and yet, as W J Brown of the Clerical Association told
the 1925 Labour Conference: &#8216;while the Labour Government was in
office ... the Treasury Committee to which the matter had been
referred, produced a Report which left Civil Servants in rather a
worse position than they were in before.&#8217; <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fb" name="nb">2*.</a> Perhaps pathetic would be the more
appropriate epithet. Beatrice Webb&#8217;s diary records how: &#8216;Uncle
Arthur [Henderson] was bursting with childish joy over his Home
Office seals in the red leather box which he handed round the
company; Sidney was chuckling over a hitch in the solemn ceremony in
which he had been right and Hankey [chief of the Cabinet Secretariat]
wrong; they were all laughing over Wheatley &#8211; -the revolutionary &#8211;
going down on both knees and actually kissing the King&#8217;s hand.&#8217; <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fc" name="nc">3*.</a> Clynes, Home Secretary in the
second Labour government, overcame his loathing of hanging and
flogging by reasoning that however strong my desire to change it may
be ... it is the right of the public to <em>change</em> the law. It is
the duty of the Minister to <em>apply</em> the law.&#8217; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>[<a href="#fd" name="nd">4*.</a> The two Tories were Lord
Chelmsford, former colonial governor and Viceroy of India, &#8216;a real
aristocrat of the traditional type&#8217; <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a>
and Lord Parmoor, father of Stafford Cripps. He was a lifelong
Conservative, Churchman and believer in &#8220;Christian methods&#8221; in
government, who made a reputation ... defending employers&#8217; rights
in relation to Workmen&#8217;s Compensation&#8217;. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a>
The most prominent former Liberal was Lord Haldane a vocal supporter
of the Taff Vale judgement.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fe" name="ne">5*.</a> Clegg gives the following summary
of the chief social reforms:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Trevelyan at the Board of Education, increased the
grants to schools starved of money ... and set up the Hadow Committee
to devise means of providing secondary education for all.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8216;Shaw at the ministry of Labour, was responsible for
two Unemployment Insurance Acts. The first abolished the gap of three
weeks between periods of benefit ... The second combined a number of
administrative improvements with a substantial improvement in
benefits &#8211; from 75p to 90p a week for men [etc.]&#8217; <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p class="note">In addition Labour cut the navy&#8217;s cruiser-building programme
from eight to five (still far higher than its pacifist programme
suggested) and ceased work on a naval base at Singapore.</p>
