<h1>17. New Labour</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">WHEN this book first appeared in 1988 it was generally accepted
that &#8216;Popular capitalism&#8217; had triumphed. The working class was
disappearing and socialist politics were irrelevant. Moreover, many
argued that Labour was unlikely ever to get into office. The British
Communist Party&#8217;s now defunct <strong>Marxism Today</strong> talked of &#8216;the
development of the Conservative Party into the single dominant
party&#8217;. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> The <strong>New Statesman</strong>
added, &#8216;Socialism died with the Russian Empire [and] the Labour
Party has been brain dead; it is time someone switched off the life
support system&#8217;. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> But the 1990s have
turned out somewhat differently.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The fall of Thatcher and the poll tax</h4>

<p class="fst">Until the moment she fell in 1990 Margaret Thatcher was regarded
as &#8216;one of the most astute and powerful of contemporary political
leaders.&#8217; <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> Five years later Blair
was still attempting to follow her by making &#8216;New Labour&#8217; &#8216;the
true expression of the radical &#8220;anti-Establishment&#8221; spirit of the
Reagan/Thatcher administrations.&#8217; <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a>
Labour had given Thatcherism a free run and, as the <strong>Observer</strong>&#8217;s
editor Will Hutton says: &#8216;While individual countries may have at
least one horror story of radical marketisation similar to Britain&#8217;s,
only Britain can tell them all ... No Western industrialised country
in the twentieth century has been subjected to such fast and
excessive marketisation.&#8217; <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> How
successful was this for British capitalism?</p>

<p class="quoteb">The economic miracle of a country ranking bottom of the
OECD turns out, upon cursory inspection of the mandate reality, to be
a &#8216;gigantic con-trick&#8217; ... They touted the startling improvement
in the productivity of manufacturing industry, delivered by the
destruction of 2.5 million jobs, and a radical legislative reduction
of union power. This improvement, however, amounted to the capacity
to produce the same output with one third fewer workers ... Meanwhile
Britain&#8217;s competitors increased their output by more than half
(Japan), one third (USA), or a quarter (Germany) ... From 1979 to
1992 UK GDP had grown by a mere 1.75 percent per annum ... an
unparalleled post war disaster in half a century spoilt for choice.
<a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The key long term impact of Thatcher and her successors has meant
that between 1994 and 1995 Britain&#8217;s standing in &#8216;world
competitiveness&#8217; was 18th out of 48, well below Singapore, Hong
Kong and Taiwan, while it was 21st for &#8216;domestic economic
strength.&#8217; <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p>Thatcher was not brought down by British capitalism or Labour, <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a>
but by an anti poll tax campaign which saw some 11 million people
breaking the law to withhold payment of the tax and a huge riot in
Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p>The poll tax symbolised a Thatcherism bloated by easy election
victories. Replacing local rates with a tax that had dukes paying the
same as cleaners was immensely unpopular. Labour&#8217;s response was to
review its own policies. Kinnock said this was the &#8216;precondition
for defeating Thatcherism&#8217;, requiring &#8216;socialists to face up to
the realities ... To recognise it is not defeatism, accommodation of
Thatcherism or collaboration with Thatcherism, it is the opposite.&#8217;
<a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> Anything else was anathema. So even
before poll tax forms were issued in 1988 Kinnock &#8216;warned that
frustration should not explode into futile illegality and so play
into the Tories&#8217; hands&#8217;. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a> David
Blunkett, then Labour&#8217;s local government spokesman, insisted &#8216;we
will be successful in removing the poll tax [only] by removing the
Government which imposed it.&#8217; <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p>When anti poll tax unions flourished anyway, the Party joined
union leaders in the &#8216;Stop-It&#8217; campaign. This was more concerned
with containing non-payment than with overturning the Tories&#8217;
legislation. Labour&#8217;s stance was tested in the Glasgow Govan
by-election where its candidate had pledged non-payment but was
rapidly brought to heel by Party HQ. The Scottish Nationalist stood
on an anti poll tax ticket increasing the SNP&#8217;s vote an astonishing
five fold to win from a previous fourth place. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>Labour concluded that in future candidates must tow the official
line more closely. Changes were made helping Headquarters impose
candidates over locally selected ones. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a>
By early 1990 Labour was threatening to discipline Tower Hamlets
councillors who refused to prosecute poll tax non payers and
withdrawing the whip from 16 Liverpool councillors over the issue.
<a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p>As protests erupted outside town halls Labour &#8216;launched the
second ... phase of its poll tax campaign&#8217;. Bryan Gould declared
people should protest by joining the Party while the planned 1 April
national demonstration was &#8216;cancelled due to lack of money&#8217;. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a>
Involvement in anti poll tax unions by Labour&#8217;s own membership was
minimal reaching just 4 per cent. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p>On 31 March 1990 an enormous anti poll tax demonstration in
Trafalgar Square was attacked by police and turned into a riot in
which 340 were arrested. The Home Secretary blamed Labour.
Hattersley, Shadow Home Secretary was outraged: &#8216;The Labour Party
condemns, without reservation or qualification, the violence which
took place ... no cause can justify such conduct. It is literally
intolerable. May I offer the sympathy of Opposition Members to those
police officers who were injured [and call] for exemplary sentences
for those who were convicted.&#8217; <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a>
Nevertheless, the result was &#8216;the most spectacular reversal of a
flagship policy ever seen in Britain&#8217;. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p>Incredibly, Blunkett now claimed: &#8216;It was our campaign and it
was our belief in the policies that we were putting forward that
ensured that the poll tax eventually met its doom&#8217;. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a>
The Party turned on those who really beat the tax, arguing: &#8216;The
biggest threat to Labour losing the advantage we currently hold comes
from those in our ranks who publicly advocate non payment ... Warrant
sales cannot be avoided.&#8217; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a>
Hackney, where Labour had 58 out of 70 council seats, issued 40,000
court summonses. Labour even criticised the government for being
&#8216;lazy&#8217; in closing loopholes in rules for prosecution of
non-payers. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a> Meanwhile Cherie
Booth, &#163;200,000 per annum lawyer wife of the future Party leader
Tony Blair (and former Labour candidate herself), demanded a
penniless poll tax defaulter should stay in prison. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a>
Two thirds of all those jailed had a Labour council to thank. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p>However, the Glasgow Govan experience was not repeated south of
the border. There was no electoral alternative to Labour, so it
benefited from the protest vote. The mid-Staffordshire by-election
(March 1990) saw Labour&#8217;s biggest swing since 1935. In May the
Tories suffered their worst local government results ever. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a>
The opinion polls between the 1987 and 1992 elections showed rising
non-payment and demonstrations boosting Labour&#8217;s popularity and
destroying the Tories&#8217;. This was thrown away partly because Labour
collected the tax as viciously as the Tories.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Labour&#8217;s Gulf War syndrome</h4>

<p class="fst">John Major succeeded Thatcher in November 1990, a political
lightweight chosen as a compromise leader to keep out Michael
Heseltine. Major had been closely involved with the hated poll tax
and was suspected of being Thatcher&#8217;s puppet. When he took office
in November 1990 he and Kinnock were close in popularity ratings. By
the spring of 1991 Major&#8217;s personal rating was almost double that
of Kinnock&#8217;s. One reason was the way Kinnock aped the Tories, as
was shown clearly in the Gulf War.</p>

<p>War began with Iraq&#8217;s invasion of Kuwait in August 1991. The US
seized the opportunity to tighten its grip on world oil supplies and
assert its position as the world&#8217;s leading superpower. The US
government coordinated an invasion of Kuwait and Iraq by thousands of
American and European troops. Anywhere between 100,000 and 250,000
Iraqi troops and civilians were killed, many in the infamous &#8216;turkey
shoot&#8217; of soldiers trapped on the Basra road. Kurds and Marsh
Arabs, duped by Allied statements, rose up against the Iraqi regime
only to be abandoned. Many died and 2 million Kurds fled into the mountains.</p>

<p>Liberal and even not so liberal opinion was worried by US
President Bush&#8217;s hectic rush towards military conflict. But the
Labour leadership matched every jingoistic statement of the Tory
government point for point. Yet an early survey of backbench Labour
MPs showed 80 percent against immediate military action, with 25
percent rejecting war outright. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a>
Slavish obedience to the leadership outweighed conscience for all but
a minority. Labour failed to argue for delaying war. It even avoided
calling a Parliamentary debate on policy during the entire conflict.
This was unique in British history. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p>As war approached Labour MPs asked incredulously why the Party was
not setting out its own position. Kinnock replied: &#8216;In the variety
of discussions that have taken place some say that I should, as they
put it &#8220;distance&#8221; myself from the Government. I will not distance
myself.&#8217; <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> Once the war began
Major was subjected to a torrent of Kinnock&#8217;s sustained grovelling:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I join the PM in his thoughts for the families ... May I
take this opportunity of supporting the feeling expressed by the
Prime Minister ... The Prime Minister has been right, both today and
on previous occasions ... The Prime Minister gave fair notice to
Saddam Hussein. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Kinnock&#8217;s position was to the right of Edward Heath, much of the
US Congress, and even the Pope. When the Parliamentary Party now
discussed the issue, the vote was 5 to 1 in favour of prolonging the
slaughter as against a ceasefire. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a>
An NEC meeting took the same position but &#8216;twelve hours after [it]
rejected a ceasefire in the Gulf, Bush and his allies declared one&#8217;. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p>Some left MPs did protest <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> and
five resigned Labour&#8217;s front bench. One said, &#8216;The vast majority
of us are deeply depressed. We feel this is horrendous, the beginning
of something dreadful&#8217;, while a backbencher described his
colleagues&#8217; feeling of &#8216;guilt and shame&#8217;. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a>
Largely because of Labour&#8217;s position, the British anti-war movement
was small, whereas elsewhere vast demonstrations took place, with
400,000 in Algeria, 100,000 in San Francisco and 300,000 in
Washington. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a> Bernie Grant blamed
the weakness on &#8216;Labour MPs who lurked in supper clubs and bars
mumbling their disagreement, afraid of damaging their political
careers.&#8217; <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a> The &#8216;supper club&#8217;
was a rallying point for left MPs but when a <strong>Daily Mail</strong>
reporter crashed a meeting, &#8216;at least three of these brave souls
dived under tables in an attempt to hide their identities from the
public and, presumably, the leader&#8217;s private office.&#8217; <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a></p>

<p>The leadership&#8217;s connivance in mass murder was justified by
electoralism. Kinnock said: &#8216;We must save the Party [and] make
clear we are not pacifists.&#8217; <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a> Yet
before the war Labour was 15 points ahead in the polls, after it was
5 points behind. The poll tax dividend had been squandered and the
next election probably decided.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The 1992 election</h4>

<p class="fst">For the 1992 general election policies were comprehensively
overhauled. Kinnock scorned &#8216;those who say they do not want victory
at such a price.&#8217; <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a> Thirst for
office gripped the Party membership: &#8216;The new generation of younger
members was much more self disciplined, business-like and single
minded in its ambition for power.&#8217; <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a>
Labour&#8217;s left and right spoke with one voice as never before. As
Livingstone put it: &#8216;If the chief aim is to fight [the Tories] it
is absolutely necessary to unite with those who support the general
policies of the party leadership in order to do so.&#8217; <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p>The 1992 General Election should have been a gift for Labour.
Instead it was:</p>

<p class="quoteb">a remarkable victory for the Conservatives. To win by
such a margin of votes over Labour (7.6 percent) was totally
unexpected. It was achieved in the trough of the longest depression
since the 1930s and at the end of a campaign that had been much
derided. It went against the trend elsewhere in Europe, where
established government parties were meeting electoral rebuffs. The
fourth successive election victory meant that by the end of the new
parliament the Conservatives would have been in office continuously
for 18 years &#8211; the longest period of one party rule since the Great
Reform Act of 1832. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The road to defeat in 1992 was laid by Peter Mandelson and Philip
Gould&#8217;s Shadow Communications Agency (SCA). It began with a
presentation to the Shadow Cabinet and NEC by pollsters which
&#8216;exploded on some of those present like a grenade.&#8217; <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a>
Henceforth, opinion polls were accorded the mysterious power for
prediction given to astrologers. The SCA forged &#8216;an approach to
political strategy which has never before been seen &#8211; certainly in
the Labour Party, and arguably, even in British politics. They
wielded policy, politics and image creation into one weapon&#8217;. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a>
Now, Labour&#8217;s values and the people&#8217;s values were &#8211; abracadabra
&#8211; identical&#8217;. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a> Supporters were
told that image was the key and indeed, in 1992:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Labour gained good marks for its campaign. Since 1987 it
had dropped virtually all left wing policies and embraced modern
campaigning methods even more fully. With the exception of the
promise of higher rates of taxation for the better off, it had
accepted most of Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s achievements in the 1980s. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Even after the event &#8216;all the surveys ... reported that Labour
fought a better campaign than the Conservatives.&#8217; <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s approach foundered for three reasons. First, as Hugo
Young admitted ruefully: &#8216;The opinion poll business has proved to
rest on fantasy.&#8217; <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a> Second, even
if they had been accurate, Labour leaders read polls selectively. On
24 March Labour&#8217;s Party Political Broadcast told the true story of
two girls, one who received prompt private treatment for &#8216;flu ear&#8217;
while another suffered awaiting treatment under the Tories&#8217;
reformed NHS. &#8216;Even opponents acknowledged that it was superbly
done; members of the panel on which it was tested before transmission
were said to have been moved to tears.&#8217; <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a>
The three polls preceding the broadcast put Labour 2.7 percent
behind. The three polls after showed Labour gained an average 8.3
percent. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a> So the Party dropped
health! &#8216;Labour&#8217;s leaders were themselves scared of the message
in the broadcast, nervous of what one insider called its &#8220;class war
propaganda&#8221;.&#8217; <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a> Unbelievably
they switched, in what was the final week, to promoting Proportional
Representation. With pollsters reported the NS the single most
important issue with 93 percent of voters backing higher NHS
expenditure. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a> Labour concentrated
on policies which could hardly have been weaker. This brings us to
the third point. Labour policies are not primarily shaped by public
opinion. The dictates of capitalism are far more important.</p>
<p>Labour&#8217;s vote did rise &#8211; by 3.5 percent &#8211; during the
election. Given the poll tax fiasco and recession this is not
surprising. Labour&#8217;s 11.5 million votes were 3 million fewer than
the number of summonses and warrants issued to poll-tax non-payers, a
group the Party assiduously avoided courting. The social composition
of its vote also changed. Amongst the unemployed Labour&#8217;s share
actually fell as compared to 1987, and its share of the poorest and
most numerous social grouping (D/E) remained completely static. With
the <strong>Financial Times</strong>, of all papers, calling for the Tories&#8217;
defeat, Labour&#8217;s greatest gains were made at the top end &#8211; the
smallest and wealthiest group A/B. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a></p>

<p>Until 1974 supporters strongly identifying with Labour always
exceeded those of the Tories. The Wilson/Callaghan government broke
the bonds of loyalty and Kinnock had done nothing to restore them.
<a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a> Yet the leadership blamed defeat
on its tax proposals. An authoritative study shows &#8216;there is very
little evidence&#8217; for this. Those who intended to vote Labour but
changed their mind were not &#8216;particularly adverse to high taxation,
rather they seemed to be people who had relatively little faith in
Labour&#8217;s ability to improve services like health and education ...
taxation may actually have lost the Conservatives some votes between
1987 and 1992.&#8217; <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a></p>

<p>In the fourteen general elections since 1945 Labour had only done
worse in 1983 and 1987. The abandonment of one principle after
another, its Gulf War policy and so much more had been designed to
win this election. The interests of millions of workers were, win or
lose, being betrayed by the Party they hoped would help them. This
was not the conclusion the Labour leadership drew. After the election
it rounded on the trade unions.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The mines tragedy</h4>

<p class="fst">Electoral defeat brought a leadership context. Rule changes in
1988 <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a> meant no left wing candidate
was able to stand for the first time since the 1930s. The choice was
John Smith or Brian Gould. In a <strong>Financial Times</strong> poll of
businessmen Smith was a more popular choice for Chancellor than the
Tories&#8217; Norman Lamont. Gould was famous for his &#8216;leapfrog over
Thatcherism&#8217; speech. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a> Smith won
with 91 percent.</p>

<p>Labour had based its strategy on the disappearance of class as a
political issue. In October 1992 this non existent force suddenly
reappeared at centre stage and since then, in opinion poll terms,
Labour has never looked back. Michael Heseltine&#8217;s plan to shut 31
pits created a massive protest. Two enormous demonstrations on
Wednesday 20 and Sunday 25 October, numbering nearly a quarter of a
million between them, marched through London. The <strong>Sun</strong>&#8217;s
headline was &#8216;Is Major a goner?&#8217; <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>

<p>The labour movement had slowly recovered confidence since the
defeats of the mid 1980s. There had been no comparable setbacks since
then, while the poll tax movement&#8217;s spectacular demolition of
Thatcher showed Tory vulnerability. However, the mines movement
differed from the anti poll tax movement. Labour had not been able to
derail non payment since this had in large part been organised on a
localised basis at a grass roots level. Defending the pits however
demanded a collective centralised leadership. Demonstrations,
important as they were, would not be enough. Mass strike action was necessary.</p>

<p>Two months before the threatened closures Labour&#8217;s energy
spokesperson told the NUM &#8216;in a speech ringing of defeatism&#8217; that
&#8216;the cards are heavily stacked against keep coal in the public
sector.&#8217; <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a> Still, the TUC and the
Labour Party had the potential to force the government into headlong
retreat. Tories and Labour alike realised this. Ex-Tory Minister,
Cecil Parkinson, admitted on TV &#8216;The government seems to have lost
control&#8217;, <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a> while David Blunkett
for Labour boasted: &#8216;I could have asked for a general election.
Maybe we&#8217;d have got one as well.&#8217; <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a></p>

<p>At first Labour treated the issue as a TUC matter while the TUC
insisted that, with the support of dissident Tory MPs, the
Parliamentary Labour Party would save the day for the miners in
parliament. When protests grew:</p>

<p class="quoteb">John Smith did turn up at the big rally in Hyde Park. His
absence would have been embarrassing ... he urged the &#8216;public&#8217; to
keep up the pressure. As mining communities were attacked during the
winter and spring he said nothing. He did not even reply to the NUM&#8217;s
appeal for support for a one day strike. He addressed the
Confederation of British Industry conference and ... caused his
audience to laugh nine times. <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a></p>

<p class="fst">No further national demonstrations were countenanced and the
movement was dissipated in regional events.</p>

<p>Labour says Parliament is the proper place to achieve progress yet
its performance here was pathetic. It weakly accepted vague promises
from Heseltine that if the Labour chaired Select Committee on Trade
and Industry produced a unanimous report on the pits he would adopt
it. Such compliance would have been unique in select committee
history. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a></p>

<p>In February 1993 the eagerly awaited report appeared. Twenty of
the 31 pits were still to close. After months of prevarication Labour
MPs were too demoralised even to vote against Heseltine when he
ignored the committee&#8217;s findings. In the NEC report to Labour&#8217;s
1993 conference the mines merited half a page, the witch-hunt against
the Labour left filled three. The <strong>New Statesman</strong> concluded:
&#8216;Here, out of the blue, was an opportunity not given to oppositions
even one in a decade. A monumental gaffe by government, which had the
burghers of Cheltenham marching in the streets and Catholic priests
pronouncing anathema in the pulpits.&#8217; The Party&#8217;s failure showed
&#8216;inertia, amounting to almost intellectual and political paralysis
that appears to have seized Labour.&#8217; <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a></p>

<p>In the months afterwards there were a spate of industrial
struggles on the railways, at Fords, amongst firefighters and at the
Timex factory in Dundee. The period since then has seen a continuing
slow and patchy revival in the working class movement, the victory of
the railway signal workers in 1994 being a prominent example.</p>

<p>However, the pattern seen in the pit closures has been repeated a
number of times. Though Labour has sought to distance itself from
unions, the symbolic relationship between the Labour and union
bureaucracies continues. One sign of continued Labour influence on
the levels of class struggle has been shown in a survey showing that
in a sample of 500 strike ballots two thirds produced &#8216;yes&#8217; votes
but in only 82 did action occur. In 1995 massive votes for industrial
action in the NHS, which saw even the Royal College of Nurses
abandoning its no strike status, were side tracked by hope that a
Labour government would repair the damage inflicted by the Tories. As
the next election nears the union bureaucrats resist action every
more strongly. In early 1996 an important strike of Liverpool dockers
sacked for refusing to cross picket lines has been shamelessly
abandoned by the Transport union. Blair is aloof from the trade
unions yet uses his links with the union leaders to quell discontent.
A direct example was when &#8216;Senior Shadow Cabinet members&#8217; warned

<h4>One Member One Vote (OMOV) &#8211; Weakening the union link</h4>

<p class="fst">The links between trade unions and the Labour Party continue to be
an important issue for socialists today. Together, the trade union
bureaucracy and the Labour Party weave reformism out of a blend of
working class and capitalist class influence.</p>
<p>Union class consciousness is very durable. Despite the pressure of
capitalist ideas the daily experience of exploitation, the permanent
trench warfare over conditions and pay provides a social reality at
odds with the dominant ideology. Even at times of defeat like the
1980s, when many felt impotent in the face of the bosses and their
legal system, class distinctions between boss and worker were
self-evident. Despite all the bureaucratic obstacles in the way of
its expression, this consciousness does influence the Labour Party
via its union connection.</p>

<p>Apart from this connection the PLP is far removed from working
class influence. The ballot box has no connection with the workplace
while MPs work within the constraints of Parliament, an institution
deeply imbued with capitalist tradition. Thus, in the battle between
working class and ruling class ideas the PLP is influenced more by
capitalist pressure than unions.</p>

<p>The individual membership of the Party is both numerically smaller
than the unions and less rooted in immediate class experience. It is
therefore more volatile. Until recently it was mostly left of the
unions because it drew general political conclusions from the
experience of the class. Today, with a membership which lacks roots
in key areas of class organisation, much of the membership generalise
from electoral defeat to draw right wing conclusions. Falling levels
of activism further this process. Activists may be involved in
debate, demonstrations and campaigns. Passive members, by contrast,
are more easily influenced by right win ideas, a rightward shift that
moving away from links with trade unions is likely to accentuate.</p>

<p>The process of weakening union links began in earnest after the
1987 defeat. Kinnock clearly outlined the intentions of the strategy
when he said Labour governments &#8216;have to go against the unions in
the national interest, so why shouldn&#8217;t the Labour leader in normal
party matters?&#8217; <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a></p>

<p>By the early 1990s policy making, which used to take place in
Labour&#8217;s NEC (which includes members elected by union votes at
conference) had been informally transferred to policy review
committees and then to the Shadow Cabinet. The unions also agreed to
reduce their share of votes in leadership elections from 90 to 50 percent.</p>

<p>Defeat in the 1992 election brought a carefully prepared ambush of
the unions. Tom Sawyer of NUPE (forerunner of Unison) writes: &#8216;I
was immediately overwhelmed with requests to offer my opinions on
Labour&#8217;s links with the trade unions - an issue which had hardly
featured in the election. This was puzzling at first ... I now
understand that there were influential people in the party who are
prepared in the event of defeat, for a concerted attack on the trade
union link.&#8217; <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a></p>

<p>One &#8216;influential&#8217; person was Blair. Without consultation, he
had already withdrawn Labour support for the union closed shop on the
grounds that the European Social Charter gives the right to &#8216;join
or not to join a union&#8217;. <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a> Blair
allowed the Tories to sweep away the closed shop, but there is still
no right to join a union. &#8216;Blair&#8217;s coup&#8217; targeted something
which one biographer says: &#8216;inevitably appeals to the party&#8217;s
instinct for archaic forms of solidarity&#8217;. <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a>
This action led some to see Blair as a future contender for the
leadership. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a></p>

<p>After the election Blair was determined &#8216;to strike instantly&#8217;
<a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a> believing that &#8216;if Labour loses
the next election it will be the fault of Bill Morris&#8217; and the
other union leaders. <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a> This is quite
simply wrong. In 1992 only 4 percent of voters gave unions as a
reason for not voting Labour, while 20 percent mentioned Kinnock.
<a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a> Opinion polls showed rising
support for trade unions. Those opposing further anti union
legislation easily outstrip Labour&#8217;s share of the vote, while a
massive 79 percent in 1992supported giving workers more say in
running their work. <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a> Popular
opinion was not driving the campaign against union links forward.
Again it was the pressure on the Labour leaders to appease the ruling class.</p>

<p>The union/Labour link is maintained principally through union
leaders and some resisted the erosion of their influence. Ron Toddof
the Transport Union lambasted Labour&#8217;s &#8216;modernisers and reformers
with sharp suits and cordless telephones&#8217;, reporting &#8216;a certain
middle class embarrassment in some circles at the idea of belonging
to a movement which remains dominated by working-class organisations.
They need our money and our strength, but they resent our power.&#8217;
<a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a> As the offensive intensified after
the 1992election an exasperated Morris, Todd&#8217;s successor asked,
&#8216;Has Labour got a death wish? ... the whole issue of Labour&#8217;s
future has been reduced in a few short weeks to the trade union
problem.&#8217; <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a></p>

<p>It was at Labour&#8217;s 1993 Conference that key decisions were
taken. The Party leadership wanted parliamentary candidates selected
by individual members only (one member, one vote &#8211; OMOV). Local
trade unions would lose their 40 percent vote. Ins electing the
Labour leader union participation would be cut to one third. The
debate lasted throughout the spring and summer of 1993. The media
warned that Labour was unelectable without OMOV and then conducted
polls designed to show that people were more likely to vote Labour if
OMOV were adopted. As <em>Tribune</em> pointed out: &#8216;One might as
well ask if people are in favour of free ice cream and chocolate&#8217;.
<a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a> The label &#8216;one man one vote&#8217;
was a misnomer. John Edmonds of the GMB pointed out it meant &#8216;denying
union levy payers any say ... OMOV means a narrower franchise. Fewer
people will be consulted and fewer people will vote.&#8217; <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a>
Morris added that the proposals for electing the leader &#8216;would make
each MP&#8217;s vote equivalent to that of more than two constituency
parties. Less than 300 Labour MPs would have the same share of the
vote as more than 200,000 individual members ... What the modernisers
really want is: one MP loads of votes&#8217;. Their decision would carry
as much force as that of 4 million trade unionists. <a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a></p>

<p>In the end Conference approved OMOV (along with a special
membership rate for trade unionists to join locally) by the narrowest
of margins. To win this Smith was forced to announce his conversion
to &#8216;the goal of full employment &#8211; at the heart of Labour&#8217;s
vision&#8217;. <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a> John Prescott cashed in
his left wing credentials calling on delegates to &#8216;give us a bit of
trust&#8217;. <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a> Still it required
strenuous arm twisting and sharp practice to get OMOV through. For
example, 750 delegates at the postal workers&#8217; union conference
voted by a majority to reject Smith&#8217;s scheme but at Labour&#8217;s
Conference the 19 delegates voted in favour. The MSF was committed to
opposition, but a secret meeting from which a left wing delegate was
excluded chose to withdraw its 4.5 percent from the anti OMOV camp.
OMOV passed by a 3.1 percent margin.</p>

<p>The union leaders could have sunk Smith&#8217;s plan, but they had an
Achilles heel. They need the goodwill of the Party leadership in the
event of a Labour government. That is why 80 percent of them
supported OMOV. <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a></p>

<p>How has OMOV affected the union/Labour link? Trade unions still
have connections via affiliation to CLPs, individual membership, NEC
elections (12 seats), Labour conference and other channels. The Party
is financially dependent on union support (&#163;4.7m out of the &#163;8.8m
total in 1993). Blair wishes to mirror Bill Clinton&#8217;s Democrats,
but Clinton raised more corporate cash than the Republicans. Despite
its efforts, Labour&#8217;s leaders have not managed to win major
sponsorship from big business and as one union leader nicely put it &#8211;
&#8216;No say, no pay&#8217;. <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a></p>

<p>So OMOV does not represent a final break with the unions, tough
the link is weakening. For example, in 1985 Labour had 98 workplace
branches. Today they have all but disappeared. <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a>
The decline of channels for working class influence encourages
further capitulation to ruling class ideas making it easier to cut
influence again, and so on. The stampede to the right has been less
restrained as a result.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>New Labour&#8217;s new members</h4>

<p class="fst">OMOV raised the issue of Labour&#8217;s dwindling membership, which
was 261,000 in 1992, just 60,000 more than the Liberals. The fiction
of OMOV democracy required constituency members. There was also
convincing academic evidence, after yet another election defeat, that
local canvassing actually wins votes, up to 5 percent more. <a href="#n83" name="f83">[83]</a></p>

<p>The problem for Labour Party leaders was political volunteers
working without the lure of expense claims and Parliamentary salaries
might actually be socialists. If the membership were expanded it must
be tamed and neutralised. So the witch hunt against left wingers in
the party was stepped up. In 1990 the Socialist Organiser grouping
was exiled followed by the Militant organisation in Liverpool,
including 29 sitting councillors. At the 1991 Conference 200 more
were suspended and threatened with expulsion. Meantime, &#8216;Young
Labour&#8217; was being &#8216;sanitised to death.&#8217; <a href="#n84" name="f84">[84]</a>
Ken Livingstone described the tactics as &#8216;completely Stalinist&#8217;.
<a href="#n85" name="f85">[85]</a></p>

<p>Within local Parties debate and discussion involving activists
were replaced by ballots of the whole membership. Since half the
membership hardly attend meetings and less than a third attend
frequently <a href="#n86" name="f86">[86]</a> this abolished informed
collective debate.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The passive, depoliticised individual membership now
adumbrated would not be obliged to do anything quite so heavy as
attend branch meetings, participate in debates, and resolve to
support candidate Y or policy Z in the light of collective
discussion. Rather, drawing a residue of political activists, they
would ratify by postal ballot, in the privacy of their own homes, the
will of a more centralised leadership which had already arrogated
powers to screen parliamentary candidates. Under the guise of
extending democracy, the leadership was further circumscribing it ...
Apparent decentralisation of power concealed actual centralisation of
sovereignty. <a href="#n87" name="f87">[87]</a></p>

<p class="fst">OMOV was presented as bringing Labour closer to its supporters. In
fact its membership had drifted away from the voters. As a study by
Seyd and Whiteley showed though once composed largely of ordinary
workers it was now dominated by well intentioned professionals.
Whereas 57 percent of Labour voters were industrial workers, only 26
percent of members were in this category. The &#8216;salariat&#8217; gives
Labour 14 percent of its total vote but formed 49 percent of its
membership. <a href="#n88" name="f88">[88]</a> Household incomes
revealed the same pattern. In 1990 6 percent of Labour voters earned
more than &#163;20,000 per annum, among members it was 30 percent. <a href="#n89" name="f89">[89]</a>
It was claimed Labour&#8217;s activists were unrepresentative extremists
while right wing policies matched the general membership&#8217;s views.
In fact, even in the &#8216;new model party&#8217; members&#8217; views were left
of the leadership. A full 68 percent were for unilateral disarmament;
a massive 92 percent thought taxes should be increased to spend more
on services <a href="#n90" name="f90">[90]</a> and 71 percent
favoured more nationalisation. The remoulding of the membership did
not eliminate left wing ideas but ensured passivity. In 1990 20
percent reported being more active over the last five years; 43
percent were less active. <a href="#n91" name="f91">[91]</a></p>

<p>In this context it was now safe for the leadership to expand Party
membership to undercut union influence. By April 1995 the figure
reached 320,000 having grown 93,000 in a year. <a href="#n92" name="f92">[92]</a>
Although one quarter of the intake were trade unionists <a href="#n93" name="f93">[93]</a>,
the head of Labour&#8217;s membership team calls them &#8216;non-political
people&#8217;. <a href="#n94" name="f94">[94]</a> One activist remarked:
&#8216;There are people becoming members who would actively dislike the
idea of socialism&#8217;. <a href="#n95" name="f95">[95]</a> The
<strong>Financial Times</strong> concurs: &#8216;The types of people who have
joined the Labour Party, self employed, small business people, young
men and women, are not interested in that old Labour message.&#8217; <a href="#n96" name="f96">[96]</a>
Interestingly very few of the new members pay the full &#163;18 annual
subscription, the proportion of all members doing so having fallen
from 48 percent in 1993 to 40 percent in 1995. Since the party spends
more in servicing the passive members than they contribute, the
unions are subsidising the reduction of their own influence. <a href="#n97" name="f97">[97]</a>
Even given all of this it is still probable that many new members
joined because their hatred of the Tory government outweighs the
effects of Labour&#8217;s shift to the right.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Labour left&#8217;s manic depression</h4>

<p class="fst">These changes in the composition of the party has affected the
Labour left. In 1981 Tony Benn received 81.1 percent of the
constituency vote in the campaign for party leader, in 1988 it was
18.8 percent. <a href="#n98" name="f98">[98]</a> In 1989 Ken
Livingstone lost his seat on the NEC, and in 1993 Benn was ousted
after three and a half decades on that body. Until then &#8216;constituency
parties&#8217; representatives on the NEC, first elected by constituency
delegates in 1937, [were] consistently and overwhelmingly on the
party&#8217;s left&#8217;. <a href="#n99" name="f99">[99]</a> By the 1990s
the left were a minority, though the right has not succeeded in
wiping it out, with Dennis Skinner and Dianne Abbott retaining seats
in 1995 while &#8216;moderniser&#8217; Jack Straw lost his. Labour&#8217;s left
has proved relatively powerless against the leadership&#8217;s right wing authoritarianism.</p>

<p>A sign of the reformist left&#8217;s disintegration was the closure of
much of its press: <strong>News on Sunday</strong> (June 1987); <strong>New
Socialist</strong> and <strong>Labour Weekly</strong> (Oct 1987); <strong>Marxism Today</strong>
(December 1991); the <strong>Socialist</strong> (June 1992); <strong>Spare Rib</strong>
(February 1993). This leaves the newly launched <strong>Red Pepper</strong> and
<strong>Tribune</strong>, its circulation down to 5,000 from a high of 40,000.
The fate of the Tribune Group exemplifies the trend:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Its once passionate and well attended weekly meetings had
dwindled to directionless once-a-month gatherings attended sometime
by as few as four or five MPs... Only a few years before it had been
touted as the new powerhouse of the PLP but it was now an
irrelevance, without ideology or purpose, eviscerated by the disease
of leadership loyalty. <a href="#n100" name="f100">[100]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Sometimes the situation is acknowledged. Skinner says: &#8216;The
elimination of alternative viewpoints within the Labour Party is now
more thorough than it has ever been ... We have a small group of
people at the top of the party controlling everything and putting a
firm stop to any dissent.&#8217; <a href="#n101" name="f101">[101]</a>
Benn thinks &#8216;Socialism has been explicitly repudiated ... People
who have given their life to the party are wondering whether it
actually is in terminal decline&#8217;. <a href="#n102" name="f102">[102]</a></p>

<p>When Smith was elected in 1992, Livingstone wrote: &#8216;The triumph
of the right is now complete. They control every lever of power in
the party&#8217;, <a href="#n103" name="f103">[103]</a> while the
election of Tony Blair topped even this as &#8216;the most extreme right
wing leader&#8217; the Party ever had. <a href="#n104" name="f104">[104]</a>
Hain described power as &#8216;centralised to an unprecedented extent&#8217;.
<a href="#n105" name="f105">[105]</a> Finally, in 1993 Clare Short
predicted: &#8216;We have two years at most to flush out the modernisers
... If we do not achieve this, then the electorate will have a choice
between the new Labour SDP and the Liberal Democrat&#8217;s, with little
difference between the two. But time is running out and the prospects
do not look good.&#8217; <a href="#n106" name="f106">[106]</a></p>

<p>Yet tied to reformism, for the Labour left hope springs eternal.
In 1994 &#8216;the best Labour Conference for some years&#8217; was held,
according to Livingstone. <a href="#n107" name="f107">[107]</a> (This
was the one preceding abolition of Clause 4.) Although the left are a
beleaguered minority on the NEC &#8216;the votes for the left candidates
increased&#8217;. <a href="#n108" name="f108">[108]</a> Hain says the
challenge to Clause 4, &#8216;has clearly put the cat among the
ideological pigeons and, not before time, injected new vigour into
the debate about the nature of socialism ... This should be
welcomed.&#8217; The left should be &#8216;engaged constructively with
Blair&#8217;. <a href="#n109" name="f109">[109]</a> Hain&#8217;s &#8216;engagement&#8217;
took the form of a book which starts with the libertarian tradition
dating back through Kropotkin, the Russian anarchist, to the Diggers
and Levellers, and ends saying &#8216;Governments have to save capitalism
from itself.&#8217; <a href="#n110" name="f110">[110]</a> Thus, Labour
&#8216;will need the backing of the unions, especially when carrying
through economic policies which require a switch from consumption to
investment and from real wage increases to job creation&#8217;. <a href="#n111" name="f111">[111]</a>
Short, her two year deadline of flushing out modernisers due, writes;
&#8216;Tony Blair has a remarkable ability ... Anyone who indulges in
split and public rows ... should never be forgiven ... We now have a
duty that all of us must rise to. Blair cannot do it without us and
we cannot do it without him.&#8217; <a href="#n112" name="f112">[112]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The evolution of Labour policies</h4>

<p class="fst">We have already shown that Thatcher failed to win the ideological
argument by 1987. <a href="#n113" name="f113">[113]</a> Since then,
far from the trend of public opinion following the Labour leadership
to the right, it has been clearly in the opposite direction, as the

<p class="fst">The 1992 election study concludes: &#8216;There has been a
considerable amount of evidence in recent years suggesting that,
rather than being converted to the tenets of Thatcherism, many of the
electorate have actually been moving to the left.&#8217; The issues
included unemployment, nuclear weapons and privatisation where &#8216;there
were modest but statistically significant moves to the left.&#8217; <a href="#n115" name="f115">[115]</a></p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s policies have gone from being based on genuine
reformist principles (such as unilateralism, universal welfare),
through Kinnock&#8217;s Policy Review to consciously occupying right wing
Tory territory. Below are a few examples. As far as possible we let
Labour speak for itself:<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Unilateral disarmament</em></p>

<p class="fst">In 1988 we noted Kinnock making &#8216;a move to multi-lateral nuclear
disarmament.&#8217; <a href="#n116" name="f116">[116]</a> Now Labour
appears to have abandoned disarmament altogether. Financial prudence
is demanded for social spending, but the &#163;22 billion Trident project
is not questioned:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We stand four-square by the notion that, whatever is
required to defend Britain, Labour will provide ... Obviously it
doesn&#8217;t make sense for us to give up a capability that we are
unique in NATO in providing ... I would not scrap [Trident, though]
it is difficult to argue out a particular role for [it]. We just need
it there as a standing reminder. <a href="#n117" name="f117">[117]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Blair complains the Tories spend too little on arms. &#8216;It would
be an abdication of Labour&#8217;s duty if we did not point out that
these cuts will weaken Britain&#8217;s operational capabilities.&#8217; <a href="#n118" name="f118">[118]</a></p>

<p>Along with this goes a disgusting nationalism. Straw is
&#8216;reclaiming the flag&#8217; from &#8216;the grotesque caricature of England
that is the National Front.&#8217; How? &#8216;English patriotism has for too
long been corralled. We should stop apologising for being English.
Feeling pride in one&#8217;s country should not make one into a jingo.&#8217;
The Union Jack flew over the first concentration camps, over the
slave ships and the violent conquests of the largest Empire in world
history. <a href="#n119" name="f119">[119]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Education</em></p>

<p class="fst">In 1991 Labour condemned Tory policies of selection, testing and
school opt outs as fostering:</p>

<p class="quoteb">a privatised divided education system, in which a few get
the cash, while for the rest it is second best. The Tories are
creating a system so offensive to the values of justice and fairness
that they have been condemned by the heads of both the Anglican and
Catholic churches. <a href="#n120" name="f120">[120]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Blair seeks to change these labour opinions. The &#8216;old&#8217; (1991)
Labour attitude to education, he said, &#8216;typifies the reasons why
the left has been losing general elections for the last 16 years
instead of winning them.&#8217; <a href="#n121" name="f121">[121]</a> In
December 1994 Blair, who sets so much store by the local community,
applied to send his son eight miles to London Oratory, a non-union
opt out school, headed by a former advisor to the Tory Education
Minister, which has been criticised by the Catholic education service
for its over rigorous selection of pupils. <a href="#n122" name="f122">[122]</a>
Blair was &#8216;aghast&#8217; when he discovered Labour&#8217;s General
Secretary relaxed about sending his children to a local school: &#8216;The
Blairs were apparently asking [him] the sort of incredulous questions
about life in an inner city &#8220;comp&#8221; that used to face nineteenth
century explorers when they came back from overseas with tales of the
strange things that the natives did in the jungle.&#8217; <a href="#n123" name="f123">[123]</a></p>

<p>To cover the Blair family&#8217;s tracks Labour&#8217;s Diversity and
Excellence document invented &#8216;foundation schools&#8217; (opt out
schools by another name) operating with &#8216;a fair admissions policy&#8217;.
<a href="#n124" name="f124">[124]</a> &#8216;On tests one MP declares:
&#8216;It&#8217;s not good enough to bang on about socio-economic background
... By measuring outcomes we can define which schools are performing
well and which are performing badly.&#8217; <a href="#n125" name="f125">[125]</a>
With this in mind Blunkett encouraged the NUT to abandon opposition
to tests and league tables because &#8216;a Labour government would keep
the tests and continue to publish results&#8217;. <a href="#n126" name="f126">[126]</a></p>

<p>Roy Hattersley, hardly a man of the Labour left, concludes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Labour Party will, in effect, repudiate the principle
of comprehensive education [and] cannibalise one of the most
discredited policies of the Government ... The grant maintained idea
is one of the Government&#8217;s major policy failures. Despite
escalating bribes, less than one school in 20 has chosen to leave the
maintained system. Yet Labour has chosen to breath life into the
corpse. <a href="#n127" name="f127">[127]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Even in opposition these policy somersaults have a direct impact.
When, in 1995, almost half the secondary school governors were
considering whether to set illegal budgets Labour rushed to oppose
this. By 1996 the Tories planned to expand selection by schools
because Labour had taken over so many other Tory education policies
like closing failing schools. <a href="#n128" name="f128">[128]</a>
Two weeks later Harriet Harman sent her child to one of the most
selective schools in the country.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Law and order</em></p>

<p class="fst">Since 1988 there have been numerous revelations about miscarriages
of justice &#8211; the Guildford Four, Maguire family, Birmingham Six,
Broadwater Farm Three, SAS executions in Gibraltar the murder of Joy
Gardner and more. Police largely stood by as racist attacks doubled
between 1989 and 1994. Labour should have lambasted the Tories,
pointing out the social deterioration behind the crime figures.</p>

<p>Yet Blair made his reputation outflanking the Tories right. &#8216;The
Tories have given up on crime&#8217; <a href="#n129" name="f129">[129]</a>
he argued and went on &#8216;Labour is the Party of law and order in
Britain today&#8217;. He added: &#8216;We need to be tough on crime and tough
on the causes of crime.&#8217; <a href="#n130" name="f130">[130]</a>
While the first phrase obviously is the Tory agenda, the second
appears to criticise a society where, it has been clearly
demonstrated, increases in unemployment lead to rising crime rates.</p>

<p>But Blair meant something else. He was stealing Major&#8217;s &#8216;back
to basic&#8217; campaign. Blair&#8217;s &#8216;causes of crime&#8217; were &#8216;our
disintegration as a community, with standards to sustain a community.
<a href="#n131" name="f131">[131]</a> According to Blair this was not
caused by mass unemployment or a slashed welfare state, but a failure
to &#8216;demand responsibilities&#8217;. <a href="#n132" name="f132">[132]</a>
His &#8216;cure&#8217; &#8211; stop and search powers to the police, prosecuting
parents for truanting children, custodial sentences for youngsters
and condemning single parents because &#8216;it is best for kids to be
brought up in a normal, stable family.&#8217; When Major said, &#8217;we
should forgive a little less&#8217; Blair told the police, We do not
excuse and we do not ignore ... speak the language of punishment.&#8217;
<a href="#n133" name="f133">[133]</a></p>

<p>What did the Tories make of this? Chris Patten, former
Conservative Chairman, said: &#8216;I find myself in complete agreement
with somebody like Tony Blair&#8217;. <a href="#n134" name="f134">[134]</a>
Norman Tebbit added: &#8216;you have to approach from a direction which
some might say is almost Labour Party direction.&#8217; <a href="#n135" name="f135">[135]</a></p>

<p>As with education, Labour&#8217;s right wing policy statements allowed
the Tories to move much further than they had dared before. The
Criminal Justice Bill was &#8216;designed to be so unpalatable to Labour
that it would force Blair to oppose the Bill at the very time he was
trying to convince people that Labour was now tougher on law and
order than the Conservatives. <a href="#n136" name="f136">[136]</a>
This Bill, said the <strong>Observer</strong>, &#8216;will cause more miscarriages
of justice, the jailing of harmless demonstrators and, in tenser
parts of the country, the transformation of the police into something
like an occupying army.&#8217; <a href="#n137" name="f137">[137]</a> Save
the Children Fund said that jailing young children contravened the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Michael Mansfield, QC, warned:
&#8216;The police are to be given another weapon with which
metaphorically to beat even more confessions out of people.&#8217; <a href="#n138" name="f138">[138]</a>
Labour quibbled over parts of the Bill and then abstained.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s Frank Field called for identity cards and &#8216;a core SAS
style anti-fraud officers&#8217;. <a href="#n139" name="f139">[139]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>The National Health Service</em></p>

<p class="fst">In 1991 Kinnock slammed Tory health policies:</p>
<p class="quoteb">Their hospital opt outs will create, and are intended to
create, a health service consisting of trading units. Their GP
contract system will create and is intended to create, a market place
of haggling doctors &#8216;buying and selling patients&#8217; ... This
process is called privatisation. At the next election the British
people will be deciding whether they keep the National Health Service
... Those who vote Labour will be voting to build up the NHS. <a href="#n140" name="f140">[140]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In future there will be no such choice. The Tories have closed one
third of beds since 1979 and one in eight hospitals <a href="#n141" name="f141">[141]</a>,
but in 1995 Blunkett said there were &#8216;too many beds&#8217;. Launching
<strong>Renewing the NHS</strong> Blair added, &#8216;We are not reversing all the
Conservative reforms&#8217;. Labour will merely &#8216;discourage the
signing&#8217; of long term contracts for private run hospitals. The
&#8216;buying and selling&#8217; purchaser-provider split at the core of
marketisation is virtually retained and there is &#8216;no absolute
commitment&#8217; to abolish GP fundholding, merely a plan to phase it
out. <a href="#n142" name="f142">[142]</a> Patricia Hewitt, Blair&#8217;s adviser, was a member of the
Healthcare 2000 committee whose report favours ending the universal
health service free at the point of delivery. <a href="#n143" name="f143">[143]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Poverty and the Welfare State</em></p>

<p class="fst">In 1990 Michael Meacher criticised Thatcher&#8217;s claim that &#8216;all
people on all incomes have increased their standard of living&#8217;:
&#8216;Tell that to the 150,000 homeless people in London and the
beggars.&#8217; <a href="#n144" name="f144">[144]</a> He continued that
with the &#8216;scrounger myth [the Tories] hope to turn attention away
from the fact that benefit levels themselves have hit an all time
low.&#8217; <a href="#n145" name="f145">[145]</a> Between 1979 and 1992
the real income of the wealthiest 10 percent (including housing
costs) rose 62 percent. The poorest 10 percent saw an 18 percent
fall. <a href="#n146" name="f146">[146]</a> A 1995 report showed
wealth inequality in Britain to be the second worst among the
developed countries. Only New Zealand was worse.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s response? A Commission for Social Justice headed by Sir
Gordon Borrie, QC, who said: &#8216;I have a substantial house in the
country and a rented flat in the Temple. I belong to a couple of
clubs where the subscriptions are quite high and have enjoyed a high
public salary.&#8217; <a href="#n147" name="f147">[147]</a> He cited his
qualification for the Commission as &#8216;being uncommitted to either
side of the universality or means testing debate.&#8217; Others on the
Commission included two founders of the SDP and Liberal Democrat
advisers. <a href="#n148" name="f148">[148]</a> The results of the
Commission have been described in the following terms:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The extent of the common ground between the Tory left and
&#8216;New Labour&#8217; is remarkable. The Commission argues that people
should be able to use the money spent on their benefits as a subsidy
with which to attract potential employers; the government is already
running a pilot scheme. The Commission urges that unemployment
benefit, income support and family credit be reformed to encourage
part time work and to encourage people off welfare into work; the
Chancellor has already signalled that this will be a key theme in
next month&#8217;s budget. And the Commission argues that the married
couple&#8217;s tax allowance and mortgage interest tax relief should be
phased out gradually; this is already happening. <a href="#n149" name="f149">[149]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Labour has dropped its 1992 pledge to restore income support to
16&#8211;17-year-olds. With the Party adopting US workfare schemes these
250,000 young unemployed would no longer be entitled to full benefits
but earn them. <a href="#n150" name="f150">[150]</a> This threat has
been extended, with plans to cut 40 percent of benefit from other
&#8216;work-shy&#8217; young people. <a href="#n151" name="f151">[151]</a></p>

<p>Major caused outrage saying beggars were &#8216;an eye-sore which must
be swept from the streets&#8217;. <a href="#n152" name="f152">[152]</a>
So Straw followed: &#8216;Aggressive begging, along with graffiti&#8217; and,
in some cities &#8216;squeegee merchants&#8217; are responsible for
&#8216;intimidation and bullying on the streets.&#8217; <a href="#n153" name="f153">[153]</a>
This earned him the nickname &#8216;Jackboots Straw&#8217; at the 1995 TUC
where an FBU delegate declared &#8216;I&#8217;m not saying Straw is a fascist
&#8211; yet &#8211; but he is heading down a road with very dangerous
company.&#8217; <a href="#n154" name="f154">[154]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Minimum wage</em></p>

<p class="fst">This is &#8216;one of the few distinctive policies&#8217; Labour has, says
the <strong>Financial Times</strong>. <a href="#n155" name="f155">[155]</a> The
1992 manifesto pledged a rate of half median male earnings, at that
time &#163;3.40. Today the figure is nearer &#163;4.15. By 1995 Blair would
not set a rate until &#8216;after the election&#8217; <a href="#n156" name="f156">[156]</a>
to be calculated by a committee including businessmen, on the basis
of &#8216;economic ... as well as social justice considerations.&#8217; <a href="#n157" name="f157">[157]</a>
Bill Morris of the Transport and General Workers&#8217; Union has likened
the involvement of businessmen in setting the minimum wage to
&#8216;putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank.&#8217; Harriet Harman has
subsequently promised the CBI that 18&#8211;24 year olds would get a
lower rate minimum wage and &#8216;very young ; workers&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t be
covered at all. <a href="#n158" name="f158">[158]</a> <br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Full employment</em></p>

<p class="fst">Although full employment was destroyed under Labour, it was
axiomatic that this was its policy. Then Kinnock&#8217;s review document
<strong>Opportunity Britain</strong> made it &#8216;an objective&#8217;. By 1993 Gordon
Brown was going &#8216;beyond traditional notions of full employment. In
the new world our aspiration must be full and fulfilling employment
through work and training&#8217;. What the party has in mind is to
&#8216;Replace redundancy with the prospect of new work through
training.&#8217; <a href="#n159" name="f159">[159]</a> Blair puts &#8216;the
notion of full employment within a bigger notion, that of a cohesive
and united society.&#8217; &#8216;Focus on the quality of the jobs created&#8217;,
he pleads. <a href="#n160" name="f160">[160]</a> What a disgraceful
end to a policy.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Taxation</em></p>

<p class="fst">Reformism has always sought to redistribute crumbs from the
capitalist table. In 1990 Labour had changed, but Smith, no left
winger, still told Conference:</p>

<p class="quoteb">we do insist that the minority who received an enormous
bounty from Mrs Thatcher should pay their fair share. [<em>Applause</em>]
[And] because of the vital importance of our public services we
cannot promise cuts in income tax ... or cut back on education and
training, on research, [on] our health service. <a href="#n161" name="f161">[161]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1993 the richest 10 percent of the population paid 34 percent
of income in taxes, the bottom 10 percent paid 46 percent. <a href="#n162" name="f162">[162]</a>
The share of national output taken by tax puts the UK low down at
17th out of 24 major economies according to the OECD.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s 1992 manifesto called for top rate tax at 59 percent.
The following year this was dropped. &#8216;Labour is not against wealth,
nor will we seek to penalise it,&#8217; said Brown. As for public
spending commitments &#8211; &#8217;There are none&#8217;. <a href="#n163" name="f163">[163]</a>Blair
feels &#8216;there are top rate tax payers now who are hardly in the
super rich bracket and I think we&#8217;ve got to be extremely sensitive
to them.&#8217; <a href="#n164" name="f164">[164]</a> In his <strong>News of
the World</strong> column Blair wrote: &#8216;if someone goes on to be
wealthy, then good luck to them&#8217;. He went on to commiserate with
&#8216;Middle England&#8217; who &#8216;have suffered the real burden of tax
increases.&#8217; <a href="#n165" name="f165">[165]</a> Labour outflanked
Tory income tax cuts in the November 1995 budget. Unlike them
Labour&#8217;s tax cuts &#8216;would apply to all taxpayers.&#8217; <a href="#n166" name="f166">[166]</a>
A lower starting rate for income tax was Brown&#8217;s &#8216;main ingredient
in efforts to cut welfare costs and persuade claimants to take low
paid jobs.&#8217; <a href="#n167" name="f167">[167]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Labour&#8217;s economic strategy</em></p>

<p class="fst">Since Dennis Healey in the 1970s ended Keynesian policies and set
the scene for Thatcherism, the overlap between Tory and Labour
strategies has been extraordinary:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In the run up to the 1992 election, the Tories forecast a
PSBR [Public Sector Borrowing Requirement] of &#163;28,000 million. We
said that, by an amazing coincidence, that was exactly the PSBR we
would have as well ... <a href="#n168" name="f168">[168]</a> Well,
said the Tories after the election, it might have to be a bit higher
&#8211; perhaps &#163;37,000 million. That&#8217;s exactly the figure we have
arrived at too, we said ... Hang on a minute, said the Tories, it
will have to rise to perhaps &#163;50,000 million. Just what we thought,
we said. <a href="#n169" name="f169">[169]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Is this really the voice of an effective opposition?</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s only disagreement with the Tories (or rather one wing
of the Tories) was &#8216;Labour&#8217;s total endorsement of European
monetary union, the exchange rate mechanism [ERM] and the concept of
a single central bank.&#8217; Alas, &#8216;they were being more Thatcherite
than the Thatcherites.&#8217; It was a &#8216;me too, only more so&#8217;
approach. <a href="#n170" name="f170">[170]</a> Labour got its
fingers burnt when the pound crashed out of the ERM in September 1992.</p>

<p>Since then it has been so cautious that Ken Clarke, Tory
Chancellor mused: &#8216;I must be the first Chancellor who has a shadow
chancellor who is not criticising what I am doing. Gordon Brown&#8217;s
problem is he thinks what I am doing is working. He has not, for some
time, opposed anything I have done.&#8217; <a href="#n171" name="f171">[171]</a> What
could Brown say? &#8216;If the Tories take on our agenda, it&#8217;s a
recognition that the political argument is moving in our direction.&#8217;
And what is that direction? (Readers might like to swap the words
&#8216;Conservative&#8217; and &#8216;Labour&#8217; in the next Brown quote. The
result is a typical speech used by Tory politicians against Labour
for the last 90 years.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Labour will be tougher on the causes of inflation than
the Conservatives ... And it&#8217;s right that we should be tough. The
war against inflation is a Labour war. It affects pensions and those
with savings, it damages investment and therefore jobs. <a href="#n172" name="f172">[172]</a></p>

<p class="fst">So Labour refuses to solve the poverty, homelessness and welfare
cuts the Tories have created either through taxing the rich, or by borrowing.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Tory anti union laws</em></p>

<p class="fst">While Blair praises the insight of Thatcher&#8217;s ideology, as one
writer puts it: &#8216;none of this ramshackle ragbag of half-cock
theories and accidental wheezes, could possibly have &#8220;seen off
socialism&#8221; on their own ... we may be getting closer to the true
murder weapon when we turn to Lady Thatcher&#8217;s onslaught on the
trade unions.&#8217; <a href="#n173" name="f173">[173]</a> The anti union
laws have been flouted on many occasions, but they remain
simultaneously a shackle and an alibi the inaction of union leaders.
Even Blair once recognised that restriction of &#8216;secondary&#8217; (i.e.
solidarity) action was &#8216;a draconian limitation on effective
industrial action.&#8217; <a href="#n174" name="f174">[174]</a> Prescott
expressed the general viewpoint in 1989: &#8216;It all has to go.&#8217; <a href="#n175" name="f175">[175]</a></p>

<p>What is the situation today? The 1995 TUC Conference defeated a
motion for repeal of &#8216;all anti trade union laws&#8217;. Blair told the
TUC: &#8216;We are not going back to the old battles. I will say now that
there&#8217;s going to be no repeal of all Tory union laws ... Ballots
before strikes are here to stay. No mass or flying pickets. All those
ghosts of times past, they are exorcised.&#8217; <a href="#n176" name="f176">[176]</a>
When the Tories, following Blair&#8217;s &#8216;stakeholder&#8217; speech,
wondered if it meant more union power. Brown rushed to deny Labour
would &#8216;extend union rights&#8217; beyond the minimal ones in the
European Social Chapter. A perplexed commentator concluded that
&#8216;Labour would prefer to upset the unions rather than the CBI.&#8217;
<a href="#n177" name="f177">[177]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Racism, immigration and asylum</em></p>

<p class="fst">The unpopularity of the Tory government means that whipping up
racism to try and win votes is an option they seriously entertain.
Yet Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw asserts that &#8216;it should not be
possible to insert a cigarette paper between the government and the
Labour front benches over immigration&#8217;. <a href="#n178" name="f178">[178]</a>
The Labour left&#8217;s response to rising racism, attacks and murders
was to support an organisation called the Anti Racist Alliance (ARA).
Much time was spent denouncing the other much larger anti racist
organisation, the Anti Nazi League, as an SWP front. The election of
a BNP councillor in Tower Hamlets in September 1993 raised the
profile of racism and racists everywhere. The turning point in their
fortunes of the Nazis came on 16 October 1993 when 60,000
demonstrators marched on the BNP&#8217;s headquarters in Welling, south
east London. That day ARA also held a demonstration, many miles away
in Trafalgar Square, attended by 2,000 people and Labour&#8217;s high
dignitaries. Not long afterwards ARA imploded in disarray.</p>

<p>The Tory government has now turned its attacks on to refugees. As
we write it is introducing a spiteful Bill which will undoubtedly
prevent many escaping death from murderous regimes abroad. The
furthest Labour has dared go is to suggest, respectfully, that a
Committee be appointed to look into the question. When the Tories
decided to deport a Saudi Arabian democrat who sought asylum, in
order that the government could secure lucrative arms contracts with
the Saudis. Jack Straw was asked if he would have done the same
thing. He answered: &#8216;That&#8217;s not a decision which I can take&#8217;.
On the moral question of deportation to win arms sales. Straw
commented, &#8216;You&#8217;ve obviously got to take account of that
consideration in the world in which we live.&#8217; <a href="#n179" name="f179">[179]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Tony Blair and Labour</h4>

<p class="fst">This book began with a quote from Lenin noting that workers
support Labour but it is &#8216;led by reactionaries and the worst kind
of reactionaries at that, who are quite in the spirit of the
bourgeoisie.&#8217; <a href="#n180" name="f180">[180]</a> Blair is the
purest expression of this. No other leader matches his career: son of
a Tory councillor, educated at Edinburgh&#8217;s premier public school,
then Oxford; first links with top Labour echelons made as legal
adviser for witch hunting Militant; becomes &#8216;leadership material&#8217;
when he dumps the closed shop; becomes publicly known when calling
for children to be jailed; first act as Labour leader &#8211; abolition
of Clause 4.</p>

<p>Commentators of all types agree that there is something
incongruous about Blair heading a movement composed largely of
working class people. John Sopel writes: &#8216;As he stands before an
audience of Labour activists and union fixers, the pre-eminent
feeling is that he is not one of them.&#8217; <a href="#n181" name="f181">[181]</a>
Lawson says: &#8216;I was always slightly surprised that he was in the
Labour Party at all. He is quite definitely the least socialist
leader the Labour Party has ever had.&#8217; <a href="#n182" name="f182">[182]</a>
Ken Coates, Labour MEP feels Blair &#8216;does not begin to understand
the mentality of the party which he has been elected to lead.&#8217;
<a href="#n183" name="f183">[183]</a> According to Rentoul his
modernising trend &#8216;did not arise from a social movement outside the
party, or from the grass roots or the unions within it. It was
synthesised by the Parliamentary leadership.&#8217; <a href="#n184" name="f184">[184]</a>
So Blair doesn&#8217;t fit, yet he is perfectly appropriate in a
&#8216;capitalist workers&#8217; party&#8217;.</p>

<p>Blair has many admirers. Thatcher is one: &#8216;He is probably the
most formidable leader ... since Hugh Gaitskell. I [do not] see a lot
of socialism in Mr Blair&#8217;. <a href="#n185" name="f185">[185]</a> To
the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>&#8217;<em>s</em> editor he is a &#8216;proper Tory
Prime Minister in waiting.&#8217; <a href="#n186" name="f186">[186]</a>
Alan Clark, far right ex-Minister, says &#8216;virtually single handed
[Blair] has transformed the Labour Party into a credible political
party.&#8217; <a href="#n187" name="f187">[187]</a> The <strong>Sunday Times</strong>&#8217;
Martin Jacques praises his &#8216;deep hostility towards labourism &#8211;
towards the culture of class&#8217;. <a href="#n188" name="f188">[188]</a>
The <strong>Economist</strong> appreciates this &#8216;presidential style
candidate: nice man, nice wife, nice kids, good on telly&#8217;. <a href="#n189" name="f189">[189]</a>
It added that &#8216;Scrapping Clause 4 is the start ... but what a good
start.&#8217; <a href="#n190" name="f190">[190]</a> Murdoch &#8216;could even
imagine supporting&#8217; him and Roy Jenkins thinks he is &#8216;the best
hope for social democracy&#8217;. <a href="#n191" name="f191">[191]</a></p>

<p>Blair is a great admirer of US President Bill Clinton, whose
disastrous administration has nourished the rabid right of Newt
Gingrich&#8217;s Republicans. Clinton stood as a &#8216;New Democrat&#8217;,
Blair as &#8216;New Labour&#8217;. Clinton appealed to &#8216;the forgotten
middle class, who work hard and play by the rules&#8217;, Blair appeals
to &#8216;middle income Britain, who work hard and do well.&#8217; <a href="#n192" name="f192">[192]</a>
Clinton would &#8216;offer more opportunity to all and demand more
responsibility for all.&#8217; <a href="#n193" name="f193">[193]</a>
Blair: &#8216;We give opportunity, we demand responsibility.&#8217; <a href="#n194" name="f194">[194]</a>
But if Blair was &#8216;Clinton with his flies done up&#8217; <a href="#n195" name="f195">[195]</a>,
he has now learned from the American&#8217;s failures. An <strong>Independent</strong>
editorial entitled <em>Tony Blair&#8217;s Newt Labour</em> concludes &#8216;he
has anticipated many of the popular themes that have characterised
the recent success of Newt Gingrich and the US Republicans, and is
now seeking to capture them.&#8217; <a href="#n196" name="f196">[196]</a></p>

<p>Blair&#8217;s other idol is Thatcher who, his &#8216;Chief of Staff&#8217;
confirms, &#8216;is his model. And she once said that her single greatest
success was the change she had brought about in the Labour Party.
That&#8217;s also Tony Blair&#8217;s job &#8211; in reverse, of course.&#8217; <a href="#n197" name="f197">[197]</a>
Blair says &#8216;The new right had struck a chord. There was a
perception that there was too much collective power [union influence
&#8211; <em>TC/DG</em>], too much state intervention and too many vested
interests&#8217; [unions, again!] <a href="#n198" name="f198">[198]</a>
&#8216;I believe Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s emphasis on enterprise was right. She
was thoroughly determined and that is admirable.&#8217; <a href="#n199" name="f199">[199]</a>
He is nostalgic about &#8216;the Thatcher administration [which had] a
very strong sense of what they wanted to do with the country and
that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got to communicate.&#8217; But isn&#8217;t Labour left
wing and the Tories right wing? &#8216;The terms left and right have
become, in many ways, meaningless within the Labour Party.&#8217; <a href="#n200" name="f200">[200]</a>
New Labour&#8217;s objectives &#8216;should and will cross the old boundaries
between left and right, progressive and conservative.&#8217; <a href="#n201" name="f201">[201]</a></p>

<p>Obviously Blair&#8217;s popularity is not confined to the right. After
all the Labour Party elected him over Margaret Beckett and John
Prescott in July 1994. But caution needs to be exercised here. Though
Blair campaigned with the entire press behind him, his share of the
vote &#8211; 57 percent &#8211; was not remarkable, especially compared with
his predecessor&#8217;s 91 percent. The comparative distribution of
Blair&#8217;s votes was notable &#8211; 61 percent of MPs, 58 percent from
the constituencies, just 52 percent from the trade unionists. <a href="#n202" name="f202">[202]</a></p>

<p>There have been periodic murmurings against Blair. For example,
Richard Burden, MP, not noted as hard left, protested at Labour&#8217;s
Littleborough by-election leaflet which said: &#8216;The choice is
therefore between the Liberal Democrat and his views on drugs and
hefty tax increases and Labour&#8217;s local candidate ... raised here in
the Pennines and committed to Tony Blair&#8217;s New Labour.&#8217; Burden
condemned such &#8216;political amorality in which anything goes.&#8217;
Labour was &#8216;a ruthlessly effective electoral machine ... rather
than a radical party with a definable ideological base ... with
immense pressure on everyone to fall into line in the interests of
unity and not jeopardising electoral chances.&#8217; <a href="#n203" name="f203">[203]</a>
Blair had to fight hard to avoid commitment to a specific minimum
wage rate. Jack Dromey, Blairite challenger to Bill Morris in the T&amp;G
leadership election was defeated and Blair had to tell the T&amp;G
conference that they would not have &#8216;an armlock on Labour or its
policies.&#8217; For his part, Morris warned that unions would not accept
&#8216;a minority relationship&#8217; with Labour. <a href="#n204" name="f204">[204]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to under estimate the &#8216;Blair
effect&#8217;. This was reflected in the row over Clause 4.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Back to the pre 1918 era?</h4>

<p class="fst">Though adopted to head off revolution <a href="#n205" name="f205">[205]</a>,
Clause 4 also represented a break with the Liberal Party. In 1995 it
symbolised what remained in Labour of the idea of socialism. Of
course, the Party had largely ignored Clause 4 and by 1995 had
dropped commitments to renationalise any industry. Ambiguous about
the railways, the only firm nationalisation target is private prisons
&#8216;when their contracts expire&#8217;. <a href="#n206" name="f206">[206]</a>
Since contracts last up to 25 years this might take some time.</p>

<p>Blair wanted new Labour &#8216;liberated from our history&#8217;,
replacing socialism with &#8216;social-ism&#8217;. Clause 4 represented &#8216;a
party born out of the trade unions and formed largely to represent
people at work&#8217;. Blair insisted this was &#8216;too narrow ... I want
Labour to be a party which has in its membership the self employed
and the unemployed, small business people and their customers,
managers and workers.&#8217; <a href="#n207" name="f207">[207]</a> Blair
summarised his alternative in these terms: &#8216;Social-ism ... is not
about class or trade unions, or capitalism versus socialism. It is
about a belief in working together.&#8217; <a href="#n208" name="f208">[208]</a>
One Blairite put the abolition argument more crudely: &#8216;We are
dealing with a romp of people suffering final withdrawal symptoms,
who have not yet come to terms with the fact that we are a social
democratic party.&#8217; <a href="#n209" name="f209">[209]</a></p>

<p>New Labour is in fact very old, pre-1918 Labour. But abolition of
Clause 4 does not simply return the Party to its past. At that time
Labour was led by convinced reformists who feared including socialism
in the constitution because most workers were still wedded to
Liberalism. Today we have the reverse, a leadership which has
abandoned reformism and is attempting to stifle such aspirations in a
working class wedded to reformism. It is true that when in office.
Labour&#8217;s practice has been as right wing as it is now. At such
times it was, in effect, the prisoner of the ruling class. Blair&#8217;s
Labour Party is different. It has moved dramatically to the right in
opposition. Moreover, Labour Prime Ministers tried to excuse their
betrayal of policies by pointing to special circumstances &#8211; the
&#8216;bankers&#8217; ramp&#8217; of 1931,the &#8216;gnomes of Zurich&#8217; in the
1960s, or IMF in the I970s. By contrast Blair revels in following
openly capitalist policies.</p>

<p>So scrapping Clause 4 was not updating the Party image, but an
attempt to ideologically break with reformism. Blair&#8217;s campaign
coincided with Thatcher&#8217;s aim as divulged to the <strong>Sunday Times</strong>
in 1994: &#8216;her ultimate ambition was to destroy a socialist Labour
Party and replace it with a British-style Democratic Party. Britain
would then have two parties committed to the success of capitalism:
the Tories in the anti-state role of the American Republicans,
opposed by a Labour Party backed by the unions but free of left wing
dogma.&#8217; <a href="#n210" name="f210">[210]</a> In terms of ideology
Arthur Scargill&#8217;s comment was deadly accurate: &#8216;Clause 4 is what
marks out the Labour Party from the other major political parties in
Britain. Without Clause 4 the Labour Party is indistinguishable from
the Liberal Democrats and the Tories.&#8217; <a href="#n211" name="f211">[211]</a></p>

<p>Blair&#8217;s new clause promotes: &#8216;A dynamic economy ... in which
the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition are joined
with the forces of partnership and co-operation to produce the wealth
the nation needs.&#8217; <a href="#n212" name="f212">[212]</a> Market
enterprise and rigour mean a world in which 820 million people, 30
percent of humanity, are idle (according to the ILO), in which
children starve in the midst of plenty. It means the untrammelled
power of a tiny minority and their grotesque wealth over the
exploited and oppressed majority. Yet the new clause was adopted at
Labour&#8217;s Special Conference on 29 April 1995 by 65 percent.</p>
<p>A full 90 percent of constituencies were in favour, but only 54.6
percent of the unions. In analysing these results we are beset with
contradictions. The first indications, in a <strong>Tribune</strong> poll of
constituencies, was that 60 out of 62 had decided against scrapping
Clause 4. <a href="#n213" name="f213">[213]</a> These decisions were
made by activists. A typical viewpoint was reported in the
<strong>Independent</strong>: &#8216;Our party leader&#8217;s nickname &#8211; Tory Blair,
is now looking less like a joke.&#8217; <a href="#n214" name="f214">[214]</a>
On the other hand, in the 500 constituencies which had postal
ballots, just 3 voted to retain Clause 4. <a href="#n215" name="f215">[215]</a>
The average vote per constituency was just 200 people, or 47 percent
of the full membership. <a href="#n216" name="f216">[216]</a></p>

<p>The distinction between passivity and activism was shown in
Blair&#8217;s own Sedgefield constituency, where 25 voted for Clause yet
200 turned up to hear Scargill defend it. A survey by Seyd and
Whiteley compared their 1990 findings with 1992 data. The proportion
of members rejecting the idea that &#8216;the production of goods and
services is best left to the free market&#8217; was rising (from 60 to 63
percent), while the number wanting more privatisation was static at
just 2 percent. <a href="#n217" name="f217">[217]</a> A recent survey
of new members published in <strong>Red Pepper</strong> shows the following
ambiguous picture:</p>

<p class="fst">The unions told a similar story. Blair&#8217;s special conference
preceded those of all Labour&#8217;s affiliated unions except USDAW. The
9&#8211;1 pro-abolition ballot in the UCW union was conducted by sending
out forms with the union journal; 83 percent did not vote. A random
sample of 4,000 AEEU members yielded an 11&#8211;1 result. <a href="#n219" name="f219">[219]</a>
The Transport and General, however, had conducted its own
consultative exercise, and at a preliminary meeting only 7 out of 75
delegates backed Blair. Unison cast its 11 percent for Clause 4.
<a href="#n220" name="f220">[220]</a> The press made much of the
difference between unions which used postal ballots and those which
decided at meetings. But what shaped the decisions of each? In the
former, the chief source of information and advice came from the
likes of the Murdoch press. By contrast, union meetings involved
informed discussion.</p>

<p>What of the public? Again the evidence is paradoxical. Opinion
polls are moving against the market and privatisation. When Tory
plans to levy full VAT on fuel were beaten (December 1994)</p>

<p>Labour had an average 32 percent lead. The start of the Clause 4
debate caused this lead to plummet 14 points. <a href="#n221" name="f221">[221]</a>
Blair&#8217;s plan seemed a vote loser. At the same time most people said
their vote would not be influenced by scrapping of Clause 4, though
24 percent (three quarters of them Tories) said they would look on
Labour more favourably. <a href="#n222" name="f222">[222]</a></p>

<p>When newspaper calls for abolishing Clause 4 grew to a frenzy
Blair&#8217;s move gained support (though when it was explained what the
clause meant opinions were less favourable). The eternal refrain was
heard &#8211; Labour must move right to be electable. Left winger Dianne
Abbott described the atmosphere &#8211; Blair&#8217;s new version was &#8216;a
lot of tosh&#8217;, but &#8216;if the leadership asked for a vote on the
healing powers of cabbage it would get it.&#8217; <a href="#n223" name="f223">[223]</a></p>

<p>The Clause 4 issue reveals the contradictions of Blairism. Other
events pointed the same way &#8211; the poor showing of some modernisers
in NEC and Shadow Cabinet elections, and the disgust at Blair and
Harman flouting education policy. Both Blair&#8217;s biographers pinpoint
the phenomenon in the same terms. Rentoul writes: &#8216;Many Labour
Party members voted for him because they thought he could win, not
because they believed in what he was doing.&#8217; <a href="#n224" name="f224">[224]</a>
Sopel agrees: &#8216;There was a schizophrenia in the mind of many Labour
activists that while they voted for Blair because they knew he stood
a better chance than anyone else of winning the next election for
Labour, they didn&#8217;t actually like his approach to policy.&#8217; <a href="#n225" name="f225">[225]</a>
Even Blair&#8217;s inner circle recognises that new Labour &#8216;is not yet
a cohesive integrated political party sharing the same political
ideology.&#8217; <a href="#n226" name="f226">[226]</a> A GMB delegate to
the 1995 TUC put the situation very clearly:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I know it sounds silly, but I often voted against the way
I felt because I do believe there is a bigger issue of having to get
a Labour government. I&#8217;m not sure about standing up to Blair. You
may think I am a coward, but I can tell you I&#8217;m boiling angry at
what this government has done. I&#8217;ll support anyone who does fight.
I&#8217;m itching to get Labour into Downing Street so we can begin
piling on the pressure for more change than Blair is proposing. <a href="#n227" name="f227">[227]</a></p>

<p class="fst">What is happening? Firstly, there is intense hatred from vast
sections of the population for the Tories&#8217; policies. This, above
all, has given Labour consistent poll leads, in spite of Blair
adopting these self same Tory policies. But, if &#8216;New Labour&#8217; is
riding high in the polls then this apparently confirms Blair&#8217;s
indispensability. But 1992 was a warning. Blair may be grabbing
disillusioned Tory voters while Labour supporters have no electoral
alternative. Yet this is a short term, high risk strategy. If the
Tories can appear to overcome their worst problems, then Tory voters
will return to their natural home in droves. Blair treats his own
party in such a cavalier fashion that it may provoke splits. But even
if the party stays united until the election frustration is likely to
explode afterwards.</p>

<p>This raises a second issue. If, as we have argued, Labour reflects
the conflicting pressures of the ruling class and working class, and
if there has been a modest revival in working class confidence and
ideological shift to the left, then why does Labour not reflect this?
The counter pressure of capitalism has also grown. Thatcher&#8217;s
direct offensive had to be abandoned after the poll tax but the
ideological offensive was given added weight by the &#8216;fall of
Communism&#8217;. In previous times the Labour leadership attempted to
balance the interests of workers and the system. Now this seems an
even more impossible task because of the void separating simple
reformist demands (for a job, decent pay and conditions, and basic
public services) and the system&#8217;s insistence on higher exploitation
and cost cutting at all levels.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Labour&#8217;s structures, sclerotic at the best of times,
are now even less responsive to working class pressure due to weaker
union links and an anaesthetised membership. The ideological gulf
between the Party leadership and the day to day experience of
supporters is much wider. Although not a fully representative sample,
compare Blair&#8217;s vision of New Labour (&#8216;one nationism&#8217;, tilted
as much towards small business and managers as workers) with
candidates for the various parties in 1992 (see table below).</p>

<p class="fst">Unlike the other two parties, 356 of Labour&#8217;s candidates were
union sponsored. It is such facts which explain why, in spite of any
number of prawn cocktail offensive, &#163;500-a-head banquets and
pro-business lunches, Labour remains the second eleven team for
British capitalism.</p>

<p>Thus despite all the changes since 1988 labour is still regarded
as a working class party (despite its record). In March 1995 the
Tories reached a record low point in the polls. When MORI asked if
Labour would &#8216;help to improve your standard of living?&#8217; those in
the poorest social groupings, C2s and D/E answered positively,
scoring +16 points. By contrast groups A/B and Cl were &#8722;23 points
against. Questioned about whether Labour would keep its promises the
working class groupings showed +10, the upper groups polled &#8722;21
points. <a href="#n229" name="f229">[229]</a> These results have
little to do with the reality of the Labour Party, but everything to
do with its perception. At the moment the reality and the perception
do not enter into direct conflict. A small incident showed this will
not always be the case &#8211; the strong reaction in broad Labour
circles to Harman&#8217;s sending of her child to a selective grammar school.</p>

<p>Tension between Blair and the social reality of Labour&#8217;s support
is great, but the bonds of mutual dependence are also strong. Blair
cannot do without the votes of workers or the cash of the unions. On
the other hand, many Labour supporters have been convinced that Blair
alone can win the next election. The strength of such bonds mean
reformist alternatives to Labour face major obstacles.</p>

<p>A similar situation defeated the ILP in the 1930s and Militant in
the early 1990s. In the latter case, Leslie Mahmood&#8217;s candidature
in Eric Heffer&#8217;s old seat of Walton, gained 6.5 percent. This was a
good base for revolutionary policy of intervention in the daily
struggles of the working class. A reformist perspective demanded that
the seat be won, and compared with the right wing Labour candidate&#8217;s
53 percent the result was a disaster.</p>

<p>Announcing the formation of a Socialist Labour Party in early
1996, Scargill has sensed the deep unease felt in broad Labour
circles about Blair. This does not mean there is much room for a
second reformist party in Britain. The SLP did save its deposit at
the Hemsworth by election, but it is clear in this case too that the
first past the post system hampers any challenge to Labour from the
reformist left. Meanwhile, the wish to remove the Tories, shared by
trade unionists from rank and file to bureaucracy, means the unions
are unlikely to support a competitor to this Party.</p>

<p>Many Labour supporters are extremely angry with what the
modernisers have done to Labour policies, but it will take a change
of circumstances to release this anger. This may occur before an
election, but it is certainly likely after the election of a Blair
government when the hopes meet the real New Labour party in head on collision.</p>

<p>Until that time the sharp edge of conflict between New Labour and
the needs and aspirations of workers is to be found on the industrial
scene. Those workers who do not accept a revolutionary alternative to
electoral politics will wait for the election of a Labour government,
even though there is rising anger over the way Blair is behaving on
education, the minimum wage and much more. However, the immediate
problems of the workplace cannot be ignored for that long and here
the battle is joined between a union bureaucracy anxious to do
nothing to rock the boat for Labour, and the needs of ordinary
workers in their day to day defence of jobs, pay and conditions. The
effect of New Labour is seen here at its clearest.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Prospects for a Blair government</h4>

<p class="fst">We can take an educated guess as to the features of such a
government. Labour is in power at local government level across most
of the country. The policy of the &#8216;dented shield&#8217; &#8211; the
Kinnockite strategy of obeying Tory legislation but attempting to
&#8216;protect&#8217; Labour supporters &#8211; meant, by 1990, jailing many
Labour voters for not paying the poll tax. A recent <strong>New Statesman</strong>
article invites us to &#8216;Meet the new model Labour councillor&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Efficiency is his favourite word; his slogan &#8216;quality
services&#8217;. Performance indicators make his day ... He is definitely
middle-class, though class, for him &#8216;isn&#8217;t an issue&#8217; ... What
our councillor will not tolerate is any cosying up to the unions,
whom he refers to as &#8216;special interest groups&#8217;. (He flies into a
rage when union delegates criticise the council at local party
meetings). He freely admits to being more concerned about the council
tax-payer than the council worker. <a href="#n230" name="f230">[230]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1992 50,000 local government jobs disappeared, many in Labour
authorities. In September, Newham Labour council became the first to
use Tory anti union laws against its workers. Other councils
followed. Sefton, with all committees chaired by Labour, took Unison
to the high court for striking. In 1993 Sheffield council extracted a
3 percent wage cut &#8216;to save jobs&#8217;, but still lost 2,000 that
year. In 1995 the same council tried to cut library workers&#8217; pay by
7 percent but was beaten back. Meanwhile, Liverpool&#8217;s &#8216;New
Labour&#8217; council sent scabs against residential workers opposing
wage cuts there.</p>

<p>It is possible that working class discontent such as occurred
around the mines in 1992, may force Labour to take on a more left
wing stance before the next election. An ill defined minimum wage and
&#8216;windfall tax&#8217; on utilities profits may be supplemented by more
radical sounding measures. The ability of Labour to speak left when
it suits should never be underestimated. But even in these
circumstances, would Labour be different in national rather than
local government? Twelve years of Labour rule in Australia have
produced a drop in real wages of 30 percent, along with the most
savage union busting operation in the country&#8217;s history against
building workers. In Spain the government of Felipe Gonzales, the
Blair of his day, produced 20 percent unemployment, the highest in
Europe. Only one third of these unemployed receive state benefits.
New Zealand, where the Labour government embraced the &#8216;rigours of
competition&#8217;, alone outstrips Britain in terms of wealth inequality.</p>

<p>British Labour only announces what policies it has abandoned.
Blair says he has &#8216;the guts, the decency, the honesty to tell it to
people how it really is, to not make promises we can&#8217;t deliver.&#8217;
<a href="#n231" name="f231">[231]</a> We know &#8216;how it really is&#8217;
&#8211; mass unemployment, poverty and decaying services. But Blair&#8217;s
Labour is &#8216;liberated from particular policy prescriptions&#8217; <a href="#n232" name="f232">[232]</a>
and so how he would deal with this reality is left unsaid. Some
papers have drawn their own conclusions. The <strong>Independent</strong>
comments: &#8216;So Blair &#8211; a Labour leader &#8211; seeks to inherit the
radical mantle that Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s Tory successor let drop&#8217;.
<a href="#n233" name="f233">[233]</a> The <strong>Financial Times</strong>
agrees that the next Labour government will be a &#8216;third Tory party&#8217;
offering &#8216;policies any One Nation Tory could support with a strong
heart and a clear conscience.&#8217; <a href="#n234" name="f234">[234]</a></p>

<p>How might Labour relate to the key social groups? Blair told the
TUC: &#8216;We have an obligation to listen, as we do to the employers.
You have the right to persuade, as they do.&#8217; <a href="#n235" name="f235">[235]</a>
He has given a clue as to which he will find most persuasive. Blair&#8217;s
government will encourage &#8216;a true meritocracy&#8217; <a href="#n236" name="f236">[236]</a>
since, &#8216;the country needs entrepreneurs and people who can go out
and make an awful lot of money,&#8217; <a href="#n237" name="f237">[237]</a>
while the rest will face: &#8216;Ever more intense competition, ever more
creative innovations and ever more advanced skills have made
insecurity at work a permanent feature of life.&#8217; <a href="#n238" name="f238">[238]</a></p>

<p>If Blair&#8217;s close ally Peter Mandelson is anything to go by, the
sort of policies that will be followed could include:</p>

<p class="quoteb">coalition with the Lib Dems; ... abolition of universal
child benefit; ... &#8216;workfare&#8217; programmes for the unemployed and
single mothers; ... no-strike deals in the public sector; ... major
emphasis on private pensions ... all schools to be free of local
authority control. <a href="#n239" name="f239">[239]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A favourite theory of Labour lefts like Ken Livingstone is that
rapid disillusionment with a Blair government will lead to a dramatic
swing to the left in the party such as occurred in 1931 and 1979.
However, it is important to notice how short term these swings were.
The longer term effect was quite the opposite &#8211; a major shift to
the right caused by disillusionment and the desire to win back office
at any cost.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Stakeholding</h4>

<p class="fst">By the end of 1995 it seemed Labour and Tories had mimicked each
other to a Parliamentary standstill. The <strong>Economist</strong> was amazed
to witness that &#8216;Blair went so far as to steal the Tories ancient
ace, the patriotic card ... By the end Mr Blair&#8217;s colleagues were
not the only ones who must have been wondering what the Tories had
left to throw at them.&#8217; <a href="#n240" name="f240">[240]</a>
Austin Mitchell, MP, warned that the electorate will be furious to
discover that &#8216;Tory Tweedledum&#8217; has merely been replaced by
&#8216;Labour Tweedledee&#8217;. He adds: &#8216;To come to power with not an
idea in our head on how to face the crisis which will hit us is to
invite disaster.&#8217; <a href="#n241" name="f241">[241]</a></p>

<p>Labour needed an idea of its own and came up with &#8216;stakeholding&#8217;
which Blair set out in Singapore in January 1995. Stakeholding, says
Will Hutton, whose book <strong>The State We&#8217;re In</strong> seems to be the
idea&#8217;s source, puts &#8216;red water&#8217; between Labour and the
Conservatives. <a href="#n242" name="f242">[242]</a> Its redness is
doubtful. Hutton&#8217;s argument is for a modernised Keynesianism which
makes no pretence at being socialist. In his chapter entitled
<em>Stakeholder capitalism</em> Hutton says &#8216;the object is to keep
the merits of private ownership while reshaping the way it works.&#8217;
<a href="#n243" name="f243">[243]</a></p>

<p>In fact, like Labour confronting Keynesianism in 1931, whenever
Labour has been pressed to back the stakeholder theory with detail it
has ran for cover. The CBI asked for assurances that the new slogan
would not strengthen workers&#8217; rights. Labour rushed to agree. The
party had already promised to introduce the European Social Chapter
(including some rights to union recognition) and a minimum wage so
nothing had been added by the stakeholding policy, since &#8216;all the
history shows, if you pass roles and regulations to try and force
someone to change their culture, it doesn&#8217;t work.&#8217; <a href="#n244" name="f244">[244]</a></p>

<p>Blair&#8217;s choice of Singapore as venue was not accidental. He had
come to study a country where &#8216;there are restrictions on individual
rights, the banning of labour organisations, tight controls on the
press and the subordination of citizens rights to internal security.&#8217;
<a href="#n245" name="f245">[245]</a> The political system of the so
called Asian tiger economies has been aptly described as &#8216;Happy
face fascism&#8217;. South Korea, for example, locks up more trade union
leaders than any other country. Blair showed particular interest in
Singapore&#8217;s welfare system which he says &#8216;has certainly done the
job&#8217;. The <strong>Guardian</strong> noted &#8216;the irony of British politicians
coming back to study a savings system first conceived by Singaporean
British colonial rulers [which is] designed to look after the needs
of the workers when they retire in a [society] that offers no social
security benefits or subsidised health service.&#8217; <a href="#n246" name="f246">[246]</a>
The <strong>Economist</strong> thinks &#8216;There is indeed much to be said for
such a system, which amount to abolishing the universal state
pension, but it wonders if &#8216;Mr Blair could convince his party that
scrapping Britain&#8217;s biggest universal benefit was what they meant
by social cohesion and the stakeholding economy.&#8217; <a href="#n247" name="f247">[247]</a></p>

<p>Blair&#8217;s stakeholding is based on faith in &#8216;a cohesive society,
one nation&#8217;. <a href="#n248" name="f248">[248]</a> He has made the
&#8216;moral assertion that individuals are interdependent, that they owe
duties to one another as well as themselves ... the belief that only
by recognising their interdependence will individuals flourish,
because the good of each does dependent on the good of all., that the
good society backs up the efforts of the individuals within it.&#8217;
<a href="#n249" name="f249">[249]</a> This exciting new idea turns
out to be strangely reminiscent of the speeches of Lord Salisbury,
who, in 1880, professed his belief in:</p>

<p class="quoteb">a homogeneous people. It is only a people who in the main
are agreed &#8211; who upon deep questions that concern a community think
with each other, who have sympathy with each other, and have common
interests ... it is only people who have these conditions of united
action who can have any prospect of prosperity and success. <a href="#n250" name="f250">[250]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lord Salisbury was a Victorian Tory Prime Minister, a
&#8216;self-proclaimed enemy of democracy&#8217; who described socialists as
&#8216;looters&#8217;. <a href="#n251" name="f251">[251]</a> Blair&#8217;s New
Labour reeks of very old one nation Toryism.</p>

<p>None of this solves the basic contradiction that will face Blair
if he is elected. What will happen when the millions who for years
have been gritting their teeth and containing their pent up anger,
find Blair carrying on with more or less the same policies as the
Tories? How will they feel when the massive gap between rich and poor
grows under market conditions, when people still die because there
are no available NHS beds, the school roof continues to leak, and the
boss still treats them with contempt?</p>

enough in her approach to sanction entry into the European Exchange

steps towards the sort of European Union she so detested. Equally
her successor has survived Tory internal divisions on the issue.</p>
