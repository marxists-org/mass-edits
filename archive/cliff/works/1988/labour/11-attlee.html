<h1>11. The Attlee Government:<br/>
Zenith off Reformism</h1>

<br/>
<h4>The apotheosis</h4>

<p class="fst">THE ATTLEE ADMINISTRATION of 1945 was not only the first majority
Labour government, it represented the high point of Labour Party
history. From 1951 we are on the other side of the mountain.</p>
<p>The memory of this government has become sacrosanct for both the
right and the left of the Labour Party. Thus Bevan&#8217;s political
testament <strong>In Place of Fear</strong>, published in 1952, contains not a
hint of criticism of the government in which he served for nearly six
years. On 23 April 1951 Bevan declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Ever since 1945 we have been engaged in this country in
the most remarkable feat of social reconstruction the world has ever
seen. By the end of 1950 we had ... assumed the moral leadership of
the world. There is only one hope for mankind, and that hope still
remains in this little island. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Similarly Tony Benn, in his book <strong>Arguments for Socialism</strong>
makes numerous admiring references to the heritage of the Attlee
government. The right-wing Labour leaders, from Morrison to Crosland,
from Dalton to Hattersley, say the same.</p>

<p>Whatever the myths regarding the Labour government of 1945&#8211;51,
there is no doubt that it was the most effective reformist Labour
government of them all. The task of political analysis, however, is
not simply to describe appearances, but to ask more fundamental
questions. How much continuity was there with past Labour governments
which had performed as the managers of capitalism? If Labour policies
did develop in new directions, as it would appear, were these a
vindication of the way gradualism and reformism were taking
&#8216;practical steps towards socialism?&#8217;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Nationalisation</h4>

<p class="fst">The 1945&#8211;51 government is remembered for two positive policies:
nationalisation and the welfare state.</p>

<p>In 1919 the miners&#8217; demand for nationalisation had brought
Britain closer to revolution than at any other time this century. The
same demand in 1947 had no such implications. Why was this? Two
things had changed and as a capitalist workers&#8217; party Labour was
deeply affected by both: first the attitude of the ruling class;
second the logic of reformism, which had progressed to a new stage.</p>

<p>When Marx summarised the aim of capitalism he described it as
&#8216;Accumulate, accumulate &#8211; that is Moses and the prophets&#8217;.
Capitalism, therefore, is not a &#8216;juridical relationship&#8217;; it is
not based on legal notions of ownership. Historically forms of
ownership have been extremely flexible, ranging from the small
individual entrepreneur through the joint stock company to giant
multinationals; from almost 100 per cent private ownership on the
American model to 100 per cent state ownership on Stalinist lines.</p>

<p>Therefore state ownership in no way implies socialism. Socialism
means the economic and social liberation of the working class by
subordinating the creation of wealth to the fulfilment of human
needs. This can be achieved only when workers themselves take
political power directly, through institutions such as <em>soviets</em>
or workers councils.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s approach to nationalisation was set out in its 1945
Manifesto, <strong>Let us Face the Future</strong>. This argued for the state
takeover of certain branches of the economy &#8211; the Bank of England,
coal mines, electricity and gas, railways, and iron and steel.
Nationalisation measures were justified on grounds of economic
efficiency, not as a means of shifting the balance between labour and
capital. Each case was argued empirically. Thus &#8216;public ownership
of gas and electricity undertakings would lower charges, prevent
competitive wastage, open the way for coordinated research and
development.&#8217; By arguing for piecemeal nationalisation Labour
accepted the mixed economy; by no means a socialist society, but a
variant of the consensus achieved in rough outline during the war.</p>

<p>Thus it was that when the election results became known, employers
accepted the Labour programme of a mixed economy with good grace.
They had reasons.</p>

<p>Given British capitalism&#8217;s previous history, one might have
expected it to yearn for <em>laissez-faire</em>, as it did in 1919.
However after the Second World War this option had grave drawbacks.
In 1945 nobody could predict with certainty that a long boom lay
ahead instead of a return to depression.</p>

<p>Secondly, modem capitalism required a well-developed
infrastructure, including transport and power supplies, in order to
function efficiently. Now this &#8216;social overhead capital&#8217; tended
to be costly, requiring long-term investment, and its benefits
accrued to industry as a whole rather than to the individual
entrepreneur. For these reasons the infrastructure in most countries
was developed and controlled by governments. In 1945 British capital
was ready to break with tradition. It was unwilling to tie up large
sums in rebuilding necessary but largely unprofitable areas of
industry after the ravages of war. So the bulk of Attlee&#8217;s
nationalisation programme did not worry capital in the least.</p>

<p>The coal industry was a prime example. It suffered from
obsolescence, which, unless remedied, would act as a brake on the
rest of the economy.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Mining Association now declared its willingness to
withdraw its opposition to nationalisation of coalmining, &#8216;because
of the result of the General Election&#8217;. This lamb-like utterance
from the former lions of &#8216;excessively tenacious individualism&#8217;
was not unconnected with the fact that the antiquated equipment of
industry had been worked to its limit during the war and now needed
drastic renewal that manpower would soon be scarce enough to win
concessions, and that oil looked like undercutting the monopoly value
of coal. It was not a bad time to sell out. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus it was that leading Tories did not oppose the nationalisation
of the mines. Even Churchill, the uncompromising class warrior, did
not resist. Nor did he fight nationalisation of the Bank of England,
which in this era of Keynesian planning was a logical step. He said
in parliament that the nationalisation of the Bank of England &#8216;does
not, in my opinion, raise any issue of principle.&#8217; <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a>
Both the retiring governor of the Bank, Lord Catto, the retiring
deputy governor, Cameron Cobbold, were reappointed.</p>

<p>The actual process of takeover was easy. In the case of the Bank
of England, coal, gas, electricity and transport, a close
relationship with the government was already well established in
1945. Between October 1945 and January 1948 the government introduced
legislation to nationalise all of these. The measures evoked little
Commons opposition.</p>

<p>To sum up, nationalisation of these industries was vital for the
expansion of the profitable industries that remained private. It
strengthened the private sector by freeing it of the burden of
industries which demanded heavy investment and were essential to the
running of all industry.</p>

<p>So the employers cooperated. They readily continued to staff the
system of wartime controls, which was operated largely by
representatives of private industry and prolonged by the government.
<a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> In the words of Ralph Miliband, the
government enjoyed the cooperation of private industry. Or more
accurately, private industry enjoyed the cooperation of the
Government.&#8217; <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p>The government ensured that the management structure of
nationalised industries served the general needs of capitalism and
did not offer any element of workers&#8217; control that others might
want to emulate. There were joyful mass demonstrations on vesting day
&#8211; 1 January 1947, when the coal mines were taken over and the
ensign of the National Coal Board replaced that of the old
discredited private owners. But the rejoicing soon stopped; for the
NCB, like other nationalised industries, took the form of a public
corporation, a copy of the structure of private industry with the
same hierarchical relationship between managers and workers. Managers
were recruited from former management. Thus the head of the National
Coal Board had previously been involved with one of the largest
private colliery companies. No wonder there were so many unofficial
strikes in the mines.</p>

<p>Summing up the Attlee government, one historian wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Whatever aspect of the Labour program one considers, one
always returns to the same theme: a similar policy was advocated,
perhaps even before Labour advocated it, by non-socialists. Central
economic planning under the post-war Labour Governments ... involved
little more than the application of Keynesian nostrums ... one of the
most remarkable things about Labour&#8217;s nationalization measures is
that most of them were enacted in response to the reports of
Conservative-dominated investigating committees: the Bank of England
measure as a result of the Macmillan Report, coal because of the Reid
Report, gas because of the Hayworth Report, electricity because of
the McGowan report. Moreover, nationalization, as carried out by
Labour, made use of an administrative device first worked out by
Liberal and Conservative governments &#8211; the &#8216;public corporation&#8217;. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The nationalisation programme eventually affected between two and
three million workers and involved roughly one-fifth of total
economic activity. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> <em>But there it stopped.</em></p>

<p>This was of the greatest significance. All Labour leaders accepted
the idea of the mixed economy, even Nye Bevan, who chaired the
sub-committee of the Labour Party executive on privately-owned
industry. He was anxious to reassure private capitalists that their
interests were being looked after, so as to gain financial stability
for the economy as a whole. Bevan made the mixed economy a question
of principle &#8211; not a transition to the total nationalisation of the
economy, but an aim in itself. To quote the words of Jennie Lee, his wife:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Hence Nye&#8217;s much quoted phrase, &#8216;the commanding
heights of the economy&#8217;. Let the State bring order out of the
anarchy of unrestrained private enterprise by taking over industries
essential for a planned economy, such as coal, steel, transport and
such like, but leave ample margins for private individuals and groups
of individuals to make their contribution. Total nationalisation is
not compatible with a democratic, constitutional, parliamentary
system. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This attitude represented a landmark in Labour&#8217;s history. True,
the government&#8217;s nationalisation schemes surpassed all previous
measures, but the voluntary acceptance of a mixed economy was a
departure from previous beliefs. For all that the Fabians represented
a ruling class current, their &#8216;state socialism&#8217; had never
intended to leave 80 per cent of the economy in the hands of private
profit-makers. Clause Four&#8217;s &#8216;social ownership&#8217; was clearly
understood to apply to as much of industry as administratively
possible. Of course the two previous minority Labour governments
could plausibly argue they could do little to carry it out. In 1945
no such excuse existed, so the Labour leadership simply re-wrote the
political textbook.</p>

<p>The synthesis of class and nation now meant a mixture nationalised
and private enterprise. Capitalism would not be overthrown, but made
more efficient and more humane by laying the foundations of a mixed
economy and welfare state. The logic of reformism was on a new plane
when Labour not only <em>acted</em> as manager of capitalism, but
<em>justified</em> it without shame. To buy 20 per cent of the economy
it sold its political soul.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Welfare</h4>

<p class="fst">If Labour&#8217;s policies were designed chiefly to benefit the ruling
class, in conditions of boom crumbs could still be thrown to workers.
Under Attlee, workers and their families fared much better than
before the war. The government</p>

<p class="quoteb">kept up a high level of expenditure on the social
services; while food subsidies were pegged in the April 1949 budget
at &#163;465 million, they still represented a formidable sum and did
much to keep down the cost of living for working people ... And of
course, full employment and relatively mild inflation were
immeasurable boons to workers everywhere, for which much else would
be forgiven. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The flagship of the welfare state was the National Health Service,
which seemed for once to rise above the sordid calculations of profit
and loss that blight the industrial world, nationalised corporations
included. Nye Bevan was the minister of health who introduced the
scheme. He explained: &#8216;The field in which the claims of individual
commercialism come into most immediate conflict with reputable
notions of social value is that of health.&#8217; <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>However, the origins of the welfare state date as far back as the
Workmen&#8217;s Compensation Act of 1893 and Liberal schemes of old age
pensions, unemployment and health insurance, which were introduced
after 1906. These were certainly not socialist in motivation. Nor
could the shortlived Conservative caretaker administration which
began family allowances in 1945 be described as socialist.</p>

<p>As Marx and Engels showed, there is a basic contradiction within
capitalism: &#8216;The essential condition for the existence, and for the
sway of the bourgeois class, is the formation and augmentation of
capital; the condition for capital is wage labour.&#8217; <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a>
Labour power is the most important productive force in capitalism.</p>

<p>The ruling class regards workers not as human beings, but as
providers of labour power, a simple factor of production. Just as
efficient transport and energy supplies are vital, so a productive,
educated and healthy workforce is necessary. This is particularly
true in periods of expansion when bosses require new skills and are
unable to pick the &#8216;best&#8217; workers from a pool of unemployed.
Therefore welfare provision fully accorded with a planned Keynesian
economy. The state would help sustain the physical and human
infrastructure. Thus the head of Courtaulds, the textile giant,
predicted Beveridge&#8217;s plans would &#8216;be about the most profitable
long-term investment the country could make.&#8217; <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>Expansion of the welfare state was based on three Acts in 1946
(the National Health Service Act and two National Insurance Acts) and
the National Assistance Act of 1948. They were effective. Take the
NHS. It tackled an appalling situation. Of two and a half million men
surveyed during the First World War, only three in every nine were
fully &#8216;fit and healthy&#8217;, three were in reasonable condition, two
were &#8216;incapable of undergoing more than a very moderate degree of
physical exertion&#8217; and one was &#8216;a chronic invalid with a
precarious hold on life.&#8217; In the 1930s 83 per cent of Durham
children were found to be suffering from rickets. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a>
Today, partly as a result of the NHS, formerly common diseases such
as tuberculosis and rickets are a rarity and general health is
greatly improved.</p>

<p>In introducing the NHS Bevan met bitter opposition from the
British Medical Association (BMA), the main doctors&#8217; pressure
group, which was supported by the Tory Party and their press run
rampant. Bevan made a whole series of concessions to them, which left
the door ajar for the future erosion of the service. Hospital
consultants could retain private beds as well as receiving a salary
for cooperating with the state scheme. As John Campbell, Bevan&#8217;s
biographer, rightly says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Bevan arguably paid too high a price for the consultants&#8217;
support ... Since they were now to be paid for the work they had
previously done (in the voluntary hospitals) for nothing, they
achieved the best of both worlds &#8211; the regular pay of the municipal
hospitals with the prestige of the voluntary, plus private fees. No
wonder Bevan was reported to have said &#8216;I stuffed their mouths with
gold.&#8217; And as well as gold he gave them power, the predominant
power to shape the new service. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The medical journal <strong>The Lancet </strong>said in November 1946 that
the NHS was &#8216;much less socialistic than was predicted a year ago.&#8217; <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p>The Socialist Medical Association and Labour backbenchers were
disappointed to find the 1945 manifesto promise of a national,
full-time salaried service had been lost through concessions to the
BMA. Bevan knew how much had been conceded: as he told MPs in 1948,
private patients, private beds and private fees put the ideal of a
free and equal health service for all in &#8216;a very grave danger and
it was a very serious and substantial concession made to the medical
profession ... that was repugnant to many of my hon. Friends.&#8217; <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p>The net result, in Campbell&#8217;s words, was:</p>

<p class="quoteb">to contrive the appearance of a political triumph for his
party when in fact he had enacted virtually none of the cherished
nostrums of those in the Labour Party who had cared about health.
&#8216;His outstanding success&#8217;, one of his critics wryly noted, &#8216;was
the way he applied the anaesthetic to supporters on his own side,
making them believe in things they had opposed almost all their
lives.&#8217; <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Just as with nationalisation, employers and the working class had
different reasons for welcoming the welfare state. From the workers&#8217;
point of view, they and their families do not exist merely to
reproduce and sell labour power. Good health, decent education and
housing are valued for improving the quality of life, not the
employer&#8217;s bank balance.</p>

<p>A capitalist workers&#8217; party tries to get the best of both
worlds, but in a clash has to choose sides. The meaning of
nationalisation was exposed by the struggle over profitable
industries like road haulage and steel. Was welfare there to make
British industry more productive, or did social spending (financed
largely through direct taxes on income), represent the thin end of a
wedge which would ultimately bring the redistribution of wealth from
rich to poor?</p>

<p>The issue became a live one at the end of Labour&#8217;s term of
office. The deteriorating balance of payments, higher taxation and
cuts in the already meagre food rations had already disillusioned
many socialists. The question then arose: was it more important to
sustain the Health Service or back American imperialism in Korea,
where war broke out in 1950? The defence budget, much expanded during
the Korean war, led to Bevan&#8217;s resignation from the government in
April 1951. When Gaitskell, chancellor of the exchequer after Cripps
fell critically ill, imposed prescription, denture and spectacle
charges, Bevan had had enough.</p>

<p>The Health Service was mauled, but it survived. How exceptional
was it? In Britain modem health provision was introduced by a
reformist government. Yet in countries without social democratic
governments the proportion of social product going to health has been
far higher. Until 1969 NHS spending never exceeded 4.5 per cent of
Britain&#8217;s GNP, whereas in that year the Netherlands spent 5.9 per
cent, the US 6.8 per cent and Canada 7.3 per cent. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a>
However it would be a mistake to assume that Britain&#8217;s low
proportion of GNP going to health meant the NHS lagged behind other
countries: the <em>universal and free</em> nature of the NHS meant that
low income groups benefitted greatly. Also in places like the US,
doctors take a far greater proportion of the money spent on health
than they do in Britain.</p>

<p>Nevertheless social spending is not a peculiarly Labour policy.
Between 1945 and the election of Tory prime minister Margaret
Thatcher in 1979 the Labour Party was in government roughly half the
time. But spending on welfare benefits in Britain compared
unfavourably with other European countries which have not had social
democratic rule. West Germany, France, and even Spain, offered in a
number of fields welfare benefits more generous than those in
Britain. &#8216;Among the eighteen advanced industrial democracies
included in the OECD sample, Britain devotes 12.6 per cent of the
gross domestic product to [welfare], but is surpassed by ten
countries in this group, and is below the average (13.25).&#8217; <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>

<p>To conclude, Labour supporters often presume that major reforms
must have originated from their party. This is too simplistic.
Historically there are two types of legislative reform, that wrested
from below, and that handed down from above.</p>

<p>Lenin described the situation in Tsarist Russia in which reforms
were &#8216;merely a by-product of revolutionary class struggle&#8217; and
&#8216;possible only as a by-product of a movement that is completely
free of all narrowness of reformism ...&#8217; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a>
Labour can certainly never be accused of fighting for reforms by such
revolutionary methods.</p>

<p>The question arising about Attlee&#8217;s reforms is whether they were
achieved because Labour was in office, or would the capitalist class
have conceded them anyway, whatever party was in government? The
welfare state is a case in point.</p>

<p>The Labour government did not transform the state from &#8216;the
executive committee of the ruling class&#8217; into some classless
benefactor. It brought in a set of changes that the employing class
intended to be a &#8216;profitable long-term investment&#8217;. They were not
and never could be, a serious inroad to the power of the system
itself. The Labour Party, depending on reforms from above, and
discouraging mass movements from below, can do exceedingly little to
shape what happens. By holding back the working class &#8211; the real
force for socialist change &#8211; they are left in a situation in which
their ability to improve the lives of their working-class supporters
depends almost entirely on the vigour of the national capitalism.</p>

<p>The Tories would not necessarily have acted in precisely the same
fashion. A reformist party in government may achieve changes that are
different <em>in form</em> from those of a reactionary party, but only
within strict limits determined by the system. The NHS could not rise
above these constraints. From the point of view of capitalism the NHS
was an efficient method of maintaining a fit and able workforce at
minimum cost, so the principle behind the system was not seriously
attacked until the 1980s, even by the Tories. Nevertheless, even
before this the health of workers was subordinated to the health of
capitalism. Whenever things became tight the NHS was attacked. And
the first cuts came from Attlee&#8217;s Labour government; later, as the
sickness of British capitalism grew, both Labour and Tory governments
would attack the NHS with increasing ferocity.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The turning point: 1947, &#8216;<em>Annus Horrendus</em>&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">Until the start of 1947, the Labour government&#8217;s reforming
programme seemed to advance without a hitch. It had established an
impressive record of legislative achievement, with more than seventy
Bills carried through parliament in the 1945&#8211;6 session, including
the introduction of widespread public ownership, the National Health
and National Insurance Bills and the reform of the law on trade
unions. Within the Labour Party itself there was immense enthusiasm.
Outside, popular support for the government was solid.</p>

<p>One factor ensuring mass support for the government was full
employment. Throughout Labour&#8217;s tenure of office, unemployment was
extremely low (except during the fuel crisis of winter 1947 when it
reached 3 per cent). There were three and a half million more workers
employed in June 1951 than six years previously. In labour Party
mythology this was entirely due to government policy. However, Sir
Alec Cairncross, an economic adviser to the Attlee government, saw
behind the appearances:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The maintenance of a high level of employment was only to
a limited extent the government&#8217;s doing. It was made easy because
world markets remained in a state of boom ... What can be claimed for
the Labour government is that the one thing that it had to plan, and
did plan &#8211; the balance of payments &#8211; was effectively planned. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The dominant figure in the first period of Labour policy was the
chancellor of the exchequer, Hugh Dalton. Dalton&#8217;s policy of &#8216;cheap
money&#8217; symbolised the new era, in total contrast to the deflation
and retrenchment that had dominated the policy of the Treasury after
1918. Dalton&#8217;s financial policy underlay the social reforms, the
industrial reconstruction, and the public investment projects of the
first two years.</p>

<p>However, social reforms financed by expansionist policies were
only part, and a lesser part, of the government&#8217;s aims. It was also
the manager of capitalism, both at home, and defending Britain&#8217;s
imperial role. Until 1947 reforms and the needs of capitalism did not
conflict. But the foundations of British capitalism, upon which the
reforms depended, were shaky.</p>

<p>During the war the British ruling class lost a massive portion of
its foreign assets. Income from these was now no longer available to
pay for imports of food and raw materials. Additionally the war
itself had given Britain accumulated debts of &#163;2,723 million around
the world. In 1945 estimates held that exports would have to increase
by between 50 and 70 per cent just to finance imports on the same
scale as before the war. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a>
Furthermore, Britain&#8217;s imperialist commitments added to the burden
on its economy. In March 1948 there were still 937,000 in the armed forces.</p>

<p>The underlying weaknesses were suddenly brought to the surface in
1947. The previous year had been a very successful one for the
government. According to a leading article in the <strong>News Chronicle</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Industrially the year has been marked by steady progress.
Unemployment (apart from a few areas in Scotland and Wales) has been
almost negligible. Britain, too, is almost the only democratic
country in the world which has survived 1946 without a major
industrial dispute. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In total contrast, 1947 was a year of almost unmitigated disaster.
It began with terrible weather. The winter of early 1947 was, as the
Annual Register recorded, the &#8216;most severe since 1880&#8211;1.&#8217;</p>

<p class="quoteb">The result was calamitous. Coal stocks, already failing,
slumped to below the four million tons level, which was regarded as
the minimum for national survival. Coal could not be transported by
rail or road; collier vessels from Newcastle, bringing coal to power
stations in London and the south-east, could not put to sea. Shinwell
told a stunned House of Commons on 7 February that many power
stations had run out of coal, that much of industry would therefore
have to close down, and that many domestic consumers would have to do
without electricity for large parts of the day ... Factories were
closed down; villages were cut off; livestock died in thousands;
people froze in their homes without even the radio as a solace since
that, too, was a victim of the power crisis. Unemployment reached
over two millions by the start of February. Not until March was there
any visible improvement in fuel supplies; in the end, the government
was rescued only by an improvement in the climate in late March. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Dalton described 1947 as the &#8216;<em>annus horrendus</em>&#8217; <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a>, and the laying off of more than two million workers certainly did not
assist the financial crisis that followed. In the first quarter of
1947 Britain&#8217;s reserves of dollars were heavily depleted as a
result of a world-wide shortage of food and raw materials which left
the USA as virtually the sole supplier. The &#8216;dollar drain&#8217; was
associated with very negative terms of trade for Britain. The British
fuel crisis of January-February 1947 made things even worse.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Indeed, the dollar drain in the first six months of 1947
swept away some $1,890 million, more than half the original US loan
of $3,750 million. At that rate, the loan, intended to last Britain
until 1951, would run out by 1948, or even earlier. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Since Britain was committed, by the terms of the July 1946
American loan, to allow the pound to be freely convertible into
dollars on the foreign exchanges by July 1947, the country faced
financial catastrophe.</p>

<p>The government was not responsible for the weather. But this
natural event had uncovered what was to become the perennial problem
of the postwar British economy &#8211; the tendency for rising domestic
demand to encourage imports as much as home production. Moreover this
became progressively worse as time went on. There were sterling
crises in 1947, 1949, 1951, 1955, 1957, 1961, and between 1963 and
1967. Hence the &#8216;stop-go&#8217; cycle: the chancellor stimulated
demand, which led to increased imports and caused a balance of
payments deficit, and hence a speculative attack on the pound.
Restoring confidence was achieved by raising the interest rate,
imposing cuts and increasing taxes in order to lower the level of
demand in the economy. In the short run this deflation worked, but in
the long run it delayed investment, slowed technical change, caused
low productivity and weakened Britain&#8217;s competitive position in the
world. The periods of &#8216;go&#8217; got shorter, while the periods of
&#8216;stop&#8217; got longer.</p>

<p>The first postwar financial crisis, of August 1947, was the
gravest Britain had experienced since August 1931. The Attlee
government panicked. A new financial policy was put forward, with
dire implications for the entire thrust of Labour&#8217;s reforming
strategy. Deflation, cuts in basic rations of meat, fat, sugar and
other foodstuffs &#8211; these were the essential ingredients of Dalton&#8217;s
November 1947 budget. On 13 November Dalton resigned the
chancellorship (having carelessly leaked some items of his budget to
a newspaper reporter). Cripps took his place, to continue the
austerity programme with a vengeance.</p>

<p>The entire direction of government had been dramatically altered,
and the limits of reformism revealed with startling clarity. While
socialists would have hoped Labour would thrust the burden of the
crisis on to those most capable of bearing it, the opposite was true.
The man in charge of government economic policy from August 1947
until 1950 was Stafford Cripps, the <em>enfant terrible</em> of the
1930s. His first move was to reassure business and the city.</p>

<p>Cripps&#8217; penchant for draconian measures found a new target. He
began with the imposition of a series of austerity measures: a sharp
reduction of consumer purchasing power, new indirect purchase taxes
and heavy cuts in imports which had to be paid for in dollars.
Consumers faced reductions in living standards after the cabinet
decision to cut food imports by &#163;66m and basic rations. This would
cut the average calorie intake per person per day to between 2,650
and 2,725 in the first half of 1948, compared with 3,000 in the last
year of the war. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> When Cripps
announced these measures in the Commons, he was highly praised by <strong>The
Times</strong> &#8216;before he had ended his 100-minute speech Sir Stafford
Cripps had sounded a note which stirred the pulses of the House.&#8217; <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p>Plans were made to increase exports further, to restrict consumer
spending and to cut public investment, especially the housing
programme. While the capitalists got financial inducements from the
Treasury, the workers had to pay higher taxes, with a shift in the
balance from direct to indirect taxes.</p>

<p>One of the key elements in Cripps&#8217; policy was the encouragement
of an export drive by diverting manpower to the export trade as never
before. From the summer of 1948 further help came with the injection
of dollars through Marshall Aid, the US postwar aid programme for
Western Europe.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The obverse of this concentration on exports was the
remorseless cutting down of resources for the consumer at home.
Rationing of food, clothing, petrol, and other commodities had
continued since the end of the war. In the Cripps era, the system
reached new extremes of severity. By 1948, the average citizen had to
make do with a weekly ration of thirteen ounces of meat, one and a
half ounces of cheese, six ounces of butter and margarine, one ounce
of cooking fat, eight ounces of sugar, two pints of milk, and a
solitary egg. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Side by side with this rationing there was the &#8216;black market&#8217;,
which would supply all the luxuries you required &#8211; as long, of
course, as you could afford to pay the price.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Wage restraint</h4>

<p class="fst">The corollary of control of consumption through rationing and
other austerity measures was the attempt to control wages. In a
munition of full employment, with a confident working class, it would
take more than political wiles to pull this off. Above all, Labour&#8217;s
trump card &#8211; the loyalty of the trade unions &#8211; would have to be played.</p>

<p>On 4 February 1948 Attlee announced a White Paper titled <em>Statement
on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices</em>. It demanded that there
should be no increase in wages, salaries or dividends, save in
exceptional circumstances. Trade union leaders at once went to
Downing Street in a body and demanded the withdrawal of this
&#8216;unacceptable attempt to interfere with free collective
bargaining&#8217;. They had, after all, created the Labour Representation
Committee in 1900 with the express intention of removing such
government interference after Taff Vale.</p>

<p>The TUC&#8217;s Economic Committee expressed concern at the While
Paper and especially at Cripps&#8217; call for a wage freeze. Cripps&#8217;
negotiations with the TUC did not go well, especially since he was
unwilling to tax profits or dividends any further. But the
all-too-familiar spell of &#8216;don&#8217;t rock the boat&#8217; wrought its
magic for the Labour government. A conference of trade union
executive delegates on 24 March voted by the comfortable majority of
5,421,000 to 2,012,000 to accept the policy of wage freeze for the
foreseeable future. The opposition was made up of the engineers&#8217;,
electricians&#8217;, shopworkers&#8217; and other unions, especially those
representing the low-paid. The same policy was endorsed by the TUC
Congress later in the year.</p>

<p>The call for working-class sacrifice rang hollow against the
impressive achievements of British industry at the time. The volume
of industrial production in the first half of 1949 was 30 per cent
above that of 1938; exports had risen from 50 per cent below pre-war
level to nearly 55 per cent above; and earnings from exports covered
85 per cent of the cost of imports &#8211; the best performance in
Europe. But financial pressures still forced the government to
devalue the pound in September 1949. This led to a significant rise
in the cost of living, as the prices of imported goods soared.</p>

<p>Cripps was also demanding a reduction in public expenditure of
some &#163;700 million. The foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, and the
minister of defence, Albert Alexander, were threatening to resign if
the full weight of the cuts fell on defence; Nye Bevan was
threatening to resign if social expenditure suffered unduly; Cripps
was threatening to resign unless all agreed with him.</p>

<p>Finally, on 21 October 1949, the cabinet put forward a package of
cuts with a total deflationary effect of &#163;280 million. Attlee
announced these measures to a completely silent House of Commons, and
sat down in front of benches of openly dispirited supporters. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p>After the devaluation of the pound, it became far more difficult
for the union leaders to hold the line for the government on the
wages front. A special conference of trade union executives in
January 1950 endorsed the policy of wage restraint by only a very
narrow margin &#8211; 4,263,000 votes to 3,606,000. When the Korean war
pushed the rate of inflation even higher, the 1950 TUC Congress voted
down the wage freeze by 3,949,000 to 3,727,000. Both the
Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions and the rail
unions took tentative steps which might have led w official national
strikes. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a></p>

<p>Nonetheless the government wages policy had been successful. As
Cairncross explains:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The White Paper policy undoubtedly slowed down the rise
in wages and prices. In the first two post-war years from June 1945
to June 1947 hourly wage rates had increased, first by 9 per cent,
then by 8.5 per cent. In the next nine months to March 1948 the rise
continued at nearly 9 per cent per annum. From then until the
devaluation eighteen months later, the annual rate of increase fell
to 2.8 per cent ... [After inflation was accounted for] real wages
were stationary or falling ... That money wages rose so little when
real wages were stationary or falling and unemployment was down to
300,000 is striking testimony to the influence of the trade-union
leaders. Hourly wage rates after March 1948 rose no faster than in
the mid-1930s, between 1934 and 1938, when unemployment was around
two million. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As a reward for sacrificing their members&#8217; living standards,
union officials were welcomed on to an increasing number of
government committees: in 1931 there had been union representatives
on only one such committee; by 1939 they had been on twelve, and by
1948&#8211;49 they were on sixty. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The strike-breaking government</h4>

<p class="fst">One sign of how the union bureaucracy successfully imposed
Labour&#8217;s wage restraint was the lack of industrial resistance.
Compare this to the level after the First World War when Labour was
in opposition. During 1945&#8211;50 fewer than ten million man-days were
lost through strikes, compared with 170 million in the five years
1918&#8211;1923, an average of less than two million days per year as
against more than 35 million.</p>

<p>Nevertheless those few workers who did strike were not treated
with kid gloves. Order 1305, which had made wartime strikes illegal
and had been justified as necessary to defeat fascism, was continued.
In 1950 and 1951 the government used the order to prosecute ten gas
workers and seven dockers. These decisions enraged the whole trade
union movement, and the order had to be terminated in August 1951.
The minister of labour regularly attributed strikes to Communist
agitation. An enormous weight of vilification was heaped on the heads
of shop stewards who during the war had been described as loyal
patriots, but were now &#8216;extremists&#8217; and &#8216;subversives&#8217;. Labour
set the tone for what was to be a long-running media witch-hunt of
industrial militants.</p>

<p>Throughout the lifetime of the Attlee government the military were
used again and again to break strikes. Thus, cabinet minutes of 5
July 1950 included the following:</p>

<p class="fst">Historians report that when the government used troops to break
strikes &#8216;there was no hesitation about it and no reservation around
the cabinet table.&#8217; <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> Nye Bevan concurred!</p>

<p>The Attlee government evoked the Emergency Powers Act of 1920 &#8211;
the first time it had been used since the general strike of 1926. The
government revived the Supply and Transport Organisation, which had
been used to help crush the general strike, and it did so with the
complete agreement of Nye Bevan and Stafford Cripps. &#8216;It would be
prudent to have wide powers in order to deal with any trouble that
might arise&#8217;, Bevan told the cabinet&#8217;s industrial emergency
committee on 28 June 1948. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>

<p>In May 1947 Bevan urged the use of legal steps by the
attorney-general against dockworkers responsible for &#8216;the
instigation of illegal strikes.&#8217; <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a>
When busmen in the Midlands and the North went on strike, Bevan
argued for the use of military vehicles to transport miners. Miners,
of all people!</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Minister of Health felt that there would be great
advantage in stating publicly that in view of the overriding
importance of maintaining coal production the Government had decided
to make military vehicles available for carrying miners to and from
their work. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When workers in the power stations in London went on strike, it
was Bevan, as minister responsible for labour, who, on 24 January
1950, argued for civil proceedings as these had &#8216;worked as an
effective deterrent in the mining industry.&#8217; <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a>
Bevan was minister of labour during January&#8211;April 1951 when seven
London dockers were prosecuted under Order 1305. He rounded on a
group of heckling dockers at Bermondsey: &#8216;Shut up ... Do you think
the government should do nothing about it?&#8217; There was more shouting
and Bevan declared: &#8216;You are a lot of skulking cowards hiding
behind your own anonymity ...&#8217; <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p>Bevan&#8217;s old comrade from the Socialist League, Cripps, was still
more original. At a meeting of the cabinet&#8217;s industrial emergency
committee on 15 January 1947, when 20,000 London dockers were on
strike, he suggested that the large number of Polish ex-servicemen in
the country might be used as blacklegs for the maintenance of
essential supplies. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p>The cabinet&#8217;s discussion in 1947 of equal pay for women, which
had been unequivocally adopted as policy by party conference, was one
of the most nauseating performances. The quibbling went on and on.
Eventually &#8216;The Cabinet accepted the principle but not the
implementation.&#8217; <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a> Three years
later George Isaacs, then minister of labour, still argued in a
memorandum to the cabinet that equal pay should not be introduced in
government employment. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p>Geoff Ellen summed up the Labour government&#8217;s strike-breaking
activity thus:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Striking dockers, gas workers, miners and lorry drivers
were denounced, spied upon and prosecuted. Two States of Emergency
were proclaimed against them and two more were narrowly averted.
Above all, the government used blacklegs against these strikes, often
with the connivance of the strikers&#8217; own trade union leaders. On 18
different occasions between 1945 and 1951, the government sent
troops, sometimes 20,000 of them, across picket lines to take over
strikers&#8217; jobs. By 1948, it has been argued, &#8216;strike-breaking had
become almost second nature to the Cabinet&#8217;. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Reforming zeal gives way to the consensus of &#8216;Butskellism&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">In the 1950s <strong>The Economist</strong> introduced a new term to the
English language &#8211; Butskellism. This was the name given to the
growing similarity between Labour and Conservative Party practices.
Butskellism was a legacy of the postwar Labour government and its policies.</p>

<p>In December 1946 an unofficial Industrial Policy Committee was
formed, made up of a number of Tory MPs and chaired by R.A. Butler,
the author of the 1944 Education Act. It produced an Industrial
Charter, which was enthusiastically received by a Tory conference in
October 1947. The charter accepted state intervention to ensure full
employment. Although nationalisation was forsworn as a principle of
government, the cases of coal, the railways and the Bank of England
were accepted in practice. Labour&#8217;s welfare legislation was also
accepted. Above all Butler described the charter as &#8216;an assurance
that, in the interests of efficiency, full employment and social
security, modern Conservatism would maintain strong central guidance
over the operation of the economy.&#8217; <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>

<p>Of course not all Conservatives welcomed the Industrial Charter.
Thus Sir Waldron Smithers called it &#8216;milk and water&#8217; socialism.
<a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a> On the other hand, Harold
Macmillan later said that the Industrial Charter &#8216;proclaimed the
theme which inspired thirteen years of Conservative government which
followed the final overthrow of the Socialists in 1951.&#8217; <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>

<p>When the Conservatives won the general election of October 1951,
Churchill appointed Butler chancellor of the exchequer in succession
to Hugh Gaitskell. The break between the policies of the two was so
minuscule that <strong>The Economist</strong> invented this new word,
Butskellism, to describe it. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a>
Richard Crossman, an MP and supporter of Nye Bevan, saw the new
Conservative cabinet as &#8216;only very slightly to the right of the
most recent Attlee Cabinet&#8217;, and commented that &#8216;just as Attlee
was running what was virtually a coalition policy on a Party basis,
so Churchill may well do the same.&#8217; <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a></p>

<p>A consensus on economic and social policy had been forged.</p>

<p>However the Tories accepted only those measures which were
unequivocally of benefit to their class. Nationalisation could be
tolerated where the infrastructure was run-down and unprofitable. But
even here there were pockets of industry where money could be made.
Real resistance developed as soon as it looked as though going
concerns such as road haulage and electricity, but above all during
1950&#8211;1 the steel industry, were to be nationalised.</p>

<p>One of the sticks used to beat supporters of further
nationalisation was the inevitably low profitability of the
dilapidated industries that were taken over. The fact was that coal
was sold to private industry with a hidden subsidy. This helped make
the NCB unprofitable, but it was a godsend for anti-nationalisation
propaganda. A Gallup poll in November 1948 found only 24 per cent of
the population supported the proposed nationalisation of steel while
44 per cent opposed it. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a> In the
altered political climate that prevailed after 1947 this mild not but
influence the more hesitant reformists, whose confidence was already
dented. The effect on Labour was double-edged. On the right there
were those who were satisfied that Nationalisation had completed its
job of assisting private profit-making. They therefore opposed its
extension to steel. However some on the left still saw the programme
so far as merely the first step towards socialism.</p>

<p>A long period of dispute was beginning for Labour. Even in the
conditions of economic expansion following the war, the consensus,
the compromise achieved, was bound to be pulled in different
directions. Mixed economy? All right. But what exact mixture between
nationalised and private industry? A welfare state &#8211; But at what
level should welfare benefits be pitched? And if there was a
worsening in the economic situation and cuts became the order of the
day, how much to cut and in what areas? In foreign policy NATO, the
Atlantic alliance set up after the end of the war, was accepted as
written on tablets of stone. But how far should Britain go in
supporting the United States?</p>

<p>In move of the Tories towards Butskellism also affected the
discussion. Right-wing Labour leaders argued that electoral success d
on winning the voters in the middle by having moderate policies. The
left argued that Labour had to sharpen its differentiation from the
Tories by adopting more distinct socialist policies.</p>

<p>With the economic crisis of 1947 as its background, a bitter
argument took place in the cabinet between April and July over steel
nationalisation. This was the first time that clear differences of
opinion appeared in the cabinet. On the one side Herbert Morrison and
John Wilmot, minister of supply, opposed steel nationalisation; on
the other were Nye Bevan and Hugh Dalton. Although the cabinet did go
ahead with legislation in 1948, the conflict over the issue continued
right down to the end of 1949.</p>

<p>In 1947 the Labour Party adopted a document, <strong>Industry and
Society</strong>, which in practice froze the borders of the public
sector. The time had arrived for &#8216;consolidation&#8217;, it said, going
on to praise private industry: &#8216;under increasingly professional
management, large firms are, on the whole, serving the nation well.&#8217;
Both the left and right in the leadership supported this document
although it did raise some resentment in the party.</p>

<p>Morrison told the 1948 Labour conference:</p>

<p class="quoteb">do not ignore the need, not merely for considering
further public ownership, but for allowing Ministers adequate time to
consolidate, to develop, to make efficient the industries which have
been socialized in the present Parliament ... We must make the
programme as attractive as we can to ourselves, but we must make it
attractive also to public opinion ... <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The constituency delegate who followed Morrison clearly expressed
the unhappiness of the rank and file:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the programme will be attractive to the public, not if it
is something very wishy-washy and watered down but if it is bold and
challenging I want to see in the forefront of our General Election
programme a declaration of faith in Socialism &#8211; not the approach
the Liberal has to nationalization, that when two or three Royal
Commissions have decided that in a particular case, for empirical
reasons, an industry ought to be nationalized, then we will
nationalize it. I want us to say we believe, as economic scientists
and on the grounds of social justice, that the large resources of
production in this country ought to belong to the common people ...
When the present programme of the Labour Government has been
completed some twenty per cent of the industrial and economic life of
this country will be publicly owned. At this speed it will take us 25
years to get to the stage when Socialism predominates ... we are
going too slow ...</p>

<p class="fst">The delegate went on to reject the mixed economy:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I do not believe that it is feasible, as a permanent
basis, for a Socialist Government to control privately-owned
industry. Ownership gives control. The only way in which we can get
control is by getting ownership. <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a></p>

<p class="fst">He was to be disappointed. In April 1949 the party executive
published a draft programme for the next election, <strong>Labour Believes
in Britain</strong>. It was accepted by conference the same year. The list
of industries proposed for nationalisation was water, cement, sugar,
meat-wholesale and Industrial Assurance. This last proposal was later
watered down under pressure from Morrison and Cripps. One delegate in
the 1949 conference could rightly say: &#8216;<strong>Labour Believes in
Britain</strong> reads like a White Paper ... It is certainly not a Red
Paper ... &#8217; <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a></p>

<p>Bevan did his best in his summing-up to reassure the doubters.</p>

<p>In the name of party unity he was quite ecstatic about the
&#8216;wonderful opening speech of Herbert Morrison&#8217;. <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a></p>

<p>Many on the left did not follow Bevan&#8217;s support for <strong>Labour
Believes in Britain</strong>. Ian Mikardo, in a pamphlet titled <strong>The
Second Five Years</strong>, urged the need to nationalise the joint stock
banks and industrial assurance companies, shipbuilding, aircraft,
construction, aero-engines, machine tools, and the assembly branch of
mass produced motor vehicles. Then in January 1950 twelve MPs
published a pamphlet entitled <strong>Keeping Left</strong>, in which they
advocated the public ownership of road haulage, steel, insurance,
cement, sugar and cotton.</p>

<p>Labour won the general election of 1950, but with a very small
majority. None of the measures outlined in <strong>Labour Believes in
Britain </strong>were implemented, save for the commitment to
nationalise steel. Otherwise the whole issue of public ownership was
shelved. In the run-up to the general election of October 1951, the
new party manifesto, <strong>Labour and the New Society</strong>, for the first
time since the war included no candidates for nationalisation save
for steel, as Morrison wanted. The manifesto acceded to Bevan&#8217;s
wish, however, that the possibility of further takeovers be left
open, calling in vague terms for new public enterprises when this
would &#8216;serve the national interest&#8217;. Morrison&#8217;s opposition to
further Nationalisation had won the day. When Bevan spoke in favour
of <strong>Labour and the New Society</strong> at the 1950 annual conference
the left was mute.</p>

<p>Morrison was strongly influenced by his estimate that
nationalisation was an electoral albatross for the Labour Party. From
1948 onwards, and especially after the 1950 general election, he
argued that future Labour victories depended on an appeal to moderate
voters who opposed nationalisation. Even the language of the first
three years of government, itself a retreat from long-held Labour
beliefs, was being abandoned.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A reactionary foreign and defence policy</h4>

<p class="fst">Before coming to office, Labour leaders spoke of a foreign policy
which was radically different to that of the Tories. As Attlee put it
in 1937: &#8216;there is no agreement on foreign policy between a Labour
Opposition and a capitalist government.&#8217; <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a></p>

<p>The most extreme expression of the need for a real socialist
foreign policy was the speech by Denis Healey, then a delegate at the
May 1945 Labour Party Conference, in which he called on Labour to
support the socialist revolution in Western and Central Europe:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the Labour Party should have a clear foreign policy of
its own, which is completely distinct from that of the Tory Party.</p>

<p class="quote">The socialist revolution had already begun in Europe and
was already firmly established in many countries in Eastern and
Southern Europe. The crucial principle of our foreign policy should
be to protect, assist, encourage and aid in every way the Socialist
revolution wherever it appears ... The upper class in every country
are selfish, depraved, dissolute and decadent. These upper classes
look to the British Army and the British people to protect them
against the just wrath of the people who have been fighting
underground against them for the first four years. We must see that
that does not happen. The penalty for entertaining any hesitation
about the support for the revolution would be that Labour would wake
one day to find itself &#8216;running with the Red Flag in front of the
armoured car of Tory imperialism and counter-revolution.&#8217; <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Once Labour took office, socialist euphoria evaporated. On the day
the election results were received, Ernest Bevin announced: &#8216;British
foreign policy will not be altered in any way under the Labour
Government.&#8217; <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a> On becoming foreign
secretary he told the House of Commons: &#8216;The basis of our policy is
in keeping with that worked out by the Coalition Government, in which
I worked in close collaboration with the Right Hon Member for Warwick
and Leamington [Anthony Eden].&#8217; Eden reciprocated: &#8216;&#8220;I cannot
recall one single occasion when there was a difference between us. I
hope I do not embarrass the Foreign Secretary by saying that&#8221; ...
Mr Bevin: &#8220;No&#8221;.&#8217; <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a></p>

<p>Eden&#8217;s memoirs note:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I was in agreement with the aims of [Bevin&#8217;s] foreign
policy and with most that he did, and we met quite frequently. He
would invite me to his room in the House of Commons where we
discussed events informally. In Parliament I usually followed him in
debate and I would have agreed with him more, if I had not been
anxious to embarrass him less. <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a></p>

<p class="fst">James F. Byrnes, the US secretary of state, wrote that &#8216;Britain&#8217;s
stand ... was not altered in the slightest.&#8217; <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the economic plight of Britain, Attlee&#8217;s
government devoted a greater proportion of the GNP to defence than
any other non-Communist nation in the period before the Korean war.</p>

<p class="quoteb">In 1947 British defense expenditures amounted to 9.5 per
cent of GNP, and American expenditures to 6.5 per cent; in 1950 they
amounted to 7.7 per cent, American to 5.9 per cent, and French to 5.0
per cent. Where defense manpower was concerned, it was the same
story: in 1948 Britain had double the percentage of men under arms as
the United States, and in 1950 still more than 50 per cent as much.
<a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Attlee government tried to salvage Britain&#8217;s dwindling world
imperialist role, notwithstanding its decline during the Second World
War. Imperialism had bolstered British capitalism during the latter
decades of the nineteenth century and during the 1930s, but history
could not be repeated. Massive spending on armaments, started by
Attlee and continued by the Tories during the 1950s, only accelerated
the relative decline of British capitalism compared to other
countries. Germany spent very little on armaments, and Japan even
today spends only about 1 per cent of it GNP. While both these
countries were engaged in a high level productive investment in new
factories and new technology, British capitalism wasted resources.</p>

<p>The linchpin of Labour&#8217;s policy was the &#8216;special relationship&#8217;
with the USA. This was the means by which Britain&#8217;s world role was
preserved &#8211; by accepting the position of junior partner to the
Americans in the new world economic and political order. Britain
ceded the job of world policeman to the US, but still maintained
extensive military commitments in certain areas &#8211; including Greece,
Palestine, the Middle East, Singapore and Malaysia. The new
relationship was cemented by Bevin&#8217;s creation of NATO, which was
established in April 1949.</p>

<p>Britain also accepted a subordinate position to the USA in the
world financial field. Sterling was restored as an international
currency &#8211; not, however, as powerful as the dollar.</p>

<p>In March 1946 Attlee became the first prime minister in British
history to implement military conscription in peacetime with the
setting up of National Service. Pressure from the PLP at first
reduced the period of service from the intended eighteen months to
twelve. The brass hats did not like it. As Lord Montgomery, Chief of
the Imperial General Staff, recalled:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In October 1948, we assembled the Military Members of the
Army Council ... and asked them if they were all prepared to resign
in a body, led by me, if anything less than eighteen months National
Service with the Colours was decided upon by the Government. They all
agreed. <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The government capitulated. Like the Curragh mutiny this was a
demonstration that the state machine was not neutral, to be used by
any party that happened to be in office, but was an instrument of the
ruling class.</p>

<p>When the Korean War broke out conscription was increased to two
years. Korea had been partitioned at the end of the Second World War.
The war between north and south began on 25 June 1950. Two days later
the cabinet agreed unanimously to endorse US intervention in support
of the south. <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a> British troops were
immediately sent to assist. When the issue eventually reached the
House of Commons on 5 July, only three Labour MPs voted against the
government action.</p>

<p>The Labour Government also helped to crush risings in Greece,
Malaya and Vietnam.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Indian independence: A shining exception?</h4>

<p>The granting of independence to India seems to run the right-wing
trend of Attlee&#8217;s foreign policy. Labour leader depicted it as a
magnanimous gesture. In fact it was brought about by the revolt of
the Indian navy in February 1946, alongside movements in the military
and air services and massive civil disturbances which led to the
deaths of 223 people in Bombay. <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a>
This made nonsense of what one historian calls &#8216;the legend of magnanimity&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">[In February 1946] the whole of the Navy in India was
immobilized for five days ... In Bombay and Karachi British forces
actually engaged in battle with Indian sailors. It is hardly
conceivable that such a crisis did not have a direct impact on the
attitude of the Labour Party towards independence ... Nehru&#8217;s
biographer ... notes that &#8216;it seems more than a mere coincidence
that the announcement about the British Cabinet Mission was made one
day after the outbreak of the Bombay mutiny&#8217;. <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was the threat of a revolution that forced the hands of the
government. In the words of P.J. Griffiths, leader of the European
Group in the Indian Central Legislative Assembly during 1946: &#8216;India
in the opinion of many was on the verge of a revolution before the
British Cabinet Mission arrived. The Cabinet Mission has at least
postponed if not eliminated the danger.&#8217; <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a>
The respite was brief. Lord Ismay, chief of staff to Mountbatten, the
Viceroy charged with the transfer of power, described the situation a
year later:</p>

<p class="quoteb">India in March, 1947, was a ship on fire in mid-ocean
with ammunition in the hold. By then it was a question of putting out
the fire before it reached the ammunition. There was, in fact, no
option before us but to do what we did. <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Even the editor of the <strong>Daily Mail</strong> admitted that to stay in
India &#8216;it would have needed an occupation force of 500,000 men&#8217; &#8211;
and no such force was could have been made available given Britain&#8217;s
other commitments. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a></p>

<p>Forced out unwillingly from India, Attlee nevertheless made sure
that British capital would not suffer unduly. The 1947 settlement
negotiated by Lord Mountbatten with the leaders of the Indian
Congress Party and the Moslem League was both a retreat for Britain
and a compromise for British imperialism with the capitalists and
landlords of the sub-continent. This included the partition of India
into two states, India and Pakistan, with extremely artificial
boundaries, leading to mass shifts of population, communal bloodbaths
and the wholesale flight of refugees. There many massacres,
especially in the Punjab, with Sikhs and Moslems primarily involved.
Perhaps half a million lost their lives. <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a></p>

<p>Despite the massive human suffering not a penny of British
investment had been sacrificed. Thus the Attlee government was far
more effective in defending British interests in India than the
French were with their prolonged colonial struggle in Indochina and
Algeria, the Dutch in Indonesia, the Belgians in the Congo, or the
Portuguese in Angola and Mozambique.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>South Africa</h4>

<p class="fst">Until this point India had been the touchstone for Labour&#8217;s
attitude to imperialism. Since 1947, however, South Africa has taken
its place. Attlee set the tone for what has been one of the ugliest
features of Labour&#8217;s foreign policy in government.</p>

<p>Richard Ovendale has described Labour&#8217;s reaction to the
Nationalist Party election victory and establishment of apartheid in
1948. In the growing atmosphere of Cold War elsewhere in the world,
the Nationalists in South Africa could be useful allies, being
&#8216;terrified of communism&#8217; and &#8216;in &#8220;complete sympathy&#8221; with
the aims of British foreign policy.&#8217; Admiration was mutual. A
cabinet paper of September 1950 wished to cultivate South Africa&#8217;s
goodwill &#8216;from the general strategic and defence points of view&#8217;
In addition uranium for the nuclear programme, gold for the sterling
area and the hundreds of millions of pounds worth of British
investments in South Africa were powerful inducements towards friendship.</p>

<p>In 1951 Patrick Gordon Walker, Labour secretary of state for
Commonwealth relations reported on South Africa:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Those who argue that because we dislike the Union&#8217;s
Native policy we should ostracise her and have nothing to do with her
completely fail to understand the realities of the situation. Such a
policy would not only gravely harm us in the defence and economic
fields it would also weaken our power to deter South Africa from
foolhardy acts from fear of breaking with us.</p>

<p class="fst">Ovendale concludes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">it was Attlee&#8217;s Labour governments that perceived South
Africa&#8217;s strategic and economic importance for Britain, and the
need to maintain contact to ameliorate the policy of apartheid. They
laid down the fundamentals of British policy towards South Africa
that were, with fluctuations, pursued for the following 30 years. <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Labour and the bomb</h4>

<p class="fst">One of the most remarkable events in the 1945&#8211;51 period must be
the production of the atom bomb. Not only did Attlee introduce the
nuclear arms programme, but he kept it secret from the public, the
trade unions, the party executive, the Parliamentary Labour Party and
most of the cabinet! It seems that only those cabinet ministers on
the secret committee Gen 75, which since 1945 had dealt with
decision-making on atomic energy, had any inkling of the existence of
Britain&#8217;s atomic bomb. <a href="#na" name="fa">[1*]</a> <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a></p>

<p>During the whole period of the 1945&#8211;51 Labour government there
was not a single Commons debate devoted to atomic energy. In the same
six years the subject figured less than ten times on the cabinet
agenda and seven of these were concerned with the two visits Attlee
made to US President Harry Truman in November 1945 and December 1950.
Apart from these:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the Cabinet as a body was completely excluded from all
the major decisions on atomic policy in these years. It took no part
in the decisions to establish a research establishment, to build
piles to produce plutonium, or, later, to build gaseous diffusion
plants to separate uranium 235; no part in the decisions to make and
then test in atomic bomb ... and about the planned place of atomic
bombs in British strategy. <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Not until October 1952, when Britain first publicly tested her own
atomic weapons on the Montebello Islands off the North West
Australian coast, did the decision of the Attlee government become
general knowledge.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Remarkable complacency in the ranks</h4>

<p class="fst">By and large Labour MPs were very placid. In very few cases did a
number of MPs vote against the government. The opposition of the left
inside the Parliamentary Labour Party was sporadic and dominated by
issues of foreign policy and defence. <a href="#nb" name="fb">[2*]</a>
This passivity extended to the party outside parliament.</p>

<p>Throughout the six years of the Attlee government the Labour Party
executive was completely tame. In the words of Bob McKenzie:</p>

<p class="quoteb">not once in the lifetime of the Labour Government of 1945
and 1950 did the NEC give any public indication that it disagreed
with any item of Government ... At each of the conferences during the
period 1946 to 1951 the NEC invariably acted as a watchdog for the
Government; they never once advocated, or were even prepared to
tolerate, a proposal which differed in any significant particular
from the policies of the Labour Government.</p>

<p class="fst">One reason for this was that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Executive of the Party ... is impotent during a
Labour Government, since constitutionally Cabinet Ministers, although
themselves members of the Executive, must not discuss in their
secondary capacity details of what they have done as Privy
Councillors. <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The party executive actually withered through disuse. Whereas in
the 1930s it met on average thirty-five times a year, after 1945 it
managed fewer than twelve meetings a year. <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a>
The idea that the national Labour Party can really control the
parliamentary leaders has always been a nonsense. It is doubly so
when they are in government.</p>

<p>Critics of government policies on the executive probably never
numbered more than four or five of its twenty-seven members. Its
docility led Harold Laski to refuse further membership in 1948, on
the ground that he could operate more effectively as an individual
party member. <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a></p>

<p>The executive was matched by conferences. In <strong>Tribune</strong> Ian
Mikardo pronounced them to be &#8216;as dead as the dodo&#8217;. <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a>
McKenzie furnishes the proof: &#8216;On a total of only nine occasions
during the six party conferences (1946&#8211;51) was the advice of the
NEC rejected by the conference ... <a href="#nc" name="fc">[3*]</a>
<a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a> On the whole, the Attlee
Governments were as nearly immune as any Conservative Govern&shy;ment
can expect to be from outright condemnation by its annual
conference.&#8217; <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a></p>

<p>Strains did eventually appear over foreign policy and the
dislocation caused by the Korean War. Nonetheless the 1950 conference
endorsed Britain&#8217;s involvement in Korea by a huge majority. The
star of the conference was Nye Bevan, who made a passionate plea for
the conference to rally behind the government. Bevan said that that
conference showed a &#8216;greater degree of unity than I have ever known
before in my experience in the Labour Party.&#8217; <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a></p>

<p>This was remarkable in view of the constant skirmishing during the
first MacDonald government and the deep split of the second. Later
Harold Wilson&#8217;s administration would experience great turbulence at
conferences between 1964 and 1970, and there was to be a yawning gulf
between left and right under the Labour governments of 1974&#8211;9.</p>

<p>Because Labour combines class and nation, it is inevitable that
individuals should synthesise them in different ways. Usually the
left emphasises the immediate aspirations of workers, while the right
stresses that a healthy national system is necessary <em>before</em>
workers&#8217; demands can be attended to. There is an in-built tension.
The 1945&#8211;51 government showed that despite this habitual animosity
between left and right, together they form a fundamental unity. Since
Keynesian economics appeared to gratify the claims of the left,
Attlee and the cabinet were able to pursue a very right-wing
reformism without opposition. This was shown by the fate of the <strong>Keep
Left</strong> manifesto and <strong>Tribune</strong>.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A feeble opposition: <em>Keep Left</em></h4>

<p class="fst">In May 1947 <strong>Keep Left</strong> was published by Richard Crossman,
Michael Foot and Ian Mikardo. Another twelve MPs put their names to
this manifesto. Though covering domestic policy, its sharpest
criticism was directed at foreign and defence policy. As always,
reformists are far more radical on issues far from home since these
relate less directly to real domestic class struggle.</p>

<p>The core of the pamphlet was that &#8216;Britain has been driven into
a dangerous dependence on the United States.&#8217; It called for the
abandonment of the &#8216;Tory idea of bolstering up the British Empire
with American dollars and fighting America&#8217;s battle with British
soldiers.&#8217; Britain should &#8216;regain her independence.&#8217; Not strong
enough to do this on her own, she should create a &#8216;third force&#8217;
in the shape of a European Socialist alliance based on Britain and
France. More socialism was needed at home to assist the economy and
avoid dependence on the United States. This demanded more planning to
cut costs of production and thus encourage the export drive. A
synthesis of the national interest and socialism were at the heart of
<strong>Keep Left</strong>.</p>

<p>At little over a year, <strong>Keep Left</strong> holds the record as the
shortest lived left rebellion in the history of Labour: Marshall Aid
from America killed it stone dead. This aid, designed to restore
stable capitalism to war-tom Western Europe, was very popular indeed
Cripps described is as &#8216;an act of grand immediate generosity and
enlightenment.&#8217; <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a> He later stated:
&#8216;Without Marshall Aid something like one and a half million men
might have been thrown out of work for lack of raw materials.&#8217; <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a></p>

<p>Reformists dare not bite the hand that pays for reforms, whatever
its source. The American cash injections of 1946 and 1948 helped pay
for the welfare state and tied Labour Britain firmly to US
imperialist objectives. The price of Labour&#8217;s reformism was an
alliance with international capitalism, and the cold war.</p>

<p>Crossman, one of the authors of <strong>Keep Left</strong>, explained the
impact of the Marshall Plan on his thinking:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I will be frank. My own views about America have changed
a great deal in the last six months. Many members have had a similar
experience. I could not have believed six months ago that a plan of
this sort would have been worked out in detail with as few
conditions. <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus an amendment to the Marshall Plan got short shrift at the
1948 Labour Party conference. <a href="#n83" name="f83">[83]</a></p>

<p>Crossman now wrote <strong>Keep Left</strong>&#8217;s obituary. He put its
demise down to two factors: first the economic austerity policy of
Cripps with which <strong>Keep Left</strong> <em>agreed</em>; second, the
announcement of Marshall Aid. &#8216;Once Cripps took over the economic
front and began serious Socialist planning, and once Ernest Bevin
adopted Western Union [NATO] and began to make it work, it was my
view that the <strong>Keep Left </strong>group had fulfilled its purpose.&#8217; <a href="#n84" name="f84">[84]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4><em>Tribune</em>, loyal guard of the government</h4>

<p class="fst"><strong>Tribune</strong> was for many years the mouthpiece of the Labour
left, or more precisely, of the left in the Parliamentary Labour
Party. Let us see what its attitude was to various planks of the
government&#8217;s policy.</p>

<p><strong>Tribune</strong> was enthusiastic about Stafford Cripps&#8217; austerity
policy and his wage freeze. If anything the measures did not go far
enough. An editorial on the 1948 budget stated: &#8216;So far both the
Government and the TUC have failed to make an adequately bold
approach towards a wages policy ... Sir Stafford Cripps should have
done more.&#8217; <a href="#n85" name="f85">[85]</a></p>

<p>When in October 1949 the government announced massive spending
cuts, <strong>Tribune</strong> asked in an editorial &#8216;Do the Cuts Make Sense?
answered unequivocally, &#8216;Yes&#8217;: &#8216;They have one immediate aim,
and one only &#8211; to enable the country to get the central advantage
of devaluation&#8217;. The government was however criticised&#8217; for not
presenting the cuts in a more understandable and stimulating way.&#8217; <a href="#n86" name="f86">[86]</a></p>

<p>Strikes did not find favour with <strong>Tribune</strong>. An editorial in
June 1948 declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>Tribune</strong> believes that the dock strike is an
unmitigated calamity. We think that the dockers were wrong to strike
and that they could only do injury to themselves by persistence in
this course. We dearly hope that by the time we go to press the men
will have returned to work&#8217;. <a href="#n87" name="f87">[87]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When a State of Emergency was declared in July 1949 with the aim
of breaking a national dock strike, <strong>Tribune</strong> had this to say:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the Government has now staked its authority on the
success of the emergency powers, and we must hope that the dockers
will quickly accept the verdict and return to work ... We hope they
will quickly realise that it is only the Communist and Tory enemies
of trade union rights who stand to profit by their action. <a href="#n88" name="f88">[88]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Many other examples could be cited.</p>

<p>If once you mistake economic planning under capitalism for
socialism, such confusion is inevitable. As <strong>Tribune</strong> showed,
ultimately such reformist delusions lead those who hold them to turn
against the workers.</p>

<p><strong>Tribune</strong> again and again commended union leaders for
supporting wage restraint, complaining only that the policy was too
loose. What was necessary was a legally binding incomes policy.
Writing on the White Paper on Personal Incomes it stated: &#8216; ... the
White Paper sits precariously on the fence between free wage
bargaining and Government intervention in wage regulations.&#8217; <a href="#n89" name="f89">[89]</a>
The latter should be imposed against what Mikardo called the
prevailing &#8216;wage anarchy&#8217; <a href="#n90" name="f90">[90]</a>: &#8216;It
really is idle to talk about planned economy with an unplanned wages
sector ... That revolution won&#8217;t be easy to accomplish, but without
it we have no real hope of Socialism in our time.&#8217; <a href="#n91" name="f91">[91]</a></p>

<p>Together with government ministers and trade union bureaucrats,
<strong>Tribune</strong> indulged in the witch-hunting of Communists for
&#8216;inciting&#8217; strikes. Attlee&#8217;s decision to remove Communists (and
fascists) from certain civil service posts in the spring of 1948 was endorsed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">[Communists] owe allegiance to another State ... They do
not accept the premises of democracy ... To ask that Ministers should
be prepared to trust Communist Party members with security secrets
seems absurd. <a href="#n92" name="f92">[92]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In similar vein <strong>Tribune</strong> supported the ban on Communist
holding office in the TGWU in 1949.</p>

<p><strong>Tribune</strong> could stand reality on its head to defend the
government. When Ernest Bevin&#8217;s maiden speech as foreign secretary
emphasised the continuity of his policy with that of the war time
coalition, <strong>Tribune</strong> wrote: &#8216;Ernest Bevin&#8217;s speech in the
Commons last week marked a turning point which future historians
might well describe as the moment at which Britain broke the
continuity of her foreign policy.&#8217; <a href="#n93" name="f93">[93]</a></p>

<p><strong>Tribune</strong> criticised only details. On the main issues &#8211;
NATO, Marshall Aid, National Service, the response to the Russian
blockade of Berlin, the Korean war &#8211; it was in complete agreement
with the government.</p>

<p>On NATO, for example, <strong>Tribune</strong> said: &#8216;it certainly
improves the chance [of peace] because it makes aggression against
any of the member states more dangerous for the aggressor.&#8217; <a href="#n94" name="f94">[94]</a>
This was too much for Ian Mikardo, who resigned from the editorial
board. He could not stand the transformation of the paper from a
fellow-travelling broadsheet of Moscow in the 1930s to being a shadow
of Washington. In contrast Nye Bevan backed NATO fully: &#8216;I never
have had any doubt &#8211; that Western Europe is perfectly entitled to
form whatever alignments and coalitions, and take whatever measures
it wishes for its own defence.&#8217; <a href="#n95" name="f95">[95]</a></p>

<p>When the House of Commons voted on the establishment of NATO on 12
May 1949, Churchill had a field day. Not one <strong>Tribune</strong> stalwart
had voted against. He recalled that immediately after his famous cold
war speech, in which he had coined the phrase &#8216;iron curtain&#8217;, 105
MPs moved a motion of censure against him. Where were they now? &#8216;I
do not see them all here today ... we have got about a hundred
[converts] in a bunch, so far as I can make out.&#8217; <a href="#n96" name="f96">[96]</a></p>

<p><strong>Tribune</strong> not only supported the introduction of National
Service but with little disagreement wanted its selective extension
to two and a half years. <a href="#n97" name="f97">[97]</a> When it
came to the Berlin blockade, Bevan urged the cabinet to send tanks
across the Russian zone of Germany to back up the Western airlift.
<a href="#n98" name="f98">[98]</a> When Harry Truman, who had ordered
the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, was re-elected president of
the USA at the end of 1948, <strong>Tribune</strong> was ecstatic &#8216;Salute to
America! ... We have no hesitation in hailing the sensational
Democratic triumph at the polls as a victory for the common people
all over the world. <a href="#n99" name="f99">[99]</a></p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Korean War, <strong>Tribune</strong> came out firmly
on the side of the United States, whose action:</p>

<p class="quoteb">demonstrated that there is no possibility of Communist
aggression succeeding by reason of Western appeasement. The West has
shown that it has preferred to fight, if need be, and that is a
lesson that will not be lost on the Russians. <a href="#n100" name="f100">[100]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When the American army was doing well in the field, <strong>Tribune</strong>
argued that it should not stop at the 38th Parallel, the border of
North and South Korea, but should go on to unite the whole country. <a href="#n101" name="f101">[101]</a></p>

<p>At the same time <strong>Tribune</strong> waxed enthusiastic about the
British Empire:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We want to stay in Africa both for our own purposes and
in the interests of the African peoples ... Africa offers huge
natural resources which can be exploited for the benefit of Britain
and the world ... We do not need to apologize for our mission in
Africa. Whatever the reason which took our forebears there, we must
stay. <a href="#n102" name="f102">[102]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In fact one of the charges <strong>Tribune</strong> laid at the door of the
Tories was that they &#8216;neglected the Empire.&#8217; <a href="#n103" name="f103">[103]</a>
Nationalism was the paper&#8217;s dominant obsession.</p>

<p>Michael Foot chooses as Bevan&#8217;s outstanding feature that he
spoke about Great Britain: &#8216;he always used the &#8220;Great&#8221; long
after most others had abandoned it.&#8217; <a href="#n104" name="f104">[104]</a>
For example, in a speech on 4 July 1948 Bevan said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The eyes of the world are turning to Great Britain. We
now have the moral leadership of the world, and before many years we
shall have people coming here as to a modem Mecca, learning from us
in the twentieth century as they learnt from us in the seventeenth
century. <a href="#n105" name="f105">[105]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In his speech of resignation from the government Bevan stated:
&#8216;There is only one hope for mankind, and that hope remains in this
little island.&#8217; <a href="#n106" name="f106">[106]</a> Foot, quoting
these words, adds: &#8216;He would never allow the Tories to purloin the
patriotic argument.&#8217; <a href="#n107" name="f107">[107]</a> Marx&#8217;s
words that &#8216;workers have no country&#8217; were a sealed book for Bevan
and Foot.<br/>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p class="fst">History has been kind to Attlee. In the midst of today&#8217;s mass
unemployment, privatisation and welfare cuts, his tenure in office
seems a paradise by comparison. <a href="#nd" name="fd">[4*]</a></p>

<p>Yet the real legacy of 1945&#8211;51, like so much in Labour&#8217;s
history, is deeply paradoxical. After only twenty months in office,
the weakness of British capitalism, its dependence on the US and the
massive burden of imperialism put an end to the government aggressive
reformism. Its final collapse in 1951 was rooted in the same causes,
this time sharpened by the impact of the Korean War On foreign
affairs, nuclear issues, and the suppression of strikes Labour had
behaved like its capitalist rivals, and sometimes with more effect.</p>

<p>On the other hand the party kept its popularity with workers high.
In forty-three by-elections it lost only one seat! Furthermore the
October 1951 general election gave Labour the highest poll ever
achieved by one party &#8211; 13,948,605 votes &#8211; 48.8 per cent of the
total votes cast. Only the vagaries of the electoral system gave the
Tories a majority in parliament. Notwithstanding austerity and
rationing at home, and wars overseas, Labour kept its support. How
can we explain this?</p>

<p>First of all the economic difficulties were viewed by the mass of
the people as a consequence of war rather than government
mismanagement. Secondly, the existence of full employment,
contrasting so strongly with the 1930s, served as proof that the
government kept its promises. Finally, as the level of industrial
militancy was low compared with the period after the First World War,
the Labour government demonstrated success in making the transition
from war to peace. And to many, the reforms granted to workers were
the main reason for the social peace.</p>

<p>Another striking feature of the time was that although Labour had
acted as it always does in government &#8211; as the manager of
capitalism &#8211; the left were applauding this loudly. Again, how was
this done?</p>

<p>MacDonald had had the excuse that he led only minority governments
to explain his behaviour as prime minister. Attlee had no such alibi.
Instead he grasped the nettle, and dispensed with even a verbal
commitment to the ending of capitalism. He got away without trouble
because of the world boom. This was one of those increasingly rare
moments during which British capitalism was not in crisis. So Attlee
could perform what is usually an impossible feat of magic &#8211; to
satisfy the ruling class without alienating working-class supporters.
For once the reformist project worked. So great was expansion that
the bosses&#8217; desire to accumulate could be satisfied while something
was left over to sweeten the system for the workers. <em>This was
not a situation likely to be repeated</em>. Attlee&#8217;s government is
likely to remain the highest pinnacle of reformist practice.</p>

<p>This brings us to the question of how many reforms were gained by
having Labour rather than the Tories in office.</p>

<p>The Tories would not have nationalised steel. But in any case,
Labour ignored its 1945 manifesto commitment to do so until January
1951, and steel was returned to private hands after the Tory election
victory in October. Apart from this, as later developments showed,
the Tories understood the need to maintain an infrastructure and a
productive, well-educated workforce. If we give Labour the benefit of
the doubt we can say that their reforms went a <em>bit</em> further.
But that is all. As comparisons with countries without reformist
governments show, not too much can be made of the difference between
Labour and Tory welfare.</p>

<p>Indeed, it can be argued that in many ways the Labour government
of 1945&#8211;51 was an obstacle to any but the most limited reforms.
Under Attlee capitalists conceded as much and no more than they felt
like. We know that they were not afraid of Labour&#8217;s parliamentary
majority. Neither 600 people sitting on benches and emitting hot air,
nor &#8216;popular opinion&#8217; has ever prevented capitalists from
fighting tooth and nail to defend their interests. Bosses are,
however, afraid of the power of the working class. By 1944 workers
had been showing a capacity for action and self-activity not seen
since before the General Strike. Yet it was precisely this force that
Labour successfully shackled through the union bureaucracy and, where
that failed, by using troops as strikebreakers.</p>

<p>The political results of Attlee&#8217;s government lasted beyond 1951.
The Labour leadership had tied itself more closely to the ruling
class than ever before. Worse still, it had led many of its most
active supporters more or less to renounce the idea of overcoming
capitalism (even by gradual stages) and to accept not only that the
system was here to stay, but that it should be consciously nurtured.
For the minority who considered themselves socialists, the result was
disastrous. The Labour left was reduced to a pathetic rump and the
space for revolutionary socialist ideas was cut to a minimum. Looked
at in this way, the ruling class got the best of the deal</p>

<p>However the picture was not so simple.</p>

<p>Because Labour was in office, <em>the language of consensus came to be
expressed in reformist terms</em>. This was of long-term importance.
Many of the gains of 1945&#8211;51 were not especially due to Labours
efforts, yet the period planted the idea in the working class that
workers had <em>a right</em> to a job, <em>a right</em> to decent
housing, and <em>a right</em> to health. It was society&#8217;s duty to
provide them. Other countries, such as Germany and the US, may have
delivered a similar level of reforms since 1945, but, because they
lacked the veneer of reformist ideology provided by a Labour Party,
they were not seen as a <em>social duty</em> in the same way. British
workers gained only the crumbs from the rich pickings of the booming
world economy, but they did not see them as crumbs, but as theirs <em>as
of right</em> &#8211; and this stored up a potential for resistance when
those crumbs were withdrawn. Even today this potential, around issues
such as the health service, is a long way from being exhausted.</p>
<p>Therefore the assault on the post-war consensus mounted since the
mid-1970s (first by Wilson and Callaghan and more radically by
Thatcher) is a reactionary attack on reformist consciousness, which,
because it partially represents working-class aspirations, must be resisted.</p>

<p>Even during the Attlee government, the reformist consensus was
shown to be built on unstable foundations. The reforming zeal of the
government had more or less run out by 1948, and still the mole of
history went on working. The increasing suppression of unofficial
strikes, the bouts of inflation especially following the devaluation
of the pound in 1949, the outbreak of the Korean War, the cuts, all
caused a degree of disaffection among politically advanced workers
that was reflected in the Labour Party.</p>

<p>The growing threat that the Korean War could escalate into a far
wider conflict, and rising witch-hunts against Communists, jolted the
constituency parties to revolt against the national executive from
1952 onwards, and spurred wide rank and file support for Bevan in the unions.</p>

<p>Attlee&#8217;s government had not ushered in socialism. Its real
triumph lay in its steering of British capitalism through a period of
stress in the aftermath of the Second World War, and in assisting the
USA to stabilise capitalism the world over.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#fa" name="na">1*.</a> A key role in Gen 75 was played by
Sir John Anderson, an Independent Conservative sitting on the
opposition front bench. In January 1947 Gen 75 was converted into Gen
163, a secret cabinet committee consisting of Attlee, Bevin,
Morrison, A.V. Alexander (minister of defence), J. Wilmot (minister of
supply, later replaced by Strauss), and Lord Addison, the Dominions
secretary. It was this committee that decided, in the month it was
established, to make the bomb. Expenditure on atomic research and
development was concealed under other items.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fb" name="nb">2*.</a> Here some of the few examples in
which this occurred:</p>

<ul>
<li>On 13 December 1945, twenty-three Labour MPs voted against
the government&#8217;s acceptance of a US loan.</li>

<li>On 18 November 1946, forty-five Labour MPs voted against
the introduction of peacetime conscription.</li>

<li>On 7 May 1947 an amendment to the Conscription Bill stating
that no person subject in the Act &#8216;shall be required to take duty
in aid of the civil power in connection with a trade dispute&#8217; got
the support of eleven Labour MPs.</li>

<li>On 12 March 1949, four Labour MPs voted against the
ratification of NATO (and about 100 abstained).</li>

<li>On 16 May 1949, forty-five Labour MPs voted against the
Ireland Bill.</li>

<li>On 13 July 1949, when emergency powers were introduced to
deal with the London dock strike, four Labour MPs voted against.</li>

<li>On 25 March 1959, when Seretse Khama, Chief of Botswana,
was banished from his country by the government for marrying a white
woman and thus antagonising the South African government, seven
Labour MPs voted against.</li>

<li>On 2 May 1951, five Labour MPs voted against the imposition
of dental and optical charges.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><a href="#fc" name="nc">3*.</a> McKenzie records:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;in 1946 the conference passed four resolutions which were opposed by the NEC ...
The 1947 conference overrode the advice of Aneurin Bevan, the
Minister of Health and a member of the NEC, by passing a resolution
favouring the abolition of tied cottages. The same conference
overwhelmingly insisted on adopting a resolution favouring equal pay
for equal work for women despite a plea from the NEC that the
resolution should be withdrawn. The 1948 conference renewed the
demand for the abolition of tied cottages, again overriding Aneurin
Bevan and the NEC; and the same conference passed a resolution
opposing &#8220;any reduction or withdrawal of food or clothing subsidies
...&#8221; During the conferences held in the three year 1949&#8211;51
inclusive, the Executive&#8217;s advice was rejected on only one issue
involving ... food distribution ... This ... apart, the NEC had not
the slightest difficulty in restraining the conference from taking
action which would in any way embarrass the Labour Government.&#8217; <a href="#n77">[77]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fd" name="nd">4*.</a> It has not always been the case.
When memories were still fresh, both right and left found things they
objected to, although this never amounted to a full-scale attack. The
right blamed the government for its cloth-cap image and too close
identification with obsolete shibboleths such as nationalisation. The
left pointed to its failure to capture the commanding heights of the
economy, and its capitulation to big business and the cold war.</p>
