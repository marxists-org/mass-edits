<h1>4. Riding the Post-War Storm</h1>

<br/>
<h4>Did Labour prevent a British revolution?</h4>

<p class="fst">THE ARMISTICE in November 1918 saw simultaneous revolutionary
outbreaks in Finland, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Bavaria. Even in
victorious imperialist states massive class struggles erupted.</p>
<p>At that moment reformists threw all efforts into strangling the
spirit of revolution. Their methods were similar, though in Britain
the Labour leaders never had to resort to military repression as did
their their counterparts in Germany&#8217;s SPD. As Rosa Luxemburg put it
two weeks before her murder by the German equivalents of Henderson
and MacDonald: &#8216;the banner of &#8220;socialism&#8221; serves merely as a
fig leaf for the decent veiling of a counter-revolutionary policy.&#8217;
<a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> In some cases reformists were
catapulted into government, in others they were not. But as the newly
formed Third &#8211; or Communist &#8211; International pointed out, &#8216;the
Social Democrats obstruct the actual development of the revolution by
rendering, <em>whether as members of the administration</em> or <em>as
members of the opposition</em>, all possible assistance in restoring
the equilibrium of the bourgeois state.&#8217; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p>The situation in Britain was not essentially different from
abroad. If the Labour Party ever really intended to lead the struggle
for socialism, this surely was the moment. The capitalist enemy was
at its weakest, the workers at their strongest. Army mutinies began
to disintegrate the physical force of the state and workers struck in
vast numbers. Even the police unionised and stopped work. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a>
Unrest leaked in 1919 when, excluding mining, as many days were lost
through strike action as during the whole of 1911&#8211;14. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Far from taking advantage of the state&#8217;s weakness. Labour
declared its devoted loyalty. Clynes, for example, told MPs he had
always opposed police unions <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> and
Henderson went so far as to claim:</p>

<p class="quoteb">if one thing more than another has kept down the
revolutionary spirit in recent years in this country it is the fact
that labour has had the power to express its grievances upon the
floor of this House. I believe that the coming of a Labour party into
this House, even in limited numbers, has done that one thing. It has
provided the brake, as it were, upon any desire upon the part of the
extremists to go lengths industrially that they might have been
disused to go if there had not been this method of giving expression
to grievances. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> <a href="#na" name="fa">[1*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This assertion of Labour as the chief bulwark against revolution
deserves careful consideration. On one level it was false, just as in
1911&#8211;14 Labour appeared irrelevant to workers&#8217; mass
extra-parliamentary activity. The advanced workers were as hostile to
Labour&#8217;s methods as ever. They looked to the traditions of rank and
file struggle and to the formation of a revolutionary Communist Party
patterned on Bolshevism. As Chanie Rosenberg puts it in the
conclusion to her book on 1919: &#8216;There is one permanent feature of
the British scene that has hardly been mentioned. That is the Labour
Party ... [It] was not to be seen.&#8217; <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a>
This seems flatly to contradict Henderson&#8217;s claim. What was the
truth?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The shifting centre of gravity</h4>

<p class="fst">Not since 1905 had the Labour Party been as impotent in
parliamentary terms as it was after the December 1918 &#8216;Coupon&#8217;
Election. Few parliaments have been more out of time with long term
trends than the Lloyd George Coalition. Voting was held within days
of &#8216;victory&#8217; hitting the last gasp of patriotic hysteria. The
characteristic slogans were &#8216;Hang the Kaiser&#8217; and &#8216;Make Germany
Pay&#8217;. This made any taint of pacifism an electoral liability.
Nonetheless Labour received 2.2 million votes, or 24 per cent of the poll.</p>

<p>The Tories and Lloyd George Liberals who shared the &#8216;Coupon&#8217;
formed a solid factional block of 53 Coalition MPs. They confronted
an opposition of just 60 Labour MPs and 25 Free Liberals, led by
Asquith. Labour&#8217;s best performers were defeated because of their
pacifism or through bad luck. With MacDonald, Snowden, and even
Henderson out there were only three ILP MPs among fifty trade
unionists, half of them miners. In the PLP the stolid Scots miner
Willie Adamson took the helm, shortly to be replaced by Clynes,
himself no firebrand. As Allen Hutt put it: &#8216;Great things were
toward in the country, but they found neither reflection nor
inspiration in the activities of the Parliamentary Party.&#8217; <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>
Clearly Labour did not prevent a revolution by the brilliance of its
parliamentary efforts.</p>

<p>Yet it still added its voice to the anti-Bolshevik chorus. For
example, H.N. Brailsford, a leading ILP intellectual, described the
October 1917 Revolution as &#8216;reckless and uncalculating folly&#8217;.
<a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a> Clynes fulminated about Bolshevism
being &#8216;a disease ... of this country and other countries as well.&#8217;
<a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> In true Christian fashion Snowden
wrote that workers&#8217; power was &#8216;a treacherous mirage ... Better
continue to suffer under domination and oppression than gain economic
power through blood and slaughter. For what shall it profit us if we
gain the material world and lose our own souls?&#8217; <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>Labour strenuously attacked domestic subversion. Thomas warned the
Commons against the &#8216;large and growing body of organised Labour
outside which does not believe in political action [by which he meant
parliamentary action] ... It is a method which I am daily at war
against.&#8217; <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a> Henderson &#8216;deplored&#8217;
strikes and claimed &#8216;I have done as much as any man alive to
prevent strikes.&#8217; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> He was not
very effective, as strikes erupted on an un-precedented scale.</p>
<p>This suggests that labour was not the bulwark against revolution
that Henderson claimed. However a closer analysis of events shows
reformism must never be discounted. <em>The labour bureaucracy has two
aspects &#8211; the Labour Party and the trade union officials.</em> In
1919 union bureaucrats were the chief obstacle to revolution because
of their influence over the heart of the class struggle &#8211; workers
at the point of production. As Cramp of the NUR wrote in June 1919:
&#8216;we find that the centre of gravity is passing from the House of
Commons to the Headquarters of the great Trade Unions.&#8217; <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a>
Shinwell was more explicit, telling the 1919 TUC: &#8216;this huge
Congress of labour assesses as much capacity and more creative genius
than the ... mediocrities assembled at Westminster.&#8217; <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless the Labour Party played a tremendously important role
as the bureaucracy&#8217;s political auxiliary and the alibi for their
actions. Labour was, as Desmond put it, officialdom&#8217;s &#8216;hidden
hand&#8217;. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a> It complemented the
efforts of the trade union bureaucracy, just as in periods of Labour
government, the bureaucracy assists in the implementation of policies
of wage restraint and so on. This is borne out by a study of the key
sectors of engineering, mining and the railways.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Three disputes</h4>

<p class="fst">For a variety of reasons, there was no organised and conscious
revolutionary current involved in any of these disputes. Though the
potential for revolutionaries was probably greater than in 1889 or
1911-14 they left the field free for reformism. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p>In the engineers&#8217; strike for a 40-hour week on Clydeside,
Shinwell, a leading members of the ILP, was the most prominent
figure. Was this Labour leading the industrial struggle forward?
Alas, no. His involvement as president of the Trades Council
consisted of confining the action. Despite his efforts the strike
culminated in street fighting, police baton charges and the military
occupation of Glasgow. Shinwell paid with a five-month jail sentence.
But as Maxton informed the 1919 ILP Conference: &#8216;no doubt readers
of the general press would have gathered the impression that the men
who took part in this trouble in Glasgow were merely out to create
trouble. Shinwell ... so far from being an inciting factor in the
whole of the forty-hour movement, was there all the time as a
restraining element among the strikers. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> <a href="#nb" name="fb">[2*]</a></p>

<p>The miners and railwaymen were a still greater threat. Here the
state dared not attack directly but depended on reformist officials
to disarm the movement. As government ministers admitted: &#8216;Trade
Union organisation was the only thing between us and anarchy&#8217;, the
problem being that sometimes the &#8216;trade union was not highly enough
developed to make its branch secretaries fall into line with Head
Office.&#8217; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>Robert Smillie was the miners&#8217; leader, an ILP member of long
standing, an old ally of Keir Hardie and a confirmed reformist. He
was proud &#8216;to be the champion defeated Parliamentary candidate of
the country ... Seven and a half unsuccessful elections stand to my
credit &#8211; or discredit.&#8217; <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a> <a href="#nc" name="fc">[3*]</a></p>

<p>The miners demanded a 80 per cent wage rise, two hours reduction
in the working day <em>and nationalisation</em> under joint
worker/owner control. Concessions were feasible over wages and
conditions (wartime super-profits made sure of that), but the issue
of nationalisation was a tremendous political threat. If granted it
meant the working class could overcome the express wishes of the
coal-owners, who were now desperate to end state interference.
Nationalisation that was forced by mass struggle <em>from below</em>
would not have been the Fabian version but the prelude to open class
warfare. At a celebrated meeting with Lloyd George, the officials
were told what was at stake:</p>

<p class="quoteb">if you carry out your threat and strike, then you will
defeat us ... [But its] very success will precipitate a
constitutional crisis of the first importance. For, if a force arises
in the state which is stronger than the State itself, then it must be
ready to take on the functions of the State ... Gentlemen, have you
considered, and if you have, are you ready?</p>

<p class="fst">After that interview Smillie made this famous comment: &#8216;From
that moment on we were beaten and we knew we were&#8217;. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a>
He was not beaten industrially, he was beaten by his reformist
<em>politics</em>. As Trotsky put it &#8216;even in the minds of
&#8220;socialists&#8221; the fetishism of bourgeois legality [forms] that
ideal inner policeman.&#8217; <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a> When the
real policemen were about to strike, the existence of ideological
ones was crucial to the system.</p>

<p>Smillie&#8217;s acceptance of the bourgeois state did not mean handing
over negotiations to the Labour Party. As leader of an organisation
which played a direct role in the daily working conditions and
earnings of the miners, he assessed more direct influence than the
party. The promise of an election five years hence would not silence
the militants but a Royal Commission <em>now</em> might.</p>

<p>Smillie did not leap at the government offer of a commission
chaired by Lord Sankey. As a sincere reformist, he wanted
nationalisation and was not sure he could stall his members with a
commission. It took all the guile of Sidney Webb to convince him.
Beatrice Webb&#8217;s diary records: &#8216;Sidney found Smillie depressed
with a cold and the feeling of responsibility ... he wanted the
miners to go straight into the fight and win. Sidney reasoned in
favour of accepting the commission ... but Smillie doubted whether he
could get his delegates to go that far in meeting the government.&#8217;
<a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a> Webb clinched his arguments by
suggesting equal representation for employers and miners (a far
better ratio than the 6:1 proportion of Coalition to Labour MPs
produced by bourgeois democracy in parliament, though hardly
reflecting the true balance of one owner to several hundred miners).</p>

<p>To give the Sankey Commission extra democratic gloss it was for
the first time instituted by Act of Parliament. The establishment of
the Sankey Coal Commission was one of the great turning points in
labour history, for it delayed indefinitely, a supreme opportunity to
challenge ruling-class power. Smillie later explained his motives:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We could have enforced [nationalisation] at that time by
our industrial strength ... But there is another way, a way that does
not need industrial force. It is by putting a Labour Government in
power.&#8217; <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The railway strike was the next major crisis, but this time the
union leaders as Jimmy Thomas, the epitome of the right-wing
bureaucrat. Though a leading minister in the first two Labour
governments, he claimed publicly not to be a socialist! <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a>
Thomas could not prevent a railway strike breaking out in September
1919 but he managed to end it within nine days.</p>

<p>For Thomas the primacy of nation over class was much more explicit
than with Smillie. In a speech on <em>Railwaymen and Citizenship</em>
he echoed Lloyd George&#8217;s words directly:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Our union is the strongest in the country. We can demand
that unless such and such a thing is done, we can paralyse the
community ...</p>

<p class="quote">[But] however strong and powerful we may be ...
Citizenship has a stronger claim than any sectional interest.</p>
<p>To complete this hymn to reformism he added the bureaucrat&#8217;s
catechism:</p>

<p class="quote">there were two dangers &#8211; people who could not read the
signs of the times, reactionaries ... Equally was there the danger of
those who believed that we could revolutionise by industrial trouble
or introduce what was called the Russian method ... Both must be
fought. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Smillie and Thomas represented opposite viewpoints within the
union bureaucracy, but the net effect of their actions was the same &#8211;
by the autumn of 1919 the revolutionary opportunity had passed.</p>

<p>There is a theory which states that when workers move in a
revolutionary direction they will turn to the Labour Party and remake
it. 1919 proved this to be arrant nonsense. Even the most left-wing
section &#8211; the ILP &#8211; stood entirely on the sidelines. Its
historian writes that the ILP &#8216;displayed only the most casual
interest in trade union affairs, neither the <strong>Leicester Pioneer</strong>
Bradford Pioneer having industrial correspondents, and little better
was the <strong>Labour Leader</strong> with a trade union column only once a
month.&#8217; <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a> Indeed, the Labour Party
was totally irrelevant as <em>an organisation</em>.</p>

<p>However, when we consider the Labour Party <em>as a body of
reformist ideas</em> the picture is quite different. In 1919 the
legacy of a centralised war economy and strong feelings of workers&#8217;
solidarity combined to make all disputes a state issue. Unlike the
normal run of bargaining, union officials could not merely balance
the forces of one section of workers against the individual
capitalist, because every strike had political repercussions. While
the impotent rump of 60 MPs had no authority, <em>the ideas of
reformism were an absolutely invaluable weapon in the hands of the bureaucracy</em>.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Direct action &#8211; threat or opportunity?</h4>

<p class="fst">By 1920 the revolutionary mood had receded though mass pressure
was still very strong. This gave the leaders some limited scope for
airing their differences. The &#8216;direct action&#8217; debate must be seen
in this context. Without a revolutionary current to make the
officials turn their rhetoric into deeds, or exorcise the vacuity of
their words, what was said never rose above posturing.</p>

<p>The trouble spots were mines nationalisation and international
affairs. Smillie was the chief exponent of the left view. It was
impossible to tell whether he made militant speeches merely to
contain the movement, or to harness mass action for limited ends. His
words contained both tendencies. First came a recognition of opportunities:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We are the best organised force in the world [and]
sufficiently strong with the Government of the day to make it do
anything ... in justice to the workers. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Then fear of losing control:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It would be safer for the Labour Movement of this country
to meet with the Trade Union movement, and calmly and
constitutionally discuss the question and decide upon action, than
wait until a revolution breaks out. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> <a href="#nd" name="fd">[4*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Proposals for union-led direct action gave Labour and parliament a
secondary role. John Bromley of the rail drivers explained why:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Were they going to ... wait another four years? They
would be sacked ... They were told they had not a majority [of
voters]. Could any man or woman there point to any progressive
movement in the world that had waited for the majority to bring it
about? Was there any Trade Union leader who would say that any good
movement or reform in Trade Unionism had been brought about by the
majority? <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The counter-arguments from Thomas, Clynes, Henderson and the right
were based on the idea that &#8216;the nearer we get to power the further
we should recede from any advocacy of violent methods.&#8217; <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a>
If direct action were used &#8216;we may as well abolish the Labour Party
and the whole political machinery at once ... The two things are
absolutely irreconcilable.&#8217; <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> If
they coerced the present government what would happen when Labour won
office, &#8216;were they going to concede to every other or any other
class the right they were claiming?&#8217; <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a>
They had no right to strike politically: &#8216;You can strike against
employers, but on [political] questions the place for action is the
ballot-box.&#8217; <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a> Summing it all up
was McGurk, Chairman of the 1919 Labour Conference: &#8216;We are either
constitutionalists or we are not constitutionalists ... we believe in
the efficacy of the political weapon ... or why do we have a Labour
Party?&#8217; <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>

<p>In the set-piece debates of the Triple Alliance, TUC and Labour
Party, the direct actionists won majorities more than once, but their
bluster proved empty. Thus when the government went back on its
promise to honour the Sankey Commission&#8217;s findings every excuse was
invented to delay action. Once the danger of a strike had passed the
sop of a &#8216;Mines for the Nation&#8217; campaign was offered: It
consisted of &#8216;intensive political propaganda in preparation for a
General Election.&#8217; <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a> The party
paid little attention, which caused campaign organisers to complain
of &#8216;the impossibility of ... securing the services of ... many of
the Party&#8217;s front-rank platform speakers.&#8217; <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p>Prospects for direct action were brighter on international issue.
Trotsky wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In the British labour movement international questions
have always been a path of least resistance for the &#8216;leaders&#8217;. In
regarding international issues as a sort of safety valve for the
radical mood of the masses [the] leaders are prepared to bow to a
certain degree to revolution [elsewhere] only the more surely to take
revenge on the questions of the domestic class struggle. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p class="fst">British repression in Ireland was a possible candidate for direct
action. Labour&#8217;s position, as might be expected from a
Liberal-influenced Party, was for Gladstonian Home Rule. But God
forbid that the Irish should do anything about their own liberation!
<strong>Forward</strong> declared the Easter 1916 Rising: &#8216;a tragedy of
unrelieved gloom. Call it madness, or badness or both.&#8217; <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a>
<strong>Socialist Review</strong> was worse: &#8216;We do not approve armed
rebellion at all ... Nor do we plead the rebels&#8217; cause ... Nor do
we complain against the Government for having opposed and suppressed
aimed rebellion by armed force.&#8217; <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a>
So much for ILP pacifism!</p>

<p>Yet Labour&#8217;s position was not purely reactionary. The ability of
reformists to mix class and nation is a constant source of wonder.
<strong>Socialist Review&#8217;s</strong> article quoted above ended by saying:
&#8216;what we ... protest against is not the suppression of the
rebellion by military measures, but the needless harshness and
excess.&#8217; But this hardly provided the springboard for fighting
government use of the Black and Tans in 1920.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Labour&#8217;s most daring hour</h4>

<p class="fst">The Russian issue was different. In May 1920, largely through the
agitation of revolutionaries such as Harry Pollitt, East London
dockers prevented the shipping of munitions on <em>The Jolly George</em>
to help Poland fight the Bolsheviks. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a>
On 4 August 1920 the prime minister, Lloyd George, announced his
intention to send British troops to back the Poles. A wave of
revulsion stirred the war-weary population, as &#8216;all the middle
class pacifists and many middle class taxpayers&#8217; and even the City
welcomed attempts to prevent conflict. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>

<p>Confident they had public opinion as well as militant workers
behind them, the Parliamentary Labour Party, the party&#8217;s national
executive and the TUC met to form a fifteen-strong Council of Action
on 9 August. Four days later a national conference of trade union and
Labour branch delegates was held. Some unbelievable speeches were delivered.</p>

<p>Thomas called for a general strike: &#8216;No Parliamentary effort
could do what we are asking you to do ... If this resolution is to be
given effect to, it means a challenge to the whole Constitution of
the country (cheers).&#8217; The chairman of the Labour executive went
on: &#8216;we may be compelled to do things that will cause them to
abdicate. (Perhaps) we will be compelled, even against all
Constitutions, to chance whether we cannot do something to take the
country into our own hands for our own people.&#8217; <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a></p>

<p>Even Ramsay MacDonald welcomed direct action because &#8216;confidence
in Parliament is forfeited&#8217;. <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a>
This was the same man who had written: &#8216;to degrade in the
imagination of the people <em>even a bad House of Commons</em> is a
crime &#8211; a most heinous crime for Socialists&#8217; <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a></p>

<p>In the event the government backed away from war. We cannot know
whether a general strike would have been called, but there is no
reason to suppose it was absolutely ruled out. Bureaucratically-led
mass strikes are not unknown. Thus in 1920 the German Social
Democrats and union leaders launched an effective general strike to
defeat the Kapp Putsch against the Weimar Republic.</p>

<p>Was direct action ever more than hot air? To answer such a
question we must evaluate the motives of the speakers and its effect
on the listeners. The ultra-left is concerned only with the first,
and the reformist only with the second.</p>

<p>The creation of local Councils of Action provided great
opportunities for revolutionaries. The Communist Party, though very
new (the first issue of its paper only appeared on 5 August)
intervened in many areas and established its credentials. It did so
<em>without being inside the Labour Party</em> and all the while
arguing for workers to resist &#8216;attempts by trade union and Labour
leaders to frustrate the wishes of the rank and file ... at the
critical moment&#8217;. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a></p>

<p>No less than 350 local Councils of Action were set up by September
1920 and some went far beyond what the official leaders intended.
Merthyr Tydfil&#8217;s Central Council of local labour representatives
was subject to instant recall and believed itself &#8216;destined to be
an important instrument for the emancipation of the workers&#8217;. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a>
Birmingham wanted a Congress of local councils to force the national
body to honour its general strike commitment and so on. Lenin was
misinformed when he took the Councils of Action to be &#8216;the same
kind of dual power as we had under Kerensky,&#8217; <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a>
but they nevertheless had a long-term impact. In 1926 these councils
were revived as the organisational backbone of the General Strike.</p>

<p>The motives of the labour bureaucracy presented a very different
picture from those of the rank and file. Underlying superficial
differences between right and left officials there was a convergence
of ideas. Direct action was to <em>assist</em> parliamentary action.
Reviewing the motive for the Council of Action MacDonald wrote:
&#8216;There was as much communism about the Council of Action and the
policy that created it, as in taking a breakfast. <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a>
Direct action showed <em>the ability of reformists to move radically
to the left and manipulate extra-parliamentary activity when the need
arose.</em> The difference between left and right was never more than
whether to offer the carrot or the stick and the years showed that
both sides were adept in the use of either.</p>

<p>MacDonald and others claimed they were only defending the
constitution, but no bourgeois constitution has ever conceded the
right of the population to determine war and peace. The willingness
of both right and left Labour and trade union leaders to use extra-
parliamentary means proves that the point of reference for reformists
is not this or that institution but the function of mediation between
classes. <a href="#ne" name="fe">[5*]</a></p>

<p>McGurk&#8217;s comment, &#8216;We are either constitutionalists, or we are
not&#8217;, had highlighted an important question for socialists. For
anyone who takes the emancipation of the working class seriously a
choice of priorities must be made. On the one hand we have the
classic reformist position as stated by Glasier: &#8216;A thousand votes
definitely given for Socialism assesses more promise and potentiality
for working class emancipation than 10 million workmen out on
strike.&#8217; <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a> On the other there is
Lenin&#8217;s statement that parliamentary action is &#8216;the lowest form
of the movement&#8217;. <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a></p>

<p>In the drama of the post-war period only the first of these
propositions was tested. Despite all the fire and brimstone the
movement for mass struggle had been skilfully defused. In return the
British working class has been rewarded by seven Labour governments.
Who was right &#8211; Lenin or Glasier?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Black Friday &#8211; the transition to a governing party</h4>

<p class="fst">There is a bitter irony in the history of the British labour
movement. The labour bureaucracy has committed gross acts of
betrayal, but the weakness of the revolutionary left has meant that
far from being punished or overthrown they are frequently
strengthened. <em>Sell-outs can expose reformism</em>. Alas, under
certain conditions <em>they can have the opposite result</em>,
weakening the rank and file and so raising the status and influence
of the bureaucracy.</p>

<p>This happened in 1921 when the colliery owners demanded a wage cut
of up to 50 per cent in some areas. On Black Friday, 15 April, the
Triple Alliance leaders representing the railwaymen, transport
workers and miners ran away from their promise to stand together and
fight as one. They left one million miners to be smashed in a
gruelling three month fight. Far from damaging the labour
bureaucracy. Black Friday freed it from the spectre of revolution.</p>

<p>In 1919 and 1920 class confidence at the point of production had
given trade union matters great weight on the scales of reformism.
The capitalist ideology of the &#8216;nation&#8217; was relatively light.
Black Friday reversed this. The centre of reformism shifted from
union officials towards the Labour Party.</p>

<p>The background to this development was the abrupt end of the
post-war boom in early 1921. Compared with 1920 exports were down by
48 per cent, imports by 44 per cent. Between December 1920 and March
1921 unemployment <em>tripled</em> (from 5.8 to 17.8 per cent of
insured workers). Labour had helped prevent major advance when
conditions were favourable. Now that the workers were on the
defensive, how good was it as a protective shield?</p>

<p>Alas it contributed nothing to the resistance of either the
unemployed or the strongly organised workers. MacDonald, for example,
denounced the workless for exacting the dole (the system did not
exist then): &#8216;It matters not [to them] if the dole is ruinous and
soon becomes intolerable ... and handicaps a true Socialist policy.&#8217;
Unemployed agitation would embarrass local Labour authorities or
worse, compel them to grant the demands: &#8216;The next thing that
happens is that they alienate support, their Labour and Socialist
majorities disappear, and the old interests come into possession.&#8217;
And why should Labour be concerned with these folk anyway: &#8216;how
many of the present unemployed supported [us] at the last election?&#8217; <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a></p>

<p>Black Friday destroyed the resistance of the organised employed
and Labour, though playing second fiddle to the union bureaucrats,
contributed its bit to the <em>debâcle</em>. Lloyd George, the Prime
Minister, was confident that &#8216;J.H. Thomas wants no revolution. He
wants to be Prime Minister ... I have complete confidence in Thomas&#8217;s
selfishness [and] the Labour Party will be for moderation. They have
nothing to gain politically.&#8217; <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>
<p>The consequences of Black Friday became plain as one disaster
followed another. Trade union membership suddenly went into reverse,
failing from its 1920 peak of eight million to just five million
three years later. The Labour leaders fastened like vultures on the
weakened body of the movement. It was with ill-concealed pleasure
that MacDonald declared: &#8216;We may yet look back upon these dark days
with gratitude.&#8217; <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a> He had good
reason: &#8216;The events of this strike ought to settle for a long time
the influence of those who preached the doctrine that Labour can
emancipate itself by industrial means alone.&#8217; <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a></p>

<p>Stripped of rhetoric the Labour left&#8217;s solution was little
different from MacDonald&#8217;s. <strong>Labour Leader</strong> declared the
lesson of Black Friday was the need to attack capitalism in its
&#8216;legislative citadel&#8217;.</p>

<p class="quoteb">That citadel can be assaulted and won without a single
child losing a meal ... without disorder and without fear of
starvation ... For every insult, for every injury, for every broken
promise and shattered illusion, the people can take revenge at the
ballot box. <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The swing of the pendulum</h4>

<p class="fst">The sudden decline of industrial militancy had a dramatic effect
on Labour&#8217;s internal life and underlined its parasitic nature. When
the body of the labour movement was healthy, Labour&#8217;s local
organisation, as represented by the ILP, was weak. The first great
rise in class struggle, 1910&#8211;14, cost the ILP a quarter of its
membership. <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a> The post-war
revolutionary ferment left the party &#8216;in a state of confusion and
crisis&#8217;. In contrast, the period of deep downturn, 1922&#8211;5, saw
the ILP reaching &#8216;the pinnacle of its success&#8217;. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a> <a href="#nf" name="ff">[6*]</a></p>

<p>By October 1922 <strong>Labour Leader</strong> was talking of &#8216;something
remarkable in the atmosphere; a sense of relief, of hope, of new
impulse to work [because the party is] no longer with one hand tied
behind its back, in the conflict with Communism.&#8217; <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a>
That same month John Paton, on the far left of the ILP, explained how
militants defeated in class struggle could transfer their hopes to
Labour as a <em>substitute</em>. He traced the rise and fall of
workers&#8217; struggle which led to its transformation into &#8216;political&#8217;
(by which he meant parliamentary) thinking. During the war workers had:</p>

<p class="quoteb">tasted for the first time a real sense of power. In
engineering on the Clyde the shop stewards movement acquired a
remarkable power and influence, while in mining areas the men openly
boasted that THEY were running the pits ... The dazzling prospect of
industrial freedom has gone like a dream ... sunk in despair, in
utter disillusion.</p>

<p class="quote">Now ... men&#8217;s minds are returning in the direction of
building surely and solidly on the will of a politically educated
people. <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The general election of 1922 confirmed what Paton had sensed.
Compared with 1918 Labour&#8217;s vote doubled to 4.2 million <em>at the
very moment that trade union membership was plummeting</em>. The
quality of the Labour vote changed too. No longer was it an
incidental spin-off of mass struggle. It represented an alternative
to struggle for an embittered working class.</p>

<p>The transformation also showed itself in a strict separation
between the industrial and political wings. The NUR split its chief
posts &#8211; with Thomas as &#8216;political secretary&#8217;, and Cramp as
&#8216;industrial secretary&#8217;. The Miners&#8217; Federation decided their
president and secretary could not sit in parliament. <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a>
The TUC replaced its &#8216;Parliamentary Committee&#8217; with a General
Council because it felt &#8216;that Congress should develop the
industrial side of the Movement as against the &#8220;deputizing&#8221; or
&#8220;political&#8221; conception.&#8217; <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a>
From the other side the first Labour government insisted that trade
unionists who became ministers must give up their union positions. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a></p>

<p>These adjustments altered the balance of power between the hostile
brothers &#8211; trade union officialdom and the professional
politicians. As in the period of Taff Vale, it was the industrial
retreat following Black Friday which allowed professional politicians
such as MacDonald and Snowden to regain their influence. The
unresolvable contradiction in the 1918 Constitution &#8211; a &#8216;classless&#8217;
party dominated by union officials &#8211; seemed to be working itself
out in favour of the former.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#fa" name="na">1*.</a> Labour politicians were not alone
in thinking that in a post-war conditions reformism was the best
defence of the existing system. C.P. Scott, a former Liberal MP,
editor of the <strong>Manchester Guardian</strong> and a sharp political
commentator had this to say: &#8216;the crude extravagance and injustice
of the Bolshevik economic doctrine ... seems to be penetrating to
some extent our own Labour extremists ... It couldn&#8217;t happen if we
have a genuinely progressive Government whom the workers could trust.
Possibly we might get that after a General Election when the Labour
Party comes back with a force sufficient to determine policy. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fb" name="nb">2*.</a> <strong>Forward</strong>
printed an account of Shinwell&#8217;s trial which stated that Shinwell
addressed a meeting of his own seamen&#8217;s union to discuss:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the employment of yellow labour ... . Somebody in the
audience shouted out &#8211; &#8216;What about the Strike&#8217;  &#8211; and
Shinwell replied that ... the strike did not concern them.</p>

<p class="quote">Lord Scott Dickson &#8211; &#8216;There was no 40 hours&#8217;
movement among the seamen?&#8217;</p>

<p class="quote">Answer: &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fc" name="nc">3*.</a> This half arose because he was a
prospective candidate for South Ayrshire but never went to the poll.
Clegg writes: &#8216;Smillie&#8217;s undeserved reputation as a militant was
due to his habit of making up his own mind and, once he had done so,
paying little attention to what others had to say.&#8217; <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fd" name="nd">4*.</a> Robert Williams, leader of the
Transport Workers and the most verbally extreme union leader (who
went to the extent of joining the Communist Party) echoed these
sentiments in his appeal for a national conference of workers&#8217;
representatives: &#8216;There can be no doubt that until the lead comes
from some more or less responsible quarter, matters will reach such a
state that open insurrection or revolutionary action may speedily
ensue. We most hold the official convention to prevent unofficial
strikes, to avoid the growth of anti-officialism among the best of
our men and women ...&#8217;  <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fe" name="ne">5*.</a> A failure to understand this point
is the chief failing of Ralph Miliband&#8217;s otherwise valuable book
<strong>Parliamentary Socialism</strong>. Its analysis, outlined in its first
paragraph, is that the chief characteristic of Labour is its
parliamentarism. The same weakness afflicts Geoffrey Foote&#8217;s useful
book on The <strong>Labour Party&#8217;s Political Thought</strong>. Both authors
understand the Labour Party&#8217;s limitations but fail to penetrate
beneath the institutional surface, to the class relations beneath.
The party is not an independent body but one half of a reformist
labour bureaucracy, the other half being the union officials. If
either feel that parliamentarism is actually an obstacle to the
process of Mediation it may be put aside. This happened in 1914 and
1920. In the first case the bureaucracy was willing to see a
political trace and the virtual extinction of parliament and the PLP
in order to gain access to important positions. In both Miliband and
Foote the actual class straggle plays little role in their analysis.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#ff" name="nf">6*.</a> In the early 1920s local Labour
Parties were still in the process of formation and so the ILP
continued to reflect what internal organisation there was. Writing of
pre-war Britain, Williams wrote that &#8216;Over most of the country
indeed <em>the ILP was the Labour Party</em>.&#8217; <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a>
This was still true in 1918 when the ILP had 672 branches to Labour&#8217;s
158. The main growth of local Labour Parties seems to have taken
place around 1924. <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a></p>
