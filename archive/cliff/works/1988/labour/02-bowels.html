<h1>2. &#8216;Out of the Bowels of the TUC&#8217;</h1>

<br/>
<h4>A Background of Defeat and Passivity</h4>

<p class="fst">BY THE LATE 1890s, the &#8216;socialist boom&#8217; fuelled by new
unionism was tailing off. The ILP dropped from 11,000 subscription
paying members in 1895 to 5,000 in 1901 <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>
and was bankrupt, its National Administrative Committee having to
curtail meetings to a quarterly basis.</p>

<p>In the 1895 general election 28 ILP candidates stood, but all
lost, including Hardie, until then the party&#8217;s only MP. Together
they received 25,000 votes, not a discreditable total if the aim was
to rally the advanced section of the class. But for a party which
muted its principles to gain seats in parliament the result was
disastrous.</p>

<p>[This fact did not escape the ILP&#8217;s rivals on right and left.
Jenkins, Lib-Lab president of the 1895 Trades Union Congress, crowed
about the election result: &#8216;Was it possible to conceive a greater
exhibition of impotence or a smaller justification for the pretension
to speak and act in the name of universal labour.&#8217; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>
The SDF was pleased too. Being open about its socialism and committed
to a definite theory (although posed in sterile sectarian fashion) it
survived the difficult years better than its rival. In 1898, the SDF
could claimed that in five years it had doubled its number of
branches to reach 137, two thirds of the ILP&#8217;s total. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p>So at a time when the Labour Party was in the making, even watered
down socialism was narrowly based. The ILP&#8217;s check on the electoral
front was matched by the rout of its new unionist supporters at the
TUC. After 1889 the new unions fought regular battles with the old.
At first the laurels went the way of the left. In 1890 a motion for
the legal eight-hour day, which had been defeated by 88 votes to 63
at the previous year&#8217;s TUC, passed by 193 to 155. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a>
[The 1893 TUC voted &#8216;for Socialism&#8217;: &#8216;the principle of
collective ownership and control of all the means of production and
distribution.&#8217; <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> The 1894 Congress
added land and mines nationalisation.]</p>

<p>But the retreat of the mass movement allowed a counter-attack. The
presidential address at the 1895 TUC denounced the ILP as: &#8216;an
anti-Labour, anti-trade-unionist movement ... The Congress had been
in danger of being exploited by men who were really outside the
labour movement ...&#8217; <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p>This old unionist offensive took the form of a rule change. Until
then each delegate had a single vote, and political representatives
as well as Trades Councils could attend. Now <em>the card vote system
was introduced</em> and all delegates not directly from unions
expelled. Instantly control moved to the giant right-wing unions of
coal and cotton. The small unions under ILP influence were powerless
to prevent this or keep the proponents of a Labour Party at Congress.
It is ironic that the same card vote system should turn up later as
the chief weapon in controlling Labour Party conferences.</p>

<p>In 1895 all hope of a Labour Party seemed lost. Yet five years
later the TUC set one up. What had produced the dramatic turn around?
The answer was a ruling-class attack which, in sharp contrast to
1889&#8217;s mass activity, left the rank and file as passive by-standers
to the doings of the bureaucracy. <em>The ILP had been born of an
advanced left wing movement. The Labour Party was born of
bureaucratic manoeuvres at the TUC, of a step backward in the class struggle.</em></p>

<p>Employers broke unions one by one, starting with 70,000 Scottish
miners who were battered into submission in 1894. For most workers
such defeats do not encourage the revolutionary idea that class
action can succeed where sectional action fails. More common is the
reformist conclusion which Hardie (a former miners&#8217; union official
himself) was quick to draw &#8211; that electoral politics are the
answer:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Scotch coal strike, which to all appearances has
ended in the utter rout of the men, has nevertheless been a great
victory. For whom? ... For the Labour movement ... The result of the
bitter experiences of the last 18 weeks has been the decision of many
miners to abandon [conventional] party politics, and to throw in
their lot with the ILP. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Next year saw the defeat of the Boot and Shoe Operatives. Again
Hardie chimed in with these comforting words: &#8216;The men have been
defeated. That is the long and the short of it ... However the lesson
of the dispute will not be lost, and the municipal election the other
day in Leicester shows that the men have learnt their lesson well.&#8217;
<a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> The railwaymen proposed Labour
representation to the TUC after their &#8216;All Grades Movement&#8217; was
broken. Next it was the turn of the proudest of the old unions, the
Amalgamated Society of Engineers, to be locked out.</p>

<p>Within six months the employers had reasserted the right to be
&#8216;masters in their own shops.&#8217; <strong>Labour Leader</strong>&#8217;s comment?
&#8216;Failure. And yet in the end it may turn out that the lesson was
worth the cost ... it would be more in accordance with the
traditional principles of English politics and common sense <em>if the
battle was transferred from the poverty stricken homes of the workers
to the floor of the House of Commons</em>.&#8217; <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p>Emboldened by successes, employers used the courts ever more
frequently. This culminated in the Taff Vale decision, which not only
outlawed picketing but compiled unions to refund to their employers
every penny lost during a strike. These defeats shook the trade union
bureaucracy profoundly. In 1902 one leader declared that: &#8216;Menaced
on every hand in workshop, court of law, and press. Trade Unionism
has no refuge except the ballot box and Labour Representation.&#8217;
<a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>However the scale of the employers&#8217; offensive must be kept in
perspective. In 1898, following the engineers&#8217; defeat, the TUC
president had warned that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">For the first time in the history of our movement we had
to face a mammoth combination of military-led capital, whose object,
as openly stated by its leader, was to cripple, if not crush the
forces of trade unionism ... <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">That phrase &#8216;cripple, if not crush&#8217; was all-important. The
fights at the end of the century had been bitter, but their effect
was <em>to demoralise, to weaken workers&#8217; confidence in their own
industrial strength,</em> not to sting them into activity on their own
account. Within the Unions themselves, <em>the influence of the
bureaucracy <strong>vis &#224; vis</strong> the rank and file was
immeasurably strengthened.</em> Their numbers were growing rapidly in
spite of the attacks. In 1850 there had been no full-time officials;
but in 1892 there were 600. Yet that year alone the number of
engineering officials increased fourfold, while the Carpenters&#8217;
officials grew tenfold. By 1920 there were between three and four
thousand full-time officials. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>One result of the employers&#8217; counter-attack was the partial
incorporation of the bureaucracy into working closely with employers
through conciliation schemes. The most important was the Brooklands
Agreement covering textiles. Such arrangements reduced the number of
strikes significantly until a rank and file revolt overturned them
after 1910.</p>

<p>Another effect was to jolt the bureaucracy into realising they
could neither protect the membership nor defend the union coffers
(which were perhaps closer to their hearts). Against their will they
were forced to turn from purely economic action towards politics. But
they did so in their own interests. The TUC, which in 1895 had
totally rejected the idea of a Labour Party, now welcomed it. [The
ILP&#8217;s attitude to building a Labour Party also changed during the
1890s. Trades unions and trades councils had been invited to the 1893
Bradford Conference of the ILP, and, with two votes against, the
conference had opted for a federal structure into which such groups
could be absorbed. As Cо1е put it: The ILP at Bradford was still
dreaming of becoming the Labour Party. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a>
After the ILP&#8217;s rebuttal at the 1895 TUC, Hardie suggested &#8216;that
the ILP may open the door for these excluded bodies and such others
as cared to join, and so bring about a Socialist Trades Union
Congress&#8217;. He ventured to predict that such a congress may, before
the end of the century, become a focus for working class opinion of
all shades.&#8217; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p>In the conditions of the late 1890s this idea was a non-barter. An
alliance now had to be on the trade unions terms and anything which
stood in the way had to be avoided. In 1899 a ballot forced upon the
ILP&#8217;s National Administrative Council Showed 2,397 votes in favour
of federation with the SDF and 1,695 for direct fusion. So strong was
the feeling in favour of &#8216;socialist unity&#8217; that no vote against
was taken. Nevertheless the council managed to avoid acting upon the
ballot result as it &#8216;would speedily make shipwreck of the ILP&#8217; in
its delicate negotiations with the union bureaucracy.&#8217; <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Foundation Conference creates a &#8216;Labour Alliance&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">The resolution that led to the Labour Representation Committee
(LRC) was moved by rail union delegates at the 1899 TUC and passed by
546,000 to 434,000. It called for &#8216;a special congress of
representatives ... to devise ways and means for securing the return
of an increased number of labour members to the next parliament.&#8217;
<a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a> The Labour Representation
Committee was duly founded on 27 February 1900 in London. There were
129 delegates; sixty-five represented 568,000 trade unionists, while
the socialist society delegates spoke for 13,000 members of the ILP,
9,000 from the SDF and 861 Fabians. A Labour Representation Committee
was elected with seven trade unionists and five socialist society
members (two from the ILP, two from the SDF and one Fabian).</p>

<p>Three alternatives were presented to the delegates. The SDF
suggested: &#8216;a party organisation separate from the capitalist
parties based upon a recognition of the class war ... having for its
ultimate object the socialisation of the means of production,
distribution and exchange.&#8217; <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a> The
right wanted LRC members of parliament to adopt a policy consisting
of just &#8216;four or five planks ... the said representatives to be
left entirely free on all purely political questions.&#8217; <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a>
This meant a continuation of Lib-Labism. Immediate problems such as
Taff Vale would have been taken up, but once resolved, the LRC MPs
would have sunk back into the Liberal fold.</p>

<p>Keir Hardie defeated both positions. He steered a precise middle
course proposing no more and no less than: &#8216;a distinct Labour Group
in Parliament, who shall have their own Whips.&#8217; So there was to be
an organisational break with the old parties, but there was to be no
marked political differentiation. The only policy suggested was &#8216;a
readiness to co-operate with any party which for the time being may
be engaged in promoting legislation in the direct interest of
labour.&#8217; <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> Though called the LRC
until 1906, the Labour Party was launched.</p>

<p>It was built <em>from the top downwards.</em> Class struggle played
no role at all:</p>

<p class="quoteb">From 1899 to 1907 was a period of industrial peace
unparalleled between 1891 when statistics started, and 1933, when a
comparable period began ... The annual average of working days lost
through disputes was less than 3 million and in no years was the
total as large as 5 million. By contrast ... from 1908 to 1932 ...
the annual average (excluding 1926) was 14 million. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The 1899 TUC which made the fateful decision did not even stir the
ILP. <strong>Labour Leader</strong>&#8217;s article on the Congress was entitled
<em>Not worth the Candle</em>: &#8216;It was generally admitted that the
congress this year has been exceptionally dull.&#8217; <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a>
The formation of the LRC itself only merited one quarter of a column
in <strong>The Times</strong>. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p>Ordinary workers greeted the LRC with apathy. The engineers and
boot and shoe operatives had suffered serious blows and their
officials therefore looked eagerly to parliament. But ballots on
affiliation produced the following results: out of the 32,000 boot
and shoe operatives only 6 ½ per cent bothered to vote, 1,500 for
affiliation and 675 against. The ASE result was worse. Out of 85,000,
only 4 per cent voted, 2897 for and 702 against. Participation was so
appalling that even though the engineers vote was positive, the union
leadership felt unable to affiliate. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p>The 1900 general election tells the same tale. The LRC had not yet
proved itself to union officials and with just &#163;33 to spend on the
entire campaign it was only able to promote three candidates of its
own, of whom Keir Hardie and Richard Bell of the rail union were
successful. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a> The ILP ran ten
candidates without victory. The joint total of some 66,000 votes
proved the majority of workers had still to be won to a reformist
position. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p>The establishment of the LRC was bureaucratic in another sense. It
involved merely a change of label, but <em>no</em> change of politics.
For example Clarke&#8217;s study of Lancashire tells how &#8216;the Ince
Liberal Registration Society (Registration Agent, Wm Shaw) ceased to
exist and there subsequently appeared the Ince Division Labour
Registration Association (Registration Agent Wm Shaw).&#8217; <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a>
As late as May 1914 the Labour candidate for North East Derbyshire
told voters that &#8216;there is no more ardent Liberal in the country
than I have been, and there is no more ardent Liberal now.&#8217; <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p>Such situations could lead to embarrassment. Until he became LRC
MP for Barnard Castle in 1903, Arthur Henderson had for seven years
been a Liberal election agent. During his campaign his opponents had
the discourtesy to publish his earlier denunciations of the ILP&#8217;s
socialism. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a> Richard Bell had so
little adapted his position that he campaigned publicly for the
election of a Liberal in Norwich against the LRC candidate, and had
to be disciplined! <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The political expression of the trade union bureaucracy</h4>

<p class="fst">The major gain made by the formation of the LRC was
organisationally to detach the trade unions leaders from the Liberal
Party. They now owed political allegiance to their own creation.</p>

<p>Most union officials who affiliated their organisations did so
because they wanted to get to parliament. The first affiliations
included just three unions which could be said to be socialist
through their new unionist background &#8211; two dockers&#8217;
organisations and the Gas Workers. These amounted to only one fifth
of the total. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p>Opposition to the LRC came from coal and cotton, which mustered
351,140 of the 434,000 votes cast against the resolution. Miners&#8217;
officials, in particular, could expect to become Lib-Lab MPs without
outside help because of the membership&#8217;s geographical
concentration. This was therefore the last major union to see the
utility of the Labour Party, only affiliating in 1909.</p>

<p>The second wave of affiliation was induced by Taff Vale. <strong>Labour
Leader</strong> claimed that from the point of view of the nascent Labour
Party &#8216;nothing could have been more fortunate for Trade Unionism
than the Taff Vale decision. It has awakened men to a sense of
danger.&#8217; <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a></p>

<p>From the very outset the trade unions had the preponderant weight
in their &#8216;Labour Alliance&#8217; with the Socialist societies (ILP and
Fabians). The interlocking of union officials and the Labour Party
showed itself in a number of ways. Before the First World War union
sponsored MPs formed 95 per cent of the Parliamentary Labour Party,
and of the thirteen members of the TUC&#8217;s leading committee, nine
were Labour MPs. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p>In one sense this was the <em>direct entry of trade unions into
political affairs.</em> However it also represented <em>a retreat from
trade unionism &#8211; from the belief that collective organisation could
defend itself.</em> Seen from this angle the LRC was precisely that
<em>substitute for trade unionism</em> that Mann had found so absurd.
O&#8217;Grady told the 1898 TUC that: &#8216;their efforts, in his opinion,
should be directed towards removing the fight from the industrial to
the political field.&#8217; <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a> There were
good reasons for this attitude. Faced with the threat arising from
the Taff Vale decision, the union officials had a frightening
prospect looming up before them. They might have to fight. Clynes, a
prominent union leader, recalled:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I believe that had there not been a Labour Party in 1901,
to which angry workmen could flock, the Taff Vale blow at the justice
they claimed might have caused them to strike a counter-blow by
proclaiming a state of open revolution throughout the big industrial
centres of England. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The creation of the LRC provided a bureaucratic political
alternative to industrial activity, a means of separating politics
and economics. However, as with all else to do with Labour, there was
a contradiction. It was the link which exists in the real world
between economics and politics, between the state and the bosses,
that brought the LRC into existence. Furthermore the party transposed
much of the outlook of the trade union bureaucracy. Thus the LRC&#8217;s
first address to the affiliated members described it as &#8216;Trade
Unionism and the Principles of Trade Unionism, applied to national
affairs.&#8217; <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a></p>

<p>Applying this dictum produced curious results. Just as trade
unions recruit people regardless of their politics on the basis of
their position in industry, so the Labour Party sought to gather
workers&#8217; votes regardless of their politics. According to Keir
Hardie, Labour must be &#8216;Conservative enough to preserve everything
that is good. Liberal enough to reform what is capable of being
reformed; and Radical enough to uproot and destroy whatever is
altogether wrong.&#8217; <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a> Elsewhere,
Snowden portrayed Labour as &#8216;a neutral meeting ground where Liberal
and Tory might meet together.&#8217; <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The problem of false consciousness</h4>
<p>There is no such thing as neutral ground in class society. Take
the decision not to include class war in the party programme. This
implied a definite political attitude, as one supporter realised in 1921:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Once you admit &#8216;the class war&#8217; you are at once more
or less committed to political and industrial tactics of &#8216;war to
the knife&#8217;. So long as the working class is regarded as an
oppressed class yearning for freedom, standing together homogeneously
face to face with its oppressors ... so long are you committed to a
policy of revolution rather than evolution ... Deny &#8216;the class
war&#8217;, and [there] will logically follow politics of &#8216;arrangements&#8217;
of &#8216;reform&#8217; of &#8216;understandings&#8217; and &#8216;alliances&#8217;. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This is correct, but the fact remained that those who supported
the Labour Party believed it <em>could</em> be politically neutral. We
are confronted here with a recurring problem &#8211; the difference
between Labour&#8217;s understanding of itself and its actual position,
between myth and reality. To comprehend this we must briefly discuss
the concept &#8216;false consciousness&#8217;.</p>

<p>Marx stated the dichotomy between human understanding of the world
and social reality in his <em>Preface</em> to <strong>A Contribution to the
Critique of Political Economy</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">a distinction should always be made between the material
transformation of the material conditions of prediction ... and the
legal, political, religious, aesthetic or philosophical &#8211; in short
ideological &#8211; forms in which men become conscious of [social]
conflict and fight it out.</p>

<p class="fst">We can see how this works in the context of Labour. Supporters
accepted that Labour rejected class war and believed they could take
a neutral, common-sense attitude to politics. They were convinced of
the separateness of politics and economics, the existence of a
community interest shared by all classes, and the impartiality of the
state and the law. But while reformist ideas are sincerely held they
are wrong. Historical experience has shown that politics and
economics <em>are</em> intimately connected, that the state is a weapon
of class rule and so on.</p>

<p>Although there is a gap between reality and reformist ideology,
the two are connected dialectically. If class struggle had led
<em>automatically</em> to direct political conclusions we would have
seen the irresistible rise of a mass revolutionary, organisation in
Britain. This has patently not been the case. If on the other hand
there had been no link between the outside world and reformist
consciousness then the Labour Party would not have come into existence.</p>

<p>So the reformist view of the world is <em>false consciousness,</em>
but it has an indirect yet genuine link with the outside world, is
influenced by the outside world and in turn influences it.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A technical division of labour</h4>

<p class="fst">The union bureaucrat is at one remove from the class struggle,
stepping between workers and employers when they conflict with each
other to negotiate settlements. <em>The Labour Party is twice removed.</em>
From birth it claimed to embody the &#8216;principle of <em>trade unionism</em>
applied to <em>national affairs</em>&#8217;, but the two were qualitatively
different. <em>The trade union bureaucracy is weak on political ideas</em>
since its main job is to mediate on wages and conditions. Further,
the bureaucracy is divided on sectional grounds &#8211; between different
industries, crafts and so on, and is subject to collective pressure
from the rank and file in workplaces.</p>

<p>However <em>parliamentary work requires a different bureaucracy.</em>
They must seek support from workers not as a collective group but as
atomised citizens in the polling booths. They must be professional
politicians with the appropriate skills and broad electoral
attraction. The MPs and full-time Labour intellectuals do this job.
[The division of labour between union officials and reformist
politicians was becoming visible within the ILP even before the
formation of the labour Party. In 1898 Tom Mann, dissatisfied with
the predominantly political preoccupations of the ILP, resigned. That
same year Pete Сurrаn, an organiser of the gas workers, was also
forced to choose between his political and Industrial roles, quitting
the ILP council. As Pelling tells &#8216;The old direct link with New
Unionism was severed: the party was now being run, under Hardie&#8217;s
direction, by a new type of Council member &#8211; the full-time
journalist politician, such as Ramsay McDonald, Snowden or Glasier,
who had no trade-union ties and was free to devote all or most of his
time if necessary to the activities of the party.&#8217; <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a>]</p>

<p>It was only as <em>a party standing above trade unionism</em> that
Labour could successfully appeal to an electorate, the majority of
whom were not unionised. This was brought home by the notable failure
of many trade union candidates to attract the votes even of their own
members. The connection between union support and voting in elections
is an interesting one, but notoriously difficult to track down, since
the bourgeois democratic system deliberately obliterates the idea of
class, reducing everyone to the meaningless level of citizen. Only
the miners with their large numbers and geographical concentration
can be identified with any certainty in the returns. But even here,
in the traditionally compact and unionised communities the link
between union membership and voting behaviour was weak. As the
historian of mining politics records:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Generally speaking, if a Liberal candidate was also in
the field it was rare for the Labour man, even if he himself was a
miner or miners&#8217; official, to poll as much as half of the mining
vote in the constituency. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus in 1910 Herbert Smith, president of the Yorkshire Miners&#8217;
Association, attracted just 2,000 votes in a constituency that
included 5,000 miners. He actually came bottom, the Liberal receiving
8,000 votes and the Tory 3,400! <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a>
Because the link between official union recommendations and the vote
is so tenuous Labour could claim that as an electoral party it must
make a much wider appeal to succeed.</p>

<p>However, trade union officials could retort with equal justice
<em>that without the trade unions, the Labour Party would not exist.</em>
It was in this sense that Bevin said that the Labour Party was &#8216;born
out of the bowels of the TUC.&#8217;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Denying class in a class society</h4>

<p class="fst">In structure as well as politics the party therefore consists of
the uneasy combination of direct class organisation through the
unions and nationally orientated politics. It voices working class
aspirations but only to the extent that they can be fitted into the
workings of the national state. Snowden put it like this:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Labour Party is not seeking any class triumph. Its
object is not to make the manual labour class dominant ... It is
quite true that the Labour and Socialist Party makes its appeal to
the wage-earning classes. It does that because there are the people
who need to be aroused to a fuller sense of civic duty ... as they
are the vast majority of the electorate they must exercise the
political influence. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The balance between the two factors is expressed in the split
between Labour&#8217;s left and right &#8211; each side articulating one
aspect of a common reformist whole. Thus Will Thorne&#8217;s 1906
election manifesto said a vote for him meant &#8216;encouragement to all
who suffer under the heel of Capitalism; a blow struck for the
workers in that war between Capitalism and Labour which must be waged
relentlessly until the emancipation of the workers is achieved by the
abolition of the Capitalist system.&#8217; <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a>
At the other end of the spectrum was the Belfast candidate, William
Walker whose manifesto displayed prominently the following words: I
am, as I have always been, a supporter of the Legislative Union of
Great Britain and Ireland, and will do all in my power to maintain
unimpaired the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament.&#8217; <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p>The LRC, it appeared, had no separate political programme. But
this was an illusion. It was all very well to create an independent
organisational platform; what speeches were to be made from it? Nine
times out of ten the early Labour Party plumped for the Liberal
policy. It showed few signs of political self-reliance. In May 1900
an LRC sub-committee suggested:</p>

<p class="quoteb">that organisations affiliated to us should run their
candidates to begin with in such a way as to make it possible for
either the local Liberal or Conservative Association to leave an open
field for Labour candidates.</p>

<p class="quote">We think it would be advisable to write to the Liberal
and Conservative Whips stating that ... we have no hostility to other
politics parties, and that ... we shall be glad of their cooperation
in getting these candidates through. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This proposal jeopardised even the minimal independence enshrined
in the decision to create a &#8216;distinct Labour group&#8217;. In the event
the LRC was evenly split on this motion, but the chairman&#8217;s casting
vote led to its defeat.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s organisation was strengthened in 1903 when unions
decided to levy their members at a rate of one penny per person, and
a &#8216;Party Pledge&#8217; was passed to bind MPs to majority decisions of
the parliamentary group. But organisational advance was continually
undermined by political dependence on the Liberals.</p>

<p>Without a mass reformism outside to buoy it up, the
bureaucratically formed Labour Party led a precarious existence. Its
efforts to progress hung between fighting the Liberals to win their
voters and fawning upon them for fear of losing &#8216;moderate&#8217; support.</p>

<p>Hardie wrote begging letters to Liberal dignitaries, pleading with
them to lead Labour (and lend it their electoral influence!) To John
Morley whom he had so recently denounced in the strongest terms, he
wrote: &#8216;What is wanted ... is a man with the brain to dare, the
hand to do, and the heart to inspire. Will you be that man?&#8217; <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a>
His 1903 missive to Lloyd George was still more pathetic: &#8216;Here is
a leadership sufficient to gratify the loftiest aspirations and it is
within your reach; it is yours for the taking.&#8217; <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>

<p>[Labour&#8217;s craven attitude towards Lloyd George as a possible
leader had a remarkable sequel. In 1916 Lloyd George &#8216;jocularly
remarked&#8217; to Ramsay MacDonald, &#8216;that he might have to put him in
prison [for his pacifist views] ... Discussing Mr Lloyd George&#8217;s
future, Mr MacDonald said that he quite realised the possibility of
his coming the leader of the Labour Party&#8217;. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a>
In the <strong>Political Diaries of C.P. Scott</strong>, it is recorded that in
December 1917 Sidney Webb agreed with MacDonald that Lloyd George
might one day be a suitable leader for the Labour Party. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a>
And as late as June 1926 the idea of Lloyd George&#8217;s joining the
Labour Party was canvassed. This time, however, it was MacDonald who
put a stop to the idea, declaring that &#8216;the Labour Party was much
too sedate and practical&#8217; for Lloyd George. He advised him to join
the Communists instead. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a>]</p>

<p>Keir Hardie&#8217;s appeals fell on stony ground. However he and
MacDonald solved Labour&#8217;s electoral problem in a brilliantly
dishonest way. All the while proclaiming the LRC&#8217;s independence,
MacDonald secretly arranged with Herbert Gladstone, the national
Liberal election agent, that LRC candidates would have a free run in
certain constituencies if they left the Liberals an open field
elsewhere. The pact remained concealed for fifty years. Had it been
known, Labour&#8217;s only claim to distinction would have been blown sky
high. Its value was demonstrated in the 1906 general election when 19
out of the 27 successful Labour candidates were returned for seats
ceded under the arrangement. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a> But
secret as it was, <em>the pact left a dangerous legacy of dependence
on the Liberal Party for electoral gains.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Significance</h4>

<p class="fst">Keir Hardie claimed the formation of the LRC was a major
breakthrough when he addressed the 1903 Labour Conference, but his
words raised an important doubt: &#8216;They all, Liberal, Tory and
Socialist alike rejoiced at the magnificent conference got together
in that hall. What was the principle which enabled them all to come
together &#8211; Independence.&#8217; <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a> But
if Liberals, Tories and Socialists all agreed, what exactly were they
independent of?</p>

<p>Historians sympathetic to the Labour Party give more sober
assessments but still assert that the Labour Alliance &#8216;made
possible a political, social and economic achievement far beyond ...
hopes or expectations&#8217;, or that it was &#8216;the best tool possible
under the circumstances.&#8217; <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a> There
are grains of truth in these arguments. The LRC and later the Labour
Party were an advance on Lib-Labism.</p>

<p>To rally workers to vote against the established and openly
capitalist parties, in favour of one claiming to represent working
class interests, <em>was a forward move in the conditions of 1900,</em>
because it advanced the creation of a mass reformist party if only in
an organisational sense. Furthermore, the context of politics was
transformed. <em>The debate between reform and revolution could now be
in practice.</em> Also the trade union leaders now looked to their
resources and organisation instead of tailing the openly capitalist parties.</p>

<p>But there was a major debit on the balance sheet. Electoral
progress was being sought without a corresponding politic advance at
the base. This could only be achieved <em>by sacrifice socialist
ideals of the left-wing.</em> The SDF were not prepared the price and
left the LRC in August 1901. Alas, they had no intention of creating
a fighting alternative to Labour&#8217;s politics and returned to the
sectarian wilderness from whence they came.</p>

<p>The effect on the ILP was equally serious. These socialists became
hostages of the union bureaucracy. An &#8216;Alliance&#8217; in one partner
controls between 94 and 99 per cent of the votes was hardly
even-handed, but the ILP was bound hand and foot to it.</p>
<p>At least the ILP had tempered its scramble to win parliamentary
seats with socialist propaganda. The LRC appealed openly and covertly
to the Liberals to help it into parliament. As the <strong>Clarion</strong>
wrote in 1902:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the great work of the official section of the ILP at the
present seems not so much to push Socialism as to try to intrigue
some half a dozen persons into Parliament. There is probably not more
than one place in Britain (if there is one) where we can get a
Socialist into Parliament without some arrangement with Liberalism,
and for such an arrangement Liberalism will demand a terribly heavy
price &#8211; more than we can possibly afford. <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The precarious influence of the ILP was demonstrated by the
meteoric rise of David Shackleton, the textile union leader. His
United Textile Factory Workers&#8217; Association had sponsored a
Tory-Labour candidate as recently as 1899. Shackleton himself was no
socialist, but a Liberal who had been offered the union&#8217;s support
in an LRC candidacy. He had been Liberal ward secretary in Accrington
and was &#8216;a very mild spoken gentleman with ideas very little in
advance of the average Liberal.&#8217; <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a>
When a by-election occurred in Clitheroe in 1902 the ILP hungered
after the nomination, but stepped aside for Shackleton, who so little
offended the main political parties that he was returned unopposed.</p>

<p>Shackleton then came within a hair&#8217;s breadth of leading the
Labour Party when it first became a serious force in 1906. Both he
and Keir Hardie stood for chairman of the Parliamentary Labour group.
Hardie was &#8216;by every qualification of service and experience ...
the outstanding candidate for Chairman. He was the senior MP, he was
the revered leader of the ILP, and he had done more than any other
individual to bring the Labour Party into existence.&#8217; <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a>
A show of hands among the MPs produced a tie. A secret ballot was no
different. The deadlock was only broken when a third vote gave Hardie
a majority of one. Shackleton returned to his true political home
when he took an administrative job in the Liberal government.</p>

<p>The fact that the Labour Party had been created from above meant
that <em>the process of political clarification,</em> which depended
not only on a separate organisation but open criticism of Liberals
and Tories alike, <em>was actually held back.</em> The compromises of
the founding conference therefore could not generate a serious mass
critique of capitalism, even on a reformist basis.</p>
<p>For all its shortcomings, the ILP represented some of the most
advanced workers in Britain at that time. The hope for socialism
depends largely on the ability of the vanguard of the class to lead
the mass of workers forward (if not immediately to revolution, at
least into fighting for reforms). The Labour Party did not provide
leadership in that sense. Indeed, it reversed the equation.</p>

<p><em>The advanced workers were subordinated to the more backward</em>,
not only because of the tendency of the union officials to go at
the pace of the slowest workers, but because the ILP was compromised
for electoral gain even more extensively than before.</p>
<p>The birth of Labour, like every other aspect of reformism, was a
mixed blessing. For the mass of workers, the existence of an
organisation linked to the trade unions and different, if only in the
vaguest manner, from the openly bourgeois parties, was an
improvement. For the minority of advanced workers, who unfortunately
accepted the electoralist strategy of Labour, the new organisation
was a millstone around their necks. What was gained in breadth was
lost in political depth.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The impact of parliament</h4>

<p class="fst">In 1906 what Herbert Morrison was to call &#8216;the miracle of
politics&#8217; <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a> &#8211; the climb of
Labour towards government office &#8211; began in earnest. The general
election sent 29 Labour MPs to parliament with 346,000 votes behind
them. [Significantly, the vast majority of successful candidates &#8211;
24 in all &#8211; had got through because they had not had to run against
Liberals. The precise voting figure were: the LRC received 331,280
votes; the Scottish Worker Representation Committee, soon to merge
itself into the national Labour Party, polled 14,878; the SDF and
Socialist independents collected 24,473 and the &#8216;Lib-Labs&#8217;,
mainly miners, accounted for another 100,000 or so out of a vote of
just under 6 million. <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a>]</p>

<p>The capitalist parties felt their long parliamentary monopoly
threatened. The Tory leader, Balfour, denounced this &#8216;echo of the
same movement which had produced riots at St. Petersburg, riots in
London, and Socialist processions in Berlin.&#8217; <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a>
An Anti-Socialist Union was hastily launched to save civilisation and
the <strong>Daily Express</strong> carried such horrifying stories as: <em>Driven
mad by Socialism &#8211; suicide of a lad of sixteen</em> and <em>Socialism
in the Kitchen Spreading Discontent among Servants</em>. In a
desperate attempt to halt the contagion and prevent a socialist
meeting in their town, Cambridge students kidnapped Keir Hardie, or
so they thought. But they had only seized a cunningly disguised
look-alike. <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a></p>

<p>Red scares are too constant a feature of Labour&#8217;s history to be
dismissed as complete lunacy or propaganda. As Trotsky says, for some
members of the ruling class the fear is &#8216;that behind the
mock-heroic threats of the Labour Party there lies the real danger
from the deeply stirring proletarian masses.&#8217; <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a>
The bosses&#8217; press was right to fear the working class but it was
stupid to believe that Labour represented that revolutionary
potential. As the president of the 1902 Labour Conference had already
affirmed: &#8216;Our policy is to take away the food of sedition.&#8217; <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a></p>

<p>Indeed the success of 1906 was to take the logic of reformism an
important step forwards. <em>Every advance made the political
compromise with capitalism less theoretical and more real.</em>
Nowhere was this better illustrated than in parliament.</p>

<p class="quoteb">First we expected &#8216;the best platform in Europe&#8217; as is
the British House of Commons, to be used in season and out of season.
Instead, we found a disinclination to use it and instead an
inclination &#8216;to get the tone of the House.&#8217; We expected, naively
enough, that our MPs would regard themselves not only as leaders and
inspirers, but as the interpreters of the movement behind them and
the mouthpieces of the dumb masses ... Instead we found ... the
spectacle of forceful speakers ... reduced to babbling impotency in
their endeavours to ape the statesman. <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Snowden, dubbed &#8216;Yorkshire&#8217;s Robespierre&#8217; wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I remember so well ... the early days of this new
Parliament ... Old members smiled at the impatience of the new
members. They reminded us of the time when they first came to
parliament full of an earnest enthusiasm to achieve some good
purpose; but despair had entered into their hearts, and before the
advent of the Labour men, they had resigned all hope of ever being
able to move that cumbersome machine at any reasonable rate along the
path of reform. <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This feeling of impotence was perhaps the most insidious of the
Commons&#8217; influences.</p>

<p>A second powerful corrupting element was the enticing atmosphere
of this &#8216;most exclusive club in Europe&#8217;. J.H. Thomas, the railway
union leader quickly fell victim: &#8216;Very early in my experience as
an MP I came to appreciate the greatness of the admittedly great, the
broadmindedness of the House of Commons as a whole.&#8217; <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a>
In a party which renounced class consciousness, such a &#8216;broadminded&#8217;
approach favourably compared with workers who, alas, imagined they
had some grievance against exploiters. In the Commons:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There was no snobbery, no side. A man was and is welcomed
there for his character and brains and not for the amount of his income.</p>

<p class="quote">I remember wishing that grades could be as easily
overlooked in the trade union movement as they were in the House of
Commons.&#8217; <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Perhaps quoting an arch-right-winger like Thomas is unfair. What
about the ferocious Davie Kirkwood, munitions shop steward, leader of
the Clyde Workers&#8217; Committee, deported from Glasgow for denouncing
wartime industrial slavery, and from 1922 one of the dreaded
&#8216;Clyde-brigade&#8217; which descended like a Jacobite horde on the
peaceful environs of Westminster?</p>

<p class="quoteb">It was a strange House. To me it was full of wonder. I
had to shake myself occasionally as I found myself moving about and
talking with men whose names were household words. More strange was
it to find them all so simple and unaffected and friendly. In the
House of Commons there is no snobbery.</p>

<p class="fst">After Kirkwood launched a violent attack on the unemployment
policy of Bonar Law, the latter bearded him in the corridor to say:
&#8216;You Clyde boys were pretty hard on me today. But it&#8217;s fine to
hear your Glasgow accent. It&#8217;s like a sniff of the air of Scotland
in the musty atmosphere of this place.&#8217; ... &#8216;What could a man do
in the face of such a greeting?&#8217; said Kirkwood.&#8217; <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a>
What indeed!</p>

<p>The party was disarmed. Snowden remembered that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It was rather amusing to see the Labour members, whose
advent to Parliament was expected to outrage all the
conventionalities, performing [parliamentary] custom[s] with more
correctness than the Tory members. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There was even a apocryphal story about a Liberal member who
attended the Commons in a soft hat instead of a topper, because he
did not want to be mistaken for a Labour MP. <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a></p>

<p>The degenerative effect of parliament had nothing to do with the
nostrum that &#8216;all power corrupts&#8217;. On the contrary, <em>it was the
very lack of power in the place for which they had sold so much to
reach, that caused such degradation</em>.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Taming conference</h4>

<p class="fst">The first art of the MPs was to create the <em>Parliamentary Labour
Party.</em> The significance of this must be understood. McKenzie
explains: &#8216;The term &#8220;The Labour Party&#8221; is properly applied only
to the mass organization of the party <em>outside</em> Parliament; it
supports in Parliament a distinct and separate organization, &#8220;The
Parliamentary Labour Party&#8221;.&#8217; <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a></p>

<p>Much of the history of Labour revolves around <em>the struggle for
dominance between the party leadership centred in the PLP and its
supporters outside</em>. The two poles of class aspiration and the
politics of the nation exist side by side in reformism. Nevertheless,
from the moment of its birth the PLP asserted its right to ignore the
membership.</p>

<p>The reformist loves to deride Marxism as dogmatic. But the logic
of reformism is a hard master, and it now dictated that the
activists, once they had lifted MPs into the Commons, must become
passive spectators of the mighty. <em>Labour Conference, almost the
only arena where the MPs&#8217; activities might be questioned, was the
first victim of electoral triumph.</em></p>

<p>The LRC changed its name to the Labour Party 1906. Its executive
decided to present the 1907 Conference with a motion stating that
resolutions could do no more than &#8216;register the opinions of the
conference without prejudice to any future course of action that may
be considered advisable by the Party in Parliament.&#8217; <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a>
But this was too blatant. As someone told Eduard Bernstein, father of
German Revisionism: &#8216;My dear Ede, one does not say these things,
one simply does them.&#8217; <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a> In the
end the motion was never debated. Pete Curran, an ILP trade unionist,
insisted that the executive amend its own resolution.</p>

<p>The final wording deleted the offending phrase, replacing it with
this: &#8216;the time and method of giving effect to [conference
decisions] are left to the Party in the House in conjunction with the
National Executive.&#8217; <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a> This gave
the PLP all it wanted.</p>

<p>The conference debate was remarkable given the short time the
Labour Party had had to sell out. The Engine Men&#8217;s delegate &#8216;said
that they found members going to the House of Commons not only
disregarding the instructions given them but absolutely voting
against the registered wish of conference. He thought they had a
right to be suspicious of actions like those.&#8217; A Workers&#8217; Union
representative concurred: &#8216;The Conference and not the Parliamentary
Party should decide the Parliamentary business.&#8217; <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a>
But true to form, the union bureaucracy backed their political
brothers and the motion passed by 642,000 to 252,000.</p>

<p>The 1907 debates forced the PLP to clarify relations with the
extra-parliamentary bodies. Snowden&#8217;s conclusions were direct:</p>

<p class="quoteb">My experience of Conferences has taught me to attach very
little importance to their resolutions. Of the hundreds of
resolutions I have seen passed by Labour conferences outlining a
drastic programme of reform, I can hardly call to mind one which has
had any practical result. Conferences will talk; let them talk.
Governments, including Labour Governments, dispose of Conference
resolutions ... The rank and file of the Labour Party ought to have
learnt the lesson by now. They have had enough experience of the
futility of conference resolutions. <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Sixty years later the experience of the Labour governments under
Harold Wilson and James Callaghan decisively confirmed Snowden&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>The subordinate position of conference followed remorselessly once
the idea was accepted firstly that parliament <em>is genuinely
representative of the masses</em> and secondly that <em>it is the only
acceptable arena for carrying through change</em>. MacDonald put it
succinctly when he said the important thing is &#8216;not what a
Socialist meeting declares itself anxious to do, but what the
community [the electorate] is prepared to do.&#8217; <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a></p>

<p>Straight after the 1907 Conference Henderson explained that MPs
were not responsible to Conference: &#8216;I have the strongest wish to
respect the findings of the conference. I must however have some
regard to those I directly represent in Parliament. This is an aspect
of our position not sufficiently kept in mind ...&#8217; <a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a>
The idea of a &#8216;constituency interest&#8217; is just as spurious as that
of the &#8216;national interest&#8217;. Since workers can only make serious
progress at the expense of the capitalists, and conversely,
capitalists live only by the daily sweat and toil of those they
exploit, <em>both cannot be represented at the same time</em>. If an MP
truly wishes to act in the interest of his working class
constituents, he can do no more than tell them that parliament is a
sham and that real power in society lies with capital and the
unelected monopolists of physical violence &#8211; the police, army and prisons.</p>

<p>A week after these words from Henderson, Hardie emphasised another
point: &#8216;rigidly laying down the lines which the Party must follow
... is the road to ruin. If the party in the House of Commons is to
succeed it must be free to select its own course ... only those on
the spot, whose finger is on the pulse of Parliament can decide ...
No conference meeting at Hull or Belfast or Derby or Newcastle can
undertake this task ...&#8217; <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a> Again
the logic of reformism dictates; everything bows before the Palace of
Westminster. [Trade unionists had by this time become accustomed to
the rule of bureaucracy, but its rise in the ILP, as a result of the
pressure of parliamentarism, was new and striking. Writing in 1908
Russell Smart and Alfred Salter accused the inner ring of NAC of
oligarchy: &#8216;To all intents these few men <em>are</em> the party.
Conference to them is merely an interlude in which a number of
delegates meet together to enjoy an annual holiday, to discuss a vast
number of unimportant matters, and go through the unnecessary
formality of re-electing them to office year after year ... The evil
has been accentuated since the general election. Questions of
national policy fall more and more into the hands of the
Parliamentary members of the council; the divisional members can
exercise as little control over the inner ring as the &#8216;inferior&#8217;
members of a Government exercise control over the cabinet Ministers
...&#8217; <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a></p>

<p>The PLP was now firmly embedded in the parliamentary game, but
what benefits did all that sacrifice of principle bring? The only
notable Labour gain in its first quarter of a century was the
reversal of Taff Vale by the 1906 Trades Disputes Act. Labour first
thought of amending the law <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a> but an
outraged TUC excluded people like Webb who proposed this, and
insisted that outright abolition was needed. In the end it was the
support of the Liberal prime minister that got the measure through.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Poodles of Liberalism</h4>

<p class="fst">Apart from the Trades Disputes Act, Labour&#8217;s parliamentary
record remained dismal. Between 1907 and 1914, the party appeared to
all and sundry as the pathetic tail pretending to wag the Liberal
dog. In the years 1906 and 1908 Labour MPs backed the government in
86 per cent of all divisions. <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a></p>

<p>After 1910 the trickle of opportunism became a flood. That year
Labour, boosted by the affiliation of the miners, rose to 42 MPs. But
the Liberals lost their commanding majority and only remained in
office with Labour support. This should have given the party the whip
hand. Hardie saw Labour copying the Irish MPs and forming &#8216;a
separate voting bloc prepared to sell its votes to the highest
bidder&#8217;. <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a> But he forgot that the
Irish had been a powerful independent pressure group because they
wanted Home Rule. The Labour MPs on the other hand wanted to rule
from Westminster and so were wedded to parliament and its procedures.
So far from the Labour group pressuring the Liberal government, they
were consistently blackmailed to back it up.</p>

<p>The second factor was the Osborne Judgement, a legal ruling which
prevented unions from paying Labour&#8217;s political levy, leaving the
party short of funds with which to fight any future contests. This
was a compelling reason for Labour to vote with the Liberals at any
price. The Liberal chief whip reported in 1910: &#8216;Throughout this
period I was always able to count on the support of the Labour
Party.&#8217; <a href="#n83" name="f83">[83]</a></p>

<p>MacDonald drew the political conclusions. If change was gradual
and depended on votes, then the fact that the majority voted Liberal
surely meant that the best place to be was the Liberal Party itself.
By 1910 MacDonald was publicly questioning whether the Labour Party
might not do better as a ginger group of the Liberals? He wrote: &#8216;it
is impossible to maintain a pure and simple Socialist Party ... the
Labour Party ... will probably fulfil itself by being the creative
centre of a much more powerful political movement.&#8217; <a href="#n84" name="f84">[84]</a>
In the same vein he claimed that &#8216;under British conditions, a
Socialist Party is the last, not the first form of the Socialist
movement in politics.&#8217; <a href="#n85" name="f85">[85]</a></p>

<p>The problems were illustrated daily in the Commons. Whether it was
the House of Lords blocking Liberal social reforms, unemployment, or
the Insurance Act, Labour took a position barely distinguishable from
and sometimes to the right of many Liberal MPs. Supporters asked in
dismay: &#8216;How can the man in the street, whom we are continually
importuning to forsake his old political associations, ever be led to
believe that the Labour Party is in any way different to the Liberal
Party, when this sort of thing is recurring.&#8217; <a href="#n86" name="f86">[86]</a></p>

<p>This behaviour was tragic, but for the bourgeois press it had its
comic side:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Labour members ... talk valiantly on platforms about
their independence ... But in the House itself they are as obedient
as trained poodles ... they line into the right lobby with a
subservience which is entertaining.</p>

<p class="quote">Parliamentarians recall one famous day when the Labour
Party led by Mr Ramsay MacDonald proposed what practically amounted
to a vote of censure on the Government for not paying fair wages in
Government works. But they gasped for breath when ... Mr Ramsay
MacDonald scuttled. [Fearing a Liberal defeat] he would not support
his own motion ... It is conduct like this which has caused the
working man holding forward political opinions to suspect that the
Labour gentlemen at Westminster are bamboozling them. <a href="#n87" name="f87">[87]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The farcical state into which Labour had fallen was shown when
Labour MPs officially decided they should not vote according to the
merits of an issue, but only to keep the Liberals in office!</p>
<p>This was hardly a golden age.</p>

<p>The degradation did not stop there. Labour came within a hair&#8217;s
breadth of entering a coalition with the Liberals. This was raised in
1910 but judged premature. In 1911 MacDonald was in serious
discussions with leading Liberals over the possibility. <a href="#n88" name="f88">[88]</a>
In 1914 Fenner Brockway made these machinations public at the ILP
Conference. <a href="#n89" name="f89">[89]</a> In fact a coalition
including Liberals, Labour and the Tories was just around the comer,
but the excuse for this was rather more convincing than the previous
ones &#8211; the World War.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Left alternatives</h4>

<p class="fst">Labour&#8217;s abject position sent a wave of anger across the left.
There have always been two very different reactions against the
degeneration caused by electoralism. One was a turn towards mass
militancy, which involved a practical rejection of parliamentary
methods. The other can be called the <em>eternal Labour left.</em> It
is eternal because reformist politics always involves compromising
with capitalism. Ralph Miliband describes the aims of Labour&#8217;s left thus:</p>

<p class="quoteb">to push their leaders into accepting more radical
policies and programmes, and to press upon them more militant
attitudes in response to challenges from labour&#8217;s opponents. The
Labour Left&#8217;s own acceptance of the categories of the parliamentary
system has been distinguished from that of the leadership by a
continuous search for means of escape from its inhibitions and
constrictions. What the Labour leaders have accepted eagerly the
Labour Left has accepted with a certain degree of unease and at times
with acute misgivings. <a href="#n90" name="f90">[90]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Acute misgivings maybe, but <em>it has always accepted.</em> It
shakes its chains but remains a willing prisoner of the machine.</p>

<p>The organised left presence in the Labour Party dates from the
election in 1907 of Victor Grayson who shot like a comet across the
horizon of Labour politics and then fizzled out. His eventual
disappearance remains an unexplained mystery. <a href="#n91" name="f91">[91]</a>
Grayson stood as &#8216;Labour and <em>Socialist</em>&#8217; in the Colne
Valley by-election. To the Labour leadership this was a crime.
Socialism was acceptable in private but should not obtrude into
electoral business.</p>

<p>Grayson was not a revolutionary, but he was militantly reformist.
While others saw in parliament the broadmindedness of the &#8216;admittedly
great&#8217;, he saw only an &#8216;ancient Chamber ... swaddled in the
mediaeval vestments of pompous and now meaningless procedure ... The
legislative machine is exquisitely devised to prevent, or at least
render difficult, any change in stereotyped institutions.&#8217; <a href="#n92" name="f92">[92]</a>
Parliament could only be used as a propaganda platform from which to
arouse those outside. In 1908, he was expelled from the Commons for
accusing MPs of conniving at murder by allowing poverty to continue.</p>

<p>Grayson lost his seat in 1910 and broke away to form the British
Socialist Party (which, though dominated by the former SDF,
incorporated dissident ILP branches and Blatchford&#8217;s <strong>Clarion</strong>
movement). But criticisms of Labour continued from within. Tillett
wrote a pamphlet whose title, <strong>Is the Parliamentary Labour Party a
Failure?</strong> is self-explanatory. A group of ILP members issued the
so-called &#8216;Green Manifesto&#8217; <strong>Let Us Reform the Labour Party</strong>.
Its tone was urgent. The Labour Party was facing &#8216;a crisis touching
its very vitals&#8217;. This had been brought about by &#8216;the
Lazarus-like attitude of many of the members, and the suicidal
&#8220;Revisionist&#8221; policy accepted by all of the members of the
Parliamentary Labour Group.&#8217; This had &#8216;reduced the whole Movement
to acute anaemia or rabid melancholy.&#8217; <a href="#n93" name="f93">[93]</a>
Many senior Labour MPs, including Hardie and Snowden, openly
ridiculed the policy prevailing under the MacDonald leadership.
Snowden declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Unless the Labour Party has a distinct point of
view...unless it can show that it is anxious to go farther than, or
in a different way to, the Liberals, there is no reason for its
existence as a separate party. It would be difficult for the observer
to find from the attitude of the PLP wherein its position on
questions of taxation differs from that of the Liberal Party. <a href="#n94" name="f94">[94]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the end, however, the campaign by Grayson and those that
followed him had minimal impact. It had been fatally flawed from the
start, and this was revealed as early as 1909. At that year&#8217;s ILP
Conference the mettle of the left was tested. MacDonald set the stage
by suggesting parliamentary procedures were more important than the
plight of the unemployed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The existence of democratic government is just as
essential to the building up of the Socialist State as is the
solution of the problem of unemployment ... The Party which proposes
to strike at the heart of democratic government in order to make a
show of earnestness about unemployment will not only not be tolerated
by the country, but does not deserve to be. <a href="#n95" name="f95">[95]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Hardie nailed his colours to the mast when he leapt up to announce
that MacDonald was &#8216;the biggest intellectual asset which the
Socialist movement has.&#8217;</p>

<p>When a vote went against the leadership and in favour of Grayson
the ILP &#8216;Big Four&#8217; &#8211; Hardie, Macdonald, Snowden and Bruce
Glasier dropped a bombshell &#8211; they resigned. The response was
immediate. Cross describes how one delegate &#8216;moved a resolution so
obsequious that even now it takes one&#8217;s breath away.&#8217; <a href="#n96" name="f96">[96]</a>
Only ten delegates voted against this tearful plea for the leaders to
stay on. But the Big Four let their decision stand. They doubted the
continuing need for an ILP. Glasier felt: &#8216;We must only save the
Party if it is worth saving,&#8217; and of this he was not certain.&#8217;
<a href="#n97" name="f97">[97]</a></p>

<p>The ILP had outlived its usefulness. Its enthusiasm had helped
create the PLP, but now this body wanted passive obedience, not an
organisation telling it how to behave. Russell Smart, an astute
left-winger, realised this:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Is it our part in the fight merely to provide the funds,
get recruits, and follow our leaders? ... For the last few years the
Junta pursued a policy which had steadily and stealthily deprived the
branches of their autonomy and increased the power of the centre ...
we are merely the ladder by which clever, and at a later date
self-seeking politicians may climb into office. <a href="#n98" name="f98">[98]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There was a fundamental difficulty facing the Labour left. In
accepting parliamentary change they had ultimately to bow down before
the parliamentarians. Lenin regarded &#8216;direct struggle of the masses
... as the highest form of the movement, and parliamentary activity
... as the lowest form.&#8217; <a href="#n99" name="f99">[99]</a> Now
this is either true or it is not. If it is true, then <em>the workers&#8217;
needs</em>, their self-confidence and their capacity to fight, <em>come
first, and parliamentary manoeuvres are secondary.</em> If, on the
other hand, Macdonald was right, then <em>parliamentary influence
outweighs everything.</em> Macdonald put these alternatives in his
replies to Grayson:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We ask you to find money for the establishment and
maintenance of a serious and intelligent and determined body of men
who use the House of Commons in order that they may work through it,
not merely demonstrate through it ... <a href="#n100" name="f100">[100]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The outside left</h4>

<p class="fst">Labour&#8217;s final emergence from the cocoon of Liberalism owed
nothing to its own efforts, or even those of the left. It arose from
the second, and far more serious alternative to Labourism, the
&#8216;Labour Unrest&#8217; of 1910&#8211;1914. The new unionism of 1889 created
a forward movement which, though deflated into reformist channels,
gave the impetus for a real break with Lib-Labism. Since then, no
mass ideological advance had been made, which partly explained the
permanent tendency of the Labour Party to collapse into the arms of
the Liberals.</p>

<p>The class struggles that began in 1910 and continued until 1921
provided the springboard for the next major development in labour
politics. We move from an alliance of the reformist ILP minnow with
the trade union whale of basically Liberal persuasion, to a <em>mass
reformist party.</em> Once more the Labour leaders are found tailing
the class (where not actually obstructing it) and again the
translation of struggle into electoral politics is both indirect and
assisted by the weak position of the revolutionary, left.</p>

<p>In the &#8216;Labour Unrest&#8217; of 1910 to 1914 the working class
returned to the stage of history with a ferocity which terrified the
Labour Party as much as the ruling class. These years saw the first
national strikes of miners, dockers and railwaymen. Within four years
trade union membership doubled, and strike days quadrupled.
Merseyside&#8217;s Bloody Sunday, 13 August 1911 captured the spirit of
the time. A mass demonstration of 80,000 striking transport workers
was attacked by police and military. Driven into the city:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the residents in many instances took sides with the
rioters against the police, throwing bottles, bricks, slates and
stones from the houses and from the roofs. The whole area was for a
time in a state of siege. <a href="#n101" name="f101">[101]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Two days later a couple of strikers were shot dead. The same
happened at Llanelli where two more were killed.</p>

<p>These events were precipitated by a continuing decline in British
capitalism&#8217;s competitive position, rising prices and a drop in
unemployment. Once again the role of revolutionaries was central.
They were inspired by the theory of syndicalism. As one delegate told
the 1912 Trades Union Congress: &#8216;Let us be quite clear as to what
Syndicalism really is ... a protest against the inaction of the Labour
Party.&#8217; <a href="#n102" name="f102">[102]</a></p>

<p>This was borne out by syndicalist writings. Tom Mann&#8217;s
<strong>Industrial Syndicalist</strong>, <strong>The Miners&#8217; Next Step</strong> and
other works carried the same rejection of &#8216;politics&#8217;, understood
as Labour&#8217;s reformism. Leaflets such as this were typical: &#8216;Leaders
only want your votes; they will sell you. They lie, Parliament lies
and will not help you, but is trying to sell you. Don&#8217;t touch a
tool till you get your minimum. Win, win, win!&#8217; <a href="#n103" name="f103">[103]</a>
And win they did in a number of mighty disputes.</p>

<p>The <strong>Weekly Despatch</strong> explained what had occurred:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The fact is that the Labour representatives, from their
own point of view, become demoralised when they enter Parliament ...
Their friends in the constituencies who expect so many things from
the Labour Party are disappointed. The consequence is that the men
outside, the real leaders of labour agitation, are going instead
without paying the slightest attention to their parliamentary
representatives. They realise, though, rather late, the Labour Party
is but an appendage of the Liberal Party.</p>

<p class="fst">The truth was that the parliamentary game of the party was
irrelevant to the daily needs of the class:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It has no effect on the matters most important to Labour;
wages did not rise, the price of necessities of life increased ... It
is enough to state that [the Labour Party] has no influence on those
vital issues. <a href="#n104" name="f104">[104]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A brake on the movement</h4>

<p class="fst">The reaction of the Labour Party to the unrest was highly
informative. First, as has been noted, <em>it did absolutely nothing
to develop the mass militancy.</em> Although a great number of Labour
Party supporters must have been caught up in strike action, on no
occasion were they acting <em>as Labour Party members,</em> but rather
in spite of that fact.</p>

<p>As a force for taking the Labour Unrest forward, or shaping it in
a positive direction, the Labour Party was totally and utterly
irrelevant. The President of the Board of Trade, the government&#8217;s
chief conciliation service, told the cabinet of:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the almost complete collapse of the Labour Party in the
House as an effective influence in labour disputes. They were not
consulted with regard to and had no share in the Seamen&#8217;s or
Transport Workers&#8217; movement last summer. During the railway strike,
they attempted to act as a go-between for the men and the Government.
But they had very little influence over the actions of the men, or on
the result ... the Labour Party exercised no influence at all.</p>

<p>And he added a significant rider: &#8216;Their elimination is a
distinct loss to industrial peace.&#8217; <a href="#n105" name="f105">[105]</a></p>

<p>In the early stages even the union bureaucracy were extremely
anxious to exclude the Labour leaders from any involvement. MacDonald
complained about the Miners&#8217; executive: &#8216;Not only did it hold
itself aloof from the Labour Party in parliament, but it sought
virtually to interdict the Labour members from expressing on public
platforms any views concerning the situation or the government
negotiations ... This surely was Syndicalism <em>in excelsis</em>!
<a href="#n106" name="f106">[106]</a></p>

<p>It is easy to see why Labour should not have been consulted, for
if they had been, this was the advice MacDonald proffered:</p>
<p class="quoteb">If we had been consulted first of all we should have
advised the men to begin with Parliamentary action, both on the floor
of the House of Commons, and in Ministers&#8217; private rooms ... whilst
the heroics outside are being indulged in, Parliamentary action of a
general character is being paralysed and prejudiced. <a href="#n107" name="f107">[107]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The party was not ignored because it had nothing to say. It
commented in speeches, newspapers and books &#8211; with a barrage of
abuse beside Which Thatcherite attacks on the right to Strike begin
to pale. The May 1912 issue of the ILP&#8217;s <strong>Socialist Review</strong>
described strikes as &#8216;an apocalypse overspreading the social
firmament.&#8217; <a href="#n108" name="f108">[108]</a> Supporters of
direct action formed &#8216;a percentage of the population [Which] is
mentally defective. [They are] not a subject of discussion but of
pathological treatment.&#8217; Glasier&#8217;s pamphlet. <strong>Socialism and
Strikes</strong> began by saying that &#8216;among the many curious and, at
first sight inexplicable customs of civilisation, that of industrial
strikes seems one of the most extraordinary.&#8217; To stop work &#8216;is
culpable, comprehensible fatuity.&#8217; <a href="#n109" name="f109">[109]</a></p>

<p>However this attitude was not out-and-out reactionary. Labour&#8217;s
leaders did not explicitly side with the bosses. They wished to be
neutral and for the state to rise above class warfare. To the
belligerents they said &#8216;a plague on both your houses&#8217;. Thus
during the bitter struggle in 1913 of Jim Larkin and the Dublin
workers against a ruthless anti-union boss, Glasier condemned the two
sides for showing &#8216;the same wilful anarchistic temperament&#8217; They
were &#8216;the upper ... and lower jaw of the same clinch.&#8217; <a href="#n110" name="f110">[110]</a>
It might have looked like that from the offices of the ILP; on the
ground the impression was startlingly different. Larkin replied that
these political leaders had &#8216;sold the cause of Labour, besmirched
the flag, dragged it down in the dirt.&#8217; <a href="#n111" name="f111">[111]</a></p>

<p>Tillett ridiculed the idea that the capitalist state was neutral.
He described the events of 1912 as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">... strikes ... police intimidation, coercion, brutality,
riot, imprisonment; Home Secretary intervenes with armed forces,
attempts at suppression, Cossack methods of the Home Office forces.
Parliament dumb and acquiescent, Labour Party impotent where not
indifferent ... Parliament is a farce and a sham, the rich man&#8217;s
Duma, the employer&#8217;s Tammany, the Thieves&#8217; Kitchen and the
working man&#8217;s despot ... In the 1912 strikes we had to fight
Parliament, the forces of the Crown, the judges of the law ... <a href="#n112" name="f112">[112]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Labour Unrest showed that in major class struggles Labour
<em>sides with the state and stands for the preservation of capitalist
society.</em> Thus in 1912 the ILP&#8217;s <strong>Socialist Review</strong> wrote:
&#8216;Society is exposed to well nigh mortal injury ... the well-being
of the whole nation is at the mercy of the workmen ...&#8217; <em>Whatever
the provocation, </em>such strikes could never be excused: &#8216;How then
is the nation to deal with a menace of such almost incredible
coercion &#8211; a coercion which is altogether apart ... from the
question of the justifiability of the claims of the workers.&#8217; <a href="#n113" name="f113">[113]</a>
Macdonald, famed as the &#8216;man who could conceal an ounce of meaning
in a ton of verbiage&#8217; <a href="#n114" name="f114">[114]</a>
suddenly managed to speak with crystal clarity. &#8216;Syndicalism is
largely a revolt against Socialism [by which he meant the Labour
Party]. Socialism must be Parliamentary or it is nothing.&#8217; The
choice was indeed class or nation: &#8216;There is, therefore, a real
unity called a nation, which endows the individual with traditions,
with habits, with a system of social conduct. The Syndicalist ...
lays it down that this national inheritance is unreal, is nothing &#8211;
can build up no policy upon it.&#8217; <a href="#n115" name="f115">[115]</a></p>

<p>However the reaction was not uniform. Some ILP leaders professed
sympathy for strikes, <em>only the more effectively to restrain them</em>.
Witness the byzantine sophistry of Keir Hardie at this time:
parliamentary action &#8216;is revolutionary, whereas direct action is
but palliative ... A general strike against Liberalism and Toryism is
the need of the hour. The industrial strike, even when successful
settles nothing ... The political strike [by which Hardie meant
voting Labour] is the only form of strike which is all gain and no
loss. <a href="#n116" name="f116">[116]</a> The ability of reformists
to talk left, when the moment requires, should never be
underestimated. In 1912, ignoring the ILP&#8217;s entire history, Hardie declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The ILP ... is not a reform organisation; it is
revolutionary in the fullest sense of the word. The ILP does not
exist to patch up the present order of society so that it may be made
a little more tolerable; it exists to overthrow the present order ...
Comrades of the working class, we do not want Parliament to give us
reforms. We are not asking Parliament to do things for us. We are
going to Parliament ourselves to master Parliament. <a href="#n117" name="f117">[117]</a></p>

<p class="fst">An interesting pattern was developing. The left wing at the 1900
founding conference &#8211; the ILP, <em>was now to the right.</em> Most
ILP leaders, professionally linked with the concept of &#8216;nation&#8217;
and distanced from collective pressure outside parliament, were now
<em>far more conservative than their counterparts in the union bureaucracy.</em></p>

<p>By 1910 there was a group of professional reformists &#8211; the PLP,
who had a material interest in resisting strikes. History does not
stand still. In the 1890s <em>reformist politicians were in advance of
the class.</em> From 1910 this was no longer true. The &#8216;Labour
Unrest&#8217; showed them not only far behind the working class, but a
<em>conscious hindrance</em> to its advance.</p>

<p>Something else should be noted. Although union leaders ultimately
blocked action they had to be <em>far more sensitive to direct class
pressure from the workplaces.</em> Both left and right-wing officials
needed left rhetoric to keep any control and realised that close
association with the discredited, passive Labour Party would damage
them in the eyes of a rank and file already prepared to act unofficially.</p>

<p>Thus the NUR&#8217;s <strong>Railway Review</strong>, the paper of the
right-wing Jimmy Thomas, denounced a particularly obnoxious Labour
attack entitled <em>Stop the Strike</em> which described stoppages as
&#8216;essentially an abortion&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">How simple the whole matter is ... What a magnanimous
disregard for the social relations in which this takes place and is
conditioned! With a single generalisation the capitalist mode of
production is waved out of existence ... Landlord, capitalist and
wage-labourer have disappeared.&#8217; <a href="#n118" name="f118">[118]</a></p>

<p class="fst">At this point the interests of the labour bureaucracy &#8211; the MPs
and the trade union officials &#8211; diverged, a fact highlighted by one
of the most astounding Bills ever proposed by Labour MPs. It was put
forward by a prestigious team including the previous and Current
party chairmen &#8211; Arthur Henderson and George Barnes as well as Will
Crooks [Crooks was elected in by-election in 1903 and was therefore
one of the most senior Labour MPs] and Enoch Edwards. These men, who
all had trade union connections, proposed to make it illegal to
strike without first going to a Board of Conciliation. Thirty days
notice had to be given for any &#8216;intended change affecting
conditions of employment with respect to wages or hours.&#8217; Any
worker who struck in defiance of the law would be fined &#8216;not less
than &#163;2 nor more than &#163;10 for every day or part of a day that such
<em>employee</em> is on strike.&#8217; With average weekly earnings just
over &#163;1 the real cost of the fines may be appreciated. The most
draconian part of the Bill concerned working class solidarity: &#8216;Any
person who incites, encourages or aids in any manner ... any <em>employee</em>
to go or continue on strike contrary to the provisions of this Act
shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of not less than
&#163;10 and not more than &#163;200.&#8217; <a href="#n119" name="f119">[119]</a>
An unopposed vote of censure was passed by the TUC on this proposal
in 1911, and it had to be dropped.</p>

<p>The events of 1912 reunited the union leaders and PLP once more.
The first national miners&#8217; strike plus an increasingly articulate
syndicalist challenge, led both to discover their community of
interest in resisting the workers. Robert Smillie, the veteran ILP
member and miners&#8217; leader, realised that: &#8216;During our strike ...
we got to the verge of the horror of revolution.&#8217; <a href="#n120" name="f120">[120]</a>
The shift in emphasis can be seen by comparing Labour Conferences in
January 1912 and January 1913: At the first, before the miners&#8217;
stoppage, conference unanimously approved resolutions congratulating
striking unions on their success. But the next year it had become one
long diatribe against syndicalism. The Triple Alliance of coal, rail
and transport unions was another example of the change. It began as a
response to pressure for class unity in action, but Smillie later
wanted to use it differently: &#8216;If the three bodies which have now
joined hands use their votes wisely at election times they themselves
could add 120 Members to those in the House of Commons. That is the
place where the future battle is to fought.&#8217; <a href="#n121" name="f121">[121]</a></p>

<p>The trade union bureaucracy now recognised, as Lloyd George had
done, that Labour politics could act as &#8216;the best policemen for
the Syndicalist&#8217;. <a href="#n122" name="f122">[122]</a> Indeed the
party <em>played an exceptionally important part in controlling the
movement,</em> a part belied by its apparent irrelevance. <em>It
provided the weaponry and the justification for the bureaucrats&#8217;
holding operation.</em></p>

<p>Syndicalism had no answer to the generalised political arguments
of Labour, because it rejected &#8216;politics&#8217; in principle. Its only
policy was a spontaneous general strike. Theoretical weakness did not
seem to matter when wages were the issue; but as soon as it was a
question of going beyond economic action the syndicalists found
themselves unarmed, with Labour occupying the high ground of general
ideas<em>. The syndicalists made the fatal mistake of writing off the
politics of reformism.</em></p>

<p>For the Labour Party was never simply a reactionary party like the
Tories and Liberals. It held out the promise that workers might
advance by other means than self-activity. It defended law and order,
but bemoaned the &#8216;excesses&#8217; of the police and military. <em>The
party may not have been effective in attacking capital, but it proved
valuable in defending it.</em></p>

<p>In comparison with working-class direct action, Labour&#8217;s efforts
at the polls seemed laughable. Between 1910 and 1914 it lost four
seats and came bottom of the poll in the other twelve by-elections.
Nevertheless the wider class struggle was shifting many workers to
the left, and despite the loss of seats a creeping increase in
Labour&#8217;s vote passively recorded this phenomenon.</p>

<p>However the mass basis for reformism was still restricted.
Evidence for this came with the passing of the 1913 Trade Union Act.
This amending of the Osborne Judgement required unions to take
ballots to ascertain whether to pay the political levy. The levy
received just 60 per cent of the small numbers of votes cast.[There
are precious few measures of the real significance of union
affiliation to the Labour Party. During the late 1980s Labour did
well in Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s imposed ballots on the political levy,
but we have only one other measure of active union commitment, from
1927. That year the Tories stopped automatic deduction of the levy
from dues and individuals had to &#8216;opt in&#8217;. Though this cost only
a few pence a year Labour&#8217;s trade union membership dropped by 40
per cent overnight.]</p>

<p>By 1914 the proportion of trade unionists affiliated to Labour was
lower than it had been in 1903. <a href="#n123" name="f123">[123]</a></p>

<p>Even for the most ardent of reformists Labour&#8217;s first fourteen
years must have been a grave disappointment. The working class had
rediscovered a type of do-it-yourself reformism &#8211; and had achieved
in weeks changes such as the miners&#8217; statutory minimum wage, which
years of lobbying at Westminster had failed to secure. The Labour
Party&#8217;s own efforts, by contrast, were dismal.</p>
