<h1>1. The Birth of Reformism</h1>

<br/>
<h4>The Precursors: From Chartism to the Independent Labour Party</h4>

<p class="fst">IN 1911 Ramsay MacDonald wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Labour Party ... is the only political form which
evolutionary Socialism can take in a country with the political
traditions and methods of Great Britain. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This statement is false. At different times British workers have
given mass support to political ideas that are in sharp contrast to
reformism. Only in the twentieth century were majority won to the
reformist position.</p>

<p>Between 1839 and 1848 workers supported Chartism. Unlike the
Labour Party this rejected the legal framework of existing society.
[The idea of petitioning for the &#8216;Six Points&#8217; of the Charter was
originally mooted by reformists like William Lovett. But once the
movement gained a mass basis the idea of appealing to the goodness of
the upper classes disappeared. As Thompson puts it: &#8216;the actual
collection of signatures to the petition does not seem to have been a
major preoccupation of the new groups ... It is also noticeable that
none of the recollections of ex-Chartists mentions the collection of
signatures as a remembered form of activity&#8217;. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>]
In November 1839, for example, there was an armed rising by several
thousand Chartist miners at Newport. Chartism&#8217;s most prominent
demand was for universal suffrage, but to have granted the vote when
the working class was in revolutionary mood would have mortally
threatened bourgeois society. The ruling class felt that, in the
words of Macaulay to the Commons, universal suffrage was
&#8216;incompatible with the very existence of civilisation&#8217;. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p>The Labour Party operates a strict division between trade union
officials, who take care of wages and conditions, and members of
parliament, whose concern is &#8216;politics&#8217;. In the Chartist period
there was no barrier between political and industrial activity. The
Chartist Convention of 1839 made it clear that direct action, not
canvassing, was the way forward:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Convention continues to be unanimously of the opinion
that nothing short of a general strike, or suspension of labour
through-out the country, will ever suffice to re-establish the rights
and liberties of the industrial classes. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1842 the general strike became a reality. This was the first
such strike in the world and lasted longer than the 1926 General
Strike. Half a million workers initially downed tools because of wage
cuts, but soon factory after factory declared itself &#8216;&#8220;ready to
strike for the Charter, but not for wages.&#8221; ... This was the
general line.&#8217; <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p>Chartism was unashamedly a class movement. Its demands were of
revolutionary significance and it saw workers&#8217; self-activity as the
means to winning these demands. But the movement was extinguished
after 1848: In the decades that followed social peace and imperial
prosperity prevailed. Britain had become &#8216;the work-shop of the
world.&#8217; In the boom workers were able to win a rising standard of
living.</p>

<p>The militancy and unity of earlier years broke up and the Chartist
idea of strikes as a political weapon was absolutely repudiated. In
1856, for example, the engineers&#8217; leader declared: &#8216;We do not
allow any political matter to be discussed at all nor entertained
among us.&#8217; <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> Theodore Rothstein shows
how this worked in practice:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the slogan of &#8216;No Politics&#8217; ... applied only to the
organised forms of politics based upon the class struggle. In other
words, every individual worker could privately engage in politics ...
Naturally, by thus atomising himself politically ... the English
worker fell an easy prey to the organised force of bourgeois party
ideology and became a Conservative or a Liberal. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A sign of the collapse of class politics since Chartism was the
granting of votes to men living in towns and cities in 1867. By this
means Disraeli&#8217;s Tory government hoped to buy workers&#8217;
allegiance. Twenty years earlier a similar move would have meant &#8216;the
end of civilisation&#8217;, but now Viscount Halifax reassured the House
of Lords of &#8216;the almost universal reasonableness of the working
classes...and their vast improvement of late years&#8217;. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a>
In 1884 rural male workers were also given the vote since it was
judged that they too had an unquestioning acceptance of capitalism:
Marx was scathing about British workers at this time:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The English working-class had been gradually becoming
more and more deeply demoralised by the period of corruption since
1848 and had at last got to the point when it was nothing more than
the tail of the Great Liberal Party, i.e., of its <i>oppressors</i>,
the capitalists. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1874 &#8216;the first labour MPs&#8217;, Thomas Burt and Alexander
MacDonald, were elected. Both were mining officials who stood as
Liberals. Burt opposed a separate workers&#8217; party because: &#8216;Classes
they have, and class distinctions they possibly would always have,
but they should not accentuate their class differences.&#8217; <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>
Alexander MacDonald told his union conference: &#8216;he trusted that in
their efforts to put down strikes they would accomplish a great work
for which posterity would thank them&#8217;. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a>
These two alone should have been sufficient to expire the myth that
the mere fact that workers sit in parliament represents serious
progress for the class.</p>

<p>Burt and MacDonald were known as Lib-Labs. This group never grew
into a serious force because Liberal voters preferred to elect
genuine members of the ruling class rather than union officials who
aped them. The Lib-Labs were moved to complain:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We have ever sought to be allied to the great Liberal
Party, to which we, by conviction, belong. They have not reciprocated
this feeling ... middle-class Liberals preferred voting for the
Tories rather than support a working-class candidate. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, a few Lib-Labs were elected from time to time. In
1900 there were 11 of them. There was even a union sponsored Tory-Lab
candidate, a cotton union official from Lancashire!</p>

<p>However, such MPs depended on the boom conditions that accompanied
Britain&#8217;s monopoly of world trade. Only in such a situation could
workers logically think &#8216;what is good for my boss is good for me&#8217;,
and vote for openly capitalist parties. Engels accurately predicted
that &#8216;once America and the joint competition of the other
industrial countries make a big enough breach in this monopoly ...
you will see a lot of things happen here.&#8217; <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a>
Between 1870 and 1913 Britain&#8217;s share of world trade fell from 30
per cent to 15 per cent <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a>, and in
1889 Engels was vindicated by the appearance of new unionism, which
led to a break with Lib- Labism.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>From New Unionism to reformist politics</h4>

<p class="fst">The roots of the 1889 strike wave were economic. Yet there had
been similar economic fluctuations before without any dramatic new
departures. <i>A crucial factor in the 1889 explosion was the
intervention of socialists who, though tiny in number, played a
leading role.</i> <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a> Many of them
were associated with the Marxist Social Democratic Federation (SDF).</p>

<p>The most famous incident was the &#8216;Great London Dock Strike&#8217;
led by socialists such as Tom Mann, John Burns and Ben Tillett. Until
that time dockers had been, in Engels&#8217; words, &#8216;the lowest of the
outcasts ... a mass of broken-down humanity who are drifting toward
total ruination ... this host of utterly despondent men.&#8217; <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a>
Now 30,000 dockers had paralysed the largest and wealthiest city in
the world, the hub of the biggest Empire, and won!</p>

<p>The new unions were based on unskilled or semi-skilled men and
women. It had been thought they could not be organised since they
lacked the bargaining power of craftsmen. This was proved wrong for
the new &#8216;General Unions&#8217;, unlike the old ones, looked to
organisation across the class embracing all types of worker. Old
unions put their faith in negotiation and conciliation; the new
turned to direct action with mass pickets and physical resistance to scabbing.</p>

<p>Instead of tailing bourgeois parties, the most advanced new
unionists based themselves on the power of the working class: &#8216;our
cry is still the vehement and bitter cry of labour against capital.
While we are still at war we shall hold out no flag of trace to the
capitalist until the product of our labour is ours and not his.&#8217;
<a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a> Socialists like Mann coupled the
building of union organisation with a demand for the legal eight-hour
day, to be forced from the state, thus linking the collective
strength of the working class with political demands.</p>

<p>The new unionists thus challenged the institutional separation of
politics and economics. It is through this division that the system
prevents collective struggle spilling over into a threat to its very
survival, because the state faces workers in their capacity as voters
only, as atomised individuals. Marx recognised the significance of
the campaign for a statutory eight-hour day:</p>

<p class="quoteb">every movement which the working class comes out as a
class against the ruling classes and tries to coerce them by pressure
from without is a political movement ... the attempt in a particular
factory or even in a particular trade to force a shorter working day
out of individual capitalists by strikes, etc. is a purely economic
movement. On the other hand the movement to force through an
eight-hour law is a political movement. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The old unionist leaders fought the new trend bitterly. George
Shipton, chairman of the London Trades Council, led the attack. He
condemned revolutionary political methods. Instead of mass
demonstrations designed to force concessions <i>from</i> the state,
they should work <i>through</i> it: &#8216;When the people were
un-enfranchised, were without votes, the only power left to them was
the demonstration of numbers. Now, however, the workmen have votes.&#8217;
<a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> Shipton also opposed introducing
politics into union struggles: &#8216;The &#8220;new trade unionists&#8221; look
to Governments and legislation; the &#8220;old&#8221; look to self-reliance.&#8217;
<a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>Tillett and Mann offered an equally vigorous reply which showed
where they differed both from reformist dependence on parliament and
the separation of politics and economics. They stressed workers&#8217;
self-organisation as the key to progress:</p>

<p class="quoteb">we have been at pains to discredit appeal to the
legislature, contending that the political machine will fail into our
hands as a matter of course, so soon as the educational work has been
done in our labour organisations ... The statement that the &#8220;new&#8221;
trade unionists look to governments and legislation is bunkum; the
key-note is to ORGANISE first, and take action ... <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The militant industrial activity of this period had nothing in
common with parliamentary reformism, yet within a few years this was
what it produced. How was the movement transformed?</p>

<p>The heroic phase of new unionism was short-lived. The ruling class
fought back using lockouts and mass scabbing to break the weakest
groups. This succeeded because British capitalism&#8217;s crisis was not
so deep that all sections of the working class were stirred up. The
hostility of the older unions also obstructed unity. Finally the SDF,
the main organisation on the left, was incurably sectarian. It
ignored the value of trade union activity and dismissed the dock
strike in patronising tones. In September 1889, at the very moment of
victory, it published an article entitled &#8216;The Errors of the
Strike&#8217; which said: &#8216;We congratulate the dockers on the very
little modicum of success that has been obtained at so great a cost.&#8217;
<a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p>Between 1890 and 1892 membership of the new unions fell from
320,000 to 130,000, slipping from a peak of one quarter of the Trades
Union Congress to 10 percent in 1900. The Gas Workers, the most
politically advanced, dropped from 60,000 in 1890 to 24,000 in 1896.
<a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a> Trade unionism in general suffered
a serious setback, membership falling by 40 per cent in just three years.</p>

<p>With union machines to protect, leaders like Will Thorne and Ben
Tillett rapidly adopted some of the conservative attitudes they had
criticised in the &#8216;old&#8217; union bureaucrats. In 1893 Tillett
blocked a national strike against mass scabbing at Hull docks. In
1894 Thorne &#8216;exhorted his members to rely on the advice of their
officials, declaring that &#8220;a firm stand should be made against men
coming out on strike, unless oppressed to such an extent that their
position is unbearable.&#8221;&#8217; <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p>At the start new unionist leaders had understood the need for
workers&#8217; <i>political action</i>. Reporting to the Second
International in 1891, the Gas-Workers&#8217; delegation declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The successful, like the unsuccessful strikes ... all of
the hundreds of large and small strikes of the last two years, point
to the same moral and adorn the same tale &#8211; that Trade Unionism and
Strikes alone will not emancipate the working class. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was one thing to understand the need to challenge capitalism
politically, but it was possible to draw either revolutionary or
reformist conclusions.</p>

<p>One possible direction was to use the fight for reforms, including
placing demands on parliament, <i>as a means of mobilising the
working class</i> and through this experience preparing <i>the final,
revolutionary, struggle for socialism</i>. But the reformist attitude
to parliament was <i>a means of demobilising the class</i>, asking it
to rely on leaders who avoid confrontation and work within the
system. <i>Their negotiating skills substitute for mass activity.</i></p>

<p>Alas, the sectarian attitude of the SDF meant that in the 1890s
only the latter alternative was presented, and it triumphed across
the board. Even the minority who would have accepted the
revolutionary arguments were not organised into a permanent force,
and the most advanced ideas of new unionism disappeared without trace.</p>

<p>Tom Mann was one of the last to leave the field. In June 1891 he
could still write: &#8216;the belief is quite sincerely held ... that
parliamentary action is desirable <i>as a substitute</i> for unionism
... how absurd.&#8217; <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a> But a new
attitude soon emerged. Its most public manifestation was Tillett&#8217;s
parliamentary candidature in Bradford. In 1889 and 1890 he had turned
down offers to stand. &#8216;Never mind party politics, to hell with
them&#8217;, was his comment. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> Yet in
September 1891 he accepted the candidature. The tenor of his campaign
was significant:</p>

<p class="quoteb">An avowed socialist, Tillett did not once mention the
word &#8216;socialism&#8217; during the run-up to the election ... He also
reprinted in his campaign literature the commendation he had received
from the elders of the Congregational Church: &#8216;We have reason
devoutly to thank God that our Leader of undisciplined labour is a
man like Tillett, a good soldier of Jesus Christ, and not a Marat&#8217;
... He seems to have consciously refrained from envisioning the
socialist millennium, remarking on at least three separate occasions
that he would not do so. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Tillett&#8217;s campaign symbolised a general trend among thousands of
workers. For Bradford was the clearest example of how industrial
defeat led to reformist politics. It was here that the ILP &#8211; the
Independent Labour Party &#8211; held its 1893 founding conference. This
city alone provided one sixth of the ILP&#8217;s affiliation fees, while
the West Yorkshire woollen district, of which it was the heart, sent
a third of the conference delegates. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>

<p>Bradford was ideal ground for reformism because it had briefly
enjoyed a new unionist upsurge which had been crippled. The turning
point was the fight at Manningham Mills against wage cuts of up to 33
per cent. It lasted for six months, involved 3,000 workers and
included pitched battles in the town centre. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a>
Eventually the workers were starved back. After this Bradford became,
in the words of Ben Turner, the union organiser, &#8216;the most
heart-breaking district for Trade Union organisation that ever I came
across&#8217;. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> [Leeds, just eight
miles away from Bradford, provides a fascinating contrast: &#8216;the
first authentic ILP councillor in Leeds was not elected until 1906,
when Jowett had already done fourteen magnificent years of service on
the Bradford Council ... But if we note the social and industrial
contrasts, some of the reasons become apparent... The unskilled male
workers were in general successful in improving their conditions is a
result of new unionism, and some of their discontent was dispersed:
the gas strike was short, sharp and victorious where that at
Manningham Mills was long, humiliating and a defeat.&#8217; <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a>]</p>

<p>Against this background the Independent Labour Party was founded
on 14 January 1893. What had happened since 1889 to make such a
reformist party possible? First there were the economic troubles
accompanying foreign competition. Secondly there was mass industrial
struggle given a coherence by socialist leadership. Without these
there could have been no serious break with the politics of Lib-Labism.</p>

<p>If industrial militancy had not been repulsed, a strong political
movement based on confidence and self-activity could have emerged. As
it was, in 1893 there was the correct combination of circumstances
for reformism: workers&#8217; struggles had built up organisation but
defeats had pushed it into bureaucratic channels. On both the
industrial and political fronts leaders had been raised into
prominence by the fight, but now they substituted for the movement of
the mass. The ILP was not the child of new unionism, but of its
defeat. Here in a microcosm was the relationship between reformism
and the working class.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Independent Labour Party</h4>

<p class="fst">The ILP marked a limited breach with the &#8216;great Liberal Party&#8217;.
In Bradford a characteristic debate took place around the party&#8217;s
name. The proposal to call it the &#8216;Socialist Labour Party&#8217; was
lost to the alternative title of &#8216;<i>Independent</i> Labour Party&#8217;
on the grounds that &#8216;they had to appeal to the vast mass of workers
outside, and not only to Socialists.&#8217; <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a></p>

<p>The issue was fundamental. If the aim was to build an active
opposition to capitalism, then what mattered most was not the number
of votes, but the number committed to working for socialism. But near
unanimous backing for the name Independent Labour Party showed the
delegates put electoral success <i>first</i>. As Keir Hardie, the
ILP&#8217;s undisputed leader, put it: &#8216;The number of Labour Members in
the House of Commons. This, to me, is the question of questions.&#8217; <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a></p>

<p>However the title &#8216;Independent&#8217; was insufficient to guarantee
the party&#8217;s future. After all, the Lib-Labs, such as miners&#8217; MP
Charles Fenwick, talked like the ILP about &#8216;the imperative
necessity of returning to Parliament ... workmen who should be able
to speak with authority on all questions affecting the working
classes.&#8217; They too promoted &#8216;a policy of reform, and not of
revolution&#8217;. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> The ILP had to
distinguish itself from Lib-Labism and so adopted as its object: &#8216;the
collective and communal ownership of the means of production,
distribution and exchange.&#8217;</p>

<p>This was not a cynical ploy. It reflected the after-glow of new
unionist struggles. Later attempts to dilute or deviate from what the
ILP rank and file considered the fundamentals of socialism led to
massive fights which in 1932 tore the party apart. In this sense the
ILP was very different from the Labour Party at its formation. It was
formed of individual activists whose ideas had developed through
class struggle, even if they retreated into reformist politics. The
Labour Party itself began without individual membership, through a
process of union affiliation and bureaucratic manipulation.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Myth of the Golden Age</h4>

<p class="fst">The ILP believed the working class could be freed through the
institutions of the capitalist nation state. This has been proved
wrong by the failure of successive Labour governments to challenge
capitalism. But in 1893 there were no practical examples to refute
the reformist argument. The compromises required to get a Labour
government had only just begun and would take forty years to work
through. Only at the end, in 1932, was the ILP made to face up to the
consequences of the position it adopted at Bradford, and the result
was its complete collapse.</p>

<p>It is because the logic of reformism unfolded so gradually that
there arose the myth of Labour&#8217;s golden age, a myth as old as
Labour itself. In later years those who had descended the
parliamentary road, that road upon which workers&#8217; interests are
exchanged for electoral advantage, would look back on the group who
started out from the top of the hill. Inevitably these pioneers
appeared to be more elevated and inspired by lofty ideals. As early
as 1921 a disillusioned Labour supporter could write:</p>

<p class="quoteb">between those early days of ardent faith and heroic
self-sacrifice, those days of Keir Hardie&#8217;s cloth cap in the House
of Commons, and these days of the political machine with its seeking
of votes and place, there is a great gulf fixed. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The gulf was an illusion. Labour&#8217;s politics have never changed
in essentials. The difference between old and new lies in the
external conditions in which this reformism operates. Labour has no
pure workers&#8217; tradition to return to. If we might abuse
Shakespeare: some parties are born rotten, some parties achieve
rottenness, and some have rottenness thrust upon them. There have
been examples of each. <i>The Russian Communists</i> had their
degeneration thrust upon them by the defeat of the German revolution,
the isolation of Russia, its invasion by 16 foreign armies and a
civil war. <i>The German Social Democrats</i> (SPD) achieved
opportunism over a long period and with much effort from people like
Kautsky and Bernstein. But <i>the Labour Party</i>, even at its
origins, has never been anything but reformist.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Dependent Labour Party</h4>

<p class="fst">Despite the drawbacks, the foundation of the ILP had a very
positive side. In 1886 Engels had pointed to the need for a separate
workers&#8217; political organisation, whatever its limitations:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The first great step in a country which enters the
movement for the first time is to constitute the workers as an
independent Labour party, no matter in what way, so long as it is a
distinct Labour party ... as long as it is their own movement &#8211;
[the workers] will be driven forward by their own mistakes, and
acquire wisdom by their failures. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Though wisdom through failure has been a long time coming, Engels
was right to recognise in the formation of the ILP a genuine step
forward for the class.</p>

<p>Yet it is one of the ironies of history that the Independent
Labour Party should have been one of the most <i>dependent</i>
organisations ever created. It was totally reliant on groupings
outside the working class for its theory. This was notwithstanding
the fact that, as Philip Snowden said: &#8216;... the branches were
composed almost exclusively of working people.&#8217; <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>

<p>Theory is a perennial problem for reformists. <i>The tradition of
bourgeois thought, and that of the working class &#8211; which is Marxism
&#8211; are each based on the lives of the two contending classes of
society.</i> Through philosophers, historians, politicians and
economists the capitalists create an intellectual culture to justify
their existence. Marxism draws upon the international history of
working class struggle. But reformists have <i>no independent
tradition</i>. They limit themselves to working through established
institutions, and so pursue an uneasy theoretical path, seeking to
channel working class aspirations <i>in an ideological framework set
by the system</i>.</p>

<p>None of this can gainsay the dedication of the ILP&#8217;s membership.
As Keir Hardie put it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Few of the casual passers-by who halt for a few minutes
to listen to a Socialist speaker standing on an upturned soap box
under a lamp post at the corner of a noisy street are like to carry
away a religious impression ... But get to know the man and his work;
how he leaves home night after night, undergoing fatigue and
inconvenience after a day&#8217;s laborious toil, how he spends Sunday in
visiting some neighbouring town for propaganda purposes, or is hard
at work all day in his own town aiding in the arrangements for the
two Sunday meetings, and how he continues to do this year in and year
out without any hope of fee or reward, and then the truth begins to
dawn upon you that the man is at bottom a religious enthusiast lured
on by his vision of a Kingdom of God up Earth. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Compare this with a later description of the Conservative
temperament from the pen of Lord Hailsham:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Conservatives do not believe that political struggle is
the most im-portant thing in life. In this they differ from ... most
members of the British Labour Party. The simplest among them prefer
fox-hunting &#8211; the wisest, religion. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In life-style the gulf between the working class soap-box orator
and the fox-hunter could hardly be greater. What they share is
religion. The ILP&#8217;s Nonconformist religious fervour was the
clearest proof of its intellectual dependence. Truee, the Chapel
tradition was not, like the Anglican Church, associated with
land-owning interests. But its stress on the idea of employer and
workman worshipping together emphasised a feeling of common interest
and common ideology. To Trotsky this was clear proof that the British
bourgeois had &#8216;laid down from above up its proletariat the heavy
lid of cultural conservatism.&#8217; <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p>The ILP&#8217;s greatest propagandist was Philip Snowden, who earned
his reputation by a recruiting technique known as &#8216;Philip&#8217;s Come
to Jesus&#8217;. To a background of singing, converts were ushered
forward while Snowden declared in ringing tones:</p>

<p class="quoteb">there are signs on every hand of a great and righteous
power at work in the world. The Sun of Righteousness is rising with
healing in its wings. The Christ that is to be appears. A new and
brighter social order will arise. It is the promised New Jerusalem. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The importance of religion in the ILP and the early Labour Party
was immense. Even Tom Mann, who went on to lead the syndicalist
movement of 1911-14 and eventually joined the Communist Party,
thought of joining the priesthood at about the same time as he was
ILP Secretary. A fascinating survey was conducted into the books that
most shaped the ideas of the Labour MPs who sat in the 1906&#8211;1910
parliament. Twenty-five of the forty include religious texts (sixteen
specified the Bible). Only two mentioned Marx or Engels. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a>
[Other authors mentioned included John Ruskin (sixteen replies),
whose critique of capitalism was moulded by a belief in a feudal
golden age. Next came Henry George, popular advocate of land
taxation, whom Engels described as &#8216;a colossal fraud' (eleven
replies). Shakespeare earned five and Robbie Burns and Charles
Dickens, not noted for their political insights, each scored twice as
many as Marx and Engels.]</p>

<p>The ILP consistently talked of smoothing over class conflict,
stressing the common interest of employers and workers. Hardie wrote:
&#8216;it is a degradation of the Socialist movement to drag it down to
the level of a mere struggle for supremacy between two contending
factions. We don&#8217;t want &#8220;class conscious&#8221; Socialists.&#8217; <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a>
Ramsay MacDonald, whom Hardie acknowledged as the ILP&#8217;s &#8216;greatest
intellectual asset&#8217;, added: &#8216;I reject what seems to be the crude
notion of a class war, because class consciousness leads nowhere ...
The watchword of socialism is not class consciousness but community
consciousness&#8217;. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a> Philip Snowden,
who as the party&#8217;s economic expert would be expected to know the
blunt realities of capitalist society, went even further: &#8216;the rich
man ... cannot enjoy his riches in the knowledge of the misery of the
men and women and children around him ... It is to the cultured and
leisured class that Socialism makes, perhaps, its strongest appeal.&#8217; <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a></p>

<p>If class struggle annoyed the ILP it can be imagined what visions
revolution conjured up. In 1895, for example, the <b>Labour Leader</b>
warned that:</p> 

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;The shadow of coming Revolution ... looms dark and
huge over the Continent of Europe. Should an outbreak occur there is
nothing save a narrow strip of sea betwixt us and what would then be
the theatre of a great human tragedy.&#8217; <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Although the ILP was never revolutionary it was progressive in
comparison to the Tories and Liberals. It recognised and indeed owed
its existence to working class organisations such as the new unions,
but rather than leading a confrontation with capitalism, it demanded
that workers be given a place in the national set-up.</p>

<p>The impossibility of formulating an independent reformist theory
has already been touched on. For Hardie ignorance was indeed bliss:
&#8216;the ILP ... has never formulated its theory of Socialism. That is
true, and therein lies its strength&#8217;. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a>
This had devastating effects. It made the ILP incapable of any
analysis of society, or even of its own place in history. Listen to
Hardie&#8217;s description of his party&#8217;s birth: &#8216;How did the ILP
originate? Who shall say? Why do buds begin to unfold in spring? I am
convinced there are spring tides connected with the affairs of man
governed by laws of which we know next to nothing.&#8217; <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a>
The ILP was therefore defenceless against the ideas of capitalism
which surrounded it. As ILP Chairman, Bruce Glasier declared: &#8216;I am
able to speak and work for Socialism without feeling that I belong to
a different cast of beings from that of the ordinary Liberal or
Tory.&#8217; <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a></p>

<p>This was the nub of the matter. The ILP channelled ideas into the
working class that were drawn straight from the well of capitalism,
and in particular from the Liberals and the Fabians. Both Hardie and
Ramsay MacDonald turned to Labour politics only when they were
rejected as Liberal candidates. Even then they repeatedly and
publicly paid homage to Liberalism. In later years Keir Hardie
claimed that his election as MP for South West Ham in 1892 made him
the first socialist MP. It is true his enthusiastic supporters
actually carried him to parliament in a carriage complete with
trumpeter to announce the dawning of a new age, <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a>
hut his manifesto declared: &#8216;I have all my life given an
independent support to the Liberal Party ... <i>I am in agreement
with the present programme of the Liberal Party</i>.&#8217; <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a></p>
<p>Snowden reassured voters that he &#8216;was cradled and nurtured in
Liberalism.&#8217; <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a> Robert Smillie,
miners&#8217; leader and the ILP&#8217;s most important industrial figure,
claimed to be a better Liberal than the Literal candidate himself
when he ran for North East Lanarkshire. <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a>
When MacDonald became Labour Party Secretary, the flirtation with
Liberalism became almost obscene. An important article he and Hardie
wrote 1899 twice declared the ILP linked to Liberalism through &#8216;the
true line of the progressive apostolic succession&#8217;. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a>
They hoped to build &#8216;a golden bridge of palliatives&#8217; between the
two parties. <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>

<p>There were, however, definite limits placed on the ILP&#8217;s
adoption of Liberal politics. An organisation which wanted to be an
alternative to the Liberal Party needed to differentiate itself to
some extent. To do this, the ILP leaned heavily on the Fabians.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&#8216;The worst enemies of social revolution&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">These are the words of Beatrice Webb <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a>,
a key figure in the Fabian Society. This organisation shaped both the
ILP and later the Labour Party. As one historian put it: &#8216;The
Fabians gave modern British socialism its doctrine.&#8217; <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a>
It is surprising that such a tiny organisation could play so large a
role. When it affiliated to the Labour Representation Committee in
1900 it had 861 members, after seventeen years. However the
theoretical incapacity of the ILP gave the Fabians a pivotal role.
Almost from the first two thirds of the ILP&#8217;s ruling National
Administrative Council (NAC), were Fabians, and they included Hardie,
MacDonald, Mann &#8211; who was the ILP&#8217;s secretary &#8211;, Tillett and
Lansbury. <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a> [It is evidence of the
disregard for theory and looseness of organisation that it was quite
possible for activists to retain membership of rival organisations
with conflicting politics. Thus Mann moved quickly from the SDF to
the Fabians. Without leaving the Fabians, he then led the ILP.
Lansbury seems to have held membership of the SDF, Fabians and ILP
all at the same time. Thorne while still in the SDF, became a Labour
MP five years after the SDF had repudiated the Labour Раrty. And so on.]</p>

<p>The Fabians&#8217; leaders &#8211; the Webb &#8216;Partnership&#8217; of Beatrice
and Sidney, along with George Bernard Shaw, the playwright, were not
afraid to admit: &#8216;we personally belong to the ruling class&#8217;. <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a>
For a long time the society had only one working class member, a
house-painter, whom they regarded as an &#8216;exhibit&#8217;. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a>
The Fabian Society was actually more interested in influencing the
upper class by a policy of &#8216;permeating&#8217; the Liberal and Tory
Parties and only turned to Labour as a poor third. In 1891 the
Liberals&#8217; Newcastle conference adopted in entirety a policy which
had been drafted by Sidney Webb &#8211; whom Beatrice described as &#8216;the
chief instigator of policies, the source of Liberal doctrine.&#8217; <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a>
As late as 1910, she confided in her diary that while the Tories had
certain attractions, so too did the Liberals: &#8216;So really I don&#8217;t
know from what party we shall get the most. We may have, in the end,
to establish a real socialist party if we want rapid progress.&#8217; <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a></p>

<p>The Fabians had the utmost contempt for the working class: &#8216;What
can we hope from these myriads of deficient minds and deformed bodies
that swarm our great cities &#8211; what can we hope but brutality,
meanness and crime.&#8217; <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a> A quarter
of a century later, the tone remained unchanged. Beatrice talked of
&#8216;the colossal stupidity of the trade union rank and file&#8217;, &#8216;those
underbred and undertrained workmen&#8217;. <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a>
There was not even a grain of human sympathy. Beatrice Webb
castigated the Liberals&#8217; for providing health insurance for
workers. In 1911 she wrote that it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">is wholly bad, and I cannot see how malingering can be
staved off... What the government shirk is the extension of treatment
and disciplinary supervision &#8211; they want merely some mechanical way
of increasing the money income of the wage-earning class ... No
attempt is made to secure an advance in conduct for the increased
income. <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a></p>

<p class="fst">[It might be surprising that with such attitudes, the Webbs were
able to write their excellent books on <b>The History of Trade
Unionism</b> and <b>Industrial Democracy</b>. But their meticulous
research served a dual purpose &#8211; to train the budding union leaders
in the arts of behaving responsibly, and to show the ruling class
that trade unions were a force to be treated with, rather than to be
repressed or given in to. In Beatrice Webb&#8217;s words, they offered &#8216;a
criticism of the trade unions (for the good of the unionists!) ... an
apology for, or defence of trade unions (for the enlightenment of the
middle class and economists)&#8217;. <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a>]</p>

<p>The Fabian Tract of 1896 entitled <b>The Moral Aspects of
Socialism</b> declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Socialist policy, so far from favouring the weak,
favours the strong ... it is a process of conscious social selection
by which the industrial residuum is naturally sifted and made
manageable for some kind of restorative, disciplinary, or it may be,
&#8216;surgical treatment&#8217; ... In this way it not only favours the
growth of the fittest within the group, but also the fittest group in
the world competition of societies. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Long before Hitler, Bernard Shaw toyed with the breeding of a
master race and a &#8216;superman&#8217;, while advocating &#8216;sterilization
of the failures&#8217;.</p>

<p>Only if we understand their <i>thoroughly ruling-class outlook</i>
can we intelligently approach the Fabians&#8217; outrageous misuse of the
English language when they talked of &#8216;socialism&#8217; or more usually
&#8216;collectivism&#8217;. (The latter had less unpleasant foreign
connotations for these rabid racialists).</p>

<p>Two influences formed the background to Fabian politics. The first
was Joseph Chamberlain&#8217;s &#8216;gospel of ransom&#8217;. Chamberlain gave
the Liberals their national federation and believed that social
services and improved working conditions were a necessary &#8216;ransom&#8217;
to pay to avoid the dangers of social unrest. According to Beatrice:
&#8216;We dare not neglect the sullen discontent now spreading ... if
only for the sake of the rest of the Empire.&#8217; <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, the Fabians were conscious of changes in the capitalist
economy: For much of the nineteenth century ruling-class policy was
known as <i>laissez-faire</i>. The French phrase captured the needs
of the system well. Units of capital were small and foreign
competition minimal. So businessmen demanded free trade and the
unrestricted play of market forces. They wanted the minimum of state
intervention in the process of capital accumulation. But as Germany
and America became commercial threats it seemed to sections of the
ruling class that the state should be more interventionist in its
support of capitalism. One wing saw imperialism as a means of
consolidating markets and sources of raw materials. Another looked to
<i>the state to increase capitalist efficiency at home</i>. The
latter was the policy of the Fabians.</p>

<p>The first complete statement of policy appeared in <b>Fabian
Essays</b> of December 1889. Though issued three months after the
dock strike victory it avoided mentioning trade unions entirely.</p>

<p>Most notable was the idea that state action equals socialism.
Sidney Webb, a former high civil servant, had a positively nauseous
admiration for government bureaucrats: &#8216;in their every act they
worked to bring about the very Socialism they despised.&#8217; <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a>
Therefore &#8216;the Post Office ... is now a purely Socialistic
institution.&#8217; If such was socialism, then, as Shaw proudly boasted,
the Fabian programme had:</p>

<p class="quoteb">not one new item in it. All are applications of
principles already admitted, and extensions of practices already in
full activity. All have on them that stamp of the vestry which is so
congenial to the British mind. None of them compel the use of the
words Socialism or Revolution...or anything...un-English. <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a></p>

<p class="fst">So it was that Sir William Harcourt, Gladstone&#8217;s successor in
the Liberal leadership, declared: &#8216;We are all socialists nowadays.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Fabians set out to be <i>elitist social engineers</i>, working
entirely within the framework of the system <i>to increase efficiency
and avoid the dangers of revolution</i>.</p>

<p>The ultimate aim of Fabian collectivism was capitalist production
organised on a national scale by the state. In the 1930s many were
astounded when the Webbs returned from visiting Stalin&#8217;s Russia, a
state capitalist society, to announce that it &#8216;almost exactly
corresponds to our constitution ... [the] trade union is placed in
exactly the same position of subordination as we suggested&#8217;. <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a>
Commentators should not have been shocked for this had always been
the logic of Fabianism. The working class was to play no active role
in creating the new society. In 1889, in one of the few essays which
deigned to mention workers, the Fabians told them to cease &#8216;fearing
[the state] as an actual enemy, [and] come to look to it as a
Potential saviour.&#8217; <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a> Engels
rightly described the Fabians as &#8216;a clique ... united only by their
fear of the threatening rule of the workers and doing all in their
power to avert this danger.&#8217; <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a></p>

<p>These were the people who &#8216;gave Labour its doctrine&#8217;. The ILP
and later the Labour Party gave such ideas a working-class veneer and
credibility which they would otherwise have lacked. Fabian ideas
turned up, for example, in the work of Robert Blatchford, a key
figure in the founding of the ILP. His newspaper the <b>Clarion</b>
and his book <b>Merrie England</b>, which sold three quarters of a
million copies, popularised Fabian ideas in vulgar form:</p>

<p class="quoteb">nearly all law is more or less Socialistic, for nearly
all law implies the right of the State to control individuals for the
benefit of the nation ... The abolition of toll bars and bridge tolls
was Socialistic action, for it made the roads and bridges common
property. <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The identification of working class interests with the state also
brought with it the idea of nation and nationalism. Blatchford&#8217;s
next masterpiece was entitled <b>Britain for the British</b>, and its
contents may be imagined. His memoirs recall that at the founding of
the ILP: &#8216;we were Britons first and Socialists next.&#8217; <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a></p>

<p>Keir Hardie&#8217;s one attempt at socialist theory, <b>From Serfdom
to Socialism</b>, also verged on the same nonsense:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The policeman and the soldier ... exist by the will and
under the express authority of those same tenants and workmen, who
constitute a prepondering majority in the State, and without whose
consent neither soldier nor policeman could continue to exist.</p>

<p class="fst">Hardie&#8217;s economic theory bore the pernicious stamp of Fabianism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Socialism does not propose to abolish land or capital
[only] capitalism and landlordism. The capital would remain; the
engineers, architects, organisers, and managers who carry on the
businesses would all remain also, and could just as well and as
profitably be employed by society as they now are by the private
capitalist. <a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a></p>

<p class="fst">MacDonald probably put this idea best when he said: &#8216;Capitalism
is now finding fulfilment, and that fulfilment is this new
organisation &#8211; Socialism.&#8217; <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a>
[The Fabians&#8217; attitude to their devotees in the ILP was one of
disapproval. There was, according to Beatrice Webb, &#8216;no chance of
it being more than a wrecking party&#8217; <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a>,
for independent workers&#8217; politics interfered with permeation of the
Liberals and Tories. Furthermore even the mild ILP was too radical
for the Fabians. Thus she welcomed its defeat in the 1895 election
campaign because: &#8216;No class of Englishmen can long tolerate the
simple wrecker.&#8217; <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a>]</p>

<p><i>The ideas that have dominated the Labour Party from the start
have not come from the working class.</i> Lenin was absolutely
correct when he said that from this point of view &#8216;the Labour Party
is a thoroughly bourgeois party&#8217;. [Beatrice Webb described the
difference between the Fabians and ILP as a choice between the
following propositions: &#8216;To bring about the maximum amount of
public control in public administration do we want to organising the
unthinking persons into Socialist societies, or to make the thinking
persons socialistic? We believe in the latter process&#8217;. <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a>]</p>
