<h3>The Labour Party</h3>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h1>6. Revolution or Reform: The Left in the 1920s</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">SO FAR we have not discussed how revolutionary socialists should
relate to Labour in a practical way. This became an immediate issue
when the Communist Party of Great Britain was formed in 1920. <a href="#na" name="fa">[1*]</a>
Unlike Labour, the Communist Party did not see workers as a stage
army serving parliament. Its central focus was the collective
organisation of workers, whether it be the &#8216;Shop Stewards and
Workers&#8217; Committee Movement&#8217;, the &#8216;Minority Movement&#8217; or the
unions generally. But the Communist Party also rejected the
syndicalist disregard of politics. It was assisted in its tasks by
membership of the Comintern &#8211; the Communist International, whose
leaders were Lenin and Trotsky. Lenin intervened in the debates which
preceded the foundation of the British Communist Party; Trotsky
entered the scene in the mid-1920s.</p>

<p>Lenin&#8217;s starting point was the 1917 Russian revolution, the sole
example of working-class power. The Bolsheviks had shown, first, that
there is no gradual parliamentary road to socialism, only revolution;
second, that this requires the active support of the mass of workers,
and, finally, that a mass revolutionary party of the Bolshevik kind
must be present to lead the way to victory.</p>

<p>Translated into British terms this meant that to open the road
towards socialism, three tasks had to be achieved: it had to be
demonstrated that <em>Labour&#8217;s reformism inevitably turns it against
revolution; Labour&#8217;s restraining influence over the majority of
workers must be broken; and workers must be won to a revolutionary alternative</em>.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Home-grown attitudes to Labour</h4>

<p class="fst">Before the foundation of the Communist Party, British
revolutionaries had two attitudes towards Labour. On the one hand
there was the British Socialist Party (BSP), successor to the SDF.
Established in 1912, the BSP merely replaced the SDF&#8217;s sectarianism
with an unprincipled accommodation to the Labour Party. The BSP
believed Labour was &#8216;nothing other than the political expression of
the trade union-organized workers.&#8217; <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>
It followed that revolutionaries must not split away from the true
workers&#8217; party, and Labour could be won to revolutionary socialism.
As one delegate told the Communist Party&#8217;s founding conference:
&#8216;Let us see that we unceasingly carried out our task, until such
time as the Labour Party became a Labour Party with a Communist mind
&#8211; and this could be done [so that] inscribed on the Labour Party
banner were the hammer and sickle.&#8217; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p>An opposite view was put by J.T. Murphy of the syndicalist
Socialist Labour Party (SLP). He countered the BSP by rightly
pointing out that: &#8216;The Labour Party is not the working class
organized politically as a class but the political reflex of the
trade union bureaucracy and the petty bourgeois.&#8217; Unfortunately he
wrongly assumed Labour to be simply &#8216;an instrument of reaction, a
body to be destroyed.&#8217;</p>

<p>Murphy had mistaken the trade union bureaucracy and Labour Party
for tame servants of reaction, denying their reformist role. By so
doing he saw no need to relate to their followers, the ordinary
Labour supporters, arguing the immediate aim was &#8216;to destroy the
Labour Party as an enemy of the proletarian revolution ... by working
for disaffiliation of the unions.&#8217; <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Lenin&#8217;s analysis</h4>

<p class="fst">Lenin rejected both BSP and SLP positions. He denied the one-sided
claims that Labour was either a workers&#8217; political party or purely
reactionary . It was a capitalist workers&#8217; party with all the
contradictions that that involved:</p>

<p class="quoteb">it is a highly original party, or rather, it is not at
all a party in the ordinary sense of the word. It is made up of
members of all trade unions ... It thus includes a vast number of
British workers who follow the lead of the worst bourgeois elements,
the social-traitors, who are even worse than Scheidemann, Noske
[Social Democrats who butchered the German revolution] and similar
people. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Building a Communist alternative required an outright break from
the Labour Party &#8216;as an organisation of the bourgeoisie which
exists to systematically dupe the workers&#8217;. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
But at the same time revolutionaries needed a relationship with the
Labour rank and file. &#8216;If the [advanced] minority is unable to lead
the masses and establish close links with them, then it is not a
party, and is worthless in general.&#8217; &#8216;Cooperation&#8217; had to be
&#8216;carried on systematically&#8217;. Without a connection between
Communists and ordinary Labour supporters, &#8216;between the vanguard of
the working class and the backward workers ... the Communist Party
will be worthless and there can be no question of the dictatorship of
the proletariat at all.&#8217; <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Of course the <em>form</em> of cooperation between vanguard and mass
is subject to change. The Labour Party is not always the central
priority, but to imagine, as Murphy did, that revolutionaries can
relate to workers without having to address their political ideas was
sheer syndicalism.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The affiliation tactic</h4>

<p class="fst">Having established the <em>principle</em> of building a mass
revolutionary party in opposition to Labour, Lenin proposed the
<em>tactic</em> of applying for affiliation to the Labour Party!</p>

<p>Britain was the only place where affiliation to a reformist party
was urged in this way. Elsewhere the strategy was only to break away.
In Britain the route to a mass Marxist party would be more tortuous.
First, <em>there had to be the split</em>. The BSP members who wished
to become Communists were <em>already</em> in the Labour Party, <em>but
had to come out.</em>They would then reapply to affiliate as the
Communist Party, this time on a principled revolutionary basis.</p>
<p>For Lenin the request for affiliation was not the end in itself,
simply a means to the end. It would help the young Communist Party
&#8216;expose opportunist leaders from a higher tribune, that is in
fuller view of the masses.&#8217; <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> But
what if Labour refused the application? &#8216;If the Hendersons and
Snowdens reject a bloc with us ... we shall gain still more, for we
shall at once have shown the masses ... that the Hendersons prefer
<em>their</em> close relations with the capitalist to the unity of all
the workers.&#8217; <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p>Lenin saw affiliation as conditional on certain vital factors.
First: &#8216;the Party of Communists can join the Labour Party only on
condition that it preserves <em>full freedom of criticism and is able
to conduct its own policy</em>. This is of extreme importance.&#8217; <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>
No Continental social democratic party - conceded freedom of
criticism and autonomy, but Lenin believed that the Labour Party&#8217;s
unique alliance between unions and socialist societies would permit
such open revolutionary agitation. In evidence he cited the BSP&#8217;s
newspaper <strong>The Call</strong>, which openly attacked Labour leaders with
impunity. <a href="#nb" name="fb">[2*]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, the tactic was conceived in the context of the immediate
prospect of European revolution. The Comintern thought the battle of
revolution versus reform would soon be over. Affiliation was
therefore a short-term policy for winning workers to the Communist
Party, not a long-term one for becoming an integral part of Labour.</p>

<p>Finally, Lenin&#8217;s proposal depended on a clearly demarcated
Communist Party, able to contrast its politics to those of Labour
before the masses. This made Communist Party affiliation very
different from that of the BSP. When the BSP had applied to join the
Labour Party it made no mention of politics at all, pleading only
that its seven prospective parliamentary candidates be permitted to
run under Labour colours. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a> Unlike
the BSP, Lenin had no intention that the Communist Party should
capture the Labour Party, nor that it should dilute its own
revolutionary Marxism in order to stay inside. As Duncan Hallas puts
it, the Communist Party would go into the Labour Party &#8216;with flags
flying and drums beating ... to conduct a vigorous and open offensive
against the social traitors, ie. against the whole leadership and
political tradition of the Labour Party.&#8217; <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> <a href="#nc" name="fc">[3*]</a></p>

<p>Tactics have changed with circumstances. Since the anti-Communist
witch-hunt of the late 1920s, affiliation on a revolutionary basis
has ceased to be credible. Yet Lenin&#8217;s method retains a permanent
validity. Razor-sharp it cut right across the BSP&#8217;s adaptation to
reformism, as it did the SLP&#8217;s ultra-left dismissal of the Labour
rank and file.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Voting Labour</h4>

<p class="fst">The ultra-left in the SLP and elsewhere thought that voting Labour
would compromise their purity and implicate their organisations in
Labour&#8217;s betrayals. They believed opposition to reformism was
expressed by abstaining or running candidates whose primary purpose
was to attack the Labour Party.</p>

<p>Lenin dismissed such ideas, stressing once more the need to win
mass support for Communism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">If we are the party of a revolutionary <em>class</em> and
not merely a revolutionary group ... we must, first, help Henderson
or Snowden to beat Lloyd George and Churchill; second, we must help
the majority of the working class to be convinced by their own
experience that we are right, i.e. that the Hendersons and Snowdens
are absolutely good for nothing ... that their bankruptcy is
inevitable; third, we must bring nearer the moment when, <em>on the
basis</em> of the disappointment of most of the workers in the
Hendersons, it will be possible, with serious chances of success, to
overthrow the Government of the Hendersons at once. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Though coloured by the rosy prospects of 1920, this approach had
very practical advantages over the right-wing BSP (&#8216;Vote Labour
with illusions&#8217;) and ultra-left SLP (&#8216;Don&#8217;t vote Labour&#8217;). It
meant reaching out to a wide audience without abandoning
revolutionary politics. As Lenin wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">British Communists very often find it hard even to
approach the masses, and even to get a hearing from them. If I come
out as a Communist and call upon them to vote for Henderson and
against Lloyd George, they will certainly give me a hearing. And I
shall be able to explain ... why the Soviets are better than
Parliament. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Communist Party could do more, he said. At election times the
party leaflet should call for a &#8216;vote for the Labour Party in order
to prove that the Hendersons, Thomases, MacDonalds and Snowdens,
could not solve the manifold problems confronting society through the
Parliamentary machine.&#8217; <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p>Lenin did not call for &#8216;Labour to power on a socialist
programme&#8217; since no socialist programme is possible for a reformist
parliamentary party. His position can be summed up as: &#8216;Vote Labour
without illusions&#8217;; although Lenin had a more colourful
description: &#8216;I want to support Henderson in the same way as a rope
supports a hanged man.&#8217; <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The early Communist Party</h4>

<p class="fst">At its founding convention the Communist Party accepted
affiliation by 110 votes to 85. A letter was sent to Labour HQ
incorporating just three points: &#8216;a) The Communists in conference
assembled declare for the Soviet (or Workers&#8217; Council) system; b)
The Communist Party repudiates the reformist view that a Social
Revolution can be achieved by the ordinary methods of Parliamentary
Democracy.&#8217; Then came the request for affiliation. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a>
This was very much in the spirit of Lenin&#8217;s arguments, with Tommy
Jackson finding an even more blood-curdling metaphor than Lenin&#8217;s
hanged man: &#8216;Let us take the Labour leaders by the hand as a
preliminary to taking them by the throat.&#8217;</p>

<p>Not surprisingly the 1921 Labour Conference turned down
affiliation by 4,115,000 to 224,000, and there were similar votes in
1922, 1923 and 1924. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a> Did this mean
the affiliation tactic had failed?</p>

<p>Far from it. Success did not rest on any conference vote. Despite
the toughness of the Communist Party&#8217;s approach there is ample
evidence that <em>it raised its revolutionary political profile</em>
while <em>at the same time relating to local Labour Party members.</em></p>

<p>One example was the Caerphilly by-election in August 1921. Though
this was a mining constituency where Labour was sure to win, anger
against right-wing Labour movement leaders was still bubbling after
Black Friday. The Communist Party decided to use its candidacy to
build its organisation and register a left-wing protest. An
indication that this was not a sectarian mistake came when the entire
Labour Party branch at Bedlinog resigned to campaign for the
Communist. He won a respectable protest vote amounting to 20 per cent
of the successful Labour candidate&#8217;s total. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>

<p>There had been fears expressed that standing for parliament would
play into the hands of reformists. But because the Caerphilly
campaign was clearly related to workers&#8217; direct struggle, it
successfully used the political interest aroused by elections to get
the <em>revolutionary</em> argument across.</p>

<p>The question of whether Communists should stand for election where
Labour was running (thereby splitting the workers&#8217; vote and risking
the victory of the openly capitalist candidate) was also addressed.
Revolutionaries (unlike reformists) do not make a fetish out of
parliament. The decision to stand depends on <em>whether or not this
will assist workers&#8217; self-activity and build the revolutionary
party.</em> A campaign which produced a derisory vote could only
demoralise the left. One that lined up in sectarian fashion with the
openly capitalist Tory or Liberal parties <em>against</em> Labour would
be equally damaging. Caerphilly avoided both dangers.</p>

<p>Although the Labour leadership was incensed by Communist tactics,
many of the rank and file saw it differently. In the 1922 general
election six Communist candidates enjoyed local Labour Party support
and two were successful, Walton Newbold (Motherwell) and Saklatvala
(Battersea North).</p>

<p>Winning two seats in parliament &#8211; a minor concern for
revolutionaries &#8211; was merely the most visible sign of the Communist
Party&#8217;s ability to relate to the advanced sections of the Labour
Party without abandoning its opposition to Labourism. Further
evidence was provided by the impressive list of local Labour Party
branches and unions which repeatedly backed affiliation. In 1923, for
example, these included seventeen engineering branches, sixteen
miners&#8217; lodges and four NUR branches as well as the furniture and
shop workers&#8217; unions at national level.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The inevitable pressures</h4>

<p class="fst">Like any genuine intervention of revolutionaries in a hostile
environment, the Communist Party&#8217;s strategy lacked the security of
sectarian isolation, exposing Communist Party members to the risk of
being influenced by Labour&#8217;s reformist milieu even as they sought
to win its rank and file. An article in <strong>The Communist</strong> of 1922
showed the dangers: &#8216;The Communist Party wants to be able to
advocate the working-class programme ... and it cannot do this
effectively outside the all-embracing working-class organisation &#8211;
the Labour Party.&#8217; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>The writer had fallen into every trap. To say revolutionaries
could not be effective outside Labour was to forget that Lenin
considered rejection of affiliation to be a valuable lesson which
would assist Communism. And how could Labour be &#8216;the all-embracing
working-class organisation&#8217; if it excluded the only people who
could point the way to a socialist society?</p>

<p>A pull towards reformism was the price the Communist Party had to
pay for intervention, but it was worthwhile <em>as long as the
leadership understood the need to combat such tendencies towards
political degeneration</em>. However, when Lenin died and Stalinism
took over the Comintern, the correct orientation on Labour was
obscured. The turning point came at the end of 1923 when the
Communist Party decided to secretly send its members into the Labour
Party in ones and twos so as not to attract attention. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a>
This negated the affiliation tactic as a public exposure of Labour&#8217;s reformism.</p>

<p>The results could be seen during the first Labour government.
Palme Dutt, editor of the Communist Party&#8217;s newspaper, forgot that
Communists wanted Labour in office to demonstrate its bankruptcy, not
to apologise for it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We are not fighting against the Labour Government, which
it is our concern to uphold and sustain ... we cannot [say] that
every folly and weakness of a Labour Government plays into our hands.
It is not so. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Palme Dutt implied that Labour in government was somehow &#8216;a
lesser evil&#8217;. He was mistaken. The Tories, as the open party of
capitalism, are relatively straightforward in their defence of the
system. In that sense they have <em>already exposed</em> their true
political tendencies. But although Labour <em>believes</em> it can
steer a middle course between classes, once in office it is called
upon to use the state to break strikes and so on. In <em>practice</em>
it was not a lesser evil. <a href="#nd" name="fd">[4*]</a></p>

<p>The example of the Mensheviks in Russia illustrates this. Until
the middle of 1917 they were a reformist party, to the right of the
Bolsheviks, but far more radical than the British Labour Party ever
was and apparently miles away from the official parties of the
Tsarist state. This changed after October. They then lined up with
the most reactionary White generals and the forces of international
capitalism attempting to crush the first workers&#8217; state.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Left Wing Movement</h4>

<p class="fst">Disappointment with the first Labour government created openings
for Communist Party. Disgust With MacDonald was rife. Beatrice Webb
wrote: &#8216;The party is certainly in a bad state of mind ... Poor
MacDonald, what a mess he has made of it. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p>The Communists&#8217; response was to build a &#8216;Left Wing Movement&#8217;.
The LWM&#8217;s newspaper, the <strong>Sunday Worker</strong>, reached a
circulation over 100,000 copies, clear proof that disgruntled Labour
activists were looking for answers. But the LWM was actually an
obstacle to revolutionary politics. Why was this so?</p>

<p>The LWM described itself as consisting of:</p>

<p class="quoteb">sympathetic Labour Parties and left Wing Groups who are
pledged to work within the Labour Party for a left Wing programme. It
is not part of the objects of the Left Wing to create splits within
the Labour Party, nor is it under the domination of any political
party. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Its chief efforts were directed at getting detailed resolutions
through Labour Party Conference. The resolution on foreign policy,
for example, included opposition to the league of Nations,
abandonment of imperialism, diplomatic relations with the USSR and
support for the Chinese Nationalists. Then came industrial policy: a
minimum wage, a 44-hour week, workers&#8217; control, nationalisation of
all basic industries without compensation and the formation of a
Workers&#8217; Defence Corps. This was followed by policy documents on
&#8216;Land and Agriculture&#8217;, &#8216;Unemployment&#8217;, Rational and Local
Finance&#8217;, &#8216;Health and Housing&#8217;, &#8216;Local Government&#8217; and so on.</p>

<p>The Left Wing Movement was not, as the Communist Party claimed, an
application of the Comintern &#8216;united front&#8217; tactic. Correctly
applied, this involved an attempt &#8216;to force the leaderships of the
reformist and centrist organisations into limited co-operation on
concrete issues <em>by winning their followers for unity in action</em>.&#8217;
<a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a> The LWM was neither limited,
concrete, nor tied to action. Its vast range of policies, couched in
the form of worthy resolutions rather than designed for action, made
it a sort of pseudo-revolutionary party in its own right.</p>

<p>Not only did it substitute for the Communist Party, it involved
Communists sustaining a reformist left within the Labour Party.
Labour lefts were too contradictory in their attitudes to organise
coherently for themselves. As the 1925 Communist Party Congress
heard: &#8216;We have found the left-wing&#8217; elements without the
Communist Party entirely lacking in initiative ... until our members
step in ... the others do not move.&#8217; <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a>
The Communist Party gained nothing because there was now a
left-sounding home inside the Labour Party for those who, had they
had to choose between MacDonald and revolutionary socialism, might
have opted for the latter</p>

<p>There are occasions when, as a means of exposing the leaders,
revolutionaries put demands on reformist organisations which they
expect will be rejected. But this is not always effective as an
exposure. It all depends on whether the demand helps <em>mobilise</em>
the reformist rank and file, or <em>demobilises</em> it. To be useful,
it must be related to the consciousness of the rank and file.</p>
<p>The demand for affiliation in 1920 was a good example. Labour
claimed to be a &#8216;broad church&#8217; and during the period of the
Council of Action, was spouting its most-left wing rhetoric ever. In
such a context the Communist Party&#8217;s request for affiliation seemed
valid to Labour supporters. Whether or not Henderson acceded to it,
valuable propaganda opportunities opened up.</p>

<p>But the Left Wing Movement&#8217;s approach did the reverse. To call,
after the MacDonald ministry, for Labour to be returned to power on a
semi-revolutionary programme did not excuse the leadership before its
supporters. The distance between the first Labour government and the
Left Wing Movement&#8217;s demand was so great that these demands seemed
an impossible fantasy. Even worse, Communist Party sympathisers
inside the Labour Party <em>fell into believing LWM demands could be
carried out</em>.</p>

<p>The emphasis on conference motions played into the hands of Labour
leaders adept at the game of resolution-mongering as a substitute for
real action. Did anyone, apart from the Left Wing, seriously imagine
MacDonald and his cronies would take any notice of motions demanding
&#8216;the overthrow of the capitalist class and the establishment of
international socialism.&#8217; <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p>The Left Wing campaign did not help workers discover the Labour
Party was bankrupt. On the contrary. It suggested to the best
elements that it was not. As a Communist Party pamphlet declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the workers in the Labour Party must rally to the &#8216;Reds&#8217;
... and fight for a new programme and a new leadership within the
Labour Party, which is the sole guarantee of success in the heavy
struggles that are inevitable in the near future. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The theoretical flaw: Labour equals the trade unions</h4>

<p class="fst">The theories that underpinned the LWM were expounded by Palme Dutt
and J.T. Murphy.</p>

<p>The key argument was put by Palme Dutt:&#8217;Between the mass of the
Trade Unions and the mass of the Labour Party there can be no
divergence, because the Trade Unions are the Labour Party.&#8217; <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a>
This was the BSP&#8217;s position all over again, but with a difference.
Palme Dutt admitted the reactionary nature of the Labour leadership.
He thought that as the mass struggle moved trade unionists leftwards
they would drive out the union bureaucracy and, after a delay,
convert Labour to revolutionary politics:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It is natural that the class struggle, revealing itself
first in its primitive economic forms without relation to political
consciousness, should meet with heavy opposition and obstruction ...
but must eventually win its way forward, within the ranks of the
Labour Party.&#8217; <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The mistakes here are numerous. Firstly, the British trade union
bureaucracy will never lead revolutionary struggle and will not be
removed this side of a socialist revolution. Experience has shown
that rank and file movements <em>independent of the trade union
machine</em> are needed to free the rising class movement from
bureaucratic control. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> If this is
true of the union bureaucracy, it is even less likely that the Labour
Party leadership can be made responsive to a revolutionary working
class. <a href="#ne" name="fe">[5*]</a></p>

<p>It is also wrong to suggest that because revolutionaries must be
in the unions it follows that they should stay in the Labour Party.
Despite formal links, the two are in fact quite different
institutions. As we have written elsewhere:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Despite the ... affiliated trade union membership, the
party had no direct relationship with the point of production. The
[union] bureaucracy signed the cheques and cast the block votes at
conference, not the rank and file. Further, the ordinary union
member&#8217;s connection with the party was either totally passive or at
best consisted in canvassing ... Thus despite the overlap of
membership and leaders, the unions and Labour Party were functionally
separate and subject to very different influences.</p>

<p class="quote">The workplace and the polling booth confront people in
different ways, the one as members of the working class in a
collective unit, the other as individual citizens of the national
state. For these reasons revolutionaries cannot have the same
approach to trade unions and the Labour Party. One is the mass
organisation <em>of</em> the working class, the other claimed to be a
mass organisation <em>acting on behalf</em> of the working class. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Furthermore, parties and unions are organised on different lines.
A party is a <em>voluntary grouping</em> united on the basis of <em>shared
political ideas</em>. Trade unions follow the contours of capitalist
industry and are not so concerned with the political beliefs of those
who join.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s trade union links made it an exception to the rule. But
despite the affiliated trade unions, when Communist Party members
said: &#8216;We are going to a Labour Party meeting&#8217;, they were not
referring to their union branches but to the local ward. Apart from
Communist Party entrists, this was composed of people whose only
motive for meeting was that they shared reformist beliefs.</p>
<p>The content of union meetings necessarily differed from Labour
ones, and revolutionaries had to relate differently to each. At the
former the agenda concerned collective organisation and industrial or
economic resistance. Through their workplaces revolutionaries had a
common class bond with the membership and so had the right to
intervene and offer a lead in collective struggle or perhaps raise
wider Marxist positions. It was <em>a springboard for arguing
revolutionary politics</em>.</p>

<p>What cemented the Labour Party branch together, however, was
<em>general reformist politics &#8211; </em>how parliament or the local
council should be used. This gave no common starting point for
revolutionaries. Of course, given the absolute freedom that Lenin had
demanded when he suggested affiliation, revolutionaries could have
attended ward meetings to explain why parliament offered no solutions
and that socialism could only come about through smashing the state,
not through its reform. But the repeated rejection of affiliation and
the beginnings of a witch-hunt meant this was not possible.</p>

<p>In other words both theoretically and practically, while the
Labour Party was <em>connected with the unions</em>(through the
bureaucracy)<em>it was not the same as the unions.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>From reformist mistakes to ultra-leftism</h4>

<p class="fst">The flaw in the Communist Party&#8217;s analysis had damaging
consequences. It led Murphy to imagine that the Labour leadership
would inevitably fall to the left. In the summer of 1925 he wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The working class is only at the beginnings of its
revolutionary experience and education. The labour Party will grow in
numbers and strength as the working class in increasing numbers
awaken to political consciousness. In the process ... the bourgeois
politics which dominate it to-day [will be] cleansed from its ranks. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Apart from the non-Marxist and mechanical idea of the ineluctable
march of history by which the mass of Labour supporters are
&#8216;inevitably destined to be driven&#8217; <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a>,
Murphy was wrong to see workers&#8217; struggles transforming Labour in
their own image. We have seen that the great advances in working
class struggle &#8211; 1910&#8211;14, the shop stewards&#8217; movement and 1919
&#8211; did not lead advanced workers towards Labour, but <em>away from
it</em>. Labour&#8217;s influence over the vanguard grew only when the development of working-class
consciousness was blocked by defeat.</p>

<p>Even without such evidence Murphy would have been mistaken. Labour
was distanced from workers and not subject to their control.
Revolutionary parties may sometimes be out of step with the mass
movement and have to be forced back into line &#8211; the obvious example
being the Bolsheviks at certain stages in the 1917 revolution. But
while they can make wrong turnings, these are easily rectified
because the aim of the party (its rank and file and its leaders
alike) is to develop the workers&#8217; struggle to its highest point. In
the revolutionary party there is no <em>bureaucracy</em> with a vested
interest in the preservation of existing society.</p>

<p>Not so with the Labour Party. The leadership always sees the wider
movement as <em>subordinate</em> to parliament and the state. Labour
<em>responds</em> to mass pressure (as with the adoption of Clause
Four), but it does so only in order to release excess steam and
prevent an explosion.</p>

<p>Moreover, to believe that right-wing politics would be
automatically cleansed from the ranks was to forget that the only way
to unmask fake leftism is by creating <em>an alternative leadership</em>
free to initiate real action. It is through the test of practice that
reformism is dissipated.</p>

<p>The Communist Party&#8217;s theory led to further errors. If Labour
mirrored workers&#8217; consciousness, then what did MacDonald and
Henderson represent? According to Murphy they were partly middle
class &#8216;invaders and partly an historical remnant of Liberalism&#8217;.
<a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> Palme Dutt concurred. Writing at
the end of 1924 he described the right-wing leaders as alien usurpers
of power. Their days were numbered:</p>

<p class="quoteb">When, therefore, the ex-trade union parliamentary
adventurers and honest middle-class muddleheads in the wake of Mr
MacDonald endeavour to fasten a non-working-class formula, such as
parliamentary democracy, on the Labour Party, they are only showing
their own narrowness and complete unconsciousness of the character of
the working-class movement ... the working class struggle will press
forward beyond them. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Such optimism evaporated with the anti-Communist Party witch-hunt.
It was the revolutionary left, not the right, whose days were
numbered in the Labour Party. Now the argument changed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Either the [right-wing] will destroy the Labour Party and
turn it into a Liberal Party and an enemy of the workers, like the
German Social Democratic Party, or the Labour Party must destroy
them. Either the Labour Party will become a new version of the
Liberal Party and share its fate, or else the labour Party must
become an open class party. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The bald phrase &#8211; &#8216;either Liberalism or Socialism&#8217; &#8211;
ignored the permanent contradiction of a capitalist workers&#8217; party.</p>

<p>By 1928 the witch-hunt was in full swing and the Comintern was
entering its &#8216;third period&#8217; insanity. Now the formula &#8216;Labour
equals the unions&#8217; had completed its journey from reformism to
ultra-leftism. If Labour was no longer the workers&#8217; political party
then it must be an open capitalist party. The 10th Communist Party
Congress announced: &#8216;the Labour Party in 1928 has come out
unmistakeably as the third capitalist party.&#8217; <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a>
The majority of workers missed this &#8216;unmistakeable&#8217; event.</p>

<p>The grotesque sectarian policies which Lenin fought against in
1920 were now wheeled out as fresh ideas. Some Communists wanted
union disaffiliation from Labour. Others wanted to tell workers, to
stop paying the political levy &#8211; at the very time when the Tories
were attempting the same thing through the use of the law. The
totally unscientific notion of &#8216;social fascism&#8217; was hurled at
Labour and all its works. The theory of social fascism, peddled by
Stalin at the end of the 1920s, suggested that all the parties &#8211;
from social democracy to the Nazis &#8211; were simply different facets
of a common reactionary politics, and that Communists should treat
them with equal contempt. This entirely overlooked the nature of
reformist parties such as Labour and the need to relate to their mass
of working-class followers.</p>

<p>The early Communist Party had wrestled courageously against
immense difficulties in Britain, the home of reformism. Their
failings derived from a faulty analysis and later the baneful
influence of Stalinism. It is not a matter of apportioning blame;
hindsight confers an advantage which we have no right to squander.
The mistakes must not be repeated.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Trotsky&#8217;s contribution</h4>

<p class="fst">Trotsky&#8217;s major contributions to our understanding of the Labour
Party are in <strong>Lessons of October</strong> (1924) and <strong>Where is Britain
Going?</strong> (1925). He wrote them against Stalin and the Comintern
leaders who believed Britain did not require a distinct mass
Communist Party.</p>

<p>In 1929 Trotsky discussed the debate in retrospect, quoting his
own work as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Without the party, independently of the party,
skipping over the party, through a substitute for the party, the
proletarian revolution can never triumph ... We have paid too dearly
for this conclusion as to the role and significance of the party for
the proletarian revolution to renounce it so lightly or even to have
it weakened.&#8217; (<strong>Lessons of October</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="quoteb">The same problem is posed on a wider scale in my book
<strong>Where is Britain Going?</strong> This book, from beginning to end, is
devoted to proving the idea that the British revolution, too, cannot
avoid the portals of communism and that with a correct, courageous
and intransigent policy which steers clear of any illusions with
regard to detours, the British Communist Party can ... be equal in
the course of a few years to the tasks before it. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky&#8217;s analysis of the Labour leadership elaborated Lenin&#8217;s
main themes and was blistering in its attack:</p>

<p class="quoteb">These pomps authorities, pedants and haughty,
high-falutin&#8217; cowards are systematically poisoning the labour
movement, clouding the consciousness of the proletariat and
paralysing its will. It is only thanks to them that Toryism,
Liberalism, the Church, the monarchy, the aristocracy and the
bourgeoisie continue to survive ... The Fabians, the ILPers and the
conservative trade union bureaucrats today represent the most
counter-revolutionary force in Great Britain, and possibly in the
present stage of development, in the whole world ... Workers must at
all costs be shown these ... liveried footmen of the bourgeoisie in
their true colours. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p class="fst">However he did not take an ultra-left line and ignore the link
between Labour and the unions. In fact he went beyond Lenin, to
locate the specific role of the trade union bureaucracy on the
political wing of reformism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the Labour Party ... is only a political transposition of
the trade union bureaucracy ... these are not two principles, they
are only a technical division of labour. Together they are the
fundamental support of the domination of the British bourgeoisie. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p class="fst"><strong>Where is Britain Going?</strong> was an excellent work which critics
derided for its suggestion that Britain was on the eve of gigantic
class struggles. Trotsky was vindicated dramatically by the General
Strike and miners&#8217; lockout just a year afterwards. While the basic
propositions in the book were clear and absolutely correct, one
important prediction was wrong:</p>

<p class="quoteb">A certain analogy would appear to arise between the fate
of the Communist and Independent [ILP] parties. Both the former and
the latter existed as propaganda societies rather than parties of the
working class. Then at a profound turning-point in Britain&#8217;s
historical development the Independent party headed the proletariat.
After a short interval the Communist Party will, we submit, undergo
the same upsurge. [Therefore] the Communist Party will occupy the
place in the Labour Party that is at present occupied by the
Independents. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In no sense did Trotsky suggest that the Communist Party and ILP
shared common politics. The latter was &#8216;in a class sense not worth
a rotten egg&#8217; while the Communist Party&#8217;s destiny was to &#8216;prepare
itself for the leading role.&#8217; <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a>
The witch-hunt, which took off just after Trotsky wrote the book,
soon put paid to any idea that revolutionaries could lead <em>from
inside the party</em>.</p>

<p>Yet a nagging question remains. Could the mechanism which brought
ILP leaders like MacDonald to lead the party be a model for others?
To answer this we must pick up the threads of the ILP&#8217;s story which
we left in 1918.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The ILP pays the price of reformist &#8216;success&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">For an organisation which by the mid-1920s had reached just 30,000
members, the ILP seemed to have been blessed with astounding good
fortune. In 1906 there were 18 ILP members among the 30 Labour MPs,
rising to 121 out of 191 during the first Labour government.
(Moreover there were six ILP members in the cabinet, three of them
from the ILP&#8217;s ruling National Administrative Council). <a href="#nf" name="ff">[6*]</a>
The 1924 election raised the proportion to 114 out of 150.</p>

<p>The astute Wertheimer was not deceived. He noticed that although
the ILP&#8217;s &#8216;political influence seemed to reach peak-point&#8217;, its
&#8216;membership was always subservient to Labour Party allegiance
whenever the two came into conflict ... The responsibilities of
statesmanship proved stronger than the party politics.&#8217; <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p>That remorseless degeneration which had started the day the ILP
spurned the title &#8216;socialist&#8217; in order to win a parliamentary
foothold had become a gangrene whose spread kept pace with the number
of MPs. The putrefaction erupted to the surface during the first
Labour government:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the ILP appeared at the very pinnacle of its power, when
its members were in a Cabinet and Government whose leader they had
helped to select ... The failure to win even the active sympathy of a
Front Bench which, in principle, was dominated by the ILP suggests a
lack of commitment in ILP allegiance which was remarkable. Throughout
the period it is <em>almost impossible to detect what MacDonald would
have called &#8216;the ILP spirit&#8217; in anything the Labour Government
achieved.</em> <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Leaders who had used ILP membership as a ladder to success now
kicked it away. MacDonald told the ILP to: &#8216;mind its own business
and regard Socialism, not as a creed of a lot of blethering
easie-oozie asses who are prepared to pass any resolution without
knowing its meaning.&#8217; <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a> Snowden
proposed the ILP&#8217;s disbandment, MacDonald its castration. (They
resigned from the ILP in 1927 and 1930 respectively). Clifford
Allen&#8217;s rather pathetic defence of the ILP&#8217;s existence was that
&#8216;there was a necessity for a Left Wing organisation in the larger
Party; otherwise there would be a tendency of certain elements to
drift towards the Communist Party.&#8217; <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a> <a href="#ng" name="fg">[7*]</a></p>

<p>Thirty years of hard work, the achievement of parliamentary
influence beyond their wildest imaginings, had brought the rank and
file ILP members exactly nothing. There are two common explanations
for left-wing failure. Reformists and centrists blame <em>individual
weakness of character</em> &#8211; the next leader must &#8216;try harder&#8217;.
To the ultra-left, failure proves that <em>all intervention must be
shunned</em>. The real reason was that the ILP attempted the
impossible &#8211; to satisfy workers&#8217; aspirations through capitalist institutions.</p>

<p>ILP socialists were like industrial militants who suppose that by
winning top union posts they gain control. In the end they invariably
wake to find that one remote bureaucrat is simply replaced by another.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Clydesiders</h4>

<p class="fst">The &#8216;Clyde Brigade&#8217; valiantly tried to break this impasse. In
1925 and 1926, they drove MacDonald&#8217;s supporters from the ILP
leadership. The change was symbolised by Jimmy Maxton replacing
Clifford Allen as party chairman.</p>

<p>The Clydesiders did not contribute a new politics, but a
certain <em>style</em>. They attempted by sheer will-power to bridge
the widening gap between working-class aspirations and the MPs in
parliament, a gap that was imposed by the Parliamentary game. The
famous procession to St Enoch&#8217;s Station in Glasgow on 19 November
1922 captured the mood. Kirkwood wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We were going to do big things. The people believed that.
We believed that. At our onslaught, the grinding poverty which
existed in the midst of plenty was to be wiped out. We were going to
scare away the grim spectre of unemployment which stands grinning
behind the chair of every artizan. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In parliament they resolved by personal example <a href="#nh" name="fh">[8*]</a>
to galvanise the sagging ranks of Labour Party and frighten the
government benches. Johnny Muir, ex-revolutionary, leader of the
Clyde stewards began the attack: &#8216;Muir asked for no palliatives ...
the system was wrong and the system must go. When he sat down, Sir
John Simon stepped across, wrung him by the hand, and cordially
congratulated him on a brilliant maiden effort.&#8217; <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a>
The experience must have broken Muir, for he became a lame MacDonald
supporter. Something stronger was needed. They decided to <em>create
scenes</em>, sometimes on the floor of the Commons and occasionally outside.</p>

<p>The first occasion was 27 June 1923. Despite an 11 per cent rise
in tuberculosis deaths among children, the Tory spokesman, Walter
Elliott was cutting health expenditure. Maxton rose to describe how
his own wife died nursing their sick child back to life. He
castigated Elliott&#8217;s party policy: &#8216;I call it murder. I call the
men who initiated the policy murderers.&#8217; <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a>
Uproar followed and Maxton was suspended. Wheatley jumped to his feet
and repeated the accusation, followed by Campbell Stephen and
Buchanan. They were all thrown out. Later Maxton was removed for
uttering such dreadful words as &#8216;blackguard&#8217;, &#8216;liar&#8217; and
&#8216;damned unfair&#8217;! The House of Commons has presided over the
forcible subjugation of a third of the planet and its policies have,
whether deliberately or not, shortened the lives of millions. But so
to accuse a Right Honourable Member is unforgivable!</p>

<p>The Clyde comrades&#8217; outburst was totally sincere and fully
justified. Their personal incorruptibility was absolute. But the
value of their strategy must be evaluated. Although appearing
rebellious, it operated within strict limits. <em>The Parliamentary
outburst was designed to shake up the House of Commons, not to smash it.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&#8216;Socialism in our time&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">The Clydesiders&#8217; weakness has been common to &#8216;official&#8217;
Labour lefts. Like the right they combine class and nation, though
the left gives extra emphasis to class. This sharing of a common
ideological ground between left and right was evident in the ILP&#8217;s
acceptance of &#8216;Hobsonism&#8217; &#8211; a theory which inspired the ILP
under the MacDonald supporter Clifford Allen <em>and</em> under Maxton.</p>

<p>J.A. Hobson was a Liberal economist who sought an alternative to
socialism. He wrote: &#8216;Talk about &#8220;the abolition of the wage
system&#8221; is commonly as vague as it is heroic. What isfeasible is
the gradual enforcement of the principle of a living wage, embodied
in&#8217; a minimum standard of comfort for a class.&#8217; <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a>
Later he added the notion that capitalist crises were due to
underconsumption. Workers could not buy back everything they produced
and over-production was the result. By stimulating demand through a
minimum wage or providing family allowances, the boom/slump cycle
could be abolished.</p>

<p>There was nothing socialist about Hobsonism. Keynes, a Liberal,
adopted similar ideas while Henry Ford, viciously anti-union and
champion of an aggressive modem capitalism, argued the same thing:
&#8216;an underpaid man is a customer&#8217; reduced in purchasing power. He
cannot buy ... The cure for business depression is through purchasing
power.&#8217; <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a></p>

<p>Hobson&#8217;s idea that the interests of workers and bosses could be
made compatible through the planning of demand was ideal for all
sorts of reformists. The right-wing TUC leaders after the General
Strike took it to justify collaboration between employers and unions.
Hobsonism served Oswald Mosley as a Labour minister in the 1920s and
as a fascist in the early 1930s.</p>

<p>In the mid-1920s Hobson and other &#8216;exerts&#8217; joined ILP
Commissions to develop a range of new policies. The result was &#8216;The
Living Wage&#8217; or &#8216;Socialism in Our Time&#8217;. Proponents like H.N.
Brailsford made it clear that &#8216;the New Socialist Policy&#8217; was
quite feasible &#8216;<em>even with privately-owned industries</em>&#8217;.
<a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a> Like Fabianism, this was ruling
class ideology masquerading insocialist clothing. An attempt to plan
capitalism rationally and stimulate demand appeared to benefit
workers, but did so <em>only to the degree that their enemy, the
capitalist system, was strengthened even more</em>.</p>

<p>Yet when the clydesiders took over the ILP leadership they
swallowed the bait-hook, line and sinker. Of course they gave it a
left-wing colouring. A living wage and family allowances would help
workers, and the bosses&#8217; refusal to pay up could have been an
excuse to expropriate them with or without compensation, as the ILP
argued. Yet all this only seemed plausible if the entire structure of
capitalism and the state were overlooked. Vagueness suited Maxton&#8217;s
temperament, but Wheatley, the intellectual power-house of the group,
felt a duty to think the policy through and draw conclusions. The
result was terrifying nonsense.</p>

<p>The state must organise capitalism within the national framework:
&#8216;Socialists recognised that if Britain is to be saved from
submersion ... our aim [must be] to link up our essential industries
as departments of one great national British industry working in
cooperation with other parts of the Empire.&#8217; <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a>
And why not use the British Empire? Until the first Labour government
only rabid right-wingers slobbered over the Empire. Now the left
discovered it was part of a state whose power they wished to increase
and they competed with each other in extolling its virtues. Thomas
Johnston, editor of the ILP&#8217;s paper, <strong>Forward</strong>, modestly
described the empire as &#8216;the greatest lever of human emancipation
the world has ever known&#8217;. <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a>
Maxton wanted &#8216;a great Empire that shall house and develop a free
people ... Our only objection is that it is too limited&#8217;. <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a></p>

<p>Rebutting Communist Party criticisms, Wheatley wrote: &#8216;It may be
very nice to list a series of idealistic abstractions, but these cut
no ice ... Whatever we think of [Empire], our duty as members of the
Labour Movement is to see how we can utilise it to serve our
purposes.&#8217; <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a> International
solidarity was replaced by fear of foreign imports. He wrote: &#8216;I
would use the navy, were I in power, to sink the ship that brought
from abroad the product of sweated labour to reduce the standard of
life here.&#8217; <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a> The end of this
reformist odyssey was racism: &#8216;It was necessary to end that state
of affairs where &#8220;the Coolies are busy, the Britishers are at the
Buroo [the dole office]&#8221;.&#8217; <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a></p>

<p>Wheatley represented the most extreme of the &#8216;official&#8217; Labour
left. He simply pressed the extraordinary contradictions of
capitalist/worker ideology to their limit when trying to think his
way through to socialism.</p>

<p>Needless to say MacDonald was going to have nothing to do with
&#8216;flashy futilities&#8217; like &#8216;Socialism in Our Time&#8217;. &#8216;These
tactics will never be pursued ... and that&#8217;s that&#8217;. <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a>
The wordy Reports, the carefully thought-out pamphlets, the
Commissions &#8211; all crumbled into dust.</p>

<p>In 1928, with the labour movement in precipitate decline after the
General Strike and MacDonald riding high, Maxton took a desperate
step, going over the head of the ILP National Administrative Council
to issue <em>Our Case for a Socialist Revival</em> with A.J. Cook of
the miners. This manifesto was the prelude to a national campaign. It
was Maxton&#8217;s grandest gesture, also his most disastrous. Not only
did the independent action of its chairman threaten to rip the ILP
apart, but the packed launch meeting in Glasgow flopped. For Willie
Gallacher it was &#8216;The saddest meeting I ever saw&#8217;, <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a>
while on the platform John Wheatley, &#8216;with a face eloquent of
disgust, drew from his waistcoat pocket the substantial cheque he&#8217;d
written for the campaign funds and carefully tore it into little
pieces.&#8217; <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a></p>

<p>The deflating effect of the meeting was due to the manifesto&#8217;s
lack of realism. It called for rapid and substantial change, but the
campaign was clearly directed at gingering up the existing Labour
Party rather than providing any alternative:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It was on the one hand far too soft and centrist to have
a long-term survival, and on the other hand it was far too little to
have an immediate impact. One can make use of a little axe that is
sharp, or a massive axe that is blunt. But what can one do with a
little axe that is blunt? <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Poplarism</h4>

<p class="fst">Poplarism was the one glimmer of light in the gloom of the left
inside the Labour Party during the 1920s. It showed the difference
between <em>the struggle for reforms</em> and <em>reformism</em>.</p>

<p>Poplarism was dominated by George Lansbury. He was active in
London&#8217;s East End from the turn of the century, and as early as
1905 Poplar was &#8216;notorious&#8217; for unemployment schemes. Soon
Lansbury and his associates gained an influence on the council and on
the boards of guardians that administered unemployment relief.</p>

<p>Mass post-war activity had an impact on this part of London. In
1919 this combined with the grassroots involvement of Poplar leaders
in the unions to help give Labour its first majority in the Borough
Council elections. <a href="#ni" name="fi">[9*]</a> The councillors&#8217;
aim was summed up by Lansbury: &#8216;The workers must be given tangible
proof that Labour administration means something different from
Capitalist administration, and in a nutshell this means diverting
wealth from wealthy ratepayers to the poor.&#8217; <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a>
To this end the councillors raised unemployment allowances as well as
council employees&#8217; wages. Casual employment in the docks meant
Poplar was already a deprived area, and so that the cost of raising
allowances and wages did not fall on the workers locally, the
councillors demanded &#8216;equalisation&#8217; of rates across London. Rich
boroughs would have to assist their poorer brethren. To force this
policy on Lloyd George&#8217;s unwilling government, the councillors
withheld their contribution to police, asylum and county council funds.</p>

<p>In September 1921 thirty councillors were jailed for their action.
They were freed after a six-week campaign which revealed what was
unique about Poplarism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the day after their release, 2,000 enthusiastic
supporters crowded into Bow Baths to cheer their councillors, while
an overflow meeting of another 2,000 had to be held outside in Roman
Road. That weekend there was a &#8216;monster demonstration&#8217; in
Victoria Park to welcome them home. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This mass support had been built by consistent work. Noreen
Branson&#8217;s excellent history shows how the original proposal to
break the law was thrashed out at a conference of local trade union
branch representatives. There followed a series of &#8216;well-filled
public meetings&#8217;. The final Council meeting before the arrests saw
the town hall besieged by supporters &#8216;packing the alleyways and
[standing] on the window sills. Outside [were] some 6,000 people who
could not get in.&#8217;</p>

<p>Ten thousand people followed the women councillors to their jail.
A rent and rate strike was prepared by a many-thousand-strong
Tenants&#8217; Defence League. Two other left-wing councils decided to
follow Poplar into illegality and action spread: &#8216;marches by the
unemployed demanding &#8220;work or maintenance&#8221;, deputations to boards
of guardians and clashes with the police were reported from many
areas.&#8217; The TUC Conference gave support.</p>

<p>Herbert Morrison, who led London&#8217;s Labour Party, did his best to
isolate and destroy Poplarism, but even he was forced to plead with
the prime minister to do something:</p>

<p class="quoteb">a sheer lack of faith in the whole of the institutions of
State ... is growing among those bands of hungry desperate men ...
Sir. I say there is a distinct tendency in that direction which is
dangerous to National Government and to Local Government. <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the end the government had to give way, freeing the councillors
and equalising London&#8217;s rates. The tangible result was a fall in
Poplar&#8217;s death rate. In 1918 it had stood at 22.7 per 1,000 people;
in 1923 this had halved to 11.3. Over the same period infant
mortality fell from 106 to 60, which despite Poplar&#8217;s social
deprivation was the lowest rate for the 95 largest towns in Britain.
<a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a></p>

<p>The councillors&#8217; determination to withstand prison until
victorious, marked these events as exceptional in Labour&#8217;s history.
Local government could be more than just a platform. There is a
potential contradiction between the <em>national</em> state, whose
prime function lies inthe deployment of &#8216;armed bodies of men&#8217; to
defend the ruling class, and <em>local government</em>which has a
service function. The Comintern had recognised this when it passed a
resolution which, though clearly designed for different
circumstances, had a bearing on Poplar:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Should the Communists receive a majority in the local
government, institutions, it is their duty to take the following
measures:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li class="quote">form a revolutionary opposition to fight the
bourgeois central authority;<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li class="quote">aid the poorer sections of the population in every
possible way (economic measures, the organization or attempted
organization of armed workers&#8217; militias etc.);<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li class="quote">expose, at every opportunity, the obstacles which
the bourgeois state power places in the way of fundamental social
change;<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li class="quote">launch a determined campaign to spread
revolutionary propaganda, even if it leads to conflict with the
state power;<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li class="quote">under certain circumstances, replace the local
government bodies with Soviets of workers&#8217; deputies. <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a></li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">Poplarism was very different from the long tradition of &#8216;gas and
water socialism&#8217; practised by many Labour Parties under Fabian
guidance. This had envisaged the creation of &#8216;municipalised&#8217;
industries &#8211; public transport and so on, as a step towards
&#8216;nationalisation&#8217;. The emancipation of the working class or local
government as a base to attack central government played no part. The
key concern was efficiency in the provision of services.</p>
<p>Poplar&#8217;s councillors did not substitute themselves for action,
they <em>led</em> it. Between 1919 and 1923 the masses were not used as
a means to win council seats and then protect them. The councillors
saw their role as serving the workers&#8217; movement. They had,
unfortunately, an Achilles heel.</p>

<p>Until 1924 the <em>activities</em> of the Poplar Labour Party were
not hindered by the general <em>reformist beliefs</em> they undoubtedly
held. But the first Labour government presented Poplar with a
dilemma. This should have been the opportunity Poplar needed to
consolidate its gains and extend its methods nationally through
legislation. Naturally the councillors expected John Wheatley&#8217;s
assistance &#8211; for not only was he the most left-wing member of the
cabinet but as minister of health, responsible for local government.
Alas, Wheatley did no more than cancel a surcharge which his Tory
predecessor had imposed but never dared enforce.<em>That was all.</em>He
assured his cabinet colleagues:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I have expressed no opinion whatever in regard ... to
Poplar ... I explicitly decline to do so and carefully avoided any
indication of either sympathy or the reverse ... The motion tabled by
the Liberal Party suggested that the rescission of the Poplar order
is calculated to encourage illegality and extravagance. My answer is
that you are much more likely to encourage illegality by keeping
alive a statutory order which you cannot enforce ... The Government
means to carry out the law as they find it ... and has no intention
whatever of encouraging or allowing lax administration. <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a> <a href="#nj" name="fj">[10*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Poplar activists had to admit that Wheatley had done nothing
positively to assist them: &#8216;Mr Wheatley&#8217;s action did not give
fresh powers to Guardians or ... afford new opportunities for the
exploitation of public funds by the Socialists. Guardians all over
the country are still liable to surcharge.&#8217; <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a>
As a final humiliation it was stated: &#8216;The Poplar Board ... know
that in Mr Wheatley they have a Health Minister who ... will
understand and sympathise with them in the horrible problem of
poverty.&#8217; <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a></p>

<p>The Labour government prepared the downfall of Poplarism. In April
1925, during the very week Labour won <em>every</em> seat on the Poplar
Board of Guardians, Poplarism collapsed. Its £4 minimum wage policy
caved in to a ruling in the House of Lords and the council agreed to
introduce pay cuts.</p>

<p>What happened in Poplar in 1925 was a sorry contrast to 1921. When
the courts had been used previously the local mass movement had been
involved in direct defiance and widersections were drawn in. But in
1925 Lansbury put his hopes in parliamentary action. He addressed
MacDonald and Thomas, avowed enemies of Poplarism, begging them for
help, to no avail. The municipal workers eventually decided to strike
to defend their wages. As the local press reported, all departments
came out, but &#8216;at 3&nbsp;p.m. George Lansbury accompanied by
Councillors and Trade Union officials arrived and as a result the
strike was called off some three hours later.&#8217; <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a>
In Lansbury&#8217;s <strong>Labour Weekly</strong> we read that after hearing their
MP: &#8216;They realized that a strike in Poplar would be a strike
against themselves, and only their own flesh and blood would suffer.&#8217;
Presumably their flesh and blood were unaffected by wage cuts.</p>
<p>The parliamentary graveyard had claimed its latest victim.
<em>Reformism</em> had killed the <em>struggle for reforms.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The balance sheet</h4>

<p class="fst">If we try to draw up a balance sheet for Labour&#8217;s official left
at the end of the 1920s the result is depressing. Apart from the
local episode of Poplarism, which the Labour government ended, there
had been a lot of &#8216;sound and fury signifying nothing&#8217;.</p>

<p>First there were the Clydesiders and their ILP. In 1919 Clydeside
workers had indeed struck terror in the hearts of the upper class
during the forty-hours&#8217; strike and put the king in &#8216;a funk about
the labour situation&#8217;. <a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a> But
Wheatley and the other MPs elected in 1922 were but the palest
reflection of that earlier militancy. Wertheimer noticed that scenes
in the Commons had little effect:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Both Conservatives and Liberals refused to recognise
these foibles as expressions of the class war and regarded them as
nothing more than a rather sympathetic eccentricity. In the same way
James Maxton enjoys a popularity on the &#8216;other side of the House&#8217;
and in the capitalist dailies that stands in striking contrast to his
fanatical extremism. <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A recent history concludes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It all made for colourful Press Coverage. Red Clydeside
had left the streets and sat in Parliament. But the Press of 1919 had
registered genuine panic at the Bolsheviks of George Square; the
Press from 1922 offered no more than condescending indulgence to
Maxton and Kirkwood. From the beginning the Scottish rebels were
treated as colourful curiosities and not as threats to public order.
<a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Clydesiders were just part of the picture. Could not a united
left wing have done better? There had in fact been a left wing formed
in 1925, which included all the prominent figures, partly to counter
the challenge from the Communist Party. As well as the Clydesiders,
there were important people such as Marion Phillips, Susan Lawrence,
George Lansbury and John Scurr. The last two were heroes of
Poplarism. The evolution of this left wing was described by John
Scanlon, a Clydeside socialist writing just after the collapse of the
1929&#8211;31 Labour government:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Dr. Phillips is one of the staunchest defenders of the
Labour Government&#8217;s Anomalies Bill [to disqualify certain
unemployed claimants]. Miss Susan Lawrence ... was the first person
to &#8216;tick off&#8217; Mr. Wheatley when he dared to criticise the
Government. Mr. George Lansbury ... framed the rules which finally
expelled Mr. Maxton ... Mr. John Scurr ... was the first judge
appointed to try Mr. Maxton each time Mr. Maxton tried to carry out ...
the programme approved by Mr. Scurr in 1925. That was the rebel group
of 1925.</p>

<p class="fst">Scanlon then added the epitaph which should be inscribed on the
tombstones of successive generations of Labour left-wingers: &#8216;Was
it not that nature sometimes tempers a keenness of politics with a
sense of humour, suicide would be the only alternative of the
disillusioned Socialists.&#8217; <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A contrast: The revolutionary struggle for reforms</h4>

<p class="fst">Our criticism of the Labour Party is not solely that Labour can
never bring socialism, but that for most of the time <em>it is an
obstacle to the struggle for reforms.</em>The Labour Party sets out to
work <em>within</em> an enemy institution, the capitalist state. This
is a hostile environment. But the path it chooses is not the only one
available: there is another way of fighting within enemy institutions
which contrasts strongly with the British experience. This was
demonstrated by the Bolsheviks in Russia before the revolution of 1917.</p>

<p>Under Tsarism the Bolsheviks had only the most limited
opportunities for legal activity, yet made expert use of them.
Elections themselves became occasions for mass action. When, in 1912,
the authorities disqualified some of the electorate a strike movement
immediately began which involved 70,000 people, forcing the
government to back down and organise new elections. <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a></p>

<p>The Clydesiders treated the Glasgow electorate as a stage army
whose task was completed once their MPs boarded the train at St
Enoch&#8217;s Station. Parliamentary scenes were supposed to be the <em>real
</em>force for change. The Bolshevik deputies saw scenes in the
Russian parliament, the Duma, as a catalyst for struggle outside.
When a deputy was prosecuted for sedition, the entire Social
Democratic group (Mensheviks and Bolsheviks) protested and were
suspended; 72,000 workers in St Petersburg and 25,000 in Moscow came
out on strike. A reactionary newspaper gave the deputies the
following magnificent compliment:</p>

<p class="quoteb">very close connections have been established between the
deputies and the workers ... every speech in the Duma arouses a
response among 200,000 workers. All live questions in working-class
circles are immediately re-echoed from the Duma rostrum, whence the
Social-Democrats censure the government and still farther excite the
ignorant masses.</p>

<p class="quote">At the same time all utterances of the Social-Democratic
deputies are taken up by the workers. The objectionable obstruction
in the Duma organised by the Social-Democrats as a protest against
their arrogance being curbed, entailed a mass strike. <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Tsarist Duma, packed by reactionaries elected through a rigged
voting system and deprived of any power by an autocratic state,
became a powerful weapon, not to change Russia, to be sure, but to
raise the combativity of the working class.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s official left in the 1920s made virtually no impact
within parliament or the party. Its belief that Labour was <em>the
</em>instrument to achieve socialism also precluded it from serious
work outside. The far tinier forces of the Communist Party, which
lacked decades of history and hundreds of MPs, were not bound by the
same limitations. Through its agitation inthe collective
organisations of the class it made a real contribution to the crucial
event of the 1920s, the General Strike.</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#fa" name="na">1*.</a> The SDF had never posed the
important questions for revolutionary socialists confronting the
Labour Party because it always had a sectarian concept of Marxism.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fb" name="nb">2*.</a> But the organisation was
undergoing a transformation wrought by the 1918constitution. The
closer the Labour Party came to actually holding office, the more a
centralised political party with its own distinct and exclusive
ideology grew up to impose discipline.</p>

<p class="note">As long as Communists understood affiliation as just a tactic it
did not lead to a compromising of their politics. But if membership
of the Labour Party became an end in itself, then pressure to conform
would threaten revolutionary principles.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fc" name="nc">3*.</a> Tactics appropriate to parties may
not be suitable for minuscule groups. Lenin&#8217;s stress on the
&#8216;masses&#8217; and the &#8216;class&#8217; showed that he was thinking in terms
of party: not group, strategy.</p>

<p class="note">There have been occasions when the extreme weakness of the
revolutionary left has necessitated different tactics. Thus
Trotskyists in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as the Socialist Review
Group (the precursor of the Socialist Workers Party) used &#8216;entrism&#8217;
inside the Labour Party. This did not involve a public declaration of
revolutionary intent, or insistence on official recognition of the
right to free criticism and organisational autonomy. Such entrism had
to be recognised as a tactic imposed by great weakness. As soon as it
had seized the purpose of helping revolutionaries to stand on their
own feet, entrism had to be abandoned. As a long-term policy it could
only lead to absorption by the reformist milieu or the abandonment of
genuine class struggle (which has always been outside the confines of
the Labour Party organisation). <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fd" name="nd">4*.</a> But although it <em>acted</em> as a
capitalist party it was <em>not</em> &#8216;a third capitalist party&#8217; (as
the Communist Party in its ultra-left phase after 1928 called it).
For Labour still retained links with the trade unions and was
considered to be <em>the workers&#8217; political party</em> in the minds
of millions. A capitalist workers&#8217; party is the only correct description.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fe" name="ne">5*.</a> The <em>soviet</em> type of
organisation is the only one which can solve the problem of workers&#8217;
democratic control of power. It is able to do so because its
delegates are elected from workplaces and therefore subject to
permanent collective control. The parliamentary constituency offers
no such basis.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#ff" name="nf">6*.</a> In comparison, the massive trade
unions battalions, which controlled conference and financed 101 MPs,
were rewarded with only seven cabinet members.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fg" name="ng">7*.</a> Maxton was not averse to using the
Communist bogey as a justification for ILP style reformism, as his
parliamentary speech on <em>How to Avoid a Communist Crash</em> shows:
&#8216;We on these benches ... think that the crash ... may be avoided if
all sections of this House rise to a sense of that ideal and are able
to say not merely that they have sympathy, but that they can produce
each year tangible evidence ... We want to join with every
well-disposed person in the House who is prepared to avoid this
crash. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fh" name="nh">8*.</a> John Wheatley, the intellectual
leader of the group, impressed many contemporaries. Mosley (at that
time a left-wing Labour MP) described him as the only man of Lenin
quality the English Left has ever produced&#8217;. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a>
Wheatley believed that setting an example of simple living and moral
rectitude could prevent degeneration. Thus he moved a motion at the
1923 ILP Conference to ban MPs from attending social dinners. It was
passed by 93 votes to 90 (although dinners with the king were
excluded from the resolution since he was above politics and
therefore no political risk). <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fi" name="ni">9*.</a> Of the 30 councillors who later
went to jail, nearly half were or had been <em>lay</em> officials in
their unions.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fj" name="nj">10*.</a> Naturally Wheatley&#8217;s explicit
refusal to express sympathy evaporated as soon as he was in
opposition and he was no longer in a position to do anything. Opening
a block of flats in the area in 1925 he said that &#8216;The Poplar
Borough Council in many respects was a great pioneer in the work of
social emancipation, and it was only as the policy of Poplar
permeated the country that they would march towards a different order
of society&#8217;. <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a></p>
