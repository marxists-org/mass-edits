<h3>The Labour Party</h3>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h1>10. The Labour Party during<br/>
the Second World War</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">IT IS A commonly held myth that the Second World War was a
&#8216;People&#8217;s War&#8217; against fascism, which rose above class
interests. Like the First World War, however, it was an imperialist
conflict. Although fascism was just one particular form of
capitalism, this did not mean that socialists could afford to be
indifferent to its threats to bourgeois democracy. That would have
been dangerously ultra-left. <a href="#na" name="fa">[1*]</a></p>

<p >Many of the freedoms which bourgeois democracy allows are the fruits of past workers&#8217;
struggle. Such things as the right to organise in trade unions, hold
demonstrations or publish and sell newspapers, weigh little when set
against the economic enslavement of the working class, but they can
be invaluable weapons in building the mass movement towards the point
where capitalism can be overthrown.</p>

<p>However the Second World War was not a struggle of bourgeois
democracy versus fascism. The ruthless suppression of movements for
colonial liberation by the rulers of France and Britain, the policy
of non-intervention which had allowed unrestricted fascist supplies
to Franco, and the cold-blooded carving up of Europe after the war,
all pointed in the same direction.</p>

<p>This war was indeed an imperialist one. The threat to the workers&#8217;
movement and to the human race represented by modern capitalist
militarism &#8211; of which fascism was but one guise &#8211; would in no way
be ended by the victory of the Allies. Then, as now, the only real
solution was successful workers&#8217; revolution. It was the task of
socialists to build towards this revolution and <em>against</em> their
capitalist rulers.</p>

<p>Needless to say, such considerations never entered the minds of
the labour bureaucrats. In May 1940 the Labour Party joined a
coalition government led by Winston Churchill. The party executive
agreed to this with only one dissenting voice. The Labour Party
Conference endorsed it by 2,413,000 votes to 170,000. Opposition came
only from pacifists, a few Trotskyists and some fellow-travellers of
the Communist Party, which at that time declared the war to be an
imperialist war. In the Commons only two ILP MPs, Jimmy Maxton and
Campbell Stephen, opposed a vote of confidence in the new government.</p>

<p>There was a clear division of tasks in the coalition. When it
concerned fighting for the interests of capitalism abroad, the choice
was Churchill, the Tory leader. But when it came to containing the
class struggle at home, Labour had the advantage. That was why Ernest
Bevin was made minister of labour and Herbert Morrison, home
secretary. (Of course Labour was not entrusted with control of the
purse-strings. A Tory, Kingsley Wood, was chancellor of the exchequer.)</p>

<p>The value of this arrangement was soon obvious. One of Bevin&#8217;s
first acts as minister was the passing of the Emergency Powers Act of
May 1940, endowing his office with virtually dictatorial powers to
conscript labour. Attlee explained:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Minister of Labour will be given power to direct any
person to perform any services required of him ... The Minister will
be able to prescribe the terms of remuneration, the hours of labour,
the conditions of service. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Had the Tories attempted this alone the resistance might have been
extensive. Instead only a handful of Labour MPs raised any queries.
One was David Kirkwood who probably remembered his jail experience in
the last &#8216;war to end all wars&#8217; of 1914&#8211;18: &#8216;Am I in a
position to say that if Labour is conscripted, so will wealth be
conscripted?&#8217; The Bill passed unanimously without any amendments.</p>

<p>On 4 June 1940, a joint consultative committee composed equally of
employers and TUC representatives agreed that for the duration of the
war strikes and lockouts would be banned and arbitration would be
binding in their place. This agreement was embodied in Bevin&#8217;s
Order 1305 which regulated industrial relations until 1945.</p>

<p>Order 1305 did not aim to arrest recalcitrant workers, since this
was impossible on a mass scale. The effect of declaring a strike
illegal was largely to strengthen the power of union officials over
the members. Nevertheless, during the war 2,200 breaches of Order
1305 were reported leading to the prosecution of 6,281 people, of
whom 5,100 were convicted. (Proceedings were taken against groups of
workers 109 times, against employers just twice.) <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p>With the rising wave of strikes at the end of 1943 and beginning
of 1944, Bevin wanted a much harsher measure than Order 1305. His
speech of 4 April 1944 startled his audience when he said that the
whole conciliation machinery was in danger of being wrecked by
striking miners:</p>

<p class="quoteb">What has happened this week in Yorkshire is worse than if
Hitler had bombed Sheffield and cut our communications. It is the
most tragic thing that in Britain you can do more harm by thoughtless
action and lack of discipline than your enemy can do to you. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Bevin received full support from the TUC General Council in
driving the miners back to work. It was as a result of this crisis
that Regulation 1AA emerged to strengthen the authorities against
&#8216;anyone who attempted to foment or exploit a strike in an essential
service. The penalty for incitement was raised to a maximum of five
years&#8217; penal servitude or a fine of &#163;500 or both.&#8217; <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Despite the support of the General Council, there was resistance
to Regulation 1AA at the TUC Congress itself. Reference back of the
General Council statement was only defeated by 3,686,000 to
2,802,000. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> The law would in fact have
been powerless against a united workforce, but the new Regulation was
used mainly as a psychological threat. It was never used in practice
before its withdrawal in May 1945.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The government shows its true colours</h4>

<p class="fst">Another area in which the government showed its real nature was
that of the repeal, or at least amendment, of that notorious act of
revenge for the General Strike &#8211; the Trades Disputes Act. From
early 1940 the TUC pleaded in vain for its repeal. Eventually
Churchill wrote stating that this was impossible during the war.</p>

<p class="quoteb">I am convinced that to propose to Parliament repeal or
even modification of this Act would start a controversial discussion
which might well develop into difficulties which will hamper our war
effort. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A TUC delegation discovered &#8216;that the decision which had been
come to was a decision of the whole Cabinet &#8211; which rather startled
us.&#8217; <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> The 1943 Labour Conference
added its voice for repeal. But when it appeared that Attlee, Bevin
and Morrison were willing to enforce the punitive provisions of the
Act against the civil servants the campaign folded. Other issues that
aroused anger were the detested means test and miserly pensions. <a href="#nb" name="fb">[2*]</a></p>

<p>The reactionary character of the government showed itself not only
in home policy, but in foreign policy.</p>

<p>Let us start with Britain&#8217;s attitude to India. With the entry of
Japan into the war on 7 December 1941, the question of winning the
support of Indian political parties for the British war against the
advancing Japanese became very important. For a long time Churchill
made it clear that he was against the independence of India. In 1941
he declared that the Atlantic Charter, with its promise of
self-determination of peoples, applied primarily to Europe. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>
On 22 March 1942, Cripps was sent to India to pacify Indian Congress
Party leaders who refused to support the war unless India was granted independence.</p>

<p class="quoteb">It was transparently a mere manoeuvre, prompted by the
new danger to the subcontinent from the Japanese. Cripps offered the
Cabinet&#8217;s promise of full independence after the war. Mahatma
Gandhi, with justice, refused to accept what he called a &#8216;post-dated
cheque&#8217;. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In August 1942 the Indian Congress Party began civil disobedience
to force the British to quit India. Gandhi, Nehru and other Congress
leaders were arrested, with Cripps&#8217; approval. Attlee chaired the
cabinet meeting which approved the detention of these leaders. When
this was revealed in the Commons, Aneurin Bevan shouted, &#8216;Then they
ought to be ashamed of themselves. They do not represent us.&#8217; <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a>
British repression led to nearly 1,000 people being killed by
November 1942. This was followed by a famine in Bengal that cost the
lives of as many as one and a half million. On 20 November Churchill
restated his aim to preserve the empire. &#8216;I have not become the
King&#8217;s First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of
the British Empire.&#8217; <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>Another example of reactionary foreign policy was the affair of
Admiral Darlan who, after Petain and Laval, was the most notorious
collaborator with the Nazis in the French Vichy government, formed
under German occupation. On 8 November 1942 US and British troops
landed in Morocco and Algeria and prepared to move towards Tunisia.
There was opposition from the Vichy French, but suddenly, when it was
clear that the Allies were winning in North Africa, Admiral Darlan,
who was visiting the area, turned round and joined the Allies. He was
welcomed with open arms, as though there was nothing to forgive.</p>

<p class="quoteb">As the allies moved forward to victory, such cases would
often arise, and with them renewed suspicion that Churchill wanted,
not a New Order in Europe, based on the Resistance movements, but a
return to the Old Order presided over by monarchs, industrialists and
military men, whether or not they had collaborated. Even on the
right, many were sickened by the respect now shown for a man who had
associated so closely with Petain and Laval. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Nye Bevan led the protest, writing:</p>

<p class="quoteb">What kind of Europe have we in mind? One built by rats
for rats? It may appear to some people a very clever idea to seduce
and beguile these men who owe their power to hurt us to their having
been the jackals of our enemies; but it does not bear that appearance
to the millions of oppressed men and women in Europe to whom we look
for help in our offensive against Germany. Are they to be expected to
face torture, imprisonment and death so that the authors of their
calamities may be feted by us? <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A new chapter of infamy started with the entry of US and British
troops into Italy. On 25 July 1943, a coup overthrew the Italian
fascist dictator Mussolini. He was replaced by the former Italian
Commander in Chief in Ethiopia, Marshal Badoglio, who soon turned
towards the Allies. The coup against Mussolini took place against the
background of a huge strike wave, which swept Milan, Turin and other
parts of Northern Italy.</p>

<p>Bevan won a parliamentary debate against government resistance and
managed to touch a raw nerve, coming close to exposing the
imperialist character of the war. Bevan began by reciting, amidst
ever angrier interruptions, the speech which Churchill had delivered
on a visit to Rome in 1927:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I could not help being charmed, like so many other people
have been, by Signor Mussolini&#8217;s gentle and simple bearing and by
his calm, detached pose, in spite of so many burdens and dangers ...
Anyone could see that he thought of nothing but the lasting good, as
he understood it, of the Italian people, and that no lesser interest
was of the slightest consequence to him.</p>

<p class="quote">If I had been an Italian, I am sure that I should have
been wholeheartedly with you from start to finish in your triumphant
struggle against the bestial appetites and passions of Leninism ...</p>

<p class="fst">Bevan went on:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Let us make no mistake about this ... There are many
Members in the House who have no complaint against Fascism, except
when it is strong enough to threaten them ... There was no complaint
either against Italy or against all her sins and vices. The whole
Fascist setup was supported by a majority of this House ... <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Another disgusting chapter in British foreign policy occurred
when, in October 1944, the Germans withdrew from Greece. Churchill
sent the British army to fill the vacuum and prevent a takeover by
the Communist-dominated resistance movement, EAM. Churchill went to
Moscow to clear the issue with Stalin. They discussed the division of
spheres of influence among the Allies. Churchill jotted down on a
half sheet of paper his ideas for the relative degree of control by
the Great Powers in the Balkans as follows:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">Rumania: Russia 90%, others 10%.<br/>
Greece: Great Britain (in accord with USA) 90%,Russia 10%.<br/>
Yugoslavia: 50&#8211;50.<br/>
Hungary: 50&#8211;50.<br/>
Bulgaria: Russia 75%, others 25%.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">Stalin took his blue pencil and made a large tick upon it. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a>
Churchill&#8217;s instruction to the British army was to &#8216;treat Athens
like a conquered city&#8217; and within a month it was fighting the EAM,
which had carried the main burden of the struggle against the Nazis
in Greece. Stalin, as good as his word, stood by while 60,000 British
troops turned on the Communists. In the House of Commons a motion of
censure was moved by Seymour Cox of the Tribune group but was lost by
279 to 30, with the official Parliamentary Labour Party abstaining. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p>At the Labour Party Conference the following week, many agreed
with the left&#8217;s outrage at the Greek events. But the leadership had
put its prestige on the line over this issue. Wielding the union
block vote given &#8216;out of loyalty rather than conviction&#8217; the
party executive won by 2,455,000 votes to 137,000 <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p>As a gauge of the constituency delegates&#8217; mood, one could point
to the result of the elections for constituency party members on the
executive. Harold Laski, a strong critic of the party leaders but not
an MP, came top; Emmanuel Shinwell, a strong critic inside the House
of Commons, came second; and most significant of all, Nye Bevan,
standing for the first time, secured the fifth place out of seven.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Labour left&#8217;s illusions in the coalition government</h4>

<p class="fst">When the coalition government was formed the Tories had an
overwhelming majority in parliament and took the lion&#8217;s share of
cabinet posts. In view of this it seems amazing that the left of the
Labour Party should imagine the government would implement numerous
progressive measures. How could anyone believe that prime minister
Winston Churchill with a 30-year record as ruling-class bloodhound,
was the modern saviour? He had been responsible for the repression of
miners at Tonypandy before the First World War, organiser of
intervention against Bolshevik Russia, and most vicious opponent of
the 1926 General Strike.</p>

<p>No Tory politician had illusions that the Churchill government
would introduce measures of a socialist nature, but Nye Bevan, Laski
and Co were full of this idea; the logic of the war, the need for
victory, would lead Churchill to see the light. Utopian irrationalism
took the place of a rational explanation of class interests and
motivation. George Orwell noted in his diary on 20 June 1940:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I don&#8217;t think he [Churchill] would jib at any step
(e.g., equalisation of incomes, independence for India) which he
thought necessary for winning the war.</p>

<p class="quote">Well, if only we could hold for a few months, in a year&#8217;s
time we shall see red militia billeted in the Ritz, and it would not
particularly surprise me to see Churchill or Lloyd George at the head
of them. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst">On 1 June 1940 Laski declared the democratic revolution had begun:
&#8216;We cannot actually achieve socialism during the war, but we can
institute a whole series of Government controls which after the war
may be used for Socialist ends.&#8217; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>John Strachey, his biographer tells us, regarded criticism of
Churchill as &#8216;scarcely conceivable&#8217; <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a>,
and Bevan said: &#8216;I yield to no one in my personal admiration of the
Prime Minister&#8217;s qualities.&#8217; <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p>The most extreme case of adoration was the book Guilty Men by
Cato, published in 1940. Cato was the pseudonym for several authors,
including Frank Owen and Michael Foot. <a href="#nc" name="fc">[3*]</a>
To bring into relief the strength of Churchill, the book exposes the
pacifism of Ramsay MacDonald. MacDonald neglected the equipment of
the armed forces. &#8216;He had been a pacifist in 1914&#8211;19 and
therefore felt no anxieties about the strength of the Air Force.&#8217;
<a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a> MacDonald and Baldwin</p>

<p class="quoteb">found us at the end of a great war, wounded indeed and
weary, but victorious, confident of solving our manifold problems and
capable of doing so. MacDonald and Baldwin took over a great empire,
supreme in arms and secure in liberty. They conducted it to the edge
of national annihilation. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But now salvation was at hand:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In Mr Churchill as premier, and in his three service
supply chiefs, Ernest Bevin, Herbert Morrison, and Lord Beaverbrook
(to name only four) we have an assurance that all that is within the
range of human achievement will be done to make this island &#8216;a
fortress&#8217;. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>In the Popular Front vice</h4>

<p class="fst">If the leadership of the Labour Party during the war was the
complete prisoner of social patriotism, the Labour Left was the
prisoner of Popular Frontism. Its arguments for reforms, for social
change, were always in terms of the national interest. In the pages of
Tribune for example, Nye Bevan wrote: &#8216;If the Tory members of the
Government carry their defence of private property rights to the
extent of refusing the public ownership [of land, mines and railways]
then we shall lose the war.&#8217; <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a> The
class-nation synthesis, which is the essence of reformism, applied to
the Left as much as to the right.</p>

<p>A central theme in <strong>Tribune</strong> from 1941 onwards was that the
profit system impeded the war effort, that national needs called for
the power of capital to be restricted. Again and again the call for
nationalisation, of mines or railways, was put forward in the name
not of working-class interests, but of the national interest. Thus
Bevan&#8217;s argument for raising the old age pension was:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It is most important for maintaining national unity and
morale at the present time.</p>

<p class="quote">We are very anxious to preserve <em>the fa&#231;ade of
national unity</em> for a year or so because we are still going to
face great military adventures. Why do Hon. Members not help us to
preserve it? <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Even when Bevan was most critical of the coalition government he
still did not see its policy as an <em>inevitable</em> outcome of the
class which dominated it. For instance he wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Labour has brought about no change of importance on the
economic front ... Why is this? There is no reason why it should be
so ... If Labour insisted upon it, if Labour demands, that the
railways shall be nationalised as an essential step towards the
successful prosecution of the war, no vested interest would dare
raise any objection. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The main crime of the ruling class, it seemed, was not
exploitation but incompetence. Bevan criticised Churchill, not as a
defender of ruling-class power, but for his failure to agree that &#8216;
<em>There is one dominant consideration and that is to win the war.</em>
Property as well as men should be commandeered by the state.&#8217; <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>

<p>While the Tribune Group was still following the Popular Front
policy it adopted before the war, there were some crucial differences.</p>

<p>In the 1930s the Socialist League and the Tribune Group shadowed
the Communist Party. Those links were gone. Mixed with Laski&#8217;s
references to Russia as a &#8216;socialist commonwealth&#8217; <a href="#n29a" name="f29a">[29a]</a>,
and G.D.H. Cole&#8217;s suggestion that &#8216;the best solution for Germany
might be in co-operation in an enlarged USSR&#8217; <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a>,
were other statements very critical of Russia. Thus Raymond Postgate,
editor of <strong>Tribune</strong>, could write a few months before the Nazi
invasion of Russia:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Just as I would have nothing to do with Himmler, Ley or
the Commandant of Dachau Camp, nor believe a word they say, so I will
have nothing personally or politically to do with Communist Party
chiefs, nor sit on Committees, nor attend meetings where I might have
to meet them, nor pay any attention to propaganda that they start.
<a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A few months before the end of the war an editorial in <strong>Tribune</strong>
stated: &#8216;The Soviet Union wishes to carve up Eastern Germany in
order to have her own Quisling Government in Poland. That, of course,
is naked power politics.&#8217; <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p>Although <strong>Tribune</strong> opposed the Communist Party&#8217;s extreme
anti-German chauvinism it did not advocate a policy of &#8216;neither
Washington nor Moscow&#8217; but &#8216;both Washington and Moscow&#8217;: the
bridge between the two powers could be strengthened by small nations
and the United Nations.</p>

<p>Thus an editorial in <strong>Tribune</strong> welcomed the &#8216;Yalta
conference of Britain, Russia and the USA&#8217;. This met on 11 February
1945. It was the last blaze of mutual harmony among the Allies. It
was also one of the most coldly calculated imperialist meetings since
the Versailles Conference in 1919. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a></p>

<p>But despite its illusions, the Labour left became differentiated
from the mainstream. When reality obviously failed to match the
Popular Front icon, doubts surfaced. Failures on the military front
in 1942 led <strong>Tribune</strong> to print the headline, &#8216;War Office:
Architect of Defeat&#8217;. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a> The impact
of the fall of Tobruk, when Rommel captured 33,000 prisoners, was so
great that in a parliamentary by-election the solid Tory seat of
Malden was lost to Tom Driberg, a left-wing socialist standing as an Independent.</p>

<p>Even arch-right-wingers like Lord Beaverbrook began intriguing to
get rid of Churchill. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> In July Sir
John Wardlow Milne, an influential backbench Conservative and
chairman of the All-Party Select Committee on National Expenditure,
moved censure on the Government and &#8216;no confidence in the central
direction of the war.&#8217; The seconder was a Tory Admiral of the Fleet.</p>

<p>The second morning of the debate was opened by Bevan with a
massive attack on the government, on the War Office, on the generals:
the main strategy of the war was wrong. The wrong weapons had been
produced, and those weapons were managed by men not properly trained
in their use. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a> The cross-party
opposition, however, mustered only 25 votes against 475 for the government.</p>

<p>A few weeks after this debate Bevan launched an even more vigorous
attack on Churchill: &#8216;... the Prime Minister&#8217;s continuation in
office is a major national disaster. He is no longer able to summon
the spirit of the British people, because he represents policies that
they deeply distrust.&#8217; <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>

<p>Bevan and the Tribune Group did question the effectiveness of
Labour&#8217;s parliamentary strategy, yet they did so from within a
shared premise about the centrality of parliamentary politics and the
need for national unity and defence. The Popular Front policy in the
1930s strengthened the reformism of the Labour Left. Even after the
Communist Party ceased to influence it, the politics of Stalinism,
the muddledness and crudity of its &#8216;Marxism&#8217; continued to mould
left Labour thinking. This continued in different forms throughout
the 1950s and beyond.</p>

<p>It was impossible for the Labour left to be consistent. Support of
the &#8216;war for democracy&#8217; did not square with Britain allying
itself with semi-fascist and reactionary regimes. Labour was a member
of the coalition government that allowed a most reactionary home as
well as foreign policy. This implicated the party in the brutal
suppression of the Indian people, and collaboration with the likes of
Admiral Darlan and Marshal Badoglio. Such a policy made a mockery of
progressive aims. The Labour left never resolved its conflict of
loyalty between principles and being inside a party that is not in
opposition but in government.</p>

<p>The extraordinary contrasts and shifts of the left during the war
years stemmed from a desire to defeat fascism which sometimes led
them to suggest ways of waging the war which would only have been
possible for a revolutionary workers&#8217; government. But their attempt
to fit workers&#8217; demands within the framework of the national
capitalist state continually led them to fall back on talk of
cross-class alliances, and therefore into a position where workers
were subordinated to the needs of British imperialism.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Towards the summit of reformism</h4>

<p class="fst">Under capitalism crisis can take many forms. The slump of the
1930s was one form. The Second World War was another. It is through
capitalist crisis, when &#8216;normal&#8217; society is dislocated and
classes are forced to rethink their positions, that fundamental
change can occur. The result is by no means automatic &#8211; change can
mean descent into fascism, but it can mean many other things too.</p>

<p>The Second World War, like the first, created full employment. It
also showed that unlike the parasitic capitalists, the working class
are the real productive force in society. In the late 1930s workers
had already begun to flex their collective muscles after the long
sleep. Now the war, through its multitude of large and small
transformations in daily life, gave them a new confidence and militancy.</p>

<p>One aspect was particularly galling. Although Labour participation
in government was supposed to show that all classes were in the war
effort on an equal footing, workers could not help noticing that, in
Rosa Luxemburg&#8217;s phrase: &#8216;profits are springing, like weeds, from
the fields of the dead.&#8217; <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a> There
was profiteering and the black market. Fortunes were made. One author recounted</p>

<p class="quoteb">that he had been auditing the accounts of a builders&#8217;
merchant who had earned a thousand pounds a year from his business
before the war, but in the last year had drawn over fifteen thousand
pounds in director&#8217;s fees &#8211; this for a small firm employing half
a dozen people. The same accountant spoke of two war factories where
the auditors had insisted on paying out the wages themselves, and had
found that hundreds of pounds were reaching the firms in respect of
non-existent workers.</p>

<p class="quote">These tales were not the carefully selected ammunition of
a lonely red revolutionary. The buses, and even the newspapers, were
noisy with such anecdotes. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The profiteering was of course a symptom. The wartime government
policies meant an increase in the rate at which workers were being
exploited, and while their so-called leaders were willing to turn a
blind eye to this, workers were not. One aspect of their response was
increasing organisation. Trade union membership, which had been in
the region of four and a half million before the war, approached
seven million by its end. Even more significant were the strikes,
which all involved unofficial, rank and file action, independent of
the union bureaucracy:</p>

<p class="fst">The 3,714,000 strike days of 1944 were not only higher than the
decade preceding the war, they were only surpassed again in 1955.
Two-thirds of the strike days came from the coal industry, the
highest figure since 1932, while the number of strikes, 2,194, was
the highest since records began.</p>

<p>A historian of the period compared the strike levels in the Second
World War with those of the first:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Taking the yearly average for the two periods 1939&#8211;1945
and 1914&#8211;1918 the number of stoppp.&nbsp;was 1,527 as compared to
814 &#8211; in both wars the greatest number occurring during the last
year of hostilities. On the other hand, the number of workers
directly or indirectly involved in stoppp.&nbsp;of work was smaller
in the Second World War &#8211; 480,000 as compared with 632,000 in the
earlier war. Secondly, the aggregate number of days lost was only
1,900,000 by contrast with 5,360,000 between 1914 and 1918, as most
of the stoppp.&nbsp;were of relatively short duration. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Second World War, unlike the first, had not interrupted a
period of titanic class conflict or been influenced by Bolshevism. It
followed years of working-class passivity. It claimed to be
conquering the evils of fascism. And from 1941 the Communist Party,
now at the height of its influence, put its efforts into preventing
strikes. Crucially, the Second World War produced nothing like the
onslaught on working-class standards that had been experienced in the first.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there were important disputes, including engineering
apprentices, shipyard workers and many others. One important struggle
was against the conscription of young men into the mines &#8211; the
&#8216;Bevin boys&#8217;. <a href="#nd" name="fd">[4*]</a> In another 30,000
Belfast workers struck against the imprisonment of five of their shop stewards.</p>

<p>But the most strike-prone industry was undoubtedly mining, the
outstanding stoppage being at Betteshanger colliery in Kent. In
January 1942 its 1,620 miners went on strike over a wage claim. Three
branch officials were sentenced to imprisonment because of the
strike, and others were fined but refused to pay. It was soon obvious
that there was no way to imprison a thousand miners. The home
secretary decided to recommend remission of the sentences on the
three officials, so they were freed. By May 1942 only nine of the
miners had paid their fines. The miners won their wage claim.
Spectacular though it was, Betteshanger was just one miners&#8217; strike
among many even larger affairs:</p>

<p class="quoteb">in the whole year 1944 the number involved in mining
disputes were no less than 568,000. The duration in working days of
all disputes that year was 2,480,000, a figure that had only once
been exceeded in the previous seventeen years. But a still more
significant figure is the number of disputes, big and small. There
were no less than 1,253 disputes in 1944, half as many again as in
the preceding year, 1943, which year had the highest total of
disputes since the beginning of the century. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The impact of class struggle on the left</h4>

<p class="fst">The role of the Labour left, which had only recently conflicted so
seriously with the leadership, is interesting. One instance during
1944 was Nye Bevan&#8217;s trip to a miners&#8217; strike in South Wales:</p>

<p class="quoteb">to urge the men first to accept the original award,
whatever the anomalies, and later to call off their unofficial strike
action. He went to the second round of meetings following a pressing
private appeal from Ernest Bevin himself. Other MPs from the mining
areas had done the same. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Although the Labour left were not prepared to advance working
class self-activity, they did try to halt government intervention
against it. Thus Labour backbenchers stormily rebelled against
Regulation 1AA. Spearheading the attack, Bevan accused Bevin of
working up a campaign of calumny against the miners through the
press, and trying to cover up the failure of the government&#8217;s
industrial policy, especially in the mines, by starting a witch-hunt
against agitators:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Cartoons in the public press and articles written by
highly-paid propagandists in the millionaire newspapers made our task
almost impossible when we went to address meetings in the coalfields.
The miners came out on strike because of real grievances, he said.</p>

<p class="fst">He went on:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Do not let anybody on this side of the House think that
[Ernest Bevin] is defending the trade unions; he is defending the
trade union official, who has arterial sclerosis, and who cannot
readjust himself to his membership. He is defending an official who
has become so unpopular among his own membership that the only way he
can keep them in order is to threaten them with five years in gaol. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The strength of feeling among the Labour backbenchers was shown by
the voting on Regulation 1AA. The government majority was convincing
enough: 314 to 23 with about 70 abstentions. But only 56 out of 165
Labour MPs voted in support of Bevin, and that with a three-line
whip. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a></p>

<p>Bevan&#8217;s behaviour enraged the Labour leadership and Arthur
Greenwood proposed his expulsion from the party. He described Bevan&#8217;s
speech as &#8216;a speech of anti-trade union character the like of which
I have never heard from the most diehard Tory in the House or outside
the House.&#8217; <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a> However, at the
first meeting of the PLP no decision was reached. The next meeting
was the best attended for years. Attlee spoke for expulsion, but the
leaders could not get their way. By 71 to 60 an amendment moved by
Shinwell was carried which was against immediate action &#8216;in view of
the probability of a general election in the next twelve months.&#8217; <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a></p>

<p>However an ultimatum was given to Bevan demanding a loyalty pledge
from him to avoid expulsion. Next day Bevan gave it. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a>
But the Labour right wing and the TUC refused to be satisfied with
the compromise achieved. Bevan was reported to the Miners&#8217;
Federation, which sponsored him as an MP, and the union&#8217;s executive
added its censure to that already passed by the General Council, and
adopted a resolution supporting the TUC and Labour Party in their
stand on Regulation 1AA. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a></p>

<p>However Bevan had considerable backing within individual unions.
South Wales, Scotland and Cumberland Areas of the Miners&#8217;
Federation, the engineering workers (AEU), the train drivers (ASLEF),
the shopworkers (NUDAW), the Chemical Workers&#8217; Union, the Civil
Service Clerical Union and the Tobacco Workers&#8217; Union, all strongly
opposed Regulation 1AA. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a></p>

<p>In fact the Labour left now, as in the 1930s, had little contact
with workers&#8217; struggles. In <strong>Tribune</strong> one finds hardly an echo
of the strikes that took place, with the exception of the miners
(after all, Bevan was a miners&#8217; MP). But even then the paper was
not <em>agitating</em> for strikes, but only reporting them as a sad
fact of life. <strong>Tribune</strong> protested against Regulation 1AA, but
never agitated for the workers&#8217; demands which spurred the
government on to introduce this regulation. <strong>Tribune</strong> argued for
joint production committees, for increasing effort by workers to
raise productivity, for opposition to the use of the strike weapon;
it never agitated for strike action to raise wages.</p>

<p>Yet once more it was the forward thrust of the working class
itself that had opened the way to new reformist advance, just like in
the First World War. It was in the summer of 1943, as struggle moved
towards the point at which Bevin felt compelled to institute
Regulation 1AA, that Nye Bevan called for a new political realignment
&#8211; a coalition of the left. Thus on 18 June he called for the
affiliation to the Labour Party of the Communist Party, Common Wealth
(a left-wing party formed during the war), the ILP and a Radical
Liberal Group formed of left-wing Liberals. <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a>
A few months later <strong>Tribune</strong> called for an &#8216;Alliance of the
Left&#8217; of Liberals, Labour, Common Wealth, ILP and Communists <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a>,
and this was repeated in one issue after another.</p>

<p>There were other signs that the old politics were breaking up and
a new current was being created under the impact of world events and
the rise of working-class pressure. One was increasing tension in the
parliamentary field.</p>

<p>In 1939 the Labour Party had accepted a by-election truce. By this
agreement, the party that had previously won the seat would have the
right, when it fell vacant, to nominate a candidate approved by the
other two parties. The truce held until the autumn of 1941 when it
became apparent that a sizeable proportion of the electorate were
ready to support Independents against official Conservative
candidates where no Labour or Liberal candidates were put forward.</p>

<p>ILP candidates in 1941 had polled a steady 20&#8211;30 per cent of the
vote in various constituencies, presumably because Labour supporters
saw this as a way of protesting. In 1942 four Independents were
victorious, all against Conservative nominees. That July the Common
Wealth Party was established, very much as a protest against the
electoral truce. At its peak Common Wealth had 15,000 members, mainly
from the liberal professions.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Between the spring of 1941 and the end of 1942, nineteen
Labour seats fell vacant and two of them were contested. Twenty-
eight Conservative seats fell vacant, nineteen were contested, and
three lost. In other words, the by-election independent knew his
trade &#8211; blame the Tories &#8211; and the voters responded. <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In April 1943 Common Wealth won its first seat in a rural
constituency in Cheshire. Others followed at Skipton and West
Derbyshire. Brighton was one of the safest Tory seats in the country,
yet the Tory majority of 40,000 was reduced to less than 2,000 by an
Independent challenge. A fortnight later, in West Derbyshire, a
Conservative majority of 5,500 turned into an independent socialist
majority of 4,500. In April 1945 a Common Wealth candidate swept the
Conservative out of the hitherto safe seat of Chelmsford with a
phenomenal turnover of 23,000 votes.</p>

<p>These defeats occurred notwithstanding the fact that Churchill,
Attlee, Ernest Brown (for the National Liberals) and Sinclair (for
the Liberals) sent a joint letter to all constituents saying:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The verdict recorded by a single constituency is flashed
around the world as though it were the voice of Britain that had
spoken ... it has the responsibility at this moment of indicating to
the United Nations, and to neutral countries, that we are united
among ourselves in our unflinching determination to organize our
total resources for victory. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Local Labour Parties were under orders to co-operate in the return
of Conservatives or at least take no part against them. The rank and
file found this infuriating. Even so, not one of the leaders of the
Labour Party, not even Nye Bevan, suggested that Labour should
withdraw from the government. However Bevan urged a clear declaration
by the Labour Party that it would fight independently of the Tories
at the first post-war election. Further, from 1942 onwards he called
on the Labour Party to break the by-election truce agreed upon at the
beginning of the war.</p>

<p>That year the party executive put a motion to conference
committing the party not merely to abstain from putting up candidates
in by-elections, but to give active support to government candidates
in by-elections, whatever party they came from. Resistance was
massive: the resolution passed by a narrow majority &#8211; 1,275,000 to
1,209,000 votes. The miners, engineers and railwaymen voted against it.</p>

<p>At the next Labour Party Conference, Attlee won the extension of
the electoral truce on the grounds that to break it would mean an end
of the coalition and the death of any chance of Labour&#8217;s
influencing post-war planning. The majority was convincing: 2,243,000
to 374,000.</p>

<p>Part of the left&#8217;s weakness arose from its extremely equivocal
attitude to the government. It veered wildly from supporting the
coalition to wanting to end it. A few examples will illustrate. On 11
December 1942 Bevan wrote a <strong>Tribune</strong> article which said that
the presence of Labour ministers</p>

<p class="quoteb">in the government is no protection against the most
reactionary Tory policies being adopted. Nor can it now be said that
the Labour members of the Government are doing anything which could
not be done at least equally well by a Tory Minister ... Has not the
time come for Labour to regain its freedom and set itself at the head
of the British people in their march to the new world? <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In October 1944 he argued the opposite: &#8216;it would be foolish to
break up the National Government now. I think our representatives are
entitled to say that, having gone so far, they must complete the
journey and remain in the Government until Germany is defeated.&#8217;
<a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a> Just two months later this line
was reversed once more, as Bevan called for the dissolution of the
coalition government. <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a></p>

<p><strong>Tribune</strong> was equally hard to track. In March 1943 it
favoured preservation of the Coalition: The dilemma for labour is a
painful one, for it involves the question of whether Labour should
leave the National Government. This ... would be a mistake ... If
great British and American armies are sent into battle, they must do
so as far as possible with united nations behind.&#8217; <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a>
Some months later the opposite was argued: &#8216;The Coalition is dead.
Let us bury it quickly.&#8217; <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a> Within
a year the paper reverted to its original stance: &#8216;Having persisted
so far, it is reasonable for the parties forming the Government to
hold together until the task which brought them into coalition is
performed; the defeat of Nazi Germany.&#8217; <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a></p>

<p>The Labour left could not make up its own mind, because it could
not decide its true allegiance &#8211; to the class collaborationist
policies of Attlee and Co, or to the workers. So it always fell
between two stools. It opposed the electoral truce but supported the
coalition. It called on the Labour Party to end the truce, but did
not take part in the electoral activities that would force it to do this.</p>

<p>A growing workers&#8217; movement and the ripples of discontent it
generated within the Labour Party were only a part of the profound
changes that were taking place. The ruling class was also re-shaping
its ideas. For a party which seeks to mediate between the upper and
nether millstones of capitalist society, this had far-reaching consequences.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&#8216;We are all Keynesians now&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">When the Second World War began it ended the more or less
uninterrupted economic decline that stretched back to 1920. Wartime
expedients seemed to solve problems that had baffled the conventional
economic wisdom, itself little changed since Gladstone&#8217;s day.</p>

<p>The most obvious difference was the level of state involvement in
the general management of the economy. This got a massive fillip as a
result of the war. By 1941 about 49 per cent of the total occupied
population was engaged in some type of employment for the government.
<a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a> With full employment for the first
time for two decades, the idea that this could be maintained by state
demand management became very widespread. For leading politicians of
all parties the doctrine put forward by J.M. Keynes had been fully
vindicated. According to Keynes, the prime responsibility of
government was to use fiscal and monetary policy to ensure that there
was enough effective demand in the economy to maintain full
employment, but not so much as to cause &#8216;demand-pull&#8217; inflation.</p>

<p>Before the war there were already a number of politicians who
accepted Keynes&#8217;s doctrine. Among the Labour people by far the most
prominent early convert was Ernest Bevin. From the mid-1930s a number
of Labour Party intellectuals were Keynesian converts: Douglas Jay,
Evan Durbin, Anthony Crosland, and Hugh Gaitskell. These were on the
right wing of the party. However some left-wingers moved towards
Keynes, the most prominent being Strachey.</p>

<p>In 1932&#8211;5 Strachey wrote three books, <strong>The Coming Struggle for
Power</strong>, <strong>The Menace of Fascism</strong> and <strong>The Nature of the
Capitalist Crisis</strong>, in which he claimed to be an orthodox Marxist
(even though he was in fact much influenced by Stalinism). But in
1938 he wrote to the barrister and hard-line Stalinist Palme Dutt:
&#8216;If, for good or evil, we have adopted People&#8217;s Front politics,
we must have a People&#8217;s Front economics also.&#8217; <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a>
On the eve of the war the need for class collaboration strengthened
further Strachey&#8217;s search for a solution of the crisis of
capitalism without overthrowing it. He wrote on 2 October 1938:</p>

<p class="quoteb">the British people must be made to feel that those who
ask them to, at least, risk fighting and dying for their country are
determined to preserve their country and to improve those features
which make it worth living in, and therefore dying for, e.g. its
democracy, in the widest sense of that term ... [and] a determination
just as great as that shown by the fascists to deal with unemployment
<em>doubt on Keynesist lines</em>. In two words, a &#8216;progressive
patriotism&#8217; must be the positive note struck. <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1940 Strachey published a new book, <strong>A Programme for
Progress</strong>. This argued that while in the long run socialism was
the only remedy for the breakdown of capitalism, in the short run
what was needed was an interim programme for reforming capitalism
similar to that of Roosevelt&#8217;s New Deal. His programme included six
main points: the extension of public enterprise, low interest rates
on loan capital, increased social services, including monetary
allowances to individuals, and a redistributory taxation. There would
also be a state controlled banking system and strict public control
over the balance of payments. <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a></p>

<p>This programme was so minimalist that Crosland could say: &#8216;It
was incomparably more modest than the programme the Labour Party
adopted in 1937.&#8217; <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a></p>

<p>There were a number of converts to Keynesianism among the Tories.
Harold Macmillan, a Conservative MP, published <strong>Reconstruction: A
Plea for a National Policy</strong>, and <strong>The Middle Way</strong> in 1938.
Thirty-six Tory MPs in 1943 formally constituted themselves into the
Tory Reform Committee under the chairmanship of Lord Hinchingbrooke,
who wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">True Conservative opinion is horrified at the damage done
to this country since the last war by &#8216;individualist&#8217;
business-men, financiers, and speculators ranging freely in a
<em>laissez-faire</em> economy and creeping unnoticed into the fold of
Conservatism to insult the Party with their vote at elections ... I
would wish nothing better than that these men should collect their
baggage and depart. <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was one of the members of the Reform Committee, Quintin Hogg,
who told the House of Commons: &#8216;If you do not give the people
social reforms they are going to give you social revolution.&#8217;
Harold Macmillan, R.A. Butler and Anthony Eden, being in the
government, could not belong to the Tory Reform Committee, but had
sympathy with it.</p>

<p>Capitalism must be preserved, said the Reform Committee, but the
state could play a positive role in promoting its efficiency, and
this might include nationalisation measures. Thus the committee
argued for the nationalisation of electricity, gas and water, while
excluding coal mining. Similar ideas regarding the mixed economy were
put forward by Labour politicians from as diverse backgrounds as
Morrison and Cripps.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s shift from verbal opposition to capitalism to
consciously trying to run it in its best interests involved a
dramatic break with its past. As late as 1937 Attlee&#8217;s book, <strong>The
Labour Party in Perspective</strong>, had argued that socialism equalled
nationalisation and this would lead to the abolition of classes. Such
ideas were sprinkled throughout the book:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The evils that Capitalism brings differ in intensity in
different countries, but, the root cause of the trouble once
discerned, the remedy is seen to be the same by thoughtful men and
women. The cause is the private ownership of the means of life; the
remedy is public ownership. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a></p>

<p class="quote">The aim of socialism is the nationalisation of all
industries. All the major industries will be owned and controlled by
the community ... <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a></p>

<p class="quote">The abolition of classes is fundamental to the Socialist
conception of society. <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Whatever reservations might be held about Labour&#8217;s ability to
carry these through, such positions summed up the long-held beliefs
that first inspired the socialists of the ILP, and once enshrined in
Clause Four were held to be the property of the entire Labour Party.</p>

<p>Now, during the war, the Labour leaders started rewriting the
political dictionary. The aim of Labour became the &#8216;Mixed Economy&#8217;.
In the words of Herbert Morrison:</p>

<p class="quoteb">a practical mixture of genuine socialism and genuinely
free enterprise, the whole resting upon and in turn supporting
national policies of social and industrial welfare ... Public
ownership where it is appropriate, stimulating public control
elsewhere. <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Nationalisation had once been held to be the cornerstone of a
socialist society and to be the policy that separated Labour
fundamentally from capitalism. Now Cripps argued that control of
industry did not require its nationalisation. On 12 October 1944 he
wrote to Richard Acland: &#8216;Oh, no, my dear Richard. We have learnt
in the war that we <em>can</em> control industry.&#8217; <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a>
Attlee himself pointed to the increasing consensus between Labour and
Tory leaders about State intervention in industry: &#8216;It colours all
our discussions on home economic policy.&#8217; <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a></p>

<p>One expression of the way Keynesian ideas had come to dominate
political thinking was the government <em>White Paper on Employment
Policy</em>, of May 1944. This marked the Treasury&#8217;s conversion to
the use of fiscal means to avoid cyclical unemployment. When Bevin
introduced the White Paper to the Commons he explained that the
passive acceptance of deflation and unemployment would be replaced by
active, conscious direction of the economy for the first time.
Government would confront &#8216;any depression at an early stage by
expanding and not contracting capital expenditure, and by raising
consumption expenditure and not reducing it.&#8217; <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a></p>

<p>Keynes seemed to promise a prosperous capitalism in which state
intervention was to play a stabilising role. Nationalisation was
irrelevant to this. As he put it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It is not the ownership of the instruments of production
which it is important for the State to assume. If the State is able
to determine the aggregate amount of resources directed to augmenting
the instruments and the basic rate of reward to those who own them,
it will have accomplished all that is necessary. <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus Keynes&#8217; ideas were attractive to right-wing Labour leaders,
who were attached to gradualism, hence to the mixed economy.</p>

<p>Of course not all Labour leaders accepted Keynes&#8217; panacea. Bevan
argued in the House of Commons that such ideas were incompatible with
socialism. He did not believe Labour should accept the White Paper,
for if it did so, he argued, there would not</p>

<p class="quoteb">... be any argument for Socialism and no reason for it
... The subjects dealt with by the White Paper represent all the
matters which distinguish that side of the House from this. The
question of how the work of society is to be organised, how the
income of society is to be distributed, to what extent the State is
to intervene in the direction of economic affairs &#8211; all these are
questions which first called this party into existence ... Indeed, I
will go so far as to say that, if the implications of the White Paper
are sound, there is no longer any justification for this party
existing at all. <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The debate between the moderate Labour leaders&#8217; policy of
administering the capitalist economy and Bevan&#8217;s critique of them
was to dominate Labour thinking for a generation.</p>

<p>One should not suppose that since both centrist Tory and Labour
leaders accepted Keynes, this consensus meant the <em>identity</em> of
the two camps. Both accepted the objectives of full employment,
reasonably rapid growth, stable prices and a satisfactory balance of
payments. But Tory leaders put a different emphasis on the various
objectives. Keynesians accepted that there was a trade-off between
unemployment and inflation: the lower the level of unemployment the
more intense the pressure of demand for labour, the faster will be
the rate of inflation. For the Tory Party, as an open capitalist
party depending very much on middle-class voters, people who have
some savings, the emphasis would be on preventing inflation. For the
Labour Party, whose voters are overwhelmingly workers without any
financial cushion against unemployment, the emphasis was far more on jobs.</p>

<p>Labour Keynesians also emphasised greater economic equality. They
believed that raising wages and improving welfare would themselves
tend to increase demand, thus stimulating production and reducing unemployment.</p>

<p>Keynsianism was the most important new economic orthodoxy. But
there were other new trends at work in the area of industrial
relations and social reform.</p>

<p>One important development during the Second World War was the
close cooperation between government and trade unions. This was a
continuation of the &#8216;Mondism&#8217; of the late 1920s. The 1928
Mond-Turner talks had been abortive, since the conditions of the
slump of 1929 made it superfluous for management to take union
leaders into their confidence, but in the partial recovery after 1932
such cooperation did produce some results. Trade unions, especially
the two general unions &#8211; the Transport and General (TGWU) and the
General and Municipal (GMWU) &#8211; established cosy relationships with
a number of major employers and became involved in a growing number
of state-sponsored bodies. This cooperation was symbolised by the
granting of knighthoods to three prominent figures &#8211; Walter
Citrine, TUC Secretary, Arthur Pugh of the Iron and Steel Trades
Confederation, and the Labour Chief Whip Charles Edwards &#8211; in the
Silver Jubilee Honours List of 1935.</p>

<p>During the war, with Ernest Bevin, a former general secretary of
the TGWU, running the ministry of labour, and with the government in
urgent need of trade union cooperation to preserve industrial peace
at a critical period, the trade union leaders were incorporated into
state activity: &#8216;... trade union leaders became members of the
large number of wartime committees which took over functions
previously fulfilled by private industry and tackled new ones arising
out of war needs.&#8217; <a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a> As TUC
general secretary, Sir Walter Citrine found himself serving on some
30 public or semi-public bodies. <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a>
At the end of the war he could tell Congress: &#8216;We have passed from
the era of propaganda to one of responsibility.&#8217; <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Beveridge Report</h4>

<p class="fst">In December 1942 the <em>Beveridge Report</em> was published. This proposed
a comprehensive scheme for social insurance against illness, poverty
and unemployment, plus proposals for a national health service,
family allowances and the maintenance of full employment.</p>

<p>The report&#8217;s assumptions about social reform fully accorded with
the new Keynesian economics. Beveridge took for granted that the
government would secure a high level of employment after the war,
that it would introduce family allowances, and that it would devise a
comprehensive health service for all. The <em>Plan for Social
Security</em> which Beveridge drew up in the main body of the report
was a rationalisation of existing financial arrangements, so that in
return for a single weekly contribution, wage earners, the
self-employed, and their families would receive old age pensions and
sickness benefit. Former wage earners would receive unemployment pay.</p>

<p>Yet the scheme was not as radical as Beveridge claimed. <a href="#ne" name="fe">[5*]</a>
For example it considered the principle of a national minimum for old
age pensioners to be so expensive that it could not be fully
implemented for twenty years. Nevertheless, no official report has
ever aroused greater popular interest and enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The public welcome given to the report was well-nigh
universal. The national press, with the exception of the <strong>Daily
Telegraph</strong>, behaved as though it fell only slightly short of the
millennium. A total of 635,000 copies were sold. A survey of opinion
... showed that 86 per cent believed that the report should be
adopted, as against 6 per cent who though it should be dropped. <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This is not to say the report was received uncritically.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Nearly three out of five people thought the proposed
pension rates too low. But the overall popularity of the report was
established beyond a doubt, and the idea of free doctors and hospital
services for all was approved by 88 per cent, including 81 per cent
of the wealthier. <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Beveridge, however, had put the Tories&#8217; backs up. &#8216;Churchill
is reported to have taken strong exception to the Report, to have
refused to see its author and forbidden any government department to
allow him inside its doors.&#8217; <a href="#n83" name="f83">[83]</a> The
government did all in its power to stifle publicity for the report
and make plain that its contents were disapproved of. <a href="#n84" name="f84">[84]</a></p>

<p>The National Council of Labour, representing both the Labour Party
and TUC, endorsed the <em>Beveridge Report</em>, as did the Liberal Party
(Beveridge was, after all, a Liberal himself). Soon the British
Council of Churches followed suit. A good many Conservatives also
welcomed it enthusiastically.</p>

<p>A three-day debate on the <em>Beveridge Report</em> took place in the House
of Commons on 16&#8211;18 February 1943. Hardline Tories were for full
implementation at some date no closer than Doomsday. Labour, tied by
its coalition commitments, took an official position of no more than
lukewarm approval and for very gradual implementation.</p>

<p>But a Labour MP, James Griffiths, put down an amendment calling
for prompt legislation: the House &#8216;expresses its dissatisfaction
with the now declared policy of His Majesty&#8217;s Government towards
the Report of Sir William Beveridge on Social Insurance and Allied
Services and urges the reconsideration of that policy with a view to
the early implementation of the plan.&#8217; Attlee, Morrison and Bevin
tried to counter the revolt at a private meeting of the PLP. A
three-line whip was hurriedly organised by both Tories and Labour.</p>

<p>But the Labour backbenchers rebelled. Notwithstanding a very
conciliatory and clever speech by Morrison for the coalition, the
whole PLP turned on the government. In the division on 18 February,
121 votes were cast against the government: ninety-seven Labour,
three ILP, one Communist, eleven Independents and nine Liberals.
About thirty Labour MPs abstained. Of the twenty-three Labour members
who voted for the government, twenty-two were ministers.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Towards the first majority Labour government</h4>

<p class="fst">The Second World War ended in different circumstances to the
First. Above all in 1945 the world entered the longest boom in
capitalist history. Naturally its benefits were unequally shared, but
it did help defuse the inevitable demands that workers were to make
after the heavy sacrifices of the war years.</p>

<p>On the economic front the First World War had ended with a
&#8216;bonfire of controls&#8217; as bosses sought to return to the palmy
days of Queen Victoria and <em>laissez-faire</em> success. Their
efforts had ended in slump. In 1945 capitalists knew that there could
be no going back to the 1930s.</p>

<p>In the general election of July 1945 Attlee&#8217;s party raised its
share of the vote by one-third to twelve million votes. With 393
Labour MPs, it now had a crushing majority over the 210 Conservatives
and twelve Liberals in parliament. The election was just one symptom
of a massive change in workers&#8217; attitudes that had been brought by
the experience of war. The ideas of people like Nye Bevan now fitted
the mood of the millions who had seen full employment in wartime, and
the potential to use full employment in peacetime to banish poverty,
misery and victimisation. Even the armed forces, still swollen to
massive proportions, began to mutiny in Egypt, India and Malaya,
demanding to be released from service. The rank and file soldiers
could not have been used to halt major social change.</p>

<p>In these circumstances MacDonald&#8217;s old excuse of being &#8216;in
office but not in power&#8217; was of no avail, and Labour faced a
tremendous opportunity to achieve that constitutional transition to
socialism that it had talked about so ardently. But the Labour Party
too had changed during the war. Its synthesis of class and nation
remained, but it had a new twist: &#8216;what was good for the workers &#8211;
fair wages, better housing, better pensions &#8211; was good for the
nation.&#8217; The criticism of capitalism, and the acceptance of
capitalism, were combined in a new form.</p>

Service Officers&#8217; Order, or for leaving their employment. Of this
total, 143 were sentenced to prison. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a></p>

course of time the better stocks have come to the top. A good stock
is not permanently kept down; it forces its way up in the course of
generations of social change, and so the upper classes are on the
whole the better classes.&#8217; <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a></p>
