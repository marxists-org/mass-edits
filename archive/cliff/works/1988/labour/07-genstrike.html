<h3>The Labour Party</h3>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h1>7. General Strike and Aftermath</h1>

<br/>
<p class="quoteb">&#8216;You must understand that the Labour Party and its
Parliamentary leaders or representatives <em>had nothing to do with
it</em>.&#8217; (Secret letter of Sidney Webb to George Bernard Shaw, 13
May 1926) <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">WHEN the Labour Party was first mooted in 1892 the promise was
for: &#8216;something more than a mere Electoral Club ... It is an
organisation formed to rouse, to educate, to unite the vast inert
masses of the workers and to give the strength of sympathy and
cohesion. It will do more than bring out Labour candidates ... It
will give assistance to the workers in all trade disputes and
crises.&#8217; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> Better than any other
single event, the General Strike showed whether that vision matched reality.</p>

<p>In the General Strike the Party had to choose between a movement
which was in form, if not in intention, <em>a direct challenge to the
state</em>. Secondly, it clarified <em>Labour&#8217;s relationship to the
workers&#8217; mass activity</em>. Next the strike demonstrated the
underlying <em>unity of the union bureaucracy with the party</em> and
their interest in separating politics and economics. Finally, the
results of the strike proved conclusively that <em>Labour&#8217;s
political fortunes are linked to the working-class movement, but that
the connection is wholly parasitic.<br/>
&nbsp;</em></p>

<h4 class="western">Background</h4>

<p class="fst">Just as the Labour Party has a number of reformist currents within
it, so the union bureaucracy is not homogeneous either. Union
officials are under varying pressures from below and above. Although
they ultimately defend their common group interest, they may choose
different methods to the same end.</p>

<p>In the period after the first Labour government (and partially
because of disappointment with that administration) the TUC was
dominated by left-wingers like George Hicks, Alfred Purcell and
Alonzo Swales. They were apparently determined to keep Labour&#8217;s
nose out of their affairs, &#8216;erecting impenetrable barriers between
33 and 32 Eccleston Square&#8217; (the respective headquarters of the two
organisations). <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> In reality the
semi-revolutionary speeches of Hicks and Co were designed not to
overthrow the system but to ginger up the unions.</p>

<p>Events seemed to be going the way of the TUC lefts when, on &#8216;Red
Friday&#8217;, 31 August 1925, the threat of united strike action
compelled Baldwin&#8217;s government to subsidise miners&#8217; wages for
nine months. In general, workers took Red Friday to be a great
victory, a triumph for their collective strength.</p>

<p>Naturally the Labour leadership were appalled. MacDonald&#8217;s
reaction to Red Friday was astounding in its frankness:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Government) has simply handed over the appearance, at
any rate, of victory, to the very forces that some well-considered
thoroughly well-examined socialist feels to be probably the greatest
enemy ... If the Government had fought their policy out, we would
have respected it. It just suddenly doubled up ... The consequence
has been to increase the power and the prestige of those who do not
believe in political action. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Labour&#8217;s objection to Red Friday went beyond the fear of
strikes. Government aid for wages was &#8216;madness&#8217; and &#8216;sheer
waste&#8217;. MacDonald wrote: &#8216;To think of a subsidy as a means of
taking from the rich something they ought never to have in order to
give it to the workmen who ought to have had it all the time, is not
a policy that will bear examination.&#8217; <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
<a href="#na" name="fa">[1*]</a></p>

<p>As the General Strike approached, the gap between the Labour Party
and the TUC narrowed, for the fundamental similarity of their
interests became apparent. On 30 April 1926, with full government
approval, the miners were locked out. At the Conference of Union
Executives to launch the General Strike, MacDonald made a &#8216;hypnotic&#8217;
speech <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>: &#8216;we will be by the miners&#8217;
side, because it is a just side, an honourable side. It is the life
of the toiling masses that we have been striving for, not to make
enemies of society, but to make the very best friends that society
has.&#8217; <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p>MacDonald&#8217;s speech could never have been made by a Tory or
Liberal. His identification with the working class, even the demand
for &#8216;the toiling masses&#8217; to be accepted into the bosom of society
rather than remaining outcasts, embodied aspirations common to
millions of workers. This aspect must not be forgotten. But what was
special about the General Strike was that it revealed just how
incompatible workers&#8217; aspirations and capitalist society really
were. When concern for miners had to be weighed against the need &#8216;not
to make enemies of society&#8217; it was obvious which would be the
loser. A sell-out was inevitable.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Solidarity, treachery and irrelevance</h4>

<p class="fst">The story of the nine-day General Strike and its tragic betrayal
by the TUC has been told elsewhere. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>
What concerns us here is the Labour Party&#8217;s role. This had three
totally different aspects. Firstly, the mass of trade unionists
affiliated to Labour gave a show of solidarity without equal. There
were more out the day after the strike was called off than before.
Secondly, the Labour Party itself did absolutely nothing to direct
them forward. <em>No-one struck as a Labour Party member, only as a
trade unionist.</em> The claim of Sidney Webb that heads this chapter
&#8211; &#8216;You must understand that the Labour Party and its
Parliamentary leaders or representatives <em>had nothing to do with
it</em>&#8217; &#8211; was deadly accurate. The outstanding support the miners
received was <em>in spite</em> of the whole thrust of Labour&#8217;s
policy. Any local assistance the strike received from Labour was
independent of the national organisation.</p>

<p>The third aspect of Labour&#8217;s role was that while the
parliamentary leaders did nothing to advance the strike, they were
tremendously active in selling it out. Baldwin tried to embarrass
MacDonald by quoting his earlier anti-strike speeches. He misjudged
his man. MacDonald answered:</p>

<p class="quoteb">If I have a grievance against the Prime Minister for
having read out a statement of mine, it is that he selected a very
poor condemnation. I have gone far more into detail than that ...
With the discussion of general strikes and Bolshevism and all that
kind of thing, I have nothing to do at all. I respect the
Constitution. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Sometimes the Labour leaders went too far even for the TUC.</p>

<p>In the middle of the strike MacDonald and Thomas were reported as
being &#8216;in hourly conference ... regarding a settlement&#8217;, and the
TUC was forced categorically to deny this. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p>Such open activity was nothing compared to the frenetic efforts in
secret. When the strike began, wrote Sidney Webb:</p>

<p class="quoteb">we had all to make the best of it, and we started,
individually, straight away to contrive some way of resuming
negotiations ... MacDonald and Henderson (with Thomas) ... have been
all the week almost continuously at work, from early morn to past
midnight, tying one proposal after another, wrestling with stupidity,
and obstinacy and jealously, seeking fresh avenues of negotiation and
bringing to bear all possible influences. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">By &#8216;stupidity, obstinacy and jealousy&#8217; Webb meant the miners
fighting for survival.</p>

<p>This hyper-activity contrasted strangely with the party&#8217;s
national executive, which Beatrice Webb called &#8216;the Cabinet of the
British Labour Movement&#8217;. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a> The
minutes noted the mining crisis no earlier than 28 April when local
parties wrote in asking for guidance. The executive&#8217;s reply was
that &#8216;propaganda literature had been published.&#8217; During the
strike itself, there is no evidence of executive activity or even
that it met. Thus <em>the very first mention</em> the minutes make of
the General Strike is <em>3 June 1926</em> when the finance and general
purposes sub-committee remarked: &#8216;The effect of the General Strike
upon the finances of the unions appeared to be such as would
adversely affect the income arising from the current affiliation fees.&#8217;</p>

<p>On 21 June the organisation sub-committee remitted that a joint
TUC/Labour Propaganda Committee had organised public meetings on 8
and 9 May. At last on 23 June, just five weeks late, the executive
itself considered this momentous event, though much against its will.
With trade unionism in tatters after the TUC&#8217;s treachery it was
assailed by the demand for &#8216;the National Labour Party [to give] a
definite lead in dissipating the feeling of distrust and despair.&#8217;
The executive&#8217;s helpful conclusion? &#8216;That a reply be sent
explaining the propaganda work in which the Party has been and is
engaged; and stating that the Trade Union Congress are the custodians
of the industrial side of the matter.&#8217;</p>

<p>Paton of the ILP witnessed these events: &#8216;the gigantic machine
of the Labour Party, with its organisation in every constituency in
the country [was] in the house adjoining that of the General Council
in Eccleston Square. On the first day [of the General Strike] the
entire machine, with its perfectly functioning staff was placed at
the disposal of the General Council; apparently they&#8217;d as little
use for this machine as for ours.&#8217; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p>Further down the ladder of organisation the picture is repeated.
The party&#8217;s best-organised section was the London Labour Party led
by Herbert Morrison. According to its 1926 Report, its main
contribution was to put &#8216;two members of our clerical staff, at the
General Council&#8217;s disposal. But this was not all. &#8216;Particulars of
Choral, Dramatic and Orchestral organisations ... were communicated&#8217;
to the TUC. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a> Yet more followed!
Morrison reorganised the TUC courier system, but &#8216;the first job
that my revised despatch service had to discharge was to deliver the
notice terminating the General Strike.&#8217; <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p>What of the ILP, &#8216;easily the most efficient and widespread
socialist organisation in Great Britain&#8217;? <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a>
Wheatley, at least, had recognised that the bureaucracy would
probably sell-out. After Red Friday he caused a mild sensation with
an article which said &#8216;Prepare for the great struggle nine months
hence ... Refuse to enter Coolieland ... The workers&#8217; army of
defence can be increased by one million a month. A Labour army of 10
million can preserve industrial peace. Now to the recruitment
office.&#8217; <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a> What a incredible
combination&#8211;racism, class war rhetoric and a ten million strong
workers&#8217; army devoted to ... industrial peace. This was centrist
extravaganza that confused even Wheatley&#8217;s friends. The idea was
not repeated. Instead the ILP retreated back into its ivory tower of
<em>Socialism in Our Time</em>&#8217;. <a href="#nb" name="fb">[2*]</a></p>

<p>The day the miners were locked out the ILP re-awoke. Its newspaper
warned workers to watch the TUC carefully. But did the ILP go beyond
the abstentionism of the labour Party national executive? Not in the
least. In the last <strong>Labour Leader</strong> before strike Maxton wrote:
&#8216;It is not part of the duty of those outside the miners&#8217; ranks to
attempt to make their decision for them ... The duties of the Labour
movement been when the miners have made their decision.&#8217; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a>
In other words, Maxton was saying that socialist politics have
nothing to do with leading actual workers&#8217; struggles since they are
really directed at winning seats in parliament.</p>

<p>Paton, the ILP&#8217;s organising secretary, recounts what happened
during the strike:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I wrote at once to the General Council, putting at their
disposal the entire resources of the ILP, lock, stock and barrel, for
the duration of the strike ... I returned to my office to make
feverish preparations for the call that must soon come ... we were
certain we&#8217;d an invaluable contribution to make in a struggle of
this magnitude ... We transported mattresses and blankets to the
office where we&#8217;d decided to camp for the duration of the strike
and await the call to action with confidence. A week later we were
still waiting. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Labour &#8211; the alibi for a sell-out</h4>

<p class="fst">The TUC had been pushed unwillingly into a strike and was
determined to head it off as soon as possible. Again, as in 1919,
<em>reformist politics were the chief ingredient of bureaucratic
sellout</em>. General Strike, like any other war, could only be won if
the enemy stronghold was attacked. That stronghold was the state. The
bureaucracy was terrified by this prospect and used the existence of
the Labour Party as an excuse to keep politics out of the strike.</p>

<p>MacDonald did not overstate the case when he said: &#8216;Never for a
single moment, never for a solitary hour, did the men responsible for
the strike toy or play with political issues ... I never heard a
single member of the Trade Union Congress Committee whisper an idea,
give a piece of advice, suggest a move or policy that was aimed at a
political issue.&#8217; <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a> Four of the
seven issues of the General Council&#8217;s paper, <strong>British Worker</strong>,
carried an identical declaration that the strike did</p>

<p class="quoteb">not challenge the Constitution. It is not seeking to
substitute unconstitutional government. Nor is it desirous of
undermining our parliamentary institutions. The sole aim of the
council is to secure for the miners a decent standard of life. The
council is engaged in an industrial dispute. In any settlement the
only issue to be decided will be an industrial issue, not political
and constitutional. There is no constitutional crisis. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Now any organisation that was even remotely &#8216;a party of the
working class&#8217; would not have sat in its offices waiting official
sanction but would have been drawn in inexorably, debating, arguing,
suggesting lines of action and attempting to provide a socialist lead
to the rank and file. The fact that <em>even the best Labour activists
abstained politically</em> was extremely significant. Labour&#8217;s
national organisation (the ILP included) had precisely nothing to say
to the working class. What earthly use is the best way to wheedle
votes or make telling points at prime minister&#8217;s question time when
the destiny of the working class is at stake? As we have written elsewhere:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Labour Party is purely electoral. Hence it relates to
its supporters as a multitude of individuals. The trade union
bureaucracy must relate to groups of workers as collectives. With
this separation of politics and economics, the Labour Party
leadership is always an outsider to the industrial struggle. In
contrast to this, the trade union bureaucracy can never completely
avoid heading the industrial struggle, even if only in order to
restrain it. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Electoralism denies even the best Labour activists any independent
role. It is the secret of their irrelevance whenever real class
struggle breaks out.</p>

<p>Even the best reformists see a Chinese Wall separating struggle at
the point of production from the question of state power. This
attitude has a material basis. Under &#8216;normal&#8217; capitalist
conditions there <em>does</em> seem to be a division between politics
and economics. Struggles at the point of production rarely generalise
to the point where the state is seen to be involved politically.
Conversely &#8216;high politics&#8217; appears to have little relation to
day-to-day events in the workplace. This separation is vital to the
preservation of the bourgeois democratic <em>status quo</em>. Being
thoroughly adapted to capitalist conditions, <em>Labour strives to
perpetuate the separation of politics and economics, even when a
revolutionary opportunity is to hand</em>. It leaves collective action
to the unions (or more usually, to the union bureaucracy).</p>

<p>However, to win socialism the working class must overcome the
division between politics and economics, using its industrial power
as the base for building its <em>political</em> domination. This takes
the form of the workers&#8217; state which grows from <em>soviets</em> or
workers&#8217; councils of factory and office delegates. The working
class <em>is</em> capable of this leap. Workers can make sense of their
own experience and draw revolutionary conclusions, but for this to
happen a party committed to workers&#8217; power must gain leadership.</p>
<p>The only political organisation to come near to advancing the
General Strike was the Communist Party. Alas it was already distorted
by Stalinism, as shown by its slogan &#8216;All Power to the General
Council&#8217;, the very body which killed the strike. But even while
carrying this awful burden, the Communist Party&#8217;s 6,000 members
contributed infinitely more than the ILP or Labour Party. <em>All</em>
the forward initiatives &#8211; Councils of Action, Workers&#8217; Defence
Corps and the movements for the control of food &#8211; had already been
argued for and were now set up by activists in and around the
Communist Party. With a different leadership these might have been a
basis from which to challenge the sell-out. The Communist Party
played a prominent role in running the strike and picketing. Of the
5,000 arrested during the strike, fully 1,200 were Communist Party
members. A Communist striker was 200 times more likely to be arrested
than a Labour one.</p>

<p>The contrast between Labour&#8217;s immense forces and the tiny
Communist Party makes nonsense of the frequent claim that
revolutionaries are irrelevant to the working-class movement while
Labour is somehow relevant. When the class is really <em>in motion</em>
the Labour Party has nothing to offer but sabotage. Only in periods
of relative passivity can it appear that the make-believe world of
parliamentary socialism embodies the working-class movement.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The post-mortem</h4>

<p class="fst">On 12 May the TUC unconditionally surrendered. At least the union
leaders showed some contrition for their scandalous behaviour or
pretended the outcome was not a total disaster; across the space of
fifty years we can almost hear the Labour leaders gleefully rubbing
their hands at the defeat.</p>

<p>The Webbs considered the strike to be</p>

<p class="quoteb">a monstrous irrelevance ... the noxious futility of this
mild edition of the &#8216;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8217; will be
apparent to everyone ... The failure of the General Strike of 1926
will be one of the most significant landmarks in the history of the
British working class [because it is] the death gasp of that
pernicious doctrine of &#8216;workers&#8217; control&#8217;. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Best of all for them was that</p>

<p class="quoteb">the only organisation that comes out the stronger for
this disaster is the Parliamentary Labour Party &#8211; for the simple
reason that the ... strike as a weapon has been discredited. Indeed
the agony of the Miners&#8217; Federation <em>might</em> mean a Labour
government after the General Election of 1928.&#8217; <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Ramsey MacDonald considered the strike to be &#8216;one of the most
lamentable adventures in crowd self-leadership of our labour
history.&#8217; <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> but its defeat made it
&#8216;a glowing point in the history of British Labour.&#8217; <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p>Snowden agreed: &#8216;the experiment provided lessons of the greatest
value to Trade Unionism ... I was not sorry that this experiment had
been tried. The Trade Unions needed a lesson of the futility and
foolishness of such a trial of strength.&#8217; <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>

<p>Thomas extracted the most enjoyment from this crushing blow. He
revelled in the strike-breaking activities:</p>

<p class="quoteb">When the strike came ... the working-class had to take
back the bitter things they had said about the pampered upper classes
... These fellows &#8211; clerks, dandies, even &#8211; tackled any sort of
job; they drove trains, piloted motor buses, and even unloaded ships
in harbour. That is how England tackled her first General Strike.&#8217; <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">And the lesson? &#8216;The only real and lasting remedy against social
injustice is the ballot box.&#8217; <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a></p>

<p>This joyous dancing on the grave of the workers&#8217; movement was
well-founded. Shopfloor confidence was in ruins. Between 1927 and
1929 &#8216;the number of recorded strikes and the number of working days
lost through strikes fell to the lowest figures since systematic
recording had begun nearly 40 years earlier.&#8217; <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p>MacDonald and company were not jubilant just because revolution
was prevented; trade union action was also discredited. There is a
fundamental difference between reforms won from below and those
granted from above. The former strengthen class organisation and this
creates the possibility of future advance. Those from above encourage
passivity, tend to integrate the workers into the system, and so may
hold back the struggle for socialism. The Labour Party stands for
change <em>from above</em> and requires a tame workers&#8217; movement that
patiently awaits parliamentary action. Reforms must come from this
source, or they should not come at all. Thus the humiliation of the
TUC (although not its destruction) was a major boost for the Labour leaders.</p>

<p>The TUC was indeed brought to heel. Alongside the Mond-Turner
talks about employer/union collaboration, it was ready to substitute
electoralism for collective action. At its Bournemouth Congress the
TUC president, Arthur Pugh, thanked Labour for pointing out the
reformist alternative to revolution: &#8216;The supreme lesson of the
national strike is the clear evidence it adduced as showing that the
Trade Union Movement retains belief in the essential rightness of
democratic methods ... We have had a Labour Government, the symbol of
our victory.&#8217; <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a></p>

<p>The following year that former left-winger George Hicks sang a new
tune at the TUC: I say that it is now an imperative duty to use every
atom of organised strength we possess, and every scrap of time and
energy for the return of the Labour Government at the next General
Election.&#8217; <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a> The <strong>Daily Herald</strong>,
run by the official leaderships of the Labour Party and the TUC, led
the chorus. Two weeks after the sell-out its editorial declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">When we said the gains of the nine unforgettable days
were far larger than the losses we were asked by a number of
correspondents what these gains were. [The by-election victory at]
Hammersmith is one of them. There will be many more. Gone is the
notion, sedulously put about by Communist organs, that the ranks of
Labour are split, that there is a feeling of &#8216;betrayal&#8217;, that the
strike left workers bewildered and resentful.</p>

<p class="quote">We see now that the Strike and the battle for the Miners
... has brought into the movement large numbers who never voted
Labour before. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a></p>

<p class="fst">If there had been no General Strike, the smashing of the miners &#8211;
one quarter of all trade unionists &#8211; might have so devastated the
class that Labour itself would have suffered. But the magnificent
display of solidarity sent a rush of new blood into the workers&#8217;
movement. The terrible defeat that followed allowed the Labour Party
to feed on this. The vampire needs living victims, and these victims
grow to love their predator. Workers did not feel strong enough to
fight independently but were sufficiently stirred up after the defeat
to hope MacDonald would fight for them.</p>

<p>So <em>the most important effect of the Strike was to establish the
absolute dominance of electoralist strategy</em> right across the
workers&#8217; movement. <a href="#nc" name="fc">[3*]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">A horrific postscript</h4>

<p class="fst">The most disgraceful episode of 1926 was Labour&#8217;s treatment of
the miners, who contributed more financially and electorally to the
party than any section of the labour movement. Whatever might be the
failings of the Communists or ILP during the General Strike, they did
their best to support the miners in their lone fight after 13 May.
The Labour Party blocked their way. Appeals by the Communists for an
embargo on the movement of coal fell on deaf ears, with even the ILP
objecting. Then when the ILP suggested levying Labour Party members
to provide funds for the locked-out miners and their families, the
motion was carved out of the 1926 Labour Party Conference agenda at
Margate. Kirkwood pleaded with the delegates: &#8216;a levy should be
made on all the organisations of the Labour Party. Was that too much
to ask? ... Why not give an actual demonstration that they were in
earnest?&#8217; <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>

<p>There were sound reasons why Labour supplemented treachery with
callousness. The &#8216;agony of the miners&#8217; was a vote winner; a
victory for strikers was a threat. So Labour backed the TUC when it
refused £300,000 collected by Russian trade unionists for the
miners. Morrison considered this &#8216;about the only thing he could
find to praise the unions for.&#8217; <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a>
MacDonald lauded the Margate TUC&#8217;s refusal to lift a finger for the
miners: &#8216;The proper and helpful thing to do was done. The
Conference declared emphatically that the solution was political.&#8217; <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s delay in providing the miners with <em>any</em> form of
assistance was scandalous. The timing of events was as follows. On 28
September, <em>four months after the lockout began</em>, the
Parliamentary Labour Party suggested a party whip-round might be
appropriate. On 13 October 1926 the national executive got around to
agreeing. Alas, things went badly &#8216;owing to the fact that the
campaign was inaugurated in the closing stages of the Municipal
Contests.&#8217; So it was that in the fifth month of the lock-out it
managed some &#8216;social meetings&#8217; in which &#8216;the desired
resolutions were passed.&#8217; <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p>The last word should go to the Webbs. As MP for Seaham, County
Durham, Sidney owed his parliamentary salary to the votes of miners
and their families. But he was most displeased to have to make a
donation to the locked out miners! What terrible heart-searching he
and his wife suffered over that £10. Beatrice wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Ought we or ought we not to give, and ask others to give,
to the fund for the miners&#8217; wives and children? Neither Sidney nor
I would have given a penny to it if no one would have been the wiser.
I gave my name to the Committee and sent a cheque for £10 simply
because I conformed to the loudly expressed opinion of the world of
labour &#8211; with which I secretly disagreed. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p class="fst">How sickening!</p>

<p>A capitalist workers&#8217; party is under stress in two directions.
There is the tension between left and right. In the 1920s the chief
protagonists were on the one hand the ILP and TUC lefts and on the
other MacDonald and the TUC right. But there is also a division
between the working class and the leadership. The General Strike
showed that the latter is the more fundamental. During the nine days
a massive split opened between the reformist organisations and union
bureaucracy on the one hand, and the rank and file on the other. The
inability of the revolutionary left to challenge the labour
bureaucracy ensured that it was MacDonald who triumphed.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The fruits of defeat: The anti-communist witch-hunt</h4>

<p class="fst">Witch-hunts date from Labour&#8217;s earliest days. They began when
the party was officially just two years old with Hardie attacking
Grayson&#8217;s supporters thus: &#8216;In almost every branch there is this
snarling disruptive element. You have got to fight it down and fight
it out.&#8217; <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p>Given Labour&#8217;s consistent right-wing leadership there can be
little doubt it has relished the idea of banishing its opponents
permanently. But the leadership&#8217;s actions are limited. Public
infighting can be electorally damaging and the process of elimination
is not simple. Finally, the very nature of the Labour Party
encourages diversity. The affiliated trade unions, for example,
recruit around economic questions, not shared political ideas.
Moreover, electoralism &#8211; which requires votes rather than a
definite political commitment &#8211; means that Labour will recruit
racists, multi-millionaires or red revolutionaries so long as each is
worth an extra ballot paper. This is the basis of the very real claim
that Labour is &#8216;a broad church&#8217;.</p>

<p>So while witch-hunts extend throughout Labour&#8217;s history, they
are not a constant feature and only occur in specific circumstances.
They have <em>not</em> been launched when the leadership feared losing
control to the left. When the class is on the offensive the leaders
don left clothing themselves to preserve their position. The action
of arch-right-wingers Arthur Henderson and Sidney Webb in proposing
Clause Four was an example. So expulsions are not a sign of
right-wing weakness or collapse, but of its <em>strength</em>. They are
associated with a passive or retreating workers&#8217; movement.</p>

<p>This has a number of effects. Firstly, as the political climate
shifts to the right, a vocal left-wing is seen as an electoral
liability. At the same time a <em>downturn in workers&#8217; confidence
leaves a wide gap between the majority and the advanced section</em>
of the working class, who are then easily isolated and attacked.</p>

<p>This pattern was confirmed by the hounding of the Communist Party
in the 1920s, Labour&#8217;s most important, vicious and thorough
witch-hunt. The Labour leadership had been keen to destroy
revolutionary influence from the October 1917 revolution onwards. In
the &#8216;direct action&#8217; period, however, there had been little that
the leaders could do in terms of witch-hunts.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The first phase</h4>

<p class="fst">The tide turned after Black Friday, 15 April 1921. The 1922 Labour
Party Conference in Edinburgh passed a resolution by two to one
stating that &#8216;No person shall be eligible as a delegate who
supports candidates other than such as have been endorsed by the
Labour Party.&#8217; <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a> This was directed
at the Communists who, as revolutionaries, reserved the right to
stand separately, and if need be, in opposition to reformists.</p>

<p>However the resolution proved inoperable. Communists were not only
returned as delegates, they were selected to run for parliament by
local parties without hiding either their principles or the feet that
they belonged to a separate organisation. For example Walton Newbold,
the Communist who stood for parliament with Labour sponsorship in
1922, had written to the local party in these terms:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I begged them to realize what they were doing and to
understand that I would only fight as a Bolshevik, and if they did
not want a Bolshevik they should choose someone else ... They chose
me with their eyes open-prised wide open. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A year after the resolution was passed Henderson had to admit that
&#8216;the new rule was somewhat difficult to administer&#8217; and withdrew
it. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p>The first attack failed for two reasons &#8211; one political, the
other technical. The spirit that brought Britain to the brink of
revolution in 1919 was not dead. It had been dampened down in 1921,
but activists were still not prepared to sacrifice the Communists,
and the fighting policies they stood for, to please the right wing.</p>

<p>The second problem flowed from the unusual structure of Labour
itself. At <em>national level</em> the PLP had tremendous power because
of the reformist idea that change comes through parliament. At
conference the trade union bureaucracy exercised a decisive influence
through its block votes. Together the Labour leaders and the
officials could ram through anything they jointly agreed.</p>

<p>However this picture of right-wing domination at the centre was
not mirrored <em>at the base</em>. Indeed the structure worked in the
opposite direction. The rank and file of the unions and
constituencies elected delegates to local Labour Parties
independently of party HQ and conference. This gave the left a local
basis from which to resist the centre. They found it possible to
ignore orders from national bodies.</p>

<p>This local situation might encourage, a belief in the possibility
of transforming the whole party, but it was pure illusion. <em>The
very structure that allowed for a degree of local autonomy meant it
was impossible for the rank and file to control the leadership.</em></p>

<p>Revolutionaries are sometimes criticised for their adherence to
&#8216;democratic centralism&#8217; which demands discipline in action
combined with full discussion amongst an informed membership. The
apparent freedom of opinion in the Labour Party is merely a disguise
for the untrammelled power of the centre.</p>

<p>The 1923 general election and first Labour government made the
leadership hanker after respectability even more. Now Labour was in
the political big league. What could be tolerated in a party striving
for entry to the corridors of power was unacceptable once access was granted.</p>

<p>Pressure to renew the witch-hunt developed after the May 1924
Kelvingrove by-election in which a Communist standing under Labour
auspices lost by 1,000 votes. The Labour executive put up with
MacDonald breaking election pledges and threatening to smash strikes
with troops, but losing a seat was unpardonable. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a>
An inquiry into Communist activities was set up and reported that the
chief obstacle to destroying their influence was their strength in
the unions.</p>

<p>The Communist Party did not see socialism coming through
parliament but by the activity of the working class itself. So it
concentrated its efforts in industry, where it established its
credibility as a fighting organisation. As the inquiry complained:
&#8216;It is doubtful whether the unions are prepared to enforce a ruling
that individual Communists shall not be eligible to serve as
delegates to local Labour Parties.&#8217; <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a></p>

<p>When the government fell in 1924 the right-wing wanted scapegoats,
and who better than the Communists? Was it not Labour&#8217;s efforts to
prove its hatred of subversion that had led to the bungled
prosecution of a Communist newspaper and forced an early election?
And the &#8216;Zinoviev letter&#8217; added a further excuse. <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>

<p>The 1924 party conference, held just before polling, was keen to
show voters that Labour hated Communism. MacDonald set the tone,
declaring: &#8216;We have as much to do with Bolshevism as the man in the
moon &#8211; except that we regard it as an enemy ... We have not a
thousandth-millionth part of sympathy with the Bolshevik point of
view.&#8217; <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a> Morrison said that &#8216;if
there was any fundamental difference&#8217; between the Communist Party
&#8216;and the Fascist army of Signor Mussolini he would like to know
what it was.&#8217; <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a> The conference was
convinced. Affiliation received its lowest vote yet and passed a
resolution that Communists could not be candidates for local or
national government. Even individual membership was proscribed.</p>

<p>Electoral defeat only served to whet the leaders&#8217; appetite for
more blood. Clynes was sure that Labour would not win power &#8216;until
the public mind is purged of the mistaken impression that the party
entertains a measure of approval with Communist objects and policy.&#8217;
But if the Communists were ditched &#8216;we may fairly hope to change
the one third of the sixteen million who have just voted into the two
thirds or more required.&#8217; <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a>
MacDonald said: &#8216;I firmly believe the attitude of the Labour Party
in turning down the Communist proposals ... will bring the party
hundreds of thousands of votes.&#8217; <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a></p>

<p>The situation inside the Labour Party was clearly ripe for a
witch-hunt; but the mood of the movement outside was not.</p>

<p>Just two months after the crushing conference majorities for a
witch-hunt, a national executive sub-committee on Communist activity
ruefully admitted defeat. No action could be taken. The reasons for
failure had long been understood. As one executive member put it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I fail to see how any member of a Trade Union, who is put
forward by his TU, can be disallowed, so long as he pays for
political efforts as laid down in his particular society rules. The
mere fact that he agreed to pay for Labour representation entitles
him to full opportunity to exercise the right he pays for in his TU
contribution. The fact that an individual is a Communist, who does
so, is of no more consideration than if he were a Spiritualist. <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The 1925 Labour Conference in Liverpool tried a new tack. It
pleaded with the unions to be &#8216;consistent&#8217; and &#8216;appeal&#8217; for
branches to &#8216;refrain&#8217; from selecting Communist delegates. <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a>
Once more the power of the block vote gave these proposals a massive
majority &#8211; 2,870,000 to 321,000. But still the localities resisted.
Regular reports of defiant branches reached the executive.
Disaffiliation became the only alternative, but until May 1926 only
three local parties had been dealt with.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The final battle begins</h4>

<p class="fst">The right&#8217;s efforts had been baulked for four years, but the
General Strike finally cleared the way for them. The very executive
meeting after the strike expelled Springburn Labour Party and the
next added fully five more. <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a> By the
end of 1926 13 out of an eventual total of 27 labour Parties had been
dissolved. An indication of the executive&#8217;s double standard was its
treatment of G.A. Spencer, the Nottinghamshire Labour MP and leader
of the scab miners&#8217; union. Despite calls for him to be disciplined
for organising scabbing, the executive refused, claiming &#8216;this is
primarily a matter for the Miners&#8217; Federation&#8217;. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a>
No such diplomatic niceties were reserved for the Communists.</p>
<p>By this time the Communist Party had decided to promote the Left
Wing Movement. As we have seen, this was a mistake. Nevertheless the
LWM did not trim its sails to stay inside the party, because, unlike
the Labour and trade union lefts, it was based on an independent
political organisation with roots in the collective organisation of
workers. The LWM&#8217;s immediate response to the witch-hunt was &#8216;we
will fight it without mercy.&#8217; <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>

<p>J.J. Vaughan, chairman of the LWM, put its priorities in this way:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We have been asked by several people why we do not
propagate our ideas inside the Labour Party without organising a Left
Wing Movement on a national scale which carries on a constant
struggle ... The Left Wing would easily be crashed and with it the
spread of working-class ideas in the Labour Movement if the Left Wing
did not organise and prepare to fight for its point of view. <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The first outbreak of hand-to-hand fighting was in Manchester,
where the Borough Labour Party announced it would eject Communist
Party members who acted as delegates to Labour Party bodies. In
response the Trades Council ostentatiously picked two Communists as
its representatives. NUR members instructed their Communist delegate
to &#8216;sit tight and refuse to leave the meeting.&#8217; The engineers
withdrew their non-Communist delegate solely in order to send a
Communist Party member. <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a></p>

<p>Similar tactics were repeated all over the country. Expelled
Communists were re-elected to responsible positions, dozens of Labour
Parties stood in open defiance and were disaffiliated. The official
record mentions a total of 27 <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a>, but
this covers only borough and divisional parties which were dealt with
by party headquarters. Countless individuals, wards and affiliated
organisations were involved in the fight.</p>

<p>In October 1926 came the Margate conference. Discussion was
stitched up by excluding local Labour Parties which had put forward
awkward resolutions. Eleven Communist Party members were either
banned from attending or &#8216;discovered&#8217; and chucked out. Only two
Communists, both union representatives, survived the purge. <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a>
1927 raised the struggle to a new intensity.</p>

<p>Dissolved local parties fought a rearguard action to the point of
running candidates against &#8216;official Labour&#8217;. In the 1928
municipal elections the Bethnal Green rebel polled twice as many
votes as his official rival, and across London they received one
third. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a></p>

<p>But in reality the war was almost over. Labour determined to smash
the last pockets of resistance at its 1928 conference. This was an
extraordinary affair. All resolutions and amendments from branches
were ignored. The executive alone could present items for discussion.
Even emergency motions could only be brought by the executive. A
&#8216;Loyalty Clause&#8217; was introduced barring association with
Communists and excluded them from attending meetings or appearing on
the same platform as Labour Party members. At the end of the year the
tally of disaffiliations stood at 24. The Third Left Wing Conference
heard its chairperson declare that &#8216;from 10 percent to 15 per cent
of the entire movement ... has been sacrificed.&#8217; <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a></p>

<p>The LWM closed down in March 1929. It has been wrongly argued that
the Communist Party threw away great opportunities to convert Labour
to Communism. Of course, the idea of a Left Wing Movement did not
accord with its new line that Labour was &#8216;social fascist&#8217;, but by
the time this was adopted the movement was already in ruins. It had
fought as hard as possible, but in post 1926 conditions the
witch-hunt was unstoppable.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The constitutional left</h4>

<p class="fst">One feature of the witch-hunt was the position of those on the
Labour left who disliked the expulsion of the Communists but refused
to fight it as the LWM had done. The Clydesiders said little, apart
from even-handedly rejecting MacDonald&#8217;s gradualism and the
Communist Party&#8217;s &#8216;catastrophic&#8217; revolutionism. Maxton &#8216;stood
for toleration of both left and right wings&#8217;, adding he would do
nothing which &#8216;would lead to his own expulsion.&#8217; <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a>
<strong>Forward</strong> carried headlines such as &#8216;Communists, biggest asset
of Capitalists&#8217;. <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a></p>

<p>The most prominent figure to deal with the question in detail was
Lansbury. He began by stoutly denouncing anti-Communist measures. But
when the witch-hunt gathered pace Lansbury found he could no longer
have it both ways; either he backed the party or he backed socialist
policies. The choice was quickly made. In December 1925 he wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">One or two Labour Parties have defied the
[anti-Communist] resolutions and have been faced with the
consequences. The official Headquarters did its duty in carrying out
the official policy. The result is: the dissidents find their local
party faced with disaffiliation and expulsion ... If they fight on,
they know they must face splitting the Party. <em>They and their
instigators are the wreckers of the movement.</em> It is hard saying,
but true. <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a></p>

<p class="fst">How dare the Communist Party defend itself!</p>

<p>Perhaps Lansbury hoped, by keeping his head down, to fight another
day. Nothing could have been more wrong. <em>The smashing of the
Communists meant the gagging of everyone else.</em></p>

<p>The contrast between the Communist Party and the constitutional
left was significant. When a period of working-class defeat leads to
a rightward drift, and Labour moves with it, only an organisation
which <em>puts socialism above the electoral game</em> and builds its
own base <em>independent of the Labour machine</em> can resist the
pressure to conform.</p>
