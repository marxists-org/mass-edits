<h1>14. The Labour Party<br/>
under the Heath Government</h1>

<br/>
<h4>The industrial scene</h4>

<p class="fst">UNION MILITANCY had mushroomed in face of the economic
difficulties and the failures of the Wilson government. It was given
further impetus by the policies of the new Tory government led by
Edward Heath. Legislation on industrial relations, and a
determination to control public sector wages produced a series of
strike explosions.</p>

<p>An Industrial Relations Bill was introduced in December 1970 which
had affinities with <strong>In Place of Strife</strong>. Again there was to be
a register of unions, exclusion from which would mean the loss of
legal immunities, and a cooling-off period (in this case sixty days).
Secret ballots reappeared, along with an industrial court &#8211; the
National Industrial Relations Court (NIRC). The closed shop was in be
banned and collective agreements would be legally binding unless they
included a written statement to the contrary.</p>

<p>The union leadership reacted far more sharply against the Tories.
The TUC held a series of national, regional and local meetings, a
rally in the Albert Hall and many open air demonstrations, including
a 140,000-strong march on 21 February 1971. The TUC called on the
unions not to register under the Act, and practically all sizeable
unions responded. All unions employed the draft clause suggested by
the TUC for collective agreements, stating: &#8216;This is not a legally
enforceable agreement.&#8217;</p>

<p>However, when Labour is out of office, union bureaucrats do not
change their spots entirely. The TUC still rejected industrial
action. In spite of this, one-day protest strikes did take place,
organised by the rank and file, involving 600,000 workers on 8
December 1970, 180,000 on 12 January 1971 and about 1,250,000 on both
1 March and 18 March 1971.</p>

<p>One high point in workers&#8217; struggle was over sackings at Upper
Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS). On the afternoon of 24 June 1971 more than
100,000 workers in Glasgow stopped work. Half of them demonstrated
through the city. This was the largest Clydeside protest
demonstration since the General Strike. A month later John Davies,
the secretary for industry, announced that employment in the UCS
yards would be cut from 8,500 to 2,500. Next day the workers of UCS
took control of the four yards.</p>

<p>On 10 August a meeting of more than 1,200 shop stewards from all
over Scotland and the north of England unanimously endorsed the plan
for a work-in, and appealed for financial support for the workers of
UCS. On 18 August, some 200,000 Scottish workers downed tools, and
about 80,000 of them went on a demonstration. The shock to the
government was immense. David McNee, head of Strathclyde police,
phoned Downing Street and made it clear he would not take
responsibility for civil order unless the government kept UCS open.
Heath obliged by making a U-turn.</p>

<p>In July 1972 five London dockers were imprisoned in Pentonville
for breaking the industrial relations law. All 44,000 dockers struck
unofficially. Fleet Street followed suit and a number of engineering
workers also came out. It seemed even the union bureaucracy might
lose control unless it acted. On 26 July the General Council called a
one-day strike for 31 July. The government took fright, and on the
very day the General Council issued the call, the House of Lords took
the dramatic step of altering the law to get Heath off the hook. The
men were freed immediately; the TUC dropped the call for strike.</p>

<p>There were more than 200 occupations of shipyards, factories,
offices and workshops between 1972 and 1974. Workers also won
important battles on the wages front. The most significant were the
magnificent miners&#8217; strikes of 1972 and 1974.</p>

<p>The first of these involved a great deal of rank and file activity
and industrial solidarity which culminated in the &#8216;battle of
Saltley gates&#8217;. Thousands of miners, assisted by some 20,000
striking engineers, shut a strategic Midlands coke depot and thereby
insured the success of the strike. The second miners&#8217; strike,
during the winter of 1973-4, though more passive than its
predecessor, finally precipitated the downfall of the Tories and
forced the general election which returned Labour to office.</p>

<p>The total of strike days reached 10,980,000 in 1970 and I
1,551,000 in 1971, climbing to 23,909,000 in 1972 &#8211; the highest
figures since the 1920s. The average number of strike days in 1945&#8211;54
had been 2,073,000, in 1955&#8211;64 3,889,000, and 1965&#8211;9 1,951,000.</p>

<p>The political strike reappeared in Britain for the first time in
over half a century. As political strikes are not officially counted,
one has to rely on estimates for their size. One estimate suggests
that official and unofficial strikes against the Industrial Relations
Act in 1970&#8211;71 involved twice as many workers as the entire year&#8217;s
industrial disputes. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p>Circumstances had forced both Labour and Tory governments in
conduct a general attack on the workers on behalf of the ruling lass.
But government intervention &#8211; incomes policy, industrial relations
legislation, pressure towards productivity deals &#8211; forced workers
to generalise their own struggles too. Ingrained sectionalism began
to be overcome. In the words of Colin Crouch:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In part it has been the very reforms designed to
re-institutionalise local action &#8211; incomes policy, reforms to
bargaining structures and payment systems, productivity bargaining,
and industrial relations reform &#8211; which have broken the local
isolation of militant action and given it wider repercussions both
economically and politically. The growth of shop-floor militancy
initially produced a government response which forced industrial
relations to become intensely politicised. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One labour historian, Royden Harrison, called the struggle during
Heath&#8217;s government</p>

<p class="quoteb">the most extraordinary triumph of trade unionism in its
long conflict with government ... The Labour Unrest of 1970&#8211;74 was
far more massive and incomparably more successful than its
predecessor of 1910 to 1914. Millions of workers became involved ...
Some of them began to exhibit an ominous concern with the conditions
of <em>distribution</em> as well as production ... But it was the coal
miners, through their victories in the two Februaries of 1972 and
1974 who gave to this Labour Unrest a structure, a final roundness
and completeness which their contribution of 1912 had failed to
supply to the earlier experience. First, they blew the Government
&#8216;off course&#8217;; then they landed it on the rocks. First, they
compelled the Prime Minister to receive them in 10 Downing Street &#8211;
which he had sworn he would never do &#8211; and forced him to concede
more in 24 hours than had been conceded in the last 24 years. Then
two years later their strike led him to introduce the three day week
&#8211; a novel system of Government by catastrophe &#8211; for which he was
rewarded with defeat at the General Election.</p>

<p class="quote">Nothing like this had ever been heard of before! <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Under Heath the government was compelled to declare a State of
Emergency no less than five times! What was the positive, active role
of the Labour Party in these massive struggles? The same as during
the Labour Unrest of 1910&#8211;14: <em>none</em>.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Who led the massive industrial struggles?</h4>

<p class="fst">Trotsky wrote of the apparently unplanned February 1917 revolution
that: &#8216;The mystic doctrine of spontaneousness explains nothing.&#8217;
<a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> This is true of all mass action.
There was a leadership in 1970&#8211;74, but it did not come from the
Labour Party.</p>

<p>Industrial militants traditionally looked to the Communist Party.
In 1966 this had founded the Liaison Committee for the Defence of
Trade Unions (LCDTU). Although the Communist Party had the direct
allegiance of only a minority of the country&#8217;s 300,000 or so
stewards, it had the ability to lead the shop stewards&#8217; movement as
a whole. The left Labour stewards, by contrast, had no similar
organisation, and Labour&#8217;s politics led away from any idea of such
a body as the LCDTU. It was the Liaison Committee which organised the
one-day strike involving half a million workers against Labour&#8217;s <strong>In
Place of Strife</strong> in 1969 and the massive unofficial strikes
against the Industrial Relations legislation. Communist Party
militants led the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders&#8217; struggle, and the
solidarity action to back it. The work-in adopted by UCS shop
stewards popularised factory occupations throughout Britain.</p>
<p>Like the New Unionist leaders of 1889, the syndicalists and the
wartime shop stewards, the leadership of the rank and file struggle
of the 1970s was a small organisation standing outside the
constraints of parliamentarism. Indeed it was only to the degree that
the Communist Party was independent of the trade union bureaucracy
and electoral methods, that it was able to channel the militant
resistance to capitalism.</p>

<p>But that independent position was already gravely compromised by
the Communist Party&#8217;s leadership. They had long abandoned
revolutionary socialism for a policy of changing British society
through achieving &#8216;a majority of Left Labour and Communist MPs&#8217;.
This logic had not yet nullified the membership&#8217;s lighting ability,
but it sapped it inexorably. The effect was to water down criticism
of the Labour left and left union bureaucrats. Stress was put on a
bureaucratic alliance with these forces in opposition to the right.</p>
<p>Since the 1960s the main form of Communist Party intervention in
industry has been the creation of &#8216;Broad Lefts&#8217; &#8211; alliances
with Labour left-wingers in the trade unions, whose main task was
organising resolutions and electing left officials. The same approach
affected the alliance of Broad Lefts across the unions &#8211; the LCDTU.</p>

<p>The contradiction between rank-and-file militancy and the
cultivation of left union officials blunted the impact of the LCDTU.
The crunch came in 1972. On 10 June 1200 LCDTU delegates met to call
for industrial action against the Tory Industrial Relations Act. But
when the Pentonville five were jailed the following month, the LCDTU
took no action because the Communist Party was desperate to
accommodate Jack Jones, leader of the TGWU, who opposed industrial
action. Four docks shop stewards wrote to <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>:
&#8216;If the average docker who took part in this struggle was asked
what the LCDTU did, they would not even know who they were&#8217;. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
Thereafter the LCDTU was little more than a rump, calling conferences
to pass resolutions but not leading any action.</p>

<p>Because the Communist Party&#8217;s politics were stifling the ability
of its rank and file militants to lead, this gave others an
opportunity to occupy a little of the space vacated. The once
minuscule International Socialists (IS), predecessors of the
Socialist Workers Party, were able to launch new initiatives,
because, unlike the Labour Party and to an increasing extent the
Communist Party, the IS stressed the importance that socialist
politics should have a firm base among workers at the point of
production, in the workplaces. As Alex Callinicos records:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Between 1971 and 1974 IS was transformed from being a
predominantly student to a predominantly working-class organization.
Crucial in this process was the decision by the IS conference of May
1973 to build factory branches. By the next conference, in September
1974, IS had nearly 4,000 members and some forty factory branches. At
the same time, IS members in various industries and unions had
launched rank-and-file papers whose aim was to group around them
militants who did not fully share their ideas but who were prepared
to work with them around concrete issues such as higher wages ...
these papers had by 1973 achieved a small, but nonetheless
significant circulation.</p>

<p class="quote">In the light of the LCDTU&#8217;s paralysis and its own
growing workplace base, IS took the first step towards building a
national rank-and-file movement by calling a delegate conference to
discuss the prospects of such a movement on 30 March 1974. 500
delegates representing 270 trade union bodies attended, and set up
the National Rank and File Organising Committee. A second conference
in November of the same year attracted delegates from a larger number
of bodies, including 49 shop stewards&#8217; committees, despite
Communist Party attempts at a witch-hunt, A new, albeit small
movement had, it seemed, been born. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There could hardly be a greater contrast between these efforts by
a tiny group of revolutionaries to relate to working-class activity
and what even the most left-wing of the Labour Party were doing at
the time. To underline this one needs but read Eric Heffer&#8217;s book,
<strong>The Class Struggle in Parliament: A Socialist View of Industrial
Relations</strong>, published in 1973. Its theme was the struggle against
the Tory Industrial Relations Act. Heffer was not only on the left of
the party, but had been a trade union militant before being elected
to parliament. Yet out of 339 pages, the UCS occupation, it seems,
deserved only six lines; the miners&#8217; strike, one page; Pentonville
and the national dock strike, again, one page. As against this, the
&#8216;brilliant&#8217; [Heffer&#8217;s word] speech of the right-wing Labour MP
Brian Walden against the Tory Industrial Relations Bill takes three
whole pages! Heffer explains in his book that he did his best not to
antagonise the official leadership of the TUC or Harold Wilson. He
says he favoured a one-day strike against the Bill but did not speak
openly for it &#8216;because I was tied by Front Bench responsibilities,&#8217;
<a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> [and] &#8216;I did not want to get at
cross purposes with what Harold Wilson had said.&#8217; <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p>The Labour Party as such <em>did nothing to develop mass militancy</em>,
although a great number of Labour Party supporters were involved in
the action. Once more they were not acting as members of the party.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The echo of the battle: Labour&#8217;s customary leftward swing</h4>

<p class="fst">Labour does not positively lead the working class, but it tails
the class in certain circumstances. The two factors that always
pushed Labour leftwards &#8211; pressure from without, and falling from
office &#8211; now combined. Spurred on by the tremendous industrial
militancy of the time, and in reaction to the Wilson government&#8217;s
miserable performance and the right-wing policy of the Tories, the
party swung sharply to the left. At the core of the Labour left was
the alliance of the TGWU and the AEU, led respectively by Jack |ones
and Hugh Scanlon. At the 1973 Conference their combined strength
accounted for 1,971,000 votes out of a total trade union vote of
5,449,000, and a total conference vote of 6,197,000. This block vote
provided the base for a powerful left-wing thrust.</p>

<p>Now the Labour leadership used radical rhetoric. Tony Benn staked
his claim as the spokesman of the Left and appeared at the UCS
occupation chatting to stewards. But even traditional right-wingers
like Denis Healey became political chameleons. Healey told the 1973 conference:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Our job is to get power, and we join battle armed with
the most radical and comprehensive programme we have had since 1945.
Its aim is honestly stated, to bring about a fundamental and
irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of
working people and their families. <em>(Applause)</em> ... We are going
to introduce a tax on wealth. We are going to turn the estate duty
into a real tax ... I warn you, there are going to be howls of
anguish from the 80,000 rich people. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Successive Labour Party conferences passed resolutions for more
public ownership. Between 1971 and 1973 they supported
nationalisation of banking, insurance and building societies, the
building industry, finance houses, road haulage, shipbuilding and
repair. <strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme for Britain</strong> (1972) proposed to
take back undertakings denationalised since 1970, without
compensation. It advocated extending public ownership to North Sea
oil, ports, pharmaceuticals, financial institutions, banking,
shipbuilding and repairing, and building land.</p>

<p>Labour adopted extreme unilateral nuclear disarmament policies,
the 1973 conference deciding:</p>

<p class="quoteb">it is opposed to any British defence policy which is
based on the use or threatened use of nuclear weapons, either by this
country or its allies, demands the closing down of all nuclear bases,
British and American on British soil or in British waters, and
demands that this pledge be included in the General Election
manifesto. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Even the party&#8217;s national executive showed growing left
influence and a degree of independence from the actions of the
parliamentary leadership.</p>

<p>After the previous Labour government&#8217;s cavalier attitude towards
conference resolutions, party democracy and the supremacy of
conference were all the rage. At the 1970 Labour conference Jack
Jones powerfully attacked elitism in government:</p>

<p class="quoteb">For too many Members of Parliament the constituency
Labour Party is a bit of a nuisance, a device for giving him a free
hand as the mood takes him ... we need greater influence from below,
not less. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the spirit of his speech the following resolution was carried
by 3,085,000 votes to 2,801,000, against the executive:</p>

<p class="quoteb">This Conference believes that the Parliamentary Labour
Party leaders, whether in government or opposition, should reflect
the views and aspirations of the Labour and Trade Union Movement, by
framing their policies on Annual Conference decisions ... it deplores
the Parliamentary Labour Party&#8217;s refusal to act on Conference
decisions.&#8217; <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1971 Scanlon demanded &#8216;a definite decision that decisions of
the Party Conference are binding on us all, and that includes every
MP in this Party,&#8217; <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a> while the
1973 party programme promised that &#8216;Policy in the Labour Party is
made by the members. The long-term programme of the Party is
determined by Annual Conference.&#8217; The party had embarked on a
struggle which would culminate in the constitutional changes made at
the 1981 Wembley Special Conference.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The birth of the Alternative Economic Strategy</h4>

<p class="fst">The Labour Party conference of 1973 adopted what was to become
known as the Alternative Economic Strategy. It was prompted by the
failure of traditional Keynesianism under the Wilson government.
Wilson had sacrificed expansion to maintain the confidence of the
financial markets and improve the balance of payments. To do so he
held down wages and raised taxes on working people, ending with the
fiasco of <strong>In Place of Strife</strong>.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s 1973 programme concluded that Britain must break the
chains that tied the country to world capitalism, and with massive
national reconstruction restore its position as a major industrial
power. The programme rested &#8216;on three major pillar ... new public
enterprise ... the planning agreements system ... [and] a new
Industry Act&#8217;.</p>

<p class="quoteb">New public enterprise was necessary to break complete
&#8216;domination of the economy by a few leading firms.&#8217; Therefore,</p>

<p class="quoteb">only direct control, through ownership, of a substantial
and vital sector of the growth industries, mainly in manufacturing,
which hold the key to investment performance, will allow a Labour
Government of the future to achieve its essential planning objectives
in the national interest. [An] expanded public sector is a key
element of the planning process ...</p>

<p class="fst">Public ownership would be exercised through a National Enterprise
Board (NEB) based on &#8216;existing State shareholdings ... with a
substantial addition of ... <em>some twenty-five of our largest</em>
[<em>private</em>] <em>manufacturers</em>.&#8217; This would be required
&#8216;<em>very early in the life of the Board</em>.&#8217; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p>Apparently George Brown&#8217;s National Plan had not failed because
<em>planning capitalism is impossible</em>. It had just not been
ambitious enough. So the programme called for a Planning Agreements
system, to include:</p>

<p class="quoteb">all the major companies in this country ... certainly the
largest 100 or so manufacturing firms &#8211; and all the major public
enterprises. Its role will include the following: to get up-to-date
information [which] will concern both past performance and <em>advance</em>
programmes ... investment, prices, product development, marketing,
exports and import requirements.</p>

<p class="fst">Labour would use this to:</p>

<p class="quoteb">provide a systematic basis for making large companies
accountable for their behaviour, and for bringing into line those
which refuse to co-operate.</p>

<p class="fst">To make international capital accountable, special measures were suggested:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We shall seek to ensure, for example, that the Government
has the right to appoint public directors to the resident subsidiary
companies of non-resident multi-nationals and to the main boards of
resident multi-nationals; that the state &#8211; possibly through the NEB
&#8211; is able to acquire shares in the parent company of
multi-nationals and place a director in the board ...</p>

<p class="fst">This was nothing if ambitious. Judith Hart said on 24 June 1973
that the NEB would be used radically to transform the structure of
the economy:</p>

<p class="quoteb">at the end of a five-year term <em>one-third of the
turnover of the top 100 manufacturers</em>, who account for about half
of our net manufacturing output and <em>two-fifths of their profits
and about half their employment, should be invested with the board</em>.
<a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">To do this all that was needed was for the six hundred or so
individuals reclining on the benches of the Palace of Westminster to
pass a New Industry Act. Instantly the government would have real
powers to intervene. All the above measures, the programme claimed,
would remedy the comparatively low rates of investment in the British
economy, hence rebuilding British industrial capacity and raising its
productivity to world levels. To reduce the influence of
international capitalism, Britain should leave the EEC. Only then
could economic sovereignty be regained, only then could the British
state plan the national economy.</p>

<p>As the Alternative Economic Strategy was developed, new elements
were introduced such as stringent control over the export of capital.
Sterling would cease to be an international currency and would no
longer be freely convertible. Foreign exchange controls would aim not
only to halt runs on the pound, but also to prevent the expansion of
British firms abroad rather than in the domestic economy. While the
bulk of the economy would still be privately owned, the state would
be the dominant force.</p>

<p>Safeguarded by import quotas from balance-of-payments problems,
the government would make the achievement of full employment and
economic growth its top priorities. This would be achieved by
expanding demand; in this way Keynesian policy would come back into
its own. In essence the Alternative Economic Strategy was nothing but
revamped nationalist Keynesianism.</p>

<p>To strengthen the popular support for the Alternative Economic
Strategy, <strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme 1973</strong> offered a few extra
goodies. After all if you are writing a cheque that will bounce, why
not enter some astronomic figure?:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>Economic Equality:</em></p>

<p class="quoteb">... We are therefore now determined to launch a
fundamental attack on the principle of the hereditary transmission of
great wealth, with its associated power and privilege, and the
accumulation of unearned gains ...</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>Industrial Democracy:</em></p>

<p class="quoteb">... we are considering the provision of direct
representation for workers &#8211; with this representation being based
firmly upon trade union channels, and being directly accountable to
the workers in the company concerned. We are also considering with
the TUC introducing the &#8216;Supervisory Board&#8217; to British
company structure. Such a Board would then be responsible for overall
company policy and practice ...</p>

<p class="fst">The Alternative Economic Strategy was completely unrealistic,
utopian. With the bulk of industry remaining in private hands, with
profit as the main spur of economic activity, would the most powerful
sector of British capital &#8211; the multi-nationals and the banks &#8211;
meekly accept the nationalisation of 25 leading companies and the
<em>diktat</em> of the state and its planning agreements? Would the
multi-nationals acquiesce with the appointment of directors by the
government without a fight? Would they accept democratic control of
industry? Would the present state machine &#8211; the civil service,
judiciary, police and army &#8211; break the &#8216;strike of capital&#8217; if
big business resisted?</p>

<p>The Alternative Economic Strategy, it seemed, would be good for
the workers &#8211; achieving full employment &#8211; and for the nation &#8211;
restoring the international competitiveness of the British economy.
It was the old, tired Labour synthesis of class and nation, reworked.</p>
<p>The picketing of Saltley gates, which led to the closing of a coke
depot in the Midlands, seems pale in comparison with these
world-shattering proposals. Yet the battle of Saltley gates had one
important advantage, it advanced the <em>real</em> workers&#8217; movement
to a position of confidence and power it had not held for half a
century. The Alternative Economic Strategy, on the other hand, <em>was
totally stillborn</em>.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The Social Contract</h4>

<p class="fst">An integral part of <strong>Labour&#8217;s Programme 1973</strong> was &#8216;a far
reaching <em>social contract</em> between workers and the Government &#8211;
a contract which can be renewed each year as circumstances and as new
opportunities present themselves.&#8217; The way for such an agreement
had been prepared by the establishment, in January 1972 of a joint
&#8216;Liaison Committee&#8217; of the Parliamentary Labour Party, party
executive and the TUC. In February 1973 this produced a compact,
titled <em>Economic Policy and the Cost of Living</em> which became part
of the 1973 programme of the party.</p>

<p>The compact included the repeal of the Industrial Relations Act,
extension of industrial democracy, a Royal Commission on incomes
distribution, and the establishment of a Conciliation and Arbitration
Service. It also mentioned new public enterprises, effective public
supervision of the investment policies of large private corporations,
new taxes on wealth, a redistribution of wealth and income, and
direct statutory control of prices, particularly of food, housing and
rent. Finally there were commitments on pensions, housing, health
service charges and withdrawal from the EEC.</p>

<p>Through the influence of Jones, Scanlon, Benn and the Communist
Party&#8217;s network of supporters, the idea of Social Contracts and
Alternative Economic Strategies filtered down to a substantial number
of militants.</p>

<p>In the 1974 election the Social Contract proved invaluable to
Labour. Its campaign, far from reflecting the fighting minority,
stressed that the Social Contract proved that Labour could handle the
unions when Heath could not. But its greatest role was to come. As we
shall see, after 1974 it was the Social Contract &#8211; in support of
which the left union leaders Jones and Scanlon played a crucial role
&#8211; which strangled the rank and file militancy which had gripped
Britain under Heath.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Parasite Lost</h4>

<p class="fst">Given the radical policies adopted by Labour conferences during
the years of the Heath government, it is surprising to find that the
organised Labour left was weak. The Tribune Group was the only
serious force, and for such influence as it had it depended on a
number of big unions which for the moment went along with it. Despite
<strong>Tribune</strong>&#8217;s vocal denunciation of past Labour government
policies there were close links between the its former editor Michael
Foot, the party leader Harold Wilson, and the TGWU general secretary
Jack Jones. It was this triumvirate that acted as a reconciling force
between the party executive and the leadership of the PLP. Who of the
three was paramount became obvious after Wilson was returned to
Downing Street in 1974. He dragged the big unions along, and they in
turn pulled the Tribunite left.</p>

<p>Indeed despite the mighty industrial struggles and the left
rhetoric, the Labour Party did not do well at all. <em>Individual
membership of the party actually went down.</em> It was 690,191 in
1970, and 665,379 in 1973. As pointed out elsewhere, membership
figures were distorted by the rule that every constituency party must
affiliate on the basis of at least 1,000 members. Nevertheless the
figures make the general trend clear.</p>

<p>Things were also bad electorally. In the four years of the second
Wilson government, 1966&#8211;1970, Labour lost 15 seats in parliamentary
by-elections and won none. Under Heath, between 1970 and 1974, Labour
had made only one gain from the Tories, while in 1973 it lost Lincoln
to Dick Taverne, the Labour renegade who became a Social Democrat,
Rochdale to the Liberals, and Govan to the Scottish Nationalists. The
memory of the 1966&#8211;70 Labour government was still fresh in the minds
of the voters. The experience of the Wilson government had lowered
the threshold of Labour&#8217;s electoral support on a long-term basis.</p>

<p>The Labour vote did not benefit from the radicalising effect of
class struggle. This was a serious sign for the future. Since the
birth of the Labour Party there had been a link, albeit indirect and
tenuous, but real nevertheless, between the class struggle and voting
Labour. Now the aspirations aroused by victories of workers&#8217;
struggle at Pentonville, Saltley and many other places seemed so
divorced from the known record of what Labour could offer that lor a
growing number of workers, the link had snapped.</p>

<p>Thus only a minority of workers drew general political conclusions
from the great struggles of the early 1970s. As a result, although
Labour won the general election of February 1974, its vote was lower
than in 1970 by 531,904, or 6 per cent. Compared to 1966, there had
been a loss of 1,418,560 &#8211; or 10 per cent. The 1974 election added
a new twist to the see-saw effect described earlier. Having tried
both Labour and Tories under conditions of crisis, many voters
abandoned the two major parties in the elusive search for a better
parliamentary alternative. The growth of nationalist parties was one
sign of this, but the main beneficiaries were the Liberals. Their
share of the vote, which had been 8.5 per cent in 1966, now stood at
19.3 per cent. It was this that allowed Labour to defeat the Tories. <a href="#na" name="fa">[1*]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Labour had come to office with an extremely radical
left-wing programme and during the greatest wave of working-class
struggle for half a century. How would the party respond?</p>

<h3 class="western">Footnote</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#fa" name="na">1*.</a> A sign of the disillusionment with
both main parties was that together Tories and Labour had received
96.8 per cent of the votes in 1951; in 1974 this dropped to only 74.9
per cent.</p>
