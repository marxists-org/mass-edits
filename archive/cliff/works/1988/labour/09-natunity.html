<h3>The Labour Party</h3>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h1>9: From Socialist Dictatorship to National Unity:<br/>
Labour in the 1930s</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">IT IS A COMMON FEATURE of Labour&#8217;s history that it swings
leftwards after severe electoral setbacks, only to &#8216;recover its
senses&#8217; and return to its traditional stance in time for the next
election This was true of Bevanism which grew up after the 1951
defeat, and of Bennism, which was stimulated by Tory victories in
1970 and 1979. But both movements seem pale in comparison with tin
radical images conjured up by the left in the 1930s.</p>
<p>The circumstances of the time powerfully contributed to this mood.
The collapse of the second Labour government and disastrous election
result had been engineered by international finance and clearly put
into question the notion of a peaceful constitutional transition to
socialism. Doubts were reinforced by the destruction of German
bourgeois democracy by the Nazis, and by the slump. As Frank Wise, a
leading left-winger, told the 1933 Labour conference: &#8216;we are at
the parting of the ways. We have either to go forward to Socialism or
acquiesce in Fascism.&#8217; <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p>Unlike earlier radical postures, the leftism of the 1930s was not
adopted to contain mass pressure from without. Even the right which
had for years supported MacDonald, felt suddenly robbed of the old
certainties, and toyed with new ideas. Although for the mainstream
the political spasm was short-lived, it produced language far
stronger than anything uttered since.</p>

<p>Thus Clem Attlee promised to deliver a death blow to capitalism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The moment to strike is the moment of taking power when
the Government is freshly elected and assured of its support. The
blow struck must be a fatal one and not merely designed to wound and
to turn a sullen and obstructive opponent into an active and deadly
enemy. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">He even moved towards the concept of a revolutionary party: &#8216;The
most urgent job of every socialist now is to ... create advance
guards of the revolution, and to create them <em>now</em>. For when the
revolution comes it will be too late.&#8217; <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a>
He suggested they &#8216;should train people to take over the commanding
positions in the army and navy in the event of a revolution.&#8217; <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Herbert Morrison, a right-winger whose first reaction to the
collapse of the second Labour government was to seek a place in the
new National Government <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> swung sharply
to the left. His Initial reaction to the 1931 election result was:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Labour must move to the Left in the true sense of the
term &#8211; to the real Socialist Left. Not the spurious left policy of
handing out public money under the impression that we are achieving a
redistribution of wealth under the capitalist system. That is one of
the illusions of reformism ... The brain and manual workers ... must
be organized for the mutual service of the Commonwealth and not
merely to collar the crumbs from the rich man&#8217;s table. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The most Christian R.H. Tawney now argued that capitalism could
not be abolished gradually: &#8216;onions can be eaten leaf by leaf, but
you cannot skin a live tiger paw by paw; vivisection is its trade and
it does the skinning first.&#8217; <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> Drunk
with rhetoric, Hugh Gaitskell wanted to:</p>

<p class="quoteb">smash the economic power of the upper class. When they
had the power he believed they would be in a position to carry into
action measures which were essentially revolutionary ... <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Exit the ILP</h4>

<p class="fst">The collapse of the second Labour government produced a new
alignment on the Labour left. An opening for new forces had appeared
because the ILP had broken away.</p>

<p>During 1929&#8211;31 the ILP had had 142 members among 17 of whom were
financially sponsored by the ILP. Each was asked to accept &#8216;the
policy of the ILP as laid down by of the Annual Conference&#8217; <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>
&#8211; apparently a modest and reasonable request. <em>Only eleven
ILP-sponsored MPs agreed,</em> along with seven others! When the
government collapsed in 1931 the ILP tore itself apart. Its
conference voted to quit Labour in despair, while the majority of MPs
left to stay with the Labour Party.</p>

<p>From this point on the ILP was in serious decline. It had not
split in order to build a new movement on the basis of separate
politics, but chiefly to preserve the independence of its left
reformist parliamentarians. With shallow roots in the working class,
the ILP found itself living off past accumulated capital that
dwindled quickly. Membership plummeted &#8211; from 16,773 in 1931 to
11,092 in 1932 and just 4,392 in 1935. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Cripps &#8211; A Jacobin in the ranks?</h4>

<p class="fst">The collapse of the 1929&#8211;31 government had its strongest impact
on Stafford Cripps, who became the most prominent front bencher after
George Lansbury. Cripps was a very new recruit to the Labour Party,
having joined it as recently as May 1929. He became an MP straight
away, his path being smoothed by Morrison and his uncle and aunt &#8211;
the Webbs. Cripps was offered a place in the National Government by
MacDonald, and because of admiration for the man, it took him some
time to make up his mind to reject the offer. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p>But after the 1931 election he became a new person, turning the
famous Fabian statement on its head: &#8216;It is not now a question of
the inevitability of gradualness. The one thing which is not
inevitable now is gradualness.&#8217; <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a>
Reformists did not understand how false was the old belief &#8216;that
the capitalists will permit the change to be made within capitalism.
The whole history of the Social Democratic movement in Europe
negatives any such idea.&#8217; <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p>Cripps predicted the need to thwart the opposition not only of
international capitalism, but &#8216;Buckingham Palace&#8217; and the army!
He wrote of the first: &#8216;I cannot imagine the Labour Party coming
into power without a first rate financial crisis. That is why we ask
for full emergency powers.&#8217; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> On
the second He said: When the Labour Party comes into power we shall
have to overcome opposition from Buckingham Palace and other places
as well.&#8217; <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a> He finished by
arguing: &#8216;We have to face the problem of dealing with the armed
forces of the Crown. The Labour Party has to be prepared to take
steps more forceful than the steps taken at the time of the Ulster
rebellion.&#8217; <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p>His position was summarised in his essay <em>Can Socialism come by
Constitutional Means?</em>, where he argued that to defeat its enemies
a future Labour government would have to resort to draconian measures:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Government&#8217;s first step will be to call Parliament
together at the earliest moment and place before it an Emergency
Powers Bill to be passed through all its stages on the first day.
This Bill will be wide enough in its terms to allow all that will be
immediately necessary to be done by ministerial orders. These orders
must be incapable of challenge in the Courts or in any way except in
the House of Commons ... the Socialist Government would make itself
temporarily into a dictatorship until the matter could again be put
to the test at the polls. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">We have no more challenging statement from Labour leaders than
this. However it is essential to separate oratory from serious intent
There is a simple test. Is the politician ready <em>to will the means
as well as say the words?</em> Cripps never dreamt of going
beyond parliamentarism, which meant his statements remained little
more than daring oratory.</p>

<p>Thus when the National Government, the Labour leadership and the
press attacked Cripps for his slur on the monarchy, his defence was
that he was &#8216;most certainly not referring to the Crown.&#8217; He had
used the words Buckingham Palace as &#8216;a well-known expression used
to describe Court Circles and the officials and other people who
surround the King.&#8217; Anyway, he wanted the monarchy retained! <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p>On another occasion Cripps was attacked by the attorney-general
who accused him of advocating violent revolution. This was too much
for Cripps, who replied: &#8216;I have always condemned revolutionary
means and the Communist movement which relies on such means. I have
stated that I believed in a very rapid change in the system by the
method of Parliamentary Democracy.' <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>

<p>In Cripps&#8217; writings and speeches at the time there was never a
hint that workers&#8217; industrial power should be mobilised for
political ends. His radical suggestion for the next Labour government
to introduce Emergency Powers was encased within Labour&#8217;s
parliamentary tradition.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Rise and fall of the Socialist League</h4>

<p class="fst">In October 1932 the Socialist League was founded to fight for the
sort of radical policies Cripps advocated. It was a small
organisation which at its peak in March 1934 claimed 74 branches and
about 3,000 members. <a href="#na" name="fa">[1*]</a> It brought
together a number of left MPs and intellectuals, including Frank
Wise, Aneurin Bevan, George Strauss, Clem Attlee, Sir Charles
Trevelyan, William Mellor, Ellen Wilkinson, D.N. Pritt, Harold Laski
and H.N. Brailsford. Cripps was chairman while J.T. Murphy, who quit
the Communist Party in 1931, was its secretary. Murphy saw the League
as &#8216;the organisation of revolutionary socialists who are an
integral part of the Labour movement for the purpose of winning it
completely for revolutionary socialism.&#8217; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>As long as the Labour leadership was stunned by &#8216;MacDonald&#8217;s
betrayal&#8217; the League was an effective ginger group. For a couple of
years &#8211; 1932 and 1933 &#8211; it was given free rein and enjoyed an
influence out of proportion to its size.</p>

<p>At the 1932 Labour Conference Frank Wise defeated the platform
with his proposal to go beyond nationalisation of the Bank of England
to take other banks into public ownership on the grounds that control
of them would be essential for real socialist planning. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a>
Another successful League resolution laid down &#8216;that the leaders of
the next Labour Government and the Parliamentary Labour Party be
instructed by the National Conference that, on assuming office ...
definite Socialist legislation must be immediately promulgated ... we
must have Socialism in deed as well as in words.&#8217; <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p>Henderson warned conference against tying the Parliamentary Labour
Party&#8217;s hands. But Attlee supported the resolution, on these grounds:</p>

<p class="quoteb">we are bound in duty to those whom we represent to tell
them quite clearly that they cannot get Socialism without tears, that
whenever we try to do anything we will be opposed by every vested
financial, political, and social, and I think we have got to face the
fact that, even if we are returned with a majority, we shall have to
fight all the way. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">So clear was the sentiment of the delegates for the resolution
that it was carried without a card vote. <a href="#nb" name="fb">[2*]</a></p>

<p>At the 1933 conference, the left resumed its offensive. Cripps
wanted an assurance that the next Labour government would immediately
abolish the House of Lords, and pass an Emergency Act &#8216;to take over
or regulate the financial machine, and to put into force any measure
that the situation may require for the immediate control or
socialisation of industry and for safeguarding the supply of food and
other necessaries.&#8217; <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p>However this important motion was not voted on. Despite all its
verbal radicalism, the left had an Achilles heel, which showed when
Cripps announced his willingness to grant the executive a year to
consider the problems raised by their resolution. He thus avoided a
vote and direct confrontation.</p>

<p>The victories of the left at the 1932 and 1933 Labour Party
Conferences were victories on paper. It remained to be seen whether
the millions of votes cast for the League at conferences represented
any genuine shift of opinion among the working class.</p>

<p>The panic engendered in 1931 began to subside by the middle of the
decade. The empire cushioned British capitalism from the worn rigours
of the slump: Britain did not have 33 per cent unemployment, like the
US, or six million out of work, as Germany did when Hitler took
power. Bourgeois democracy survived and Labour leadership discovered
that reformist business could go on. The blood and thunder of the
Socialist League need be tolerated no longer.</p>

<p>The right reasserted its dominance at the 1934 Labour Conference.
The political perspective and language of the Socialist League still
had great influence, but once the official juggernaut began moving
even the most brilliant arguments on the conference could not stop
it. The Socialist League was thrashed.</p>

<p>The main debates centred around the general document <strong>For
Socialism and Peace</strong>. Subtitled &#8216;The Labour Party&#8217;s Programme
for Action&#8217;, the executive described it as &#8216;a comprehensive and
concise statement of policy.&#8217; <strong>For Socialism and Peace</strong> was
far more incisive and definite than <strong>Labour and the Nation</strong>
(1928). But it was vague about the time scale for public takeovers
and emphasised &#8216;the achievement of change by the process of
consent.&#8217; The Labour Party &#8216;sees no reason why a people who,
first in the world, advanced through Parliamentary institutions their
political and religious freedoms should not, by the same means,
achieve their economic emancipation.&#8217; <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p><strong>For Socialism and Peace</strong> challenged the idea of drastic
emergency powers against capitalist obstruction. The Socialist League
was not about to let such statements go, and it put down no fewer
than twenty-two amendments to the draft &#8211; but lost all along the line.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Communist Party moulds the Labour left</h4>

<p class="fst">By 1934 disastrous defeats at Labour conference had cruelly
exposed how shallow the League&#8217;s base really was. To discover new
sources of influence, it therefore turned to the Communist Party.
Although both bodies shared common characteristics the contrast
between them is instructive.</p>

<p>The fundamental weakness of the Labour left was lack of real links
with the working class. It could mobilise constituency support, but
when it came to the union block vote at conferences, the Labour left
could only act indirectly, through the medium of the Communist Party.
Cripps, Bevan or Pritt did not derive their political influence as
representatives of workers in collective struggle, but from their
standing in parliamentary politics; from oratorical brilliance, not
the ability to lead activity. They occupied roles which gave them
much more publicity than influence. So they were ready to quarrel
with the leadership of the Labour Party, but not to break decisively
with Labourism, as that would have meant undermining the element in
the situation that gave them prominence.</p>

<p>The Labour Left was very heterogeneous, since left-wing criticism
of the leadership could reflect a multitude of varied motives. Thus
the National Council of the Socialist League, included D.N. Pritt,
the most ardent Stalinist, and the ex-Liberal Sir Charles Trevelyan,
an enthusiastic supporter of the League of Nations.</p>

<p>The Communist Party was quite different. It was a tightly
organised body, but alas no longer the revolutionary party Lenin had
helped to establish. After 1926 it uncritically followed every twist
and turn made by the Comintern, itself a tool of the new Russian
bureaucracy. However the Communist Party had one great advantage over
the Socialist League. It still rejected Labour parliamentary
cretinism and stressed workers&#8217; collective organisation, even if
this was ultimately subordinated to the <em>diktat</em> of Stalinism.
It had direct roots in the working class. This was demonstrated when
the labour movement, practically dormant since 1926, re-awoke.</p>

<p>A low point had been reached when, from 1929 to 1933, the slump
had dealt a further blow to trade union organisation, workers&#8217;
confidence and the ability to fight. However from 1934 onwards things
started changing. The number of trade unionists rose from 4,392,000
in 1933 to 6,298,000 in 1939. The number of strikes also rose from
359 in 1933 to a pre-war peak of 1,129 in 1937. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p>This owed nothing to the Labour left, and still less the Labour
Party as a whole. Labour can reflect the movement in distorted form
but it never initiates.</p>

<p>Richard Croucher&#8217;s book, <strong>Engineers at War</strong>, explains some
reasons for the revival:</p>

<p class="quoteb">From about the beginning of 1934 there was a real change
in the nature and tone of industrial relations in the engineering
industry ... The effect of seeing old mates, even in ones and twos,
coming back into the shops, was out of all proportion to the numbers
involved. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The aircraft industry led the way, the number of workers leaping
from 17,600 in 1930 to 140,000 in spring 1939. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a>
Within the industry militant strikes were organised by a
Communist-led shop stewards&#8217; movement &#8211; the Aircraft Shop
Stewards&#8217; National Council and its paper, <strong>The Propellor</strong>.</p>

<p>1937 witnessed two strike waves of engineering apprentices which
spread through the north and down to London. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a>
Croucher writes that the movement &#8216;for sheer enthusiasm and
Minimisation invites comparison with the industrial upsurges in
France and America in the same year&#8217;. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a>
Once more the Communist Party was in the lead, the chairman of the
central strike committee being in the Young Communist League.</p>

<p>The same pattern was repeated in mining. To resist both the
breakaway scab union run by George Spencer and the pressure towards
&#8216;non-political&#8217; unionism, the rank and file developed a new
weapon, a stay-down strike. The main battle came in 1937 when miners
at Harworth, who had overwhelmingly voted to join the Miners
Federation, were compelled by the company to continue in subscribe to
the Spencer union. Six miners were sentenced to terms of hard labour
for picketing offences under the 1927 Trades Disputes Act and
strikers were threatened with eviction from company-owned houses. The
Miners&#8217; Federation voted for national strike action in Harworth&#8217;s
defence and management backed down. The Spencer union and its
officials were then absorbed into the Federation, which now became
the negotiating body for the industry. Once more Communists were in
the forefront of the fight. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a> Indeed
in practically all the significant strikes of these years Communist
Party members played a prominent part.</p>

<p>Besides its own organisation in industry, the Communist Party
relied on some ancillary organisations. First there was the National
Unemployed Workers&#8217; Movement, which had considerable support. In
contrast, throughout the 1930s the Labour Party did nothing practical
about unemployment. It approved only of moves that assisted
parliamentary opposition, believing little could be done until it was
itself returned to office.</p>

<p>To fight the evil of unemployment &#8216;the TUC promoted only the one
demonstration, in February 1933, while the Labour Party remained
opposed to demonstrations because of the threat to public order.&#8217;
<a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a> The TUC demonstration was
organised in complete collaboration with the police. This passive
approach was significant. It presented the unemployed as helpless
victims pleading for charity from society. A serious campaign against
unemployment, for which the only solution was the abolition of
capitalism, wan bound to challenge law and order. That was why mass
march supported by the Communist Party were regularly met with
brutality by the police.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Labour Party to the active unemployed movement
was summed up well by John Saville:</p>

<p class="quoteb">What was not lacking in vigour was the denunciation by
the Labour leadership of bodies outside the Labour Party who were
engaged in agitation on behalf of the unemployed. The most important
was the National Unemployed Workers&#8217; Movement, who organised
national hunger marches to London on four occasions: 1930, 1932, 1934
and 1936. Not one of these marches was officially supported, and in
the first two the local Labour parties and trades council
specifically instructed to offer no help. The reason was that the
NUWM was led by Communists. Only in 1936 &#8211; and to a lesser extent
in 1934 &#8211; were the bans imposed widely disregarded. In the 1936
reception in Hyde Park Attlee was among a number of leading Labour
personalities who spoke from one of the platforms. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Saville chooses the Jarrow march as the best example of Labour&#8217;s
&#8216;stupid, reactionary and politically self-destructive&#8217; attitudes.
<a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> Though one of the smallest hunger
marches during the 1930s, it became legendary because it tamely
obeyed the rules and did not seek to challenge the authorities. This
self-styled &#8216;non-political&#8217; march excluded known Communists and
set off after every church and chapel in Jarrow had said prayers for
it and the Suffragan Bishop had blessed it. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a>
It sent the respective Tory and Labour agents for the constituency
ahead to make arrangements.</p>

<p>In London, instead of the usual welcome for the unemployed &#8211; the
end of a police truncheon, the Commons provided tea for the marchers
and they were given the opportunity of &#8216;cheering lustily&#8217; as the
king passed their vantage point in the Mall. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>

<p>Ellen Wilkinson, MP for Jarrow, takes up the story. When she
reached the 1936 Labour Party Conference things changed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I went from the warm comradeship of the road to an
atmosphere of official disapproval. The Trades Union Congress had
frowned on the marches, and the Labour Party Executive followed the
lead ... The Labour Party drew out, and the TUC circularized the
Trades Council advising them against giving help. So in places like
Chesterfield, where the Trades and Labour Council obeyed the
circular, the Conservative Party weighed in with hot meals and a
place to sleep. Mostly, of course, the comradeship of the trade
unions and the Labour Movement was circular-proof on such an occasion
... <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>

<p class="fst">She was denounced from the conference platform for &#8216;sending
hungry and ill-clad men across the country on a march to London.&#8217;
Her reply:</p>

<p class="quoteb">You cannot expect men, trapped in these distressed areas,
to stay there and starve because it is not convenient to have them
coming to London. What has the National Council done? It disapproved
of it. What has gone from the General Council? Letters to the local
areas in fact saying, in the politest language, &#8216;Do not help these
men.&#8217; Why? Because some of these marchers might be Communists. I
hope when Sir Walter Citrine gets to the pearly gates St Paul will be
able to assure him there is no Communist inside.</p>

<p class="fst">The executive &#8216;would not even let us take a collection for these
Men.&#8217; <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p>Another striking contrast between the attitudes of the Communist
Party and the Labour Party to the primary issues of the 1930s was the
question of Mosley&#8217;s fascists. The Labour leaders may genuinely
detest fascism and all its works. They have good reason, for fascism
tries to annihilate all workers&#8217; organisations, upon which the
reformists rely. However it is one thing to hate an enemy, it is
another to know how to fight him. Precisely because fascists do not
accept the rules of the parliamentary game, using terrorism and
intimidation on the streets rather than the ballot box, the Labour
Party finds it difficult to offer any practical resistance.</p>

<p>Thus in the 1930s the Labour Party was neither active nor
effective, doing nothing to stop the march of the fascists, and not
daring to go beyond passive protest against fascism.</p>

<p>When the Communist Party and ILP issued a call to demonstrate
against the supporters of Mosley gathering at a mass rally in Hyde
Park on 9 September 1934, the Labour Party executive declared that
the counter-demonstration &#8216;would almost inevitably lead to
widespread disorder,&#8217; and Labour supporters should &#8216;refrain from
having anything whatever to do with the proposal.&#8217; <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p>Labour leaders&#8217; cynicism reached its height over the Battle of
Cable Street of 4 October 1936. Mosley&#8217;s Blackshirts decided to
march through Stepney, at the time the centre of London&#8217;s Jewish
population. The Communist Party and ILP called for a mass
demonstration to stop them and called on the local union branches,
trades councils and Labour Party to support a counter march. Between
100,000 and 150,000 people took to the streets to stop 3,000
fascists. Notwithstanding the protection of 6,000 policemen plus all
London&#8217;s mounted police, the fascists could not pass through Cable Street.</p>

<p>What was the reaction of the Labour Party leaders? George
Lansbury, whose pleas to the Home Secretary to divert the march
failed, issued a statement urging people to stay away; the <strong>Daily
Herald</strong> and the <strong>News Chronicle</strong> on 1 October implored
readers to follow this advice, the latter saying &#8216;The Communist has
no more right to break up a Fascist meeting than the fascist has to
break up a Communist demonstration.&#8217; <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p>The day after the Battle of Cable Street Morrison declared at the
Labour Party Conference: &#8216;I have no more sympathy with those who
desire to stimulate disorder from one side as I have with those who
desire to stimulate disorder from the other ...&#8217; All he did was
move an executive resolution to prohibit the wearing of political
uniforms. This was approved unanimously. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a></p>

<p>John Saville summed up the role of the Labour Party thus:</p>

<p class="quoteb">All the major political initiatives and campaigns for
which the 1930s are remembered were conducted either against the
expressed wishes of the Labour leadership or without their approval. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Given the contrast between the complete passivity of the Labour
Party and the energy of the Communist Party it was no surprise that
Cripps and Co. should become increasingly dependent upon the latter.
This was notwithstanding the tiny membership of the Communist Party,
which, though it rose from 6,500 in 1935 to 12,250 in 1937, was
dwarfed by the Labour Party.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Political dependence</h4>

<p class="fst">The Labour left in the 1930s was dependent on the Communist Party
both for links with extra-parliamentary activity and for its ideas.</p>

<p>Keir Hardie&#8217;s ILP had been an amalgam of ethical arguments,
Liberalism and above all Fabianism &#8211; all three originating from
within the ruling class. Maxton&#8217;s ILP leant heavily on the ideas of
the former Liberal J.A. Hobson. Soon the Liberals Keynes and
Beveridge would gain ascendancy. It might appear that the Socialist
League was an exception, since it rejected all of these trends, as
symbolised by Cripps&#8217; repudiation of &#8216;the inevitability of
gradualness&#8217;. Its close relations with the Communist Party led it
to talk about Marxism.</p>

<p>But the Communist Party was now a thoroughly Stalinist
organisation. Was Stalinism based on a different social class from
Fabianism or Liberalism? <a href="#nc" name="fc">[3*]</a> Although
Stalinism had completely different origins &#8211; in the strangulation
of the spirit of 1917, in the physical elimination of Bolsheviks and
in the breakneck accumulation of capital through the exploitation of
the peasantry and workers&#8211;&#8211;in fact it represented just another
ruling-class theory, that of state capitalist bureaucracy. It still
employed the rhetoric of Marxism but only to cloak its intentions. So
the &#8216;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8217; had been transformed into
the dictatorship of the bureaucracy, the socialist planned economy
had been changed into five year plans for the forced
industrialisation of a new capitalist state.</p>

<p>Of course when Cripps and the Socialist League talked of the need
for a period of Labour government dictatorship and centralised
economic planning they believed the Russian model represented a real
socialist alternative to the chaos and looming fascism they saw in
Western Europe. Nor was the Socialist League alone. The belief that
planning and other Stalinist measures in themselves equal socialism
was only seriously resisted by tiny groups of Trotskyists.
Nevertheless, whether consciously or not, the League fell into the
familiar trap of even the most extreme left reformists, and by
relying on a ruling-class theory paid the political price.</p>

<p>So long as the marriage held, it was the Communist Party that
overwhelmingly dictated terms. This becomes crystal clear if one
reads <strong>Left News</strong> and above all <strong>Tribune</strong>, the weekly paper
launched by Cripps on 1 January 1937. Many Socialist Leaguers
practically became mouthpieces of Stalinism. Harold Laski, for
example, relished the vile prosecution of Trotsky, whose supporters
he described as &#8216;strong allies of Nazi Germany in her militarist
plans.&#8217; <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a> John Strachey had no
doubt that the Moscow Trials were absolutely fair. He was:</p>

<p class="quoteb">wholly convinced of the authenticity of the confessions.
I can only say that no man can advance his political education more
than by studying this supreme historical document of our time. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The solid wall of support for the Moscow Trials was breached for a
time only when Marshal Tukhachevsky and other top officers of the
Russian army were executed. The outcry in the Labour movement was far
too great for <strong>Tribune</strong> to remain untouched. A number of trade
unions that had supported the Socialist League-Communist Party
alliance in 1936 now reversed their position including the engineers
and the miners.</p>

<p>Until that time practically every issue of <strong>Tribune</strong> was
adorned with pictures of smiling Russian children. Seven consecutive
issues of the paper had a whole page on <em>Women in the Soviet Union</em>,
by Barbara Betts, later better known as Barbara Castle. An entire
page of the paper was devoted to Stalin&#8217;s unscrupulous <strong>History
of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)</strong>, the
superlative &#8216;book of the hour&#8217;. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a></p>

<p>When Russian foreign policy made a sharp turn with signing of the
Hitler-Stalin pact in the summer of 1939 the marriage was put in
jeopardy. Even then <strong>Tribune&#8217;s</strong> initial reaction was to praise
the Russians:</p>

<p class="quoteb">A pact of non-aggression between Russia and Germany, if
it is signed, will be a great reinforcement for peace in Eastern
Europe. At the same time it is a lie to suggest that it leaves
Germany a free hand against Poland or anyone else. <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Even after the Russian invasion of Poland on 17 September,
articles appeared in <strong>Tribune</strong> justifying Russian foreign
policy. This only stopped in November with the outbreak of Russia&#8217;s
war on Finland. From then onwards only the Communist Party slavishly
followed the Moscow <em>diktat</em>, while the Labour left adopted a
policy of the defence of Britain.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Foreign policy</h4>

<p class="fst">This brings us on to the dominant issues of the 1930s: foreign
affairs and the approach of war. The mainstream of the Labour Party
soon settled into its customary position&#8211;&#8211;supporting the
traditional policies of the capitalist state and perhaps putting a
vague reformist gloss upon them. For the most part Labour&#8217;s slogan
was &#8216;collective security under the League of Nations&#8217;. However
there were some who disagreed, including Lansbury, who was party
leader after MacDonald&#8217;s desertion and the defeat of his heir,
Arthur Henderson, in the 1931 election.</p>

<p>The issue of foreign policy came to a head at the 1935 party
conference, which coincided with Mussolini&#8217;s attack on Abyssinia.
The conference had before it an executive resolution pledging &#8216;firm
support of any action consistent with the principles and statutes of
the League [of Nations], to restrain the Italian Government and to
uphold the authority of the League in enforcing peace&#8217;. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a></p>

<p>As a Christian pacifist, Lansbury&#8217;s opposition to fascism took
the form of turning the other cheek. Abyssinia was wrong to resist
the Italians. &#8216;If mine was the only voice in the conference, I
would say in the name of the faith I hold, the belief I have that God
intended us to live peaceably and quietly with one another &#8211; if
some people do not allow us to do so, I am ready to stand as the
early Christians did and say, &#8220;This is our fate, this is where we
stand and it necessary, this is where we will die&#8221;.&#8217; <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a></p>

<p>This was followed by Ernest Bevin, who attacked Lansbury savagely.
He accused him of &#8216;hawking your conscience around from body to body
asking to be told what you ought to do with it.&#8217; The resolution was
carried overwhelmingly, by 2,168,000 votes to 102,000. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a>
Since the alternative to the traditional policy of supporting the
capitalist state was Lansbury&#8217;s impractical pacifism, there was no
real contest. Lansbury resigned from the leadership and was replaced
by Attlee.</p>

<p>Lansbury&#8217;s Christian pacifism was symptomatic of the
intellectual dependence of Labour leaders on conservative ideas, and
is therefore worth expanding on. His solution to the approaching war was:</p>

<p class="quoteb">An international conference of the Heads of States ... to
provide funds for investment in backward areas, to stabilise
currencies, to lower tariffs, and so set going again the wheels of
industry all over the world. The sacrifices would be almost nil; the
reward would be such a prosperity that no nation would be driven by
despair into war-like preparations.</p>

<p class="fst">Lansbury decided to act on this suggestion. He visited the
conventional statesmen and the unconventional ones, his travels
including a meeting with Hitler which he described as &#8216;a triumph&#8217;.
&#8216;He <em>will</em> not go to war unless pushed by others,&#8217; wrote
Lansbury, describing Hitler publicly as &#8216;one of the greatest men of
our time&#8217;. Privately he described him as a distressed and lonely
man. Lansbury believed quite honestly that if he had been able to
speak German and could have stayed with the Fuhrer a short while at
his country retreat in Berchtesgaden he could have calmed him and
perhaps converted him to &#8216;Christianity in its purest sense&#8217;.
After this the warm reception he got from Mussolini caused no sensation.</p>

<p>Lansbury&#8217;s later visits included Dr Schushnigg, the dictator of
Austria, King Carol and his &#8216;patriarch-premier&#8217;, Myron Christen
in Romania, and the butcher of Hungary, Admiral Horthy. All these
dictators enthusiastically desired a Christian peace. At the time of
the Munich Agreement, when Chamberlain returned from his meeting with
Hitler waving a piece of paper and declaring it meant &#8216;peace in our
time&#8217;, Lansbury was one of his ardent supporters. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to think of any other working-class party in the
world that could produce a leader with the muddleheadedness and
reactionary ideas of Lansbury.</p>

<p>After Abyssinia another crisis in foreign affairs faced the Labour
leaders &#8211; the civil war in Spain. Franco launched this in June 1936
against the recently elected Popular Front government It became at
once a central issue facing the working class movement.</p>

<p>The British government, in association with other leading powers,
advocated &#8216;non-intervention&#8217;, which was supposed to mean an
agreement not to supply arms to the combatants on either side. In
fact behind the screen of &#8216;non-intervention&#8217; the Germans and
Italians sent planes and supplies to help Franco. Later the Italians
even sent whole armies to Spain.</p>

<p>At the Labour Party Conference in October 1936 the main argument
used by the supporters of &#8216;non-intervention&#8217; was the fact that it
was advocated by the French Popular Front government. There was not a
word about the pressure the British government exerted on the French
to adopt non-intervention; not a word of criticism of the
spinelessness of the French Socialist prime minister Leon Blum in the
face of British pressure.</p>

<p>In the conference debate Aneurin Bevan exposed the fraud of non-intervention:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Is it not obvious to everyone that if the arms continue
to pour in to the rebels in Spain, our Spanish comrades will be
slaughtered by hundreds of thousands? Has Mr Bevin and the National
Council considered the fate of the Blum Government if a Fascist
Government is established in Spain? How long will French democracy
stand against Fascism in Germany, Fascism in Italy, Fascism in Spain
and Fascism in Portugal? <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Support for non-intervention was carried by 1,836,000 votes to 519,000.</p>

<p>Although doubts about the wisdom of this policy grew, the Labour
Party did not go beyond passive protest. True, the following year&#8217;s
Labour Conference decided unanimously to oppose non-intervention,
<a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a> but this led to nothing more than
a few speeches in parliament, not the organisation of mass movements
in the streets, factories or mines.</p>

<p>To salve their consciences the Labour leaders organised relief
measures and Red Cross services for the Spanish Republicans. But even
this was done on a miserable scale. Thus the 1937 Labour Party
conference was informed that from 1 August 1936 to mid-July 1937
&#163;126,000 was collected for the International Solidarity Fund. The
British trade unions contributed &#163;37,000 of this. <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a>
Two years later the 1939 conference was told by the national
executive that &#8216;approximately &#163;53,000 had been raised by the
National Council of Labour in the country for the International Fund&#8217;. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The left alternative</h4>

<p class="fst">If the Labour leadership&#8217;s record on foreign policy was summed
up by its appalling abandonment of Republican Spain, the left at
least began with quite a distinct and radical policy. Thus Cripps&#8217;
<strong>Can Socialism come by Constitutional Means?</strong> included a chapter
entitled: <em>Permanent Peace Impossible with Capitalism</em>. In 1933
the Socialist League won executive acceptance of discussions as to
&#8216;what steps, including a general strike, are to be taken to
organise the opposition of the organised working-class movements in
the event of war or threat of war.&#8217; <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>

<p>Once the tide turned against the League, however, this decision
became meaningless and within a year the Labour Party openly and
completely repudiated the resolution on the general strike and war.</p>

<p>Argument also raged over the League of Nations. A 1934 Labour
statement on <strong>War and Peace</strong> took a strong line in support of
the League of Nations and proposed a &#8216;Peace Pact&#8217; to embody the
obligations derived from the League Covenant. <strong>War and Peace</strong>
wanted &#8216;to abolish all national armed forces maintained for the
purpose of self-defence against other nations&#8217;, and to substitute
&#8216;the international police force under the League&#8217;s authority.&#8217;</p>

<p>At the 1934 conference the Socialist League had denounced the
League of Nations as indissolubly bound up with the Treaty of
Versailles, which had concluded the First World War, and as a
defender of the <em>status quo</em>. &#8216;The League of Nations
inevitably reflects the economic conflicts of the capitalist system
[and] cannot end war.&#8217; Instead a Labour Government should &#8216;seek
to establish the closest political and economic relations with the
Soviet Union and with all other countries where Socialist Governments
are in control.&#8217; In 1933 this might have passed. In 1934 it stood
no chance, gaining 269,000 against the right&#8217;s 1,953,000. <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a></p>

<p>Another issue was a united front against fascism. In January 1933
Hitler came to power. In February 1934 the executive of the Second
(Socialist) International declared the need for united working-class
resistance to fascism and its readiness for common action with the
Comintern. The latter responded with a call to Communist Parties in
each country to seek to convene a conference to form a united front.
The Communist Party of Great Britain there-upon approached the Labour
Party, the TUC and the Co-operative Party on the question. The ILP
also issued an appeal for a united front, and in March arrived at
general agreement with the Communist Party to bring it about.</p>

<p>What was the reaction of the Labour leaders? The Labour National
Joint Council declined the proposal of the Communist Party and ILP,
and issued a manifesto, <strong>Democracy <em>versus</em> Dictatorship</strong>, in
which it coupled a denunciation of Nazi dictatorship in Germany with
Communist dictatorship in the Soviet Union, and argued that Nazism
was a reaction to the dictatorial &#8216;reaction of the Left&#8217;. It said
in effect that Nazism and Communism were much the same, and so
rejected any notion of a united front.</p>

<p>The Labour Party executive adopted strong measures against bodies
influenced by the Communist Party&#8217;s call for a united front and
issued a general circular urging its affiliates to have no dealings
with such bodies. It also published a pamphlet, <strong>The Communist
Solar System</strong>, which aimed to expose the tactics of the Communist
Party in working through front organisations.</p>

<p>At the 1934 Labour Party conference Ernest Bevin argued that the
activities of the Communists had brought about the fascist menace:
&#8216;... if you do not keep down the Communists you cannot keep down
the Fascists.&#8217; <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a> The Left was
badly routed. The vote was 1,820,000 against the united front, and
89,000 for. <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a></p>

<p>Although the united front was far better than the Labour
Leadership&#8217;s do-nothing attitude, there were difficulties with it.
The Labour left sought the united front as a means of utilising the
Communist Party&#8217;s connections with workers. The Communist Party, on
the other hand, wanted the Labour left leaders for its own purposes.
For a time the marriage of convenience held. It was helped by the
fact that the two parties shared a common view of the united front,
seeing it as largely parliamentary. This was miles away from the
concept of the united front put forward by Lenin and Trotsky.
Trotsky&#8217;s words on the united front were a book closed with seven
seals to them, when he wrote: &#8216;The united front opens up numerous
but nothing more. In itself, the united front decides nothing. Only
the struggle of the masses decides.&#8217; <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a></p>

<p>At the 1936 Labour Conference the proposal for a united front was
lost by 1,805,000 to 435,000. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a> A
few months later, in January 1937 the Communist Party, ILP and
Socialist League signed a <em>Unity Manifesto</em> calling for &#8216;Unity
in the struggle against Fascism, Reaction and War, and against the
National Government ... in the struggle for immediate demands and the
return of a Labour Government, as the next stage in the advance to
working-class power.&#8217; The Labour Party executive reacted at once
with a statement on &#8216;Party Loyalty&#8217; which reiterated conference&#8217;s
decision making united action with the Communist Party &#8216;incompatible
with membership of the Labour Party&#8217;.</p>

<p>In January the executive disaffiliated the Socialist League, after
attempts at delaying action had been lost by fourteen votes to nine.
Ernest Bevin was in a nasty mood: &#8216;I saw Mosley come into the
Labour Movement and I see no difference in the tactics of Mosley and
Cripps.&#8217; <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a> Soon membership of the
Socialist League was made incompatible with membership of the Labour
Party. <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a></p>

<p>The Socialist League faced an impossible position. First, not all
its members solidly supported the Unity Manifesto. Its specially
convened conference had voted by 56 delegates for, 38 against, with
23 abstentions. <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a> Secondly, and
above all, the <em>raison d&#8217;etre</em> of the League was its being
part and parcel of the Labour Party. Membership of the League was
confined to Labour Party members; its first rule stated that &#8216;all
members are expected to become individual members of their
Constituency Labour Parties.&#8217;</p>

<p>So the League had little alternative but to disband, doing so at
its Whitsun conference in 1937. It decided:</p>

<p class="quoteb">This conference ... having determined to do its utmost to
prevent any splits or breakaways from the Labour movement, is
prepared to sacrifice its own organisation rather than allow its
continued separate existence to be made an excuse for further
disunity in the ranks of the workers. <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the meantime, the Unity Campaign Committee continued an active
propaganda campaign of meetings throughout the country, first under
the auspices of the three bodies, the Communist Party, ILP and
Socialist League, and then of only the first two, with the
participation of some ex-Leaguers as individuals. In addition,
ex-Leaguers formed a &#8216;Committee of Party Members Sympathetic to
Unity&#8217; which carried on a separate campaign of its own. Michael
Foot remembers the meetings organised were &#8216;on a scale that dwarfed
anything known for years.&#8217; <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a></p>

<p>The Labour Party executive duly banned the &#8216;Committee of Party
Members Sympathetic to Unity&#8217;, and prohibited any members from
campaigning for the cause of unity with the Communists and the ILP. A
number of affiliated organisations sent in resolutions for annual
conference on the united front and the position of the Socialist
League, but the executive used its power to disallow all of them.</p>

<p>The only way to get round this was by reference back of the
executive report. Cripps, who moved the reference back, pointed out
that the ban imposed on association with the Communist Party and ILP
was &#8216;not extended to those who associated themselves with members
of opposing capitalist parties.&#8217; Harold Laski, seconding, said that
if he had to choose between appearing on the same platform with
Winston Churchill or Harry Pollitt, he had no doubt at all that his
proper place was with Pollitt. In the debate Herbert Morrison used
the disarray between the Communist Party, ILP and Labour Left most effectively:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I understand Sir Stafford to say that you must never
appear with well-to-do persons on a platform, or a person of another
Party, and that you ought to appear on a platform only with working
class representatives ... Would Mr Pollitt appear on a platform with
Socialist, working-class Trotsky? He would not. If some of the
leaders of the POUM in Spain and a working-class Party came to London
and the ILP wanted another united front platform with them and Mr
Pollitt, Mr Pollitt would not appear. But Mr Pollitt will appear with
the Duchess of Atholl. <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Two votes were taken, one on the issue of banning the Socialist
League, the other on the executive&#8217;s action on the united front. In
both cases the reference back was heavily defeated. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a>
Even among constituency delegates no more than one vote in three was
cast for the united front. <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a> But the
left was still not completely on its back. In the elections to the
executive Pritt, Laski and Cripps were among the seven elected for
the constituencies, while Ellen Wilkinson secured her place in the
women&#8217;s section.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Sliding towards the Popular Front</h4>

<p class="fst">Although the demand for an &#8216;Anti-Fascist Front&#8217; had its
problems, at least it called for working-class unity. Despite the
movements parliamentary emphasis, its class character still had some
role. However, the Labour left abandoned even this position. Events
were precipitated by the foreign minister, Anthony Eden, who resigned
over government appeasement of Germany after Hitler&#8217;s annexation of Austria.</p>

<p>In the same month that Austria was occupied, March 1938, the
Communist Party&#8217;s <strong>Daily Worker</strong> called for the formation of a
&#8216;Peace Bloc&#8217; headed by Winston Churchill. The party was slavishly
following orders from Moscow.</p>

<p>Cripps, who at that time still opposed co-operation with
capitalist elements, executed a complete somersault. Within three
weeks he was preaching the Popular Front. It was &#8216;necessary to
reconsider one&#8217;s opinions and decisions in the light of changing
events,&#8217; he said. <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a> An example of
his &#8216;reconsidered opinion&#8217; was his presiding over a rally for
Spain which included speakers such as the Duchess of Atholl, a
Conservative MP, Harry Pollitt of the Communist Party and D.N. Pritt.</p>

<p>The new line consisted of calling for a Popular Front. This meant
workers allying with openly capitalist forces in the widest possible
coalition of anti-government organisations. The object was to topple
prime minister Chamberlain, stop appeasement and curb the
expansionism of Hitler and Mussolini.</p>

<p>The &#8216;anti-government&#8217; elements which were supposed to combat
fascism included people like Winston Churchill, the arch reactionary
of 1926 and a man who uttered admiring statements about Mussolini&#8217;s
Italy. Popular Front supporters ignored the fact that politicians
like Churchill or Eden opposed appeasement not because they stood for
the rights of small nations or workers&#8217; freedom to organise, but
solely because they were concerned with a militant defence of British imperialism.</p>

<p>The new policy had catastrophic implications. Fascism had no
respect for passive paper alliances. If the working class was to
defeat fascism, it had to mobilise its economic, political and
physical might. This was precisely what the Popular Front prevented.
The price of the alliance with the &#8216;democratic bourgeoisie&#8217; was
the undermining of independent working-class struggle. The
politicians who had stood by and watched the Spanish workers defeated
by Franco were now expected to take the helm in the anti-fascist struggle.</p>

<p>The transition from the united front to the Popular Front was
rapid but not always smooth. The ILP repudiated the turn towards the
Popular Front and broke with the Communist Party and Labour left. But
the ILP was a wasting force, both in numbers and political direction.
Though it had left the Labour Party in 1932 it wanted to remain a
left reformist organisation. This did not fit the situation at all.
It was neither a serious alternative to Labour, nor did it have the
authority of Russia behind it as the Communist Party did. In the face
of the crisis posed by fascism it was crushed between these two millstones.</p>

<p>William Mellor, editor of <strong>Tribune</strong>, was shocked by the fact
that with practically no internal discussion, Cripps and his friends
on the Labour left could move from the united front to the Popular
Front, from advocating the overthrow of capitalism as a prerequisite
for peace to favouring class collaboration in order to oppose
fascism. When Mellor, refused to swallow the new line he was removed
unceremoniously from the editor&#8217;s chair without one word of
explanation. The change from united front to Popular Front was
settled behind the scenes. Suddenly <strong>Tribune</strong> announced: &#8216;Today
we have a Government of national capitulation. We must replace it
with a Government of national regeneration.&#8217; <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a></p>

<p>In the Labour Party the right-wing foreign policy of the Popular
Front had no more success than the united front, a left-wing foreign
policy. The labour bureaucracy was at this stage no more willing to
sink its independence into an alliance with the capitalist class than
it was prepared to stimulate grassroots activity against it. The
issue of class and nation had still not been posed sharply enough. It
was the war that led the labour bureaucracy to make its usual
response to crisis &#8211; rushing to the defence of the capitalist <em>status quo.</em></p>

<p>In January 1939 Cripps sent a memorandum to the secretary of the
Labour Party, calling for a Popular Front open to every opposition
group. At the executive Cripps&#8217; proposal was defeated by 17 votes
to 3. (The three who voted for the memorandum were Cripps, Wilkinson
and Pritt). <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a></p>

<p>Cripps&#8217; boomerang from class politics to an all-class alliance
was ridiculed by Attlee. He was bemused by the &#8216;remarkable&#8217; turn
from &#8216;the advocacy of a rigid and exclusive unity of the working
classes to a demand for an alliance with capitalists, and from
insistence on the need for a Government carrying out a Socialist
policy to an appeal to put Socialism in cold storage for the duration
of the international crisis.&#8217; Attlee penned this scurrilous verse:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The people&#8217;s flag is palest pink.<br/>
It is not red blood but only ink.<br/>
It is supported now by Douglas Cole<br/>
Who plays each year a different role.<br/>
Now raise our palace standard high<br/>
Wash out each trace of purple dye,<br/>
Let Liberals join and Tories too<br/>
And Socialists of every hue. <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a></p>

<p class="fst">After the executive rejected Cripps&#8217; memorandum he circulated it
widely under the auspices of an <em>ad hoc</em> National Petition
Committee. The executive took strong objection to his action, and
demanded that Cripps withdraw the memorandum. He refused and the
executive expelled him by 13 votes to 11. <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a></p>

<p>Despite protest in the Labour ranks the May 1939 Labour Conference
confirmed Cripps&#8217; expulsion by 2,100,000 votes to 402,000 <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a>
and rejected the Popular Front by 2,360,000 to 248,000. <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a>
Cripps had not even rallied the constituency vote. More than
three-fifths of the constituency delegates apparently voted against
him on the expulsion issue, and fewer than one in six backed the
Popular Front. <a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a> <a href="#nd" name="fd">[4*]</a></p>

<p>Expulsion did not stop with Cripps. At the end of March the
executive expelled Bevan, Strauss, Trevelyan and a number of others
who refused to withdraw their support from Cripps&#8217; campaign. <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a>
Bevan came under pressure from the executive of the Miners&#8217;
Federation to accept the conditions laid down by the Labour Party
executive and seek readmission. This he did in December 1939, and was accepted.</p>

<p>The extraordinary contortions that the Labour left achieved showed
how completely disoriented and fuzzy was their thought. Lacking any
theoretical foundations, revolutionary traditions or clear programme,
the Labour left disintegrated in the fever of the threatening war.</p>

<p>Yet another acrobatic feat was performed by the Labour left when
Britain entered the war in late 1939. The Hitler-Stalin pact in
August completed the political transition to support for a war which
not so long before it had vowed to oppose. Once more <strong>Tribune</strong>&#8217;s
editor was the sacrificial lamb. H.J. Hartshorn, who stuck closely to
the Communist Party line, and had got his job just for that reason in
1938, was unceremoniously kicked out. Again <strong>Tribune</strong> did not
explain. With the Russian attack on Finland in November, the paper
abruptly became a vociferous opponent of Russia and the Communist
Party. Thus an editorial on the attack stated: &#8216;It is useless to
conceal from ourselves that this action of the Soviet Union has
profoundly shocked Socialist opinion throughout the world. The
diplomatic preparation for the invasion smelt more of <strong>Mein Kampf</strong>
than of the <strong>Communist Manifesto</strong>.&#8217; <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a>
In the stampede towards nationalism, former principles were trampled
underfoot. In 1933 the Socialist League had resolved:</p>

<p class="quoteb">that war between nations arises directly from the
necessities of capitalism and imperialism, [we] pledge ourselves
neither to fight nor in any way actively to help in such a war, nor
to support any policies or actions that put the interests of a
miscalled patriotism before those of the workers throughout the
world. <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The League&#8217;s 1935 conference reiterated: &#8216;the Movement must
declare that under no circumstances will it assist in a war waged
under capitalist rule&#8217;. <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a></p>

<p>But for the Labour left the four years that separated 1935 from
1939 were &#8216;a very long time in politics&#8217;. Trotsky said that the
revolutionary party is the memory of the class. Cripps and his
friends suffered from amnesia and were now beating the war drum as
enthusiastically as anyone.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Disciplining the youth</h4>

<p class="fst">Time and again, the Labour Party leadership has conflicted with
its various youth movements. Labour&#8217;s youth movements are classic
examples of activism without power. Youthful energy is handy when
canvassing, but since young people do not have the vote, and tend
anyway to &#8216;extremism&#8217;, they should &#8216;be seen but not heard&#8217;.</p>

<p>In the 1930s the Labour Party League of Youth was officially described as</p>

<p class="quoteb">an integral section of the Labour Party organisation
[but] it does not deal with questions of Party policy. The Annual
Conference of the Party alone deals with these. The League of Youth
activities should be mainly recreational and educational. <a href="#n83" name="f83">[83]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was an impressive organisation with more than 15,000 members.
Its conferences repeatedly asked for the right to discuss party
policies. The executive consistently refused. The 1936 Conference of
the League of Youth</p>

<p class="quoteb">demanded complete freedom for <strong>The New Nation</strong> [the
Youth monthly], including the right to use the paper to criticise
Party policy; demanded the right to reach decisions upon policy
matters and to give full publicity to decisions reached without any
regard to decisions already reached by Party Conference; asked that
the Advisory Committee should be given Executive powers and not be
responsible to the National Executive Committee; and passed a
resolution in support of a &#8216;United Front&#8217; of all working-class
Youth Organisations. <a href="#n84" name="f84">[84]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Only one delegate in the League of Youth Conference supported the
stance of the party executive. <a href="#n85" name="f85">[85]</a></p>

<p>The reaction of the executive was swift and harsh:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The National Executive Committee have ... decided to:

<blockquote>
<p class="quoteb">a) disband the National Advisory Committee of the League
of Youth;</p>

<p class="quoteb">b) not to convene the Annual Conference of the League
next Easter;</p>

<p class="quoteb">c) suspend publication of <strong>The New Nation</strong>. <a href="#n86" name="f86">[86]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="fst">But the resistance continued, so the 1937 party conference decided
to remove the youth representative from the executive. <a href="#n87" name="f87">[87]</a></p>

<p>In 1939 trouble started all over again. The executive alleged that
the League of Youth&#8217;s National Advisory Committee was again
exceeding its function. Its secretary, Ted Willis, had committed the
heinous crime of &#8216;condemning the National Executive Committee and
supporting Sir Stafford Cripps&#8217;s Popular Front Campaign ...&#8217; <a href="#n88" name="f88">[88]</a></p>

<p>If the youth demanded they be heard, Labour decided they would not
be seen. In March the party executive wound up the League&#8217;s
National Advisory Committee, disbanded its local committees,
cancelled its conference and closed down its paper, now renamed
<strong>Advance</strong>, even though &#8211; or perhaps because &#8211; its
circulation had recently risen from 9,000 to 15,000. <a href="#n89" name="f89">[89]</a>
It is not accidental that the same meeting of the executive which
passed these draconian measures was the same one that expelled Cripps
from the Labour Party.</p>

<p>Right-wing Labour repels the youth. The conservative bureaucracy
of the Labour Party always tries to stifle its youth movement, which
reflects the hopes, aspirations and impatience of the young. As it
was in the 1930s, so it has been in the 1980s, when the crushing of
the left includes the breaking of Labour&#8217;s youth organisations.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p class="fst">The change that the Labour Party underwent in the immediate
aftermath of the 1931 debacle and the radicalisation of the Labour
Left in the following years were practically restricted to
resolutions and speeches. Fine oratory at Westminster and in
conferences was accompanied by no action outside at all. The left
leaders shone as public speakers, but not as organisers of workers in
struggle. Ultimately they proved unable to break with Labour&#8217;s
right-wing leadership, because that would have meant rejecting
precisely those elements in the situation that gave them personal
prominence. So they were unwilling, even resentful prisoners of the
parliamentary right which in a bloc with the trade union bureaucracy,
controlled the Labour Party.</p>

<p>On the face of it. Labour seems capable of great transformations.
Because it is based on a combination of two incompatible elements,
class and nation, it can dramatically switch emphasis from one to the
other. An important factor in this is whether Labour is in office or
not. Thus as a governing party from 1929&#8211;31 it acted as the loyal
manager of capitalism; when it was hurled into opposition it was for
a couple of years intoxicated with revolutionary rhetoric. This
apparent instability, however, conceals a rock-hard and consistent
trend which is impervious to change because it is bound up with the
fixed social interests of a particular group &#8211; the labour
bureaucracy. It might seem that there was nothing in common between
MacDonald and Bevan, or indeed between Cripps in 1932 and Cripps the
&#8216;Chancellor of Austerity&#8217; in the 1945 Labour government after the
war, but surface appearances are in these cases highly misleading.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#fa" name="na">1*.</a> The agenda of the important 1937
Socialist League conference contained twelve motions and nineteen
amendments, only one of which was moved by a branch from outside
London. The historian of the League, Patrick Seyd, drew the
conclusion: &#8216;the Socialist League, notwithstanding its national
structure, followed a pattern which has since prevailed for most
Labour left factions, namely, of being London-based with little
organisation elsewhere. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fb" name="nb">2*.</a> The policy decisions of the 1932
conference favoured the left. Few noticed that the elections to the
national executive failed to reflect this trend. The right-wingers
Dalton and Morrison were easily returned for the constituency
section, while Frank Wise and Clem Atlee trailed far behind. (Until
1937 the whole conference, including the trade unions, voted for the
constituency section.)</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fc" name="nc">3*.</a> It should be remembered that the
Webbs themselves renounced the &#8216;inevitability of gradualness&#8217; in
the wake of the 1931 crisis and became ardent supporters of Stalin
and all his works.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#fd" name="nd">4*.</a> Outside the Labour Party Cripps
indulged in general politicking: he tried to convince individual Tory
leaders to join forces against Chamberlain and establish a government
of <em>all</em> parties. On 28 June 1939 he wrote in his diary: &#8216;I
had an hour with Oliver Stanley [a Conservative MP] and completely
convinced him of the urgent need of an all-in Government. I told him
who I had already seen and begged him to start doing something.&#8217;
<a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a> Cripps approached Churchill,
Baldwin and Halifax, who was at the time foreign secretary in the
Chamberlain government.</p>
