<p class="fst">A.J. Cook was the burning flame of the seven-month long bitter and
heroic struggle of the miners in 1926. He was the most vilified trade
union leader in the history of Britain and by far the most popular
leader the miners had had. Imbued with deep attachment to his class,
Cook was able to touch the profound feelings and aspirations of his
audience.</p>
<p>Arthur Horner, himself quite an effective speaker with a
significant influence among South Wales miners, could write the
following about Cook:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>In the months before the 1926 strike, and during the
strike, we spoke together at meetings all over the country. We had
audiences, mostly of miners, running into thousands. Usually I was
put on first. I would make a good, logical speech, and the audience
would listen quietly, but without any wild enthusiasm. Then Cook
would take the platform. Often he was tired, hoarse and sometimes
almost inarticulate. But he would electrify the meeting. They would
applaud and nod their heads in agreement when he said the most
obvious things. For a long time I was puzzled, and then one night I
realised why it was. I was speaking to the meeting. Cook was speaking
for the meeting. He was expressing the thoughts of his audience, I
was trying to persuade them. He was the burning expression of their
anger at the iniquities which they were suffering.</i> <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>
<p class="fst">Cook always appealed to the best in the miners &#8211; to their
loyalty to their mates, to their community, to their class, their
readiness to sacrifice, their deep pride. Thus one month before the
miners&#8217; resistance collapsed, on 23 October 1926, Cook wrote:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>These are epic days. We of this generation shall be
remembered in spite of ourselves. We are confronted with a crisis far
greater than that of 1914. The triumph of coal owners will be the
prelude to national ruin.</i> <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>
<p class="fst">One of the best things he saw and appealed to was the change in
the women, their heroic sacrifice and their determination. On 2 July
1926. he wrote: &#8216;I have been through the great coalfield of Durham,
Yorkshire and Notts, and I am astonished by the spirit I find there.
The women are especially wonderful. I think they are even greater
heroes than the men.&#8217; <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> And in an
article on 28 August after describing how scabbing had been stopped
in Derbyshire and the number of scabs cut back, he wrote:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>I put my faith to the women of these coalfields. I
cannot pay them too high a tribute. They are canvassing from door to
door in the villages where some of the men had signed on. The police
take the blacklegs to the pits, but the women bring them home. The
women shame these men out of scabbing. The women of Notts and Derby
have broken the coal owners. Every worker owes them a debt of
fraternal gratitude.</i> <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>
<p class="fst">A week before the collapse of the miners&#8217; resistance. Cook
wrote: &#8216;I wish to see a Women&#8217;s Section of the Miners&#8217;
Federation of Great Britain. The greatest feature of all this
struggle has been the amazing loyalty and activity of the rank and
file and the great work of the men and women in the local committees,
the boot retiring shops, and the relief committees in every district
...&#8217; <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Cook was loved and admired by the miners and their families. Ellen
Wilkinson, at the time a left-wing Labour MP, said in an interview:
&#8216;In thousands of homes all over the country, and particularly
miners&#8217; homes, there is hanging today, in the place of honour, the
picture of A.J. Cook. He is without a shadow of a doubt the hero of
the working women.&#8217; <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> Another woman,
Mrs. Adamson, wife of an extreme right-wing MP, went even further:
&#8216;Cook is trusted implicitly. The malicious attacks of the
capitalist press only served to strengthen the loyalty the miners and
their wives feel to him.&#8217; <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>
<p>However, the intimacy, the closeness of Cook to the miners was
flawed. Again and again, under difficult circumstances in the
struggle, cleavages would appear between Cook and the rank and file
he so loved. This is the essence of the tragedy of A.J. Cook.</p>
<p>Working-class history is not free from tragedy. Individuals have
been broken by the juggernaut of history. Cook was not the first or
last workers&#8217; leader to be beaten. The fate of Rosa Luxemburg or
Leon Trotsky, not to speak of the thousands of Communards or the
workers of Spain, Chile or South Africa, was in no way easier than
that of Cook. The real tragedy of Cook is not that he was beaten when
the miners were brought to their knees in 1926, but that he
disintegrated, losing his way completely at the end of his life.</p>
<p>This was not only a product of objective circumstances, but of
subjective conditions too, above all his syndicalism with which we
deal later on. Cook&#8217;s strength as the authentic voice of the miners
as a whole became his weakness: had he been a consistent Marxist-Leninist, his voice should have been the voice of the vanguard, not
the miners as a whole.</p>
<p>Cook was a militant and revolutionary workers&#8217; leader. He was
sincere in his belief that he was a Marxist. Thus, when standing for
election as Secretary of the Miners&#8217; Federation of Great Britain
(MFGB) in March 1924, Cook wrote in his <i>Address</i>: &#8216;I am proud
to be a disciple of Karl Marx and a humble follower of Lenin.&#8217;
However he had a serious deficiency in his thoughts and actions: he
was not a consistent follower of Marx or Lenin. He was very much a
revolutionary syndicalist.</p>
<p>Throughout his early life as a miner and his involvement in mining
activities, Cook was influenced by the militant syndicalists of the
South Wales Miners&#8217; Federation (SWMF).</p>
<p>Cook, born in Wookey, Somerset, on 22 November 1883, spent his
youth as a farm labourer in the heart of the West Country. In 1900,
barely past his seventeenth birthday, he moved to South Wales and
became a miner. For a number of years he was a member of the
Salvation Army and active as a Baptist lay preacher. Having been
disillusioned with the Baptist failure to promote an improvement in
social conditions, he was converted to socialism and in 1905 joined
the ILP. A year or so later he became an elected official of his
lodge in Rhondda No.&nbsp;1 District. Between 1906 and 1918 he was to
hold at different times the position of Chairman, Secretary and
President.</p>
<p>Many Rhondda syndicalists were members of the ILP: Noah Ablett was
a leading member of the ILP in 1906, so were W.H. Mainwaring, George
Dolling and many other prominent miner syndicalists. This rise of
syndicalism among the South Wales miners was part, and a significant
part, of the &#8216;labour unrest&#8217; of 1913&#8211;14. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Meetings of what subsequently became the Unofficial Reform
Committee (URC) began in May 1911. The URC was established towards
the end of the Cambrian Combine Strike, a strike that went on from
November 1910 to August 1911. At its peak it involved around 30,000
men. A most important feature of this strike was its unofficial
character. This arose because the leadership of the SWMF refused to
abandon existing policies of conciliation as a means of settling
disputes. This strike was the prologue to the first ever national
miners&#8217; strike of March 1912, which lasted for four weeks. The
issue in the national miners&#8217; strike was that of a minimum wage for
miners. It was an official strike&#8211;but overwhelmingly the result of
pressure from the rank and file. The URC played a crucial role in the
events of 1911 and 1912. As a matter of fact, throughout 1910 to 1926
the SWMF was the most militant section of the MFGB, and in it by far
the most advanced part was the Rhondda, by a long way the largest
mining district in South Wales.</p>
<p>The influence of the URC becomes clear when one notes that already
in 1911 Noah Ablett and Noah Rees, leading spokesmen of the URC, were
elected to the SWMF Executive Council. (In 1913 Frank, Hodges and
William John of the URC joined the same body.) Cook too was a
participant in the URC from its inception.</p>
<p>Revolutionary syndicalism differs significantly from the teachings
of Marx and Lenin. Syndicalists argued that the emancipation of the
working class would he achieved by direct industrial action, and the
general strike would lead to workers&#8217; control over the economy and
society. There is no clear role here for political struggle and a
political party. Syndicalism was largely the inverse side of the coin
of reformism. Syndicalism grew out of the feeling of revulsion for
Labourism: the incorporation of the Labour Party leaders in
parliament, the failure to relate to workers&#8217; needs and day-to-day
struggles, and the incorporation of the trade union leaders in
government-sponsored conciliation machinery and the increasing
alienation between the trade union bureaucracy and the rank and file.
Syndicalism was a reaction to parliamentary politics and conciliatory
trade unionism. It was also a recoil from SDF &#8216;Marxism&#8217;. This
&#8216;Marxism&#8217; was the crude economic determinism of the Second
International, in which the collapse of capitalism was regarded as
inevitable and independent of human action. Like the Labour Party the
SDF also separated politics from the industrial struggle, and looked
down on Wage militancy and strikes.</p>
<p>However not all syndicalists were averse to political action. They
were at best not clear regarding political activity, with some
completely opposed to it and some supporting it but without the
slightest idea of the nature of this activity. Many syndicalists
identified political activity, with parliamentary activity to the
exclusion of all else. Some syndicalists did not rule out
parliamentary activity but saw it as subordinated to the
extra-parliamentary industrial movement.</p>
<p>The syndicalist movement was quite amorphous, lacking theoretical
clarity and a definite organisational structure (without branches or
a formal membership). There was no clear line of demarcation,
ideologically and organisationally, between the main syndicalist
bodies and other socialist organisations. Thus Tom Mann was a pioneer
of the 1880s and 1890s of trade union organisation, joint leader of
the 1889 dock strike, member of the SDF, subsequently National
Secretary of the ILP, and a decade or so later a leading syndicalist.
Noah Ablett, George Dolling, Frank Hodges, W.H. Mainwaring (Secretary
of the URC), A.J. Cook and others, were at one and the same time
syndicalists and members of the ILP. The Syndicalists were also
involved with another organisation&#8211;the Plebs League. In January
1909 a Plebs League was established in South Wales. Local
syndicalists like Ablett, Frank Hodges, W.F. May and Cook used this
as a broadly-based propaganda body embracing ILP branches and SWMF
lodges. By the middle of 1910, a network of about 50 Plebs League
activists had been established. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> At
the same time Ablett, Dolling, Mainwaring and Cook were also members
of the Daily Herald League, an organisation that included, besides
syndicalists, also supporters of Guild Socialism, radical Christian
Socialists, and protagonists of the diffusion of property ownership
(like Hilaire Belloc and G.K. Chesterton), i.e. it was an ideological
shambles.</p>
<p>In short, the political associations with which these syndicalists
were connected were such a mish-mash of diverse views that they could
never have acted together as a coherent political force within the
industrial struggle. No wonder, then, that Cook and other
syndicalists were forced to see this struggle in purely trade union
terms &#8211; of however militant a variety. Syndicalism&#8217;s lack of
clear theory militated against the creation of a stable, disciplined
revolutionary organisation. It confirmed negatively Lenin&#8217;s
statement that there cannot be a revolutionary movement without
revolutionary theory.</p>
<p>But still syndicalism was far nearer to revolutionary socialism,
to communism&#8211;as Lenin and Trotsky argued &#8211; than reformism.
&#8216;Pre-war revolutionary syndicalism was a Communist Party in
embryo,&#8217; wrote Trotsky on 13 July 1921. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>
&#8216;Revolutionary Syndicalism, despite its denial of a party, was
essentially nothing but an anti-parliamentary party of the working
class,&#8217; Trotsky stated at the Third Congress of the Communist
International. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>
<p>The organisation of the URC was very loose indeed. Included in it
was a hard core of unofficial leaders in the Rhondda, and their
immediate supporters in the Cambrian Combine Committee and in the
Plebs League, together with a network of contacts throughout the
coalfield who generally sympathised with it. Soon after its
foundation, the URC acquired a mouthpiece in a monthly, shortly to
become a fortnightly, the <b>Rhondda Socialist</b>. The
contradictory, amorphous nature of syndicalism, and its attitude to
politics, was clear from the start.</p>
<p>Soon after its appearance, the paper was obliged to make its
editorial policies explicit. Referring to a correspondent who had
criticised the <b>Rhondda Socialist</b> for having &#8216;no definite
policy&#8211;that it is a jumble of Syndicalism, Labourism and Socialism&#8217;
and that &#8216;these conflicting views have the effect of confusing the
workers&#8217; it stated editorially:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>Now, there are various &#8216;schools of thought&#8217; in the
Socialist Movement ... But we are, as Socialists, all united for one
objective&#8211;we all desire to abolish capitalism and establish the
Socialist State ... Naturally, we differ as to the best means of
bringing it about, and we think that it would be more than foolish
for the Rhondda Socialist to ignore this honest difference of opinion
and to dogmatise that there is only one way ...</i> <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>
<p class="fst">Alas, the <b>Rhondda Socialist</b> was itself guilty of &#8216;ignoring
this difference in opinion&#8217; by covering it over through refusing to
debate the issues to the end. It continued to be a muddled, centrist
publication, the mouthpiece of revolutionary syndicalists and
reformists alike. By far the most important publication of the URC, a
syndicalist manifesto, was <b>The Miners&#8217; Next Step</b>, published
in December 1911; its first edition of 5,000 sold out by February
1912.</p>
<p>A great number of miners participated in drafting this pamphlet.
Its authors were Noah Ablett, Noah Rees, Will Hay, George Dolling,
W.H. Mainwaring, and C.L. Gibbon. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a>
In addition hundreds of other miners, among them Cook, participated
during four or five months of discussion, in drafting and redrafting
the pamphlet.</p>
<p>The aim of <b>The Miners&#8217; Next Step</b> was to overcome
sectionalism, so that the slogan &#8216;An injury to one is an injury to
all&#8217; would not be an empty phrase: &#8216;The sectional character of
the organisation in the mining industry renders concerted action
almost impossible, and thus every section helps to hinder and often
defeat the other.&#8217; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> &#8216;It might,
and probably would be, deemed advisable to have a strike of the whole
organisation to defend one man from victimisation.&#8217; <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>
<p>The struggle for higher wages should not be separated from the
struggle against capitalism. The improvement of wages and conditions
was envisaged as a step towards the eventual taking over of the pits
by the miners.</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>That a continual agitation be carried on in favour of
increasing the minimum wage, and shortening the hours of work, until
we have extracted the whole of the employers&#8217; profits. That our
objective be, to build up an organisation, that will ultimately take
over the mining industry, and carry it on in the interest of the
workers.</i> <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>
<p class="fst">Trust in the power of the rank and file was associated in the
pamphlet with extreme opposition to <i>all</i> leadership.</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>Leadership implies power held by the leader. Without
power the leader is inept. The possession of power inevitably leads
to corruption. All leaders become corrupt, in spite of their own good
intentions. No man was ever good enough, brave enough, or strong
enough, to have such power at his disposal, as real leadership
implies ... This power of initiative, this sense of responsibility,
the self-respect which comes from expressed manhood, is taken from
the men, and consolidated in the leader. The sum of <b>their</b>
initiative, <b>their</b> responsibility, <b>their</b> self-respect
becomes his ...</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>The order and system he maintains, is based upon the
suppression of the men, from being independent thinkers into being
&#8216;the men&#8217; or &#8216;the mob&#8217; ... Sheep cannot be said to have
solidarity. In obedience to a shepherd, they will go up or down,
backwards or forwards as they are driven by him and his dogs. But
they have no solidarity, for that means unity and loyalty. Unity and
loyalty, not to an individual, or the policy of an individual, but to
an interest and a policy which is understood and worked for by all.</i>
<a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>
<p class="fst">What, if any, is the role political action should play in the
revolution? On this the pamphlet is not clear at all. As a matter of
fact, as different individuals took part in writing it, considerable
difference in emphasis between chapters show themselves. Completely
missing is an understanding of the problem of the massive unevenness
in the consciousness of workers, the fragmentation of the working
class, and the need for a revolutionary party to overcome these. The
question of the power of the capitalist state, and the need to smash
it, for which a party, as leader and organiser of insurrection is
vital, is not even touched upon.</p>
<p>Cook was inclined at the time to be against political action. In
March 1912 he presented the case for the negative in a students&#8217;
debate on whether &#8216;in the opinion of the House political action is
essential to the interests of the working class.&#8217; <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a>
In 1912, Cook left the ILP in an anti-political mood.</p>
<p>The anti-leadership concept of the URC, together with its
looseness, meant that once any of its supporters got into an official
position in the union, the URC fell into complete confusion: the
anti-leadership concept opened the door for leaders to be free from
democratic control by the rank and file.</p>
<p>The entire history of the URC was one of recurring splits between
the younger generation of militants fresh from the collieries and
those who, pursuing the aim of reorganisation, had gone into the
official apparatus. The URC was a channel upwards for rank-and-file
grievances, but it was also an escalator which carried the best
militants up the structure of the union and dropped them into the
bureaucratic mire when they reached the top.</p>
<p>Although the URC, as its name implied, was in favour of
organisation and action separate from the official machine,
unofficial strikes, for example, were never an alternative to
official ones. The URC itself organised countless strikes, but apart
from their immediate objective, the URC leaders saw them as a means
of shifting the officials in the right direction. The immediate
effect of the URC attitude was that strike committees never took on a
permanent existence apart from the lodge in the same way that
engineering strike committees had done. Thus the miners never
developed their own workers&#8217; committees. Much of the minimal
self-organisation the URC possessed was closely tied in with the
official machine.</p>
<p>Mining trade unionism was based on the unity of the workplace, the
community and the collective organisation, since the colliery, the
union lodge, and the pit village were all found in the same location.
Thus the nature of the industry discouraged the division into skilled
and unskilled trade unionism that was found in engineering. Most
organised coalminers were members of one body, the Miners&#8217;
Federation of Great Britain. The engineering industry, by contrast,
had more than 200 unions. The unit of organisation of these numerous
unions tended to be the geographical branch, not the workplace. This
was because many members were in small workshops scattered over wide
areas, and because each union organised just a section of the
workforce in any one factory.</p>
<p>In mining, because there was no split between workplace and union
branch, the grievances of the rank and file tended to be channelled
directly into the official machinery, as were the efforts of
militants. While this situation allowed for greater rank-and-file
influence <i>within</i> the union, it inhibited rank-and-file action
independent of it.</p>
<p>In engineering the union branch was poorly attended and bore
little relation to the immediate concerns of the workplace. These
were more effectively dealt with by shop stewards who, for much of
the time, had to operate independently of the official structure in
order to represent workers on day-to-day issues. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>
<p><b>The Workers&#8217; Committee</b>, by J.T. Murphy, was the clearest
exposition of the engineering shop stewards&#8217; movement. It proposed
a complete national structure which &#8211; unlike that proposed by <b>The
Miners&#8217; Next Step</b> &#8211; was an <i>alternative</i> source of
authority to the existing unions. Such a position was fully
explicable in terms of the multiplicity of engineering unions and
their craft jealousies, just as the URC&#8217;s position was fully
explicable in terms of mining.</p>
<p>Because <b>The Workers&#8217; Committee</b> was proposing an
alternative structure to the unions it had to be interested in its
own special forms of organisation. It represented a mass rebellion
against the officials and the constitution, since both of these were
seen to reinforce the sectionalism of the class and cripple it as a
fighting force.</p>
<p>For the URC the union constitution and how it could be improved to
give full control from below was the centre of their work. The
strongest organising force for them was held to be the union itself.
Of course to function as an agitational current at all, the URC had
to hold meetings. The production and distribution of propaganda
required some sort of limited centralisation, but the level of
organisation could afford to be low, since the intention was not to
substitute for the union, but to increase its <i>own</i>
centralisation. The internal life of the lodge, the regional and
national conferences were the arena wherein the clash of militants
and bureaucrats would occur.</p>
<p>The result was the loose attitude to self-organisation that ran
right through the history of the URC. The main weakness of the URC
was that it aimed to bring union leadership to heel rather than
building an alternative leadership. It was more a concept of acting
as a ginger group than as building an organisation completely
independent of the trade union machine.</p>
<p>In 1913 the SWMF Executive Council (EC) adopted aspects of URC
policies: struggle for unifying conditions throughout the coalfields,
and the abolition of anomalies between various grades left by the
Minimum Wage Act. In addition the SWMF adopted the resolution moved
by Frank Hodges, a leading member of the URC and an agent in Garw
Valley, and member of the SWMF EC to establish a Triple Alliance of
the Miners, Railwaymen and Transport Workers. These successes caused
a crisis in the URC. A number of its supporters saw no need to
continue with unofficial agitation. Those of the URC who got on to
the SWMF EC especially came to this conclusion. Thus Noah Ablett
wrote that when Hodges&#8217; resolution regarding the Triple Alliance
was accepted by the MFGB,</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>... the old order of trade unionism may be said to
have been buried. For who can deny that with the exception of the
Minimum Wage Strike, the old order was that the Federation was a kind
of shield which the workman could use to protect himself when
attacked. But now to this shield is added a weapon of attack.</i>
<a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>
<p class="fst">Other supporters of the URC &#8211; working miners &#8211; took a
completely different position, and came to the conclusion that no URC
supporter should stand for a full-time position in the union. C.L.
Gibbons attacked Noah Ablett together with the rest of the SWMF EC
for dismissing the fight for the abolition of the piece-rate system
of payment in the mines as utopian. Reviewing the career of EC
&#8216;revolutionaries&#8217;, Gibbons asserted in the <i>South Wales Worker</i>:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>They were pledged to abstain from supporting
reactionary policies; they were not to take part in the
administration of such policies; they were to keep revolutionary
policies and militant programmes to the fore; they were to force the
EC to take action along lines laid down by the militant section in
the coalfield. Have they done this? Unhesitatingly we answer &#8216;No&#8217;.
They have ceased to be revolutionary except in words.</i> <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>
<p class="fst">Given the loose, undisciplined nature of the URC, the inevitable
conclusion drawn was that revolutionaries should not seek election to
the EC of the union, but concentrate on pure propaganda. The same
conclusion was drawn by the Socialist Labour Party (SLP) regarding
standing for any union office. Union office corrupts, avoid
temptation!</p>
<p>The cleavage between the rank and file and the SWMF EC was
exacerbated by the fact that there were hardly any working miners on
this august body. Thus in 1913, out of 21 members of the SWMF EC, 14
were Miners&#8217; Agents, 6 were Checkweighers, and only one was a
working miner. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a> (The agent was the
union official, the checkweighman held a sort of half-way position
between gang-leader and shop steward.)</p>
<p>When the war broke out the political weakness of the URC led to
its complete paralysis. Not that there were no serious industrial
disputes in the South Wales coalfields: in July 1915 and 1918 in
particular, there was considerable unrest, but in neither did the URC
play a significant role.</p>
<p>The main cause of the paralysis of the URC was the split in its
ranks regarding its attitude to the war. Noah Rees, Frank Hodges and
Will John, members of the SWMF EC, supported the war and participated
in the recruitment drive.</p>
<p>George Barker and Tom Smith, two of the closest supporters of the
URC, went with the pro-war section of the EC initially, not moving to
a position critical of the war until its later phases. Even Ablett
did not make any unambiguous statement of opposition to the war until
1917; indeed, he advanced as a reason for accepting the Lloyd George
terms in July 1915, the need to assist the war effort. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>
<p>Even Cook&#8217;s attitude to the war was not overtly
anti-imperialist. Initially he was involved in protests against the
high price of food. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a> As the war
deteriorated into a bloody stalemate and the spectre of conscription
loomed, the anti-war elements became more outspoken. By the end of
1915 a Rhondda Valleys&#8217; Anti-Conscription Committee had been
established with W. Phippen as chairman and W.H. Mainwaring as one of
the secretaries. In April 1916 Cook was able to declare:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>Daily I see signs among the working class with whom I
move and work of a mighty awakening. The chloroforming pill of
patriotism is failing in its power to drag the mind and consciousness
of the worker. He is beginning to shudder at his stupidity in
allowing himself to become a party to such a catastrophe as we see
today.</i> <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>
<p class="fst">In February 1917 a mass meeting of Lewis Merthyr workers passed a
resolution &#8216;that we resist the comb-out by every means in our power
even to laying down tools.&#8217; The following month Cook made his
opinion of the war clear:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>necessary to free my class from the curse and I am no
pacifist when war enslavement of capitalism ... As a worker I have
more regard for the interests of my class than any nation. The
interests of my class are not benefited by this war, hence my
opposition.</i> <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>
<p class="fst">On the industrial-economic field there was also an awakening. The
rapidly-rising cost living due to the war shattered the industrial
peace in the coalfields. In July 1915 200,000 miners struck in South
Wales and after five days Lloyd George, Minister of Munitions,
accompanied by Walter Runciman, President of the Board of Trade, and
Arthur Henderson, arrived in Cardiff, and after 24 hours negotiations
granted the miners their claim for wage improvement. The July 1915
strike galvanised the militants, and former leaders of the URC made a
reappearance on the syndicalist platform. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>Cook was prominent in this revival: when the URC met
at the Aberystwyth Restaurant, Tonypandy, in August 1915, Cook was
delegated, along with Ablett, Mainwaring and B.R. Pryce, to draw up a
manifesto urging the reorganisation and centralisation of the SWMF,
and at the next meeting he was chairman.</i> <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>
<p class="fst">Another factor besides rising living costs added to the
aggravation among the miners. Until the end of 1916 miners were
exempt from conscription. However in January 1917 the War Office
instituted a comb-out of all unskilled men and those who had entered
the mines since 1914. In April the demands of the Western Front
forced the extension of this. In January 1915 the War Office made
known its intentions to conscript a further 50,000 miners with an
extra 50,000 to be held in reserve. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>
<p>A new spur to the anti-war movement was the Russian revolution of
February 1917. On 15 April Cook chaired a mass meeting of the Lewis
Merthyr workmen which called for a &#8216;Conference to get a resolution
passed in favour of peace negotiations&#8217;. Cook attended the Leeds
Convention of June 1917 summoned to welcome the Russian Revolution
and to support the foreign policy of the Russian Provisional
Government. In the first week of July Cook was involved with Tom
Mann, Noah Ablett and Arthur Horner in meetings at Ynyshir and Porth
(where Cook was chairman) where resolutions were passed demanding &#8216;an
immediate conference of the belligerents, to negotiate an immediate
cessation of hostilities on the lines of the <i>Russian Manifesto</i>,
of no annexations, no indemnities.&#8217; <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the anti-war position of Cook (and
Tom Mann, Noah Ablett and Arthur Horner) did not go beyond the
position of the Russian Mensheviks and SRs that was vehemently damned
by Lenin as pacifist and a cover-up for the imperialist war effort of
Russia&#8217;s Provisional Government.</p>
<p>When the URC reappeared, over the conscription issue, &#8216;it was of
some significance that ... very few of its former leaders had been
associated with it ... It reinforced the antipathy that seemed to
exist between former leaders of the URC now on the SWMF EC and the
revolutionary-inclined leadership now emerging in the districts.&#8217;
<a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> This antipathy towards the former
leaders expressed itself in the following words of two leading
anti-war rank-and-file URC people, George Dolling and Nat Watkins:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8217;<i>Today there are those in the Socialist ranks who,
having grown respectable and law-abiding, act the part of the puppy
dogs of Capitalism. Those we expect to bark like any capitalist
mongrel because we attempt to live up to the faith that is in us.
But&#8217;, they continued, addressing themselves to the former leaders
of the URC, &#8216;from you we expect better things. Act and live up to
it by writing up a line of encouragement so that this work may go
on.&#8217;</i> <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>
<p class="fst">In March 1918 Cook was arrested under the Defence of the Realm Act
and sentenced to three months&#8217; imprisonment for making speeches
likely to cause disaffection. In cross-examination Cook said he
favoured a revolution by argument, not force, but proceeded to say he
wanted the Triple Alliance to use argument with the government to
bring about the confiscation of private ownership in food
commodities, and if that failed that he would suggest a general
strike of the industries of the country. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a></p>
<p>The same woolliness, semi-pacifist definition of revolution, was
shown by Cook in a speech to the MFGB Conference some four years
later, when he said:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>I stand for revolution &#8211; some of my friends say
blood &#8211; no, revolution of thought. You must have a mental
revolution ... I do not want to fight with guns ... I believe in the
organised might of the working classes</i>. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a></p>
<p class="fst">No whiff of Marx&#8217;s words about violence being the midwife of a
new society, not a word about the need for the armed working class to
overthrow the capitalist class.</p>
<p>With the end of the war, the impact of Bolshevism became immense.
As the Home Office commented on 18 November: &#8216;since the tremendous
events of a week ago, the pacifists have been busy tearing off their
disguise, and re-appearing in their proper garb as revolutionaries.&#8217;
The Rhondda militants certainly welcomed &#8216;Bolshevism&#8217;: Noah
Ablett, in a speech at Ton Pentre which was reported verbatim to the
Home Office, stated, &#8216;I rejoice in Bolshevism; I am proud of it. We
can do the same in this country, and now that the war is over I wish
good luck to the German Bolsheviks as well. Good luck to any working
class wherever the germ of Bolshevism reigns.&#8217; <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a>
Writing many years later Cook remembered the inspiration of the
Russian revolution: &#8216;We felt that what Russia could do we could do
and must do, if the workers were ever to be freed from slavery.&#8217;
<a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>
<p>In February 1919 the South Wales Socialist Society (SWSS) was
formed, which former members of the URC now joined. The URC leaders
saw in the SWSS a coordinating centre for the activities of
industrial militants from which all political questions &#8211;
parliamentarism and relations with the Labour Party &#8211; would be
excluded. This was what Cook had in mind when he stated, in opening
the inaugural conference of the SWSS, that what was wanted was some
kind of Syndicalist Federation:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>The Society was open to all who accepted the class war
theory and the Society was to be composed of groups of trades which
would consider their own problems and receive the co-operation of the
whole in bringing about reforms in their own industries ...</i> <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>
<p class="fst">The Conference was in fact split between advocates of Cook&#8217;s
policy and those who supported political action of some sort. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a></p>
<p>The confidence of the rank and file in the year 1918, when Britain
to proletarian revolution than ever before or after, was the main
focus of <b>The Miners&#8217; Next Step</b>, that the grievance of any
member would be met with the whole strength of the Union, became a
fact. In February 1920 30,000 miners in the Rhondda struck against
the dismissal of two members, and the two were reinstated. At the end
of March 1920, 10,000 miners of the Tredegar Combine struck in
support of two miners denied payment of the minimum wage. Similarly
at the end of 1920, 45,000 struck in the Rhondda over the alleged
victimisation of 11 men. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>
<p>This high level of class solidarity was the background to the
negotiations to establish a Communist Party in Britain in which the
SWSS was now involved. The SWSS split asunder, moving in two
directions: one faction towards the Communist Party of Great Britain
that was emerging around the BSP and the Communist Unity Group; the
other faction joining the Communist Party, British Section of the
Third International (CPBSTI) around Sylvia Pankhurst. Cook joined the
latter organisation&#8211;but for largely syndicalist reasons:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>The latter&#8217;s appeal derived from its
syndicalist-inclined programme and it subsequently attracted some of
the Rhondda activists, notably A.J. Cook, Dolling and T.J. Watkins.
In September 1920 a conference was held at which ... &#8216;a dozen
ex-members of the SWSS&#8217; almost all from the Rhondda, decided to set
up a &#8216;Communist Party of South Wales&#8217;, presumably affiliated to
the CPBSTI as Whitehead, its secretary, attended and expounded its
policies at the conference. Cook and Dolling stressed the need for
the party to be &#8216;anti-political&#8217; ... At the root of this
development in South Wales lay the desire to find a form of
organisation that would express the purely industrial character of
the URC and which would not be subject to centralised political
control. For Cook in particular this remained a cardinal factor of
his outlook.</i> <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>
<p class="fst">In December 1919 Cook became a full-time union official: he won
the post of second agent to the Rhondda No.&nbsp;1 District.</p>
<p>The year 1920 saw Cook entering the mainstream of events on a
national level. His election as miners&#8217; agent gave him a seat on
the SWMF EC and hence a representative status at MFGB Conference.</p>
<p>A test for Cook, and turning point both for him and for the MFGB
was the Datum Line strike (16 October to 3 November 1920). It was so
called because under the temporary terms of settlement, the wage
advance granted was made to depend upon output reaching a given point
&#8211; the Datum Line. The settlement was to last only five months, in
which period the mine owners and miners were jointly to work at a
permanent settlement. In other words it was a truce &#8211; but a truce
that in fact benefitted the mine owners very much, as the dispute was
postponed to the summer season.</p>
<p>Cook campaigned vigorously throughout early October 1920 for
strike action against the government terms, and the miners&#8217;
rejection of these terms by a massive 453,670 majority gladdened him
&#8211; he actually seconded the resolution calling for the strike to
commence. During the strike Cook supported the URC agitation for a
seizure of the mines, and at Tonyrefail persuaded a conference of
local lodges to call for a seizure of the mines by the Triple
Alliance. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>Cook found the &#8216;Datum Line&#8217; principle abhorrent,
and he began a bitter campaign against the MFGB leadership whom he
dubbed &#8216;the lieutenants of the capitalist class&#8217; ...</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>He expressed the need for &#8216;the reorganisation of the
Federation from the bottom up, and in a potent article Cook attacked
the whole structure of working-class representation: &#8216;The MFGB,
Triple Alliance and TUC are fast becoming manufacturing centres for
resolutions, glorified state institutions earning the praise of the
capitalist class. We are led at the heels of the politicians, the
atmosphere of the House of Commons is pervading the trade union
executives. The very machine we have built up for our emancipation is
being used to crush us.&#8217;</i> <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a></p>
<p class="fst">The Datum Line agreement was to be a turning point in the miners&#8217;
struggle &#8211; a prologue to Bloody Friday, and following it, the
lockout of miners in 1926.</p>
<p>In January 1921 Cook became a representative of the SWMF on the
MFGB Executive Committee.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Revolutionary syndicalists turned bureaucrats</h4>
<p class="fst">Central to the revolutionary bureaucrats was their opposition to
the trade union bureaucracy. However, they did not understand the
basic cause of the existence of bureaucracy and its relation to the
rank and file. The bureaucracy is an <i>inevitable</i> product of the
role of trade unions under capitalism. The trade union bureaucracy is
a distinct, basically conservative, social formation. It faces both
ways, balancing between the employers and the workers. It holds back
workers&#8217; struggle from getting out of control, but it has a vital
interest not to push the collaboration with employers and state to a
point where it makes the unions completely impotent.</p>
<p>The trade union official also balances between different sections
of his own union. He keeps in check the advanced sections of the
union who are the more active and rebellious, by relying on those who
are more passive, apathetic and ignorant.</p>
<p>The official also strengthens his hold on the union by juxtaposing
it to other unions. Sectionalism helps the union official to mobilise
the backward members of his own union.</p>
<p>As only in revolutionary periods does the working class achieve
homogeneity, a bureaucracy is an inevitable product of trade
unionism. No union can exist without a bureaucracy dominating it.
Therefore even the most left person coming to head a union is bound
to be trapped into the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The syndicalists also did not understand the other side of the
coin of the unevenness in the consciousness of workers &#8211; the need
for a revolutionary party organising the vanguard of the class. The
unions are more effective, more able to fulfil their task, the larger
the mass of the membership. The revolutionary party is completely
different. The revolutionary party deserves its name if it is
ideologically homogeneous, bound by unity of action and organisation.</p>
<p>Lacking an understanding of the nature of the trade union
bureaucracy, its relation to the heterogeneity of workers&#8217;
consciousness, and the need for a revolutionary party organising the
vanguard of the class, the syndicalists failed to understand the
connection between the trade union bureaucracy and reformism.</p>
<p>Throughout the years you find again and again Cook wavering
between rank-and-file workers and the trade union bureaucracy, and
between the Communist Party and the Labour Party.</p>
<p>Following Black Friday and the three months&#8217; lockout, Cook found
himself in deep conflict with the rank and file. Cook, together with
Ablett, representing South Wales on the MFGB EC, voted to accept the
terms of settlement dictated by the owners. Many of the rank and file
thought differently. On 17 June 1921 the terms were rejected in South
Wales by 110,616 to 40,909 (and nationally by 434,614 to 180,724). At
the end of June, nevertheless, notwithstanding the ballot result, the
MFGB decided to accept the mine owners&#8217; terms and call off the
dispute. Despite the pleading of Cook and Ablett, at the SWMF
Conference nearly half the delegates voted against the agreement (112
for, 109 against). <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>
<p>The actions of Cook and Ablett bought criticism from men they
represented. Two lodges in the Rhondda No.&nbsp;1 District called for
Cook&#8217;s resignation. Once the settlement of the 1921 lockout took
place, Cook left the Communist Party. He stated that the Party was &#8216;a
hindrance to the whole of the British trade union movement ... They
are causing division inside the ranks of the whole movement, and I am
of the opinion that we shall, as a trades union movement, eventually
have to fight the Communist Party.&#8217; <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>
<p>Cook&#8217;s alignment with the MFGB EC led to a break not only with
the CP but for a whole year also with the rank-and-file militants in
the union. The defeat of the miners in 1921 strengthened the hands of
the right on the MFGB EC. Now Frank Hodges, the Secretary of the
MFGB, argued that the only way to raise wages was by co-operating
with the mine owners in raising productivity. This was agreed by the
whole EC, including Cook.</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>From the autumn of 1921 Cook was carrying out what
must be regarded as a campaign in the Rhondda for improved
productivity and harmonious relations with colliery managements. At
mass meetings in October he was urging miners to boost output by the
production of &#8216;clean&#8217; coal and the acceptance of the double shift
system hitherto strongly resisted in South Wales. These meetings were
followed up by approaches to managements with the aim of concluding
agreements to keep open marginal collieries on the basis of a
co-operative approach to productivity problems. &#8216;This
heart-to-heart discussion&#8217;, said Mr Cook, &#8216;is winning the
confidence of the men, and is resulting in a far more interested and
harmonious working.&#8217;</i> <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>
<p class="fst">Here we see a classic demonstration of the fact that while the
line of division between left and right union officials is of
importance, the cleavage between the bureaucracy and the rank and
file is of even greater consequence. Without the discipline of a
revolutionary party over the union official, however left he may be,
he is bound to move, under pressure of the union machine, away from
the rank and file.</p>
<p>The co-operation between union and management led to no
improvement in miners&#8217; wages. As a matter of fact, wages were cut
to the bone, conditions deteriorated, unemployment and non-unionism
spread widely. After a year Cook swung back, leftwards.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1922 a renewal of the rank-and-file movement
took place. In September, Cook joined S.O. Davies, Noah Ablett,
George Daggar, J. Thomas and D.L. Davies in signing a <i>Manifesto</i>
calling for the construction of an organisation to withstand the
attacks of the employers, and urging MFGB affiliation to the Red
International of Labour Unions. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a>
This was the start of a new unofficial movement, later to be named
the Minority Movement. However, this movement was radically different
from the pre-war URC or even the movement during the war and the
first year after it. In the first place, full-time union officials
played a far greater role &#8211; a central role &#8211; in the Miners&#8217;
Minority Movement. As miners were at the time on the defensive, with
the threat of victimisation over their heads, it fell to the
officials to keep the movement going. Cook summed up the sort of
relationship established between the left-wing union officials and
the rank-and-file militants:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>Many of the younger leaders ... realised that the rank
and file at the pits dare not, for fear of victimisation, express
themselves, [and] decided to make a move again, unite the advanced
movement to renew hope and confidence. Again, as in 1910, conditions
have forced men to think, and in every district a Minority Movement
is being formed, this time with the help of many of the full-time
officials, who cannot be victimised by the powerful coal magnates.</i>
<a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>
<p class="fst">The political backbone of the Miners&#8217; Minority Movement was
provided by the Communist Party. Cook was by far the most important
official associated with the MMM, its foremost leader, although he
was not a member of the CPGB.</p>
<p>The MMM was very much encouraged by changes in the economic
conditions of the mining industry in 1923. Due to the French
occupation of the German Ruhr and the cessation of production there,
a boom in British coal exports took place. The rank and file became
more confident and militant.</p>
<p>In February 1924 the SWMF Conference adopted practically the whole
programme of the MMM. Hopes rose that the MFGB would follow suit. But
that was not to be.</p>
<p>In March 1924, on a fairly high poll, Cook was elected secretary
of the MFGB. He secured 217,664 votes to his nearest rival, Joseph
Jones of Yorkshire, who received 202,297 votes.</p>
<p>The heightened militancy among the miners, together with hopes
kindled by the election of the first Labour government, led miners to
demand the ending of the 1921 wage agreement: a return to national
settlement instead of district settlement, and a general improvement
in wage levels. In December 1923 a ballot of MFGB members took place
on EC recommendation, to end the 1921 agreement: 510,303 voted for
the recommendation, and 114,558 against. Accordingly, on 17 January
1924, the EC gave three months&#8217; notice to end the agreement.
However, the newly-elected Labour government defused the situation.
On 15 April the Minister of Labour appointed a Court of Inquiry under
Lord Bookmaster, a Liberal ex-Lord Chancellor. The result: the basic
principles of the 1921 agreement &#8211; district settlement instead of
national settlement of wages &#8211; remained intact, but an improvement
in the standard of wages was granted.</p>
<p>The new agreement caused a rift between Cook and the MMM. Cook,
together with the rest of the leadership of the MFGB, supported the
agreement, while the MMM strongly rejected. It was Cook who
recommended the agreement to the May Conference of the MFGB. A
resolution to reject the agreement was moved by South Wales and
seconded by Scotland. McNallty of Scotland said:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>&#8216;It is no use humbugging yourselves, the owners know
that you are not going to fight, and have treated you accordingly in
your negotiations. I am sure that if you had put forward the same
militancy as in 1921, you would have got better terms without a
strike than you have got today.&#8217;</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>E. Williams of South Wales said: &#8216;We see no hope in
this agreement, except that we shall guarantee an average profit to
the shareholders.&#8217;</i></p>
<p class="fst">Notwithstanding the efforts of Herbert Smith, the President of the
MFGB, and A.J. Cook, the opposition to the agreement at the
Conference was quite large. 311 voted against the settlement
(including South Wales, Scotland, Lancashire and Leicester) and 473
for. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a></p>
<p>Following the MFGB Conference, the MMM called on the rank and file
to carry industrial action against the agreement. &#8216;The policy of
the militant miners must be to resist the Agreement, whether in a
majority or in a minority.&#8217; Cook, the MMM explained, allowed
himself to be swayed by the EC. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a></p>
<p>Influenced by the campaign of the MMM, the Conference of SWMF came
out against the agreement on a card vote &#8211; 87,000 against, 65,150
for.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The 1926 lockout</h4>
<p class="fst">The most important chapter in Cook&#8217;s life began on 1 May 1926,
during the seven months of the miners&#8217; lockout in 1926. He never
fought so hard, never got as much support from the miners; his life
was immersed in the struggle of the miners he so loved. And in the
support of the rank and file was Cook&#8217;s strength. He was making as
many as six speeches a day in an attempt to keep up the spirits of
the miners. He found the going more and more tough. <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a></p>
<p>One former miner remembered in 1941:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>Never were such vast crowds seen in the coalfields &#8211;
perhaps never in Britain &#8211; as that which the Miners&#8217; General
Secretary, Mr. A.J. Cook addressed. From North, South, East and West,
came the crowds &#8211; far beyond the limits of the immediate district
in which he spoke; on foot, by cycle, train, and bus the people came;
large numbers who were not miners went to swell the crowds ...</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>He got, and held, the crowds. It was unusual to have a
miners&#8217; official going through the coalfields in this way ...</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>Seldom has there been such feeling as swept the crowds
... That Mr. Cook was a subject of great devotion was undeniable. He
was a prophet among them. To this day men speak of those gatherings
with awe. That the speaker paid with his life is beyond doubt.</i>
<a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a></p>
<p class="fst">Especially great was the role of Cook in staving off the collapse
of the miners&#8217; resistance, and even reversing the trend when the
miners did go back to work. Again and again Cook held meetings at
villages where a number of miners had returned to work under the whip
of hunger, and he inspired them to come out again. He gave them the
courage to face the hunger, and the police brutality. &#8216;The
coalfield resembled a battlefield with an &#8220;army of occupation&#8221;
attempting to break the spirit of a hostile, turbulent population
...&#8217; <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a> Cook was marvellous.</p>
<p>But now in 1926, more than ever before, was the isolation, the
loneliness of Cook manifest. And this is a paradox. Cook loved the
miners, and the miners loved him. How can one speak of his isolation?</p>
<p>The tragedy of Cook was that he had no structured relations with
workers, either in his union, or even more so, with members of other
unions. He was trapped at the head of a union machine, and related to
other workers through their leadership. When &#8216;left&#8217; leaders &#8211;
people like A.B. Swales, A.A. Purcell, George Hicks &#8211; all
revolutionary syndicalists before the war, and now sympathisers of
the Minority Movement &#8211; betrayed the miners (not one of them voted
in the General Council of the TUC against calling off the General
Strike) &#8211; Cook did not denounce them. The discipline of a party was
missing &#8211; the reciprocity between rank and file and leadership, the
accountability of <i>all</i> was not there. Hence a leader of one
union &#8211; let us say Cook &#8211; can approach members of other unions
only through their leaders.</p>
<p>The bureaucrat&#8217;s attitude was demonstrated by Cook when, on 7
October 1926, at a special conference of the MFGB, he argued against
the proposal of Arthur Horner and E. Morrell to call for an embargo
on foreign coal. This is what Cook said:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>I cannot see how you can go over the heads of the
unions unless you get the unions to do it. I say here quite
definitely it is hopeless to get an official action on an embargo on
coal unless the union will operate it. You have no right to get men
out who cannot have the protection of their union ...</i> <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a></p>
<p>The efforts of individuals, not even of Cook with his confidence
in the magnificent potential of the working class, could not overcome
the unevenness and sectionalism which rends the class, which is
encouraged by the trade union bureaucracy, and which in turn nurture
it. A revolutionary party is indispensable to fight those
contradictions. The lack of a party to support Cook led him to
vacillations that sometimes bordered on capriciousness. The
revolutionary party gives one a sense of realism. Being rooted in the
class, made up of the most advanced workers, it allows elasticity and
adaptation without falling into unprincipled opportunism. Of course
struggle demands improvisation. But in order for this not to
degenerate into simple vacillation, the tactics and strategy must be
based on a sober assessment of the real forces in combat. As Lenin
repeated again and again: strategy and tactics must be based &#8216;on
exact appraisal of the objective situation.&#8217; <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a>
Strategy and tactics must take cognisance of the consciousness of the
workers. Only an organisation, a revolutionary party, makes it
possible to grasp the real workers&#8217; consciousness and to adopt
suitable tactics and strategy.</p>
<p>Isolated in the midst of the multitude of miners, Cook suffered
from continual alteration of mood, with bewildering rapidity moving
from optimism to pessimism. Actually neither the euphoria of optimism
nor the morass of pessimism are of any use. &#8216;Pessimism or optimism?
<i>Calculation of forces</i>. Sober appraisal and fervent
dedication,&#8217; writes Lenin. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a></p>
<p>Volatility in his tactics led Cook quite often to fall into the
trap of manoeuvring, which deceived the enemy less than it
embarrassed his own side. One can juxtapose an overoptimistic
statement by Cook for public consumption with a very pessimistic
statement in private. Taken together Cook sounds simply dishonest,
conflicting violently with Marx&#8217;s dictum that Communists must
always tell the workers the truth.</p>
<p>On the one hand he was declaring that 97 per cent of the recruits
for the police and armed forces &#8216;have come from the working
classes, and thousands of them miners, who will not shoot against
their kith and kin when the orders comes&#8217;. Furthermore:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>We have got the whole trade union movement in the
country pledged to defend the miners&#8217; hours, wages and national
agreements. Abroad we have made agreements that no coal shall come
into this country. The Government and the owners know we have got the
organisation that can fight and win. My last word to the Government
is, count the cost. The cost of a strike of the miners would mean the
end of capitalism.</i> <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a></p>
<p class="fst">And a bare month before the total crumbling of the miners&#8217;
resistance Cook wrote an article, the headline of which was: <i>&#8216;THE
TIDE HAS TURNED!</i> ... No time for defeatists now! ... <i>WE CAN
WIN</i> ... In the name of the dead, the living and the unborn, I say
fight on &#8211; the darkness is behind us &#8211; the dawn breaks and
victory is within our grasp.&#8217; <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a></p>
<p>Yet practically on the same day Cook sent opposite signals to Tom
Jones, deputy Secretary to the Cabinet. Thus in his diary entry for
14 April 1926, Jones wrote: wandering in the House of Commons &#8216;when
I ran into Cook. Cook turned aside and whispered to me &#8220;I&#8217;d like
to see you tonight&#8221;. I whispered back my Hampstead telephone
number.&#8217; Next day, 15 April, Cook told Jones:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>We are economically in the weakest position we have
ever been, and while a lot of our chaps won&#8217;t agree with me, we
shall have to have a national minimum not only with plusses above it
but minusses below it. I asked him what was the most helpful thing I
could do in the interests of peace. He said, to get the owners to
meet the PM as early as possible, next week, then to bring the miners
to meet them, a joint conference with the PM presiding, and to keep
them together while they thrashed out the wages issue ...</i> <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a></p>
<p class="fst">While publicly Cook never tired of repeating the slogan he coined:
&#8216;Not a penny off the pay, not a second on the day&#8217;, behind the
scenes he was involved in negotiations that contradicted it
completely. Thus on 3 July 1926 he was involved in negotiations with
F. Seebohm Rowntree (the chocolate magnate), Sir Walter Layton
(editor of <b>The Economist</b>) and F.D. Stuart (Rowntree&#8217;s
private secretary). As a result Cook signed a document which agreed:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>With a view to increasing output, and so reducing the
cost of production, the Miners&#8217; Federation:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="quoteb"><i>(a) To co-operate in a scheme to deal with voluntary
absenteeism, if necessary by penalties.</i></p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>(b) To ensure the working of the full shifts in Durham
and Northumberland.</i></p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>(c) To work double shifts in South Wales or any other
area in which it is practicable, and is desired by the owners.</i></p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>(d) To discourage any restrictions of output and
co-operate in the establishment and full utilisation of machinery to
settle any question of alleged restriction.</i></p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>(e) To assist in the extension to as many grades as
possible of the principle of piece work, or some other system of
payment by result.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="fst">In an accompanying letter Cook wrote: &#8216;... if the Government
will accept the proposals herewith put forward as an alternative to
the passing of the [8&#8211;Hours] Act <i>as a basis for discussion</i>,
the Miners&#8217; Federation will do everything they possibly can to
increase output and to develop machinery for securing peace and
goodwill.&#8217; <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a></p>
<p>The proposed deal came to nothing, but the MFGB in 1929 set up an
investigating committee which reprimanded Cook as the secret
agreement was in violation of the rules of the MFGB, being carried
out without the knowledge of the EC. J. Williams, a left-wing
delegate for the Forest of Dean, declared the 3 July 1926. document:
&#8216;... a piece of deception unprecedented in the history of Trade
Unions.&#8217; <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a> If we did not know that
Cook was neither a self-seeker nor sell-out merchant we might have
assumed that he was a hypocrite, but the simple truth was that he was
trapped.</p>
<p>One of the saddest chapters of the seven months was connected with
the <i>Bishops&#8217; Memorandum</i>.</p>
<p>On 14 July the MFGB EC had to consider the mediation proposal of a
number of church leaders. The proposal was that the miners should
resume work immediately, on the conditions that pertained prior to 30
April, that the government should grant temporary assistance pending
a national settlement to be reached within four months on the basis
of the <i>Samuel Commission Report</i>. If the negotiations failed,
an independent arbitrator should fix the award. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a>
Cook was one of the main advocates of the <i>Bishops&#8217; Memorandum</i>.
Had those terms been agreed, what would have prevented the mine
owners from imposing their plans of a longer working day and a cut in
wages after four months? The neutral arbitrator?</p>
<p>It is sad to know that Cook was one of the main advocates of the
<i>Bishops&#8217; Memorandum</i>. The <i>Memorandum</i> met with strong
dissent from the ranks. When Cook reported to the MFGB Special
Conference of 30 July on the EC agreement to the <i>Memorandum</i>,
he met with strong opposition. E. Morrell, a member of the MFGB EC,
moved a resolution in the name of the SWMF condemning the Miners&#8217;
Federation Executive. A similar resolution to that of South Wales was
also passed by the Durham EC with special emphasis that the
&#8216;accepting of the principle of compulsory arbitration&#8217; was always
opposed by the union. <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a></p>
<p>Arthur Horner strongly attacked the <i>Memorandum</i>, and denounced Cook
and Herbert Smith for advocating it. Nye Bevan, too, denounced Arthur
Cook and George Spencer (President of Notts) for both being defeatist
under the cloak of &#8216;facing facts&#8217;. <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a></p>
<p>Cook replied:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>I make absolutely no apologies for continuing to
recommend terms of settlement like those agreed on between ourselves
and the representatives of the Churches. On these terms we could
rouse the whole nation: no government would dare to refuse them.</i>
<a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a></p>
<p class="fst">A precursor of the Broad Democratic Alliance?</p>
<p>Cook saw in the EC agreement with the Bishops&#8217; Memorandum a
clever manoeuvre: putting the mine owners and the government on the
defensive. Alas, the manoeuvre must always be subordinated to a
strategy and tactics based on the actual relation of forces. In every
strike, obviously, manoeuvre can be helpful: but the condition is
that it is not so clever as to hoodwink one&#8217;s own side instead of
the other. As morale is key in the struggle, if the manoeuvre weakens
one&#8217;s own side&#8217;s morale, it is harmful. The most effective policy
is the straightforward, honest one.</p>
<p>After a number of long and strong speeches by Herbert Smith and
Arthur Cook, they managed to carry the Conference, to win the vote,
but by less than two to one: 460 to 255 (the opposition included 130
from South Wales, 120 Durham, 5 Forest of Dean). All other districts
supported the MFGB EC.</p>
<p>The resolution then went to a district vote. This gave a majority
&#8211; of 34,614 against the MFGB EC stand. (367,650 to 333,036): South
Wales, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumberland and Forest of Dean voted
against. <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a></p>
<p>To reject the <i>Bishops&#8217; Memorandum</i>, Horner argued, was not
enough. One had to make the miners&#8217; fight more effective. For that
he suggested that the Federation withdraw all the safety men in the
pits. Horner nearly won the Conference notwithstanding the vehement
speeches against him by Cook and Herbert Smith. 360 voted for
withdrawal, 428 against. (For the withdrawal, South Wales, Yorkshire,
Lancashire and Forest of Dean.) <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a></p>
<p>But Arthur Cook and Herbert Smith did not give up, and these
continuous debates in one conference after another caused
considerable damage to the morale of the miners. It also encouraged
the government to believe it could secure a settlement on the basis
of the Samuel Report, including wage cuts.</p>
<p>At the 7 October Special Conference, the question of withdrawal of
safety men was raised again. E. Morrell and A. Horner proposed that
safety men be withdrawn, that an embargo on foreign coal be imposed,
that a special Trade Union Congress be called to impose a levy and
that outcropping be stopped. Herbert Smith led the attack on the
resolution, with strong support from Cook. By the way, it is quite
illuminating, to see the arguments used by Cook against the
suggestion of the withdrawal of safety men:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>If you adopt the resolution from South Wales, so far
as the safety men are concerned, if you were to withdraw the safety
men, we would have the blue jackets, and you would have the soldiers
protecting the men at work, and you would have a repetition of 1921,
which I hope never to see again.</i></p>
<p class="fst">How far Cook was out of step on this issue with the militant
miners is clear from the fact that this time the great majority of
Conference delegates voted for Horner&#8217;s resolution (589 to 199).
<a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a> But whatever the conference
decision, Smith and Cook did not intend to carry it out. So they
adopted delaying tactics, asking the Districts for their views.</p>
<p>While this was happening in public, Cook was busy for a number of
weeks in discussions with the Coal Committee of the Cabinet, offering
them a compromise solution to the dispute. On 3 September Jones&#8217;s
diary has the following entry:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>Mr Cook said he would very much like a private talk
with me this evening. He was desperately afraid that the claim which
the miners now had might be ruined at the very first meeting unless
the ground were prepared properly. He was having a terrific fight,
etc. etc. I agreed to meet him ...</i> <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Covering up for the TUC and Labour Party leaders</h4>
<p class="fst">Cook vacillated between exposing the treacherous role of the TUC
leaders in the General Strike and covering it up.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks after the end of the General Strike, Cook wrote
a best-selling pamphlet, <b>Nine Days</b>, which was a deadly
indictment of the TUC. Regrettably he contradicted the whole of the
pamphlet in its last sentence: &#8216;We hope still that those leaders of
the TUC who feel that a mistake has been made will rally to our cause
and help us to victory.&#8217; <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a> What a
hope!</p>
<p>One example of the bewildering speed with which Cook was ready to
change from sharp criticism of the TUC General Council to covering up
for it is the following. There was going to be a Conference of Trade
Union Executives on 25 June. However, two days before, the General
Council of the TUC and the Miners&#8217; Federation issued a joint
statement postponing the meeting &#8216;so that a united policy may be
adopted to resist to the fullest possible extent the Government&#8217;s
reaction.&#8217; &#8216;The General Council and the Miners&#8217; Federation
regard it as of the greatest importance at this juncture that all
sections and parties should avoid statements, either in speech or
writing, which create friction and misunderstanding, and which divert
attention from the purpose in view.&#8217;</p>
<p>To show his full support for this agreement Cook withdrew from
circulation his pamphlet <b>Nine Days</b>. In justification of this
step Cook wrote: <i>&#8216;Both the Industrial side of the Movement and
the Parliamentary Labour party are now absolutely with the miners.&#8217;</i>
<a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a> It seems Cook fell into the oldest
sin of opportunism, considering unprincipled combinations the highest
art in politics.</p>
<p>In fact the cessation of criticism was hardly mutual. John
Bromley, Secretary of ASLEF, and member of the General Council,
leaked in the July issue of his union journal to the public a large
part of the Report which the General Council had prepared for the
Conference. Needless to say the General Council&#8217;s Report was full
of attacks on the Miners&#8217; Federation.</p>
<p>In September the TUC Congress was held in Bournemouth. An attempt
was made by Jack Tanner of the Minority Movement, to refer back
paragraph 13 of the General Council&#8217;s Report dealing with the
mining situation and the General Strike. He spoke in the name of the
AEU. He said:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>We feel that an attempt is being made to prevent the
workers and the delegates here particularly, from knowing the whole
truth in respect to the national strike ...</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>... The General Council have been traitors, cowards
and weak fools.</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>The General Council sold the miners in calling off the
national strike when they did call it off.</i></p>
<p class="fst">W.C. Loeber (NUR) seconded the reference back. Cook intervened:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>I do hope Congress will recognise that we have over a
million miners out at the present moment, and we are more concerned
just now to get an honourable settlement for those million men than
we are in washing dirty linen in this Congress. Whatever our feelings
may be, whatever view we may take of the mistakes made, this is a
mutual arrangement arrived at while our men are on the road. The
Miners&#8217; Federation do not burke inquiry. They welcome it, but that
inquiry must come when our men are working.</i> <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a></p>
<p class="fst">Cook&#8217;s intervention put an end to the debate. His prestige was
very high, and Congress gave him a standing ovation. The reference
back was heavily defeated: 775,000 to 3,098,000. The MFGB sided with
the General Council!</p>
<p>Then Bob Smillie, the veteran miners&#8217; leader, moved from the
platform an emergency resolution recording &#8216;high appreciation of
the generous financial assistance both national and international ...
afforded the miners&#8217; and calling for continued financial support.
<a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a> &#8216;Generous financial support&#8217;!
Compare these words with a statement of W.P. Richardson, the MFGB
treasurer, on the total financial aid received from British trade
unions:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>just 3s per member during the whole twenty-six weeks
of the stoppage, or just over 1d per week per member. If we take the
total Labour vote at the last election, which is the proper figure to
take in assessing the assistance given by the movement, we find that
it works out at 2s per voter for the whole period of the stoppage or
just under 1d per voter per week ...</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>To these organisations and to all others who have
helped us, the miners are deeply grateful, but when all is said and
done, the hard fact remains that the total contribution received from
the movement is less than 1d per head per week.</i> <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a></p>
<p class="fst">Another humiliating event was the Labour Party Conference in
October in Margate. On the eve of the Conference, Cook wrote in <b>The
Miner</b>: &#8216;The miners trust and believe that the Leader of the
Labour Party will sound a clarion call which will rally the whole
movement to take active and practical measures, such as an organised
levy for the miners.&#8217; <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a></p>
<p>This referred to MacDonald, who did more than practically any
other Labour leader to betray the General Strike and the miners!</p>
<p>The Labour Party Conference repaid Cook&#8217;s soft words with a slap
in the face. In his Presidential address Robert Williams (founder
member of the Communist Party, expelled from it for scabbing on Black
Friday) said:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>&#8216;The Miners&#8217; decision to continue the dispute is
heroic. They may be likened to the sightless Samson feeling for a
grip of the pillar of the Temple, the crashing of which may engulf
this thing we call British Civilisation ... I venture to opine that
had one-tenth of the money which was spent on the conflict of May had
been spent on obtaining publicity for Labour&#8217;s plans ... a
settlement of the mining dispute ... would have given justice to the
mine workers and a lasting benefit to the Community! ... Sight is
lost of the fact that the majority of our Trade Unionists are served
by one or another form of conciliation machinery between Union and
employers ... it should not be forgotten that conciliation has
played, is playing, and must continue to play, an important part in
trade union work. If peace should be sought for internationally, I
say, let us seek industrial peace through methods of conciliation ...
In a resourceful, resilient, industrial community like our own, we
cannot subvert or overthrow, we must supersede capitalism.&#8217;</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>The miners, said Williams, called for an embargo:
&#8216;This despairing policy may be magnificent, but it is not war.&#8217;
The Communists and Minority Movement, he taunted, &#8216;still believe in
the General Strike.&#8217;</i> <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a></p>
<p class="fst">Cook&#8217;s hope that the Labour Party Conference would organise a
levy for the miners was dashed. All the big unions, with the
exception of the Miners&#8217; Federation, voted a resolution to this
effect down.</p>
<p>At the same time at the conference, Harry Pollitt moved the
reference back of the NEC Report listing fourteen local organisations
expelled from the Labour Party, for refusing to operate the 1925
Liverpool Conference decision relating to Communists. Cook remained
silent. The miners&#8217; delegation sided with the Labour Party NEC, and
the reference back was defeated by 209,000 to 3,414,000.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Miners&#8217; Federation turn on the Communist
Party and the Minority Movement</h4>
<p class="fst">When the miners&#8217; struggle collapsed and their spirits plunged,
Cook lost his vigour and heart. He was sliding without being able to
stop himself falling. Of course no individual can be immune from the
impact of a massive defeat of his class. A revolutionary party can
mitigate the impact. It is far less volatile, much more stable, than
the class. In periods of defeat, a revolutionary party does not
simply mark time; it uses the pause for training its members, for
steeling them.</p>
<p>After the end of the 1926 lockout Cook was very depressed. He was
worn out, strung out on the barbed wire of that battlefield.
Unemployment, particularly after the massive defeat of 1926,
increased exploitation without breeding a radicalisation of the
masses. On the contrary, demoralisation, atomisation, and
disintegration dominated the class. The whole trade union movement,
not least the Miners&#8217; Federation, was moving rapidly rightwards.</p>
<p>Both Cook&#8217;s isolation and the right stance of the Miners&#8217;
Federation were shown clearly in its 1927. Conference. Herbert Smith
went on a massive offensive against the CP and Minority Movement.
Turning on Arthur Horner, the leading Communist in the union, Smith
said: &#8216;You are doing as much harm as Spencer ... I want to give
some advice to Horner or anybody else that unless they are prepared
to stand four square and carry out the policy of this Federation,
then you have to get out.&#8217; <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a></p>
<p>Others sang the same tune. W.P. Richardson, Treasurer of the MFGB,
alleged that &#8216;where Spencerism exists it is where the other
extremes are given a chance ... where encouragement has been given to
weaken our ranks.&#8217; J. Robson of Durham said: &#8216;I can tell my
friends here, Mr Horner in particular, that where the Communists and
Minority Movements strongest in Durham, there we have the weakest
position.&#8217; <a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a> And this, is the same
J. Robson who a year before called on the union to withdraw the
safety men from the pits!</p>
<p>This attack on the CP took place less than a year after the end of
the lockout when the sacrifice of CP members was so impressive &#8211;
out of 5,000 arrests some 1,200 were Communists! About a quarter of
all Communists were arrested.</p>
<p>During the whole attack on the CP and Minority Movement Cook kept
completely silent.</p>
<p>A resolution moved by the left for a referendum on whether the CP
should be allowed to affiliate to the Labour Party and the right of
Communists to be delegates to Labour Party conferences was rejected
on card votes by 420 to 220. South Wales abstained. <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a></p>
<p>The move to the right was accompanied by workers pinning their
hopes on the electoral success of the Labour Party. The mass of the
workers concluded that industrial action failed, and one therefore
has to look to the ballot box as the means of improving workers&#8217;
conditions. Cook also talked about moving from struggle to
electoralism. &#8216;We should start our political agitation [for a
Labour government] immediately. One Million miners in the country
must all become political agitators for a Labour Government.&#8217; <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a></p>
<p>In his final summing up of the seven months of the lockout, again
Cook emphasised an electoral, parliamentary strategy. He wrote:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>The magnificent victory at Central Hull, following the
local elections, and the bye-elections at Hammersmith, Wallsend,
etc., show that Toryism is finally broken in Britain.</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>The price which Toryism has paid for the defeat of the
miners is its own elimination on the political field.</i> <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a></p>
<p class="fst">Arguments similar to Cook&#8217;s were used by Ramsay MacDonald in an
interview published in <b>The Miner</b> of 16 October 1926.</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>The mining crisis is now entering the political field.
The situation left by the industrial struggle will be a purely
political one ...</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>I want to use the columns of <b>The Miner</b>
to say this to the men in the industry: Turn the same splendid
fighting power, the same endurance, the same determination and
heroism which you have shown in the industrial struggle into a new
task which awaits you, namely, the winning of a Labour Government.
Surely the lesson of the last year is this. The miners cannot win
justice for themselves until they have a Labour Government in power
which can nationalise the whole industry. Therefore, for them, a
Labour Government is a vital need which they must work for with all
the might they possess.</i> <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a></p>
<p class="fst">In the days, weeks and months following the 1927 Miners&#8217;
Federation Conference a massive vendetta was launched against Cook.
Participating in this were leaders of other unions, as revenge for
Cook&#8217;s criticism of their betrayal of the General Strike. His mere
presence was a reminder of their past misdeeds. However leading
members of the Miners&#8217; Federation also participated in the campaign
of hate against Cook. They were looking for a scapegoat for the
defeat of the miners.</p>
<p>The September 1927 TUC Congress witnessed the Miners&#8217; Federation
joining the witch hunt against the Communist Party and the Minority
Movement. The General Council&#8217;s Report to the Congress included the
following resolution of the General Council of February 1927: &#8216;That
those Trades Councils which are affiliated to the Minority Movement
... shall not be accorded recognition by the General Council nor
allowed to participate in any work carried on under the auspices of
the General Council.&#8217; <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a> A number
of miners&#8217; delegates defended the Minority Movement. Cook kept mum.
The reference back of this part of the General Council&#8217;s Report was
defeated very heavily: 148,000 to 3,746,000. <a href="#n83" name="f83">[83]</a>
The MFGB voted with the right.</p>
<p>Then the question of the Anglo-Russian Committee was raised. The
General Council decided unanimously to break it up. This time Cook,
elected at the same Congress to the General Council for the first
time, did intervene. However, he did not oppose the resolution
outright. Instead he suggested that the decision should be postponed
until the new General Council discussed the issue, and it was
referred to the districts.</p>
<p>When it came to voting, the NUR voted against, and the MFGB
abstained. And this after the Soviet trade unions contributed some
three-fifths of all the money collected for the miners throughout the
lockout! The vote went the General Council&#8217;s way by 2,551,000 to
620,000. <a href="#n84" name="f84">[84]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Cook-Maxton Manifesto</h4>
<p class="fst">In November 1927 Sir Alfred Mond, Chairman of ICI and Tory MP, and
a group of big employers from a number of industries, approached the
TUC General Council with a proposal that they should meet and discuss
a drive for &#8216;rationalisation of industry&#8217; which would be carried
through more smoothly if there were harmony with the trade unions.
The General Council, of which Ben Turner was chairman, accepted the
invitation, and in July 1928 there was issued an agreed Interim
Report which supported rationalisation and cooperation between the
trade unions and the employers. The agreement fitted the mood of the
TUC leadership following the General Strike of &#8216;Never Again&#8217;.
After all, the only alternative to collaboration with the employers
was organising the defence, the resistance of workers to the
employers&#8217; offensive, while building up forces for a renewal of
struggle.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Mond-Turner&#8217; proposals became known by instalment between
April and July 1928. As the Mond-Turner was a denunciation of the
General Strike and all it stood for, Cook was impelled into
opposition. At the TUC General Council, he alone voted against the
negotiations with Mond. He started to publish a number of articles on
the subject: <i>The &#8220;Peace&#8221; War: Why I am not a Mond-ite</i>;
<i>Peace, What? My Alternative Policy</i> <a href="#n85" name="f85">[85]</a>,
and two pamphlets: <b>The Mond Moonshine: My Case Against the &#8216;Peace&#8217;
Surrender</b> (1928) and <b>Mond&#8217;s Manacles &#8211; the Destruction of
Trade Unionism</b>, with a <i>Foreword</i> by Arthur Horner (1928).</p>
<p>In June 1928 Cook, together with James Maxton, the ILP Chairman,
launched a counterblast to Mond-Turner, known as the <i>Cook-Maxton
Manifesto</i>. The <i>Manifesto</i> denounced all forms of &#8216;class
collaboration&#8217;, called for &#8216;unceasing war against capitalism&#8217;,
protested that &#8216;much of the energy which should be expended in
fighting capitalism is now expended in crushing everybody who dares
to remain true to the ideals of the movement&#8217;, and announced a
national campaign of conferences and meetings to recall the labour
movement to its task of destroying the capitalist system.</p>
<p>The Cook-Maxton campaign spurred the right to a massive vindictive
attack on Cook.</p>
<p>On 17 May 1928 the Miners&#8217; Federation EC got a complaint from
the TUC General Council regarding Cook&#8217;s pamphlet, <b>The Mond
Moonshine</b>. The EC put heavy pressure on Cook and he gave way. He
explained that because the pamphlet included personal attacks on
members of the General Council, he decided to &#8216;stop publication by
telegraphing the publisher to this effect, but it was impossible for
the publisher to comply with this, as the pamphlet was already in
circulation.&#8217; The EC accepted Cook&#8217;s explanation, and the
following resolution was agreed upon: &#8216;That this Executive
Committee reply to the letter from the Trades Union Congress that we
regret the pamphlet complained of was issued ... The Executive
Committee disassociates itself from the issue of the &#8220;Mond
pamphlet&#8221; and authorises Mr Thomas Richards to continue the
meetings of the Sub-Committee [with Mond].&#8217;</p>
<p>The Miners&#8217; Federation Conference of July 1928 in Llandudno was
the scene of a heightened campaign against Cook.</p>
<p>Herbert Smith defended the Mond-Turner Agreement and then went on
to say the following about Cook&#8217;s anti-Mond pamphlets:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>If anybody told me we were going on satisfactorily I
should say that they were not facing facts. Our membership is going
down. Why? Because of issuings of pamphlets. Making statements for
which this Federation is not responsible. Causing to get asunder with
each other. Playing the non-union men&#8217;s game. It is worse than
Spencerism.</i></p>
<p class="fst">Speaking on an EC resolution condemning the Communist Party and
the Minority Movement, Herbert Smith said: &#8216;... these dissensions
caused by the Communists and Minority Movement is responsible for 80%
of the non-Unionism.&#8217; The EC resolution was carried overwhelmingly
on a card vote &#8211; 620 to 8. Among districts voting for the
resolution were South Wales and Yorkshire, against South Derby (6.
votes) and Forest of Dean (2 votes). <a href="#n86" name="f86">[86]</a></p>
<p>The Conference also witnessed a long and sharp attack on Cook for
his contributions to the Federation&#8217;s weekly, <b>The Miner</b>.
After a long and venomous attack on him, Cook said in desperation:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>I want to make myself quite clear without making any
speech. I will give you a pledge. I have never controlled this paper.
I have never attempted to interfere with the Constitution. As a
matter of fact, so far as I am concerned, I shall not write again to
<b>The Miner</b>, and therefore, you can have <b>The
Miner</b> and do as you like with it.</i> <a href="#n87" name="f87">[87]</a></p>
<p class="fst">To rub salt in Cook&#8217;s wounds, Joseph Jones, the unsuccessful
candidate for the Secretaryship of the Federation in 1924, launched a
bitter attack on Cook, accusing him of having in July 1926 received
proposals to end the dispute from Seebohm Rowntree, Sir Walter Layton
and F.D. Stuart involving wage cuts and a longer working week. As we
have already mentioned, the MFGB set up a committee to inquire into
the allegations.</p>
<p>Cook was very wounded. Arthur Horner remembers: &#8216;Several times,
while this so-called inquiry into his conduct during the strike was
going on, Cook wanted to throw his hand in and resign. But I helped
to persuade him not to do so. He was a sick man, a very sick man.&#8217;
<a href="#n88" name="f88">[88]</a></p>
<p>The Miners&#8217; Federation Conference was followed by the TUC
Congress in Swansea. The General Council Report included the
following: &#8216;... persons associated with the National Minority
Movement will not in future be eligible to attend the Annual
Conference of Trades Councils.&#8217; Supporting the General Council in
the name of the Miners&#8217; Federation, G. Macdonald said: &#8216;We agree
that there are disruptive elements within the Trade Union Movement,
and there is no Trade Union that knows more about these disruptive
elements than the Miners, and there is no Trade Union that has paid a
higher price for those disruptive elements than the Miners.&#8217;
Herbert Smith also spoke in support of the resolution. Cook stayed
silent. The resolution was &#8216;carried by an overwhelming majority&#8217;,
i.e., there was no need to count the votes, and there was no card
vote. <a href="#n89" name="f89">[89]</a></p>
<p>In a debate on the Mond-Turner Agreement Cook did participate.
Although he made it clear that he was very much against the
Agreement, he was so polite towards other members of the General
Council that Herbert Smith could start his speech in support of the
Agreement with these wounding words: &#8216;Mr President and friends,
everybody will be delighted at Mr Cook&#8217;s quick conversion. He has
said this afternoon that the members of the General Council are doing
their best and thinking of their members.&#8217; <a href="#n90" name="f90">[90]</a></p>
<p>A few weeks later, on 13 September, the Miners&#8217; Federation EC
condemned a Manifesto signed by Cook, S.O. Davies and Harry Hicken
(all members of the EC), defending the CP and Minority Movement
against the resolution of the Federation at Llandudno. Cook and his
friends capitulated. On 12 October they issued the following
statement: &#8216;After discussion on the Executive Committee of the MFGB
and explanation given thereat we withdraw our support to the
signatures we made to the <i>Manifesto</i> published by Mr Horner on
the Llandudno Conference.&#8217;</p>
<p>So what happened to the Cook-Maxton campaign? It failed to
generate any significant groundswell of support. It fizzled out.
Trying to build an alliance between the left in the trade unions and
the left in the Labour Party was an impossible task. Cook was very
isolated in the trade union movement, and Maxton&#8217;s position in the
Labour Party was far from strong. The ILP was a very loose
organisation. It is true it had 140 MPs in 1930, but when it was
demanded from them to commit themselves to abide by ILP policies,
only 17 were prepared to continue as ILP members on those terms. The
rest resigned and supported Ramsay MacDonald. Outside Scotland the
old power of the ILP was fading. When the <i>Cook-Maxton Manifesto</i>
was published, Maxton was forced to beat back a challenge to himself
within the ILP.</p>
<p>The Cook-Maxton campaign was aimed to put socialism back on the
agenda, but it had very little to say about what was to be done. It
fell between two stools. It was on the one hand far too soft and
centrist to have a long-term survival, and on the other it was far
too small to have an immediate impact. One can make use of a small
axe that is sharp, or a massive axe that is blunt. But what can one
do with a small axe that is blunt?</p>
<p>The Cook-Maxton campaign was also ground between the massive right
leadership of the TUC and Labour Party and the small Communist Party,
now increasingly on an ultra-left binge of Third Period Stalinism.</p>
<p>Cook was forced to drink the bitter hemlock to its dregs by
kowtowing to the moguls of the Tory press.</p>
<p>The financial conditions of miners and their families was so
desperate, they were so destitute that in this extreme an appeal for
financial support, signed by Herbert Smith, President, Thomas
Richards, Vice-President, W.P. Richardson, Treasurer, and A.J. Cook,
Secretary, was sent to all daily newspapers and other periodicals.
Unlike the fighting miners, the begging miners were treated kindly by
the Tory press.</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>The Report of the Executive Committee singled out for
special mention amongst donors. The <b>Daily Mail</b>, the newspaper
which was the inveterate opponent of higher wages or improved
conditions for the miners, was now, in response to the appeal,
prepared to use its columns for this particular form of charity and
had organised the sending of 114,000 hampers of food and cast-off
clothing ...</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>The Executive report concluded &#8216;Our very best thanks
are due to the <b>Daily Mail</b></i> <i>and its readers and to
all the organisations concerned.&#8217;</i> <a href="#n91" name="f91">[91]</a></p>
<p>On 18 April 1929 Cook participated in a lunch at the Mansion House
in the City of London of the Miners&#8217; Distress Fund, a charity
sponsored by the Prince of Wales. The prince made a speech and Cook
followed it. He said:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>We owe the Prince a very real measure of thanks. His
wholehearted enthusiasm on the miners&#8217; behalf in this matter has
brought the Throne quite close to the populace ... His conduct and
his attitude have shown that all mankind have great qualities in
common, one man with every other ...</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>You, Sir, have done a marvellous thing. Never was 1 so
impressed as by your speech on Christmas Day night. I was with two
Communist friends, and when your name was announced to speak on
behalf of the Miners&#8217; Fund, they undoubtedly scoffed. But they
listened to what you had to say, and when you had finished, with
tears in their eyes, they put their hands in their pockets and gave
what money they had on them to the fund. It was a wonderful appeal
you made to the country that night.</i> <a href="#n92" name="f92">[92]</a></p>
<p class="fst">Ugh!</p>
<p>A few weeks later, during the general election campaign Cook went
to give support to the Labour candidate in Seaham Harbour.</p>
<p>This was a mining constituency and at the time there was 3,000
miners in Dowdon Colliery who had been on strike for over ten weeks.
The Labour candidate was Ramsay MacDonald. Another candidate was a
Communist, an old friend of Cook&#8217;s, Harry Pollitt. A few days after
the elections. Cook rejoined the ILP, and hence the Labour Party,
which he had left some quarter of a century earlier.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The second Labour government</h4>
<p class="fst">Labour came to office in June 1929, Cook was a completely broken
man. This explains the most agonising act &#8211; Cook&#8217;s joining Ramsay
MacDonald&#8217;s camp &#8211; and that notwithstanding this government&#8217;s
complete betrayal from its very beginning, all of the promises the
Labour leaders gave during the election campaign. <i>The Labour Party
Election Manifesto</i> included the following: &#8216;The disastrous Act
by which the Tory Government added an hour to the working day of the
miners must be at once repealed.&#8217; At the Annual Conference of the
Labour Party in October a resolution &#8216;that we press for the
immediate repeal of the Eight Hours Act&#8217; was passed unanimously.
But things did not work out like this.</p>
<p>A meeting of the leadership of the Miners&#8217; Federation with
Cabinet members made it clear that the government did not intend
keeping its promise. Instead of restoring the Seven Hours Act of 1919
the miners were offered 7½ hours &#8211; which meant no change at all
for districts such as Yorkshire. The Yorkshire delegates to the
Miners&#8217; Federation Conference on 5 November 1929 refused to accept
the government proposals on hours, but after long and very painful
discussions the majority of the delegation reluctantly accepted the
proposal. Herbert Smith, since 1921 President of the Federation,
whose base was in Yorkshire, left the chair and the conference in
disgust, never to return to the chairmanship. When the Bill came to
the House of Lords which contained many mine owners, it was amended
to make its impact on miners&#8217; conditions was even worse. An
amendment was introduced to permit a &#8216;spread-over&#8217; of 90 hours a
fortnight. This amendment meant that in some districts the miners
would still be on eight hours.</p>
<p>In the latter months of 1930 the miners&#8217; leaders were asked by
Ramsay MacDonald to agree to the spread-over. This caused great
resistance among miners. There were desperate strikes throughout the
early winter of 1930&#8211;31. The new year opened with a lockout of
South Wales miners who had refused the spread-over.</p>
<p>Ramsay MacDonald&#8217;s betrayal of his election promises met with
great resentment in the Miners&#8217; Federation. The only advocate of
MacDonald in the leadership of the Federation was A.J. Cook. It is
really embarrassing to read the minutes of the Conference of the
Federation in 1929, 1930 and 1931. At the 1929 Conference, again and
again delegates demanded from the Labour leaders to keep the promises
they gave in the elections. But Cook said: We must &#8216;face the
economics of the situation&#8217; and must not endanger the existence of
our government.</p>
<p>An old colleague of Cook&#8217;s from South Wales, W. Mainwaring,
complained of the way Cook used the economic difficulties of the
country as justification of the Labour government refusing to keep
their promise to reintroduce the seven-hour day. &#8216;We ought without
any hesitation, to declare to the Labour Government that we have
considered their position, that we have no power to come away from
our position and ask you to fulfil the pledge we have all commonly
given to the people of the country.&#8217; Cook in reply: &#8216;... we would
be false to the men we represent if we did not face the economics of
the situation.&#8217; <a href="#n93" name="f93">[93]</a></p>
<p>At the next Conference of the Miners&#8217; Federation in August 1930,
at Weston-super-Mare, the attack on Cook was even sharper. Herbert
Smith, with contempt, quoted Cook&#8217;s reaction to the debate in the
House of Lords that led to a further worsening of the original
suggestion put by the government regarding miners&#8217; working hours.
Herbert Smith quotes Cook&#8217;s words from <b>Hansard</b>: &#8216;I can now
declare that, whatever may be the personal view of myself or any of
the Executive, any application that may come to the Miners&#8217;
Executive will be considered on its merits in the light of economic
facts, and in the interests of the whole of the miners and the mining
industry.&#8217; Cook in reply spoke like a &#8216;statesman&#8217;: We have to
act responsibly. We are sitting now with Government at the top table!
<a href="#n94" name="f94">[94]</a></p>
<p>At the next Special Conference of the Miners&#8217; Federation, on 28
November 1930 in London, Cook continued the apology for the MacDonald
government. Objective international economic conditions justify its
policy and in any case the miners are dependent on the government and
cannot act for themselves in the present situation. When the
adjourned conference met again on 4 December, Cook went out of his
way to defend the government, attack Communists and praise the
Minister of Mines, Emanuel Shinwell:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>These are the friends who have initiated these schemes
and brought them to fruition, but it is only the beginning, it will
be the end if you turn them down. Whatever may be the views of Mr.
Shinwell, let me say this, he is a worker, he is not a shirker. No
man has worked harder night and day to try to bring more revenue,
some means of sustenance, some increased trade, some means of
obtaining better wages for the people we represent ...</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>The Communists have sent out leaflets. We have played
the Communist game. They want to destroy ... It is another revolution
but it means destruction to our own people ...</i> <a href="#n95" name="f95">[95]</a></p>
<p class="fst">How sad &#8211; attacking Communists, attacking revolution, while
praising MacDonald and Shinwell.</p>
<p>Alas, the miners would have to learn again the extent of
MacDonald&#8217;s treachery. After a long discussion between
representatives of the Miners&#8217; Federation and representatives of
the Cabinet, including Ramsay MacDonald, Emanuel Shinwell and Arthur
Henderson, the government made it clear that it would not support a
Minimum Wage Bill when the temporary Eight Hours Act of 1926 expired
in 1931. Instead the government put the following proposal: the
7½-hour day with spread-over would continue for another twelve
months, and that during this period wages in all the 7½-hour
districts would not be reduced. This was put to two successive
special conferences of the Miners&#8217; Federation on 25 June and 2 July
1931. The Miners&#8217; Federation EC bent to government pressure and
decided to recommend the government&#8217;s proposals to the Conference.
The EC won, but only after a very long and bitter argument.</p>
<p>To make it clear how bad the government proposals were, when a
Bill incorporating them was moved by MacDonald in the House on 6.
July, neither the Tories nor the Liberals opposed or amended it. Next
day the Bill went through Committee in less than two hours and then
was read a third time and passed. Next day the House of Lords agreed
the Coal Mines Bill without opposition.</p>
<p>What was Cook&#8217;s behaviour throughout all these developments?
When at the special conference of 19 March 1931 J. Williams of the
Forest of Dean accused the Miners&#8217; Federation EC of throwing away
the 7-hour demand, it fell to Cook to deny it. <a href="#n96" name="f96">[96]</a>
Cook went as far as to apologise for the Labour government&#8217;s
opposition to the introduction of a Minimum Wage Bill. He said: &#8216;...
unless the Government give a subsidy to pay the minimum wage, there
would be no work in South Wales or elsewhere.&#8217; And one must
&#8216;appreciate the situation. Everything which could be done has been
done.&#8217; <a href="#n97" name="f97">[97]</a> The debate continued at
the special conference of the MFGB on 2 July. Herbert Smith moved a
resolution demanding from the Labour government a restoration of the
7-hour day as from 9 July 1931. Cook replied for the Executive: &#8216;...
no man who has been through all the discussions has the right to say
that the Government has let us down, because I declare as Secretary
of this Federation, they have not let us down. They have done nothing
to let us down ... It is no use saying what they ought to do. It is
what they can do.&#8217; <a href="#n98" name="f98">[98]</a></p>
<p>The EC won the majority at the conference, but by less than two to
one &#8211; 346 to 186. This time the opposition was not restricted to
Yorkshire. After twenty months of Labour government it was now joined
by South Wales, Cumberland and Forest of Dean.</p>
<p>Another embarrassing episode in Cook&#8217;s continuing decline was
the support he gave to Ernest Bevin at the Trade Union Congress of
September 1931 held in Bristol against those who argued that the
workers should not pay for the crisis of capitalism by wage cuts or
longer hours. This argument was put very well by G. Lumley of the
Miners&#8217; Federation:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>Our immediate task is to prevent any reduction in the
standard of life either of the employed workers or the unemployed
workers ... We are told that it is because of the serious
difficulties that confront the owning class of this country that &#8216;it
is necessary to have drastic reductions in Unemployment Benefit as a
prelude to a reduction in the wages of the working class. If that is
actually the truth it can only mean one thing, that the capitalist
class can only stabilise their system at the expense of the members
of the working class, and if that is the case our duly as leaders of
the working class movement in the country is to see to it that the
capitalist class does not succeed in stabilising that system at our
expense, and to take the necessary action to make it more difficult
than ever for the capitalist class ever to be able to stabilise
industry again.</i></p>
<p class="fst">Cook attacked Lumley:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>If we could increase the wages by 1s a day we would do
it, but to do it under the present capitalist system would shut up
more pits ... There are those who blindly think that the way to
destroy capitalism is to destroy the industries where the life of our
men are invested ... What is the use of passing resolutions again and
again against reductions [of wages] when you cannot prevent them
because of the economics of our industry? Do not shut your eyes to
the economics of your industry ...</i> <a href="#n99" name="f99">[99]</a></p>
<p class="fst">And imagine, these words were said after Ramsay MacDonald had
already broken with the Labour Party. In August this happened, and he
headed now a National government which in all but name was a Tory
government.</p>
<p>On 2 November 1931 Cook died from cancer from which he had
suffered for years. He died six days after the National government&#8217;s
massive electoral victory.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>In conclusion</h4>
<p class="fst">Cook&#8217;s tragic life is a lesson on the limitations of industrial
militancy. Deep attachment to the working class, incorruptibility,
are very necessary, but not sufficient attributes, of an authentic
workers&#8217; leader. Cook&#8217;s loyalty to the miners did not prevent
rifts arising again and again between him and them. In 1921 and 1924
deep cleavages opened up between Cook and the militant miners. In the
five years between the defeat of the miners in 1926 and his death the
cleavage turned into a yawning chasm.</p>
<p>These discords between Cook and the rank-and-file miners were
caused, as we have tried to demonstrate throughout the present
article, by Cook&#8217;s not being a member of a revolutionary workers&#8217;
party. Prior to the first world war he belonged to the syndicalist
movement which was very amorphous, lacked theoretical clarity and
definite organisational structure. Its anti-leadership concept,
together with its looseness, meant that when any of its supporters
became a full-time union official he was completely free from any
democratic control by the rank and file. It is not an accident that
in the 1920s many trade union bureaucrats were formerly militant
syndicalists: Frank Hodges, founding member of URC became an extreme
right-wing leader of the Miners&#8217; Federation (and ended his life as
director of several companies &#8211; colliery, iron and steel,
chemicals, finance, etc, and a supporter of Spencerism); Robert
Williams, General Secretary of the Transport Union, founding member
of the CPGB, ended as a scab during Black Friday; A.B. Purcell, A.A.
Swales, George Hicks, all three voted on the TUC General Council to
end the General Strike. It goes without saying that it was not
confined to the syndicalist movement to create leaders who started on
the left and then moved to the extreme right. The struggle exhausts
people, brings on nervous failures, causes consciousness to suffer
from ideological confusion and decay. But where the individual is
isolated from the support of a cohesive organisation the process of
disintegration is bound to run free.</p>
<p>But could Cook not be prevented from sliding down the slippery
slope of intellectual decay by being a fellow-traveller of the CPGB?
Could it have helped him to stand up to the pressure of the trade
union machine, and safeguard his ties with the rank and file? The
answer is no.</p>
<p>First of all, fellow-travelling is not a stable relationship. We
saw how Cook broke with the CP in 1921, and then distanced himself
from it and the Minority Movement in 1924. The rift became deeper and
permanent in the last few years of Cook&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Secondly the CP itself was far from holding a consistent, critical
attitude to the trade union bureaucracy. In July 1917 J.T. Murphy
wrote, exaggerating the role of the rank and file <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>
the leadership: &#8216;... the shop stewards&#8217; duties do not involve
leadership, as a matter of fact the whole movement is repudiation of
leadership.&#8217; Now, in 1922, the same J.T. Murphy swung round
completely, arguing for an orientation on the union leaders &#8211; even
right-wing leaders. He wrote: &#8216;Are 6 million Johnny Thomases easier
to convert than one, or have you some grudge against a particular
Jimmy Thomas that you wish one of them to be ignored?&#8217; This was
after Jimmy Thomas&#8217;s betrayal of the miners on Black Friday!</p>
<p>A year later, leading CP militant Harry Pollitt wrote: &#8216;A few
leading men, if they would only see the opportunity before them, can
at this moment achieve anything by coming together on a clear
definite programme ...&#8217; He went on to quote with approval the words
of George Hicks, the &#8216;left&#8217; General Secretary of the building
workers&#8217; union AUBTW: &#8216;What is needed are about half a dozen
trusted men to draw up a programme ...&#8217; <a href="#n100" name="f100">[100]</a></p>
<p>In the years 1925&#8211;6 the CP acted as a left cover for the lefts
on the General Council. It fell into unprincipled combination with
Purcell, Swales and Hicks. It substituted diplomacy for honest
revolutionary criticism of the trade union bureaucracy. After the
catastrophic defeat of 1926 the CP leapt into ultra-leftism, &#8216;Third
Period&#8217; Stalinism, denouncing all and sundry as social fascists.
This phenomenon of swinging from tail-ending to its opposite,
adventurism, is not uncommon in history. And the hand of Moscow was
heavy during both states and during the turn from one to the other.</p>
<p>Trotsky was absolutely right in making no concessions to any of
the left bureaucrats, not even to Cook, who was the most radical of
them. He always mentioned Cook in the same breath as Hicks, Purcell
and the other lefts. For example on 5 March 1926 he wrote:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>Both the rights and the lefts, including of course
both Purcell and Cook, fear to the utmost the beginning of the
denouement. Even when they in words admit the inevitability of
struggle and revolution, they are hoping in their hearts for some
miracle that will release them from these perspectives. And in any
event they themselves will stall, evade, temporise, shift
responsibility and effectively assist Thomas over any really major
question of the British labour movement.</i> <a href="#n101" name="f101">[101]</a></p>
<p>In the final analysis the crisis of Cook was a crisis of his
politics.</p>
<p>Let us be clear what we mean by politics. Not simply the
recognition that workers in struggle come into conflict with the
state&#8211;with the police practically always, and with the army
sometimes. The active role of the police or army in a strike does not
turn the strike into a political strike. Beating up of strikers by
the police or the National Guard has been very common for a
generation in the United States, where the political level of the
working class is very low indeed. Proletarian politics, as Lenin
explained, is concentrated economics, ie, it starts where workers go
beyond sectional demands and come out as a class against the ruling
class.</p>
<p>Political struggle and economic struggle are qualitatively
different, although together they make a unity. They differ not only
qualitatively, however, but also temporally. Economic struggle may
weaken the political interests of workers for a certain time, and
vice versa, a defeat of the industrial struggle may cause workers to
turn to political struggle. This political activity may go in either
a purely parliamentary, or otherwise an extra-parliamentary
direction, depending on the concrete situation and the past
experience of the masses, included in which the strength of a
political revolutionary leadership is paramount.</p>
<p>No consistent working-class politics is possible without, or
independent of, a revolutionary party. The trade unions as such
cannot lead consistent working-class political struggle. Embracing
masses of the working class, the trade unions reflect the unevenness
that riddles the class, and the sectionalism that rends it. The
structure of the unions reflects the structure of capitalism, thus
both uniting workers and dividing them. Accordingly the MFGB did not
include railwaymen and the NUR did not include miners. The unions
contain both advanced workers and backward ones. Only in a period of
revolutionary ferment does the working class achieve homogeneity; in
&#8216;normal&#8217; times it is very heterogeneous.</p>
<p>The revolutionary party must be rooted in the class but be a
separate, cohesive disciplined unit of the class. Its aim is to lead
the working class to power. To carry this mission it must win over
the majority of the proletariat and lead its mass organisations,
above all the trade unions. To achieve such influence, the party must
lead in the day-to-day struggle to convince workers of the need to
transform society. The party has to show the real relation between
the struggle inside capitalism for reforms, and the struggle to
overthrow capitalism, for revolution. The reformists are against
revolution, and for reforms; except that quite often &#8211; when
capitalism is in deep crisis &#8211; they oppose reforms in practice too.
The syndicalists do not distinguish clearly between the struggle for
reform and revolution. They subsume both under one heading &#8211; direct
industrial action. Marxist revolutionaries are both for reforms and
revolution, with a clear view that the achievement of reform, the
deeper capitalism is in crisis, is a by-product of a revolutionary
struggle. From the slogan &#8216;An injury to one is an injury to all&#8217;
to become more than rhetoric, one must endeavour always to generalise
the struggle, to involve the maximum number of workers, and to widen
the issues raised. To go beyond the sectional and temporary struggle
for reforms to the revolutionary transformation of society is the
mission of the revolutionary party.</p>
<p>The task of the revolutionary party is to level up the
consciousness of workers. It has to raise the confidence, enthusiasm,
perseverance, and creativeness of workers. To do this the party has
to be a cohesive, disciplined unit. Otherwise any passing mood in the
class or section of the class will disorient it. The revolutionary
party is a school for tactics and strategy of the class, the
university of the class, bearer of revolutionary theory.</p>
<p>Cook gave himself completely to the cause of the working class.
