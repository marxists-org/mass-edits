<p class="fst"><strong>A History of British Trade Unions Since 1889</strong>, Volume II, <strong>1911&ndash;33</strong><br />
H.A. Clegg<br />
<em>Oxford University Press &#163;40</em></p>

<p class="fst">THIS study is a companion to a first volume covering the years 1889&ndash;1910 written by H.A. Clegg, A. Fox and A.F. Thompson.</p>

<p>Like the first volume, the present achieves a tremendous task of organising and arranging a vast amount of material, giving a comprehensive account of the subject.</p>

<p>A couple of reviewers of the first volume put it in the same class as <strong>A History of Trade Unionism</strong> written by Sidney and Beatrice Webb and published in 1894. In terms of comprehensiveness and reliability the analogy fits. However the Webbs&#8217; book was far superior. The Webbs were pioneers in giving a clear description and analysis of the trade union bureaucracy. (The Webbs admired the bureaucracy precisely because of its conservative role.)</p>

<p>Clegg&#8217;s book does not give a clear picture at all of the trade union bureaucracy; or, the other side of the coin, the rank and file striving to get out of its control. This defect is especially irritating in a volume that covers the period of the Labour Unrest, 1910&ndash;14, the great mass struggles of 1919, and the general strike of 1926.</p>

<p>A straight reading of Clegg&#8217;s book will be of little use, but as a support for studying trade unions and trade union struggle for the period it covers, it is of very good value. Clegg&#8217;s book, being of impeccable scholarship, will be of use to anyone doing research work.</p>
