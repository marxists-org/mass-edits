But this new resolution has called forth such a series ofmeasures on the part of the leading group of the Central Committeethat it is quite clear that that group is determined not to permit theformation of a government of the parties in the Soviet and to insist ona purely Bolshevik government regardless of the sacrifices to theworkers and soldiers.</p><p><i>We cannot assume responsibility for this ruinous policy of the CentralCommittee</i>, carried out against the will of a large part of the proletariatand soldiers who are most eager for an early cessation ofblood-shedding by the different wings of the democracy.</p><p>We resign from membership in the Central Committee so that wemay be free to speak openly to the workers and soldiers and to askthem to support our slogan: Long live the government of the parties inthe Soviet and an immediate understanding on these terms!</p><p>We leave the Central Committee at the moment of victory, at themoment when our party is dominant, but we do so because we cannotquietly look on while the leading group in the Central Committee wastesthe fruit of this victory and leads the proletariat to ruin.</p><p>By remaining in the ranks of the proletarian party we hope that theproletariat will surmount all obstacles and will perceive that our actionswere inspired by our feeling of duty and responsibility before theSocialist proletariat.</p><p>Yu.
