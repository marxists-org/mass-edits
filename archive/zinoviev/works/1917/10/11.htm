The interaction of all the conditions at present is suchthat if we are to speak of such an uprising a definite date must be setfor it, and that within the next few days .....</p><p>We are deeply convinced that to call at present for an armed uprisingmeans to stake on one card not only the fate of our party, butalso the fate of the Russian and international revolution.</p><p>There is no doubt that there are historical situations when an oppressedclass must recognise that it is better to go forward to defeatthan to give up without a battle. Does the Russian working class finditself at present in such a situation? <i>No, and a thousand times no!!!</i></p><p>As a result of the immense growth of the influence of our party inthe cities, and particularly in the army, there has come about at presenta situation such that it is becoming more and more impossible for thebourgeoisie to obstruct the Constituent Assembly. Through the army,through the workers, we hold a revolver at the temple of the bourgeoisie:the bourgeoisie is put in such a position that if it should undertakenow to attempt to obstruct the Constituent Assembly, it would againpush the petty-bourgeois parties to one side, and the revolver wouldgo off.</p><p>The chances of our party in the elections to the Constituent Assemblyare excellent. The talk that the influence of Bolshevism is beginningto wane, etc., we consider to have absolutely no foundation. Inthe mouths of our political opponents this assertion is simply a movein the political game, having as its purpose this very thing, to provokean uprising of the Bolsheviks under conditions favourable to our enemies.The influence of the Bolsheviks is increasing....</p><p>The Constituent Assembly, by itself, cannot of course abolish thepresent camouflaging of these interrelations. The Soviets, which havebecome rooted in life, can not be destroyed. The Constituent Assemblywill be able to find support for its revolutionary work only in theSoviets. The Constituent Assembly plus the Soviets--this is that combinedtype of state institutions toward which we are going. It is on thispolitical basis that our party is acquiring enormous chances for a realvictory.</p><p>We have never said that the Russian working class <i>alone</i>, by its ownforces, would be able to bring the present revolution to a victorious conclusion.We have not forgotten, must not forget even now, that betweenus and the bourgeoisie there stands a huge third camp: the petty bourgeoisie.This camp joined us during the days of the Kornilov affair andgave us victory. It will join us many times more. We must not permitourselves to be hypnotised by what is the case at the present moment.Undoubtedly, at present this camp is much nearer to the bourgeoisiethan to us. But the present situation is not eternal, nor even durable.And only by a careless step, by some hasty action which will make thewhole fate of the revolution dependent upon an immediate uprising, willthe proletarian party push the petty bourgeoisie into the arms ofMilyukov .....</p><p>We are told: (1) that the majority of the people of Russia is alreadywith us, and (2) that the majority of the international proletariatis with us. Alas!--neither the one nor the other is true, and this is thecrux of the entire situation .....</p><p>In what perspective then does the immediate future present itselfto us? Here is our answer.</p><p>It stands to reason that our path does not depend upon ourselvesalone. The enemy <i>may compel</i> us to accept decisive battle before theelections to the Constituent Assembly. Attempts at a new Kornilovaffair will of course not leave us even the elections. We will then, ofcourse, be unanimous in the only possible decision. But at that time asubstantial part of the petty-bourgeois camp too will surely support usagain. The flight of the government to Moscow will push the massesof the petty bourgeoisie over to us .....</p><p>But in so far as the choice depends upon us, we can and we mustlimit ourselves to a <i>defensive position</i>. The Provisional Government isoften powerless to carry into execution its counter-revolutionary intentions.. . . . The strength of the soldiers and workers is sufficient toprevent the realisation of such steps by Kerensky and Company. Thepeasant movement has only just begun. The mass suppression of thepeasant movement by the Cadets cannot succeed with the sentiment ofthe army as it now is. The Provisional Government is powerless to fixup the elections to the Constituent Assembly. Sympathy with our partywill grow. The bloc of the Cadets, the Mensheviks, and the S.-R.'s willfall apart. In the Constituent Assembly we shall be such a strong oppositionparty that in a country of universal suffrage our opponents willbe compelled to make concessions to us at every step, or we will form,together with the Left S.-R.'s, non-party peasants, etc., a ruling blocwhich will fundamentally have to carry out our programme. This is ouropinion.</p><p>Before history, before the international proletariat, before the RussianRevolution and the Russian working class, we have no right tostake the whole future on the card of an armed uprising. It would bea mistake to think that such action now would, if it were unsuccessful,lead only to such consequences as did July 16-18. Now it is a questionof something more. It is a question of decisive battle, and defeat in <i>that</i>battle would spell defeat to the revolution.</p><p>This is the general situation. But everyone who does not wantmerely to talk about uprising must carefully weigh its chances. Andhere we consider it our duty to say that at the present moment it wouldbe most harmful to underestimate the forces of our opponent and overestimateour own forces. The forces of the opponent are greater thanthey appear. Petrograd is decisive, and in Petrograd the enemies of theproletarian party have accumulated substantial forces: 5,000 militarycadets, <i>excellently</i> armed, <i>organised, anxious</i>, .... and able to fight,also the staff, shock troops, Cossacks, a substantial part of the garrison,and very considerable artillery, which has taken up a position in fan-likeformation around Petrograd. Then our adversaries will undoubtedlyattempt, with the aid of the C.E.C., to bring troops from the front. Theproletarian party at the present time would have to fight under an entirelydifferent interrelationship of forces than in the days of the Kornilovaffair. At that time we fought together with the S.-R.'s, the Mensheviks,and to some extent even with the adherents of Kerensky. Now,however, the proletarian party would have to fight against the BlackHundreds, plus the Cadets, plus Kerensky and the Provisional Government,plus the C.E.C. (S.-R.'s and Mensheviks).</p><p>The forces of the proletarian party are, of course, very substantial,but the decisive question is, is the sentiment among the workers andsoldiers of the capital really such that they see salvation only in streetfighting, that they are impatient to go into the streets? No. There is nosuch sentiment. Even those in favour of the uprising state that the sentimentof the masses of workers and soldiers is not at all even like theirsentiments upon the eve of July 16. If among the great masses of thepoor of the capital there were a militant sentiment burning to go intothe streets, it might have served as a guarantee that an uprising initiatedby them would draw in the biggest organisations (railroad unions,unions of postoffice and telegraph workers, etc.), where the influence ofour party is weak. But since there is no such sentiment even in thefactories and barracks, it would be self-deception to build any planson it.</p><p>We are told: but the railroad workers and the postoffice and telegraphemployees are starving, are crushed by poverty, are exasperatedwith the Provisional Government. All this is so, of course. But all thisis still no guarantee that they will support an uprising against the government,in spite of the S.-R.'s and Mensheviks. The railroad workersand employees were crushed by poverty also in 1906, even as they arenow in Germany and France ..... If all these people who are crushedby poverty were always ready to support the armed uprising of theSocialists, we would have won Socialism long ago.</p><p>This emphasises our immediate task. The Congress of Soviets hasbeen called for October 20/November 2. It must be convened, no matter what thecost. It must organisationally consolidate the growing influence of theproletarian party. It must become the centre of the consolidation aroundthe Soviets of all proletarian and semi-proletarian organisations, suchas those same railroad unions, unions of postoffice and telegraph employees,bank employees, etc. As yet there is no firm organisationalconnection between these organisations and the Soviets. This cannotbe considered as other than a symptom of the organisational weaknessof the proletarian party. But such a connection is in any case a preliminarycondition for the actual carrying out of the slogan, "All powerto the Soviets." For any given moment this slogan naturally signifiesthe most decisive resistance to the slightest encroachment on the rightsof the Soviets and organisations created by them, on the part of thegovernment.</p><p>Under these conditions it would be a serious historical untruth toformulate the question of the transfer of power into the hands of theproletarian party in the terms: either now or never. . . . . The partyof the proletariat will grow. Its programme will become known tobroader and broader masses. It will have the opportunity to continueon an even larger scale the merciless exposure of the policy of theMensheviks and S.-R.'s who stand in the way of actual transfer of thepower into the hands of the majority of the people. And there is onlyone way in which the proletarian party can interrupt its successes, andthat is if under present conditions it take upon itself to initiate anuprising and thus expose the proletariat to the blows of the entireconsolidated counter-revolution, supported by the petty-bourgeois democracy.Against this perilous policy we raise our voice in warning.</p><p>G.
