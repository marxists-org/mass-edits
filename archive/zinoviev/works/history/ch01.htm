History of the Bolshevik Party</p>
<a name="00"></a>
<H1>Lecture One</H1>
    <p>WHAT is a party? This question would appear to be very
      simple. Amongst those present there will be without doubt many
      party members, and it is even possible that this question will
      seem to them an idle one. But this is not so at all.</p>

    <p>When we are dealing with scientific definitions in those fields
    where masses of people are involved in a living way &mdash; this is
    entirely applicable to social organisations &mdash; then you will
    nearly always see that the representatives of different classes
    and world outlooks define differently the essence of this or that
    social organisation. Let us take as the nearest example to the
    present case, that of the trade union in which millions of people
    participate. Everyone knows what such an organisation consists
    of. And yet, at the same time, the representatives of different
    classes give it different definitions. While Karl Marx used four
    words to express the essence of a trade union as &#147;a school of
    socialism&#148; the representatives of the bourgeois world of
    science define it quite differently. The Webbs, the well-known
    British writers of reformist and Menshevik persuasion, maintain
    that a trade union is nothing other than an organisation of mutual
    aid and in fact, benevolence. And if in addition you wish to know
    how, let&#146;s say, some German professor supporting the Catholic
    Centre party defines a trade union you will find that in his
    opinion it is virtually a religious institution or a charitable
    foundation.</p>

    <p>And this is understandable, for in questions where the
    interests of hundreds of thousands of people are directly involved
    you will search in vain for any impartiality in the definition of
    the most ordinary things. Therefore our wish to define a party,
    from the very beginning, is far from idle.</p>

<a name="01"></a>
<H2>Marxist and bourgeois definitions of the word &#147;party&#148;</H2>
    <p>The word &#147;party&#148; comes from the Latin <I>pars,
      </I>that is, a part. Today we Marxists say that a party is a
      part of a particular class. The representatives of the bourgeois
      world of course think otherwise. So for example the
      distinguished German conservative journalist Stahl who
      classified parties by the appearance of their degree of
      revolutionary or constitutional basis in relation to the old
      regime came to the conclusion that the struggle of parties is
      the struggle between the divine and the human order, between the
      precepts of divine providence and institutions created as a
      result of the transient needs and fancies of man, or to put it
      more briefly, between good and evil. And the no less
      distinguished Zurich political figure, Rohmer, attempts to place
      psychology at the basis of the definition of parties. He says
      approximately the following: </p>

    <p class="quoteb">&#147;Human society is born, develops and
    dies. Consequently it can be young or old. In accordance with its
    age this or that political outlook holds sway. In man&#146;s
    childhood the passive forces of the spirit prevail; sensibility
    and living fantasy develop during this stage but there is no
    creative force or rational criticism. Radicalism above all
    corresponds to this state. (Hence radical parties). In youth and
    maturity the creative forces of the spirit and healthy criticism
    move to the fore, in youth a striving for creativity plays the
    major role while in maturity it becomes one to conserve what has
    been acquired. Liberalism and conservatism correspond to these
    states. (According to this theory the majority of those present in
    this hall filled with communists ought to be either liberals or
    conservatives.) Finally in old age the passive forces of the
    spirit take the upper hand; a fear of everything new and an
    addiction to me old; this corresponds to absolutism. Thus in any
    society young, mature and senile elements are simultaneously in
    existence and we can see corresponding to this coexistence
    radical, liberal, conservative and absolutist parties out of which
    those which most closely match the temperament and spirit of the
    people predominate. The existence of all these parties is
    inevitable; political life must proceed through equally active
    forces which have developed in society and the wise politician
    must even when fighting against them never aim to destroy any one
    of them completely because such an aim is unattainable, and to
    accomplish it would only drive tho infection inside the
    organism. The temperament of a given individual will primarily
    determine his adherence to one or another party. Thus Alcibiades
    was a boy all his life, Pericles remained a youth until his grave,
    Scipio was a man and Augustus was born an old man. And peoples
    also are in just the same way distinguished by different
    characters: the Germans are conservative by temperament but
    liberal by their cast of mind; the Russians are radical but
    inclined towards absolutism.&#148; (All this was of course written
    before 1917).</p>

<a name="02"></a>
<H2>Why cannot bourgeois science provide a correct definition of the word &#147;party"?</H2>
    <p>So you can see that in bourgeois science the definitions of the
      concept of &#147;party&#148; are extremely diverse. And it is a
      rare thing when one of its representatives decides to take the
      bull by the horns and says straight out that a party is the
      militant organisation of this or that class. This simple truth
      which is absolutely plain to you and me, bourgeois scientists
      will not and cannot admit for the same reason that they avoid
      calling parliamentarianism or the church by their proper
      names. The bourgeois system is by its very nature compelled to
      depict a whole number of institutions designed for the class
      oppression of the proletariat as organs of class harmony and
      reconciliation; it has to present them to public opinion and
      even to itself in just this form and not as organs of class
      struggle.</p>

    <p>To clarify even more I will give you a definition of the word
    &#147;party&#148; belonging to one of the comparatively
    inoffensive Russian journalists, the half-Cadet, half-Narodnik and
    fairly talented journalist, Vodovozov. In a particular essay
    devoted to the definition of the word &#147;party&#148; he writes
    &#147;What is a party? This word refers to more or less sizeable
    groups of people having common political ideals</p>

    <p>and striving for one and the same political reforms and
    organised for the defence of these ideals or for the struggle to
    realise them&#148;. This definition appears to be innocuous and
    close to the truth. But in fact the author consciously and
    carefully avoids the words &#147;class&#148; and &#147;class
    struggle&#148;. In his opinion a party is purely and simply an
    organisation of like-minded people sympathising with a specific
    &#147;ideal&#148;. To put it another way the very essence is
    tacking from this definition, it lacks flesh and blood, suffers
    from anaemia and has no real content.</p>

<a name="03"></a>
<H2>Milyukov&#146;s Definition</H2>
    <p>Let us take an even more recent example: Milyukov&#146;s
      definition. You will see that this too is dictated by a
      particular class interest. We all know that the Cadet Party
      which Milyukov led called itself &#147;non-class&#148;. We
      fought it on this ground and demonstrated that non-class parties
      do not exist and that the Cadet Party was a class one
      representing a definite class of landowners and the
      bourgeoisie. For if today you cast a glance in retrospect, that
      is, look back, then you will understand why Milyukov in the
      event, emerged simultaneously as a bourgeois scholar and as a
      militant politician. For him as a militant politician it was
      necessary that the class, landowner character of his party was
      not clear to the people: the Cadets could not openly tell the
      masses that they were defending the interests of the landowners
      and the upper bourgeoisie, that is, of the small propertied
      minority of the population. As a militant politician he sensed
      and understood that at every mass meeting it was necessary to
      keep his party under a veil, to bring it onto the stage as a
      beautiful unknown and to conceal its features carefully. And in
      this task Milyukov the militant politician was faithfully served
      by that pillar of learning, Professor Milyukov, who proved with
      the aid of his bourgeois erudition that it is not at all
      obligatory for a party to be a class one and that his party was
      a group of like-minded people having definite &#147;ideals&#148;
      irrespective of what layer of the population they might be
      connected with. This example clearly shows you how easy it is to
      throw a bridge across from the academic definition of Vodovozov
      to the wholly concrete active bourgeois policy of
      Milyukov. Vodovozov&#146;s latter formula was very useful as it
      could easily shield the Cadet party and thus smuggle in a class
      party under a non-party yoke.</p>

<a name="04"></a>
<H2>The S.R. party&#146;s formula</H2>
    <p>Let us now take some closer neighbours of ours, the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries. You know that they did not call their
      party non-class but inter-class. This definition flowed from
      their programme. And in fact the classic formula of the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries stated that they represent m the first
      place the proletariat, in the second, the peasantry, and in the
      third, the intelligentsia: that is, three major social layers at
      one and the same time. For this reason the very first
      theoretical battles waged between the Marxists and the S.R.s
      revolved around the assertion that inter-class parties do not
      exist. Every party is connected with a definite class and must
      therefore defend definite interests. We have linked our fate
      with the proletariat, we said. This still does not mean that we
      will have an inimical relationship with the peasantry,
      particularly in this predominantly peasant country. The task of
      the proletariat in such a country consists in creating a certain
      co-operation and collaboration with a second and numerically
      vast class. We have come from the proletariat. We are <I>its
      </I>party. While being a party of the proletariat, we will,
      however, lead the peasantry in struggle too, for we have many
      interests in common.</p>

    <p>After the events of the recent years the practice of the
    S.R. party has become sufficiently clear and only now is it
    transparently clear why they latched on to that definition of the
    concept of the party which they gave in the 1900s, for example,
    when their party was still only being born. It seemed to many
    young comrades at that time that Plekhanov  &mdash;  then the
    generally acknowledged leader of our party  &mdash;  paid too much
    attention to this controversy; it seemed that he had embarked upon
    a struggle without any real point. Many people then supposed that
    the polemic between Plekhanov and Chernov was purely academic, and
    others reproached them for starting a row over the concept of
    &#147;party and class&#148; instead of waging a joint struggle
    against autocracy. But now you can see that this dispute was not
    academic but political and highly important.</p>

    <p>That is why it is necessary above all to specify what you and I
    will understand by the word &#147;party&#148; and define it
    clearly and exactly. We understand by this word a political
    organisation forming a part of any class. To put it another way
    parties are proletarian and bourgeois. For us, a party is not
    simply a group of like-minded people or a collection of people
    sharing a common ideology which, irrespective of their connection
    with this or that class, they can preach wherever they wish. For
    us a party is, I repeat, a part of a particular class, which has
    arisen from its depths and has linked its fate with it. And the
    circumstance of the class from which a given party arises places
    upon it an ineffaceable imprint, determines the whole of its
    future life and its role in relation to a given state.</p>

<a name="05"></a>
<H2>Class and Party</H2>
    <p>Today we use the words &#147;working class&#148; and
      &#147;class&#148; which are clear, comprehensible and beyond the
      realm of debate for any of us. For you and I the concept of
      &#147;class&#148; has entered our flesh and blood and our
      everyday life: we have seen a class acting in two revolutions
      and have studied it well; for us it is an elementary basic
      concept. But previously it was not so. From my exposition you
      will see that the whole struggle between the Marxists and the
      Narodniks took shape, at least in its first period, over the
      formula of &#147;class&#148; or simply &#147;people&#148; as it
      was then expressed. There was a time when the entire struggle in
      Russian socialism turned around the questions: what is a class
      and should the revolutionary have in mind a particular class or
      is he obliged to fight for the whole &#147;people"?</p>

    <p>As you know the theory of the class struggle was discovered by
    none other than Marx. This does not mean that he discovered the
    class struggle. This struggle is not a theory but a living
    fact. But formulating, generalising and providing us with a
    conception of the whole history of mankind as a struggle of
    different classes was Marx&#146;s work. And the whole struggle of
    the founders of our Marxist party against the first generation of
    revolutionaries, the Narodniks, could essentially be to explaining
    the class struggle by the Russian experience and to providing a
    conception of what the working class in Russia was. That is why
    this simple concept which today forms the property of each one of
    us, the concept that our party is a part of the working class, has
    been forged over decades of theoretical and practical
    struggle. And if we wish to understand the history of our party
    then we must before all else be quite clear on this first
    point.</p>

    <p>In finishing the examination of this question I must say the
    following as well. I may be reminded that frequently one class has
    several parties. This is of course true. The bourgeoisie as a
    whole for example can count several parties: republicans,
    democrats, radical-socialists, simple radicals, independent
    liberals, conservatives etc. &#147;Doesn&#146;t this fact
    contradict the definition I have given?&#148; I will be asked. I
    don&#146;t think so. It is necessary to bear in mind that
    bourgeois parties often in practice form not separate
    self-contained parties but merely factions of a single bourgeois
    party. These factions fight amongst themselves like game-cocks at
    this or that moment (especially when it is a question of
    elections) and rattle pasteboard swords at each other
    generally. Often it is even advantageous to them to put things
    over to the people as if they had serious disagreements. But in
    actual fact on the basic questions embracing millions of people
    they share a complete unanimity. They quarrel only over secondary
    questions while on the fundamental questions over which people
    fight on the barricades, plan revolutions and suffer from civil
    war and famine on all these questions, and above all on the
    question of private property, all bourgeois parties are
    unanimous. And in the final count we have every right to say that
    in relation to the main questions there exists only one big
    bourgeois party, the party of the slave-owners and supporters of
    private property.</p>

    <p>In history there are plenty of examples of this. At one time in
    America the northern and the southern states came to blows over
    disagreements on the question of slavery. But this did not prevent
    the young bourgeois country which was only then taking shape, from
    emerging a short time later before the whole world in the role of
    a strong bourgeois state based firmly upon the principle of
    private property and in no way denying modern capitalist
    slavery. And you can in general point to as many such collisions
    between different bourgeois parties as you like but they only
    confirm our position that a party forms a part of a definite
    class.</p>

    <p>Now I shall direct your attention to yet another
    circumstance. It should not be thought that every class
    immediately puts forward as it were a ready-made party
    corresponding to its interests as a whole. It would be a mistake
    to think that things are just as simple as follows: class no. 1
    with party no. 1; class no. 2 with party no. 2. In social life and
    conflict things develop in a much more complex way. Individual
    people can make mistakes. It sometimes seems to them that they
    belong heart and soul to one class but when put to the test and a
    decisive moment arrives it can turn out that in fact they are in
    their whole being of another class. Their road follows a zigzag
    path. In certain periods of their development they put forward
    definite policies. In the course of time and under the influence
    of the turmoils of the class struggle and whirlwind of great
    events; when hidden layers of the particular class heave up and
    sharply pose new questions, deep down inside these people
    regroupings, shifts and crystallisations take place. And it is
    only a long while afterwards in the critical years that the basic
    questions powerfully emerge and divisions are finally created
    which really correspond to the given class. That is why if you
    approach this question too schematically and too simplistically
    you will meet many contradictions in your way. This basic question
    of our life has to be approached scientifically as befits Marxists
    &mdash;  that is by rejecting from the outset an excessively
    mechanical approach to social phenomena. One has to understand
    that a party is not born overnight, that it takes shape over
    years, that inside its ranks definite social regroupings occur and
    that individual groups and people will sometimes fall accidentally
    into this or that party, will then leave it and others will take
    their place. And only in the process of struggle when we are
    confronted with a more or less completed cycle of developments can
    it be said that a particular party fully corresponds to a given
    class.</p>

    <p>All the above also gives us an answer to the question, what is
    the relation between the Communist, Bolshevik Party and the
    working class? It can be said: if a party is a part of a class, if
    our party is a part of the working class, its representative body,
    vanguard and leader then how is it that there are still other
    workers&#146; parties? How is it that there is the party of the
    Mensheviks calling itself a workers&#146; party and the party of
    the Socialist-Revolutionaries which also declares that it defends
    the working class? And speaking on an international scale how is
    it that there exist Social-Democracy and the Second International,
    both connected with the working class? Doesn&#146;t all this
    contradict our definition?</p>

    <p>This question is not academic either because it brings us right
    to the crux of the matter. What I said about bourgeois parties
    relates to a considerable degree to workers&#146; parties
    too. Neither the working class nor a workers&#146; party is born
    all at once. The working class takes shape gradually over decades:
    the rural population overflows into the cities, in part returning
    home and in part settling there; it simmers over and over again in
    the cauldrons of the industrial cities creating the working class
    with its characteristic psychology. In a similar way a party of
    the working class also takes shape over years and decades. Certain
    groups considered subjectively that they were defending the
    workers, as for example the Mensheviks did in the first
    revolution. And only gradually when history raises all those
    questions which I have attempted to outline to you, those basic
    questions which separate people into different sides, make enemies
    of friends and place them on opposing sides of the barricades and
    produce civil war  &mdash; only then does stratification,
    crystallisation, splitting and re-unification begin and only then
    does a definite party finally take shape. And this process which
    is closely tied up with people&#146;s lives will terminate in a
    complete form only with the era of the complete victory of
    socialism, that is when classes and parties disappear. It is not a
    chemical process which can be observed through to the end in a
    flask. In social phenomena one has to learn how to generalise and
    to probe more deeply into events and facts which embrace in their
    radius of action millions and tens of millions of people.</p>

    <p>At the present moment the Second International still has
    considerable links with working class groups while being, as it is
    clear to all of us, in essence nothing but a faction of the
    bourgeoisie, its left wing. Many honest workers are members of the
    Second International. We have several workers&#146; parties while
    there exists only one working class. At the same time it is
    necessary to note that although there are several workers&#146;
    parties there is only one proletarian party. A party can be a
    workers&#146; one m its composition and yet not be proletarian in
    its orientation, programme and policy. This is clear from the
    exam-pies of the capitalist countries of Europe and America where
    there are several workers&#146; parties but only a single
    proletarian one, the Communist Party. There you have not only
    Social-Democratic parties but Catholic, i.e. church, trade unions
    and all sorts of other unions. All of them are parts of the
    working class but in their policies they are merely a faction of
    the bourgeoisie.</p>

<a name="06"></a>
<H2>Anniversary dates</H2>
    <p>All we have said above is necessary for a conscious attitude
      towards the history of our party. Its creation, its
      &#147;process of formation&#148;; or to use philosophical terms,
      all its prehistory and its first chapters which occupied many
      many years is nothing but a gradual crystallisation of a
      workers&#146; party in the depths of the working class. And
      therefore when we speak of the twenty-fifth anniversary of our
      party this must be taken with certain qualifications. You will
      see this from a number of examples.</p>

    <p>The &#147;North Russian Workers&#146; League&#148; founded with
    the assistance of Plekhanov and set up under the leadership of
    Khalturin, a joiner and Obnorsky a fitter must be regarded as the
    first cell of a workers&#146; party. It was born at the end of
    1877 (you could even say 1878) in St. Petersburg and was first to
    advocate the idea of the political struggle of the working
    class. This organisation was of course not yet Marxist. Exactly 45
    years have passed since 1878 and it would not of course be
    stretching matters too far to count the chronology of our party
    from the formation of the &#147;North Russian Workers&#146;
    League&#148;.</p>

    <p>The &#147;Emancipation of Labour Group&#148; was founded in
    1883. It was formed at a time when a generation of
    revolutionaries, headed by Plekhanov and Axelrod, which had
    survived the Narodnik affliction, broke from populism and
    recognised the necessity of building a party on the basis of the
    working class. This group first put forward, in 1885, a draft
    programme of the Social. Democratic Party and forming therefore
    the first Marxist organisation in the history of our revolutionary
    movement has therefore every right to be the chronological point
    of departure of our party. In this instance we would say that we
    are celebrating its 40th anniversary.</p>

    <p>We could consider as a third date our First Party Congress
    which was held at Minsk on 14th March 1898 and if we take this as
    our starting point then we can celebrate our 25th anniversary. But
    it must be noted that this date is accidental. This congress
    passed leaving relatively no traces. The organisations formed in
    Minsk were broken up almost 24 hours after the congress, its
    participants were nearly all arrested while the Central Committee
    of our party fell almost wholly into the clutches of the gendarmes
    and could not carry out even a hundredth of the party&#146;s
    programme of work.</p>

    <p>Later followed our Second Congress which was held in 1903 and
    began in Brussels and ended in London. In essence it was this
    congress which was the first and we could say with just as much
    right in this case that we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of
    our party. Then in 1905 in London the third and genuine congress
    of our party was held, a congress of a party of Bolsheviks as
    there were no Mensheviks there. (This was at the point of the
    split with them). This congress can also be considered as the
    first one for it drew up the basis for the tactics of the
    Bolsheviks on the eve of the first, 1905, revolution. So, in this
    case, we could celebrate the 18th anniversary of our party&#146;s
    foundation. And finally we could say that we should count the
    history of our party from the moment of the complete rupture from
    the Mensheviks which occurred in 1912 when we began to resurrect
    our party after the lengthy period of the counter-revolution upon
    the basis of the upsurge precipitated by the Lena strike and the
    events following it.</p>

    <p>This was at the AU-Russian conference at Prague where there
    were no Mensheviks present either and at which we said: the old
    Central Committee no longer exists, we are building the party
    afresh. Strictly speaking it was then that the foundations of our
    party were laid after the defeat of 1905 and after the phase of
    counter-revolution which it had passed through.</p>

    <p>Following this road further we could say that a complete break
    from the Mensheviks came not in 1912 but in 1917. And this is
    correct because after the February revolution and after the
    overthrow of Tsarism, in this very hall, an attempt was made to
    convene a united congress of social-democracy where everyone was
    invited and to which Lenin addressed his celebrated theses which
    have entered the history of international socialism, the theses on
    Soviet power. Up till that minute everyone thought that after the
    fall of Tsarism social-democracy would manage to unite itself, and
    that the Bolsheviks would merge with the Mensheviks.</p>

    <p>And as a final point it might be said that not until our
    Seventh Congress in 1918 after the Brest peace, when we decided to
    rename the party the Russian Communist Party, was it finally
    formed.</p>

<a name="07"></a>
<H2>The process of formation of a party</H2>
    <p>I have deliberately included a whole series of dates as I wish
      to show that the formal and secondary question of whether it
      should be 20 or 25 years is not important, but rather the fact
      that a party takes shape in living reality. This does not at all
      occur so that on one fine day, as Vodovozov expressed it, the
      supporters of definite &#147;ideals&#148; get together and say
      to each other: &#147;Well then, come on, let&#146;s form a
      party!&#148; No, a party is not formed quite so simply! It is a
      living organism connected by millions of threads with the class
      from which it emerges. A party takes shape over years and even
      decades. If you calculate for example from the moment when
      Khalturin formed the &#147;North Russian Workers&#146;
      League&#148; then the result is 45 years; if you start your
      calculation from the moment when our party was called
      &#147;Communist&#148; then you have 5 years; if you count from
      the first congress of our party then you have 25 years and
      finally if you calculate from the moment of the birth of the
      &#147;Emancipation of Labour Group&#148; then you have 40
      years. Hence it is clear that the living dialectical formation
      of a party is a very complex, lengthy and difficult process. It
      is born amid sharp pangs and it is subject to perpetual
      crystallisations, regroupings, splits and trials in the heat of
      the struggle before it finally takes shape as a party of the
      proletariat, as the party of a given class and then only with
      the reservation which I have already made, namely that the
      process is still not finally completed since the departure of
      some groups and the adherence of others continues for a long
      time to follow. All this we can observe in the fate of our party
      as well. If you make a close examination of our party&#146;s
      social composition then you will see that even in its current
      shape when it has managed over 45 years to have finally formed
      itself there still occur definite shifts and a relentless
      renewal of its elements; you will see how after the revolution
      the number of peasants in it increased with enormous speed and
      how afterwards their specific gravity became less; you will see
      how once again the number of the urban proletariat grew and how
      the intelligentsia at first entered it in whole groups and then
      began to leave in dense crowds. That is why only by pondering
      the peculiarities of this movement, only by examining the party
      as a dialectical concept, only by juxtaposing it with the living
      struggle of the masses which stretches over years and decades,
      can you understand the party as you should.</p>

<H2>Populism (&#147;Narodnikism&#148;)</H2>
    <p>I have already said that the first phase of the history of the
      Russian revolutionary movement was occupied by the struggle
      between Marxism and populism: a movement which in one of its
      wings was undoubtedly revolutionary and which reached its
      particular high point in the 1870s.</p>

    <p>Populism has inscribed many glorious pages in the history of
    our struggle and has provided a number of unforgettable examples
    of personal courage. The heroism of individual Narodniks who left
    their families, their class and their class privileges and went
    off, as was then said &#147;to the people&#148;, was amazing and
    we have an admiration for it. But at the same time populism as a
    whole was not a proletarian movement. If it was said at that time:
    &#147;we must go to the people&#148; then this expression was not
    used Accidentally. The concept of &#147;class&#148; did not exist
    for the Russia of those days and the revolutionaries of that era
    only knew the concept &#147;people&#148;. All of us of course
    stand for the people and it is self-evident that there is nothing
    but good in this concept. But if we take a look at it from the
    point of view of scientific definitions then we will see that in
    those days a confused ides was purposely incorporated in the
    word. In those days the &#147;people&#148; meant in most cases the
    peasantry, for the working class as such did not then exist: it
    was only being born. By dint of this the Narodnik movement, though
    revolutionary, was still petty-bourgeois. From this, however, it
    does not follow that we renounce this heritage and reject the
    models of heroism and remarkable courage displayed by the
    revolutionaries of the Narodnik period.</p>

<a name="09"></a>
<H2>Attitude of Communists towards the French Revolution</H2>
    <p>Let us recall how we communists approach, let us say, the great
      bourgeois revolutionaries of the French Revolution of 1789, when
      the working class also was still only in embryo. We approach
      them with the greatest respect and especially those of them who
      proved their unusual dedication to their people. We study the
      history of the French Revolution and we urge our youth to learn
      from the example of the materialists of that time. And as a
      matter of fact anyone who is interested in philosophy can learn
      far more from any prominent materialist of the era of the
      bourgeois revolution than from certain newly-fledged revisionist
      &#147;Marxists&#148;. For this very reason our party regards it
      as absolutely necessary to re-issue especially the classics of
      materialism as every one of us will extract far more benefit
      from them than from the hastily worked out &#147;theories&#148;
      served up to us which, though at times outwardly
      well-intentioned, have nothing in common with Marxism. Let me
      repeat: we are bringing our youth up in the spirit of the
      deepest respect for the outstanding representatives of the
      French bourgeois revolution. We understand its class nature. We
      know that it sent the monarch to the guillotine but we remember
      also that it promulgated a law against workers&#146;
      associations. And at the same time the pleiad of the great
      bourgeois revolutionaries was the strike force of humanity; it
      was the first to breach the front of feudalism and thereby to
      give a clear passage to the floodwaters of the then swelling
      proletarian revolution. This did not stop the epigones of the
      French revolutionaries from being despicable, petty little men
      and the agents of capital in the fullest sense of the word. And
      we know very well the difference between Marat and even
      Robespierre and their epigones, the present-day Poincaré,
      Briand and Viviani. It is well-known to us that the then
      representatives of the bourgeoisie, acting under the conditions
      of feudal oppression, drove a breach through feudalism while
      today&#146;s representatives of the bourgeoisie who, readily
      attiring themselves, like Poincaré and his associates, in the
      robes of the heirs of the French Revolution form in actual fact
      only the contemptible tools of bourgeois reaction. We know the
      difference between them. And such is our attitude towards the
      Narodniks too.</p>

<a name="10"></a>
<H2>Attitude of Communists towards Populism</H2>
    <p>We know the worth of Zhelyabov, Sofia Perovskaya and all those
      who, in the days of the Tsarism which hung upon the feet of
      Russia like a ball and chain, in the days when an
      unprecedentedly barbaric oppression raged through the country,
      knew how to level their weapons up against autocracy, how to
      lead the first groups of revolutionaries into battle and how to
      walk firmly towards the gallows. Granted that this &#147;going
      out to the people&#148; was not a proletarian movement, granted
      that this was a revolutionary movement painted only in a misty
      socialist hue; granted all this, yet it was a great movement
      just as the start of the French Revolution was. These Narodniks
      made a breach in the Tsarist wall and in the autocratic
      stronghold. They were heroes, they broke from prejudices, they
      burst the chains shackling them to the privileged class, they
      renounced everything and went into the struggle for political
      freedom. While they sometimes embellished their struggle with
      socialist phrases without having a definite socialist programme,
      they could not have one, as they marched into battle with a
      slogan which did not transcend the bounds of bourgeois
      democracy. It is not accidental that the executive committee of
      &#147;Narodnaya Volya&#148;, the leading Narodnik organisation,
      addressed in its day an open letter to Lincoln.</p>

    <p>We are even ready to take our hats off to the Decembrists as
    well, that earlier generation of bourgeois revolutionaries which
    also entered the struggle against Tsarism. These men who formed,
    in the literal sense of the word, the cream of the aristocracy,
    nobility and the officer caste, detached themselves from their
    class, broke from their families, abandoned their privileges and
    joined battle with autocracy. Although they did not have a
    socialist programme and although they were only bourgeois
    revolutionaries our generation does not renounce this heritage. On
    the contrary, we say that this is a glorious past and we bow low
    before the first representatives of revolutionary populism, who
    knew how to die for the people in the days when the working class
    was still only being born, when there was no proletariat and there
    could not be a proletarian class party. But at the same time we
    know that between Zhelyabov and Perovskaya on the one hand and
    Gotz and Chernov on the other, there exists just as great a
    difference as between Robespierre and Marat on the one hand and
    Poincaré and Briand on the other. Gotz and Chernov said that
    they were pursuing the casse of populism. But we said to them:
    &#147;You are pursuing it in the same way as Briand and
    Poincaré are pursuing the cause of Marat and
    Robespierre&#148;.</p>

    <p>Let me repeat, if we are speaking about individual people then
    among the Narodniks of the first period who were stars of the
    first magnitude, people who will for ever remain for us
    ineffaceable examples of self-sacrifice, heroism and enormous
    dedication to their people. But if we put this movement under a
    magnifying glass and examine it in the proper way we will find
    that, while remaining in general a great step forward, it was not
    a proletarian movement.</p>

<a name="11"></a>
<H2>Prehistory of the Russian Proletariat</H2>
    <p>Our proletariat was born in the course of long decades: one
      could even say over the course of a century. In Martov&#146;s
      book <I>The History of Russian Social-Democracy </I>which
      despite its Menshevik standpoint I recommend you to read, you
      can find side by side with erroneous Menshevik views many
      interesting facts. The Russian working class began to be born in
      the eighteenth century. The first large-scale factories and the
      first substantial workshops arose in Russia in precisely this
      era. At the same time the first bondsmen, semi-bondsmen and
      afterwards the so-called free workers separated themselves out
      from the class of peasant, handicraft and artisan serfs.</p>

    <p>If you take a look at a work such as Tugan-Baranovsky&#146;s
    well-known study, which does not stand up to a Marxist critique
    but does provide a multitude of facts, and, if you study Comrade
    Lenin&#146;s book <I>The Development of Capitalism in Russia
    </I>and become familiar with Struve&#146;s works, you will see
    that the first workers&#146; movements can be attested in the
    eighteenth century and the subsequent years.</p>

    <p>In 1796 disturbances of factory workers occurred in Kazan, in
    Moscow Province in 1797, in Kazan again in 1798 and 1800 and in
    Moscow Province and in Yaroslavl in 1806<B>, </B>in Tambov
    Province in 1811, in Kaluga Province in 1814, in Yaroslavl in
    1815, in St. Petersburg Province in 1816, again in Yaroslavl and
    Kazan in 1817, in Yaroslavl in 1818, in Kazan in 1819, in Voronezh
    and Kaluga provinces in 1821, in Vladimir and Moscow provinces and
    in Yaroslavl in 1823, in Kazan in 1829, in Kazan and Moscow
    Province in 1834, in Kazan in 1836, in Tula Province in 1837, in
    Moscow Province in 1844 and in Voronezh Province in 1851.</p>

    <p>Besides, scholars who have researched into the Decembrist
    rising can prove by pointing to authentic documents that, at the
    moment of the emergence of the movement of 1825 (a hundred years
    ago), standing in the crowds on the Senate Square were
    St. Petersburg factory operatives who in small numbers then worked
    in St. Petersburg and who openly expressed their sympathy with the
    insurgents when the troops turned out against Nikolai I.</p>

    <p>In 1845 Nikolai&#146;s government was compelled to issue the
    first law instituting criminal penalties for striking. In 1848 the
    storm of the bourgeois revolution rolled across the whole of
    Europe. This movement did not directly affect Russia except
    inasmuch as the Tsarist government sent feudal forces to quell the
    Hungarian revolution; nevertheless it was of course obliquely
    reflected in our country too. So a fresh breeze blew through
    Russia as well.</p>

    <p>Another basic date is 1861, the year of the emancipation of the
    serfs  &mdash;  and the incipient movement of the liberal
    bourgeoisie. Gradually a fairly considerable working class began
    to appear in Russia which acquired the character of a mass
    phenomenon as early as the 1870s. Yet despite this the first
    circles of revolutionaries which arose after the Decembrists were
    not composed of workers.</p>

<a name="12"></a>
<H2>Chaikovsky&#146;s Circle</H2>
    <p>Formed in 1869, Chaikovsky&#146;s circle can be considered the
      first revolutionary group. Perovskaya, Natanson, Volkhovsky,
      Shishko, Kropotkin and Kravchinsky became members of it. These
      names are in themselves distinguished to the highest
      degree. Chaikovsky has lived on until our day although
      politically he has been long since dead. He took part in the
      bourgeois revolution of 1917, was a member of the first
      Executive Committee (of the Congress of Soviets) and then
      occupied a place on the extreme right (even further to the right
      than the Mensheviks and the S.R.s). During the unprecedented
      campaign of slander against Comrade Lenin when the latter was
      declared to be a spy, Chaikovsky was half the instigator of that
      affair. After this he was appointed governor by the British in
      Archangel, kept company with Kolchak and today finds himself in
      Paris, tossed into the dustbin of history.</p>

    <p>Perovskaya as you know perished in 1881. She took part in
    preparing the assassination of Alexander II and entered the
    history of the revolutionary movement as one of its most brilliant
    names. M. Natanson died very recently as a Left S.R. who came very
    close to us, especially after the famous and absurd uprising that
    the Left S.R.s mounted against us. He had split away from the
    Right S.R.s at the start of the revolution, was together with us
    at Zimmerwald and represents to a certain measure a founder of the
    Third International. The remaining members of Chaikovsky&#146;s
    organisation have died either physically  &mdash; or politically,
    as they stayed in the S.R. party.</p>

    <p>This little circle shows distinctly how populism developed and
    how it provided ideologists for various groups. Kropotkin ended up
    an anarchist while Natanson was an internationalist and very close
    to the communists. Chaikovsky revealed himself to be a definite
    representative of the bourgeoisie and nobody will nowadays dispute
    the fact that he was merely a bourgeois revolutionary and at that
    a mediocre and poor democrat, not being even able to defend
    genuine bourgeois democracy; he did not achieve a hundredth part
    of what the real bourgeois revolutionaries accomplished when they
    made their bourgeois revolution.</p>

    <p>The first workers&#146; circle was formed approximately in the
    middle of the 1870s, in about 1875. Its most notable participants
    were Petr Alexeev, the weaver, Malinovsky, Agapov, Alexandrov,
    Krylov and Gerasimov. Those are the principal names. Petr
    Alexeev&#146;s celebrated speech is well-known and also some of
    his contemporaries are still alive  &mdash;  if I am not mistaken
    we recently met Moiseenko.</p>

<a name="13"></a>
<H2>The &#147;South Russian Worker&#146;s League&#148;</H2>
    <p>In 1875 Zaslavsky founded the &#147;South Russian Workers&#146;
      League&#148; in Odessa. But its programme was not as clear as
      the programme of the &#147;North Russian Workers&#146;
      League&#148; founded some three years later. Expressed from the
      very start in this situation was perhaps that enormous
      difference which existed between the north and south and which
      you can trace through the subsequent course of the whole of our
      revolution as well. Today it cannot be doubted that the north
      will enter the history of our revolution as a revolutionary
      section of the Russian proletariat, while all of the
      counter-revolution was fledged chiefly in the south where it
      continually bred and accumulated its forces.</p>

    <p>This disparity of social stratification evidently left a
    certain imprint on the first workers&#146; organisations: the
    South Russian and the North Russian. If we compare the programmes
    of the former and the latter then we will see that the &#147;North
    Russian Workers&#146; League&#148; was without doubt far closer to
    us and revolutionary truth, and it will become clear to us that it
    was more advanced in its estimation of the importance of political
    struggle and its approach to the mass revolutionary workers&#146;
    movement.</p>

<a name="14"></a>
<H2>Marxism and Populism</H2>
    <p>To gain a clearer understanding of the inter-relation between
      populism and Marxism it is necessary to bear in mind the canvas
      upon which it appeared: in the first place, the absence of a
      substantial working class which then consisted of only tiny
      streams, whose sources, it is true, rose before the end of the
      eighteenth century, but which thereafter lay under the heavy
      oppressive weight of autocracy at a time when all cats were
      grey, so to speak. The ultimate threads of this canvas consisted
      of the journey out to the people &mdash; which meant a journey
      out to the peasantry with a very confused programme, the courage
      of the revolutionaries of that time coupled with a lack of a
      proletarian viewpoint, the formation of the first circles made
      up of intellectuals, and only in 1875 the appearance of the
      first workers&#146; circles which were in all their ideology
      still closely connected with populism.</p>

    <p>I have already spoken about Chaikovsky. This man, as it were,
    personifies the finger and thumb of populism. The Chaikovsky of
    the end of the 1860s and beginning of the 1870s was the
    standard-bearer of the best part of the revolutionary
    intelligentsia, a political leader who laid the basis of the
    revolutionary movement. But the Chaikovsky of the 1920s represents
    quite definitely a tool, and a miserable little one at that, in
    the hands of Kolchak and the British bourgeoisie. Thus you can see
    in the figure of one man both sides of populism. And in reality
    right from its beginning to its end two trends, two currents and
    two tendencies clearly revealed themselves in this movement. One
    of them brought forward Zhelyabov and Perovskaya and created
    heroes: the Sazonovs and the Balmashevs. The second current
    especially observable in the 1880s formed the right wing of
    populism, i.e. those Narodniks who both in their practical
    activity and in their writings were little distinguishable from
    the liberals.</p>

    <p>The populism of the 1 870s taken as a whole represents a
    tendency of bourgeois revolutionaries which had however important
    merits. The victorious proletariat will always pay homage to these
    revolutionaries. But it will say at the same time:
    &#147;Don&#146;t imitate their weaknesses, don&#146;t repeat their
    nebulous phrases about the people but speak about a class, go to
    the proletariat and know that the industrial proletariat is the
    fundamental class which will liberate all humanity.&#148; The
    Narodniks could not help being weak, unclear and vague for they
    lived at a time when the working class was only just being born
    and still lay in diapers. From them we must take not the fog which
    enshrouded them but what was their strength: be dedicated to
    one&#146;s people, serve it as selflessly as they did; be
    courageous and self-sacrificing; break as they did from class
    prejudices and privileges; know how to go against the current at a
    difficult moment, as they knew how to. The darker the night the
    brighter the stars. The darker the Tsarist night was, the brighter
    shone the stars that were Zhelyabov and Perovskaya. And the
    Russian working class which has been victorious in struggle and
    workers of all the world respect them for this.</p>

<a name="15"></a>
<H2>Bourgeois and Proletarian Revolutionaries</H2>
    <p>We know moreover that within populism, which began in the 1870s
      and continued into the 1880s, there was a liberal,
      functionary-class current which animated a number of literary
      tendencies which were close to the ideas of liberalism and which
      subsequently drew the S.R. party towards the evolution which we
      have observed. Into precisely this framework were born the first
      groups of proletarian revolutionaries who laid the foundation of
      our party. You must bear in mind and you must clearly remember
      that there are both bourgeois revolutionaries and proletarian
      ones. Only when we are clear on this fact can we understand the
      Ovid-like metamorphosis of the S.R. party. For it was just when
      it was a question of a victory over Tsarism and the bourgeois
      revolution that these revolutionaries had sweep, energy,
      enthusiasm and gusto; they knew what they were fighting for and
      what they made sacrifices for and produced great men like
      Gershuni. But when the bourgeois revolution had been finished in
      the rough, and the job of the proletarian revolution started,
      everything which the day before had been their strength became
      the next day their weakness. They had become more dangerous to
      us than the usual bourgeois counter-revolutionaries because they
      immediately turned their energy, dexterity, conspiratorial
      talent and their certain rapport with the masses through 90
      degrees to oppose the revolutionary class. And here lies the
      solution to the whole riddle.</p>

    <p>In all the evolution of the S.R.s and in all the metamorphoses
    of populism we must distinguish two factors. For a certain period
    they were bourgeois revolutionaries. They were a progressive force
    and we had to support them and to proceed in a united front
    together with them over many years against autocracy. But they
    were a progressive force only until the moment that the working
    class, having toppled the privileged property-based class, the
    class of landowners and bourgeois, reached for power. From this
    moment as soon as we passed on to the urgent questions regardless
    of the landowners and the bourgeoisie, the S.R.s immediately swung
    their whole front against the workers and against the proletarian
    revolution.</p>

<a name="16"></a>
<H2>Struggle between proletarian and bourgeois revolutionaries</H2>
    <p>All the first phase of the history of our party is nothing
      other than at first a semi-conscious and then a fully-conscious
      struggle of proletarian revolutionaries against bourgeois
      revolutionaries. In so far as it was a case of a struggle
      against Tsarism we had, I repeat, a united front. But as soon as
      the struggle to win the masses and the soul of the working class
      was unleashed, our paths diverged. From this moment the
      proletarian revolutionaries grappled with the bourgeois
      revolutionaries, and this struggle filled a number of years
      which proved to be decisive for the future of Russia.</p>
