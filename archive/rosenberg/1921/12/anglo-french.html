<p class="fst">Stinnes was in London. It is not certain whether Lloyd George spoke to him or not. It seems that the German visitors rouse in the English ministers the same emotion which Heine expressed in verse:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Blame me not, my lovely child, but greet me not on &lsquo;Unter den Linden&rsquo;. When we&rsquo;re at home everything will be all explained.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">At any rate, official assurance comes from the English side, that Lloyd George did not receive Stinnes. This denial has about as much value as official denials usually have. But the very fact that the English government has issued such a statement, proves that it must be considerate of France&rsquo;s feelings in this matter; and it is. The government press at Paris sounded an alarm at Stinnes&rsquo; trip to London. Stinnes was characterized by it as the Pan-German leader whose only dream is the subjugation of Russia, and who wants to carry on the war of revenge against the Allies, with the aid of the gigantic eastern power. The London report that Lloyd George scorned the visit of Hugo Stinnes was received with approbation at Paris.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile other reports are reaching France. From these reports it seems that Stinnes and Rathenau must have spoken with certain influential British personages, and that these interviews bore some very substantial results. No less than three official communications reached Paris in one day. One of these came through the Reuter Agency, and intimated that England and France were still far from an agreement in the Turkish question. Another Reuter dispatch called attention to the fact that England could not possibly reduce its navy if France does not reduce its army. Thirdly, the English government sent a communication to the Council of Ambassadors in Paris, in which it recommends the repeal of the military sanctions on the Rhine, and proposes the curtailing of allied military control in Germany. When it is suggested to the French that they evacuate D&uuml;sseldorf, Duisburg and Ruhrort, they at once become nervous. And when the recommendation is made that they limit General Nollet&rsquo;s staff, they become still more nervous. Both of these ideas, namely, the evacuation of the Rhine cities, and the limiting of the Commission of Allied Control in Germany, were entertained by the English government for a long time. But Briand&rsquo;s energetic opposition prevented their being carried out. The fact that England again raises these two questions, shows that it wishes to have the German question thoroughly settled anew. Moreover, it is clear that England acts as spokesman for the German bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>Nothing official is yet known from English quarters on the question of the famous moratorium plan. But the well informed London <strong>Daily Mail</strong> declares that the English government was busy with the question of the German debt, especially with the payment of 500,000,000 gold marks, which are due on the 15th of January.</p>

<p>The English government realises that the depreciation of the German mark is due to the continual gold payments made by Germany. Again, the low value of the German mark makes it absolutely impossible for English goods to enter the German market. This condition can be overcome only by freeing Germany for some time from the obligation of making gold payments. Hence, a moratorium of two or three years may be granted it. So far, the English government has undoubtedly accepted all the proposals made by the German bourgeoisie. A few days ago, the English Ambassador in Berlin, Lord D&rsquo;Abernon, whose relations with the Stinnes group are well known, likewise left for London where he will collaborate in the government action which is in preparation there.</p>

<p>The English government however, and the capitalist circles which are behind it, do not confine their plans to financial questions. The best minds of the English bourgeoisie have for some time been busy looking for a solution for the economic crisis of their country. They seek to increase England&rsquo;s production at all costs. The burden of taxation is therefore to be lightened in every possible way. This is the main reason why England is ready to accept naval disarmament Furthermore, new markets are to be won, and in connection with this project Germany&rsquo;s foreign exchange is to be saved in order that it may become a buyer of English goods. But the English bourgeoisie wants still more; and Stinnes also wants very much more. England&rsquo;s chief concern is still one of preventing France from getting control of all the essential coal and iron regions of Central and Western Europe. French capital seeks to intrench itself in the German coal mines and in German industry, and thus to establish a great French industrial power in Europe, against which England would be powerless. England opposes this with all its might. France wants to expropriate the large German industries; England wants to aid them. English capital is ready to participate in German industry in any form whatever. The Stinnes plan of having the large German industries rob the Government of the railroads, and then borrowing English gold on this booty, seems to find favor in London. Again, the Stinnes project of a joint Anglo-German penetration of Russia, is only a rebirth of old English plans.</p>

<p>The realization of these projects would place great obstacles in the way of the French attempt to dominate Europe politically and economically. As soon as the English flag waves over the German factories, the French would be left with empty hands. France wishes to put through the Russian coup all by itself. Indeed, it does not want to deal with the Soviet government; it will seek to restore the Russian Monarchy first The restored Russian empire is also to become a French colony, as the republics of Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc., already are.</p>

<p>Stinnes believes himself to be the industrial Napoleon of these times; but unfortunately, he has the militaristic Napoleon of today &ndash; Marshall Foch &ndash; against him. The most cunning Stinnes projects and the warmest approbations of London fall to the ground when Foch begins to march. France does not at all intend to make any concessions to England in the German of the Turkish questions, or in the disarmament proposition. The capitalist press of Paris declares that if England desires peace in the Orient, &ldquo;it should please be so kind&rdquo; as to have its Greek friends completely evacuate Asia Minor. Furthermore, if England has suddenly lost all enthusiasm for the naval disarmament plans of Hughes &ndash; this is possibly correct because Japan&rsquo;s antagonistic attitude frustrates the whole disarmament project &ndash; then she may build as many ships as she pleases, but it should not shift the blame for the Washington failure upon France. And as far as the moratorium for Germany is concerned, France declares that in the next few years it will not be able to bear a postponement of the German payments. If some people insist upon relieving the German financial situation, they must furnish a substitute to France; this means that America and England should pay France the amounts which Germany was otherwise to pay. Since the Anglo-Saxons on both sides of the Atlantic are politely declining to play the part of the &ldquo;rich uncle&rdquo;, the whole moratorium plan has come to naught.</p>

<p>To do without a moratorium for the enormous German obligations in the next few years is also more than the English financial world can stand; especially when the failure of the Washington Conference becomes more probable from day to day. England must therefore be careful not to waste its capital assets.</p>

<p>Nothing short of a miracle must take place in Paris, to enable Stinnes and his English friends to reach their goal. We will wait and see whether the miracle takes place or not.</p>
