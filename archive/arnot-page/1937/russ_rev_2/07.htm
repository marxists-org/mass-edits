<h3>What to Read Next</h3>

<p class="fst">THE BEST SOURCE OF INFORMATION about the Russian Revolution is the first-hand information contained in the works of Lenin and Stalin. Lenin&#8217;s <em>Selected Works</em>, in twelve volumes, are now being published by Lawrence &amp; Wishart at 5<em>s</em>. each (with a special Left Book Club edition at 3s. 4d.). Stalin&#8217;s <em>Leninism</em>, published in two volumes by Allen &amp; Unwin, Volume I at 7<em>s</em>. 6<em>d</em>., Volume II at 7<em>s</em>. 6<em>d</em>., has to be supplemented (until the third volume appears) by sundry pamphlets containing writings and speeches from the end of 1931 onwards a list is obtainable from the Workers&#8217; Bookshops, Collett&#8217;s Bookshops, etc. For a fuller understanding of the Russian Revolution it is indispensable to read Marx and Engels; for which, to begin with, procure the <em>Handbook of Marxism</em> (1,088 pp.), edited by Emile Burns, and published by Victor Gollancz Ltd. at 5<em>s</em>., with a special Left Book Club edition at 2<em>s</em>. 6<em>d</em>.: a similar <em>Handbook of Leninism</em> is shortly to be published. A <em>History of the Civil War</em> is being published this year. Otherwise there is no trustworthy history available in English; for Trotsky&#8217;s <a href="../../../trotsky/1930/hrr/index.htm">&#8220;three-decker&#8221;</a> is Trotskyist propaganda in disguise. Pokrovsky&#8217;s <em>Short History of Russia</em> has the defect of stopping after 1905
</p>
<p>
Of books written in England, the most authoritative is <em>Soviet Communism</em>, by Beatrice and Sidney Webb, written from the Fabian standpoint and now published in a cheap edition for the Left Book Club at 5<em>s</em>.
