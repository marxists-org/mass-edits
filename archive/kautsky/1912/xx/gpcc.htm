<h4>1. Gold Production and the High Cost of Living</h4>

<p class="fst">The high cost of living has become such a
long-standing and conspicuous phenomenon that the investigation of its
causes occupies economists from the most different tendencies and
schools. Among other things, the revolutionizing of gold production has
been mentioned as one of the causes of the high cost of living. Otto
Bauer, in his work on the high cost of living&nbsp;<a id="f1" href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>, has accepted this
view, and I myself have done the same, at least conditionally. However
neither Bauer nor myself, nor, as far as I know, any other socialist
theoretician, has considered the reduction in the production cost of
gold as the only cause of the high cost of living, or even the basic
one. In my article on the mass action I identified as causes of the
high cost of living:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;[...] the inflationary
effects of private property on land in America, which was strengthened
by the consequences of the exhaustive cultivation of the soil in Russia
and America, by the rise of syndicates of producers and merchants, and
perhaps also the revolutionizing of gold production. Technical
improvements and the finding of new gold mines have perhaps caused the
production costs of gold, and with them its value, to fall more rapidly
than the value of consumer goods, because as a consequence of the
obstructions created by private property on land, the preservation of
technically backward small farms, and the migration of agricultural
workers, the productivity of agriculture grows slowly. If we add to
this the growth of protective tariffs as well as the tax increases of
the last years, one has a pretty exhaustive description of the causes
of the high cost of living. They are all of a lasting nature. The
ruling classes will not give up willingly even the agrarian tariffs and
the tax hikes, because they are the necessary consequence of the
imperialist colonial and arms fever that has taken possession of
capitalism.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f2" href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Varga, in his recent article on gold
production and the high cost of living in <strong>Die Neue Zeit</strong>,
argued against the view that the value of gold has sunk as a
consequence of the reduction in its production costs.&nbsp;<a id="f3" href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> He
believes not only that the value of gold has actually not fallen, which
is perhaps correct, but also that it is impossible that the value of
gold could fall. The changes in the conditions of production of gold
could not therefore in any case be a cause of the high cost of living.</p>

<p>Hilferding accepts this argument and seeks to give it a deeper
theoretical foundation in his article on gold and commodity.&nbsp;<a id="f4" href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> His
theory is bold and apparently very well thought out, but also so
paradoxical, that it requires further verification. This investigation
must first all cover the theory of paper money, which Hilferding
developed in his <strong>Finance Capital</strong>, and
which he now turns into the foundation of his theory about the
unchangeable value of gold.</p>

<p>I pointed out already in my review of Hilferding&#8217;s
Finance Capital that his theory of paper money seemed to me
untenable.&nbsp;<a id="f5" href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
I thought I had to confine myself to that appraisal and abstain from a
detailed refutation, first because my review was already so extensive,
and also because I should have had to enter into the details of the
theory of money, which most of the readers would easily have mistaken
for hair-splitting. One does not deal with a subject like that in a
popular journal without a good reason. There seemed to be no pressing
need for a debate on that issue, because paper money plays no role in
Hilferding&#8217;s book, and therefore does not impair its great
merits. Hilferding himself declared it to be unrealizable in practice.
I therefore felt entitled to consider it as a purely
&#8220;academic whim.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hilferding&#8217;s latest article however shows that the
notions out of which he developed his ideas on paper currency can have
greater significance. He made them the basis of an analysis that could
have crucial significance for answering the most important economic
question of our time&#8212;the high cost of living&#8212;but
that in addition, if it is indeed true, strikes at the heart of our
theory of value.</p>

<p>We will now attempt to investigate if that is the case.<br />

&nbsp;</p>

<h4>2. Paper Currency</h4>

<p class="fst">Let us first of all hear Hilferding
himself. He says in his <strong>Finance Capital</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Let us first envisage a
system of pure paper currency (as legal tender). Let us assume that, at
a given time, circulation requires 5,000,000 marks for which 3600
pounds of gold would be needed.&nbsp;<a id="f6" href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> We should then have a total
circulation as follows: 5,000,000 marks in C&#8212;5,000,000 marks
in M&#8212;5,000,000 marks in C. If paper tokens were substituted
for gold, their sum would have to represent the total value of
commodities (5,000,000 marks in this case) whatever their nominal
value. In other words, if 5,000 notes of equal value were printed, each
note would be worth 1,000 marks; if 100,000 notes were printed, each
would be worth 50 marks. If the velocity of circulation remained
constant and the sum of prices were to double without any corresponding
change in the quantity of paper money, the value of the paper would
rise to 10,000,000 marks; per contra, if the sum of prices were to
decline by one half, the value of the paper would fall to 2,500,000
marks. In other words, under a system of pure legal-tender paper
currency, given a constant velocity of circulation, the value of paper
money is determined by the total price of all the commodities in
circulation. The value of paper money in such circumstances is
completely independent of the value of gold and reflects directly the
value of commodities, in accordance with the law that its total amount
represents value equal to the sum of commodity prices divided by the
number of monetary units of equal denomination in circulation. It is
obvious that paper money can appreciate as well as depreciate in
relation to its original value.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f7" href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Hilferding then refers to the experiences
of different countries in which, with the cessation of free coinage of
silver, the value of the silver coins exceeded their metal value, which
is supposed to corroborate his views, and finally comes to the
following conclusion:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Money continues to serve as a
&#8216;measure of value.&#8217; But the magnitude of its value
is no longer determined by the value of the constituent commodity,
gold, silver, or paper. Instead, its &#8216;value&#8217; is
really determined by the total value of the commodities in circulation,
assuming the velocity of circulation to be constant. The real measure
of value is not money. On the contrary, the &#8216;value&#8217;
of money is determined by what I would call the socially necessary
circulation value. If we also take account of the fact that money is a
medium of circulation&#8230;this socially necessary circulation
value can be expressed in the formula:</p>

<table align="center" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

  <tbody>

    <tr valign="middle">

      <td>
      <p class="smc"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total
value of
commodities&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />

velocity of circulation of money</p>

      </td>

      <td>
      <p class="smc">+ the sum of payments falling due
&#8722; the payments</p>

      </td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="quoteb">which cancel each other out, minus
finally the number of turnovers in which the same piece of money
functions alternately as a means of circulation and as a means of
payment.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f8" href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Let us look more closely into those
remarks. The first sentence already contains the seeds of a
misunderstanding. He says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Let us assume that, at a
given time, circulation requires 5,000,000 marks for which 3600 pounds
of gold would be needed.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f9" href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">According to this idea one could suppose
that 5 million marks and 3,600 pounds of gold are two different things.
Gold would be the means for bringing 5 million marks into circulation.
Actually 5 million marks are nothing but 3,600 pounds of gold. The
former is identical with the latter, and can be nothing else. What
circulation required were the 3,600 pounds of gold. The fact that
people call <sup><small>1</small></sup>/<small><small>1395</small></small>
pounds of gold a mark, and that 3,600 pounds of gold are called 5
million marks, is circumstantial.</p>

<p>Hilferding&#8217;s sentence is not yet false, but carries
the seed of potentially mistaken views. The following sentence is more
significant:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We should then have a total
circulation as follows: 5,000,000 marks in C&#8212;5,000,000 marks
in M&#8212;5,000,000 marks in C.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f10" href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Marx employed the formula
C&#8211;M&#8211;C to denote the circulation of commodities. The
commodity producer comes to the market with a commodity C, which
represents a certain amount of value.</p>

<p>He sells it, exchanging it against a certain amount of bullion
M, with has the same value as commodity C, and buys with that amount of
money other commodities of the same value, which is why Marx called
that commodity also C, although as use value it represents something
completely different from the first commodity.</p>

<p>It is clear that C does not represent in Marx&#8217;s
formula a determined amount of money, but of commodities. Had he wanted
to denote C concretely, he would have written down a certain weight or
number of commodities, such as 40 pounds of coffee, 2 meters of fabric
or half a ton of iron. It would not have occurred to him to denote 5
million marks with C. Five million marks denote, as we know, only a
certain amount of a particular commodity, gold, measured by weight. It
would be senseless to say that in the circulation of commodities for
instance 1,360 pounds of gold in coffee are exchanged against 1,360
pounds of gold in gold, and again against 1,360 pounds of gold in iron.</p>

<p>Even more critical however is the following thing.
C&#8211;M&#8211;C is the formula for the circulation of <em>particular</em>
commodities. What Hilferding wants to represent by it, however, is not
the <em>circulation of particular commodities</em> but the
circulation of the entire mass of gold and commodities in society. But
that is the result of numerous circulation processes, which are
intertwined in the most diverse ways, and which cannot be collectively
represented by the formula C&#8211;M&#8211;C. In that formula,
the value of C must be always equal to M. In contrast, the total value
of the money in circulation is almost never equal to the total value of
the commodities in circulation.</p>

<p>Hilferding knows all that as well as I do. A few lines later
he mentions Marx&#8217;s formula for the amount of money in
circulation. When, despite that, he employs the formula (5 million in)
C&#8211;(5 million in) M&#8211;(5 million in) C, that is
apparently only a mistake, which could be overlooked if it were not the
foundation for further errors. Hilferding continues:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If gold were replaced by
paper notes, their sum would have to represent the total value of
commodities (5,000,000 marks in this case) whatever their nominal
value.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f11" href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This is the first serious mistake resulting
from his inexact wording. Hilferding&#8217;s unusually confusing
style is already striking: &#8220;whatever their nominal
value.&#8221; Why does he not express himself more clearly? What
can then be printed on the paper signs? Surely not quotations from the
German classics, like in modern toilet paper? Only one thing can be
printed on them which matters here: how much <em>gold</em>
they represent. On each note is always printed <em>which weight
in gold</em> it represents. Let us not forget that.</p>

<p>No less confusing than the expression &#8220;whatever
their nominal value&#8221; is the following one: &#8220;their
sum would have to represent the total value of commodities.&#8221;
The sum of paper notes? But they cannot represent any value. It is not
a question of a sum of <em>notes</em> but of the sum of <em>gold
quantities</em> that they represent. Hilferding is clearly
attempting, by means of clumsy and vague phrases, to detach paper money
from its connection to gold. Then he takes nonchalantly the decisive
step by claiming with the greatest calm, as a self-understood thing,
that &#8220;their sum [of paper notes] would have to represent the <em>total
value of the commodities</em> ... whatever their nominal
value.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If gold were replaced by paper notes,&#8221;
paper money would always serve as a representation of gold, a certain
amount of gold, not as a representation of commodities. The sum of
value that the total amount of notes represents must always be equal to
the sum of gold they supersede. In Hilferding&#8217;s example that
sum is admittedly equal to the sum of values of commodities in
circulation. Still, that does not mean that the sum [of values of the
total amount of notes] also represents the sum of value of commodities,
when the former deviates from the sum of value of gold required for
commodity circulation.</p>

<p>If gold were replaced by paper notes, these would denote
certain amounts of gold, not of commodity values. They denote M, not C.
Whatever amount of gold they may nominally represent, it can actually
be no greater than the amount required by the needs of circulation.</p>

<p>Hilferding can argue that all this is pure pedantry. The
amount of gold required by the needs of commodity circulation depends
on the sum of values of the commodities thrown into circulation. The
larger this sum, the greater will be the amount of gold required. All
other circumstances being equal, both sums stand at a fixed ratio.</p>

<p>Marx himself said in <strong>Capital</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;On this supposition then, the
quantity of the medium of circulation is determined by the sum of the
prices that have to be realised.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f12" href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Does not what Hilferding said amount to the
same things? Not at all, because Marx said that his proposition is true
under certain circumstances. The purpose of Hilferding&#8217;s
argumentation is precisely to remove that premise, which Marx
formulated as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Henceforth we shall consider
the value of gold to be given, as, in fact, it is momentarily whenever
we estimate the price of a commodity.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f13" href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In contrast, Hilferding wants to
demonstrate that the value of paper money is independent of the value
of gold, and that the total value that paper money represents is
determined <em>directly, immediately</em> by the value of
the mass of commodities confronting it (with the same velocity of
circulation).</p>

<p>According to Marx the value of paper money is determined by
the value of the mass of commodities confronting it, but this process
is mediated in Marx&#8217;s analysis by gold, which is indeed
replaced bodily by paper currency, but that still functions as measure
of value and therefore as represented gold.</p>

<p>The opposition between the analyses of Marx and Hilferding
emerges clearly in this footnote to <strong>Finance Capital</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It seems to me that Marx
formulates the law of paper currency (or any currency with suspended
coinage) most correctly when he says: &#8216;Worthless tokens
become tokens of value only when they represent gold within the process
of circulation, and they can represent it only to the amount of gold
which would circulate as coin, an amount which depends on the value of
gold if the exchange-value of the commodities and the velocity of their
metamorphoses are given.&#8217;&nbsp;<a id="f14" href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> The detour by
which Marx proceeds&#8212;first determining the value of the
quantity of coins and then, from that, the value of the paper
money&#8212;seems superfluous. The purely social character of that
determination is far more clearly expressed when the value of paper
money is derived directly from the social circulation value. The fact
that, historically, paper currency had its origin in metal currency is
not a reason for degrading it in this way theoretically. The value of
paper money must be deducible without reference to metallic
money.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f15" href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p>Here the contradiction between Marx and Hilferding becomes
clear. Hilferding thinks that the value of paper currency <em>must</em>
be derived from the value of the commodities, with no connection to
gold. &#8220;Must&#8221; is a hard nut to crack, but in science
there is no &#8220;<em>sic volo, sic jubeo</em>&#8221;
[&#8216;this I will, this I command&#8217;].&nbsp;<a id="f16" href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a>
There only <em>ratio</em> decides. And there
Hilferding&#8217;s attempt to get rid of gold is not very
convincing. He wants to disconnect gold from the determination of the
value of paper money, and determine the latter directly through the
value of commodities. But, without noticing it, he only succeeds in
doing that by implicitly presupposing the measurement of the value of
commodities through gold&#8212;in other words, by equating value
and price. His entire deduction is erected on the presupposition that
so many marks are not a determination of price but of value. But Marx
did not dispute that the value of paper money in circulation is
determined by the <em>sum of prices</em> of commodities.
The way from value to price is precisely the
&#8220;detour&#8221; that Marx adopted. Hilferding spares
himself that &#8220;superfluous&#8221; detour by regarding
price and value as equivalent. This error leads him to argue that 5
million marks and 3,600 pounds of gold are different things, and to
replace the formula C&#8211;M&#8211;C for the formula (5
million marks in) C&#821;(5 million marks in) M&#8211;(5
million marks in) C.</p>

<p>Marx said: Under the presupposition of a given value of gold,
the mass of means of circulation is determined by the sum of prices of
commodities to be realized. Hilferding, in contrast, declares that the
sum of money notes &#8220;must always represent the sum of value of
the commodities, and therefore in our case must be equal to 5 million
marks.&#8221; Those 5 million marks are not a sum of values, but of
prices. Value is determined by the socially necessary labour time. If a
socially necessary labour time of 5 million hours of work goes into the
production of a given mass of commodities, its value will be
accordingly high. If an hour of labour produces <sup><small>1</small></sup>/<small><small>1395</small></small>
pounds of gold, and if one calls that amount of gold a mark, one can
also say that the sum of value of the mass of commodities amounts to 5
million marks. Strictly speaking, however, this is not a sum of values
but of prices, i.e. a determined quantity of values expressed by a
certain amount of gold, against which it is exchanged. Value and price
are by no means the same thing, although to simplify matters one can
sometimes equate one with the other. But one must not forget that the
expression of the value of a commodity in money presupposes the value
of the latter, and that it is senseless without this presupposition. It
is always more accurate to call such an expression price.</p>

<p>Why does then Hilferding talk about a sum of values rather
than a sum of prices? The sum of value of commodities is given; it is
independent from the value of gold. The sum of prices, by contrast,
presupposes not only a certain value of commodities, but also a certain
value of gold. Equating the sum of values to the sum of prices enables
Hilferding to make the price as well as the value of commodities
independent from the presupposition of a given value of money.</p>

<p>This equation of value and price is the basis of
Hilferding&#8217;s theory. He continues:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If 5,000 equal notes were
printed, each would be worth 1,000 marks; if 100,000 notes were
printed, each would be worth 50 marks. If the velocity of circulation
remained constant and <em>the sum of prices</em> of
commodities were to double without any corresponding change in the
quantity of paper money, the value of the notes would rise to
10,000,000 marks; per contra, if the sum of prices were to decline by
one half, the value of the notes would fall to 2,500,000
marks.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f17" href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Here apparently every connection between
money and gold has disappeared. We have on one side a mass of
commodities, and on the other a mass of paper notes. The value of the
paper notes depends on the value of the mass of commodities and on the
amount of paper notes. Gold seems to have been totally eliminated. And
yet the im7portunate metal intrudes again and again also into this nice
paper economy.</p>

<p>What do we have according to Hilferding&#8217;s
presuppositions? A mass of values, a heap of commodities representing
perhaps 5 million working hours, and an amount of nicely printed paper
notes. The paper notes are in themselves valueless; they acquire their
value through the monopoly that the state accords them for the
circulation of commodities. The value of each note is determined by the
value of the commodities that it has to circulate. If only 5,000 notes
are available, each one accounts for 1,000 working hours. If 100,000
notes are thrown into circulation, each represents 70 working hours.</p>

<p>In that form paper currency would be nothing but an inferior
copy of the Utopia of &#8220;labour-money.&#8221; On the latter
Marx said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The question: why does not
money directly represent labour-time, so that a piece of paper may
represent, for instance, X hours&#8217; labour? is at bottom the
same as the question: why, given the production of commodities, must
products take the form of commodities? This is evident, since their
taking the form of commodities implies their differentiation into
commodities and money. Or, why cannot private labour&#8212;labour
for the account of private individuals&#8212;be treated as its
opposite, immediate social labour?&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f18" href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Hilferding avoids answering that unpleasant
question by presenting the sum of values in marks rather than in
working hours. But he may twist and turn as much as he wants: a mark
means a certain amount of gold.</p>

<p>As soon as gold is introduced, the whole thing once again
makes sense. Hilferding assumes a value of commodities of 5 million
marks. That is a definite amount of represented gold; if we understand
by a mark <sup><small>1</small></sup>/<small><small>1395</small></small> pounds of gold, it means approximately 3,600 pounds of
gold. Let us assume that for the circulation of that amount of
commodities an equal amount of gold is required: we have then 3,600
pounds of gold, but in all their corporeality. If those 3,600 pounds of
gold are replaced by notes representing them, their total sum will
amount to 3,600 pounds of gold, whatever their quantity. Each note will
be printed with the explanation, that it is equal to a certain amount
of gold. That is the meaning of the explanation that it is worth 50 or
100 or 1,000 marks. It does not have and cannot have any other meaning.
If more notes were thrown into circulation than required by the
circulation needs, there would be more representations of gold than the
amount of gold that would circulate in their place, and they would be
therefore worth only as much gold as required by the circulation
process. If it requires 5 million gold marks and there is an amount of
paper money representing 10 million gold marks, each note will be worth
half its nominal value, and it will buy no more commodities than that.</p>

<p>Otherwise it is impossible to understand the phrase:
&#8220;If 5,000 equal notes were printed, each would be worth 1,000
marks; if 100,000 notes were printed, each would be worth 50
marks.&#8221; What mark can here be understood but a gold mark?
Besides the paper marks (or mark notes of 50, 100 and 1,000) there are
only gold marks, or at least marks in represented gold. Now, a paper
mark is always worth a paper mark. The statement that 100 paper marks
are worth 50 marks can only mean that they are worth 50 gold marks.</p>

<p>If more paper money were thrown into circulation than required
by the needs of circulation of gold money, the legal tender will
produce double prices: gold prices and paper money prices. Gold always
remains the basis of value measurement; it cannot be eliminated as a
measure of value.</p>

<p>Hilferding denies that. He arrives at this law:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In other words, under a
system of pure legal-tender paper currency, given a constant velocity
of circulation, the value of paper money is determined by the total
price of all the commodities in circulation. The value of paper money
in such circumstances is completely <em>independent of the value</em>
of gold and reflects directly the value of
commodities.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f19" href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The value of money would accordingly be
determined by the sum of commodity prices. But how will the sum of
commodity prices be determined? Apparently by means of the value of
money. It is impossible to say that a commodity is worth 10 marks
before I know what value those 10 marks represent. According to
Hilferding the value of money with paper currency is determined by the
value of commodities compared to the value of money. He fell into this
nice vicious circle because he confused value and price. So could the
appearance emerge, that commodities have not only a certain value
before they are confronted with money, but also a certain price, that
is to say a certain exchange ratio with money, whose value is however
still totally unknown. If that were true, then the value of money could
really originate in the value of commodities and money would
&#8220;directly reflect the value of commodities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hilferding does not explain the crucial question: how can
commodities get a price before determining the value of money? Without
answering it, he reaches the conclusion that with legal tender the
value of money as a measure of value is not determined by the value of
the money-commodity but by what he calls the &#8220;socially
necessary circulation value,&#8221; which is given by the formula:</p>

<table align="center" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

  <tbody>

    <tr valign="middle">

      <td>
      <p class="sm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total

      <td>
      <p class="sm">= total value of money</p>

      </td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="fst">(irrespective of payments, which we do not
want to include here in order to avoid unnecessary complications).</p>

<p>The formula is constructed in imitation of Marx&#8217;s
formula, which reads: &#8220;The quantity of money functioning as
the circulating medium is equal to the sum of the prices of the
commodities divided by the number of moves made by coins of the same
denomination.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f20" href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>Both formulas outwardly say the same, yet they are
fundamentally different.</p>

<p>Marx starts from the sum of prices of commodities, that is to
say their sum of value, expressed in a certain amount of coins, for
instance marks. Let us suppose that the sum of prices of the
commodities turned over daily in a market amounts to 5 million marks.
That number must be divided by the average number of daily moves of
coins of the same denomination. Since the sum of prices of commodities
is assessed in marks, we are considering here only marks, because it is
irrelevant how many particular one-mark coins, twenty-mark coins, etc.
circulate. If each one-mark coin changes hands five times a day through
purchase and sale, a million mark coins will be required to accomplish
those transactions.</p>

<p>But in Marx the value of money, the value of a mark, is
presupposed as given. What changes with the sum of prices of the
commodities and the velocity of circulation of money is not the value
of particular coins, but the number of coins in circulation at the same
time.</p>

<p>All this is clear and simple. In contrast, in
Hilferding&#8217;s formula we have, as already remarked, the sum of
values of commodities, which must be transformed into their sum of
prices even before the value of money is determined. But in order to
determine the value of the sum of money and with it the value of the
particular coins we must take into consideration the velocity of
circulation of money, which is determined by the number of purchases
accomplished within a certain period. That is to say, according to
Hilferding&#8217;s formula money must function first as a measure
of value and then as a means of circulation before determining its
value, which turns it into a measure of value and a means of
circulation. First the vendor determines the price of his commodities,
then they are sold against a certain amount of money, and only then
emerges, as a result of these transactions, how much a particular coin
is worth! The value of money, which must be determined so that the
circulation of commodities (that is to say the exchange of commodities
and money) can begin, is made the result of this exchange!</p>

<p>If I understand Hilferding correctly, and I do not see how his
theory can be understood otherwise, then it is certainly quite
astonishing, but not incomprehensible. It was not made out of thin air,
but represents an attempt to explain certain phenomena about which the
theorists of money have belaboured for decades. Those phenomena are
close to Hilferding because the experiences which his fatherland had
with the gold standard played a prominent role among them. A theory of
the determination of the value of money by the socially necessary
circulation value, the complete independence of the value of money from
the value of gold, is a genuinely Austrian theory. Since the 1870s the
value of silver has fallen very rapidly. That created severe
disturbances in the currencies of all the states that had not adopted
the gold currency. Among those countries where silver currency still
prevailed were Austria and India. Both countries sought relief in the
discontinuation of free silver coinage. They reduced the number of
silver coins in circulation to a certain amount. The result in both
cases was that the price of the silver coins was detached from its
metal value and rose above it. Hilferding explains that by arguing that
the amount of silver money available at the given metal value was not
enough for the needs of commodity circulation. He argues that when the
sum of commodities required 700 million silver florins, and there were
only 600 million in circulation, a silver florin was worth <small><sup>7</sup></small>/<small><small>6</small></small>
of its silver value.</p>

<p>For Hilferding this proves that the value of money with
unredeemable currency is not determined by the intrinsic value of
money, but by the socially necessary circulation value.</p>

<p>The fact to which he refers is undeniable. By abolishing the
free coinage of silver it was indeed possible to raise the rate of
exchange of the silver coins above their metal value.</p>

<p>But under what circumstances did that happen? It happened at a
time when the adoption of a <em>gold currency</em> was
inevitable. The trade of the countries with a silver currency with
those with a gold currency grew in the course of economic development.
Next to silver, gold became increasingly important for the former
countries as well. The situation became more and more intolerable for
them as the previously pretty constant ratio between the value of gold
and the value of silver was upset by the constant fall of the latter.
It became indispensable to confront that situation and that is why the
free coinage of silver was abolished.</p>

<p>Hilferding says for instance about the suspension of free
silver coinage in India:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The object was to raise the
rupee exchange to 16 pence. Under free coinage this rate corresponded
to a silver price of about 43.05 pence. In other words, at that price,
the silver content of the rupee, if melted down and sold, would have
fetched a price of 16 pence on the London (world)
market.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f21" href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When the mints for private coinage were
closed, the silver price was 38 pence; the rate of the rupee was 14<small><sup>7</sup></small>/<small><small>8</small></small>
pence. After silver coinage was discontinued in 1893, it finally
succeeded in bringing the price of the rupee up to 16 pence in 1897,
while the silver value it contained was merely 8.87 pence.</p>

<p>Now, pence are English money, gold money. The rate of exchange
of the Indian rupee is its price expressed in <em>gold</em>.
Therefore one cannot say that silver money, any more than paper money,
is &#8220;completely independent from the value of gold and a
direct reflection of the value of commodities.&#8221; It is
independent from its own metal value, but only because silver as a
measure of value was displaced by another precious metal. It was
therefore a question of fixing the ratio between Indian silver money
and English gold money, which they sought to accomplish by limiting the
amount of Indian silver money in circulation. This measure, however,
would have occurred to nobody, and would indeed have been impossible,
had silver money been the only money. It became possible and desirable
because gold increasingly pushed silver back, especially as a measure
of value, leaving silver to function merely as means of circulation,
and basically confining it to the role of token coins. But token coins
function merely as means of circulation, not as a measure of value. The
value of the silver token coins stood above their metal value, but
nobody would affirm that because of that money needs to have no
intrinsic value, and that this intrinsic value does not determine
commodity prices and with them the amount of money required for the
circulation of commodities. To be sure silver money did not become
completely a token coin with the discontinuation of free coinage. But
this discontinuation was only the first step for Austria and India to
go over to gold currency. In both countries gold is the legal measure
of value.</p>

<p>The experiences with unredeemable silver currency therefore do
not at all show that the value of money as a measure of value is
determined by the socially necessary circulation value rather than by
its own value, which as a metal it has like any other commodity. In
order to be able to prove it, those experiences should have lasted
longer without causing serious disturbances in the circulation of those
countries where the unredeemable metal was the only measure of value.
As long as there is no example of a longer lasting irredeemable gold
currency I do not feel compelled to revise the analysis of gold as a
measure of value developed by Marx in <strong>Capital</strong>,
where he wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;although the money that
performs the functions of a measure of value is only ideal money, price
depends entirely upon the actual substance that is
money.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f22" href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Marx poked fun on the representatives of
the &#8220;absurd hypothesis that commodities are without a price,
and money without a value, when they first enter into circulation, and
that, once in the circulation, an aliquot part of the medley of
commodities is exchanged for an aliquot part of the heap of precious
metals.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f23" href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a> Hilferding repeats that opinion,
but is it not suitable to his theory about the socially necessary
circulation value? Also in his theory money enters into circulation
without a value. To be sure he lets commodities enter into circulation
with a value, but he is only able to do that by calling their value
price.</p>

<p>Finally Hilferding himself becomes uneasy about his theory and
therefore remarks:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;A pure paper currency of this
kind cannot meet the demands imposed on a medium of circulation for any
extended period of time. Since its value is determined by the value of
the circulating commodities, constantly subject to fluctuations, the
value of money would also fluctuate constantly. Money would not be a
measure of the value of commodities; on the contrary, its own value
would be measured by the current requirements of circulation, that is
to say, by the value of commodities, assuming a constant velocity of
circulation. A pure paper currency is, therefore, impossible as a
permanent institution, because it would subject circulation to constant
disturbances.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f24" href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In other words: the socially necessary
circulation value, when closely looked at, is nothing but a socially
harmful, constant disturbance to circulation. Let us thus rather remain
with Marx&#8217;s &#8220;detour.&#8221;<br />

&nbsp;</p>

<h4>3. The Value of Gold and the Central Banks</h4>

<p class="fst">In his article on money and
commodity&nbsp;<a id="f25" href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a>
Hilferding applies the law of socially necessary circulation value
advanced by him to gold currency, after having applied it in <strong>Finance
Capital</strong> only to irredeemable currency and to paper
currency. He claims that under the gold standard that law determines
the value of the sum of money employed for circulation purposes.</p>

<p>According to Hilferding, the sum of money employed for
circulation purposes is today regulated by central bank, which absorbs
all the gold for sale. &#8220;The demand is therefore
unlimited.&#8221; This gold disappears in the central
bank&#8217;s vaults and is distributed from there to the extent
required by the changing circulation value.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Let us suppose that the
circulation value grows from 1,000 to 1,500. If there were no gold
hoard, the exchange ratio of the gold coins would have to change. 1
mark would be now worth 1&frac12; marks and vice versa.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">But thanks to the gold hoard [of the
central bank] there will always be as much gold available as required
by the circulation value. The central bank will absorb superfluous gold
or add gold to circulation if it is lacking.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;A change in the
value ratio (between money and commodity) cannot therefore develop at
all, because for the changes in the value of gold to manifest
themselves, money must remain in circulation. Only when commodities and
means of circulation face each other directly can they determine each
other&#8217;s value. Money out of circulation&#8212;as hoard in
the central bank&#8217;s vaults&#8212;stands in no relationship
to the sum of commodities in circulation.</em></p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;<em>The actual sequence
is therefore this. The producer of gold receives 1 kilogram of gold
coins for 1 kilogram of gold. The new gold lies in the central
bank&#8217;s vaults. If circulation needs increase, gold flows from
the vaults into circulation. Thus the rate of exchange between gold
coins and commodities always remains as it was at the beginning of the
process.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In other words, the law of value is
abolished for gold as money. Though that might sound amazing at first
sight, Hilferding does not find it surprising.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The law of value requires
total economic freedom for its operation, but this freedom is modified
for the rate of exchange between money and commodities by the operation
of the central banks. The specific nature of money makes it difficult
to offer an illustrative example, but let us imagine the following
situation: in a completely closed, autarchic economy the state
introduces a monopoly of oil trade. Let us say that it keeps a reserve
of 100 million litres. It sells oil at a price of 30 marks every 100
litres to everyone, and is always ready to buy back the oil it sold at
a price of 29&frac12; marks. The result would naturally be a constant
oil price of 30 marks. This price would decide what other oil fields
would be exploited, which oil fields would yield rents and how high
those rents would be. A growing demand for oil would be met from the
reserve, and the &#8216;policy of the oil bank&#8217; would
always be to secure an adequate quantity. If the demand decreases or
production is especially abundant, the reserve also increases, which
would be considered an especially favourable circumstance by the bank
clerks. The sequence of events with gold is entirely analogous, only in
this case the constant rate of exchange [between money and commodities]
can also be theoretically accounted for more certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The central banks are today a sort of gold
monopoly. Formerly gold had &#8220;no unlimited demand,&#8221;
today by contrast the central bank absorbs all the gold and besides at
a fixed price.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The decisive thing is the
fixation of the coins as a certain weight in gold, and the absorption
of all gold by the central bank at this fixed &#8216;gold
price.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Then again &#8220;the central bank is
committed, and it cannot be otherwise, to satisfy immediately the needs
of circulation as soon as they arise.&#8221; In this way a
&#8220;social regulation of circulation&#8221; was established
through the central banks, which did not exist as long as gold, coming
from private mines, was bought by private persons, who also accumulated
the gold hoards. Under those circumstances, the value of money was
indeed determined by its production costs. Today it is determined by
the ratio between the amount of money in circulation and the socially
necessary circulation value, and since that ratio is always kept at the
same level by the central bank, we have a constant gold value. The
production conditions of gold may change as much as they want, but the
value of gold remains always the same.</p>

<p>Hilferding triumphantly reaches this conclusion:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;This is then the effect of
the &#8216;unlimited demand&#8217; for gold. It brings about
the stabilization of the rate of exchange of the gold coins and with
them of the gold ingots, as long as the conversion of gold into coins
is legally guaranteed. But in that way we also have since the general
introduction of the modern gold standard system an actually fixed
measure of value, which the economists looked for so long but which
they still did not recognize, because they already had it for a long
time.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">I regret having to stay even today, after
this clarification, among the ranks of those economists.</p>

<p>First of all the example of the state monopoly of oil trade
must be disposed of. If a state attempts, according to
Hilferding&#8217;s example, to introduce a monopoly of the oil
trade, the result would be not a constant oil price, but the bankruptcy
of the state, no matter whether it is a closed commercial state or not.
Let us suppose, in analogy with the contemporary development of gold
production, which we are trying to explain, that the conditions of
production of gold change, partly as a result of the finding of new,
richer fields, partly through technological improvements in its
extraction. A vast mass of oil becomes available, but consumption does
not change. The retail price remains the same and does not change as
[the constant] consumption would require it. The state does not sell
more oil than it formerly did, but it is pledged to buy at the old
price all the newly offered oil. Hilferding thinks that this would
increase the reserve. He also believes that the bank clerks would
consider that &#8220;an especially favourable
circumstance,&#8221; though he does not explain why. It is clear
that the state will finally run short of money to buy new oil, if it
constantly buys more than it sells. The monopoly of the oil trade can
be introduced, with constant prices, only when the state itself owns
all the oils fields and production can be maintained always at a
certain level. But if the monopoly remains a purely commercial
monopoly, as the analogy with gold production requires, the state must
have the possibility of reducing the price when production, and with it
supply, exceeds a certain level. Hilferding says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The conditions with gold are
completely analogous, only in this case the constant rate of exchange
can also be theoretically accounted for with greater
certainty.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Now, with the &#8220;completely
analogous conditions&#8221; of the oil monopoly one can demonstrate
with &#8220;greater certainty&#8221; the impossibility of a
&#8220;constant rate of exchange&#8221; [between money and
commodities].</p>

<p>Hilferding would perhaps object that his remarks must be taken
with a pinch of salt. The analogy between gold and oil would apply if
there were an unlimited supply of oil. Then its price could always be
kept at the same level, whatever the production conditions. But now the
central banks have developed an unlimited demand for gold.</p>

<p>What does that unlimited demand for gold consist of? One must
not understand by it, for instance, that everybody needs gold and
nobody has too much of it. That is an old story, even if it remains
always new. According to Hilferding the unlimited demand exists since
&#8220;the creation of the central banks that absorb unlimitedly
all the gold brought to the market.&#8221; How does that happen?</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;That means nothing more than
that 1 kilogram of gold coins is always given for 1 kilogram of gold.
That new kilogram at first disappears in the central bank&#8217;s
vaults, where it is guarded as a hoard.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">If Hilferding handed over a ten-mark note
and received a gold crone, he should not think that he received
&#8220;new gold&#8221; that he can deposit as
&#8220;hoard.&#8221; His &#8220;treasure&#8221; [<em>Schatz</em>
means both &#8220;hoard&#8221; and
&#8220;treasure&#8221;] remains exactly as it was before, only
its form has changed.</p>

<p>The same happens with the central bank when it absorbs gold.
It gives for 1 kilogram of gold ingots 1 kilogram of gold coins and
owns after this transaction not a single penny more gold than it did
before. It can let the gold ingots be minted again, and then exchange
once again the coins for ingots, and then repeat this process
indefinitely. But since when is that an &#8220;unlimited demand for
gold&#8221;? That &#8220;demand&#8221; is nothing but the
unlimited willingness of the central bank to exchange all the gold that
comes to it against another money form. Nobody will want to argue that
the money changers generate an &#8220;unlimited demand&#8221;
for the money that they exchange.</p>

<p>However, not all the gold has to be exchanged against coins.
The gold can actually increase the central bank&#8217;s hoard and
disappear in its vaults, if it is not exchanged against coins but
against paper money, i.e. against a money order. In that case a new
amount of gold is added to the one already existing [in the central
bank&#8217;s vaults]. Through this process all the gold that comes
into the market can be absorbed. Does perhaps the unlimited demand for
gold consist in that?</p>

<p>New gold comes into the central bank&#8217;s vaults, but
it does not belong to the central bank. It actually belongs to those
who own the money orders [<em>Anweisungen</em>: also
payment orders]. When they present the money orders, they must be
redeemed. That gold was therefore not acquired by the central bank; it
is a deposit of the owner of the money order, of the central bank note.
Here the &#8220;unlimited demand for gold&#8221; reveals itself
as the willingness of the central bank to store every amount of gold
coming into the market. The gold hoard of the central bank is nothing
but the union of the gold hoards of the money owners in the country,
which was previously split into countless cash boxes and cellars and is
now centralized. This centralization has its advantages, but is only
achievable when the central bank accepts every gold hoard that it is
asked to take in.</p>

<p>That is the whole secret of the &#8220;unlimited demand
for gold&#8221; that the central banks allegedly generate. It
changes nothing in essence, but just a little in the mechanism of
hoarding, which already functioned under developed commodity production
before the establishment of those banks. And the same is true of the
&#8220;social regulation of circulation&#8221; which the
central banks supposedly introduce instead of the former anarchy of
circulation. Hilferding says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The introduction (of money)
into circulation was (previously) not as mechanic a process as it is
today. Gold had then no unlimited demand. It had to be exchanged for
commodities, and so entered directly into circulation and there
remained, as long as private hoardings did not develop. Hoarding,
however, was not dependent on the circulation of commodities, but on
the private fortunes of individual economic actors.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Why previously gold had to be exchanged by
the gold producers immediately after its production is not clearly
evident. On the other hand, the gold producer has even today every
reason for exchanging his gold directly against commodities. Hilferding
believes that the central bank absorbs the gold and only releases it
when the needs of circulation require it. But, as we have seen, the
gold that the central bank exchanges for coins is not a new hoard. And
the gold producer wants the coins in order to put them into
circulation, for instance in order to buy means of personal consumption
or means of production. He employs his money in the same way, when he
exchanges his gold against bank notes or other paper payment orders. If
he is a capitalist, he does not let his gold lay idle, but buys, for
instance, shares from whose proceeds rails and locomotives are bought
for Chinese railways. In any case he seeks to put his money into
circulation. The establishment of the central bank makes no difference
at all. Whether the newly produced gold remains in circulation or is
temporarily hoarded never depends on the central bank&#8217;s will
but on the needs and wealth of the private money owners&#8212;today
as in the past.</p>

<p>And the same is true of the &#8220;regulation of
circulation&#8221; by the inflow of gold [into the central bank].
Hilferding says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The central bank&#8217;s
hoard serves directly as reserve for circulation, because the bank is
bound (and it cannot be otherwise) to satisfy the circulation needs as
soon as they arise. The situation was completely different when that
regulation did not exist. If from the circulation needs resulted that
the gold exchanged for commodities grew in value, there was no reason
for private persons to throw money into circulation.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">How do people throw money into circulation?
In no other way than by buying commodities (I am abstracting here, as
elsewhere in this work, from the function of money as a means of
payment, in order to avoid unnecessarily complicating the analysis).
Circulation is always commodity circulation, the buying and selling of
commodities.</p>

<p>The buying of commodities by particular persons depends on
their needs as consumers and producers. The central bank does not
change them in the least. It does not increase the amount of needs.
Admittedly, the buying of commodities does not depend on necessities
only, but also on the amount of money that we dispose of, as we all
sometimes painfully feel. If the amount of money available as hoard is
not enough for the purchases required by the household or the business,
then one must draw on credit, and try to borrow money from others who
have accumulated hoards. Circulation is created by those money
expenditures by particular persons.</p>

<p>What does the appearance of the central bank change? Does it
give money to people so that they can buy commodities? Unfortunately
that kind of social regulation of circulation does not exist. It is
always particular persons who create the circulation through their
purchases, either with their own or with borrowed money. The change
consists simply in the fact that part of their money lies as deposits
in the central bank, which must first release it, and further in the
fact that the central bank becomes their first credit provider. Only in
that way, through money advances and credits to particular physical or
juridical persons, does the central bank throw money into circulation.
Actually it almost does not intervene directly into
circulation&#8212;except in as much as the central bank buys
commodities itself. It is the private persons that throw into
circulation the money borrowed from it, according to their needs and
their means.</p>

<p>The modern method of putting money into circulation differs
only in form from the method used before the advent of central banking,
but not in essence. As previously we have no social regulation of
commodity circulation, and therefore also no regulation of the
circulation of money, which is determined by commodity circulation.
Like before commodity circulation is effectuated by the needs and means
of private persons. The central bank can, thanks to its huge machinery
and greater insight into the circumstances of private persons, overcome
more easily many circulation stoppages and grant credit more suitably
and quickly than many isolated money capitalists could possibly do. But
the circulation process of commodities is only a part of the entire
production process; it is therefore determined by the needs and results
of the production process, and as long as private property in the means
of production holds good for the process as a whole, a social
regulation of part of it is out of the question, even in a metaphorical
sense. Of course Hilferding did not mean to use his proposition about
social regulation in a literal sense.</p>

<p>But no matter what may be understood by social regulation, the
establishment of the central banks by no means changed the essence of
the circulation of commodities and money, as Hilferding believes.</p>

<p>The unlimited capacity of society to absorb gold&#8212;and
therefore the unlimited demand for the latter&#8212;is not a
discovery of the central banks; it has existed ever since there was
commodity production, because gold became the commodity regarded as
social material expression of wealth and gained the form of direct
general convertibility. That is why it became money. A commodity that
people will not receive gladly at any time and in any quantity cannot
become money. And the hoarding of gold is just as little a discovery of
the central banks. Reading Hilferding&#8217;s comments, one might
get the impression that money hoards were first regularly accumulated
in the central banks, and that, before them, accumulation was a matter
of chance, left to the arbitrary will of particular persons, which
might just as well not have happened. An actually uninterrupted,
regular commodity production is almost impossible without the
accumulation of sums of money at different times and places, from which
the owners again throw money into circulation according to their needs.
The lack of such money pools would not, as Hilferding argues,
&#8220;change the exchange ratio of the gold coins&#8221; owing
to the law of circulation value; it would rather make the continuation
of commodity circulation and commodity production impossible.</p>

<p>Hilferding writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The central bank absorbs
every superfluous gold piece in circulation and adds it to its hoard; a
change in the value ratio [between money and commodities] cannot
therefore take place at all.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The situation is different when no gold
hoard exists [in the central bank]:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Let us suppose that the
circulation value grows from 1,000 to 1,500. If no gold hoard were
available, the rate of exchange of gold coins would change. One mark
would be now worth 1&frac12;, and vice versa.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In other words: if the circulation value
drops from 1,000 to 1,500, each mark will be worth 50 pfennigs if there
is no central bank to absorb the superfluous gold coins. That is the
real meaning of &#8220;vice versa.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a situation is naturally completely unimaginable, because
if coins of twenty marks containing <sup><small>20</small></sup>/<small><small>1395</small></small>
pounds of gold were worth only <sup><small>10</small></sup>/<small><small>1395</small></small>
pounds of gold, everybody would transform them into full-valued gold by
melting the undervalued coins. But generally speaking, did not a
situation ever arise where more gold money circulated than was required
by the needs of circulation? Was then anyone forced by the lack of a
central bank to give away his money? What he did not need for the
purchase of commodities, and therefore for commodity circulation, he
kept in his pocket if there was no central bank in whose vaults he
could deposit it.</p>

<p>Hilferding&#8217;s formula for the circulation value, as
we have already seen, was built upon the model of the law that Marx
advanced for determining the amount of money in circulation, which
reads:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The quantity of money
functioning as the circulating medium is equal to the sum of the prices
of the commodities divided by the number of moves made by coins of the
same denomination.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f26" href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">&#8220;This law holds
generally&#8221; says Marx. It is not some sort of ideal that was
first realized by the central banks. For Hilferding however the law
only applies since the establishment of the central banks, and under
those conditions no changes can take place in the value of gold.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Because for changes in the
value of gold to take place, <em>gold would have to remain in
circulation</em>. Only when commodities and means of circulation
confront each other directly can they <em>mutually determine
their value.</em>&#8220;</p>

<p class="fst">What is this again but the
&#8220;absurd hypothesis that commodities are without a price, and
money without a value, when they first enter into circulation, and
that, once in the circulation, an aliquot part of the medley of
commodities is exchanged for an aliquot part of the heap of precious
metals&#8221;?&nbsp;<a id="f27" href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> The only difference between the
vulgar quantitative theory [of money] and Hilferding&#8217;s
circulation value is that the former includes in the heap of precious
metals all the extracted gold (and accordingly silver) while Hilferding
understands by the heap of precious metals only the part of gold in
circulation, which in his view can always be kept by the central banks
in a certain ratio with the medley of commodities. Provided that the
heap of precious metals maintains always the same ratio <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em>
the medley of commodities, increasing and decreasing in the same way,
then the same aliquot part of the medley of commodities will always be
exchanged for the same aliquot part of the heap of precious metals.
That train of thought lies at the basis of Hilferding&#8217;s
statement:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If the circulation needs
increase, gold flows from the [central bank&#8217;s] vaults into
circulation. <em>Thus the rate of exchange between gold coins
and commodities always remains as it was at the beginning of the
process.</em>&#8220;</p>

<p class="fst">However Hilferding proves here more than he
wanted to prove. He wanted to show that under those circumstances the
value of gold remains the same. But the rate of exchange between gold
coins and commodities is not the value of gold, but the <em>price
of commodities</em>. If Hilferding were right, <em>then
commodity prices would remain unchanging</em>.</p>

<p>Here the basic error of his whole theory of circulation value
becomes evident. It leaves aside completely the fact that commodities
are furnished with prices, and that they have therefore measured their
value with gold before entering into circulation. In order for gold to
accomplish that function as a measure of value it just has to be <em>imagined</em>
[<em>visualized</em>], but it must previously have a
certain value. Whether the actual gold circulates or remains in the
central bank&#8217;s vaults or in the stocking of a
peasant&#8217;s wife, does not concern in the least its function as
a measure of value. Commodities come to the market provided with
prices, and therefore as representatives of a certain amount of gold.
How much gold is required to buy all the commodities depends on their
sum of prices as well as on the velocity with which the different
purchases and sales follow each other and the money changes hands. It
is not the amount of money in circulation that determines the
&#8220;rate of exchange between gold coins and
commodities,&#8221; that is to say the sum of prices of the
commodities, but on the contrary, it is the sum of prices of the
commodities that determines the amount of money in
circulation&#8212;a sum of prices, which presupposes the values of
the commodities as well as the value of gold.</p>

<p>Hilferding believes that if always as much gold is in
circulation as is required by the needs of circulation, the rate of
exchange between gold coins and commodities remains unchanging. But one
of the factors that determine the circulation needs is precisely the
rate of exchange between gold and commodities.</p>

<p>Just as little as Hilferding&#8217;s remarks in <strong>Finance
Capital</strong> does his article on money and commodities give
cause for revising the view developed by Marx in <strong>Capital</strong>,
according to which gold enters into circulation with its own value,
which is ultimately determined by the socially necessary labour time,
and commodities enter into circulation with certain prices, thereby
determining the amount of gold required to accomplish their sales. I do
not see the slightest reason for assuming that anything changes therein
when the central banks centralize the function of hoarding and control
the distribution of money from those hoards.</p>

<p>Hilferding&#8217;s theoretical comments, despite their
ingenuity, are wrong because at their origin value and price were not
sufficiently kept apart. But with purely logical deductions, just as
with mathematical calculations, an insignificant error at the beginning
suffices to falsify all further logical consequences and calculations
and to bring them increasingly into contradiction with the correct
result the further they are carried forward, no matter how correct and
faultless they may be in themselves. The brilliance of the thinker only
serves in this case to make the mistake more difficult to recognize.</p>

<p>Finally, the conclusion of Hilferding&#8217;s analysis, if
he were right, would be that the advent of the central banks resulted
in the immutability of commodity prices. But even if we understand
Hilferding&#8217;s &#8220;value ratio&#8221; [between money
and commodities] or &#8220;rate of exchange of gold&#8221; not
as commodity prices, but as gold value, we come no less into
contradiction with the facts. Because it is certain that the value of
bullion, gold no less than silver, has changed at different times in
the course of developed commodity production. Not only did a great
revolution in the conditions of production of the money market take
place in the seventeenth century. As recently as a few decades ago a
similar revolution took place in the production of silver, and its
natural consequence was a definite fall in the value of silver, even in
countries with a silver standard. And there were already then central
banks with great metal hoards that received in their vaults every
silver penny withdrawn from circulation.</p>

<p>Neither practical experiences nor theoretical considerations
give us any plausible ground for accepting Hilferding&#8217;s
theory about the determination of the value of money by the socially
necessary circulation value, and for assuming that the law of the
determination of value by socially necessary labour is abolished by the
appearance of the central banks precisely for &#8220;the commodity
whose bodily form is also the immediate social incarnation of human
labour in the abstract.&#8221;&nbsp;<a id="f28" href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a> On the
contrary, the fact that even such a sharp thinker and solid student of
our mode of production as Hilferding failed as soon as he departed from
that theory of value is a new proof of its correctness&#8212;for
gold as well as for any other commodity.</p>
