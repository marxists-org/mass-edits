The Bolshevist Invasion</h3>

<p class="fst">In the first period of independent Georgia,
its forces had been put to many hard tests. But its severest trial came
last spring, as the result of the Bolshevist invasion by the strong
Russian forces, simultaneously from the south, from the north, and from
the east.</p>

<p>This treacherous invasion occurred without any declaration of
war in the first half of February. The world first heard of it from the
Georgian side. The Social-Democratic Party and the Trade Unions, as
well as the Federal Socialist Party, announced positively, together
with the Georgian Government, that Georgia had been invaded by Russian
troops and was threatened to the utmost.</p>

<p>They expected an immediate and vigorous protest against the
proceedings of Moscow would be forthcoming from the International
Socialist Congress at Vienna.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the telegram arrived late and, in addition, the
Congress was suffering under the influence of the formidable crisis
into which continental Europe had been plunged by the senseless demands
made on Germany by the Entente. Thus the general interest was occupied
by Western rather than Eastern politics. Above all, the representations
which came from Moscow, and which decisively denied any invasion of
Georgia by the Russian Army, served to confuse the judgment.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to subject these representations to a
detailed examination, as they answer themselves by their contradictions
and inconsistencies.</p>

<p>In order to be able to deny the invasion of Russian troops, it
was first stated that some villages on the Georgian frontier had
revolted, embittered by the tyranny of the Georgians. Some Armenians
on the southern border had given the signal, and then the rebellion
spread to Signakh, which lies in the east of Georgia, towards
Azerbaijan. Simultaneously, Abkhasia had risen in the extreme
north-west, close to the Russian border.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the rebellions broke out
precisely in those places, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Abkhasia, where
large and constantly increasing masses of Russian troops had been
quartered since November.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of some Armenian border villages are supposed
to have insisted on advancing towards Tiflis. The Russian Government
stated it had endeavoured, out of love of peace and benevolence, to
help the threatened Georgian regime, and offered its mediation between
the Georgians and the Armenians. It could not help it if Georgia
contemptuously rejected this mediation.</p>

<p>But scarcely was Tiflis captured than the picture immediately
changed. The Armenians had discharged their debt, the Armenians could
go. No further mention was made in the Russian telegrams of Armenian
rebellions, but now it suddenly appears that Communists had captured
Tiflis and overthrown the Menshevists.</p>

<p><strong>Pravda</strong> (in Moscow) congratulates
the Georgian comrades, and says that &ldquo;Menshevist Georgia has
become the last refuge for the counter-revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No further references to the Armenian rebellions or to the
peace mediations. Can any reasonable man hold it to be possible that
Moscow would have offered its helpful mediation to a Menshevist
Government which was threatened by Communists?</p>

<p>The later Russian telegrams about events in Georgia brand the
first news as lies. They more closely approach the truth, but do not
quite touch it. They admit that Tiflis was captured by Communists, and
not by revolting Armenians. But they would have us believe that it was
Georgian workers and peasants who rose against their own Government and
captured Tiflis.</p>

<p>One Moscow telegram stated: &ldquo;The Georgian
Revolutionary Committee announce the seizing of Tiflis by the
revolutionary Georgian workers and peasants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the same Georgian Communists, who up to January could
only secure an insignificant representation in any workers&rsquo;
or &ldquo;peasant&rdquo; organisation of Georgia, under
conditions of the fullest liberty of legal activity, had suddenly
gained sufficient strength in February to overthrow the Georgian
Government.</p>

<p>This is sufficiently remarkable, but more remarkable is the
following.</p>

<p>A rebellion of revolutionary workers usually first breaks out
in an industrial centre, and thence spreads over the remainder of the
country. The Communist revolt of the &ldquo;revolutionary workers
of Georgia&rdquo; did not break out in Tiflis, which comprises half
of the industrial workers of Georgia, but, as the Russian report itself
establishes, in remote villages, inhabited by a backward agrarian
population.</p>

<p>In such villages there were, indeed, numerous Communists, well
armed, and led by those who cherished implacable hatred of any
Menshevist organisation. They were the Russian Armies, and only they
were in a position to lend the Georgian Revolutionary
&ldquo;Committee&rdquo; the strength to advance successfully
against Tiflis, and to seize the town.</p>

<p>If, in spite of all, the Russian Government still attempts to
create the belief that its three strong armies on the southern,
eastern, and north-western boundaries of Georgia refrained from any
share in the fight between the Communists and Menshevist Georgia, this
is obviously because invasion by the Russian Armies would represent the
most impudent and shameless mockery of the principles most sacred to
every Socialist, which principles even the most hardened Bolshevists
still had doubts about throwing on the scrap-heap.</p>

<p>Yet stronger than such doubts is the hatred which the Moscow
Dictators cherish against everything which is called Menshevist or
Social-Democratic. They consider this is to be synonymous with
counter-revolution, but in reality they hate it far more than the
actual counter-revolution.</p>

<p>They enter into negotiations with capitalist England and
America, but they have sworn mortal enmity to every proletarian
organisation which accepts the principle that the emancipation of the
working class must be the task of the workers themselves, and that it
cannot be introduced by the involuntary submission of the workers to
the commands of Moscow.</p>

<p>The men of the Moscow International endeavour, with the aid of
every kind of lie and every species of corruption, to split all
Menshevist and Social-Democratic organisations. And shall they tolerate
right on their borders the Social-Democratic Republic of Georgia, this
&ldquo;last refuge&rdquo; of Menshevism, as <strong>Pravda</strong>
said, within the Russian sphere of power?</p>

<p>Georgia was Menshevist. Therefore, its death sentence was
pronounced in Moscow.</p>
