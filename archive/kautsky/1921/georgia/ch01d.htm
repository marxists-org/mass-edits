Industry</h3>

<p class="fst">We are able to make our sketch of industry
shorter than our sketch of agriculture. Not because this sphere is less
important, but because no great industry of any consequence exists in
Georgia. Very few capitalist undertakings are to be found there, and
handicraft on the smallest scale and homework &ndash; carpet and
cloth weaving &ndash; both in the textile and in the metal
industries &ndash; are predominant. There are numerous
handicraftsmen, who are extremely clever and tasteful, and nearly all
of whom work only for themselves.</p>

<p>The country produces an abundance of wool and silk cocoons. It
also produces some cotton, which grows in large quantities in the
neighbouring Aserbaijan and especially in Turkestan. But there exists
no large undertaking to work up this raw material. The jealousy of
industrial Great Russia did not allow competition of this nature to
arise. In the capital of Tiflis women can be seen at any moment walking
and carrying in their hands the hand-spindle with which they spin wool.
So far as they are concerned, not merely the spinning machine, but even
the spinning wheel has not yet been discovered.</p>

<p>The largest industry in the country is the railway works. The
railway from the Black Sea to Baku is the artery of the country. In
addition, account must be taken of the arsenal and some electrical
power stations. The rest of the large undertakings are almost all
subsidiary to agriculture, such as cognac distilleries, oil mills,
tanneries, and sawing mills. There are also tobacco factories, tile
works, and soap works.</p>

<p>Outside of the special industries there are some large mining
undertakings. It is a remarkable fact that only the least significant
of the coal deposits are worked, namely, those in Tkvibuli, which are
connected with the railway. The far better coal of Tvartscheli has not
yet been won. Its deposits are quite near the Black Sea, in fact, only
forty-five miles distant. It is necessary, however, to construct a
railway to this spot, and to make the harbour of Ochemtchiry accessible
to large ships. This has not yet been done, and thus a source of great
riches for Georgia has remained untapped.</p>

<p>This neglect is explained by the nearness of Baku with its
immense petroleum wealth. In a double connection Baku is of economic
importance for Georgia.</p>

<p>A system of pipe lines connects the petroleum wells of Baku
with Batoum, where a petroleum refinery has been established and
numerous ships are collected to pick up the petroleum. Batoum has
experienced from this cause a prosperity which is almost American.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the railways and industries of Georgia have
discovered in masuth, a by-product of petroleum, a fuel which for
cheapness, effectiveness and convenience, is not to be equalled. Coal
did not come into vogue.</p>

<p>Since the Revolution this has been altered. The military
operations involved in the struggle of the Bolshevists with the Entente
have not only, as we have seen already, prevented the import of corn
and the export of wine; they have also led to Baku being captured by
the Bolshevists who practically stopped the export of petroleum to
Georgia. Without petroleum and masuth, thrown back on bad coal, without
light and good fuel, the condition of the population of Georgia became
desperate. Railway facilities had to be restricted, and travelling was
slow and difficult, owing to the new fuel.</p>

<p>These events also did harm to trade, which was always active
so long as petroleum was available. Now the industrial products of
which Georgia had need were lacking. The disturbances to trade brought
about by the war, which persisted so long afterwards, were not overcome
by the attractive force which petroleum could have exerted.</p>

<p>The commodity most in demand for export was still manganese,
which was not dependent on the Russian market. Of the million tons of
ore which Georgia exported in 1913, merely one per cent went to
Russia; on the other hand, 38 per cent went to Germany, 22 per cent
to England, and 17 per cent to Belgium. From the outbreak of war up to
the present time the export of this commodity has suffered considerably
from transport difficulties.</p>

<p>These difficulties, which were not created by the democratic
regime, formed, together with the backwardness of agriculture, the
chief cause of the blight which rested after the revolution upon the
Georgian paradise.</p>
