<h1>Georgia</h1>

<hr class="section" />
<h3>Preface to the English Edition</h3>

<p class="fst">THE present book is the result of a visit
which I made to Georgia in August 1920. Invited by the
Social-Democratic Party of Georgia, I journeyed thence at the same time
as the delegation of the Second International, which had been, asked to
visit the country by the Georgian Government. Falling ill in Rome, I
was only able to reach the country fourteen days after the delegation
arrived, in fact, just at the time when the latter was returning. I
remained a much longer time in the country, from the end of September
until the beginning of January. In view of the state of my health and
the unfavourable weather, I was prevented from visiting every part of
the country like the delegation. To this must be added my ignorance of
the Georgian language. Nevertheless, I was able to enter into direct
contact with the people and to acquaint myself with their ideas.
Likewise, the native literature relating to the country, both official
and private was inaccessible to me because of the language
difficulties, so far as I was not aided by translators.</p>

<p>Thus I cannot pose as one who has investigated the country.
Nevertheless, I have learned far more of it than an ordinary tourist;
everybody most readily gave me information upon all things that I asked
about; both the heads of the Government and officials as well as the
representatives of the Opposition; proletarians as well as business
people and intellectuals.</p>

<p>The Communists kept far away from me. What they had to say
could be seen each day in the daily papers which they published in
Tiflis, although in Russia no Social-Democratic paper is allowed to
appear.</p>

<p>Naturally, this did not prevent the Communists from
complaining about the lack of freedom in Georgia at every opportunity.</p>

<p>The freedom of the Press in democratic countries renders it
easy for abuses to be brought to light, provided equal freedom is
accorded to all sections.</p>

<p>Access to all institutions and undertakings was readily
granted to me. As I made it a principle not to announce my visit
beforehand, I could he certain that I should not be shown Potemkinian
villages.</p>

<p>Thus, in spite of all difficulties, I have collected a large
amount of information, and believe I have obtained a correct picture of
the characteristics of the country, at least in broad outline.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to write a book of travel &ndash;
my personal experiences were too slight for this purpose &ndash;
nor do I propose to give a detailed account of the country and the
people. I must leave this to observers who are able to remain a longer
period in the country and to see more of it than I did, and who are
familiar with the language of the country.</p>

<p>What occupied my attention in Georgia, and what I
shall deal with in this book, is not a geographical nor an
ethnological, but a social problem, the question whether a real
Socialist Government is possible in a country which is economically
more backward than its Russian neighbour; how such a Government was
able to maintain itself there, without dictatorship or terrorism, using
the means and methods of democracy, and what it was able, under these
circumstances, to achieve.</p>

<p>Thus I went to Georgia to study an interesting and important
social experiment, and to draw from it conclusions which would be
generally valid for Socialist practice. What I studied was the
antithesis to Bolshevism. However insignificant it appears, it deserves
our attention not less than the Bolshevist experiment, with its many
sensational reverberations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it has become impossible to follow the
practical development of the two experiments side by side to its
culminating point. The process of consolidation of the Georgian
community was brutally interrupted by the Russian neighbour and
competitor.</p>

<p>When, in January of this year, I set out upon my return
journey to Europe, I heard that the representative of Soviet Russia
spoke to the Georgian Government in tones of warmest sympathy. To-day
the representatives of Georgia are in possession of proofs that already
in December, 1920, the Russian Government were making their military
preparation for the invasion of Georgia, which followed in February.
Then the country again became a province of Russia, in the form of an
independent Soviet Republic. The small country was hedged in by a
Russian Red Army, which numbered 120,000 men, and plundered to the
utmost extent. As a subjugated territory, Georgia suffered more
severely from the domination of Bolshevism than unhappy Russia itself.
The course of its complete ruination, up to the point of absolute
starvation, which was completed within the Russian Empire in four
years, only occupied a few months.</p>

<p>I described, in the German edition of this work, conditions
which I had just seen, but which have been completely superseded by
other conditions at the time this English edition appears.
Nevertheless, the subject still retains vital interest. For we are
still confronted with Russian Bolshevism, the antithesis of the
Social-Democratic Republic of Georgia, a knowledge of which is so
helpful in enabling us to judge rightly the methods of Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>The dictatorship of the Moscow tyrants cannot become permanent
in Georgia, any more than in Russia itself. The Georgian people have
survived many barbarous invasions; they will also survive the
devastation of the Red Army and the horrors of the Extraordinary
Commissions. In Russia, and consequently in Georgia, too, democracy
must eventually triumph again.</p>

<p>Then the problems and experiences which I came up against in
Georgia and which are set forth in the present book will find added
significance beyond the confines of Georgia, for the whole of Russia
and its border States.</p>

<p>The immediate future will, no doubt, be terrible for the
country both north and south of the Caucasus. And even when every
dictatorship, White as well as Red, is replaced by democracy, the
economic organisms of those districts will, for a long time, bleed from
a thousand wounds, and exist in a state of painful convalescence.</p>

<p>Our tasks in Western Europe at the present time consist in
strengthening and unifying the Socialist parties and their
international organisation. The more we succeed in this, the sooner
shall we be in a position, not only to raise our own working class and
our own nations, but also to lend powerful aid to a speedy recovery in
the East.</p>

<p>Only for astronomers, but not for Socialists, is the saying
valid that light comes from the East. When we Socialists of the West
are called upon to bring redeeming light to the world, this does not
signify a compliment to us, but a task which imposes on us the most
devoted activity for our great ideal of the emancipation of the
oppressed.</p>
