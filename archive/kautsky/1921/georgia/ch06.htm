The Foreign Policy of the Republic</h3>

<p class="fst">We have seen that the Social-Democratic
Party of Georgia, unlike that of Poland, functioned not as an
independent party, but as a part of the Social-Democracy of Russia, as
a citadel of Russian Menshevism. But it stood for the
self-determination of the Georgian as of every other nationality. To
achieve this object, the Party did not consider it to be necessary to
separate from the Russian State. It would have been quite satisfied if
Georgia had become one of the States of an allied republic of the
United States of Russia. Not as Georgians, but as Menshevists, it took
part in the elections to the Constituent Assembly in November 1917. In
the interest of the whole of Russia, Tsereteli defended the rights of
the Assembly on its opening against the threatened coup
d&rsquo;&eacute;tat of the Bolshevists. He pointed out that the
dissolution of the Assembly spelt nothing loss than the ruin of
industry, eternal civil war, and the disruption of the Empire. His
arguments were answered by the Bolshevists by means of the force of
Lettish infantry and Cronstadt sailors. This has not prevented the
attitude of Tsereteli being right in the light of history.</p>

<p>The first consequence of the dissolution of the Constituent
Assembly was the disruption of the Empire. The centrifugal tendencies
obtained the upper hand in the eastern provinces, in the Ukraine, on
the Don, and in Kuban, in Siberia, and in the Caucasus.</p>

<p>The defection of Transcaucasia took place, not at once, but
gradually.</p>

<p>The Transcaucasian deputies, who had been elected to the
Constituent Assembly, were increased in number immediately after the
elections, by such unsuccessful candidates as had received the next
largest number of votes joining to form a Transcaucasian Parliament.
Previously, the revolutionary organisations of the district had
appointed an executive for its administration, namely, the
Transcaucasian Commissariat, which assumed the character of a local
government. Both these institutions quickly achieved independence of
Russia, not because they repudiated the central power, but because the
latter deserted the country and left it to itself. The retreating
masses of the Russian Army opened all roads to the pursuing Turks.</p>

<p>If Transcaucasia was not to be overwhelmed by the murderous
and destroying Turk, it was obliged to help itself. Its
&ldquo;Commissariat&rdquo; entered into negotiations with the
Turks and their German allies for an armistice and peace. It felt that
it had been sold and betrayed by the Bolshevist Government, and
therefore declined to participate in the peace negotiations of
Brest-Litovsk. It believed that it could better serve the interests of
the country if it pursued its own policy, independent of Russia, and in
this has been justified by the event.</p>

<p>After the capitulation of Russia at Brest-Litovsk, the
complete separation of Transcaucasia was a question of only a few
weeks. On April 22nd, 1918, the Transcaucasian Republic declared its
independence.</p>

<p>This new combination was to remain in existence only for five
weeks. Its constituent parts were too diverse.</p>

<p>Georgia represented the leading element but, from the
commencement, it had great difficulty in holding together the other
national members of the confederation, the Armenians who chiefly dwell
in Armenia, and the Tartars, who for the most part live in Azerbeijan.</p>

<p>The Armenians have no greater enemies than the Turks, and the
Kurds who are related to them, who are chiefly Mohammedans. On the
other hand, the people of Azerbeijan are mostly Mohammedans. They
incline towards the Turks, whereas the Armenians are disposed towards
any regime which shows itself ready to free them from the Turkish
danger, whether it be Czarism or the Entente. Now the Georgians
demanded complete neutrality, both towards the Turks and Russia, and
complete independence of both. For some time the Georgians were able to
recommend this policy to the two other great races of Transcaucasia.
But the Armenian-Tartar antagonism was too strong. It broke up the
Transcaucasian Republic in the exciting days which followed the Peace
of Brest-Litovsk.</p>

<p>When the Turks presented an ultimatum to Transcaucasia on May
26th, 1918, the Parliament dissolved and declared the Republic to be
ended. On the same day Georgia proclaimed its independence.</p>

<p>Its foreign policy remained the same as it was during the
Transcaucasian partnership. In the declaration of independence of May
26th, it is stated</p>

<p class="quoteb">The National Council declares</p>

<p class="quoteb">(1) Henceforth the people of Georgia
exercise sovereign rights over themselves.</p>

<p class="quoteb">(2) The political constitution of
independent Georgia is that of a democratic republic.</p>

<p class="quoteb">(3) Georgia will maintain an attitude of
constant neutrality in any international conflicts that might arise.</p>

<p class="fst">Hitherto Georgia has adhered steadfastly to
this policy, however difficult it has been, in view of the great
struggles which have been waged on its borders, and the constant
temptation on the part of one or the other of the great military powers
to win or compel the allied co-operation of the Republic.</p>

<p>The first difficulty arose immediately after the Declaration
of Independence. The Turkish ultimatum placed Georgia in a desperate
position. By itself it was impotent to resist the Turkish invasion. To
protect itself from this invasion, it was obliged to choose the lesser
of two evils. It opened the door to the German occupation, under the
agreement reached in Poti, on the 28th May, between von Lossow and
Tchenkeli. [<strong>Memoires on the relation between the
Transcaucasian and Georgian Republic and Turkey and Germany</strong>,
p.21]</p>

<p>The German troops came to Tiflis as protectors from the Turks,
and were, therefore, cordially welcomed.</p>

<p>The country was important to the Germans, as a highway to the
petroleum wealth of Baku, and to Persia. They came to Georgia not as
plunderers but as organisers of its productive forces, as they needed
the Georgian products, especially manganese, and also its railways.
Thus they brought to Georgia precisely what was most lacking in the
country, and what it could only obtain speedily by foreign assistance,
namely economic organisation.</p>

<p>The Germans have been popular in Georgia for a long time,
thanks to the Wurtemberg colonists who settled there a hundred years
ago as peasants and retained their nationality until to-day, earning
for themselves a good reputation. The German occupation was further
raised by the achievement of troops in occupation. Georgia is one of
the few countries in this war where the German Armies have done
propaganda work for Germany. Nevertheless, the Georgian Government
decisively rejected the overtures of the Germans to enter into an
alliance with them against Soviet Russia or the Entente.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Germans did not succeed in
persuading Georgia to form an alliance with the Central Powers. The
attempts of German diplomacy to involve Georgia in the Russian Civil
War were equally unsuccessful.</p>

<p class="quote">When in the autumn of 1918 a group of
Russian reactionaries attempted to form an &lsquo;Astrakhan
Army&rsquo; the German Command proposed to the Georgian Government
to permit the enrolment of volunteers for this army in its territory.</p>

<p class="quote">The Government of the Republic answered
with a categorical refusal. [Woytinsky. <strong>Una vera
democrazia</strong>]</p>

<p>The policy of Georgia underwent no change when after the
collapse of the German Army and its Allies, the Entente invaded
Transcaucasia. Now it was the Entente which sought to entangle Georgia
in the Russian Civil War, and to draw it into an alliance with Denikin
against the Bolshevists. These overtures too were definitely rejected
by the Georgian Government, which continued to maintain the strictest
neutrality. That was not easy, as the conflicting classes in Russia
adopted the attitude of who is not for us is against us.</p>

<p>The democratic country, which had expropriated the ground
landlords, was a thorn in the side of the Generals of the counter
revolution. The Republic seemed to be not less inconvenient to the men
of the Soviet Republic, if for other reasons. They hated Georgian
Menshevism right heartily.</p>

<p>Both the dictator&rsquo;s who aimed at restoring Czardom,
and the People&rsquo;s Commissaries could not bear to think that
within their orbit was a free and independent community, which would
not obey the dictates of Moscow. A great part of the fighting between
the Bolshevists and the white troops took place on the northern borders
of Georgia. Sometimes the one and sometimes the other side, whichever
happened to be victorious, attempted to subdue the free mountain
peoples of the Caucasus, and occasionally invaded Georgia, in order
either to set up the re-action, or to provoke a Communist rebellion
which would lead to submission to the Moscow regime.</p>

<p>At first it was the Bolshevists who, without any declaration
of war, invaded the coastline of Georgia, in the autumn of 1918 and
captured Sukhum. Georgian forces pressed them back. The Bolshevists
were soon followed by Denikin&rsquo;s forces, who seized the
territory which had been wrested from Georgia by the former Georgia
endeavoured to negotiate, but Denikin was not disposed to do so. He
advanced, but was at length thrown back, like the Bolshevists. The
intervention of the English succeeded in restoring peace.</p>

<p>In the following year the white troops tried to subdue the
mountain peoples in the northern Caucasus, who had won their
independence. Georgia remained neutral, but its sympathies lay with
those who had been attacked and were struggling for their freedom. It
protested repeatedly against the violence of the
counter-revolutionaries, and numerous Georgian volunteers fought in the
ranks of the Caucasians.</p>

<p>A rapproachment between the Soviet Republic and Georgia began
to take place at the commencement of 1920. The People&rsquo;s
Commissaries proposed to the Georgian Republic an alliance for common
action against the white volunteer army. This alliance was refused,
albeit the Georgian Government considered that any foreign intervention
in Russia and any participation of a foreign power in the Russian Civil
War to be wrong and disastrous.</p>

<p>The Government of the Georgian Republic remained true to this
attitude, and whenever an opportunity arose, opposition was offered to
foreign intervention.</p>

<p>Although an alliance for military purposes was refused, a
friendly approach to Russia was welcomed. Eventually a definite treaty
of peace was made with Soviet Russia (7th May 1920) whereby both powers
mutually recognised each other, and promised to live in peace and
harmony.</p>

<p>Georgia has faithfully observed this peace, but not so the
Soviet Republic. Scarcely had the latter concluded peace than its
troops invaded Georgia from the side of Azerbaijan, which Soviet Russia
had seized shortly before by a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat. Once
more the Georgians succeeded in throwing back the invading enemy, and
again offered peace as soon as the beaten foe was ready for it.
Scarcely had peaceful conditions been re-established than the
Bolshevists organised new military invasions from the north, in order
to provoke insurrections in northern Georgia. Almost at the same time
(July) a Communist conspiracy was discovered in Abkhasia, having
relations with the Russian Military Command, and implicating two
officials belonging to the Russian Mission in Tiflis.</p>

<p>But all these deceits and treacheries had attained no success
worthy of mention till February of 1921. This fact demonstrated the
firmness as well as the circumspection and energy of the Georgian
Government. It also showed the shamelessness of the Communists who were
never tired of waxing indignant over the terrorism in Georgia, because
a few Communist conspirators had sometimes been arrested and condemned
to imprisonment, or some Communist newspaper which spread false news
had been suspended for a few days.</p>

<p>In the few months prior to February of this year, a new storm
broke over the small, but undaunted Republic. At the end of September
1920 the Turkish Nationalists invaded Armenia.</p>

<p>Soon Russian troops from Azerbeijan proceeded to Armenia, in
order to seize the country and transform it into a vassal of Russia.
Both in Armenia and Azerbaijan Russian troops assembled in a
threatening guise, on the borders of Georgia. This fact compelled the
latter to mobilise also.</p>

<p>The language of the Russian Representative in Tiflis became
increasingly threatening. In the middle of December, a conspiracy was
discovered in Tiflis, the object of which was to provoke
street-fighting in that town, which would furnish a pretext for the
invasion of Georgia by the Russian troops watching on the border, 60
kilometres from Tiflis. Among the conspirators, officials of the
Russian Embassy were again discovered.</p>

<p>This would have justified the Georgian Government in giving
Herr Scheimann, the Russian ambassador in Tiflis, his passports, but it
contented itself with asking Lenin to recall Scheimann and replace him
by another person, because his activities disturbed the good relations
between the two States.</p>

<p>But Scheimann remained.</p>

<p>Thus at the beginning of January, the situation of the small
Republic had become very troubled.</p>

<p>The Bolshevist invasion which threatened in the spring if the
Moscow Dictators had not themselves been checked, has now come sooner
than was expected. The fate of Georgia only depended on the strength of
her arms.</p>
