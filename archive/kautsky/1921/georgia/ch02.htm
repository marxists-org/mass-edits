The Social Revolution</h3>

<p class="fst">The most important task of the new
government consisted of clearing away the remains of feudalism. The
abolition of serfdom and the creation of a free peasantry happened in
Georgia between 1864 and 1871, somewhat later than in Russia.</p>

<p>As in Russia this reform was carried out in such a way that
the peasant lost land. He only received, in the capacity of proprietor,
a small portion of the land to which he was attached as serf. The
largest and best part remained with the feudal lords, from whom the
peasant was obliged to lease the land, if he wanted to live. In this
way the system of small holdings arose, similar to what exists in
Ireland and South Italy, which makes any rational agriculture
impossible, and yields a scanty living to the countryman.</p>

<p>It was left for the revolution to take the land from the
feudal nobles, to provide the poor peasant with land, and to change
the leaseholder into a freeholder. This was no socialistic but a
middle-class revolution, but the conditions rendered it necessary, and
it took place. We Marxians are distinguished from utopian socialists
by the fact that we recognise that Socialism is only possible under
specific circumstances. What it is incumbent on us to do is always
suggested by the circumstances which arise.</p>

<p>The Agrarian Revolution was rendered necessary by a set of
circumstances similar to those existing in Russia.</p>

<p>It came to the same end under democracy as under dictatorship.
But under democracy the revolution was carried out more peacefully,
systematically and consciously, in a less chaotic and disturbing
manner, and less to the special advantage of favoured or reckless
sections of the peasantry.</p>

<p>The Agrarian Reform was introduced by a decree of the 16th
December 1917 of the first provisional government in Transcaucasia
(Georgia, Aserbaijan and Armenia) which was formed after its
separation from Russia. The Social-Democratic Party of the
Transcaucasian Parliament, which met in February, 1918, introduced an
Agrarian law which was passed on the 7th March. This was valid for the
whole of Transcaucasia. But it was only carried out in Georgia, which
soon separated from Aserbaijan and Armenia. The law expropriated every
large landowner. No compensation was paid to him, but he was allowed to
retain as much land as he could till, with his family, that is a
medium-sized peasant holding. The maximum extent of land which a single
family could own might not exceed seven dessjatinen (one dessjatin
equals two and a half acres) of gardens or vineyards, fifteen
dessjatinen of arable land, or forty dessjatinen of pasture land. All
estates which exceeded these dimensions are taken into the possession
of the State, and form a land reserve.</p>

<p>Well conducted, intensive large-scale cultivation is
maintained as far as possible, and is either carried on under the
auspices of the State, or devolved upon the local assemblies. The
remainder, consisting of gardens and arable land, is used to increase
the holdings of poor peasants.</p>

<p>The peasant, who was formerly a tenant, obtains possession of
the land which he cultivates. Pasture land is chiefly given up to
common usage.</p>

<p>The Act passed on the 7th March, 1918 prescribed that poor
peasants needing land could only lease portions of the land reserve
from the State. But a new Act, passed on the 29th January, 1919,
specified that they could purchase the State land at a moderate price.
This is certainly not a Socialistic step, but it was rendered
unavoidable by the pressure of the peasants. It was also expected that
the peasant, when he became the owner of his land, would more readily
make improvements and adopt a rational system of cultivation than when
he was a mere tenant. Bolshevism must likewise compound with this
settlement. Both Georgia and Russia are now in the same economic stage
as was France in the beginning of the Great Revolution. Peasant
proprietorship is not, however, completely free in Georgia. In every
sale of land, the State has the first right of purchase. In this manner
about two million dessjatinen of gardens, and arable land, pastures and
woods have been acquired, of which the cultivated land amounts to about
half a million dessjatinen. Pasture land is almost one million
dessjatinen. In addition, the woods and domains of the old Russian
State and of the Czarist families have reverted to the Georgian State,
which has thus become possessed of an enormous extent of land.
Including woods which formerly belonged to the Russian State or Czarist
families, the whole of the forests of Georgia comprises two million
dessiatinen), or one-third of the exploitable land of the country, and
this land remains in the hands of, and is managed by the Georgian State.</p>

<p>In addition, there are great model undertakings which are
either managed by the State or by the local councils, and numerous
mineral springs, some of which are equipped with adequate technical
apparatus. These also have passed into the possession of the State,
which has likewise sequestrated all water power. The latter will become
a source of immense wealth in the future. Its average mechanical power
is estimated at two million and a quarter horse power, of which only
three thousand four hundred are actually exploited. All harbour sites
belong to the State, and last, but not least, the revolution has made
the State the master of all mineral wealth.</p>

<p>Hitherto the State has not been able to secure the needful
staff and machinery to work the mines to advantage itself, but the
coalfields of Tkvibuli are directly exploited by the State. Other mines
are leased, such as the manganese deposits of Tschiaturi and the copper
mines of Allaverdi to a French company, and others in the district of
Batoum to a German company (Shuckert).</p>

<p>Nationalisation has not been undertaken so energetically and
consciously in the manufacturing industries, as in the mining and
agricultural branches. Their present stage of development is little
suited to State management. Only isolated undertakings among them have
been nationalised, not because of the principle, but for special
reasons.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, it may be said that all that can be
nationalised under existing conditions has been nationalised, and no
further progress can be made.</p>

<p>According to statistics of the Ministry of Labour, there were
73,486 workers engaged in large industrial undertakings in Georgia in
1920. Of these 38,743 (52.7 per cent) were occupied in State
undertakings; 20,592 (28 per cent) in municipal, co-operative and local
undertakings, and only 14,151 (19.3 per cent) in private undertakings.
This will show how insignificant private industry is in Georgia at the
present time.</p>

<p>In regard to commerce some export monopolies have been
introduced, such as manganese, tobacco, silk, and wool. These are
fiscal rather than Socialistic measures, and it remains to be seen how
they succeed. For export trade, a State bureaucracy is as unsuitable an
agent as is possible; the Georgian bureaucrats are very inexperienced,
and the traditions left behind by their predecessors, the Czarist
bureaucracy, are the worst possible. The world market is at present, as
difficult to survey as ever it was.</p>

<p>To enable Georgia to thrive, it is necessary to open up many
new branches in trade as well as in industry. In the state in which the
country finds itself, private capital cannot be dispensed with in the
establishment of such new branches.</p>

<p>In this economic reconstruction a great part may be played by
county councils, communes and co-operative societies, the
administrations of which are more flexible and capable of a greater
initiative than the lumbering, economic machinery of the State.</p>

<p>The revolution has brought complete self-government to the
counties and municipalities of Georgia. This self-government had to be
created <em>de novo</em> in place of the centralised,
bureaucratic tutelage from above. All experience was lacking, and
sometimes the necessary resources. In spite of this, the young
institutions have developed a vigorous life, and we have already seen
that some large agricultural undertakings have been transferred to the
municipalities. The provincial assemblies have also established their
own dispensaries, and mills, spinhouses and other undertakings for
working-up and completing the raw products of the province. In
addition, draining and irrigation works have been taken in hand by
them. Likewise, the regulation of the medical service. The twenty-one
assemblies are combined in a union, which holds congresses for the
exchange of experiences, and the collection of information. The Union
has appointed a committee of experts which overlook the individual
undertakings of the municipality, and tender advice.</p>

<p>These institutions are too new to allow a decisive judgment to
be passed on them, but a healthy life pulses though them, and the
course they have followed is already full of promise.</p>

<p>The above applies equally to the co-operative societies. They
are depreciated by many Socialists, owing to the fact that they are
represented by the advocates of harmony as a panacea to cure the evils
of Capitalism. This is nonsense. The great capitalist monopolies can be
dealt with only by the power of the State when it is directed by the
proletariat. In those spheres where the monopolistic character of
capital has scarcely made itself felt, the production carried on by
organisations of consumers can create socialistic conditions of
production, if these consumers' organisations are dominated by the
socialist outlook, and thus are in the hands of proletarians conscious
of their part in the class struggle.</p>

<p>In this sense the consumers&rsquo; co-operative societies
may become of special importance in countries where industry is as yet
undeveloped, but where a class-conscious proletariat already exists. In
such places the co-operative societies may take in the peasantry, which
has not yet become consciously antagonistic to the proletariat, as in
Western Europe, and make its purchasing power of service in building up
the co-operative industry which will arise in competition with the
capitalist industry, and tends to restrict and moderate the influence
of the latter ever workers and consumers.</p>

<p>In such a country as Russia the co-operative societies may
assume unsuspected importance for the proletarian class-struggle, and
the establishment of Socialism. This also holds good for Georgia. Its
co-operative organisations were first formed in the Czarist period, but
only since the revolution have they been able to develop freely, and
they have expanded rapidly.</p>

<p>Already in May 1916 the consumers&rsquo; societies of
Transcaucasia (Georgia, Aserbaijan, and Armenia), to the number of 126,
united to form a wholesale buying agency. 565 societies were attached
to this union in 1917, and in 1919, in Georgia alone, there were 989
societies, with about 300,000 members.</p>

<p>The Union of Co-operative Societies began to produce on its
own account in 1919. A silk factory is established, a sausage factory,
engineering works, which turn out agricultural implements; then
vegetable and fruit preserving factories, and finally a printing-press.</p>

<p>None of these undertakings works at a loss, and most of them
yield a surplus.</p>

<p>It is all to the good that the co-operative societies have
proceeded slowly and cautiously in laying the foundations of their
productive activities. The stormy movement, which corresponds to the
revolutionary temperament and is in place when hostile positions are to
be captured, is not advantageous in the founding of economic
organisations.</p>

<p>In this case it is necessary to make careful preparation to be
sure of the ground before advancing, and not to go farther than is
allowed by the available resources. In economics it is not the same as
in war, where a vigorous offensive often obtains the best result, but
not in every case. The Bolshevist outlook, which envisages the
socialistic reorganisation of the processes of production as a problem
in military tactics, is generally doomed to failure. In the economic
domain over-hasty procedure always leads to disasters, which may
sometimes jeopardise the whole movement, and entails the buying of
experience very dearly.</p>

<p>The Georgian methods of socialisation are, with all their
energy, quite free from over-haste and the danger of reaction. Thanks
to the fact that they are based on democracy, they have kept clear of
that species of State and Barrack Socialism, which imagines that social
production can be introduced by rigid centralisation of the entire
productive forces, and their subjection to the dictatorship of a small
committee, excluding all self-government.</p>

<p>Our Georgian comrades know that many roads lead to Socialism
as well as to Rome. The problem of social production may be attacked
from many sides, and State control forms only one of those starting
points. Finally, socialistic production is impossible without the
fullest development of the capabilities of the workers, which can be
attained only by the complete liberty of political parties, trade
unions, co-operative societies, the municipalities, and provinces. The
stretching of all these institutions upon the Procrustean bed of an
all-oppressive and all-reaching centralised dictatorship means death to
that kind of Socialism which signifies the emancipation of the
proletariat. The latter Socialism is what we should aim at.</p>

<p>Democracy, and that alone, can provide for the complete
liberty and possibilities of development of the workers, individually
and as a class.</p>

<p>The Communists think that they are uttering deep wisdom when
they speak of &ldquo;formal democracy.&ldquo; They teach us
that the equality of citizens under democracy is but a formal equality,
as economic inequality is not thereby removed. That the mere casting of
a vote is an empty form, as the economic relations of power are not
thereby disturbed. We knew all this: quite well at a time when the
present Communists were still in their cradles, but it has not
prevented us from agitating for democracy. For it spells freedom of
investigation, of discussion, of propaganda; the freedom of public
meeting, and of organisation; the fullest participation in the
self-government of municipalities and provinces, in the legislation of
the State, and in the control and determination of the Government.</p>

<p>Only a fool can assert that all these liberties and
possibilities are of a merely formal nature, and make no difference to
the position, the capacities, and strength of the proletariat, and the
labouring masses.</p>

<p>In lucid moments the Communists themselves recognise the
importance of democracy and believe it will be of use to them, as they
say that the proletariat needs democracy &ndash; which in their
eyes is an instrument of capitalist domination &ndash; only so long
as the capitalist class rules. So soon, however, as the proletariat has
captured the power, democracy ceases, according to Communist doctrines,
to be a means for the development of proletarian strength and capacity.
Then it becomes a danger for the proletariat; henceforth the
proletariat must renounce all independence, and submit itself blindly
to the absolute domination of the Government which it has placed in
power. According to this conception, the proletariat needs democracy
only when it is in the fighting stage, but when it is successful it
requires an Absolutism, which is different from Czardom only by its
communist enlightenment. It may well be wondered how such a doctrine
could find disciples outside Russia. But it should not be forgotten
that the enlightened Absolutism of Russia in former times understood
how to arouse enthusiasm for its social institutions and actions among
naive spirits in Western Europe, and especially in France.</p>

<p>If a Diderot and a Voltaire could be inspired by Catherine the
Second, why should not the far less witty Cachin and Loriot perceive in
the dictatorship of the Moscow party leaders &ndash; over Europe
the way to the emancipation of the proletariat and the progress of
mankind.</p>
