The Difficulties of the Government</h3>

<p class="fst">However favoured Georgia may be by nature,
and however rational the democratic methods of its socialist
government, its situation was anything but brilliant.</p>

<p>We have already described the chief causes of its distress.
They consist in the dependence of the economic life of Georgia upon
foreign countries. Without the importation of corn, as well as of
industrial products, and a corresponding exportation of its own
products, such as manganese, copper, tobacco, wool, silk, and wine, the
country cannot exist. The old trade connections were destroyed by the
war, which still continues on the borders of Georgia, and renders
difficult any relations with other countries. This is doubly
unfortunate at a time when world commerce is impeded by various
measures arising out of the after-effects of the war and the general
lack of confidence, which would be merely ridiculous if they did not
involve the ruin of the people.</p>

<p>The Georgian Government is not in a position to change these
disastrous international conditions, and thus the people of Georgia,
like so many other peoples, must suffer from their effects.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the capital of Tiflis were hit the hardest.
Until the revolution Tiflis was the political centre of the whole of
the Caucasus, a territory with about ten million people. To-day it
forms the capital of little Georgia, with three million inhabitants.
This country by itself must sustain the 400,000 inhabitants of Tiflis.
This would not have been a simple matter in a state of uninterrupted
world trade, but the task assumes fearful proportions in the conditions
of restricted trade. Add to this that Tiflis, instead of losing its
inhabitants, revealed a large increase of population.</p>

<p>For with all its distress it was a paradise when compared with
its neighbours, Armenia, Aserbaijan, and Russia, where Bolshevism
reigns, not only with hunger and misery, but also with sullen silence
and everlasting fear, with the lack of all freedom of speech and of the
Press, with denunciations, arbitrary imprisonments and shootings, with
brutality and cruelty. Those who can flee from this hell &ndash;
the counter-revolutionaries to Europe; the workers from the towns to
the villages, many democratic and social-democratic intellectuals, and
qualified workers fled to Tiflis. Even Bolshevists sometimes sought a
refuge there, in order to recover from Communism. Through this
immigration the intellectual life of the town was variously stimulated.
Eminent men of learning, and artists from Russia met together here. But
the house famine was made ten times worse.</p>

<p>After high prices the housing shortage is the most generally
diffused after-effect of the war. It is to be found even in New York.
The war has used up so much capital, and so much of the productive
forces, that with what is left one is only able to live laboriously
from hand to mouth. There is neither capital nor resources for
undertakings which will repay the outlay on them only after many
years. Above all, not for buildings. All building activity is
paralysed. In addition, numerous dwelling-places situated on the
various theatres of war have been destroyed, and the inhabitants driven
into countries which were spared by the war. In those counties the
accommodation, not having been increased, suffices no longer.</p>

<p>Again, in those countries which did not take part in the war
the population has been increased by the normal processes, which still
more accentuates the housing difficulty.</p>

<p>Although the shortage is by no means confined to Tiflis,
together with the lack of food, it has been ascribed by the Communist
propaganda there to the Social-Democratic Government. This propaganda
is addressed to the simple folk who do not know that in Russia not
merely dearness, but the most desperate hunger prevails. The housing
shortage is certainly abating in many of its towns. In Petrograd
thousands of houses are empty, as of the population of that city
one-third has either starved, or frozen, or fallen victims to
pestilence or the Extraordinary Commission. Another third has fled to
the villages, and the remaining third still prolongs an anxious
existence in the town.</p>

<p>As is the case everywhere else in the world, the building of
new houses in Georgia is much impeded by the absence of long credits.
This is connected with the general lack of capital, but also with the
wretched state of the exchange.</p>

<p>This constituted the weakest point in the economic life of
social-democratic Georgia. The Georgian rouble was last year worth less
in gold than was formerly worth a kopeck, although its value remained
considerably higher than that of a rouble of the Russian Soviet
Republic.</p>

<p>As is the case with other countries, the principal cause of
the fall in the value of the Georgian rouble is to be looked for in the
inflation of the currency, and the excessive output of paper money. One
immediate result of the revolution was to reduce considerably the
revenue of the State. The old State constitution, being corrupt and
inimical to the people, had to be radically reformed, which was not a
simple matter in view of the lack of native experience. The new State
machinery did not always work well. It takes time to accustom the
emancipated peasant to pay taxes, and the revenue from duties was very
slight in consequence of the paralysis of trade. The State possessions
alone will suffice to cover the national expenses, when once they are
properly exploited, and all taxation would be rendered unnecessary. The
Budget of 1919-1920 estimated the income of the State at 749 millions
of roubles, of which 576 millions, or 76 per cent, would represent
revenue from, the national properties. But the war has thrown the State
undertakings into a condition of confusion, and lowered the revenue
from them. The large estates, which were taken over from the old
regime, yield a surplus, it is true, but this is not very large. Before
the war the railway was one of the few Russian Static lines which
earned a net profit. On account of the lack of masuth, and the great
exhaustion of material by the war, and lately by reason of the
cessation of trade, the services had been so restricted that they
barely covered the running costs of the undertaking. Repairs can only
be effected out of State resources, and many repairs are necessary.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the exploitation of the national
properties of Georgia, such as the forests and mines, has not yet been
undertaken. Before they can be set working large outlays are needed for
roads and railways.</p>

<p>Thus a great portion of the State possessions yield no
immediate revenue, but entail expenditure.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, other branches of State expenditure have grown
enormously. It is not merely a question of repairing the immense damage
wrought by the war, but special demands are made on the Government
because of its socialistic character.</p>

<p>A Socialist Government is not only expected to prepare the way
for the development of socialistic production, which, measured by our
impatience, is a protracted task. It must also put an immediate end to
all the poverty which it finds in existence. If the kind of poverty
which Capitalism creates is to be found in Georgia in no small degree,
all the more abundant is the poverty which has been accumulated by the
cheek to capitalist development &ndash; poverty which has arisen
from Feudalism, Absolutism and War.</p>

<p>To make an immediate end of this poverty, with the scanty and
impoverished resources of the State, is a task which no government
could achieve unless it were possessed of magical powers. And our
comrades, who have been placed in power by the revolution were not
only no wizards, but Menshevists, who neither believe themselves nor
seek to persuade the outside world that a dictatorship endows them
with magical powers.</p>

<p>However much the Government might strive to keep the tasks
which it set itself within the bounds of economic possibilities, the
everlasting demands which were pressed upon it surpassed so much the
extent of the available income of the State that the printing press was
the only resource which was left. Consequently, there was a constant
fall in the value of the rouble, and a continual increase in prices.</p>

<p>The evil was still more accentuated by the adverse trade
balance. Trade with Russia, which formerly constituted the chief part
of the export of tobacco, wine, mineral waters, etc., has been
destroyed to a large extent. This rendered maritime trade with Europe,
via the Black Sea, all the more important, but this trade had been
restricted for a long time owing to the lack of shipping space. Georgia
imported from Europe highly valuable industrial products, which
occupied little space. In exchange it had to offer only raw material,
which, in relation to its value, occupied much shipping space. No
wonder the value of imports exceeded the value of exports. In the year
1919 Georgia imported from Western Europe, Turkey, and America, goods
to the value of 397 millions of roubles and exported goods to the value
of only 9,3 millions. In the year 1920 the trade balance considerably
improved. On the other hand, the inflation still continued.</p>

<p>All this tended to depress the exchange to the lowest point.
Still worse than the falling of the rate of exchange, and the dearness
which it caused, was the constant fluctuations in the exchange, which
occur in all countries with a system of paper money. This makes all
business uncommonly difficult. Under these circumstances, long period
credits are not to be looked for, and short credits are available only
under oppressive conditions. As no one knows what prices and money
values will be in the future, there is a preference for cash payments.
Credit is the most potent means to vivify the mass of capital which
exists in society. Without credit the scope of a given mass of capital
is notably restricted. The effect is especially paralysing at a period
when the mass of capital is greatly reduced by the ravages of war.</p>

<p>Another circumstance is not less harmful. Under existing
conditions there is little incentive to invest capital in undertakings,
which do not turn over their capital rapidly. Consequently there is the
strongest motive to employ capital in money &ndash; speculations
and usury instead of in industry. So long as a capitalist mode of
production exists, it is in the interest not only of the whole of
society, but also of the workers, that the available capital be
embarked upon productive industrial undertakings giving employment to
workers and increasing the sum of commodities. It should not
parasitically be employed in speculations and usury, which employ no
workers, yield no products, and only increase prices.</p>

<p>The system of paper money not only threatens the State with
complete bankruptcy, and with absolute worthlessness of the money which
it issues; it has brought growing confusion and paralysis into the
whole economic machinery.</p>

<p>This condition can only be dealt with by placing the State
finances upon a sound basis by balancing income and expenditure, so
that the activities of the printing press may be stopped. But how is
the State to obtain the revenue it needs so long as trade and commerce
are suspended? Thus we find ourselves in a vicious circle, out of which
there seems to be no way; economy cannot become healthy without sound
finances, and these cannot become sound unless economy becomes healthy.</p>

<p>A considerable improvement could be effected if normal
peaceful conditions were established among Georgia&rsquo;s
neighbours, if the civil war and campaign of conquest ceased in
Russia, Aserbaijan, Armenia, and Anatolia, and Georgia could find there
a market for its own products, and could also resume in full measure
its function as a trade channel connecting East with West.</p>

<p>This general condition of peace would alone lead to a marked
change in the economic position of Georgia.</p>

<p>It is also most desirable to remove the restrictions which
hamper the traffic of steamers through the Dardanelles, and which are
the result of the state of war still prevailing in that quarter. Then,
the postal communications between Georgia and the outside world must
be made more prompt and secure. The present state of these
communications is deplorable, which naturally prejudices all business
relations, with Europe.</p>

<p>Even when all these improvements have been introduced, the
overcoming of the financial crisis of the country will remain a very
difficult problem. It is hardly conceivable that the crisis can be
completely mastered without a foreign loan, which would cover the
deficit of the Exchequer for one or two years, and thus grant the State
a breathing space during which it can function without using the
printing press. If this respite were wisely and energetically used, it
should be sufficient to develop so far the economic resources of
Georgia that the finances could be placed on a stable foundation
without requiring further assistance from outside.</p>

<p>In this respect attention would naturally be paid first to an
increased exploitation of the national possessions, which involves the
building of railways, such as a line to the coal fields of
Tkvartschedi, and roads to open the great forests.</p>

<p>With all this is closely connected the encouragement of
agriculture. The drainage of 50,000 hectares of swamps at Poti, the
irrigation of 150,000 hectares in the east &ndash; for these
improvements the preliminary work of survey has already been done
&ndash; would suffice to render Georgia independent of outside help
for its sustenance.</p>

<p>An improvement of agriculture may already be expected from the
transformation of the peasant from, a leaseholder into a freeholder.
This process can be accelerated by the giving of instruction in
agriculture. It is true that the small extent of the holdings is an
obstacle to a rational system of agriculture which is to yield a
substantial surplus. And this surplus is all-important.</p>

<p>It is recognised even by many supporters of small holdings in
agriculture that large-scale production yields a larger net profit than
small undertakings, but of the latter it is asserted that the gross
yield is greater. But even if this is the case, it would not dispose us
more favourably to small holdings. The mass of mankind who live in
society outside of agriculture depend upon its net profits. We speak of
society and not of the State, because an individual State can find a
way out by importing the means of subsistence. Without a large surplus
from agriculture, there can be no large population of those engaged in
intellectual and industrial pursuits, no high level of civilisation,
and therefore no technical progress in agriculture itself. The
transformation of a rational system of large-scale agricultural
production into small holdings signifies a decrease in the surplus
yielded by agriculture. It means an increase in the amount of
labour-power required for agriculture, and a decrease in the
non-agricultural population, and thus a set-back to civilisation.
Militarists, who look to the peasants for numerous recruits, might well
be enthusiastic for small holdings. Modern Socialists, who have at
heart, not the strength of the armies, but the level of civilisation,
must support large-scale agriculture.</p>

<p>With the exception of the undertakings of the State and
municipalities, few opportunities existed for large-scale agriculture
in Georgia after the agrarian reforms. Large estates worked by private
capital are scarcely likely to arise.</p>

<p>Perhaps the transition stage to rational methods of
agriculture may give rise to the development of the communal direction
of husbandry. This is already the case with pasture land. Communal
agriculture would be large-scale cultivation.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why communal agriculture should be
adopted in Georgia. We have seen above that the old type of plough
requires ten to twenty animals to draw it, with four and more men,
of course, these resources are not at the disposal of an individual
small peasant. This difficulty is overcome by several peasants joining
together for ploughing their fields. Such co-operation is, constantly
found convenient for other purposes than ploughing. As many as fifty
small peasants combine together in order to perform the same work in
common on one of their fields after another, and thereby enjoy the
benefits of this co-operation. This practice is called by a special
name, Nadi, and the songs which are sung during work in common to give
to it the appropriate rhythm are called Naduri. This system of combined
labour would be more successful if the many small fields were not
separated, but thrown together and worked according to a common plan.
This should be made considerably easier after the partition of the
land has equalised the size of the separate holdings.</p>

<p>This process should also be aided by the introduction of
modern agricultural machines, which the individual peasant is too poor
to acquire, and which can be employed with success only over a large
extent of ground.</p>

<p>It is therefore probable that in Georgia a system of
cultivation by village communes will grow up, which, although not
socialistic in the sense that it produces for the market, yet will be a
nearer approach to Socialism, and a better organisation of labour-power
than agriculture which is based on small holdings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the domain of agriculture is not the only sphere
in which it is needful to make good as quickly as possible the effects
of the neglect and obstacles due to Feudalism and Absolutism. The
general level of civilisation must also be raised by an improvement in
education. In this province significant progress has been made by the
Socialist Government, in spite of its lack of resources.</p>

<p>Finally, it is absolutely necessary for the prosperity of
Georgia so to develop its industry that as far as possible the raw
materials are made use of in the place where they are produced. Paper
factories and furniture factories to realise the wealth in the form of
wood, factories for preserving fruit and vegetables, spinning and
weaving sheds for wool, silk and cotton are above all necessary. Next
to them are wanted factories for the production of implements and
simple machinery for agriculture.</p>

<p>We have seen that the municipalities and the co-operative
societies have already commenced to work on these lines. But we have
also pointed out that they can only proceed very slowly, if they are to
maintain a secure footing and avoid mistakes. Moreover, they suffer
from want of capital.</p>

<p>Here there must also be some assistance from abroad if the
development is to be rapid and energetic. Only the Western Powers and
America have the resources and experience available to permit large
undertakings of this kind to be established and properly directed
&ndash; But capitalism still prevails in those countries. For the
present, help can only take the form of the investment of foreign
capital in Georgian industrial undertakings.</p>

<p>Foreign loans to stabilise the State finances, to build
railways and construct irrigation and drainage works, and foreign
capital to establish factories are urgently necessary in the interests
of the Georgian people, and of the Georgian proletariat as well. Where
capitalist economy is still the order of the day, the worker thrives
best with a rapidly growing industrial capital. A suspension of
capitalist growth bits him the hardest.</p>

<p>The Georgian Socialist Government found itself in the
paradoxical situation of being obliged to create conditions which will
attract capital &ndash; that is, by promising a profit and giving
the necessary guarantee that one fine day it will not be expropriated
without compensation.</p>

<p>This was not an easy problem for a Socialist Government to
solve. But as this Government was composed of Menshevists, it was aware
of the economic necessities and would do voluntarily what the
Bolshevists are now compelled to do by circumstances, after they have
pursued the opposite policy for several years past, in the doing of
which they have fearfully devastated and ruined the whole of Russia.</p>
