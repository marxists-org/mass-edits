Natural Conditions</h3>

<p class="fst">WHAT we learn to know when visiting a
country are its forms and colours, and the character of its landscape.</p>

<p>At a first glance Georgia is bewitching, and this impression
deepens as the endless variety of its pictures disclose themselves
to our view. From a sea coast, with sub-tropical vegetation, the
Caucasus rises to a height of more than fifteen thousand feet. The
German explorer, Merzbacher, relates in his book, &ldquo;The
Caucasian Highlands,&rdquo; that from the summit of Elbrus (18,000
feet), he enjoyed a view which made such a powerful impression that
compared with it the peaks of the Central Alps only left a feeble
remembrance.</p>

<p>He also declares that the Via Mala, the Tamina, the
Liechtenstein Gorge, and other renowned places, were left far behind by
the wild, rocky scenery of the Tchegen, or of the Alasan and Korsuf
rivers. Neither the Bernese; Oberland nor Engadine, neither Judikarien
nor Cortina came near to equalling the Swanetnian landscape in the
grandeur of its proportions, in the harmony of its parts, in the wealth
of its vegetation, or in the splendour of its colours.</p>

<p>I have quoted the testimony of the classic explorer of the
mountains and peoples of the Caucasus, as I was prevented from enjoying
its beauties on the spot.</p>

<p>Merzbacher was as well acquainted with the Alps as with the
Caucasus, and others, who know both mountain ranges, consider the
beauty and dimensions of the Caucasus to be superior to those of the
Alps. If the reader will imagine the Bay of Naples to be a part of
Switzerland, he will get an idea of the variety and perfection of
nature to be found in Georgia.</p>

<p>Georgia not only combines sub-tropical coasts and glaciers,
but also contains a great fulness of vegetation, produced by the
tropical heat and great humidity, and close to this are and desert
regions. There is also a surprising number of medicinal springs of
various kinds, which burst out of the volcanic soil.</p>

<p>Georgia has much to offer to invalids as well as to nature
lovers and artists. Before the war, tourists and invalids, both from
Russia and from Western Europe, had begun to visit the wonderful
country whose attractions were heightened by the fact that, unlike
Switzerland and Italy, they were in many respects as yet untried. In
the Caucasus there are virgin forests and remote valleys which no
stranger has hitherto trodden. An evidence of the primitive character
of the country is furnished by the circumstance that large beasts of
prey are constantly met with there, as well as other kinds of wild
animals. Bear&rsquo;s flesh comes into the market at Tiflis for
sale, like beef with us, and at no higher price. On one occasion when,
out of curiosity, I bought some bear&rsquo;s flesh, I asked where
the bear had been shot, and was informed fifty miles from Tiflis
&ndash; quite near the capital, and not in some remote Caucasian
valley.</p>

<p>But Georgia is not only a veritable paradise for tourists,
sportsmen and invalids. Nature, also, felt obliged to please the
economists. Natural beauty and richness of soil, which are so seldom,
found together, are combined in Georgia to an extraordinary degree. The
soil is extremely fruitful and capable of bearing rich harvests of
southern and northern products, according to the position of the land.
Oranges, figs, olives and tea flourish on the coast of the Black Sea,
and cotton is cultivated towards Azerbaijan. Maize, wheat or
barley are sown almost everywhere. Georgia is particularly rich in
excellent wine, and seems to be the home of the grape, which grows wild
in the woods. Tobacco also thrives very well, and, in quality, seems to
be better than that of Trebizond. Nowhere have I seen such abundance of
fruit as in Georgia, and in this respect it can only he compared with
California. The Georgian mountains, especially the Caucasus, are
infinitely rich in valuable woods. In minerals, too, Georgia conceals
great treasures, of which the most important is the manganese of
Tchiaturi, which ranks as the richest in the world. The three most
considerable deposits of manganese are to be found in Brazil, India
and Georgia. In 1913 these countries exported:</p>

<p class="fst">Rich seams of coal are found in Georgia in
at least two places, and, in addition, iron, copper, lead, zinc, etc.</p>

<p>In antiquity the country was famed for its gold (whence the
legend of the Golden Fleece), but no gold mines are worked to-day. In
many copper and zinc mines small admixtures of gold are found in the
ore.</p>
