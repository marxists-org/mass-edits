Historical</h3>

<p class="fst">Thus Georgia lacks nothing to make her not
only one of the most beautiful, but also one of the richest countries
in the world. But the material position of the Georgians does not
depend merely upon the richness of the land in which they live; it is
also determined by the manner in which they have made use of it, and
the relations they are obliged to enter into with their neighbours. In
other words, it depends not only upon the natural, but also upon the
social and economic conditions in which they exist. And during recent
decades these conditions have been anything but brilliant in Georgia.</p>

<p>For about a thousand years Georgia was indeed favoured by its
geographical position, in that it came into contact with Greece through
the Black Sea.</p>

<p>The soil of many Greek States was too stony and sterile to
support their growing populations. As seafaring progressed the Greeks,
learned to fetch the corn which they needed from Southern Russia. Thus
they came into contact with the coasts of the Black Sea. They were also
attracted to Georgia by the gold which was then found there. As early
as the eighth century B.C. colonies were planted by Greek towns along
the Black Sea. The Georgians became acquainted with Greek civilisation
at a time when the Germans, or their predecessors, living in primeval
woods, stood on no higher plane of civilisation than the savage Indians
of North America when they were discovered by Europeans.</p>

<p>Even more than by gold, the Greeks must have been attracted to
Georgia because it provided so good a route, from the West to the East,
to the then rich territories of Persia and Central Asia. Eastern and
Western civilisation met in Georgia, and stimulated its intellectual
development.</p>

<p>But highways to rich countries attract not only the merchant,
but also the warrior, whether he be plunderer or conqueror. In the
degree in which the connection between West and East, Greece and
Central Asia, developed in Georgia, the clashes of Western and Eastern
armies became more frequent, and Georgia suffered devastation from
being made a theatre of war. But it always recovered speedily, so long
as it remained a highway of world commerce.</p>

<p>When, however, the Turks put an end to the Byzantine Empire,
conquered not only Asia Minor and Constantinople, but also the Balkan
Peninsula, and dominated the Black Sea, Georgia was cut off from Europe.</p>

<p>Henceforth the trade route from West to East was across the
Atlantic and Indian Oceans. At the same time, Persia and Central Asia
fell to pieces. Georgia lost more and more the capacity to make good
the consequences of the everlasting state of war. Its civilisation, its
prosperity, and even its population rapidly diminished. The only thing
that persisted throughout the perpetual feuds on its soil was the
feudal exploitation of the masses of peasants by numerous petty
princes; an exploitation which became more oppressive in the degree
that the peasant became poorer.</p>

<p>The consolidation of Russia brought about a change. The
struggle of the West against the robber nomads and conquerors who had
penetrated into Europe during the middle ages was first successfully
undertaken by Russia.</p>

<p>First the Tartars, and then the Turks, were pressed back by
the Moscow Czars who established their own authority over the territory
thus vacated. At the end of the eighteenth century they had been driven
back as far as the Caucasus.</p>

<p>In 1783, Catherine the Second concluded with the Georgian
King, Heraklius II, an agreement under which the latter accepted the
protection of the Empress. This protection did not save Georgia from
being again plundered by the Persians, but it prepared the way for the
complete subjugation of the country by the Russians, who annexed
Georgia as a province to their Empire in 1801.</p>

<p>The internal feuds and the hostile invasions now gradually
ceased. Still more important was the fact that Georgia was once more
able to enter into relations with Europe. But the representatives of
European civilisation were practically confined to Russian officials,
generals and aristocrats, who brought from Europe what they themselves
had assimilated, the external gloss which did not always sufficiently
hide Asiatic barbarism. The feudal oppression and exploitation was not
lightened, but even made heavier by the military and bureaucratic
regime.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Russian autocracy did not remain completely
unchallenged. The economic development created in the Russian Empire
revolutionary sections, which eventually became strong enough to give
battle to Absolutism, although, at first, only by means of underground
warfare.</p>

<p>In many of the Border States, which formerly had known a
separate political life, the struggle against Russian Absolutism became
especially intensive owing to the fact that it signified not merely the
breaking of the fetters of Absolutism and Feudalism, but also the
casting off of the foreign tyranny.</p>

<p>This was the case in Poland and also in Georgia. In these
countries all classes felt the pressure of the foreign bureaucracy in
the most severe form. In Poland the peasants were played off against
the large landowners, and sometimes favoured, but nothing like this
happened in Georgia. Those who were not masters of the Russian language
were everywhere degraded and excluded from all offices. Even in the
factories of Georgia a worker who had not undergone an examination in
Russian was liable to be refused employment. The growth of Georgian
resistance to the foreign yoke was assisted, for a time, by the
practice of the Russian Government in banishing to Georgia, as well as
to Siberia, its subversive subjects, such as Poles. This practice did
not last long, as Georgia commenced to mutiny in the middle of the
last century. It was then the turn of the Georgians themselves to be
banished, and they shared this fate in the fullest measure. The
struggle against Czardom had to be carried on with the aid of the ideas
of the more highly developed West. Not only the officials, the
military and the aristocrats, but also the revolutionaries of Russia
drew their knowledge and methods of thinking from Western Europe.</p>

<p>This occurred at a time when the revolutionary movement of
Russia received such an accession of strength that the Liberals had
become Conservative, and only the Socialists represented revolutionary
thought. Thus the Russian Revolutionaries became Socialists, in spite
of the weakness of the proletariat and its class struggle in the
Russian Empire. And just as the capitalists of Russia chose the more
perfected forms of European technique for the industry which they
founded, so the Socialists of Russia chose the most perfected form of
Socialism, the Marxian.</p>

<p>This also applied to Georgia. There only for a short time the
Opposition movement was led by the aristocracy, as in Poland, and
possessed a purely nationalist character. At the time when serfdom was
abolished in Russia an echo was heard in Georgia in the form of
peasant unrest, which was suppressed with bloodshed.</p>

<p>The Opposition movement first became strong and systematic
when industrial capital was attracted to Georgia by the building of a
railway from Tiflis to Baku (commenced in 1880); by the increasing
significance of petroleum production in Baku, and its growing exports
of that article. Although capitalism was still in an undeveloped stage,
Socialism of the Marxian kind took root in Georgia at this time. In the
ten years between 1890 and 1900 the Socialist movement rapidly gained
in strength.</p>

<p>Its first champions were the practical organisers and
agitators Sylvester Jibladse and N. Tcheidze, with whom was soon
associated the publicist and theoretician, Noe Jordania, who did even
more for Georgia than Plechanoff did for Russia, as he remained in the
country instead of working from a place of exile, and as he united the
talents of the practical fighter with the activities of the thinker and
publicist.</p>

<p>The first strike in Tiflis took place in the year 1896, and
the First of May was celebrated in that town from 1899 onwards.</p>

<p>In the following year, on May 1st, 1900, a workers&rsquo;
festival was arranged, at which about five hundred workers were
present. The most hopeful outlook prevailed, and for the first time
revolutionary songs were heard in the Georgian language, in the midst
of banners with the portraits of Marx, Lassalle and Engels.</p>

<p>In the same year the Socialist organisations of Georgia joined
up with the Social-Democratic Party of Russia, which was formed at that
time.</p>

<p>The Georgian Socialists did not desire that local
particularism should cut them off from the mass of the struggling
proletariat of Russia. From the very first they attached importance to
the ideal of international solidarity as opposed to Georgian
nationalism. Without depreciating the demand of the Georgian nation for
self-determination, they believed this would be most effectually
promoted within the sphere of the Russian Social-Democracy, which stood
for universal self-determination. Unlike the Polish Socialists, they
entered the International as Russian Social Democrats.</p>

<p>The International did not include any separate Georgian
Social-Democratic Party. By adopting this course, however, the
Socialists of Georgia became involved in all the errors and confusions
through which Russian Socialism has passed.</p>

<p>In contrast to Georgia, where the Proletarian movement has
nearly always remained true to Marxian Social-Democracy, the Socialist
movement of Russia has been split into various sections.</p>

<p>On the one hand was the Social-Democracy, with tendencies in
line with the thought of Western Europe, and postulating an advanced
stage of capitalism as the indispensable preliminary to Socialism; and,
on the other hand, was the Social Revolutionary Party with a specific
Russian Socialism, which it sought to base rather upon the peasants and
the vestiges of village communism than upon the proletariat. These
doctrines could scarcely find any support in Georgia, as in that
country village communism had completely disappeared.</p>

<p>An antagonism soon arose within the ranks of the Russian
Social-Democracy between divergent conceptions of Marxism. The first
conception, which may be called that of Western Europe, emphasised the
importance of the economic movement, and the other, or Russian
conception perceived in force not merely the midwife but the creator of
a new society. The first conception involved, in particular, the
development of the self-consciousness and the independent activity of
the proletariat, and consequently favoured Democracy, which alone
formed the groundwork for this development; and the other conception
saw in the proletariat merely a tool to be wielded by a small and
resolute organisation of Socialists. Those holding the first condition
remained true to the Marxian method, which they consistently employed
in spite of all the difficulties which arose from the economic and
political backwardness of the country; those holding the other
conception began by substituting the dictatorship of a conspiracy
society for democracy within the party organisation; and from this
point they tended to move farther away from the Marxian method towards
the pre-Marxian ideas of Blanqui and Weitling. The more the members of
this section deviated from Marxian methods, the more obstinately they
clung to Marxian phrases the better to exploit the repute in which the
name of Marx was hold in Russia, and they expended all their energies
upon learning by heart such phrases as suited them, which they
interpreted in their own way. In place of Marxian science they set up
Marxian scholastics.</p>

<p>In the early days of this split, which occurred in 1903 the
Georgian Social Democrats ranged themselves on the side that was
dominated by the Marxian and Western European outlook, that is, on the
side of the Mensheviks.</p>

<p>They soon became the strongest element in this section, to
which they remained absolutely loyal. In Russia, on the other hand,
there were constant fluctuations in the relative strength of the
Menshevists and the Bolshevists. Yet the general tendency of the
Russian proletarian movement showed itself to be very favourable to
Bolshevism. Certainly the Bolshevists were the worst Marxians, but
their preponderance was to be explained on Marxist lines by the special
conditions in which the class struggle was carried on in Russia. In
Georgia, and also in Poland, which stood in national opposition to
Russia, the special Russian form of Marxism found no foothold. The
Georgian Social-Democrats were the picked troops of Russian Menshevism.
Consequently, from the commencement Georgia appeared to Bolshevism as
the enemy deserving the most bitter hatred, and to-day it has become
the hereditary enemy. After the first Russian Revolution, Georgia was
the country which constantly returned the largest Menshevist majority
in the Duma Elections since 1906, and which furnished many of the
Menshevist martyrs.</p>

<p>Scarcely one of the leading comrades in Tiflis whom I have
recently met has not made acquaintance with Siberia.</p>

<p>Georgia also provided the Russian Party with a series of its
best leaders and representatives. Jordania, Ramishvily, Tsereteli,
Japaridze, Tcheidse, Lomtatidze, Gegetchkori, Macharadze and Tchenkeli
played in Petrograd a political role not less important than in Tiflis.</p>

<p>The Social-Democratic fraction of the last Russian Duma before
the October Revolution chose the same Tcheidse to be its leader. It
voted against war credits and adhered to the Zimmerwald Conference. It
was Tcheidse who read the Zimmerwaldian manifesto in the Duma. And when
the 1917 Revolution created the Workers&rsquo; Councils, Tcheidse
was chosen President of the Petrograd Workers&rsquo; Council
&ndash; a product of the confidence reposed in him by the Russian
proletariat through his parliamentary activity.</p>

<p>By the side of Tcheidse in the Petrograd Workers&rsquo;
Council was the Georgian Tsereteli, who had hastened there from his
Siberian place of exile.</p>

<p>The Menshevists were not able to assert themselves in Russia.
They were too weak to carry out their peace policy in opposition to
the war policy of the Cadets, in coalition with whom they had formed a
ministry, of which Tsereteli was a member; and, they could not decide
to support the Bolshevist agitation, which aimed at the dissolution of
the Army before the conclusion of peace, and the complete sacrifice of
Russia to German, Austrian and Turkish invasion, plundering and
conquest.</p>

<p>The middle course which the Menshevists would have pursued was
well conceived. But as is so often the case in history when great and
irreconcilable oppositions come into conflict, those who worked for the
final result which was given by the parallelogram of forces were
paralysed by the clash of the antagonisms, and only after the strength
of the two extremes had been exhausted was this object of the middle
party to be finally attained.</p>

<p>Thus the Menshevists were soon eclipsed in Russia, but not in
Georgia. In that country there were no Cadets, and no Bolshevists of
importance. The majority of the Socialists of Georgia, supported by
Jordania, had been unfriendly to the Coalition policy, and demanded a
purely Socialist ministry. The Revolution brought the Social-Democracy
of Georgia, as a compact and resolute party, to a dominant position,
which was not seriously contested from any quarter in the country.</p>

<p>But it was a bad heritage into which this party entered. The
immediate situation was desperate, in view of the masses of Russian
soldiers, filled with Bolshevist hatred against Menshevist Georgia,
which in their retreat from the yet more hostile and ferocious Turks,
broke up into plundering bands and swarmed into Georgia.</p>

<p>Apart from this, the economic position of the country was
grievous in the extreme, and its enduring power was slight. Even before
the war it had suffered considerably from the neglect of its
agriculture and its industry, and the inadequacy of its means of
communication. And to this was now added the devastation of four years
of war, and protracted isolation from the industry and civilisation of
Europe.</p>
