Agriculture</h3>

<p class="fst">Even to-day the land of Georgia is
cultivated in the most primitive fashion. There, as elsewhere, feudal
dependence and the prevalence of short leases impeded the development
of agriculture. The implements of Georgian agriculture reminded German
observers, only a short time ago, of Biblical times.</p>

<p>In 1905, Paul Hoffmann wrote, in his book on <strong>German
Colonies in Transcaucasia</strong>, as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Only in recent times have
modern ploughs been widely used in Transcaucasia, and the colonists are
still partly assisted by the wooden ploughs of the Georgians.&ldquo;</p>

<p class="fst">If this is the case with the German
colonists, who represent a higher type of agriculture, it applies still
more to the Georgian peasants themselves. The plough does not penetrate
the soil very deep, and requires an uncommonly strong team, five to ten
pairs of buffaloes. Merzbacher saw ploughs drawn by twenty-four
animals, which needed seven men to guide them. What an expenditure of
energy to secure a scanty result. Thrashing is managed with a thrashing
sledge, provided with a flint, which appeared to Merzbacher to be a
relic of the stone age.</p>

<p>The methods of soil cultivation are as primitive as the
implements used. Rotation of crops and artificial manuring are quite
unknown. The tillage resembles the system which existed in Germany at
the time of Charles the Great. The same crop, whether wheat or barley,
is planted year in and year out in the same field, sometimes three
years in succession, until the harvest decreases. Grass is then allowed
to grow, and the soil is used as pasture, again for several years in
succession, when it is sown once more with crops.</p>

<p>The cattle which is put on the pastures is small and
insignificant, at least the horned cattle. The absence of the
cultivation of fodder is not only prejudicial to the raising of cattle
and to agriculture, but also to afforestation. The sheep and goats ruin
the woods, and destroy every after-growth of trees, especially in the
eastern and dry regions. We have spoken above of the boundless riches
of Georgia in wood, but these are very unevenly distributed. Wood is to
be found in the districts of the Black Sea, and in the
hardly-accessible and sparsely populated districts of the Caucasus. The
drier and more populous districts are in many cases completely woodless.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, not a single tree is to be found on the
whole range of mountains which surrounds Tiflis. Nor is there any trace
of soil tillage in these desert places, which scarcely yields
sustenance for goats.</p>

<p>The growing destruction of the woods increases the dryness of
the climate, and therefore the danger of harvest failures. In former
times this danger was averted by great irrigation works. As in so many
other countries of the East, Egypt, Mesopotamia and Central Asia, there
were great territories in Georgia which, with the aid of artificial
irrigation gave the richest harvests, without which they would have
remained sterile. The laying out of irrigation canals was an important
task of the old Oriental Governments.</p>

<p>Since that time these territories have passed under the sway
of rulers who sprang from the nomad peoples of the Steppes, and who had
no understanding of the importance of such works. They exhausted all
the energies of their lands in warlike undertakings. In the course of
recent centuries the irrigation works in these countries haves
everywhere fallen into decay, and consequently prosperity and
civilisation have shrunk.</p>

<p>In the Thirteenth Century the population of Transcaucasia was
estimated to be sixteen millions. To-day it amounts to hardly one-third
of this number.</p>

<p>But even this third does not find sufficient support in its
own country. Georgia required constant imports of corn, which it could
easily receive from neighbouring South Russia. These imports were paid
for with tobacco and wine, which are produced in abundance in Georgia.
The Russian Government encouraged this commerce, which was to the
interest of the great wheat growers, who found in Georgia a market
close at hand for their surplus corn, and received cheap wine and
tobacco in exchange. If not for the cultivation of wheat, the Russian
Government has done much to promote the culture of the vine
in Georgia, and, in addition, has aided the production of tea. The
vine, tea, olives, and almonds are in many parts carefully cultivated.
The remarks upon the backwardness of agriculture do not apply to these
crops. Nevertheless, owing to the primitive character of its
agriculture, an agrarian country like Georgia was not a little
dependent upon a foreign market for its sustenance.</p>

<p>War and revolution would, therefore, menace the country in the
extreme. Bolshevism has cut off Georgia from the corn granaries of
South Russia, and deprived the country of the markets for its surplus
products. At the same time the aftermath of the war has rendered it
extremely difficult for Georgia to find new markets in Western Europe,
and fresh corn providers in America and Australia. This explains the
food difficulties which we find in a country so richly dowered by
nature, and in which over eighty per cent of the population live by
agriculture.</p>

<p>In addition to the backwardness of the mode of production,
another circumstance contributed to diminish the yield of agriculture,
by decreasing the amount of labour power which was engaged in it.</p>

<p>This factor is malaria, which in the most fruitful districts
is a scourge to the country, and paralyses the strength and energy of
numerous inhabitants during the best years of their lives. If the
dryness necessitates great irrigation works, in order to increase the
fertility of the country, malaria, on the other hand, is best grappled
with by draining the swamps which occupy wide stretches of land,
especially about the Black Sea. The overcoming of malaria would not
merely raise the labour power of the inhabitants, but would also rescue
new land for cultivation. Both irrigation and draining works were
equally neglected by the Russian Government.</p>
