Capitalism and Socialism</h3>

<p class="fst">However difficult it may be for a Socialist
Government supported by the political power of the proletariat to be
obliged to encourage capitalist industry, this is a problem which
sooner or later confronts the Socialists in every European country. In
the most important States the proletariat is already so strong and so
matured in self-consciousness that it will not be long before it
attains to political power, not in spite of democracy, but precisely
because its strength is nourished by democracy.</p>

<p>A world revolution in the Bolshevist sense is, of course, not
to be reckoned with. Such a revolution signifies the dictatorship of a
Communist party, which assumes power because it alone controls all
armed forces and disarms all the non-proletarian classes and the
sections of the proletariat which are not Communist. This situation
arose after the military collapse, first in Russia, and then, in
Hungary. It will not be repeated in any country, least of all in the
victorious States.</p>

<p>In these countries the proletariat cannot gain the upper hand
by means of a monopoly of arms, but only as a majority by means of its
preponderance among the democracy.</p>

<p>At the moment the democratic prospects of Social Democracy
are, in point of fact not favourable. The period of disillusionment and
tension which follows upon every revolution has once more set in.
Instead of a world revolution we stand on the threshold of a general
reaction.</p>

<p>But in no part of civilised Europe has Socialism, to-day
suffered such a crushing defeat as was experienced by the middle-class
revolution of 1849, and the Paris Commune of 1871. After these defeats
the reaction lasted barely a dozen years, and this time it will be much
shorter, perhaps only a matter of two or three years. It can be
terminated in no other way than by the victory of Social Democracy in
all civilised States, a Social Democracy which will not only be far
stronger than it is to-day, but also, far more intelligent and
experienced, thanks to the lessons of the present revolution, and
thanks to the possibilities of a richer development of the capacity of
the proletariat through shorter working hours, workers&rsquo;
councils and other achievements which even the reaction will be obliged
to leave intact. In a few years&rsquo; time Social Democracy will
find a far better economic foundation for its activities than to-day,
as by that time the worst effects of the war may have been overcome.</p>

<p>But then all the Social-Democratic Governments will be faced
by the same difficulties as confronted the Georgian Government. Because
of what the revolution has taught them, they will know that capitalism
cannot be abolished at one stroke. Socialistic production can only be
introduced gradually, and after careful preparation. If the wheels of
production are not to come to a standstill, and thereby plunge the
whole of society, and especially the proletariat, into the direst
poverty, capitalistic production must be maintained in those branches
of industry which are not yet to be socialised, and in some branches of
production it may survive for generations.</p>

<p>We may therefore expect to see everywhere Socialist
governments which will have to allow, and even encourage, capitalist
production, in a whole series of branches of industry.</p>

<p>How is the rule of the proletariat to be expressed under
these circumstances?</p>

<p>The desire for profit or the extraction of surplus value from
the labour-power that is purchased is not the only cause of the class
antagonism between capital and labour. This antagonism is also
nourished by the power over labour which is invested in capital by its
monopoly of the means of production. Every kind of social co-operation
requires to be directed. But the capitalist becomes a captain of
industry because he owns the means of production, and not because the
workers and consumers have any confidence in his capacity or
experience. In capitalist undertakings the master was originally an
autocrat, who not merely managed the business, but dominated it
personally, and gave it a code of rules. The worker was the object, not
the subject of this legislation.</p>

<p>The struggle of the worker against capital is not merely
directed against exploitation; that is, against the creation of surplus
value, but also against the omnipotence of the captain of industry,
against the attitude of &ldquo;master in the house&ldquo;.</p>

<p>Both parts of the class struggle are inseparable and closely
connected with each other. In the one case, the restriction of the
omnipotence of capital, visible progress is achieved during the
lifetime of capitalism, but not in the other case, the struggle against
the exploitation of the workers. In the latter case, progress is only
made through increasing encroachments upon the domain of capitalistic
production, and the extension of socialisation. As regards the
first-named aspect of the class struggle, progress commenced to be made
one hundred years ago, but in respect of the second aspect, it has
scarcely begun as yet. The power of the master in industry tends to be
restricted by the growing force of Labour organisations and of the
State, &ldquo;the organised power of society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this does not cause a diminution in the exploitation of
labour, which often shows a tendency to increase. Every labour
protection law, every factory inspector, every successful strike, every
trade union which asserts itself, lessens the power of the captain of
industry. The revolution has considerably multiplied these
restrictions, and added to them a new one in the shape of works
councils.</p>

<p>Thus, while during the course of the last century the factory
has been transformed from an autocracy into a constitutional monarchy,
the rate of surplus value has grown in the same period so that the
tendency in the rate of profit to fall has been always impeded.</p>

<p>This is not an accident. The great historical task of
industrial capitalism consists in increasing the productive power of
Labour to an enormous extent. This fact enables it to win easy triumphs
in competition with pre-capitalistic modes of production.</p>

<p>Only such restrictions as do not impair the productivity of
labour can be imposed and maintained. The measures and institutions
which we now have in mind have the effect of raising instead of
lowering the productivity of labour. They increase the capacity and
intelligence of the worker, and give him an interest in the work and in
the prosperity of the undertaking and branch of industry to which he
belongs. Their educational influence is not confined to the worker,
but also extends to the employer. Nothing is more convenient or more
simple than dictatorial power which does not need to exercise the mind
in order to overcome all opposition. The dictum of Cavour that any
fool could govern in a state of siege is quoted with approval by people
who are enthusiastic for the dictatorship that is only another name for
a state of siege. Where the employer can act and rule as dictator, he
can pass on all the consequences of incapacity, carelessness and
niggardliness in the conduct of the business to the workers, who are
obliged to pay the penalty for obsolete methods and improper conduct of
a business, and for the lack of requisite materials. The stronger the
workers and the State become in comparison with the employer, the
greater their demands upon him, and their powers of resisting him, the
more careful and intelligent the conduct of the business must be, the
more the employer must endeavour to make use of the most productive
appliances and methods, the more of the extracted surplus value must be
accumulated by the capitalist to permit the introduction of
improvements.</p>

<p>In this way each step of progress made by the proletariat
against capital, which is inspired by economic foresight, and therefore
does not aim at the destruction of machinery and similar things,
results in creating a strong incentive to increase the productive
power of labour, which also involves the tendency to the growth of
surplus value and exploitation.</p>

<p>However paradoxical it may appear, the growth of the power of
the working class ever capital does not at the same time exclude the
progression of the exploitation of that class, but may even provoke it.</p>

<p>This explains why such growth does not impede the progress
and development of production, but promotes it. So long as capitalistic
production subsists, capital must extract a profit from industry, or
else mark time, which harms the worker even more than the capitalist,
as the former is dependent on the uninterrupted sale of his labour
power. Crises and unemployment are the worst enemies of the worker, and
nothing is greater than the folly of those
&ldquo;revolutionaries&rdquo; who seek to save the proletariat
by clogging the wheels of production, and increasing the gravity of the
crisis. The workers&rsquo; councils will become effective and make
themselves a definite power in the process of production, when they
succeed in the same way as labour protection and Trade Unions have
succeeded, in raising the productivity of labour. If they should aim at
decreasing it and permanently impeding the process of production, they
would be soon played out. The necessities of production are the most
irresistible of the needs of society. They show themselves to be more
potent than the bloodiest terrorism.</p>

<p>As long as capitalist production lasts, it will involve the
necessity of a certain rate of profit, and the tendency to the growth
of exploitation.</p>

<p>It will be possible to remove these necessities and these
tendencies when Socialist production is substituted for capitalist
production, and social property is established in place of private
property. The possibilities of this transition first arise in an
advanced stage of capitalism, but not for all branches of industry at
the same time. Railways, mines, and forests are by their nature suited
to become social possessions, but most luxury trades will remain in
private hands until a later period. The abolition of exploitation by
means of socialisation can therefore only proceed gradually, and the
whole of industry cannot be liberated at one stroke. On the other hand,
many restrictions of the power of the employer, such as the eight-hour
day or workers&rsquo; councils, may be imposed upon the whole
extent of industry at once.</p>

<p>The mass of surplus value in society, which is appropriated by
the capitalist class instead of falling to the workers or being used in
the general interests of society, will not be diminished as a result of
the increased power in the process of production which the working
class secures, but will be decreased in the degree that the scope of
the capitalist is narrowed by the socialisation of single branches of
industry. It is quite impossible to cut away profit from those branches
of industry, constantly diminishing in number, where capitalist
production still exists, and may continue to exist for the present,
before the private character of the ownership of such means of
production is altered.</p>

<p>The abolition or even the visible restriction of profit in
this sphere would clog production generally. Matters would only become
worse if an attempt were made to restart businesses by means of a
policy of terrorism. Where the employer is superfluous, industry should
be socialised. Where he is still necessary, he cannot be compelled by
force to manage his business in a reasonable and conscientious manner,
just as the war worker cannot be coerced into doing good work. Not
compulsion, but interest in the result secures the best quality work,
on the part of employers as on the part of wage workers.</p>

<p>All this may not sound very revolutionary, but Marx would not
have devoted the best years of his life to the writing of <strong>Capital</strong>,
and this would not have been greeted as the &ldquo;Bible of the
working classes,&rdquo; if the mere possession of power had
sufficed for the emancipation of the working class, and a knowledge of
the laws of capitalist economy had been superfluous.</p>

<p>A Socialist Government must take these laws into
consideration. As regards this point, the distinction between a
socialist and a non-socialist government is of the following
description. The problem of the socialisation of a branch of industry
has two sides, one, the degree of its economic development,
particularly the concentration of its capital and resources, the nature
of its direction (whether by employer or by managers), and the
conditions of the market for its goods. The other aspect, which is most
important, is the power of the classes which are interested in
socialisation. A number of branches of trade and industry have long
been ripe for socialisation, and urgently require it, in the general
social interest as well as for the benefit of the proletariat. But the
principle of socialisation remains unapplied, because its champions are
weak. On the other hand, there is a whole category of restrictions
which could be imposed upon the power of capital without lessening the
productivity of labour, which they would even raise, and which are not
yet put into force because the proletariat lacks the requisite power
to do so.</p>

<p>When the Proletariat is strong enough to put a Socialist
Government in power, this step will enable it to enforce all necessary
measures of socialisation, and to impose all reasonable restrictions
upon the will of the employer. But every care must be taken to avoid
over-estimating the efficacy of mere power, and thinking that its
possession alone is sufficient to ensure the fulfilment of the desires
and the satisfaction of the wants of the proletariat at one stroke.</p>

<p>A Socialist Government must always keep steadily in mind that
its activities are restricted by the economic necessities and
possibilities, and it may not overstep these limitations without
jeopardising society and the progress of the workers to better
conditions of living. With every measure of socialisation, it must
verify exactly the condition of the branch of industry, and the
capabilities and resources which are at its disposal. With every
limitation which it sets upon the will of the employer, it must
consider whether the productivity of labour will not thereby be
lessened. It must ceaselessly strive to develop the productive forces
of the country, and, in so far as this is not yet possible by socialist
means and methods, capitalist measures to further this object must be
permitted, and under circumstances even encouraged.</p>

<p>The Social-Democratic Government of Georgia has been guided by
these principles, and in this have shown themselves to be intelligent
pupils of our great Masters, Marx and Engels. Whenever a
Social-Democratic Government may come into power, it will be obliged to
act on the same principles, and the benefit of the Georgian experience
will be at its disposal.</p>

<p>The idea that the only task of a Socialist Government is to
put Socialism into practice is not a Marxist one, but pre-Marxist and
utopian. It conceives of Socialism as an ideal picture of a complete
society. Like ideal conceptions generally, its nature is very simple.
Once it has been thought out, only the necessary power is required to
realise this ideal everywhere and under all circumstances. When this
result does not immediately follow on the possession of power, it is
due either to treachery or to cowardice. A Socialist Government has no
other task than the putting into practice of the ideal Socialist State.
The more absolute its power, the more effectually it will be able to do
this.</p>

<p>This conception of the task of Socialism was completely upset
by Marxism. The starting point of Marxism was the class struggle, which
is waged under the conditions of capitalist production by the
proletariat, itself the product of industrial capitalism. The task of
Social Democracy is to raise the physical, intellectual, moral and
organising powers of the proletariat, as well as to bring plan, and
method into the isolated proletarian struggles. This implies that the
proletariat must be taught what is the social and economic objective
which can alone satisfy it, and put an end to its struggles. This
objective is the emancipation of the working class, which from being
the mere tool will become the master of production. Among the working
class must be counted not only the industrial proletariat, but
likewise, peasants, hand-workers, and intellectuals. But the
proletariat forms the strongest and most dependable factor in this
development.</p>

<p>This objective is the goal of the Socialist movement. Its
realisation, may come about in various ways, which will depend upon the
prevailing modes of production, the relative strength of classes, the
degree of their organisation, intelligence and discipline, and so
forth. The forms of Socialism may vary considerably in different
countries, at different times, and in different branches of industry.
They must everywhere be related to the existing forms of production,
and permit their further development.</p>

<p>The common element of all of them will be the common
ownership of the means of production and management by social
institutions, with the object of satisfying the common need whether
that be the need of the State, the Municipality, or Co-operative
Societies, instead of private ownership of the means of production and
private production for the market to secure private profit. Production
will not be the realisation of an ideal conception of a complete
society which has been previously thought out, but the result of a
fluctuating process of development, a result which in no way excludes
or renders unnecessary further development, but which forms merely the
starting point of a new order of social development.</p>

<p>The endeavour can and should be made to-day to visualise the
picture of the coming Socialist mode of production, but it must also
be remembered that the reality will be far different from any mental
picture, and that the most thorough investigations at the present time
will never succeed in revealing all of the agents that will enter into
the development of the future, and in estimating how great a
significance every one of these agents will assume. The better we are
able to investigate the present, the deeper will be our insight into
the future. But the forms of the future society will always be more
manifold than is possible for us to foresee, and new momenta will
constantly arise which are inconceivable to us to-day.</p>

<p>We may expect great surprises before us in this sphere.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Socialist goal has a great significance for
us. Champions of the Labour cause will the more readily avoid the
contradictions and waste of strength in their daily political and
economic policies, and effect the improvement and liberation of the
working people the more speedily, the more they estimate how far each
one of their demands and measures will subserve or prejudice the
ultimate objective.</p>

<p>As we have already observed, the development of the
productivity of labour is closely connected with the objective of the
transformation of the property basis of the means of production and
with the establishment of the widest self-government and freedom, of
expression and organisation of the labouring masses.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of this conception, the task of Socialists
in relation to Socialism assumes a shape very different from the
standpoint of pre-Marxian Socialism. The creation of a system of
Socialist production is now neither the sole nor the first task of
Socialists. Such a system is rather to be considered as the end of
their endeavour, the result of their total activity. Their duty is,
under all circumstances, the elevation and strengthening of the
proletariat, the giving it a keener insight into the economic process,
and its destiny and the extension of the productivity of labour.</p>

<p>This is the task of every Socialist party. From this point of
view, Socialist parties will become possible and necessary everywhere,
even in countries where the pre-requisites of Socialist production do
not yet exist, provided that they contain an industrial proletariat.</p>

<p>The position will be in no way modified when a Socialist party
gains political power, which permits it to set up a Socialist
Government. The immediate task of such a government would likewise be
to increase the strength and insight of the proletariat, to subject the
capitalist to the control of the State, and to develop the productivity
of labour, but not under all circumstances immediately to abolish
capitalism in its entirety, and put Socialism into practice. To how
great an extent Socialism can be introduced must depend upon the degree
of ripeness which the country has reached.</p>

<p>If the tasks of a Socialist Government are conceived in this
wise, it will be clear that the existence of such a government in an
economically backward country is compatible with the Marxist theory,
according to which the pre-requisites of Socialism, are only to be
found in a highly developed capitalism. A socialist regime is thus
possible under economically backward conditions, if the State is
democratic, and the industrial proletariat is superior in intelligence
and organisation to the other classes which express their strength by
and through democracy. Provided also that the Socialist government
remains always conscious of the limits of its power and does not
attempt more than it can achieve with the strength and resources at
its disposal, and if, finally, it is anxious to develop the productive
forces and to strengthen the proletariat. From being the champion of
the special interests of the proletariat it will become the
representative of the general social interests. In this capacity it
will be enabled to marshal behind it the majority of the nation and
maintain their allegiance.</p>

<p>Such a Government must be guided by the principle that by
limitation the master reveals himself. A Socialist Government which
does not restrict its endeavours to the economic necessities and
possibilities, but allows itself to be influenced only by the needs of
the proletarians and the eagerness for power of many party friends, so
that it plunges into an immoderate policy of extravagant radicalism, a
Socialist Government of this kind will never accomplish a lasting
liberation of the proletariat, and an increase in the productive
forces, but it is sure to end in a new servitude by completely
destroying the productive forces, which will mean an indefinite
postponement of its hopes.</p>

<p>The Government of Georgia has chosen the method of masterly
limitation, and the country and the proletariat have felt the benefit
of it.</p>

<p>It is true that an economically backward country can never
become a pioneer in the development of Socialist forms. So far, Marxism
requires no modification. Only such advanced industrial countries as
England and Germany can develop models of socially worked undertakings,
which, owing to the abject lesson they will teach, will find speedy
recognition and imitation in backward countries.</p>

<p>If highly developed countries should soon come under a
Socialist regime, this fact will determine whether their assistance
will cause the further development of the productive forces in backward
countries to assume socialist forms and prevent the widening of the
scope of capitalist production.</p>

<p>It is within the realm of possibility that such a regime will
appear in Germany and England in the course of a few years after the
present reaction has been overcome.</p>

<p>This will provide a Socialist Government in Georgia with a new
support. Thus the possibility existed that this Government would be
able to maintain itself in power without resistance. The immediate
danger was not from within but from without.</p>
