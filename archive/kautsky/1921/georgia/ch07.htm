The Armed Forces of Georgia</h3>

<p class="fst">The Social-Democrats of Georgia are
pacifists in the sense that they abhor war and avoid it as much as
possible, but not in the sense that they refuse to meet force with
force and deliver themselves unarmed into the hands of their opponents,
merely seeking to influence them by words. Where it is threatened by
force, Democracy also requires to defend itself by force.</p>

<p>Thus, when the Social Democracy of Georgia became a power, it
was obliged to provide itself with weapons. In the Revolution of 1905,
the Georgian Social-Democrats urged the arming of the proletariat, but
events taught them greater wisdom. The possession of arms by the
proletariat causes some of them to have the feelings of bandits, and
leads them to individual acts of violence and crime. The question once
again became acute in the Revolution of 1917.</p>

<p>When the delirious joy which marked the beginning was followed
by a soberness, many comrades, even in Georgia, discussed the question
of how the Revolution could be defended against a threatened armed
attack from the counter revolution. It thus appeared to be necessary to
arm the working class, but not all workers without distinction.</p>

<p>Only tried and disciplined comrades should receive arms.</p>

<p>The workers&rsquo; guard was founded on the 5th September,
1917.</p>

<p>At the beginning it was of slight account, as it lacked arms.
In December the necessity and likewise the possibility of arming a
larger body of men arose out of a conflict between the workers of
Tiflis and the soldiers&rsquo; council there.</p>

<p>In Tiflis, like everywhere else in Russia, a
workers&rsquo; council had been formed, and Noe Jordania,
afterwards President of the Republic, chosen as president.</p>

<p>The whole power in Tiflis devolved on the workers&rsquo;
council, when, after the Bolshevist coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat,
the Russian armies dissolved, and came swarming over the Turkish
border. Georgia, whose language they did not understand, appeared to
the Russian soldiers as a foreign country. Naturally inclined to
plunder, as is every army whose discipline has disappeared, they were
all the more eager for plunder in a district where they felt they
were foreigners. Moreover, as the soldiers were dominated by the
spirit of Bolshevism, which at that time meant the complete surrender
of the country to the hostile armies, they were not favourably disposed
towards the Georgian Menshevists, who did not consider the senseless
retreat from the by no means victorious Turks to be necessary, however
much they were convinced of the need for an immediate armistice and
peace. As a matter of fact, the Menshevist Transcaucasian Commissariat
succeeded in concluding an armistice with the Turks on the 18th
December.</p>

<p>At the beginning of December the disorganised masses of
returning soldiers threatened the security of the population of Tiflis
to the utmost. In order to protect the population, the Tiflis
Workers&rsquo; Council demanded arms for the workers&rsquo;
guard. The arms could be obtained only from the Arsenal, which was in
the hands of the returned soldiers. The Menshevist Workers&rsquo;
Council requested of the Bolshevist Soldiers&rsquo; Council the
delivery of weapons for arming the workers&rsquo; guard. This the
Soldiers&rsquo; Council refused.</p>

<p>Thereupon, the Workers&rsquo; Council decided to help
themselves and to capture the Arsenal. It was a hazardous enterprise.
Only 225 armed men were at its disposal, whereas the Tiflis garrison
numbered 20,000 men. Nevertheless, the stroke was successful. In the
early morning of the 12th December they attacked the Arsenal and
captured it after a short struggle, in which only one soldier fell.
This success revealed the great war weariness, apathy and
demoralisation which had overtaken the Russian Army, as well as the
fearlessness and defensive capacity of the Georgian proletariat. We
have already noted that all sections of the population of Georgia are
characterised by the economic carelessness and love of enjoyment which
is a heritage of Feudalism. To this heritage must also be added a
striking valour in the best sense of the word.</p>

<p>After the 26th May, the date of the Declaration of
Independence, the 12th December is celebrated in Georgia as a national
holiday. On that day the Georgian Social-Democracy captured the arms to
defend itself against subsequent attacks.</p>

<p>The Workers&rsquo; Guards now disposed of sufficient arms,
and were able to organise themselves in battalions. Their name varied;
first they called themselves the revolutionary militia, then the Red
Guard, and finally the People&rsquo;s Guard.</p>

<p>From Tiflis they spread themselves over the whole of Georgia.
They constituted a volunteer army of tried Socialists and numbered
about 30,000 men.</p>

<p>Only a part of them were armed in time of peace, the majority
being on furlough and following their callings. If the Republic had
been in danger, they would have been called up by the General Staff,
supplied with arms, and allotted to their places.</p>

<p>The constitution of the Guard was democratic. Its affairs were
decided by Congresses, to which every 200 men sent a delegate. The
Guard belonging to a district selected its officers. Likewise, the
General Staff is chosen for one year. Its Supreme Commander was Valike
Jugeli, who was the leader in the bold stroke of the 12th December 1917.</p>

<p>The Guard was not under the control of the War Minister, but
of the President of the Republic.</p>

<p>The military training of the Guard was zealously fostered, but
the troops did not develop a military spirit. The people&rsquo;s
Guards in the barracks remained the same Social-Democratic proletarians
as they were outside it, and their interest was occupied, not by
military, but by social questions.</p>

<p>The General Staff has formed two sections; one for education,
and one for agriculture. The former takes care of the continued
education of the guards, the increase both of their civil knowledge and
of their technical capabilities. The other section pursues agricultural
activities, upon some large estates, which are put at its disposal.</p>

<p>The Austrian Popular Militia also contains, an educational
section, but the agricultural section is a special feature of the
Georgian Guard. This undertaking is not to be confused with Russian
compulsory labour. The Georgian organisation signifies the civilising
of militarism, but the Russian organisation is the militarising of
civil work. In the People&rsquo;s Guard, the workers who would
prefer to be outside the army are not subjected to military discipline,
which would compel them to undertake specific work; but soldiers who
would otherwise stay in barracks without occupation are provided with
the opportunity of breaking the monotony of an unproductive existence
by useful and various activities. Only experience can show whether the
Guards can do more productive work on these large estates than as
private workers, but even if this should not be the case, they will
certainly be able to reduce the cost of their maintenance.</p>

<p>The large estates cover a part of the requirements of the
Guards. We have here a very interesting experiment, the extension of
which deserves serious consideration. Its maintenance and successful
accomplishment in Europe might lend a more reasonable and tolerable
aspect to the enormous European armies. It is not a specially
socialistic measure it could be accepted by any middle-class
government, but if this were done, what would become of the military
contractors? How many European Officer Corps would not find employment
in useful work below their dignity?</p>

<p>It is not a Socialistic measure to set to work upon State land
soldiers who are undergoing their period of training, but it might be
of importance for the development of Socialism, as a starting-point for
the establishment of one form of Socialist agriculture.</p>

<p>In spite of their pronounced peaceable disposition and
employment, the People&rsquo;s Guard have shown their readiness for
fight on every occasion that has arisen. Unfortunately, such occasions
have not lacked, as we have seen.</p>

<p>Voluntary armies alone cannot permanently suffice for the
Socialist Republic. The spirit of democracy required participation, in
military service, of all capable of bearing arms, which was equally
reinforced by the necessity for securing the Republic against its
mighty external enemies.</p>

<p>Thus, by the side of the People&rsquo;s Guard, arose the
army of general military service. Its definite shape represents a
militia, similar to the Swiss militia, and is under the control of the
War Minister. In the event of war, the regular army and the volunteer
army are united under the same supreme command. In the general
conscript army, the War Ministry zealously foster educational
activities, and the democratic principle has been widely applied, for
the first time, among these troops. Yet in this case, the officers are
not chosen by the soldiers, but are appointed by the War Ministry. The
majority of the officers are Social-Democrats. As regards the military
feeling of the troops and the relations of the separate sections of the
army, a reasoned judgment cannot be passed by a layman, especially one
who is not familiar with the language, and has not had the opportunity
for a lengthy observation. I was assured, on various sides, that no
jealousy existed between the Guard and the regular Army.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, that until February the whole army had
been entirely successful in its campaigns; the entire army was feeling
a great enthusiasm for the independence of the Fatherland. It suffered
severely from the lack of arms and munitions.</p>
