<h2>Karl Kautsky</h2>

<h1>The Social Revolution</h1>

<hr class="section" />
<h3>Translator&#8217;s Preface</h3>

<p class="fst">The greater part of the first half of this translation was already completed before the numbers of <strong>Justice</strong> containing the translation of J.B. Askew reached us. Hence little use could be made of that work. Some comparisons with the first few pages were made in the proofs, and a few alterations made in accordance with suggestions there received, for which we wish to give due credit. The present translation has also been compared with the French translation of the first part which appeared in <strong>Le Mouvemente Socialiste</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally we wish to extend our thanks to Comrade Kautsky for his kind permission to bring this translation of what we believe to be one of the most important contributions made to Socialist literature during the last decade before American readers.</p>
