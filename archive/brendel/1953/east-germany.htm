<p class="information">The following pages were printed for the first time in Dutch as a 
pamphlet, published anonymously by the <i>Spartacusbond</i>, a Dutch 
council-communist group from which the author was a member at that time. They 
came out only a few weeks after the events as a bitter charge against bolshevist 
state-capitalism, unmasking the clumsy lies of its ruling class and doing 
justice to the thousands and thousands of nameless East-German workers who 
bravely resisted oppression and exploitation In 1978 the pamphlet was re-edited 
by the Dutch group <i>Daad en Gedachte</i> (Act and Thought) with only a few 
negligible modifications: here and there the author preferred a more analytic 
style to the emotional one of his charges of that time. For the rest and 
especially so far as his opinions are concerned there was no need of any change 
at all.</p>

<p class="information">In 1979 a French translation of the second Dutch edition of the 
pamphlet was published by Echanges et Mouvement. This is a literal translation 
from the French, looked over by the author.</p>

<p class="information">Nearly half a century ago the well-known Dutch Marxist Anton 
Pannekoek stated that the masters of Bolshevist Society were nothing but "a 
class that tries to perpetuate the worker' serfdom". The justness of his view 
was proved by those events which form the subject of these chapters:</p>

<p class="information" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">"The wages policy obtaining in East Germany aim to achieve 
increased productivity by intensifying workers' output and lowering wages... 
Methods of payment by result are applied wherever possible ... earnings depend 
firstly on various skill-categories, secondly to the extent to which workers 
fulfill norm, i.e. on the amount of goods produced in a specific time.. By 1950 
there were already enormous differences in earnings in East-Germany.. The 
Russian system that Russian managers were seeking to apply could only lead to 
even greater differences ..." (<b>The Wage system in the Soviet zone</b> in "Der 
Gewerkschafter" ["The Trade Unionist", a West German periodical] from July '53.)</p>

<h3><a name="h1">Introduction</a></h3>

<p class="fst">It is about thirty years since, one summer morning in 1953, 80 to 
100 workers on the building sites in the Stalin Allee<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> of E. Berlin laid down 
their trowels. They came down from the scaffolding and, joined by their 
workmates, moved towards the government buildings in the Leipziger Strasze: they 
went there in order to protest against the increase in work norms</p>

<p class="fst">They were unaware that by this action they were giving the signal 
for a workers insurrection which would spread like a brushfire over all of E. 
Germany. On trio 16th and 17th of June, 1953, the Bolshevik regime of the 
G.D.R.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> was made to tremble. The wage slaves of state capitalism went into 
action even in the remotest Corners of the land. Wherever the spark of 
resistance touched, or one might say electrified them, there spontaneously they 
formed revolutionary councils. They were taking the first steps on a road which 
led not, as has been said, towards bourgeois democracy, but towards the far 
further goal of a working class democracy.</p>

<p class="fst">The insurrection was strictly proletarian in character, 
some-thing rarely seen before in other similar situations. It provided a living 
example to the world of what does and does not constitute a workers revolution. 
And with the same blow, the insurrection radically destroyed any myths on the 
subject<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> that had previously been tenable. What the insurrection in the East 
overthrew was the notion that no revolutionary practice is possible without a 
revolutionary theory<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a>.</p>

<p class="fst">What's more, it showed that the existence of a "vanguard" is not 
a necessary condition for revolutionary action by the" working-class; that 
instead of revolutionary storm springing from a "revolutionary conscicusnaas'11 
it is the revolutionary storm which gives birth to the "revolutionary 
Consciousness". The events also showed how quickly small groups of workers, 
fighting over their work condition, can transform themselves into masses 
struggling for very much wider and more radical objectives. The Hungarian 
Revolution, 3 years later, was to demonstrate with what enormous rapidity the 
masses will change their demands in a similar revolutionary process, and how 
speedily their slogans will change from one moment to the next. We learn that 
it's not what workers think about their own actions that is important in the 
class struggle, but what those actions mean, and how the momentum of events 
shapes the way workers behave.</p>

<p class="fst">Young people of today do not always have a clear conception of 
what has happened in the past. It must be added, too, that history has been 
modified by the West<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a>. The pages which follow represent an effort to 
reconstruct this past. We have based ourselves on several publications, the 
value of which lie's, above all, in the testimonies of those who were present at 
the centre of events.</p>

<h3><a name="h2">A Storm Blows Up</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In the summer of 1953, the Eastern Zone of Germany, occupied by 
Russian troops, was the scene of very important revolutionary events. For the 
first time in 32 years there was sizeable movement taking place amongst the 
proletariat on German soil. In E. Berlin, Magdeburg, Rostock and "Warnemunde, 
Brandeburg and Rathenow, in Dresden and in Gorlitz on the Polish frontier, at 
lena; in the uranium-producing region of Aue, in Halle and in Leipsic, in 
Bitterfeld, Merseburg, Wolfen and in many other towns In the lignite basin of 
central Germany, workers left their factories all at the same moment and went 
out onto the streets.</p>

<p class="fst">It was started by the building workers. They were followed by 
considerable mass of the metal workers. Work stopped at the steel works of 
Henningsdorf, in the Bergmann-Borsig factory, in the foundries of Calbe and 
Furstenberg, in the Zeiss works, in the BMW motor works at Gera, in the Max 
foundries at Unterwellenborn, in the munitions factories of Schonebeck, and in 
the Olympia works at Erfurt, to cite only a few examples: work stopped 
everywhere.</p>

<p class="fst">For a brief moment, the workers could see power within their 
grasp. The Grotewonl-Ulbricht government, mere puppetry in the hands or the 
Russians, was in a state of total panic. It lost all initiative and lost its 
capacity to act. The existing regime gave way under the irresistible pressure of 
the masses.</p>

<p class="fst">In main streets and squares throughout the country assembled 
large crowds of workers who were all of a sudden aware that they had nothing to 
loose but their chains. In 1918, on the morning of the 9th of November, the 
insurgent sailors of Kiel entered a Berlin which was bubbling over; on the 17th 
of June 1953, the same Berlin was visited by the steelworkers of Henningsdorf. 
But there was this great difference: when the sailors of Kiel came down the 
Charlottenburg road, they came in small separated groups and had lost their 
cohesion. The workers of Henningsdorf stuck together and there were 12,000 of 
them.</p>

<p class="fst">They marched arm in arm on a wide front. They came down the road 
which led from the north, still wearing their work clothes, and with their 
protective spectacles still hanging around their necks. They crossed through the 
French sector after cutting the barbed wire barriers. Some wore shoes with 
wooden soles which echoed on the paving stones. The sound was amplified against 
the buildings of Millerstasze at Wassing, till it became an approaching storm 
which could sweep the Bolsh leadership clean out of the political scene.</p>

<p class="fst">It was pouring with rain when the workers of Henningsdorf left 
their factories. Soon they were completely soaked. But nothing could have held 
them back<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a>. There were women amongst them wearing light shoes bought from the 
shop of the Organization of Commerce in shoes, which weren't meant for heavy use 
like this. When their feet began to hurt, the women took off their shoes arid 
continued barefoot at no price were they going to be left behind, They were 
pushed for-ward by a common. desire and a common purpose. All had but one aim; 
get to Berlin. They had to cover a distance of 20 kilometers (about 12.5 miles), 
and that was only going. Not one gave a thought to the return. And as for the 
consequences of their action, no one had any precise idea of that.</p>

<p class="fst">Everything was happening in a way once described by Henrietta 
Roland Holst: "the revolutionary spirit can carry individuals away only at the 
moment when logical judgment or the Consequences of their acts has more or less 
disappeared from their consciousness"<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a>. So it was with the Henningsdorf 
workers. And so it was also for the many E. German workers who had started to 
act before them.</p>

<p class="fst">On the 16th of June for instance9 a procession of around 10,000 
people passed by the front of the police headquarters of E. Berlin at 
Alexanderplatz. Behind the windows of the eight story building, officers touched 
fingers to, foreheads1 - it was just a few loonies. In a cafe on the 
Greifwalderstrasze, three workers were playing cards. Their first reaction on 
seeing the procession was also to say "they're mad". But for the masses once 
aroused, everything develops along different lines than for those individuals 
who possibly never will.</p>

<p class="fst">"Mad" is certainly what all those who rose up in E. Germany must 
have seemed in the eyes of those who took stock of the enormous power of the 
State and of the party which is why the bourgeois press of the West have always 
considered that what actually happened in E. Germany, in summer of 1953~ was 
impossible It was a most widespread belier that mass movements were impossible 
under a system like Bolshevism. Two German historians had expressed this opinion 
during the very week the insurrection broke out. Along with many others who 
thought the same way, they shared the firm conviction that the masses lack 
sufficient audacity to resist the Bolsh regime. Such resistance was held to be 
both improbable and unbelievable. Nevertheless, both the improbable and the 
unbelievable were happening.</p>

<p class="fst">Rosa Luxemburg had already stated that "the masses can become 
completely other than their appearance would suggest and can always advance in a 
manner which corresponds with historical circumstances. With the masses, there 
is a whole Series of possibilities. Today, they may appear indifferent and 
apathetic, tomorrow they might rise up with the greatest show of audacity. So we 
shouldn't make judgments based on their mood of the moment, but must take the 
basis of social development into consideration"<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a>.</p>

<p class="fst">The struggle against oppression and exploitation and against the 
working class condition is part of the development of capitalist relations. The 
moment that this struggle takes on the character of an insurrection or 
revolution, this law of social development surges to the fore and remorselessly 
sweeps away any myths and illusions myths and illusions existing everywhere, 
even today. So it was in June, 1953.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">A Spontaneous Movement</a></h3>

<p class="fst">It is fairly widely believed that a proletarian revolution cannot 
be realized without the prior creation of powerful organization which will put a 
firm leadership at it's head to formulate the slogans and point out the way. 
Only this organization and that leadership can stimulate the masses and lead 
then to any real resistance. Thus, a political vanguard would be the 
indispensable prerequisite for the decisive struggle which alone can break the 
power of the ruling-class. In the past, this concept has largely been destroyed 
by historical reality and the workers' insurrection in E. Germany in 1953 has 
once again consigned this conception to the kingdom</p>

<p class="fst">fables. The masses started moving without the tiniest bit of 
stimulation from any organization. It could hardly, in fact, have been 
otherwise. No organization which could fulfill this "historic task" existed in 
the State of Ulbricht and Gortewohl under the dictatorship of the one solo 
party, the S.E.D. Slogans and resolutions which might have told the worker.': 
"what was to be done" were simply non-existent. There wasn't a trace of anything 
resembling a leadership from above or from outside, and for good reason<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a>.</p>

<p class="fst">After the struggle, a worker at the Agfa film factory at Wolfen 
near Bitterfeid declared. "It wasn't planned at all, everything happened 
spontaneously. Workers from nearby factories didn't know what was happening in 
our factory until the moment we found ourselves in the street".</p>

<p class="fst">A Berliner who marched in a demonstration right across the 
capital describes his experience accordingly: "We reached the Lustgarten, the 
destination of our march, and no one could say what we ought to do next". And 
Dresdeners said, "We wanted to demonstrate in the Square of the Theatre. We 
didn't think up any other practical action. It was like being drunk for the 
first time. We had forgotten the most simple and urgent things".</p>

<p class="fst">That, too, is what a worker from a factory somewhere in the 
Russian zone by Berlin had to say: "It was disastrous that there were no 
Organization, or anything like that In our area, we were all people who had 
never gone on strike before It was all improvised. We had no linkups with any 
other towns or factories. We didn't know where to begin. But we were totally 
full of joy that things were happening as they were" All you saw in the crowd 
was faces beaming With emotion because everyone was feeling at last the hour has 
come, we're freeing ourselves from the yoke of' slavery". An eyewitness from 
Halbertstad, declared: "Every action was characterized by spontaneity - if that 
hadn't been the case it would all have worked out"</p>

<p class="fst">One of the first people to have written on the events of that 
summer concluded that "actions which took the form of a general strike actually 
developed without coordination and in a totally different way from what would 
have been the case if it had been a Strike called by the T.U. movement. The 
existing unions were dominated by Supporters o£ the system whose interest was 
only in serving those of the State. This explains the fact that the initiative 
was taken in several different places at the same time, in the houses of 
hundreds and thousands of workers who, as they listened to the radio on the 16th 
of June learnt of what the building workers of Berlin had done"<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a>. Further on, 
the same author maintains that "from 7.00 AM on June 18th the concern was 
spreading throughout the Eastern zone without any communication at that time 
between the towns and villages"<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Other historians writing later have but confirmed this initial 
statement</p>

<p class="fst">All those who participated in the events, and all the 
eyewitnesses who reported the events are agreed on this point: that the 
insurrection (uprising) in Berlin in June 1953 has to be characterized in no 
other way than as a spontaneous movement of' the working-class.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">Bolshevik Lies</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The development of the mass movement in E. Germany delivered a 
death blow to all such theories, like the Bolshevik one which attempted to 
establish the need for a professional revolutionary party as the prerequisite 
for the proletarian revolution. As was to be expected the Bolsheviks of E. 
Germany tried hard to defend themselves against this blow which the workers had 
dealt them. After thinking about it for 48 hours, they claimed there had been no 
question of a class struggle, but of ... "a plot hatched well in advance" and of 
"the terror unleashed by Adenauar, Ollenhaur, Kaiser, and Reuter<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> in person" 
and of the action of "thousands of foreign, fascist, agent-provocateurs" who 
"failed thanks to the good sense of the workers of Berlin".</p>

<p class="fst">Their lies were outrageous and endless. In their own daily paper, 
the S.E.D.'s Neue Deutschland, in the issue of June 17,1953, the rulers of E. 
Germany were forced to concede that the workers who had gone on strike on June 
16 had "carefully kept their distance from agent-provocateurs and trouble making 
elements". Later, they completely ignored the fact that the June insurrection 
had not fallen out of the sky, but was the outcome of a movement which had been 
broadening itself throughout the previous months; this was passed over in utter 
silence. Some weeks before the 16th and 17th, some strikes had broken out at 
Eisleben, Finsterwalde, Furstenwalde, Chemnitz-Borna and other towns. During 
these strikes appeared the same demands which were later to be made during the 
course of the uprising in June. The Bolsheviks had never maintained that these 
previous strikes were 'instigated' by provocateurs. All the same, the relation 
of these strikes to the movement which was unleashed later on in obvious as is 
this evidence itself; which alone destroys all the incredible myths about a 
supposed day 'X' on which an attack on the R.D.A is alleged to have taken place.</p>

<p class="fst">According to the Bolsheviks, "95% of the demonstrations in E. 
Germany had come from the western sector". That would mean that on the 16th of 
June 1953, several hundreds of thousand s of people, given the number of 
demonstrators, had passed across the control points at the borders of both East 
and West Berlin. A completely ridiculous statement, which wasn't taken seriously 
even by the bureaucrats themselves, to go by the impressive number of arrests 
which followed both in the factories of E. Berlin and in the popular districts 
of E. Berlin. And this despite the fact that their own newspaper, Neue 
Deutschland, had written the day before the arrests, that it was the working 
class districts of E. Berlin, in particular, that there lived the "intelligent 
workers who would not allow themselves to be provoked".</p>

<p class="fst">If the Bolsheviks want to go on claiming that the demonstrators 
came from the western sectors of Berlin, then they're forced to admit that 
they've arrested innocent people from the various districts of E. Berlin, and 
that they've sentenced innocent people to long terms of imprisonment and even to 
death. If, on the other hand, they maintain that those people serving sentences 
are 'guilty'. Then little remains out of all their allegations about the origins 
of the demonstrators.</p>

<p class="fst">So what was the actual crime for which those people were 
imprisoned or shot? Even the E. German newspaper Vorwärts wrote on the 22nd 
June, and Neue Deutschland on the 23rd that on the building sites on the Stalin 
Allee where almost all the workers were S.E.D. members, and at the cable factory 
in Kopenick as well as in Leipsic region, strike committees, elected by the 
workers had been in operation. Does this mean that the crime with which dozens 
were charged, and for which they were sentenced, was to have elected or to have 
been elected onto a strike committee? That was certainly the actual fact. But 
there was no question of their being overtly charged with it. The ruling class 
of E. Germany couldn't possibly admit that it was harassing workers solely on 
their waging class struggle, and that this fact was a threat to the power of the 
Bolsheviks. And, in spite of the contradictions discussed above, the Bolsheviks 
have stuck to their contemptible interpretation that the uprising had been "the 
work of agents from the west and of provocateurs". The (Eastern) newspaper 
Berliner Zeitung formulated the same interpretation in this way: "The 
agent-provocateurs were wearing cowboy shirts" and thus, without this hardly 
penetrating article even explaining how they were immediately recognizable as 
"agent-provocateurs" because ... they were dressed that way. Maybe because 
nobody had actually seen any of those men disguised as cowboys.</p>

<p class="fst">The daily paper Tagliche Rundschau on June 24th put forward 
another interpretation according to which the "provocateurs" and "western spies 
had disguises themselves" as building workers. But this time they didn't explain 
how the so called spies had been able to get hold of such clothes such as those 
worn by E. German workers (and of the same lousy quality and all!).</p>

<p class="fst">On the 20th of June 1953, someone called Kuba delivered yet a 
third interpretation. He spoke of "hooligans", meaning the type of people who 
"mixed with the working class crowds of E. Berlin and who were immediately 
recognizable by their appearance". In all of these interpretations of the 
events, the Bolsheviks become increasingly entangled in the chain of their own 
lies.</p>

<p class="fst">They had little alternative. They were a long way from believing 
that the action of the masses of the D.D.R. stemmed from the social relations 
themselves and that the regime established by the S.E.D. opened up perspectives 
of a proletarian revolution as does the capitalist order of Europe and the 
U.S.A. The selfsame Kuba, who we have just quoted, told E. German workers: "The 
need to struggle exists only when the reasons for doing so exist, and you don't 
have any such reasons". The idea that the very fact that they were struggling 
demonstrated precisely that they did have reasons for doing so, did not seem to 
occur to him ...!</p>

<p class="fst">There existed this chasm between the E. German ruling class and 
working class. For the ruling class socialism meant piece-work, wages and 
bonuses. To them "the interest of the proletariat" consisted in an exploitation 
more intense than in the west. The resistance of the working class to such a 
situation arose according to the ruling-class out of a "misunderstanding"; a 
misunderstanding that had to be clarified by the Russian Army and the people's 
police, the Volkspolizei.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">The Prelude To The Spring</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The German working class used different forms of struggle in that 
great class uprising of 1953. They used nearly every means of proletarian 
resistance, either one after another, or sometimes several at the same time. 
Strikes, demonstrations, mass factory occupations, replaced and succeeded one 
another, and each occasion showed that one method of struggle was being 
substituted for another as soon as a point had reached where the movement had 
either evolved to a particular level, or had exhausted the possibilities of one 
particular form of action.</p>

<p class="fst">It had all begun very early on in the Spring. On the 16th of 
April, 1953, a hearing took place at the Zeitz Power Station near Halle, which 
had come about as a result of general pressure from all the workers involved in 
the plant<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a>. At this meeting, the sorters were protesting about the 
catastrophic Consequences of the bonus-system. According to an account published 
several weeks later, on Nay 29th, in the Freiheit de Halle" newspaper the 
workers there were mounting in effect a violent attack on the Party itself. As 
quoted in that paper "a worker named Walter got up and said, 'Comrades, what's 
going on now is downright humiliating to the working-class. Karl Marx has been 
dead for 70 years, and here we are still discussing our most basic needs ..." 
And a worker named Meyer sarcastically inquired of the factory official Kahnt, 
how much his own bonus amounted to and how much he had produced for it." On the 
same day that this report appeared in the Freiheit newspaper, the government 
announced an increase in work norms. Also on that day, the "Neues Deutschland" 
gave evidence of a growing concern over what was happening in a factory in 
Leipsic which produced goods for the railways.</p>

<p class="fst">Readers of the Neues Deutschland of June 2, 1953 were informed 
about "hard-hitting discussions" going on amongst the workers of the "peoples" 
foundry, and amongst the workers in the machine tool factory in 
Berlin-Lichtenberg, where a machinist, Adolf Schermer, and many others had 
reacted violently against the augmentation of work norms.</p>

<p class="fst">On June 7th, the party leadership in Magdeburg was criticized in 
the Neues Deutschland" editorial for not apparently having been able to cope 
with the turn the situation had taken in the course of the "violent discussions 
that had gone on in the workshops".</p>

<p class="fst">In Magdeburg, as in several other towns such as Wilhemsruh and 
Lena, workers went further. At Rosslau, for example, they not only demonstrated 
their revolt against the increase in their workload but also openly criticized 
the entire policy of the Party and of the government. In other towns, some of 
which have been mentioned in previous chapters, work stopped altogether.</p>

<p class="fst">At first there were demonstration discussions, then discussions 
linked with political protest, and then strike action, like climbing one by one 
the first three steps of the staircase. In all these strikes of the spring 1953, 
the number of workers involved in each action was always small. In every 
instance the strikes were of short duration, neither were they unleashed at the 
same time. But behind all these movements, for one thing, all bore witness to 
their being the diverse elements of a far larger movement, and for another it 
was the frequency with which they broke out; one movement here, the next 
elsewhere, one after the other right across the country. Tension was mounting 
all the time. During the course of a party branch meeting in the Druckhaus 
(printing press) at Leipsic, someone named Zaunert had categorized all against 
the case for augmentation of norms as "idiots who did nothing more than give 
orders". Another speaker named Raulan declared that "if a genuine election were 
held, the party wouldn't get anywhere at all"<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a>. On the 28th of May, the 
carpenters at the workshop G-north in the Stalin-Allee in E. Berlin went on 
strike. Neues Deutschland reported it on the 14th of June. Two editors of the 
paper recounted how one brigadier-roche had referred to the augmentation of 
norms as a "direct blackmail". They also said that the workers had at that time 
been complaining for some months that what they received inside their wage 
packets didn't tally at all with what was written on the outside. Four days 
before the uprising, on the 12th June, there was anew strike in Stalin Allee, 
this time in workshop C-south. This one was the workers immediate answer to a 
letter announcing that norms had been augmented by 10%, retroactive to the 1st 
of June. The strikers refused to return to work until these measures were 
annulled.</p>

<p class="fst">At about 2:30 p.m., 15 officials appeared on the scene, 
comprising of members of the party, the Bolshevik Trade Union and the workshop 
management. They mingled with the workers and tried to calm them down. But they 
came out with what the workers called "the same old stories": "You've just got 
to wait, because as soon as you're working a bit harder our life will improve 
because production will have gone up. You won't be falling behind If you're 
working harder because everything will become cheaper ..." "we've been hearing 
rubbish like this for 5 years and we're still getting less to eat" answered one 
worker. Another took up the point: "you've got fat enough bellies, but take a 
look at ours. You don't take home 144 marks, you get 1200."<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a>.</p>

<p class="fst">A union official A union official took it upon himself to 
explain, "There's no such thing as a strike in a people's factory, which is your 
own property. If you strike you're striking against yourselves." This led one 
worker to reply, "we're not striking for our own pleasure and we know exactly 
what you're doing." So the official tried another tact: "If you want to go on 
strike today, Okay, but you must advise your Trade Union." The workers let him 
understand in no uncertain terms their strike had nothing to do with the trade

<h3><a name="h6">Not Only The Stalin Allee But The Whole Of All Berlin</a></h3>

<p class="fst">This conflict which was welling up in workshop C-south on the 
Stalin Allee on June 12 resembled in every respect those of the pre-ceding 
weeks. However in, in the early hours of the morning of the16th June, the 
movement entered a new phase. Up until that point, the various dispersed actions 
which comprised it, had failed to achieve any concrete results. The workers of 
Block 40 who stopped work that Tuesday realized that their strength lay in their 
numbers, that they had to appeal to other comrades and that extending their 
struggle had become a necessity. And for this reason their resistance took a 
completely different form.</p>

<p class="fst">Very early that morning a representative of the management 
appeared in the workshops; he repeated, "work harder, to start with, then later 
you'll be able to lead more human existence". It was the straw which broke the 
camels back. No sooner had the workers mounted the scaffolds than they came back 
down again. An eyewitness relates "I was climbing up a ladder with 15 mates from 
our section - 'Listen, d'you agree with what's going on?' - The first man was 
already laying down his trowel. A few seconds later the ladders were swaying 
beneath the weight of the workers descending in masses, letting their tools drop 
simply to the ground as they came. Our numbers had suddenly grown by another 
hundred."</p>

<p class="fst">The movement was progressing irresistibly. The effect of this 
small, isolated strike developing into a widespread action was enormous, but it 
had the further effect of changing the character of the action itself. The 
demonstration which in so short a time was growing out of the strike was itself 
turning into a demonstration of the masses. And very quickly, the first slogans 
were shouted by the crowd, the first mass slogans: "We are workers not slaves".</p>

<p class="fst">Towards 11a.m, the crowd was approaching Alexanderplatz. The 
demonstrations had already to a massive 10,000 men and women. Alexanderplatz is 
a large square. Once there, the crowd became aware how many they were. This made 
them feel that nothing could overcome them. One participant said afterwards: "By 
that time we had already become a single united entity. I mean an entity which 
was conscious of its power". The workers could see with their owns eyes the 
Volkspolizei pigs beating a hasty retreat before them. This reinforced the sense 
of their own power; and they reacted by hurling slogans: "Down with the 
government. Down with the Volkspolizei. We demand the reduction of work norms".</p>

<p class="fst">After Alexanderplatz the demonstrators entered the wide avenue of 
Unter den Linden. You could have crossed it by stepping over Heads! By the time 
first marcher were entering Wilhelmstrasze, the augmentation of norms was quite 
forgotten, and the chant was; "We don1t want to be slaves. anymore, we want to 
be free". Suddenly, one single thought filled all hearts and minds.</p>

<p class="fst">The effect of this mass demonstration was the same as is always 
produced by all mass demonstrations. With one action it unified the different 
sections of the working-class into a coherent entity, It demonstrated to the 
workers themselves, as well a." to their enemies the very foundations of working 
class power: their numbers, and their common fate.</p>

<p class="fst">Henrietta Roland Holst, whom we have already quoted above, has 
described phenomenon: "Demonstration transform individuals into an active crowd, 
which is amazing, and which enthusiastically confirms to itself it's own 
strength and it's own audacity. It's thus which explains that self-confident 
participation; each individual seeming to experience the strength of the mass 
enhancing his or her own power"<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a>. This is exactly what happened on one 16th 
in E. Berlin. The crowd was transformed into a mass. They were more than 20,000 
when they besieged the government building in the Leipzigerstrasze at 1 in the 
afternoon.</p>

<p class="fst">They yelled, "Down with Ulbricht and Grotewohl". The 2 ministers 
dared not show themselves. Two of their colleagues, Selbmann and Rau, appeared 
instead, but the sight of them failed to appease the crowd: "we want to see 
Ulbricht and Grotewohl. We're the one who decide who we wart to Listen to".</p>

<p class="fst">At 2:30, Selbmann stood up on a small table that someone had 
brought outside. "Dear colleagues", he began. Immeditately9 the crowd 
interrupted him: "You're not our colleague, you're a shit and a traitor", 
Nonetheless, Selbmann tried once more to have himself heard. He admitted that 
the augmentation of work norms had been a bad decision, and announced that they 
were going to annul it. But he spoke in vain. Such a promise made no sense. It 
might have had some effect that morning; in the afternoon it provoked only 
laughter and anger. A Mason knocked Selbmann off the table with one blow of his 
hand and mounted it himself. From the crowd came shouts of approval. The mason 
spoke: "We' re not in the least interested in what you have to say. We no longer 
wish to be your slaves. we' re opposed to more than the work norms, and we don't 
all come from Stalin Allee. We are all of Berlin.</p>

<p class="fst">There wasn't one unnecessary word in all of that. What had begun 
as a demonstration by the workers of one enterprise had turned into the 
resistance of an active city. At 4.p.m government cars with loudspeakers were 
all over the town. The authorities made it known that they were annulling the 
augmentation of work norms; but with no effect. There was nothing left of their 
authority. On the Rosentalerplatz, official cars were turned over. The slogan 
"General Strike" flew from mouth to mouth, which filled the air.</p>

<p class="fst">By 5 p.m. people had begun to attack party officials before the 
very eyes of the helpless police. In the early hours of the evening the crowd 
was chanting "Down with the S.E.D." A little later they were tearing Bolshevik 
notices off the walls. In front of Barnimstrasze womens prison they called for 
the immediate liberation of the prisoners. By 10 o'clock revolutionary fever had 
swept through the entire population of E. Berlin. The night shift on machine 
making; the big factories failed to turn up for work.</p>

<p class="fst">An eyewitness to the events which took place on Leipzigstrasze 
told how the workers were taken by surprise by their own audacity. "when I went 
home on the night of the 16th June, I had but a single thought, I hope we'll be 
strong enough tomorrow and I hope everyone will be part of the movement. During 
the night of the 16th and 17th of June it became clear it became clear that we 
had to fight no matter what the consequences, and that we had to fight until the 
end. The 16th of June had transformed us all".</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h7">The Revolutionary Tide</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The 16th of June changed everything and everyone. The 17th 
brought even more changes. This was because the mass demonstration coincided 
with the mass strikes, and therefore the interaction of these two forms of 
proletarian struggle rapidly provoked chain reaction. Because the workers had 
experienced their power as a class, they began to act as a class. Because they 
began to act as a class, the sense of their power grew stronger.</p>

<p class="fst">To be able to demonstrate you just have to stop work. Then 
wherever the workers demonstrated, they headed first for the factories were more 
hesitant comrades had not yet joined the struggle. Strikers became 
demonstrators, and demonstrators stimulated strike activity. The workers could 
sense that their unity was a fact. To prevent it being smashed, to prevent the 
continuation of their struggle and, at the same time, the very struggle itself 
being smashed, they had each moment to take steps, each one of which took the 
global struggle a pace further and elevated it to a higher level.</p>

<p class="fst">All over E. Germany, workers were forming their own strike 
committees to run their affairs in factories, in whole towns and entire 
industrial regions. So power was in fact continually shifting. Organisations 
which had been formed during and for the struggle were steadily gaining 
authority. The power of the Party and the Government was fading away as the 
country slipped out of the grip of all these institutions that had previously 
existed. To the extent that the workers were increasingly governing themselves, 
so were these institutions losing their governmental functions. The strike 
committees took on the character of workers' councils, not only in practical but 
also in the formal sense. So an organization was born significantly, not formed 
with the express aim of overthrowing the social order, but on the contrary, 
evolving out of a revolutionary process. The mass strikes as a whole take on the 
character of a general strike, it is the quantity which alters their quality.</p>

<p class="fst">This qualitative change was also apparent, as is change in 
consciousness. At first they were striking to abolish work norms, without any 
thought of bringing down the government. During discussions at the central 
hydraulic station in Zeitz on April16th, a worker named Engelhardt shouted "We 
just want to live like human beings, that's what we want". But the moment all 
the factories had come to a halt, it had become another situation. They were 
demanding the downfall of the regime in order to be able to live like human 
beings. What they were actually doing was transforming social relations AT first 
they were shouting "Down with the augmentation of norms"; a little later the 
slogan was "Down with Walter Ulbricht". This is what characterized the 
revolutionary process.</p>

<p class="fst">No organization had made the revolution; it was the revolution 
which had created its' own organisation. No revolutionary consciousness had 
precipitated the revolution: the revolution had given rise to a new 
revolutionary consciousness. They were interlinked. The new organizations, 
non-existent before, seemed to have sprung up by magic. In reality they sprang 
up due to the initiative of quite unknown activists pushed forward by the masses 
whose very actions amazed even themselves. Caught up in the sudden excitement of 
events they were swept forward, until, in the social turmoil, the consciousness 
of all had been transformed. On the other hand this transformation was 
enormously stimulated by the forming of the new organizations; and there are 
numerous examples of this.</p>

<p class="fst">In the town of Gorlitz on the Neisse, on June 17th, the rebelling 
crowd seized loudspeaker installations in the town. The first speakers came 
forward: immediately 20 00 people were listening. The sound was poor. In spite 
of this they spoke one after another: workers from Lowa, the big coachwagon 
factory, workers from other factories, artisans, a café owner, and an architect, 
white-collar workers, then more workers. Most of them had never been in front of 
a microphone in their lifes, but their enthusiasm and joy at being part of 
events like these helped them overcome any nerves. They were addressing 
thousands, and speak they did.</p>

<p class="fst">In Magdeburg on the evening of June 16th, the musician 'K', a man 
never before involved in politics, performed Johann Strauss' 'Die Fledermaus' in 
frock coat and tails before a full house, little aware that next day he would be 
leading the workers demonstrations in that industrial town, and forced to flee 
to W. Berlin on that account.</p>

<p class="fst">A certain Richard S., inhabitant of the town of Dresden and 34 
years of age, led strikers (demonstrators) in that town from one factory to 
another appealing to the workers to join the action. He went into the main 
workshop in each factory, jumped onto a lathe and gesticulated until the 
machines were turned off and the driving belts disconnected. Then he'd begin to 
speak. "Have you heard the news from Stalin Allee? We've got to support them. 
Come out! Onto the streets". He and two others formed a revolutionary committee. 
They stopped passing lorries and persuaded drivers to turn around and join in 
the action. In no time, they had a motorized division at their disposal which by 
11:00 a.m. had already transported some 15,000 workers. Later S was to say "I 
felt as if I had been reborn. I sent 50 cyclists to occupy the radio station 
..."</p>

<p class="fst">That was an attempt which failed in Dresden but succeeded in 
Halle. The local radio station was occupied by 30 rebelling workers who made 
sure that communiqués issued by the central organization of the strike reached 
the largest numbers. Like an avalanche did the Events of the 17th June,1953, 
gain momentum. The day had hardly began when workers entered battle throughout 
all the towns and villages of E. Germany and in virtually every factory. As in 
E. Berlin, it began with strikes and demonstrations. A few hours later, people 
were disarming the police. They surrounded Party HQs, tore up S.E.D. propaganda 
literature, invaded the prisons and freed the inmates. But only after these 
demonstrations of popular fury did the spontaneous insurrection begin to take on 
more obvious characteristics of proletarian revolution. It's no coincidence that 
this process was more clearly to be seen in the most industrialized parts of E. 
Germany, which also contained the greatest concentration of working class 
people. It is where the coal seams are to be found; and thus was where the first 
flames were kindled. In Halle, Wolfen, Marseburg, Bitterfeld, Rosslau, Gere and 
in other towns in that region, organizations sprung up which for a short while 
took executive power into their own hands. They set up a new structure which was 
neither Bourgeois nor statist: a structure conceived for the express and single 
purpose of creating real liberty for the working people.</p>

<p class="fst">At 1:30, there was a meeting in a factory in Halle of 
representatives from the strike committees of nearly every factory in the town. 
They elected a council which they called "initiative committee" but a closer 
look reveals it was and in every way functioned more like a workers council. It 
proclaimed a general strike, took the decision to occupy the offices of a local 
newspaper in order to produce a manifest; and the workers were actually engaged 
in this activity when they were stabbed in the back by police informers and 
forced to stop.</p>

<p class="fst">No need to ask which class was on the move to Halle. From early 
morning columns of workers poured in from the metallurgical factories on the 
outskirts of the town, intent on marching to the center, just as the workers 
from Henningsdorf had invaded E. Berlin. A crowd of over 50,000 demonstrators 
assembled in the market square in Halle.</p>

<p class="fst">Similar events took place in Marseburg: 200,000 workers marched 
on Uhland square in the town center, from the Leuna factories<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> and had 
brought with them workers from the Buna works at Schkopau, from the Gros Keyna 
coal mine's, from the Geisel Valley oil fields and from three other factories. 
The strike organizer convinced that the workers greatest power lay in their 
workplaces, that were advising demonstrators to go back and fight for their 
demands in their own factories. The kind of demands they were making were 
clearly evident from earlier on in that day. The entire personnel of the Leuna 
works had assembled outside the management building. One of the accounts 
demanded amongst other points was that end be put to the incessant speeding up 
of work rhythms and that the factory police be immediately disarmed. Workers 
occupied the factory radio post.</p>

<p class="fst">The scenes which occurred in Bitterfeld on the afternoon of June 
17th were such as never had been witnessed before. Workers in overalls from 
every factory on the outskirts of town advanced on a wide front. Miners still 
black with coaldust amongst them. The whole town was in festive mood. The 
President of the strike committee got up to speak in the Square of the Youth. He 
was still speaking when word came that the police had arrested several workers. 
On hearing this, the strike committee immediately decided to occupy the town. At 
this point, the strike committee started functioning as a workers council 
wielding the executive power in Berlin. Public employees were to carry on 
working: firemen received orders to remove all S.E.D. notices in the town; whilst 
the strike committees, at the same time, prepared for a general strike, not only 
in their town and the surrounding area, but throughout the whole of E. Germany. 
In a telegram to the so-called government of the G.D.R in E. Berlin, the 
Bitterfeld striking committee demanded the "formation of a provisional 
government composed of revolutionary workers".</p>

<p class="fst">At Rosslau on the Elbe the workers similarly took over the town 
for a while. The kernel of the resistance there was the workforce of the naval 
shipyards.</p>

<p class="fst">In every factory and town of significant size or importance, 
events paralleled the situation in the country's vital center. In Dresden, 
workers from all the big factories, including Zeiss, were on strike and 
demonstrating. Embattled workers in the province of Brandenburg transportation 
works, the Elizabeth coalfield and the Kirchmoser coach building works (under 
Russian management). Work came to a halt in every single factory in Falkensee, a 
in Leipsic, Frankfort, and the Oder, Furstenburg, Greifswalde and Gotha, not to 
mention the towns were workers had come out onto the streets. Even the Uranium 
mines on the Czech border were on strike; as was even the northern part of the 
country with the least dense concentration of population.</p>

<p class="fst">None of this however, prevented the Neues Deutschland a month 
later, July 28th, from proclaiming that the strike had been organized by 
'putschistes' who failed because the majority of the workers had refused to 
listen to them and that a mere 5% of the working class had come out on strike. 
The reality was that the Bolshevik ruling class had to confront resistance from 
an entire oppressed class.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h8">Neither Ulbricht Nor Adenaur</a></h3>

<p class="fst">When the augmentation of work norms was announced by the S.E.D. in 
the spring 1953, a section of the E. German working class had hoped to 
'neutralise' its effects by moving into a higher income bracket, a hope which 
was soon, however, to prove quite worthless. The Neues Deutschland wrote that 
such a demand ran completely contrary to the workers own interest: but the 
workers had quite different ideas as to their own interests. They did some rapid 
sums and discovered that a worker earning 20-24 E. German Marks per day would 
only bring home 13-16 Marks after the establishment of the new work norms; which 
they refused to accept. It was a revolt on such a brutal attack on their 
standard of living, not a stand for political aims or revolutionary ideals. The 
workers embarked on a struggle against the governments wages policy, which 
developed into a struggle against the government as such; but this was through 
no initial intention on the workers part: it developed this way from the nature 
of the struggle itself and it's class character. It was this class character 
which guided the workers action and which played a decisive role in the content 
and form of their movement.</p>

<p class="fst">This class character has been largely ignored by both East and 
West, and for the same reasons. Acknowledgement of it by the Bolsheviks would 
have meant renunciation of all the myths surrounding their own society; while 
the bourgeois democracies saw nothing whatsoever to be gained from underlying 
any social significance which might trigger off repercussions amongst workers in 
the west. So political leaders in the F.G.R. referred to it as a popular uprising 
against the Russian occupying force, and were more readily able to back up an 
interpretation favorable to the ruling class by giving major importance to 
events which had been happening over on the fringes of the movement. So, too, 
was the ruling class in the west able to refer to it as a "struggle for German 
unity".</p>

<p class="fst">During a sober demonstration in Rudolf Wilder square in 
Shconeberg district of W. Berlin in June 1923, Chancellor Adenaur declared 
"members of the German Nation living behind the Iron Curtain have made us aware 
we must not forget them ... I declare before the entire German nation that we 
shall not rest as long as they remain unfree, and until the whole of Germany is 
reunited". And the mayor Reuter added "No power in the world can divide the 
German people. The youth tore down the flag of servitude in Brandenburger Place: 
the day will come then that same youth will plant in its place the flag of 
liberty ..."</p>

<p class="fst">It's true that on June 10th some young people had pulled the 
D.D.R. flag down from that historic gate and had then tried to replace it by the 
F.G.R. flag. It is also true that one of the chants on several occasions had been 
"Freedom! Freedom!" and that some of sections of the marches had brandished the 
flag of the Bonn government. But all that proves is that some of the 
participants in the movement had no clear idea of why they were doing what they 
were doing. If the workers only gradually became aware of the significance of 
their actions, then it must certainly be that not all of them became aware at 
the same time.</p>

<p class="fst">The workers of E. Germany made it clear during the course of 
their action that in their view they were against the S.E.D. government not the 
Russian army stationed on E. German territory. And in marked contrast with 
distinction, their attitude of hostility towards the police force and to 
officials of the Party, the workers showed no particular hostility towards the 
army until right at the end, when that army openly participated in the 
struggles.</p>

<p class="fst">If one asked whether all the E. German workers saw their action 
as a class movement the answer would undoubtedly be negative. But that in no way 
alters the uncontestable fact that what the workers <i>thought</i> about it was 
less important than in the totality of what they <i>did</i>. In spite of the 
F.D.R symbols and the fairly naïve slogans of "Liberty" and "Unity", what is 
certain is that the working class had no desire to live in a unified Germany. 
Magdeburg railway workers painted in huge white letters all over coaches in the 
sorting yard, "Not Ulbricht, not Adenaur, but Ollenjaur". They were saying here 
that they thought of a Social-Democrat like Ollenjaur representing their own 
class, but they were at a Germany governed by either Ulbricht or Adenaur. What 
they were saying here, however confusedly, was that they saw their struggle as 
not just against state capitalism but against capitalism as such, and they had 
no intentions of changing their Bolshevik masters for bourgeois ones.</p>

<p class="fst">German political leaders have made June 18th a national holiday, 
a day of "German unity". This completely ignores that fact that the revolt was 
above all expressing a rejection of the class division, which German workers had 
demonstrated during the course of that day, was their implacable enmity as 
workers to a society based upon class oppression.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h9">Bolshevism Unmasked</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Faced with the spontaneous movement of the E. German workers the 
Ulbricht government was completely paralysed. In several instances the ordinary 
police seemed unsure of themselves, and even where they remained firmly 
supportive of the bureaucrats they seemed far too indecisive. In several towns 
they were so ineffective that their resistance crumbled instantly.</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolshevik bureaucracy was normally licked before the battle 
had even started. The obvious rottenness of the regime began to show through 
from the afternoon of June 16th. None of the more senior ministers had dared 
appear before the furious crowd which massed outside their windows in 
Leipzigstrasze and that same evening saw quite a few leading Party bureaucrats 
packing their bags to leave. At this junctive the streets were already under 
control of the masons, welders, type-setters, and carpenters; Columbushouse and 
Potsdammer Place were not yet burning, that was to happen the next day, but 
certainly all the dreams of the ruling-class had already gone up in smoke. 
Whilst the working-class had not yet seized power it was certain that the 
government no longer possessed it.</p>

<p class="fst">And the German Bolsheviks would never have been able to repossess 
this power without the Russian Amy and Russian tanks. With-out their entering 
the action, in Berlin and many other rebellious towns, if the Russians had not 
gone ahead with a state of siege with mass arrests and with executing quite a 
number of workers, the fall of the regime would indeed have been settled.</p>

<p class="fst">In December 1905, Tsar Nikolass II's Cossacks put down the 
workers uprising - under the command of one General Semjonow, high commissioner 
to the U.S.S.R who put down the E. German uprising in June 1953. Russian 
soldiers fired into the crowd, and workers were crushed under tanks which they 
were trying to oppose unarmed; acts of heroism, which have since inspired fellow 
workers all over the world.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a>.</p>

<p class="fst">Bolshevism once more lost its mask in the summer of 1953. Not 
since the Krondstadt uprising of March 1921 had the contradiction between the 
working class and the dictatorship of the Bolshevik Party been demonstrated as 
sharply and as openly as this. Not since then had so significant a number of 
workers had such blatant experience of the ruthless bolshevism directly 
experience as it blocked their path to freedom.</p>

<p class="fst">Russian tank divisions entered the battle towards the end of the 
afternoon on June 18th, with an impressive display of force; but they failed in 
their immediate task of putting an end to all resistance. At 1p.m the Russian 
Commandant in Berlin, General Major Debrowa, announced a state of siege in the 
city. This was soon extended to cover every town in E. Germany, which still 
failed to end the hostilities. Though the streets of E. Berlin were undoubtedly 
desolated on the 18th, strikes were still going on.</p>

<p class="fst">The struggle for the first time, on that same day, June 18th, 
workers of the Warnemunde laid down their tools. In Dresden, Chermitz, and 
Rostock, the workers in a whole series of 'workers factories' went on strike. 
Civil servants in Potsdam did likewise. A number of towns sustained serious 
damage. All boat traffic on the waterways was brought to a halt.</p>

<p class="fst">In the evening of June 18th, a division of 800 'peoples police' 
occupied the Zwickau and Delsnitz coal mines. The police were confronted by 15,000 miners demanding the release of their arrested comrades. Demonstrations at 
the nearby Leuna factories continued: 300 police took sides with the 
demonstrators and the Russian infantry began shooting, and occupied factory 
buildings. Workers set fire to a section of these buildings shortly afterwards.</p>

<p class="fst">On that same day revolt broke out in the mining area of 
Ertsgebergte which till that point had remained quiet. It's 80,000 miners came 
out on strike, demonstrated, and took by storm, offices. Furious street battles 
were fought with police and with heavily armed Russian troops, in Johanngeorgenstadt, Marienberg, Eibenstock, Falkenstein and Oberschlema.</p>

<p class="fst">By June 19th, the entire mining region was in open insurrection. 
110,000 people were on strike and demonstrating. No fewer than 65 wells in the 
uranium were sabotaged some with explosives and others by flooding. The Russians 
were finding themselves having to deploy more and more strength in this corner 
of the G.D.R than they had had to use in 1945 for the conquest of Berlin<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a>. In 
spite of the wave of arrests and shootings which ensued, the revolt continued. 
When following this on the 21st June came an intensification of the siege, the 
workers responded by lynching a number of police officers. It took then days of 
furious combat for the Russians to regain control.</p>

<p class="fst">Workers were still embattled on the Friday and Saturday, 19th and 
20th of June throughout the rest of Eastern Germany. Warnemunde and Rostock saw 
scenes of violent conflict. In Dessau on the upper Elbe there was no more bread 
to be had in the entire town, but no one dreamed of capitulation. Police 
divisions in Mecklenbug and the Harz refused to fire on workers, and began to 
withdraw. By the end of the week new strikes had begun in several more towns, 
this time in smaller enterprises. Here again, workers immediately formed strike 
committees. It was these committees which announced that they would only return 
to work when the state of siege had been lifted and the soldiers had left the 
factory.</p>

<p class="fst">In the final reckoning, the massed strength of the workers was 
forced to give in to the superior might of the Russian troops. They were driven 
out of their workplaces and machine-gunned in the back. After that the S.E.D. 
bosses got their courage back. They had trembled at what they had seen of 
working class power during the workers act of revenge. After the proletarian 
revolutionary 'high tide', a wave of terror passed over the land.</p>

<p class="fst">The resistance of the workers was caused by the social 
contradictions which were far from abolished. The forces that came to the 
surface during the June uprising couldn't be destroyed, of course, as they were 
embodied in the working class itself and were the result of the production 
process.</p>

<p class="fst">As long as any society is based on wage-labour, a revolt of the 
wage-labourers is the fate to which it is bound; like Damocles sword. The E. 
German workers showed us how we must imagine a proletarian revolution.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n4" href="#fn4">[4]</a> In this way Lenin's words are generally quoted. However, the

there is no practical difference, because to Lenin, revolutionary practice and 
the movement (of professional revolutionists!) are one and the same thing.</p>

reality they compliment each other.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> Amongst other articles accessible in French, we cite the best 
study to have appeared on this subject: "Combats ouvriers sur l'Avenue Stalin", <i>
Les Temps Modernes</i>, Oct 1953., p. 672 et sec., by Benno Sarel This text is 
reprinted in this authors work <i>La classe ouvriere d'Allemagne Orientale</i> 
(Los Editions Ouvrieres). A criticism appeared in <i>I.C.O</i> number 43, Nov, 
1965 (p. 16) of the book by ArnuIf Baring, "The 17th June 1953" (in German, 
Cologne 1965). In a rather romanticized form the end of the book "Berlin" by 
Theodor Plivier contains nil evocation of this period.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a> In the critique of Arnuf Baring's book in I.C.O. (see above) 
it is reported that Ulbrict refused to speak to the strikers, replying that it 
was raining and the demonstration would soon disperse. Gustav Noske, at the 
start of the German Revolution, counted on rain to make the demonstration go 
home (see Noske, "<i>Von Kiel bis Kapp</i>" 1920 n 17)</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n10" href="#fn10">[10]</a> Certain people have endeavoured research into its 
"traditions". Willy Brandt, the social Democratic leader held that the events 
were influenced by the pure working-class tradition of the old unionists and 
political movement (others even saw fit to trace it hack to 1919 and 1921). 
According to Baring (see above), nothing would allow for this kind of 
conclusion, uprisings having occurred as much in districts which elected 
communist deputies during the '30 s as in any others. "In any case, in the 
streets the "tradition" followed by the 'old school' was absent: since the 
Social Democrats of Weimar, then the Nazis, and finally the O.G.P.U., had in 
effect, murdered all of the active members of the working-class." (I.C.O, p' 19)</p>

not to authorize this or that meeting. The green light would be given at the 
very last moment. This was how "the full right to free expression of opinions 
guaranteed by the law" worked, which was later referred to by Kuba in the Neues 
Deutschland.</p>

of November 1956, the German example was followed in Hungary. Workers in 
Budapest, and other Hungarian towns were able to incapacitate Russian tanks with 
Molotov cocktails which they themselves had made.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n20" href="#fn20">[20]</a> The figures were published by Der Monat - in October 1953. In 
addition to the numbers of Russian troops there had been given precise details 
about the precise weaknesses of the Russian forces. It resulted from the fact 
that Russian officers and private soldiers had a definite sympathy with the 
embattled workers. There were certain Russian officers, as well as some German 
Policemen, who faced the firing squad as a result of this sympathy. Others 
managed to flee to the west. The Russian Major Nikita Ronschin was amongst 
these. According to his evidence, at least 18 Russian soldiers were shot.
