<p class="fst">The decision of last Monday&#8217;s meeting of the National Committee to bring the <strong>Militant</strong> out again as a weekly when the Expansion Program Fund reaches the thousand dollar mark, and setting July 1st as the definite date of publication, represents another real advance. The New York branch has already endorsed the decision, and there is no doubt that it will be hailed with enthusiasm by the entire organization and the circle of sympathetic workers who surround it and support it. There is likewise no doubt that the decision will be realized in life on the day set, for the task has been carefully weighed and the ground has been prepared.</p>

<p>The first four months of this year have witnessed an improvement and strengthening of the Communist League all along the line. All this work has gone forward under the sign of political consolidation and a planned program of expansion for the year. One-third of the two thousand dollar fund has already been contributed, and the execution of the program, in sections, has kept an even pace. Two numbers of the English edition of the <strong>International Bulletin</strong> have appeared; field organization work has been started in the Illinois mine fields; preparations for the National Conference &#8211; are nearing completion; and the publishing company has its first book on the press. Now we are ready for the next step &#8211; the Weekly <strong>Militant</strong>. Another push along the whole front and the task will be accomplished.</p>

<p>Our <strong>Militant</strong> is the flag of Communism in America. When its first issue appeared, they looked at the mere handful gathered around it and said the first issue would be the last. But they miscalculated. They did not know the power of the idea behind it. They did not know the resources, in endurance and sacrifice, of stiff-necked conviction. Sixty-eight numbers of our paper bear testimony to their error. The triumphant re-emergence of the <strong>Militant</strong> as a weekly will underscore it once again. The concentration of our forces for this event is the order of the day.</p>
