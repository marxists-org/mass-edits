<p class="fst">The draft of a program published by the Opposition group of the
Proletarian Party gives further confirmation of the progressive
tendency represented by the new group. The document leaves a number
of the most decisive questions unanswered, but In spite of this
limitation &ndash; which is easily understandable in a group that has
only recently taken shape &ndash; the programmatic statement of the
Opposition gives a fairly clear impression of the nature of the
revolt against Proletarian Party leaders who lived too long. in
peace. The faction fight &ndash; or, more correctly, the split &ndash;
in the Keracher organization is a fight of revolutionary workers
against a sterile and conservative clique.</P>
<P>The sections of the program dealing with unemployment and the
trade union question show the strong sides of the opposition as
compared with the Keracher official faction. On both these points, so
vitally connected with the daily work in the class struggle, the
opposition group shows the impulse to break out of the sectarian
passivity, garnished with high-sounding pseudo-Marxist talk, which
has characterized the Proletarian Party from the beginning. The
progressive and revolutionary tendency of the opposition in this
regard is undubitable.</P>
<P>It must be noted however that this characterization applies mainly
to its program on these points as compared to the official policy and
practice. The formulations of the opposition are by no means
adequate, and they are lacking somewhat in theoretical motivation.
From this the danger can arise of an uncritical plunge into &ldquo;mass
work&rdquo; for its own sake and the ending of the whole movement in
a swamp. If this is defended as a necessary reaction to the &ldquo;pure
theory&rdquo; of the Keracher group, it must be remembered that it
was not the preoccupation of the Proletarian Party with theoretical
questions, but the shallowness and falsity of its theories, that
determined its isolation and its futility.</P>
<P>The paramount problem of the American labor movement &ndash; the
prerequisite for its development on the revolutionary path in the
next period &ndash; is the consolidation of a firm cadre of political
vanguard fighters, that is, of revolutionary Marxists. In this task
the clarification of theory takes first place. The specific weight of
even a small group of this character will be far greater, and its
influence on events in a rising wave of class struggles incomparable
more decisive than a hundred amorphous &ldquo;mass movements&rdquo;
which leave aside the fundamental problems for future consideration.</P>
<P>The formation of the cadres of the vanguard need not be contrasted
to the mass movements, but their formation is the condition for the
revolutionary effectiveness of the latter. If the opposition group of
the Proletarian Party sees the thing this way its revolt against the
dead routine of Keracherism can become the starting point for an
important contribution to the Communist movement. We hope for a
fruitful collaboration with them on this line. The best way to begin
this collaboration is to conduct a frank discussion of all the
important questions.</p>
