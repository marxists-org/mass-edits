<p><em>Antoinette Konikow was not a supporter of the Cannon faction, but she was one of the first within the American party to support the views of Trotsky&#8217;s Left Opposition, and she had won a group of five Boston area party members to her views. Summoned to appear before the Political Committee after the expulsion of Cannon, Abern and Shachtman, she wrote a defiant protest letter to Jay Lovestone, which is published below. After reading Konikow&#8217;s letter to the November 2 meeting of the Committee, Lovestone commented that &#8220;it is obvious from her letter that she is the worst kind of a Trotskyite, biologically as well as politically. The sooner that we throw her out the better for the party.&#8221; Konikow, a medical doctor and a pioneer of birth control, was unanimously expelled by the Political Committee. She founded the Independent Communist League, which published her letter in its first </em>Bulletin<em>, dated December 1928. Konikow&#8217;s League merged forces with the expelled Cannon faction to found the Communist League of America in May 1929.</em></p>

<p class="fst">Dear Comrade:</p>
<p>This sudden order to appear Friday noon in New York before the Political Committee is in line with your usual tricky policy. You know well that going to New York from Boston means quite an expense and that leaving my medical practice for several days involves a big financial loss. Why can&#8217;t a local committee consider my case? Because they fear the indignation of the local comrades? Or you are not sure that the local committee would act against me with the desired decision? All you want is to be able to tell the rank and file you offered me a hearing and I refused to avail myself of the opportunity. According to the latest decision of the Comintern we should have full inner party democracy and inner party criticism. Why does this not apply to the Trotsky Opposition? Because a few faked resolutions were forced through our party organization by misrepresentation and terrorism? I did work for Trotsky&#8217;s ideals and tried to arouse sentiment for the Opposition in our party, and I consider I have the full right to do so according to the party&#8217;s stand on inner party democracy. But it is useless to expect your committee to accept this viewpoint, for your leadership would not last long under rules of real democracy in our party. I consider that the party has taken an outrageously wrong standing on the Trotsky situation in Soviet Russia. This stand is a result of the servile submission to the Stalin faction.</p>
<p>It happens that I am one of these comrades of whom comrade Stalin in his answer to the American Trade Union Committee said, &#8220;Real Communists cannot be controlled from Moscow.&#8221; I am willing to submit to discipline if a proposition had been given free discussion where both sides were equally given a chance to express themselves. Otherwise I consider it my right and duty to oppose wrongly imposed discipline.</p>
<p>Your decision about me is already made up and my statement will never reach the comrades until I see to it myself. It is good that you have not the power to take away my livelihood as it is done in Soviet Russia. As to besmirching of my name before the comrades, this is to be expected.</p>
<p>A comrade of thirty-nine years services in the socialist cause.</p>
<p>Dr. A.F. Konikow</p>
