<p><em>Cannon inserted the following statement into the minutes of the Political Committee meeting of 13 June 1928 in response to his nomination as a delegate to the Comintern&#8217;s Sixth World Congress, which was to be held in Moscow from 17 July to 1 September 1928. The delegation elected at the meeting included all the major party faction leaders, including Cannon.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I have been of the opinion that the big campaigns the party is now engaged in, some of which are in a critical condition, make it highly inadvisable for a large delegation of Polcom members to leave for the Congress, and have been of the opinion that I personally would not go, but in view of the fact that practically all of the leading comrades are going there, I think it is necessary also for me to accept the nomination.</p>
