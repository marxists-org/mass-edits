<p class="fst">1. This congress is conceived not as the culmination but rather as the starting point of a new movement to rally a powerful united front of the working class in the struggle for the liberation of Mooney and Billings.</p>

<p class="fst">2. The next steps along this line shall be a series of local and district united front conferences which have the aim of broadening the movement in setting ever wider masses of the working class into motion, drawing in new forces not yet in the united front, and cementing the solidarity of those already participating.</p>

<p class="fst">3. This work shall lead in the next stage of the struggle to a <em>national and international Mooney Day</em>, at which the attention of the working class of the entire world shall be concentrated on the Mooney case.</p>

<p class="fst">4. All the agitation and activity in the next period shall be connected with the perspective of a second national Mooney congress with a goal of at least 10,000 delegates.</p>

<p class="fst">5. The policy for an this work that shall govern the activity of the leading committee on a national scale and an the local organizations is the policy of the united front of workers&#8217; organizations. Only in this way is it possible to unite the masses of workers of varying political opinions and tendencies into a single fighting unity in the interests of Tom Mooney and the cause which he symbolizes. The failure of the leaders of some working-class organizations to participate in the movement up to now, and their persistent attempts to sabotage the struggle, must not in any case lead to an abandonment of the united front policy with respect to their organizations. On the contrary, the leading organs of the Mooney movement must make it clear at every turn that all organizations and their leaders are invited to participate in the movement and that the door is left open to them even if they have previously refused. Only in this way will it be possible to really rally the masses of workers within the various organizations and give them proper ground upon which to fight every attempt of the leadership to sabotage unity.</p>
