<p>[Note by Prometheus Research Library:]
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times', serif"><i>The following unpublished and undated document was written at the behest of Leon Trotsky
during the Fourth Congress of the Communist International (held in Moscow, 5 November-5
December 1922) by Cannon and other American Communists who were struggling against the
maintenance of the dual structure of a clandestine Communist party alongside the legal Workers
Party. It played a crucial role in winning Comintern support for the liquidation of the
underground party. Among the document's signers were delegates Cannon, Max Bedacht and
Arne Swabeck, under the names Cook, Lansing and Marshall. The other signatories have not
been identified, though one of the Young Communist League delegates is probably Martin Abern
who was in Moscow at this time. This is a translation of a German-language copy in the
Theodore Draper Papers, Special Collections Department, Robert W. Woodruff Library, Emory
University. A slightly different English translation was published in </i>Spartacist <i>No. 40 (Summer
1987)</i>.</span></p>

<p>[MIA Editor&#8217;s Note: Cannon refers to this document at the end of an account of their appeal to Trotsky in his letter to Draper, <a href="../letters/win55.htm">&#8220;The &#8216;American Question&#8217; at the Fourth Congress&#8221;</a>:
&#8220;At the end of the discussion, which probably didn&#8217;t last more than an hour as he had specified, Trotsky stated unambiguously that he would support us, and that he was sure Lenin and the other Russian leaders would do the same. He said that if Lenin didn&#8217;t agree, he would try to arrange for us to see him directly. He said he would report the interview to the Russian Central Committee and that the American Commission would soon hear their opinion. At the end of the discussion he asked us to write our position concisely, on &#8216;one sheet of paper&#8212;no more,&#8217; and send it to him for transmission to the Russian leadership.&#8221;]</p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In the United States the objective preconditions for revolution are not yet fully
developed. In addition, the class consciousness of the American workers is still undeveloped;
they have not even risen to the point of undertaking independent political action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>However, there is developing within the trade union movement a rapidly increasing
rebelliousness against the official union bureaucracy and, linked to this, a steadily growing
tendency in favor of a labor party. Our main task at present is to develop these tendencies, to
crystallize and organize them; tactics must be oriented toward making us an integral component
of the labor party when it is founded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The illegality of the Communist Party of America is a major obstacle in its work. In
addition, American workers are still dominated by democratic illusions, so that they grasp
neither the aim nor the reasons for conspiratorial, clandestine organizations. We must therefore
wage a determined struggle for a legal Communist party. A large part of the organized workers
movement will support us in such a struggle. If we win, the party will enjoy the enormous
advantages of legal party organization, at least for a time. But if we lose, the fact of our defeat
will greatly contribute to destroying the democratic illusions of the masses; at the same time they
would come to grasp the necessity of illegal organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>This struggle must be carried out with the legal party that already exists. Every function
which can be carried out openly and legally must be transferred to it; its program must gradually
be strengthened and clarified; the duties of members must be increased and their discipline must
be tightened; all with a view toward the goal of making it a real Communist party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>We are hindered in carrying out these tasks by the fact that the great majority of members
are comrades born abroad, mainly of Russian origin, who judge things not from the standpoint of
the objective conditions prevailing in America, but on the basis of their subjective conceptions,
which are based on events in Europe. This is why they oppose every attempt to realistically
apply the Comintern's tactical guidelines to American conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The simultaneous existence of these two irreconcilable elements in the party is the real
cause of the ineffectiveness and sterility of the American movement. The bitter disputes and
splits which develop in the American party over every fleeting question are merely symptoms of
the more deep-seated sickness in the party. The unity imposed by the Comintern has not resolved
the problem in America, but only aggravated it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>We ask the Comintern for a clear presentation of its guidelines concerning the questions
mentioned above and request, in the event that a new split occurs in the course of realistically
implementing these guidelines in America, that the Comintern not again insist on a mechanical
formula for unity.</span></p>
