Ross Dowson was the leading figure in the development of Canadian Trotskyism from his entry in the movement at age 15 in 1932 until 1989. During these 57 years he devoted his energies and creative force to the building of what became the mainstream Marxist left current in Canada in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1974 he withdrew from the movement he had built for 30 years with a group of comrades to build another, in order to continue and develop their traditional politics.<br /><br />
<br />
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This website documents the rich political heritage both of Ross and the movements he led, starting off with his journal articles. Later, a selection of his voluminous correspondence will be added. </p></td></tr></table>
 
 
 <a name="1"> <h3>Ross Dowson&#8212;Speeches to the LSA</h3>

<p>	When Ross Dowson spoke at public forums of the League for Socialist Action, or to closed sessions of comrades and guests, his urgent and creative style demanded close attention for as long as he spoke. His rapport with his audiences was derived from his desire to communicate and convince, to win us over to his ideas and views, as well, of course, to the actions he saw as necessary for the movement to take. </p>

<h3>Series On Canadian Nationalism</h3>

<p>	Burning issues then, and central to today&#8217;s politics, was this debate within the Canadian Trotskyist movement, which, although it raged out of control in the hands of the new youth leadership&#8212;its arguments on both sides never achieving the luxury of a rational discussion&#8212;is of great value for today. Now at last, after a delay of 35 years, these documents can be read by the public as well as the Left as the issue of Canada-US relations becomes ever more acute. </p>

<p class="toc"><a href="speeches/rdspeechLP6.html"> <strong> Canada-US Relations: A socialist viewpoint&#8221; (Pamphlet, 1968)</strong> </a>:</p>

<p>The first statement by the LSA/LSO on the rising phenomenon described as Canadian nationalist sentiment, dating from 1968. This document formed the majority consensus of opinion in the mainstream Trotskyist movement at that time, but was challenged anew by the new youth leadership by the early 1970s and was to become a major issue in the split of the Forward Group in 1974.</p>

<p class="toc"><a href="newstagecanada-us.html"><strong>The new stage in Canada-US Relations  (Pamphlet, 1973)</strong></a>"</p>

<p>In April 1973 the United Tendency in defending and developing this evaluation of Canadian nationalism, issued the second document <a href="newstagecanada-us.html"><strong>The New Stage in Canada&#8212;U.S. Relations</strong></a> re-published by the Forward Group in 1980.</p>

 <h1>The Movement led by Ross Dowson embraces Women&#8217;s Liberation: </h1>
  <a name="4">
 <h1>The struggle for Choice on Abortion&#8212;the Morgentaler Defence campaign</h1>

<p>The Trotskyist movement in Canada was a leading force in decriminalizing abortion and demanding an end to the jailing and persecution of abortionist Henry Morgentaler. As early as 1961 the Workers&#8217; Vanguard raised the issue of abortion; then followed the publication of the League for Socialist Action pamphlet &#8220;The Status of Women in Canada,&#8221; a submission to the Royal Commission in 1968. The LSA, then recruiting a new generation of young militant feminist women to its ranks, and with the participation of Ross Dowson, launched into a sustained 15-year battle to help win the decriminalization of abortion and to release Morgentaler from jail. The successful strategy is vividly described in the pages of Labor Challenge and Forward; and finally, <a href="LeftCNews/indexleftC.html">Left Caucus Newsletter</a>. The movement&#8217;s press in Quebec also led an effective campaign in the pages of its journals (French language articles to follow.) </p>

<p>With the widespread scattering of left forces, the Forward Group participated in a broad-based caucus within the Ontario NDP, championing socialist policies and opposing the growing conservativism of its leadership under the Rae government, by campaigning against the extension of public funding to Catholic schools, NDP anti-labor wage legislation and the failure to uphold the party program in and out of power.</p><p class="status">&#8212;
