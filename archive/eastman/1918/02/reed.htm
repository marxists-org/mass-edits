<p class="fst">John Reed&#8217;s appointment as consul general to
his own country by the Bolsheviki is the most beautiful
and astute expression they have given yet to the
international character of the class struggle and the
Social Revolution. In his own country John Reed has
been proscribed by the respectables,
and indicted by the courts as a traitor.
He will present his credentials
from the sovereign proletariat of
Russia to a bourgeois government
that has plans already on foot to put
him in jail.</p>

<p>When his absence was explained
to Judge Mayer at our arraignment
as conspirators against the
United States of America, the judge
said, &#8220;Is that the same Reed that
testified in the Berkman case?&#8221;</p>

<p>[Attorney Morris] Hillquit
told him it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well &#8211; you needn&#8217;t be in a
hurry about bringing him back. It
might be a good thing if he stayed there.&#8221;
It might be a good thing for the nationalistic
capitalism that Judge Mayer serves if John Reed stayed
in Russia. But it will be the best thing for industrial
freedom that could happen if he comes back an accredited
ambassador to the bourgeoisie from the international
revolutionary working class symbolized and
embodied in the Russian government. John Reed was
born to fill a high place in revolutionary times. He is
one of the few universal men &#8211; the men who combine
that arrant imagination and headstrong will of
adventure which are the attributes of poetic genius,
with a diligent and real power to achieve and understand.
There is nothing that needs to be done, either
in the technical routine of a consul general&#8217;s office, or
in the extraordinary and delicate duties of a revolutionary
emissary, that John Reed is
not abundantly equipped to do.</p>

<p>Milk-blooded people with a
nearsighted morality, consisting principally
of fear and decorum, when
they see a young man so full of power
and courage and poetry that he really
sets out to live, always call him
&#8220;wild&#8221; and &#8220;crazy&#8221; and &#8220;irresponsible.&#8221;
That is the way they talked
about Reed when he left Harvard.
They were jealous because he could
dive higher than any of them, and
dive deeper, too. And they knew he
would. And he has.</p>

<p>I have known John Reed for 5
years &#8211; worked with him, learned
of him, trusted him, and loved him. Starting off with
brilliant, emotional perceptions, and word combinations
in his mind like colors of flame, I have watched
him add to these native and dangerous gifts the habit
of verification and clear analytical understanding. I
knew when we sent him to Russia we were sending a
boon and counsellor to the revolution. And I know
that his history &#8211; the intimate history &#8211; of those
great days at Petrograd will be a light in the world&#8217;s
literature.</p>
