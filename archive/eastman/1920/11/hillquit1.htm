<p class="fst">Some people think that Morris Hillquit is a great
intellectual leader, others think he is a great politician,
but he seems to me to have missed fire in both these
capacities in his recent manifesto calling for a new Yellow
International. He issued his manifesto on September
23rd [1920], and that was just 14 days after the
famous old conservative French newspaper, <em>L&#8217;Humanit&eacute;</em>,
the stronghold of yellow socialism for years, turned
loose upon its astonished readers column after column
of pure communist propaganda. In the issue of September
9th, Marcel Cachin and L.D. Frossard, who
had been sent to Moscow for the purpose of &#8220;treating&#8221;
with the Bolshevist leaders, published in <em>L&#8217;Humanit&eacute;</em>
the 9 &#8220;conditions of affiliation&#8221; which they had brought
back with them, and declared that they accepted them
without serious alteration, and that they would henceforward
lead the struggle for the adoption of those
principles by the French party. And they took pains to
state that they would do this &#8220;in complete accord&#8221; with
that little group of Socialists and Syndicalists of the
extreme Left, gathered together originally, as I remember,
by Comrade Pericat, the &#8220;Committee of the Third
International.&#8221; To those who understand the
significance of things this news is almost as important
as the recent events in Italy.</p>
<p>There could hardly have been a less appropriate
time, from the standpoint at least of international politics,
to come out with an attack on the &#8220;dictatorship&#8221;
of the Third International, not replying to those 9
conditions of affiliation, but ignoring them altogether.
And there could hardly be a less favorable moment to
launch the call for the &#8220;new 2-1/2 International&#8221; than
the moment when <em>L&#8217;Humanit&eacute;</em> &#8211; the heart of the
French party &#8211; had abandoned it.</p>
<p>However, since Morris Hillquit will undoubtedly
be one of the chief founders of that International
&#8211; and perhaps the only one left by the time he gets
around to it &#8211; we are compelled to read his manifesto
with critical attention. Are its statements of fact
reliable? Are its arguments valid? Does he succeed in
making a case against the Third International from
the standpoint of sincere Socialism?</p>

<h4>Invective.</h4>
<p>In my opinion he makes a case against them upon
one single point only &#8211; he successfully accuses them
of calling him bad names. There is no doubt that the
Communists have chosen the method of polemics,
rather than of dispassionate demonstration, in compelling
the Socialists of the world to take their stand
for or against the process of revolution as they conceive
it. In this they seem to me to have acted unwisely,
but when I reflect that in a good many of the
countries of Europe the &#8220;Socialists&#8221; whom they denounce
have been shooting them down on the streets,
I cannot say there is anything unnatural in the tone of
their voice. At present I am satisfied to demonstrate
very quietly &#8211; as I am going to &#8211; that Hillquit&#8217;s arguments
are fallacious and his statements of fact unreliable.
But if he were coming after me with a machine
gun, I should probably agree with Zinoviev that he is
a &#8220;traitor&#8221; and &#8220;agent of the bourgeoisie.&#8221; At any rate,
it is not the tone of its voice of its choice of epithets
which will determine any intelligent man&#8217;s decision
about the Third International. As Marcel Cachin himself
says:</p>
<p class="indentb">We ought not to confound the truculent word of
accusation with the serious and profound truth which their
criticism contains. At bottom they tell us that in order to enter
the Third International it is necessary to fulfill one condition
and one only &#8211; to break vigorously with the policy of
collaboration, to act as Socialists, to prepare the coming revolution. The rest is a question of form.&#8221;</p>

<p>While agreeing that the Communist invective
&#8211; at least as directed toward &#8220;Centrists&#8221; &#8211; is not the
best political policy, I cannot refrain from adding that
there is a good deal of poetic justice in it. It gives me a
certain aesthetic pleasure to see Morris Hillquit in a
state of indignation because Zinoviev has &#8220;excommunicated&#8221;
him from the Third International as a traitor
and an agent of the bourgeoisie; and it will give the
same pleasure to about 60,000 others who were &#8220;excommunicated&#8221;
from the America Socialist Party by
Morris Hillquit&#8217;s minority machine as traitors and
agents of anarchy, for the simple reason that they advocated
the Third International. It may be bad politics,
but it is excellent dramatics. And any word of
objection which Morris Hillquit utters against the Left
Wing on the ground of its use of epithets can be turned
with equal force against himself and practically all of
his colleagues of the Right and Center.</p>

<h4>Novelty?</h4>
<p>There is no use pretending that this split in the
Socialist parties is new, or that the absolute mutual
intolerance of the two groups is new. It has always been
exactly the same &#8211; on the one hand revolutionary
Marxians, on the other reformists and diluters of Marxian
theory. They have always known their views to be
incompatible. They have always been ready to tear each
other&#8217;s eyes out. They have always called each other
&#8220;anarchists&#8221; on the one hand, and &#8220;agents of the bourgeoisie&#8221;
on the other. The Russian Revolution did not
alter this fact in the very least. What the Russian Revolution
did was to give each of these groups a chance to
show what it could do for Socialism. The reformist
group failed miserably, and the revolutionary group
succeeded gloriously. And for that reason the revolutionary
group, from being a pitiable academic minority
which the reformists could ignore or condescend
to smile at, has become a majority in a great many of
the Socialist organizations of the world, and is rapidly
becoming a majority in them all. The position of the
two groups is reversed, but their opinion of each other
is exactly what it was 5 years ago, when we of the
Marxian group in this country used to publish a little
inconspicuous and continually perishing, but terribly
conscientious, magazine called <em>The New Review</em>.</p>

<p>Morris Hillquit&#8217;s manifesto is an attempt to prevent
our group from becoming the majority in this
country and sweeping his group into the position of
negligibility which we formerly occupied. And it is
very astute of him to attempt to do this by asserting
that our doctrines are &#8220;new,&#8221; that they &#8220;emanate from
Moscow,&#8221; that they are &#8220;narrowly national,&#8221; that they
are a &#8220;glorified version&#8221; of Bolshevik &#8220;mistakes and
shortcomings,&#8221; that they are an attempt to submit the
working class movement of the world to a &#8220;dictatorship
of Russian Communism.&#8221; All these statements
are in my opinion absolutely false, and yet in calling
them astute I do not really mean to call them insincere.
I doubt if he ever read <em>The New Review</em>, except as
a comic paper. I doubt if he ever realized that the IWW
was a body of grown-up men and women lead by serious
and intelligent experts in revolutionary theory,
several of them more erudite than he is, if not so clever.
I believe that his sarcastic surprise at this relentless and
didactic laying down of the law to him and his crowd
by the new International is perfectly genuine. He thinks
that it &#8220;emanates from Moscow.&#8221; But almost every
word of it might be a quotation from anti-Hillquit
editorials in <em>The New Review</em>. The actual truth about
this matter is that the present Communist program
differs so little from the Left Wing Marxian position,
as expounded even before the war by such people as
Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, Lenin &#8211; or for a
concrete instance by Pannekoek in his debates with
Kautsky in 1912 &#8211; that one can only be astonished
at the boldness and practicality of their imagination.
Only because he did not take such writing seriously in
the past, and study them, does Hillquit find himself
surprised at the &#8220;newness&#8221; of the Communist position.
Anyone who did take them seriously in the past
and study them, could not fail to be surprised at the
opposite fact &#8211; namely, that the actual experience of
a successful revolution has added so little in the way of
general principles to the body of revolutionary science.</p>

<h4>Soviets.</h4>
<p>The one new and distinctly Russian contribution
to the Marxian theory is the name and idea of
soviets. These institutions played the dominating role
in the Russian Revolutions both of 1905 and 1917,
and they determined the form of the first proletarian
state. It is not an unnatural assumption that similar
institutions will play a leading role in other revolutions
and other proletarian states. Just as parliaments
and ministries, or parliaments and presidents, have
been the universal expression of the victory of the bourgeoisie
over the feudal regime, so soviets and commissars,
or some modification of the same, may very likely
be a universal expression of the victory of the proletariat
over the bourgeoisie. At least the fact that soviets
have been successful in one revolution is not an
argument against their revolutionary value. Hillquit
will have to agree, I think, that the burden of proof
rests on him. Let us see how he acquits himself of it.</p>

<p class="indentb">When the Bolshevist Party unfolded its active agitation
after the February revolution [he says] they demanded the
immediate convocation of a Constituent Assembly on the
basis of unrestricted franchise. The Soviets were already in
full swing, but the Bolsheviki secured a strong minority
representation in the Assembly, while the Socialist
Revolutionaries were in the majority. But between the
election and the meeting of the Assembly the Bolsheviki
had succeeded in capturing the Soviets and the government
machinery of the country. <em>It was then and then only</em> that
they coined the slogan &#8220;All power to the Soviets,&#8221; and
discovered that the Soviets were the only logical instrument
of proletarian rule. (My italics.)</p>

<p>That is an absolutely false account of what happened.
And anyone could find it out in a half hour&#8217;s
reading of almost any account of the Russian Revolution.
But I am going to leave all secondhand accounts
aside. Hillquit will find in a copy of the <em>Izvestiia</em> of
June 19, 1917 (new style) a speech of Lenin made on
June 17th to the first All-Russian Congress of the Soviets.
It was Lenin&#8217;s first great public speech after he
returned to Russia, and it was a speech anticipating
and supporting the Bolshevik resolution subsequently
to be introduced by Lunacharsky demanding that the
governmental authority be transferred to the Soviets.</p>
<p>
&#8220;There is no other course for these institutions,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;They cannot go backward or stand still. They
can only exist by going forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>

And, as though he anticipated the very argument
which Hillquitists were going to make against the Soviets
in future time, he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;They are a type of state which was not <em>invented
by Russians</em>, but <em>produced by revolution</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was on June 17, 1917, and Lenin&#8217;s speech
was followed on the same day by a speech to the contrary
effect by the Premier of the existing government,
Kerensky. In the <em>Izvestiia</em> of June 22nd [1917], Hillquit
will find the Bolshevist resolution introduced by
Lunacharsky, the concluding sentence of which reads
as follows:</p>

<p class="indentb">Having ascertained, therefore, the complete breakdown
of the policy of agreement with the capitalists, the
Convention finds that the only solution is the transfer of all
governmental authority into the hands of an All-Russian
Soviet of Workers, Soldiers, and Peasants&#8217; Deputies.</p>

<p>And if Hillquit wants to know exactly how far
the Bolsheviks had at that time succeeded in &#8220;capturing
the Soviets,&#8221; he will find in the same paper a report
of the voting on these two resolutions, the one
advocated by Kerensky and the one advocated by Lenin:</p>

<p class="fst">543 votes for the Menshevik Resolution.<br />
126 votes for the Bolshevik Resolution.<br />
52 not voting.<br />
65 delegates absent.</p></p>

<p>And if he will read the <em>Pravda</em> for June 29th
[1917] and the <em>Izvestiia</em> for July 3rd, he will find that
in the demonstration of July 1st organized by the same
convention, the Bolshevist minority carried in its line
of march the slogan, &#8220;All power to the Soviets!&#8221;</p>

<p>It seems worthwhile to me to establish this matter
in detail, because Hillquit is surrounded for many
minds with an atmosphere of scientific authority which
he has done little in recent years to merit. There could
hardly be a more inexcusable, or a more important,
misstatement of easily ascertainable facts than he has
made here.</p>

<p>But I confess that his reasoning seems even less
reliable to me than his facts. I cannot imagine a prettier
example of the fallacy of &#8220;argument in a circle&#8221;
than the one which Hillquit presents in these words:</p>

<p class="indentb">Let us assume [he says] the reverse of the situation,
i.e. that on the day of the opening of the Constituent
Assembly the Bolsheviki had found themselves in the
majority of that body, while the Soviets were in control of
the non-Bolshevik Socialist parties. Would the theoreticians
of Moscow Communism still insist upon the &#8220;dictatorship of
the proletariat in the form of Soviet power,&#8221; and would they
have dispersed their own Constituent Assembly? If I may
venture a guess I should say that in the hypothetical but not
impossible situation outlined, the body to be dispersed would
have been the Soviets, and the revolutionary formula now
preached to the world would have been &#8220;the dictatorship of
the proletariat in the form of a Constituent Assembly.&#8221;</p>

<p>In other words, &#8220;let us assume that the Soviets
had <em>not</em> proved to be the proper organs of revolution,
would the Bolsheviks still insist that they are?&#8221; Of
course they would not. The whole point of the matter
was that the Soviets <em>did</em> prove to be the proper organs
of revolution, and the fact that the Bolsheviks believed
they would, and that Lenin prophesied it <em>on the general
grounds of revolutionary theory</em> long before only adds
to the rigor of the concrete proof.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a legitimate question about
the universal value or necessity of exactly that form of
organization called Soviets, and if one is in a simple
state of mind about the matter, it needs only to be
simply state. It does not require any circulatory arguments
or misrepresentations of history to prove it. When Hillquit says that &#8220;If at the time of the first
outbreak of the Revolution of 1917 there had been in
Russia a strong and unified Socialist Party and a powerful
countrywide organization of labor unions, the
chances are that one, or, more likely, both of them,
would have taken charge of the situation&#8221; &#8211; he suggests
something whose possibility nobody can deny.
The value or necessity of forming Soviets under such
circumstances seems now to be in process of experimental
determination in Italy. And it si no doubt because
of this fact &#8211; and because the leaders of the
Third International are absolutely devoid of that bigotry
and narrow nationalism which Hillquit imputes
to them &#8211; that they have ceased to stress the demand
for the organization of Soviets. Neither in the 9 conditions
of affiliation which their Executive Committee
presented to the French Socialists, nor in the 21
conditions which their recent Congress [2nd: July 19-
Aug. 7, 1920] adopted for the presentation to the
Centrist parties in general, do they make any mention
of that Russian word, or any of its equivalents in other
languages. They do, on the other hand, expressly state
that the Executive Committee of the Communist International
must in all its decisions take account of
the &#8220;varied conditions under which the workers of different
countries are compelled to struggle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Communist International is centralized, it
is disciplinary, it is &#8220;the International of Action&#8221;; but
it is farther from dogmatic thinking and sectarian
emotion than any other Socialist body that ever existed.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>It seems, then, that Hillquit has not only attacked
the demands of the new International very ignorantly
and with false logic, but he has attacked them where
they no longer exist. He has based his entire argument
against the Third International upon a brief statement
in a letter written over a year ago, and signed only by
Zinoviev, the chairman of the Executive Committee.
It seems a little strange that he should have done this 2
weeks after the 9 &#8220;conditions of affiliation&#8221; were published
in Paris, and relayed to the newspapers of this
country &#8211; the <em>New York Times</em>, at least &#8211; by cable.
These 9 points were the Socialist news of the day. It is
difficult not to be a little impatient at Hillquit&#8217;s rushing
into print just while we were waiting for an accurate
copy of them, with this overwhelming attack upon
the Third International based upon a brief and wholly
outdated statement of its Executive Secretary.</p>

<p>It strains our patience still more when we notice
that Zinoviev himself declared in his own statement
that what he was saying applied only to &#8220;the present
moment.&#8221; This is what he said:</p>

<p class="indentb">The general unifying program is at the present moment
the recognition of the struggle for the dictatorship of the
proletariat in the form of Soviet power.... The so-called Center
is, in spite of its protestation, an <em>objectively</em> anti-socialist
tendency, because it cannot and does not wish to lead the
struggle for the Soviet power of the proletariat.<span class="note"><a id="f1" href="#a1" name="f1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>Hillquit says that this is &#8220;the sole specification
of offense which, as far as I know, the chairman of the
Moscow International has ever vouchsafed in his indictment
against the ‘Centrists.&#8217;&#8221; And here I must remark
again that for a leader of socialism and one of
the prospective founders of a new International, Morris
Hillquit&#8217;s knowledge does not extend very far. Has
he never read, or heard of, the reply of the Executive
Committee of the Third International to the proposal
of the German Independent Socialists to join with
them in forming that new International? It is the crucial
document in the whole matter upon which Hillquit
is presuming to deliver an opinion. It is dated
Moscow, February 5, 1920. It is signed by Zinoviev as President of the Executive Committee. It bears every
mark of his personal style. It contains not 1, but 11
&#8220;specifications of offense,&#8221; or, in his own words, &#8220;Capital
Faults,&#8221; of the leaders of the German Independent
Socialists and &#8220;the Centrist Parties in General.&#8221; And
after reciting these 11 points, which constitute a record,
sometimes of perfidy, sometimes of stupidity, sometimes
of vacillation, but never of clear speech and action
by these leaders in <em>their own countries</em>, it proceeds
to draw up 5 more counts in an indictment of their
<em>international attitude</em>. It is so devastating and yet so
true a document that if Hillquit really has not read it,
I can only congratulate him.</p>

<p>I will not quote the parts which characterize his
own position, but since he declares that the &#8220;Independent
Socialists of Germany rallied wholeheartedly to
the defense of the Soviet government,&#8221; and that &#8220;the
Moscow International expressed their appreciation of
this manifestation of International Socialist solidarity
by publicly denouncing them as renegades and traitors,&#8221;
I will quote a few sentences of its indictment of
some of the leaders of the German Independent Socialists.</p>

<p class="indentb">At the beginning of the revolution these Centrists formed
a coalition government with the declared traitors of the
working class &#8211; the Scheidemanns &#8211; they sanctioned the
shameful expulsion of the Berlin Ambassador of the Russian
proletariat, and sustained the policy of the rupture of
diplomatic relations with the Soviet power. The chiefs of the
Right of the Independents have from the beginning of the
German Revolution advocated an orientation towards the
Entente, and have opposed with all their power the alliance
of Germany with Soviet Russia....<br />
Their literary representatives who published their
writings in the same edition with bourgeois pacifist &#8220;democrats&#8221;
and the avowed servants of the bourse and bank,
could find not better activity than to spread the dirty scandals
of Russian and other counterrevolutionaries against the
Russian Revolution. A calumny as completely absurd and
dishonest as the so-called &#8220;Socialization of Women&#8221; in
Russia, which was invented by the generals and the spies
of the Entente, finds a place in the book of Kautsky. The
latest work of this writer, <em>Terrorism and Communism</em>, appears
in the same edition with the collection of falsified
documents discovered in America about the corruption of
the Bolsheviks by the German general staff. These examples
suffice to characterize the physiognomy of a series of
leaders of the Right of the German Independent Socialists.</p>

<p>That is a specimen of the &#8220;manifestation of International
socialist Solidarity&#8221; by Hillquit&#8217;s friends,
the German Independent Socialists of the Right.</p>

<p>And what manifestations by Hillquit himself, or
by any official, or any leader of the American Socialist
Party, except Eugene Debs? Not one single unqualified
word or gesture. Only the demand that our government
should stop waging war on them, that our government
should recognize theirs &#8211; the demand of
every intelligent bourgeois liberal in the United States.
Only that &#8211; and always accompanying it an assurance
to the American public that &#8220;we are not as they,&#8221;
&#8220;we do not believe in their methods,&#8221; &#8220;we are a different
kind of socialist&#8221; &#8211; an assurance which only finds
a complete culmination in this kind of manifesto itself.</p>

<p>Morris Hillquit, why do you try at the same time
to boast of your &#8220;solidarity&#8221; with the Communists of
Russia, and to expound with convincing lucidity your
absolute want of solidarity with them? Why not be as
straightforward as Victor Berger, who is against them,
and always has been against them, and always has candidly
said so? Do you not know as well as the does
that there has always been this split in the ranks of
those who call themselves socialists? Do you not know
that not only the same doctrines, but in several cases,
the same individuals whom you and he &#8220;excommunicated&#8221;
from the Socialist Party in America, with your
notorious Section 6, are now in Moscow helping to
excommunicate you from the Third International? ...</p>

<p>I should like to go on to say that Hillquit not
only missed the real issue of the 9 and the 21 points,
and the reply to the German Independents, but in
devoting himself to Zinoviev&#8217;s letter, he also dodged
Zinoviev and centered his attack for the most part upon
something which he read into that letter, and which is
not there at all &#8211; namely, the idea that we have in all
countries reached the point of overt action for the &#8220;immediate
realization&#8221; of Soviet governments.... But I
am cut off at this point by our new boss &#8211; the high
cost of paper. And I shall have to omit, or at least postpone,
what I was going to say under the title &#8220;Hillquit
Absorbs the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.&#8221;</p>


<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="endnote"><a id="a1" name="a1" href="#f1">1.</a> I put the word &#8220;objectively&#8221; in italics because I think the careful truthfulness implied in its use is so apt a refutation of Hillquit&#8217;s
