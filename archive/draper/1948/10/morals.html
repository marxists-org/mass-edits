<p class="fst"><strong>American Communism</strong><br />
by James Oneal and G.A. Werner<br />
<em>Dutton, New York, new rev. ed., 1947.</em></p>

<p class="fst">Frankly, I am not interested in reviewing this book as a whole but
only in calling attention to one chapter of it. The book, by a
leading light of the Social-Democratic Federation who was for long
the editor of the <strong>New Leader</strong>, is one prolonged
social-democratic scream of anguish at the bad Bolsheviki who split
the nice Socialist Party in 1919, and now look at them! Its value
even for rock-bottom facts will also be evident.</p>

<p>One of the new chapters added to this revised edition of Oneal&rsquo;s
old diatribe is Chapter 14 on <em>Trotskyism in America</em>. Oneal&rsquo;s
almost psychopathic hatred of any form of revolutionary Marxism is
well enough known &ndash; or was when I was in the SP in the &rsquo;30s
&ndash; and need not give pause; nor is it worth discussing. What is
remarkable about the chapter is the fact that this social-democratic
exponent of Honesty, Morality and Truth has put together a harangue
on Trotskyism which is (literally!) rivaled only by the Stalinist
garbage on the subject for unmitigated ignorance, outright
falsification and slander taken right out of the CP&rsquo;s
incinerator.</p>

<p>The information that Trotsky&rsquo;s son was named &ldquo;Gedov&rdquo;
and Stalin&rsquo;s name is &ldquo;Dzkugashvili&rdquo; might be passed
over as typo bloopers for Sedov and Djugashvili; but we are also told
that &ldquo;In his threefold capacity as Chairman of the Russian
Communist Party, head of the Soviet State, and Executive Secretary of
the Third International, Lenin wielded dictatorial power ...&rdquo;
(Lenin, of course, never held any but the second of these posts.)
Oneal: &ldquo;Trotsky did not accept his defeat with good grace. He
retreated, &lsquo;for his health,&rsquo; to a village in Turkestan,
Alma Ata ...&rdquo; (One <em>would</em> imagine that even an ignoramus
could find out that Trotsky was exiled by Stalin and did not &ldquo;retreat
for his health.&rdquo;) Oneal: &ldquo;His [Trotsky&rsquo;s] oratory
[at Brest-Litovsk] attracted the attention of the world but had very
little effect on Germany.&rdquo; Oneal: &ldquo;The Kerensky
Revolution occurred in 1917 ...&rdquo; (There wasn&rsquo;t any
Kerensky Revolution; Kerensky became head of the provisional
government only after the March revolution.)</p>

<p>On page 240 the doddering author has a more or less accurate
sentence about how the Trotskyists were expelled from the American CP
but &ldquo;decided to remain in the party and organized themselves
into a left-wing opposition known as the Communist League of
America.&rdquo; In writing the very next page, however, he apparently
fished out a note from a different wastebasket; for we find that
these same people at the same time &ldquo;decided to form an
independent party,&rdquo; &ldquo;on the advice of Comrade Trotsky,&rdquo;
and not even because they had been expelled but because they &ldquo;were
convinced that the Communist Party would not follow the &lsquo;Marxian&rsquo;
principles as outlined in the Trotsky program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So much for examples of plain ignorance, which is moreover the
democratic right of every writer on Bolshevism. When Oneal canters on
to the Moscow Trials, we get a horse of a different smell. Contrary
even to the wont of his social-democratic colleagues, the reader will
not find <em>him</em> charging the Stalinists with a frame-up &ndash;
no sir, not when it&rsquo;s Trotsky who is framed up: &ldquo;Trotsky
was at that time in exile in Mexico, but his enemies, the Stalinists,
feared that he was directing a world-wide conspiracy against the
Soviet Union.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did they indeed &ldquo;fear&rdquo; this so much that they invented
all the details of the conspiracy themselves? Oneal won&rsquo;t say;
he quotes the GPU&rsquo;s accusations, gives a bit of the floor to
the Dewey investigating commission, and winds up:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Dr. Dewey was <em>laboring under the illusion</em>
that if American labor &lsquo;knew the truth, the truth would make
them free&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Such cynicism, Mr. Social-Democrat!</p>

<p>The smell, however, becomes overpowering in the following precious
passage. If something of this sort were perpetrated by a Marxist
against one of Oneal&rsquo;s highly moral social-democrats, it would
undoubtedly reverberate down the pages of the <strong>New Leader</strong> as a
stock example of Bolshevik dishonesty. These are Oneal&rsquo;s actual
words:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;In the labor movement they [the Trotskyists] have
gained a name for themselves as the &lsquo;Trotskyite Fifth Column,&rsquo;
especially among their &lsquo;friends,&rsquo; the Stalinites. George
Morris, a Communist, exposed their activities in the labor unions, as
well as their anti-government activities during the Second World War,
in a pamphlet published by the New Century Publishers [CP press &ndash;
<em>P.C.</em>], 1945.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">This pamphlet by the Stalinist hack Morris, entitled <strong>The
Trotskyite 5th Column in the Labor Movement</strong>, which is also openly
and brazenly cited as the source of other &ldquo;facts&rdquo; by our
rabidly anti-Bolshevik author (even though he cannot even quote its
title correctly), is a real curiosity for the collector. The leading
&ldquo;Trotskyite&rdquo; lambasted in this typical piece of Stalinist
filth is &ndash; Tucker Smith, the present vice-presidential
candidate of the Socialist Party! Indeed, he is honored with a
special appendix of three pages quoting an &ldquo;expos&eacute;&rdquo;
of his Trotskyite wrecking activities by no less an authority than
Dan Tobin&rsquo;s executive assistant. Two other &ldquo;Trotskyites&rdquo;
exposed are Oneal&rsquo;s friends, Max Eastman and Alexander Barmine.
Outside of the Minneapolis Trial defendants, there is not another
&ldquo;Trotskyite fifth-columnist&rdquo; named in the pamphlet!</p>

<p>Such is the &ldquo;job&rdquo; done on the Trotskyists by one of
the leading figures of that group which specializes in deducing the
ills of the world from the detestably dishonest habits of Leninism
and Leninists. No, we do not claim to be &ldquo;the only moral
people&rdquo; in politics but ... honestly, there aren&rsquo;t <em>very</em>
many others!</p>
