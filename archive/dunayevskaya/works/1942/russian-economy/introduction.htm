<h3>An Analysis of Russian Economy</h3>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade>
<h1>Introductory Note</h1>

<br>
<p class="fst">The National Editorial Board of News &amp; Letters Committees is proud to print the very first (1942) comprehensive study from original sources of the Russian economy which its analyst, F. Forest (Raya Dunayevskaya), called state-capitalist. As the readers will see, this historic study by an American founder of the theory of state-capitalism, was grounded in Marx&#8217;s greatest theoretical work, <strong>Capital</strong>.</p>

<p>The four year lapse between the first set of articles and the second (1946) series on political conclusions was not due to a division between economics and politics in the original analysis, any more than the concentration on the nature of the Russian economy meant a separation from the new stage of the world economy signified by the Depression. Rather, it was due, on toe one hand, to the vicissitudes of being a Minority in the Trotskyist movement, and, on the other hand, to the shock that state-capitalism had appeared first in Russia, which had been a workers&#8217; state.</p>

<p>Refusing to recognize that Russia had been transformed into a state-capitalist society, even when its politics took the form of the Hitler-Stalin Pact in 1939, Leon Trotsky continued to consider Russia &#8220;a workers&#8221; state, though degenerate,&#8221; and at the outbreak of World War H called for its defense. This led to a split in the Trotskyist movement. The founding, first of the Tendency based on the state-capitalist theory which was never separated from new forms of workers&#8217; revolt, and then of Marxist-Humanism, coincided by no accident whatever with the objective movements the world over for a totally new society.</p>

<p>It was no accident that the counter-revolutionary suppression of the Hungarian Revolution went hand-in-hand with the suppression of thought. It was Mao who urged Khruschev to crush the Hungarian Revolution; and it was both Mao and Khrushchev who designated Marxist Humanists as &#8220;revisionists,&#8221; and &#8220;revisionism&#8221; as the &#8220;main danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dual rhythm in the dialectics of liberation, uprooting the old and creating the new, points the way to a unity of philosophy and revolution which alone assures what Marx called &#8220;the development of human power which is its own end.&#8221;</p>
