THE PHENOMENA OF CAPITALISM: BUYING AND SELLING OF COMMODITIES</h2>
<h3>Lecture 2<br />
Part I, Chapter 1<br />
Use-Value and Value</h3>
<p>&#8220;The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails,&#8221; Marx writes at the beginning of the work, &#8220;presents itself as an immense accumulation of commodities, its unit being a single commodity. Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity.&#8221; (p. 41)</p>
<p>Marx begins his analysis of a commodity with a description of its two-fold nature; <em>use value and value</em> &#8220;As values all commodities are only definite masses of congealed labor time.&#8221; (p. 46) It is important to note that Marx mentions, but does not here stop to analyze the <em>form of value</em>, which is <em>exchange value</em>. Rather he proceeds directly to the crucial point, which is not the dual form of the commodity, but the dual form of labor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the first to point out and to examine critically this two-fold nature of the labour contained in commodities,&#8221; Marx writes. &#8220;As this is the pivot on which a clear comprehension of political economy turns, we must go more into detail.&#8221; (p. 48) It is impossible to understand Marxist political economy without a thorough understanding of the pivot on which it revolves.</p>
<p>First, Marx explains the antagonism latent in the two-fold character of labor: &#8220;An increase in the quantity of use values is an increase of material wealth. With two coats two men can be clothed, with one coat only one man. Nevertheless, an increased quantity of material wealth may correspond to a simultaneous fall in the magnitude of its value. This antagonistic movement has its origin in the two-fold character of labor.&#8221; (p. 53)</p>
<p>In order to comprehend this, we must keep clearly in mind this two-fold character: abstract labor creates value and concrete labor creates use values. &#8220;On the one hand, all labor is speaking physiologically, an expenditure of human labor power and in its character of identical abstract human labor it creates and forms the value of commodities. On the other hand, all labor is the expenditure of human labor power in a special form and with a definite aim and in this, its character of concrete, useful labor it produces use-values.&#8221; (p. 54)</p>
<h5>Value Forms</h5>
<p>Marx next considers the value forms of a commodity. These four forms are: (1) the elementary or accidental form of value; (2) the total or expanded form; (3) the general form; and (4) the money form.</p>
<p>(The teacher will have to be patient in going over this section where Marx is very dialectical and the concepts are quite complex. The task will be made easier, however, if the historical development is constantly held in view. As for example, the following.)</p>
<p>The first or elementary form &#8211; 20 yards of linen equal one coat &#8211; shows us not only the theoretical aspect of the development of a commodity but its <em>historic root</em>: &#8220;...the elementary value-form is also the primitive form under which a product of labor appears historically as a commodity and the gradual transformation of such products into commodities, proceeds <em>pari passu</em> with the development of the value-form.&#8221; (p. 7l)</p>
<p>Note how the historical approach is used to explain why such a great thinker as Aristotle could not see that it is the common substance of human labor, which makes such different use-values as beds and houses commensurate in certain proportions:</p>
<p>&#8220;There was, however, an important fact which prevented Aristotle from seeing that, to attribute value to commodities, is merely a mode of expressing all labor as equal human labor and consequently as labor of equal quality. Greek society was founded upon slavery and had, therefore, for its natural basis, the inequality of men and their labor powers. The secret of the expression of value, namely, that all kinds of labor are equal and equivalent because and so, far as they are human labor in general cannot be deciphered until the notion of human equality has already acquired the fixity of a popular prejudice.&#8221; (p. 69)</p>
<p>Before leaving the section dealing with the form of value or exchange value, let us bear in mind what Marx says on page 70: &#8220;When at the beginning of this chapter, we said, in common parlance, that a commodity is both a use-value and an exchange value, we were, accurately speaking wrong. A commodity is a use-value or object of utility and a value. It manifests itself as this two-fold thing, that it is, as soon as its value assumes an independent form &#8211; viz. &#8211; the form of exchange value. It never assumes this form when isolated but only when placed in a value or exchange relation with another commodity of a different kind.&#8221;</p>
<h5>The Fetishism of Commodities</h5>
<p>As important as the concept of value in Chapter I is the concept of the fetishism of commodities. To stamp an object of utility as a value, says Marx, is as much a social product as is language. Whence, indeed, arises the enigmatical character of products of labor so soon as they assume the form of commodities? &#8220;Clearly,&#8221; answers Marx, &#8220;from this form itself.&#8221; <em>It is this form which makes &#8220;a definite social relation between men</em>&#8221; assume &#8220;<em>the fantastic form of a relation between things</em>.&#8221; (p. 83) This is the fetishism of commodities. (Italics mine F.F)</p>
<p>&#8220;Value does not stalk about with a label describing what it is. It is value, rather, that converts every product into a social hieroglyphic.&#8221; (p. 85)</p>
<p>&#8220;The categories of bourgeois economy... are forms of thought expressing with social validity the conditions and relations of a definite historically determined mode of production, viz., the production of commodities. The whole mystery of commodities, all the magic and necromancy that surrounds the product of labor as long as they take the form of commodities, vanish, therefore, so soon as we come to other forms of production.&#8221; (p. 87)</p>
<p>In other societies, where the product of labor did not assume the <em>form </em>of a commodity, social relations were clear; &#8220;Compulsory labor is just as properly measured by time, as commodity-producing labour; but every serf knows that what he expends in the service of his lord, is a definite quantity of his own personal labour-power The tithe to be rendered to the priest is more matter of fact than his blessing. No matter, then, what we may think of the parts played by the different classes of people themselves in this society, the social relations between individuals in the performance of their labor, appear at all events as their own mutual personal relations, and are not disguised under the shape of social relations between the products of labor.&#8221; (p. 89)</p>
<p>Finally, Marx shows that only production by <em>freely</em> associated men will hold no mysteries. &#8220;The life-process of society, which is based on the process of material production does not strip off its mystical veil until it is treated as production by freely associated men and is consciously regulated by them in accordance with a settled plan.&#8221; (p. 92)</p>
