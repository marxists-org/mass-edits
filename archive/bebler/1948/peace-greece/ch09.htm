<h4>The Greek Army on the United States Payroll</h4>
<p class="fst">
We have already said that the so-called American Economic Aid to
Greece was actually not given for the reconstruction of the economy of
Greece, but that almost all the credits have been used for waging war against
the Greek people, i.e. for military purposes: for supplying, arming and expanding the armed forces of the Athens Government. To this end a military group
was attached to the American Mission, headed by General Livesay. At the
beginning the Mission elaborated a plan according to which half of the sum
total was to be spent for military purposes, viz. 150 million dollars. However,
it soon became evident that this sum would not be sufficient and it was raised
by an additional 9 million dollars. Even this was not sufficient in the opinion
of the Mission. The so-called battalions of the National Guard were to be
increased from 40 to 100; and 12,000 recruits were to be sought for the
regular army. In this connection the Mission granted an additional 50 million
dollars for military expenditure. Thus the total sum reserved for military
purposes reached 174 million dollars and the Mission was obliged to shorten
by three months the period during which the economic program had been
intended to operate&#8212;from June 31 to March 31, 1948&#8212;with the provision
that during the period of these three months there was to be only military
expenditure.
</p><p>
In the report issued by the American Mission on March 12, 1948, the
anniversary of the proclamation of the "Truman Doctrine", it is said that
since the arrival of the Mission in Greece "more than 60 million dollars worth
of major items for the land and air forces alone have actually been received
in Greece, and further shipments of such material, of considerable value, will
continue to arrive at regular intervals." However, General Livesay, Chief of
the Military Group of the American Mission, declared in an interview given
to the press on January 13, 1948, that over 100 million dollars had been spent
for the equipment of the Greek Army up to that time, and that the total
quantity of military items imported by January 23, 1948, amounted to
90,070 tons.
</p><p>
The fact that the whole monarcho-fascist army, the so-called National
Guard, the gendarmerie and the police are today on the payroll of the United
States of America is not concealed even by official American circles. In the
above mentioned report it is said, "Since the 1st of September last, the United
States has furnished food rations for every Greek soldier, for every member of
the Navy, Air Force and National Defense Battalions, every member of the
gendarmerie and every policeman. It has issued all replacements of uniforms
and new uniforms to meet all increases in the Armed Forces."
</p><p>
If we keep in mind that the above-mentioned huge sums, increased in
1948 by a military credit of approximately 250 million dollars, have been
spent for military purposes and for war material in the limited sense, mainly
for arms and equipment; that similar huge sums have been spent for products
supposedly intended for peaceful purposes but which were, in fact, used by
the army; that the so-called reconstruction of the country is serving exclusively military purposes, such as the widening of roads from S to 9 meters
for the use of mechanized units, the reconstruction of the ports of Pyraeus,
Salonika, Alexandropolis, Kavala and others, of the airfields of Kozana, Seres,
Kavala, etc., and the construction of various roads and bridges for strategic
purposes, then it becomes clear why so little remained for the economic
reconstruction proper.</p>
