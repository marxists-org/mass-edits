<h4>Goebbels Speaks in Greek</h4>


<p class="fst">
The campaign of warmongering in Greece against the democratic countries not only resembles Fascist and Nazi propaganda, but has taken over textually Goebbels' slogan about the so-called Slav danger, which Hitler used to
justify the occupation of Slav countries. These anti-Slav slogans are being systematically spread in Greece through the press, radio, schools, and statements
by the most responsible persons.
</p><p>
The propaganda which is spread within the Greek Government army is best
illustrated by statements of deserters from those forces, who are now in Yugo-
slavia. We shall quote Lukas Galakanos, 506th Battallion, 21st Brigade, 2nd
Division, and Peter Iskov, 3rd Labor Battalion, No. 903. Lukas Galakanos
said: "They held systematic lectures against the U.S.S.R. and the Slavs. Konstantinos Azimakopulos...said that Greece could occupy Albania, Serbia and
Bulgaria in a week's time, and that the Slav tribe is barbarian. We were forced
to sing 'Sofia, Moscow, must be occupied!' " Peter Iskov said: "We were compelled to sing the song of Xitites, 'Sofia, Moscow, must be occupied.' Once
General Papageorgyu came to us and delivered a speech against the Slays and
our Northern neighbours, saying that we should change our ideas.' "
