<h4>A Little Reminder of the Atom Bomb</h4>

<p class="fst">
The Athens press took pains to explain to the public the particular significance of these American demonstrations. Thus the newspaper Akro polls
of September 18, explains that "The giant B29 is of the same type as the
plane which carried the atom bomb for the bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. During the last three years this plane has been improved, so that
today a B29 could fly from American territory to Moscow, drop the atom
bomb on Moscow and return to one of the American bases in North Africa
without landing." (The readers could of course read instead of the words
"North Africa," "Greece.")
</p><p>
The paper continues: "The purpose of the United States-Athens flight
was to show the capacity of B29, while its great strategic significance will not escape the attention of competent persons, a fact which was also stressed. This giant plane can transport rockets in addition to atom bombs."
</p><p>
It is obvious that such American military actions in Greece have another
significance also. They are a brutal menace directed against the peaceful
neighbours of Greece and against the Soviet Union. Thus Greece, as a United
States base, has become a menace to world peace and international security.
