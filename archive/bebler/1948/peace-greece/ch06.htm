<h4>A Little Gentle Pressure</h4>

<p class="fst">
In order to give "moral support" to such threats, Greece was suddenly &#8212;
as is well-known by the inhabitants of Athens &#8212; deprived of fuel. Lighting,
heating, industry and transportation stopped as if by enchantment. The
whole economic life of the country was paralyzed. The American Mission forbade the importation of gasoline, oil and coal. It goes without saying that this
method of solving" internal conflicts and dissensions in the Greek Government produced the desired effect and that the dissensions between the two
"chiefs" with regard to the division of power were immediately ironed out.
I think that these facts need no further comment.
</p><p>
Having thus formed a new Government by open pressure and interference, the United States of America did not allow any change to be made
in that Government without its consent. Thus, during the Government crisis,
in January, 1948, the American Charge d'Affaires in Athens, Mr. Rankin,
according to the Greek press, visited Souphulis and Tsaldaris on January 18,
1948, and delivered to them, by order of his Government, an Aide Memoire
in which it was stressed that the possible resignation of the Government would
not only have "unfavorable results as regards the success of the program for
aid to Creece, but would certainly also unfavorably influence any thought of
further aid to Greece, as well as the amount of the aid that Greece will receive
under the Marshall Plan."
</p><p>
This is the inexorable logic of the acceptance of so-called American aid,
a logic which has found in Greece a classical expression.
</p><p>
The <em>Chicago Tribune</em> of January 22, 1948, openly admits: "&#8230; since
we have taken over Greece, we have changed the composition of the Government several times, according to our wishes."<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1</a></sup>
</p><p>
However, it is not only a question of the Athens Government being in
harmony with "American wishes", to quote the poetic reference of the
<em>Chicago Tribune</em> to this Government. The fact is that the whole organization
of the various services of the American Mission are, in fact, being transformed
into governing administrative bodies in Greece. It is no secret that the
American representatives in Athens are assuming prerogatives of the Government. It is the American representatives and not the Government who draft
laws and decrees, submitting them to Parliament &#8212; only to satisfy Western
parliamentary democracy &#8212; which has to adopt them without amendments.
This was also the case with the law on the blocking of Greek assets abroad,
the adoption of which was made a condition by the American Mission for
giving the assistance which was needed for the importation of wheat.</p>

<p class="fst"><a href="#1b" name="1">1.</a>  American readers are prone to overlook a good many revelatory items of news when they
are tucked away inconspicuously in their papers, without benefit of big headlines. Although
Dr. Bebler quotes mostly from the Greek press, a great many citations could be culled from
the American press also, in illustration and support of his charge that the United Stares has
in fact taken over the political rule and economic domination of Greece.
