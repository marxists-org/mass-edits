<h4>A Slaughter of the Innocents</h4>

<p class="fst">
"One hundred and twenty children of persecuted democratic citizens
from Rumelia took shelter in the village of Stromni Gioni. When the 567th
and 569th battalions of the monarcho-fascist 307th Brigade seized Stromni,
the women and old men attempted to flee with the children to the heights of
Gioni Mountain; but the troops furiously pursued them, and slaughtered
every child that fell into their hands. Among the victims were four children
of Captain of the Democratic army Micos Fenagaras, from Kirtaki in Ftiotide;
three children of Captain Kostas, from Smokovo village; four children of
the democratic citizen Skafidas, from Skafi in the region of Ipate; two children of Micos Floros from Aguri; and many others. The few children and
old men who escaped death were found ten days later by scouts of the Democratic Army in the ditches of Gioni, where they had taken shelter, feeding on
grass and roots."
</p><p>
It was because of such occurrences, Fellow Delegates, that the parents
decided to take their children across the frontier into the neighbouring countries. They did it in order to save them from the monarcho-fascist hell. The
Yugoslav Red Cross, moved by humanitarian compassion, acted promptly to
provide shelter for these children. A large number were soon thereafter given
shelter by the Red Crosses of other democratic countries.
</p><p>
The Athens Government which is guilty and responsible for the sufferings and miseries of Greek children did not shrink from trying to capitalize
their bitter lot in its campaign against its democratic neighbors. Fearing the
judgement of the world for its crimes, the victims of which included Greek
children, the Athens Government started a campaign to mislead world public
opinion by accusing Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and other democratic countries
which sheltered these children from the horrors of war.
