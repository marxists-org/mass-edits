<h4>Material Might vs. Democratic Determination</h4>

<p class="fst">
American General Livesay, and General Van Fleet, his successor, have
several times tried unsuccessfully to achieve this. They thought they could
crush the Greek Democratic Army by the sheer weight of hundreds of thousands of tons of war materials and American military equipment, as well as
by a huge superiority in numbers, if not by their military skill and leadership.
They boasted that the Democratic Army would soon be crushed, annihilated.
The U.S. Ambassador in Athens, Mr. Grady, is again making such boastful
predictions, having learned nothing from the experience of his military
colleagues.
</p><p>
The Democratic Army not only escaped annihilation, but has come out
of all the campaigns and battles more experienced, bigger and stronger, better
organized, with bigger units and divisions. In view of the smallness of the
country and its relative poverty, this struggle of the Greek people is one of
the most beautiful examples of the heroism of which a proud people is capable,
one of the most beautiful examples of the inexhaustible resources which a
people fighting for a just cause discover within themselves.
</p><p>
The army of the Athens Government, armed with the most up-to-date
American and British weapons, with jet planes, with the most modern artillery, with tanks and other arms, well supplied with food and equipment,
commanded by American and British generals and other officers: nevertheless
despite its superiority of ten to one in effectiveness, and of 50 to one in
armaments, as well as its absolute mastery in the air and on the sea, not only
failed in its task of crushing the Democratic Army of Greece, but even failed
to prevent that army breaking through the ring on Grammos, making its way
to the rear of the enemy, entering Rumelia and Thessaly, and expanding the
liberated territory.
</p><p>
The offensive power of the Democratic Army of Greece is best illustrated
by figures given out by the GHQ of that army for the period June 14&#8211;August 21, 1948, during the battle of Grammos:
</p><p>
"According to incomplete data the monarcho-fascists suffered the following losses: 512 dead, 16,000 wounded, 439 prisoners, 1,289 surrendered.
In the same period the anti-aircraft defense of the Democratic Army shot
down 35 planes. Eighteen tanks and five guns were destroyed, and large
quantities of war material captured." Such were the results of the widely-advertised Summer offensive of the Athens forces, of that 'death blow' against
the Democratic Army which was struck under American Military Mission
leadership, headed by General Van Fleet, with hundreds of American and
British officers actively participating. This has proved to the world that the
Greek Democratic army has emerged from the Grammos operation stronger
than ever, more organized, endowed with greater war experience and skill,
and that it has attained in struggle a higher degree of military organization
and has begun the organization of units capable of executing large-scale
strategic operations.
</p><p>
The formation of the Provisional Greek Democratic Government with
General Markos at its head, in December 1947, was a consequence on the one
hand of the great successes achieved by the Democratic Army, and on the
other hand of the failure of the Athens regime and foreign intervention. As
in the program jnd activities of the Provisional Greek Democratic Government, we emphasize here, before the United Nations, its peaceful foreign
policy, inspired by the principles of the United Nations charter; and especially
its wish to solve the Greek problem by national reconciliation based on a
democratic and loyal agreement," a wish which should find its best reception
iii the United Nations, for its fulfillment would transform Greece from a
hotbed of trouble into a factor for peace.</p>
