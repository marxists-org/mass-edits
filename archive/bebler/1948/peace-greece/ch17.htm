<h4>And Provocations from High Places</h4>


<p class="fst">
But the provocations against the people's democracies do not stop there.
From the very beginning of Anglo-American intervention in Greece the controlled press of that country has been full of anti-Soviet and anti-Balkan propaganda. This propaganda in the press is echoed by high officials of the Athens Government. The official propaganda of the Athens Government is
based on anti-Soviet, anti-Balkan and anti-Slav slogans, from the Fascist songs,
such as "Moscow, Sofia must be occupied", to the inflammatory speeches of
General Ketses, who told the units on the Peloponnesus that they were "fighting against 200 million Slays."

<em>Vradini,</em> the personal newspaper of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the
Athens Government, and the newspaper <em>Ethniltos Kiriks</em> are openly advocating
war and the invasion of Albania by the army. In a leading article published on
August 24, 1948 it is said that the time will come when the army will lose
patience and will invade Albania. <em>Ethniltos Kiriks</em> in its leading article of
August 25, 1948, entitled "Let us Invade" prints the following: "We should
send an ultimatum to the Albanians and if they do not accept it, we should
enter the country immediately and demolish the Albanian State. If the numerous hostile and indecent acts which have occurred between the 'Allies' have
not become a cause for war, then let our invasion of Albania be such a cause."
This statement needs no comment.

For the provocative military activities on the frontiers of the northern
neighbours of Greece, and the ever-growing war-mongering propaganda with
its aggressive tone, are two sides of the same medal. Radio Athens said in the
course of a broadcast to Northern Greece on February 26, 1948: "The Greek
problem will be settled through rectification of the northern frontiers by the Greek Army. 	Stressing the plans for annexations of Yugoslav territory,
Radio Athens announced in its broadcast of February 2: "Bitolj is Greek and
so are the Greek localities of Magareva and Trnovo. Skoplje and Kumanovo,
Stip, Prizren and Mitrovica are also Greek." All these towns are in Yugoslavia,
some of them over 100 km. inside the Yugoslav border. On August 30, a
speaker over radio Athens, expounded the Greek pretensions concerning Yugoslav and Bulgarian territories, and quoted from the book written by a former
high officer of the Greek army, Periklis Yakov Agiropulos, who particularly
said: "When a feeling of security is created through rectification of the
frontier to cut off Bulgaria's road to the Aegean Sea and to Salonika, the aid
extended for the reconstruction of Greece will have value. The ethnical, historical and natural frontiers of Greece run just south of the Emos-Kosifopedion-Alesio line" &#8212; i.e. just south of Balkan Mountain in Bulgaria, Kosovo Field in
Yugoslavia, Alesi in Albania. Agiropulos continues, "Greece is not asking for
foreign territory when she claims Northern Epirus or Bitolj, Djevdjelija,
Doyran and the Strumica Plain." But all these places are in Yugoslavia!

The Greek newspaper <em>Kathirnerini</em> in its issue of August 31, 1948, states
that "In the most responsible circles the idea prevails that if the Soviet Government and its satellites, as it is believed, are not prepared for open conflict, there
is no reason in the world why an expeditionary corps should not be sent into
Albania to give a good lesson to this perfidious little country. Such action
would prove in a flaming manner that the Western Powers are ready to act;
and that, basing themselves on the support of the General Assembly of the
United Nations, they could pursue such tactics as long as they possess a
monopoly of the atom bomb!"</p>
