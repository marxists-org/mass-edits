<h4>Gen. Van Fleet: "Capture and Kill"</h4>

<p class="fst">
It is evident that the direct and principal aim of the American so-called
economic aid to Greece is to throttle the insurrection of the Greek people.
From the report of the American Mission which we have already quoted,
there is no doubt left about this. We read there, "since the end of the offensive
of the Greek army in the Spring of 1947, the Greek military forces limited
themselves to defensive tactics. That is the reason why the bandits were able
to recapture territories and organize attacks. Since its arrival the American
Mission has consistently exerted its influence to instigate offensive tactics
</p><p>
Since the end of last year, American officers arrived in Greece and were
sent to all military units, in the capacity of "advisors" and "liaison officers."
A mixed American High Command was created#8212;a High Command which
was "mixed" only in the sense that it was composed of American specialists
for infantry, marine and aviation.
</p><p>
The new chief of the American Mission in Greece, General Van Fleet,
who arrived in Greece on February 20th of this year, immediately made a
declaration about the necessity of undertaking a large-scale offensive against
the democratic army.
</p><p>
This American general is today notorious because of his brutal slogan:
"Capture and kill," which recalls the words of gauleiters in the days of the
occupation of my country, as well as all the other occupied countries of
Europe, and reminds me also of the well-known order given by Kaiser Wilhelm to his troops when leaving for China: "Gefangene werden nicht
gemacht"&#8212;"No prisoners are to be taken."
</p><p>
Describing the subservience of armed forces of the Athens Government
to the United States military, Mr. Kenneth Spencer, the British observer with
the Anti-Balkan Commission wrote in an article reported in the <em>New Statesman</em> and <em>Nation</em>: "The Greek Army lights in British battledress with British
and American equipment, and is now virtually under the command of American officers right down to battalion level. General Van Fleet, Chief of the
Military Observer and Advisor Teams operating with the Greek Army,
personally inspired the Army's spring and summer offensives and his liaison
officers with divisions, brigades and battalions give the commanders operational advice which no officer can presume to ignore." General Van Fleet, like
his predecessor, General Livesay, attends all the meetings of the so-called
"Council of National Defense" of the Greek Government and all other important military conferences."
