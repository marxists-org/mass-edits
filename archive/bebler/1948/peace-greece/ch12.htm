<h4>The Why and Wherefore</h4>

<p class="fst">As I said at the beginning of my speech, the principal aim of the military
intervention of the United States of America in Greece is to transform Greece
into a strategic base and a military bridgehead. From the very beginning of
the intervention, the United States of America started to build new airfields
and harbours in Greece. Thus the report of the American Mission dated
December 1947, says that reconstruction and improvement of five airfields in
Northern Greece at Salonika, Kavala, Kozana, Yannina and Larissa, as well
as of the airfield at Helenicon, was undertaken; and in the report of March
12, 1948, it is said that "airfields at keypoints have been constructed, and
made available for allweather landings, greatly increasing the striking power
of the air force. At the same time, anti-aircraft guns have been installed for
their protection." Further, it is said in the same report that "the American
Mission is paying all costs and is furnishing all the materials on all of these
airfields." Dwight Griswold, who was until recently Chief of the American
Mission, stated to the representatives of the press while on his way to the
United States, that during the year of his administration, Greece had been
supplied with 210,000 tons of various war materials, that 6 military airfields
for heavy bombers had been constructed, and large ports repaired for military
purposes.
</p><p>
The British observer in the Anti-Balkan Commission, Kenneth Spencer,
writes in his article: "...all indications are that the Americans want to stay
in Greece...The American Mission for Aid to Greece controls finance,
imports and exports, and the army; and all-weather airfields have been repaired
in Northern Greece at Salonika, Kozani and Kavala with runways obviously
planned for heavy bombers rather than for Spitfires and Dakotas of the
Greek airforce."
</p><p>
Thus we see that the U.S.A. is constructing airfields in Northern Greece
on the borders of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Albania, thousands of miles from
American shores. These airfields are intended for heavy bombers, for an offensive strategic airforce.
</p><p>
The reconstruction of the ports of Piraeus, Salonika, and Kavala, the
building of roads in Northern Greece leading toward the frontiers of the
Northern neighbours of Greece, such as the Athens-Thebes-Livadia-Larissa-
Kozani-Veria road; the Volos-Larissa-Trikala road; the Arta-Philippiada-Yannina-Preveza road; the Anfipolis-Kavala road, etc., are a striking indication of the role assigned to Greece in the American plan for world domination.</p>
