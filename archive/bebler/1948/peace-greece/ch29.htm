<h4>All Greece Rises</h4>

<p class="fst">
I can now point out one consequence of this development: the Athens
government and its foreign protectors have lost their main "argument," viz.
that the guerrilla fighting in Greece is localized to areas in the northern parts
0f Greece, which allegedly proves that the figting is inspired and supported
liv Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Albania.
</p><p>
Today, however, it is precisely in the Peloponnesus, hundreds of kilometers from the northern frontiers and surrounded by the sea, that the
national uprising has attained its most spectacular growth and has had its
most significant successes. The Greek newspaper <em>Estia</em> of August 27 stated,
"On the Peloponnesus banditism has an undeniable originality. There the
bandits are on the one hand among the population, which has always notably
shown its faith in national ideals and respect for law; and on the other hand,
they are not near the frontiers of the satellites of Russia." The Peloponnesus,
which the newspaper <em>Elephteria</em> of August 29th, 1948, calls the "cradle of
individualism bordering on reaction," and the newspaper <em>Laiki Gnoini</em> of
August 30 describes as the "conscious cradle of ancient Hellenism" &#8212; this
Peloponnesus, this "cradle of individualism" and of "ancient Hellenism,"
today participates in the movement which is called "Slavophil" and "Communist."
</p><p>
We may very well understand the despair of the rightist newspaper
Akropolis of September 21, 1948, which asks, "Do we wish to arm the
Russians at the General Assembly of the United Nations to oppose our case?
It can easily be achieved! Let us leave the Peloponnesus in the hands of
Markos. Vyshinsky could not wish for a better argument!"
</p><p>
But the cries of distress of the newspaper <em>Akropolis</em> cannot alter the fact
that the flames of widespread national insurgency have swept the Peloponnesus,
and no argument could prove that this revolt has been instigated, aided or
organized by Yugoslavia. This uprising, like the uprisings throughout Greece,
is an answer to the ever-increasing intervention of the United States of
America in Greece and the mounting terrorism of the Athens Government.
</p><p>
<em>Akropolis</em> in the above mentioned article furthermore admitted: "There
is not a single inch of Peloponnese soil which is not suffering from the partisan illness of banditism...Grammos has fallen, Murgana is subjected, we
are victorious on the Kaymakchalan, while the land of Peloponnesus is not
free...The bandit is lurking everywhere, ragged, but armed, fearless, impudent...to show that he is the master of the situation in the immediate
vicinity of the town, although he does not enjoy the advantage of others who
are able to flee to Albania or to the Slays in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. The
Peloponnese partisans are operating...in a limited area surrounded by the
sea. Why should we not say so?"
</p><p>
<em>Ethnikos Kinks</em> of August 6, 1948 prints the report of P. Sotiropulos,
a member of the Greek Parliament, concerning the situation in the Peloponnesus, in which he says, among other things: "The Province of Aegolia
is wholly in the hands of the bandits (i.e. partisans); they have organized a
militia, a revenue department and other services, and they have established
all regular State services. Only the town of Egion remains unoccupied, and it is besieged."
</p><p>
The newspaper <em>Laiki Gnomi</em> of August 30, 1948, asked in surprise:
"How is it possible that the bandit (i.e. partisan) is able there (on the
Peloponnesus) to attack large inhabited centers, to knock at the doors of
Patras, to enter Egion...How is it possible that the almighty Markos,
defeated in the north, wins in the south? What is happening?"
