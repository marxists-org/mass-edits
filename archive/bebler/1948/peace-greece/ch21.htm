<h4>A Merry Christmas in Greece</h4>

<p class="fst">
A particularly violent wave of terror swept over Greece &#8212; as we were
informed by the whole Athens press &#8212; on Christmas day, December 25, 1947,
i.e. only three weeks after the Second Session of the General Assembly of the
United Nations had terminated its work, which is certainly not a mere coincidence. On that day the Athens police, armed to the teeth, blockaded entire
districts of Athens and blocks of houses and, according to the Greek press,
made 600 arrests.
</p><p>
It appears from the news published daily in the press that in January
(1948) 3,000 persons were arrested in Athens and the Piraeus in the course of
only three nights. On the one day of February 27, 700 persons were arrested
in Athens. In the month of February, in the village Kale, near Grevene, 160
persons were imprisoned in three days. In March the police undertook the mass
arrest of tuberculosis patients in a sanatorium under the Parnassus; during the
first week of May 1,500 persons were jailed in Athens and the Piraeus; and
during the week from May 1 to May 21, 600 more were rounded up. Early
in June several hundreds were apprehended at Kavala; in August, all inhabitants
of the village of Kolivati near Koliviroti on the Halkidic were arrested, according to Mr. Souphulis' newspaper <em>Vima</em> of August 10. During the night of
September 5-6, 600 persons were taken into custody in the Piraeus, and on
September 8-9, 875 more were arrested in Athens. Mass arrests took place early
in October at Larissa and Sparta. The police have during the last few months
continued to make many arrests, especially on the Peloponnesus in Southern
Greece. The total number of prisoners exceeds 70,000 persons.

The police forces of the Athens Government are using incredible methods
of torture against those who fall into their hands. Mrs. Brantok, the British
Labor MP, declared with regard to the information she had on these terroristic
methods: "Horrible news reaches us from Greece and shows us that Fascism
has not been destroyed by World War II, which has cost so many millions of
human lives. What is happening in Greece at present is only a repetition of the
events which rendered the triumph of Fascism in Italy and Germany possible.
The working class of the whole world must concentrate all its attention on
Greece, otherwise we shall head for a World War III." (See also the "Blue
Book" of the Provisional Greek Democratic Government, page 29).
</p><p>
Imprisonment is usually followed by deportation, summary judgment by
court-martial, or shooting without trial. The death camps", as they are called
by the Greek people, are becoming the usual place of sojourn of the democratic
inhabitants of Greece. The best known camps to which the democratic citizens
are sent, as we are told nearly every day by the Athens press, are situated on the
following islands: Makronisos (on the eastern coast of Attica), Jura, Ikari,
Samothrace, Chious, Siros, Agios Stratis. In the Makronisos camp, which is
typical, according to the Greek and world press more than 20,000 officers and
soldiers of the armed forces of the Athens Government are imprisoned for their
democratic sentiments.
