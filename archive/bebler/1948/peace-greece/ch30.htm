<h4>Travel in The Peloponnesus</h4>

<p class="fst">
The newspaper Akropolis of September 10, 1948, says that travelling
in the Peloponnesus has become a veritable military operation. This paper
says: "All automobiles travelling from one town to another, cars, trucks,
buses, are gathered together and travel in convoy protected by armored cars
and troop carriers. Light guns are ready in the turrets and machine-guns,
mortars and rifles are ready for a possible clash...A combat plane is droning
above...
</p><p>
Discussing the military situation in the Peloponnesus, the newspaper
Embros of September 29, 1948, states: "It is no longer a matter of surprise
attacks, but the bandits (i.e., partisans), are creating permanent fronts in
the vicinity of towns. We should not fear to say that before long the Peloponnesus will be lost; the Greek fortress will fall. Last year there were from
800 to 1,000 bandits (i.e., partisans) and vagabonds; now there are between
2,500 and 3,000, and their number will reach 6,000 to 7,000, if not more.
The danger is great and imminent...We must reflect that the Peloponnesus
is not empty of national forces. On the contrary, we have there forces equivalent to one army corps (shock battalions, reorganized battalions of the
National Guard, gendarmerie, municipal battalions, training units, commando
units, armored units), supported by the warships of the indefatigable Konstas
and the excellent air force of Mitilenos...
