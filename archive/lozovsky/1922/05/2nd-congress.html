<p class="c"><strong>To all organisations affiliated to the R.T.U.I.</strong></p>

<p class="fst">Dear Comrades:</p>

<p class="fst">The Central Council of the R.T.U.I. has decided to convoke the Second Congress at the end of October 1922. The Executive Bureau has fixed the date of the Congress as October 25th and the place as Moscow. According to the decision of the First Congress of Revolutionary Trade Unions (see <em>Constitution</em>, Article 4) representation is distributed as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Every National Trade Union Federation having less than 10,000 members receives one consultative voice at the Congress; national organizations having from 10,000 to 25,000 members send one delegate with a deciding vote; from 25,000 to 100,000 &ndash; two delegates with a deciding vote; from 100,000 to 250,000 &ndash; four delegates with a deciding vote; from 250,000 to 500,000 &ndash; six delegates and for each additional 500,000 members one additional delegate with a deciding vote. International revolutionary class trade or industrial organizations have two deciding votes each. Minorities organised by countries have the same representation, but all the organizations of a given country affiliated to the Red Trade Union International form a single delegation within which the votes are divided in proportion to the membership of the respective organizations. Organized minority and fractions have representation at the Congress only in case the National Trade Union Federation of that country is not affiliated to the Red Trade Union International.</p>

<p class="fst">It is thus seen that the number of votes depends in general upon the number of organized workers. Naturally the number of delegates may be more or less than the number indicated in the Constitution, if necessary, but this does not alter the number of votes.</p>

<p>The Executive Bureau has drafted the following preliminary agenda:</p>

<ol>
<li>Report of the Executive Bureau.</li>

<li>The tasks of the revolutionary trade unions and the united labor front</li>

<li>The Comintern and the Profintern.</li>

<li>Organisation problems.</li>

<li>The position of trade unions in colonial countries.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">The Executive Bureau requests all organizations affiliated to the Profintern to commence to submit amendments and additions to the agenda and, beginning with August, to said in their concrete propositions. It is understood that the final agenda will be drawn up by the Congress itself.</p>
