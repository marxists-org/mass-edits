<p class="fst">At the request of the Central Executive of the Russian Trade Unions and of numerous other organizations, as well as, because of the great preparatory work necessitated by the Congress, the Executive Bureau of the R.I.L.U. has decided to postpone the Second International Congress from the 24th of October to the 20th of November following.</p>

<p>The Executive Bureau requests all the organizations to send all detailed reports on the situation of the trade union movement and of their organizations, as well as all suggestions for the order of business, not later than the 20th of September so that all these reports and suggestions may be published in time.</p>

<p>Since there, will be held, simultaneously with the Second Congress, a series of conferences of the separate industries, it would be desirable that the delegations be composed of members of the most important federations. The norm of representation is determined by our statutes.</p>

<p>The Second International Congress of Revolutionary Trade Unions will be inaugurated in Moscow on the 20th of November. We beg to avoid all delays, since the work of the Congress will begin definitely on the set date.</p>
