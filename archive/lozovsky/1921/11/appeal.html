<p class="fst">The Executive of the Profintern (Red Trade-Union International) issues the following appeal to all the organizations, members of the Red Trade-Union International.</p>

<p class="fst">The Recruiting Week of the Red Trade-Union International will be held from the 1st to the 8th of December.</p>

<p>The revolutionary workers of all countries will manifest during this week their adherence to the Moscow International and their inflexible decision to smash the destructive system of exploitation for ever.</p>

<p>The Executive invites all organizations and workers, deserving the name of fighters for the Social Revolution, to prepare the observance of this week by the appointment of special committees of action in all revolutionary organizations accepting the Social Revolution and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. These committees are to take charge of the organization of the propaganda week as well as of the united action against the ever increasing wave of reaction.</p>

<p>The slogan of the propaganda week is, &ldquo;The united front of the proletariat against the capitalist offensive!&rdquo;</p>
