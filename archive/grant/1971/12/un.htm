<p class="fst">
The
flames of the war between India and Pakistan have highlighted the
paralysis and impotence of the United Nations as an instrument of
peace. The Security Council, composed of the two superpowers America
and Russia, and China, the giant power just installed, and Britain
and France, plus representatives of the smaller powers, was unable to
reach any agreement on what was to be done. Russia used her veto
three times. There was a threat of a veto from America and China if
resolutions not to their liking were tabled.
</p>
<p>
Since
the Second World War, there have been wars every year, and in
everyone, the United Nations has been unable to take action. The only
explanation which fits the facts is the <i>class
analysis of society</i> provided by Marxism.
Foreign policy is only the extension and continuation of home policy.
The politics of UNO are the politics of the countries which make up
the <i>dis</i>-United
Nations. It is an extension of diplomacy in a world forum.
</p>
<p>
UNO
is made up by the great imperialist powers, the smaller and medium
capitalist powers, Russia and China, the great Stalinist powers and
the smaller deformed workers&rsquo; states such as Poland and Yugoslavia.
From its makeup, it is clear that it can solve only secondary
disputes between the powers, especially when the giant powers are in
agreement to impose policies on them. But even when there is a
dispute between the smaller powers, which obtain the support of one
or other of the great powers, then agreement is impossible.
</p>
<p>
The hypocrisy
of American imperialism, which has been waging war on the Vietnamese
people for more than 6 years, in denouncing the &ldquo;aggression&rdquo; of
India on Pakistan is nauseating. Even more revolting is the spectacle
of the Chinese Stalinists, blocked until yesterday from a seat in the
United Nations by American imperialism, acting in concert with them,
acting to support the vile theocratic military police state of
Pakistan.
</p>
<p>
As
repulsive is the full support given by the bureaucratic rulers of the
Soviet Union to the capitalist landlord clique which rules India. The
war was prepared by the defence pact signed by India and Russia.
</p>
<p>
These
forays into power politics by the ruling bureaucracies of Russia and
China demonstrate how far they have abandoned the policy of Lenin, of
internationalist and class politics in the diplomacy of the Soviet
Union. The main theme of all excursions in international diplomacy by
Lenin and Trotsky was to make clear the <i>internationalist
and common class interest </i>of the working
class of the world and the perfidious and naked capitalist interest
in war and peace, of the possessing classes.
</p>
<h4>Chinese
caricature Marxism</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
arguments of the rulers of China to justify their stand, are as far
from Marxism as the Yangtse River is from the Ganges. They have
condemned Indian &ldquo;interference in the internal affairs of
Pakistan&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
10
million refugees forced to flee India is but a trifle when weighed
against the &ldquo;sacred principles of national sovereignty&rdquo;. The aid
given to the Ayub Khan regime and then that of the even more brutally
repressive rule of Yahya Khan would indicate that the clique which
rules Peking have nothing to learn from the Bourbons, in stupidity
and short-sightedness. But then what dictates their policies is the
narrow nationalist interests of the millions of bureaucrats who rule
China.
</p>
<p>
While
screaming about &ldquo;Indian aggression&rdquo;, the American government
demonstrated their love of peace by sending the 7<sup>th</sup>
fleet steaming to the Bay of Bengal. The Russians countered by
sending their warships in the same direction. These were hardly the
acts of pacifists. They were in the continuous tradition of
mailed-fist diplomacy. They were the real arguments to back up the
verbal ones at the United Nations.
</p>
<p>
This
is in line with the fact that while all the powers are swearing their
devotion to peace, they are arming relentlessly with the most
devilish weapons of destruction, nuclear, bacteriological and
chemical and their so-called &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; arming is on such a
scale as to render slight the massive arms of Hitler, Mussolini and
the Japanese militarists when they were preparing for the Second
World War.
</p>
<p>
The
arms bill for the last decade has reached the staggering figure of &pound;1
trillion! They are not piling up these arms as Christmas gifts to the
arms manufacturers, but to give weight to their struggle against each
other and against the world working class.
</p>
<p>
The
rulers of India and Pakistan, in countries where hunger is the normal
lot of the mass of the people, spend 50 percent of their national
budget on arms. As small military powers, they have just demonstrated
what the arms are for. That is why the illusion, that the paltry
amounts in comparison, spent by the FAO, the World Health
Organisation and other agencies of the United Nations demonstrate its
viability, is childish. It is like comparing the 2 pence piece flung
by a rich man to a beggar with the immense sum which he spends on
enriching himself, his family and his friends.
</p>
<p>
The
United Nations is organised by countries of capitalism, where the
vested interests of rent, interest and profit decide home and foreign
policies, including attitudes in the UN forum, and countries like
China and Russia, where landlordism and capitalism have been
abolished, but where power is in the hands of a clique of usurpers
who have taken control out of the hands of the workers and peasants.
The policies of the ruling capitalists and the attitude of the ruling
bureaucracies are dictated, in the one case by considerations of
capitalist profit, in the other by the needs of the ruling
bureaucracy. It is power, privilege, income and prestige, which
binds, and sometimes blinds, but holds together the diplomacy of the
powers, big and small.
</p>
<h4>Chinese-Russian
conflict</h4>
<p class="fst">
China
and Russia, with the same social system, which does not have the
economic drive and contradictions of capitalism, in the struggle for
markets, sources of raw materials and spheres of influence, which led
to war in the past, cannot arrive at agreement, because of the
interests of their parasitic ruling hierarchies, and oppose each
other on the world stage. How much greater then is the contradiction
between world capitalism and the Bonapartist or dictatorial workers&rsquo;
states? How much greater the antagonisms and conflicts of interests
between the capitalist powers, big and small themselves?
</p>
<p>
Britain
and France in the Security Council tried to best serve their
interests by acting as &ldquo;neutrals&rdquo; between India and Pakistan. In
reality, this was not the expression of a new-found pacifism in the
countries which attacked Egypt in 1956, but only of their weakness
and decline of influence and power in Asia.
</p>
<p>
The
deadlock in the Security Council led to the issue being taken to the
General Assembly. This, by an overwhelming majority called for a
cease-fire. No one took the slightest notice, any more than any
action was taken by Britain over Rhodesia, when the Assembly called
for her to overthrow the minority government and impose majority
rule.
</p>
<p>
From
the United Nations no world peace can be gained. In fact, it acts as
a shield for capitalist interests, and to lull the working class and
the world&rsquo;s peoples with the delusion that, through discussion by
the nations&rsquo; representatives, amicable solutions to national
conflicts can be obtained. Marxism explained long ago that it is not
who is supposed to have started a war that is important. It is, in
any case, difficult to decide nowadays, when both sides accuse the
other of starting the fighting, as in the case of India and Pakistan.
What is decisive are the causes of the conflict and what class
interests are expressed. Of course, both antagonists will pledge
fealty to defence of &ldquo;the nation&rdquo;, of &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;, of
&ldquo;freedom&rdquo;, not to forget the &ldquo;defence of peace&rdquo;. In reality,
as in the case of India and Pakistan, it is the interests of the
landlords and capitalists on both sides, which is the cause of the
war.
</p>
<p>
In
the long run, the crisis of capitalism, which is in its earliest
stages at the present time, will result in more wars and armed
conflicts. If the class struggle does not result in the overthrow of
capitalism in the main capitalist countries, it can result in the
victory of reaction and fascism. This would make a third world war
inevitable and the destruction of civilisation and even of mankind.
</p>
<h4>Eliminate
perversions of socialism</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
history of the last 50 years demonstrates conclusively that there is
no easy road to peace. The waging of the class struggle is the only
guarantee against war. The workers of all countries have the same
interests in common against the capitalist rulers. They have the same
interest in the elimination of the perversion of socialism in China
and Russia and the introduction of a workers&rsquo; socialist democracy.
</p>
<p>
The
world diplomacy of the early years of the Soviet Union was determined
by the need to make the issues of class conflict clear to the world
working class, and of the Soviet Union as representative of the
interests of the whole of the working class of the world.
</p>
<p>
On
the other hand, the dabbling in the field of world politics of the
present rulers of Russia and China has merely enhanced the power
conflicts in the world. China and Russia have armed capitalist client
states like India and Pakistan. The war between the latter two is a
war by proxy between the former. China and American imperialism
support the same policies on this issue. But in the shifting sands of
diplomacy, and power-politics alliances, agreements can change and be
reversed. In these quicksands, there cannot be found a policy leading
to socialism and peace.
</p>
<p>
The
struggle for peace is the struggle for socialism. A world federation
of socialist states is the only guarantee of peace and undreamed of
prosperity for the peoples of the world.
