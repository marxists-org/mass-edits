All workers
in the labour and trade union movement should get copies of <i>Hansard</i> [the official government publication covering the House of Commons Daily Debates] for 22<sup>nd</sup>
November, dealing with the debate on unemployment. It shows the
complete bankruptcy of the Tories, but also the failure of the Labour
leaders to provide a viable and socialist alternative to the crisis
at the present time. I shall quote extensively to demonstrate this.
</p>
<p>
What unemployment means, and the extent of the crisis was demonstrated by
the Labour MP for Bradford South in Parliament on 25<sup>th</sup>
November:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;A
week ago, the Chairman of the Yorkshire and Humberside group of the
Engineering Industries&rsquo; Association&hellip;warned that &lsquo;Unless
something was done soon, Yorkshire could become another Scotland or
North-East&rsquo;&hellip;We must all try to get the appalling unemployment
figures down&hellip;After talking with my constituents, who came here
yesterday from Bradford, I formed the very firm impression that never
again would working people in this country tolerate the long years of
degradation known to us and some of our fathers in the bad and hungry
thirties&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
There is
nothing concrete in the solutions offered. To appeal to the
government of the employers against the employers is like appealing
to Beelzebub against Satan. In the West
Midlands there is now 7.8 percent unemployment.
14 adult males are looking for every available job, in the North-West
it is 15 and in Scotland 36. In the areas of long-term unemployment,
the North-East, Ulster and Wales, the figures are similar or even
worse.
</p>
<p>
Barbara
Castle, from the opposition front bench, opening the debate on
unemployment quoted an editorial in <i>The Times</i>
declaring:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Unemployment
is at its present level quite simply as the result of a combination
of forecasting mistakes, and of a conscious policy preference for
unemployment over accelerating inflation. The trouble is we have had
both.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
After
Barber had been speaking for a while, he was interrupted by a
right-wing Labour MP:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Will
he (Barber) take back what he said about this being a political
issue, because all shades of opinion are represented in this lobby
this afternoon?&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
This
example of belly-crawling before the Conservatives was gladly taken
up by Barber:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;If
I understand the honourable gentleman aright, he is saying that this
occasion should not be made a party political matter, in which case I
agree with him.&rdquo;
</p>
<h4>Employers
invest for profit</h4>
<p class="fst">
This on the
issue of unemployment and the right to work, the most fundamental
political issue with which the working class is faced.
</p>
<p>
Barber went
on to say:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Demand
and output have on the whole been rising, but productivity has been
rising too, and indeed has been rising very fast. In the past, when
we have had a period of unusually rapid growth of productivity, it
has generally been in the context of a strong upsurge in demand and
production, but the past 12 to 18 months have, in this important
respect, been different. At a time of rather moderate growth in
production, the growth of productivity has been unusually large.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;In
fact, in the third quarter of this year output per head in the index
of production industries is provisionally estimated at 6.25 percent
higher than in the same period last year&hellip;But the concomitant of
this remarkable improvement in productivity has on this occasion been
the very large increase in unemployment.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
The blunt
truth being that the workers have worked themselves out of a job.
This shows the falsity of the argument of the Tories, which was used
by Barber:
</p>
<h4>&ldquo;The simple
truth is that people have been literally pricing themselves out of
jobs&hellip;&rdquo;</h4>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Whatever
may have happened during this past year&hellip;He [Wilson] will deny that
when he was Prime Minister, unemployment increased very considerably.
Perhaps he will tell us one day whether he planned to ensure that
unemployment at the time of the 1970 general election was at the
highest level in any June for 20 or 30 years&hellip;&rdquo; 
</p>
<p class="fst">
In reply to
the arguments of Barber, Frederick Lee, Labour MP, declared:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;I
regret it as much as anyone but any trade union which is trying to
break even for its members cannot accept an increase of less than 11
or 12 percent.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
He spoke
for a &ldquo;reasoned prices and incomes policy&hellip;&rdquo; and argued for the
Tories to abandon, in effect, Toryism! &ldquo;The government must abandon
economic policies which as a by-product produce unemployment&hellip;&rdquo;
And wagging a finger at big business: &ldquo;With all the incentives
offered now, I think it wrong that private enterprise should not be
investing&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
There is a
brutally simple answer to such whinings. <i>Employers
invest for profit</i>; if it does not pay them,
they will close down factories as easily as they close the doors of
their Rolls and Jaguars.
</p>
<p>
Enoch
Powell, the prophet of racialism and reaction, was in a theorising
mood:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;The
monetary belief, or the monetary myth, with which a whole generation
has been reared&mdash;that an injection of money into the system is the
automatic cure for unemployment&mdash;has collapsed in the face of the
experience of the past 4 or 5 years.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
That should
be the end of the delusion fostered also by the Labour leaders, that
tinkering with the economy can solve the problems of capitalism. This
illusion was still put forward in the debate, by Labour MPs, both
left and right.
</p>
<p>
The Ulster
Unionist, Mr. Onslow, declared openly and crudely:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;We
need to adjust ourselves to this situation. We might as well ask
ourselves among other things: how many unemployed graduates do we
need in our society, let alone how many can we afford? In a situation
which can best be defined, not by emotive reference to unemployment,
with all the overtones that carried from the past, but as a condition
of labour surplus, which defines it more accurately, should find it
easier to feel our way towards some answers.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
The
unemployed workers will feel better if they are told that they are
not unemployed, but surplus to requirements! Change the name of a
capitalist sewer and it will stink just as bad!
</p>
<p>
Norman
Atkinson, speaking for the <i>Tribune</i>
left, started off chauvinistically:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;I
welcome&hellip;that the government will not countenance the giving of
grants on any foreign contracts for infrastructure and work&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
However, he
put forward some demands which should be strongly supported in the
labour movement, by demanding that the trade unions have access to
the books of the employers:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;What
is happening in the capital market and in investment; who is getting
what out of the kitty, in the firm; that all this information must be
given to the unions, which will then negotiate their wage against
price maxima.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Jenkins,
for the Labour right, as usual put forward the position which the
capitalists stood for the day before yesterday:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;My
second question is to raise the much more fundamental issue of
whether the government are receding from the basic principle in the
1943 White Paper, and taking refuge in the view that if there is
severe inflation in the economy, it absolves them from their central
employment responsibility&hellip;[The government] plaintively saying that
it is nothing to do with them and it is the fault of these who drove
themselves into unemployment.&rdquo;
</p>
<h4>Jenkins has
learned nothing</h4>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;More
basic patterns of expenditure on food, clothing and fuel show very
little, if any, real growth. That is not only a cause of holding back
the economy; it is also a result of millions of people&mdash;the
old, the low paid, and the unemployed&mdash;having no
opportunity at all to increase their purchases of the necessities of
life&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
As the
Tories have jeeringly pointed out, when he was Chancellor the same
thing happened!
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;What
is the sense of proclaiming that profits are king and then failing to
get a spark of investment enthusiasm out of most of the most
profitable companies? Their doctrinaire beliefs&hellip;An uncontrolled
market economy is as incapable of producing full employment now as it
was in the thirties.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Jenkins has
learned nothing from the experience of the last Labour government,
that it is impossible to control capitalism. That so long as the big
monopolies control 85 percent of the wealth, it is their interests
which will dictate to the capitalist state and not vice-versa. That
this is so was shown by the admission of Carr in the winding-up
debate:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Therefore
if we are to discuss this subject seriously, and I believe that this
is what the country as a whole, and most of the unemployed, want,
everyone has to admit that the sort of measures of demand management
which appeared to work, and indeed did work, to control the overall
level of unemployment in the past, now seem to have lost at least
some of their previous effectiveness, or, if not their effectiveness
in the end, in total, at least something of the speed at which they
produced results, and it is worth noting that in the last year or so,
other countries have been having the same experience. In other words,
we may be entering a period when the old principles of demand
management based on Keynes and the rest may no longer be operating as
governments here of all parties, and governments in many countries,
had come to expect them, with justice, to work hitherto.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
After this
jeremiad he appealed:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;to
all boards of directors to hasten their investment decisions and have
confidence in the future. We appeal also to the trade unions to make
and press their claims with realism and responsibility.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Marxists
have explained over and over again during the last decades that it
was an illusion that so-called Keynesian measures could control the
economy. Now the fall in the rate of profit internationally is coming
together with other factors which are making for an end of the
prolonged world economic upswing which followed the last war.
</p>
<p>
The Labour
leaders would have even less success than the Tories in producing a
growth of the economy if they tried to &ldquo;control&rdquo; the basic laws
of the economy itself. The economy cannot go forward without massive
investment, at each swing of the cycle even more massive investment.
But capitalists do not invest for growth but for profit. If their
profits do not increase, there would be a &ldquo;strike of capital.&rdquo;
</p>
<h4>Four-day week
without reduction in pay</h4>
<p class="fst">
Meanwhile
the classic phenomena of capitalism are manifesting
themselves&mdash;poverty amid plenty, idle factories and idle workers,
enormous sums of idle capital but no investment. One million
unemployed workers productively employed could produce at least &pound;3 a
week extra for every family in Britain. Only 64 percent of productive
capital is being used in Britain. Used to the maximum extent, it
would mean greatly lowered hours and increased standards of living
for all, including the poor, the sick, the old, the unemployed.
</p>
<p>
One thing
stands in the way, as Karl Marx explained 100 years ago in <i>Capital</i>.
The taking-over of the means of production of wealth, the factories,
land, banks and insurance companies owned by a tiny handful, would
banish the spectre of war, unemployment and poverty. Linked to
workers&rsquo; management and control, it would mean a high standard of
living for all.
</p>
<p>
We have
given quotations from the Labour leaders, right and left. Why are
they not organising a campaign on the crisis facing capitalism?
</p>
<p>
At the
present time, the CAWU has forced a 4 day week in many factories
facing redundancy. But this has been with a reduction in pay. Why
should the workers bear the burden of capitalism&rsquo;s crisis, which
the employers and their government are responsible for? No sackings!
For a 4-day week without reduction in pay! No overtime but a sliding
scale of wages to compensate for the ever-increasing rise in prices!
