<p class="fst">Tanks, planes, guns and divisions of troops are being massed on 
  the borders of India and Pakistan. Both sides are preparing for a showdown. 
  In the uneasy relations since the partition of India, even in the border war 
  of 1965 over Kashmir, the situation has never been so tense. Ever since the 
  setting up of the capitalist-landlord state of India and the reactionary theocratic 
  state of Pakistan, with the imperialist aim of divide and rule, relations between 
  the Pakistani and Indian ruling classes has been one of embittered antagonism.</p>
<p>
  Now into this cauldron has been thrust the explosive issue of &#8216;Bangla 
  Desh&#8217;. The Punjabi capitalist-landlord clique, with the militaristic Punjabi 
  caste which controls the army, has treated East Bengal as a colony, to be bled 
  dry for the benefit of the West Pakistani overlords. 22 West Pakistani millionaire 
  families control 60 percent of industry, 80 percent of banking, and 75 percent 
  of insurance. Despite the fact that it has a bigger population, only 20 percent 
  of the revenue of the central government was spent in East Bengal. In the army 
  80 percent of the posts have gone to Punjabis. Most of the top jobs in the civil 
  service have gone to Punjabis. Officers and servicemen, principally Punjabis, 
  get the allocations of newly irrigated land.</p>
<p>
  The hungry working class, and especially the many millions of peasants, resulted 
  in a revolt against the military police dictatorship of Ayub Khan, forcing his 
  successor, Yahya Khan, to promise elections. In these the Awami League was overwhelmingly 
  successful in East Bengal, while in the West the Pakistani People&#8217;s Party 
  of Zulfikkar Bhutto gained a big majority of seats, 81 out of 119.This was eclipsed 
  by the success of the Awami League, which gained 151 seats out of 153 in the 
  constituencies of East Bengal. This gave it an actual overall majority in the 
  whole of Pakistan. They received over 75 percent of the votes in Bengal, perhaps 
  the biggest election victory in history.</p>
<p>
  This victory was gained because of the programme which was put forward by the 
  Awami League, under pressure from the workers and peasants, in order to gain 
  their support. There was no intention of carrying out such a programme, neither 
  by Mujib nor Bhutto.</p>
<p>
  The programme included: nationalisation of the banks, insurance, and heavy industry; 
  transport, shipping, and other key industries; development of Co-op enterprises, 
  workers&#8217; participation in the management of industry, and exemption from 
  land revenue tax of holdings up to eight-and-a-half acres with cancellation 
  of tax arrears on such holdings. Fundamental rights should be guaranteed by 
  the constitution and should be limited only in wartime. Pakistan should pursue 
  an independent foreign policy, and should withdraw from SEATO, CENTO, and other 
  military pacts. Bhutto&#8217;s party put forward similar demagogic demands. 
  But, as Bhutto explained to the international capitalist press on December 11th 
  last year, he was &#8220;A Democratic Socialist who believed in Socialism on 
  the Willy Brandt or British pattern&#8221;. At the same time Bhutto put forward 
  the demand for a confrontation with India over Kashmir, calling for a &#8220;&#8230;thousand 
  year war if necessary&#8221;.</p>
<p>
  The Awami League put forward demands which would have meant the virtual separation 
  of the two wings of Pakistan:</p>
<ol class="numbered">
	<li>Federal form of government.</li>
	<li>Federal control only of defence and foreign policy.</li>
	<li>Two separate freely convertible currencies, separate banking reserve, separate 
  fiscal and monetary policies.</li>
	<li>The exclusive authority of the two wings to levy taxation.</li>
	<li>Separate external trade accounts.</li>
	<li>A militia or Para-military force, an ordnance factory, a military academy 
  and navy headquarters in East Pakistan.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  This could not possibly be accepted by the capitalist-landlord clique in control. 
  The crushing victory of the Awami League gave them no room to manoeuvre between 
  the two parties as Yahya Khan had intended. Consequently this military dictator 
  fought for time. He pretended to negotiate with Sheikh Mujib Rahman while pouring 
  troops and war material by sea, and with the assistance of Maoist China, by 
  air, into East Bengal. Instead of mobilising the workers and peasants (indeed 
  almost the entire population of East Bengal could have been organised for the 
  struggle), Mujib took the negotiations at face value. The judges, police, civil 
  servants and Bengali troops struck together with the workers and peasants after 
  martial law had been proclaimed on March 1st. A general strike in Dacca and 
  East Pakistan was proclaimed on March 2nd. At the election rally to celebrate 
  the victory in Dacca there had been a demonstration of 2 million workers, students, 
  peasants and professional people.</p>
<h4>1.5 million killed</h4>
<p class="fst">
  Now in the face of brutal repression they were temporarily disorganised. The 
  military clique thought that with bloody repression they would soon cow the 
  Bengali people. Instead an implacable guerrilla war has been organised which 
  has resulted in economic life being reduced to a low level. One and a half million 
  people have been killed by Yahya&#8217;s troops and bands of thugs and thieves, 
  the &#8216;Kazakars&#8217;, armed by the Pakistan army. Ten million people have 
  fled to West Bengal and other border states of India. An endless war of attrition 
  has begun. Instead of economic advantage, the Eastern wing has become a drain 
  on the resources of the West Pakistan oligarchy.</p>
<p>
  However, the hypocritical horror of the Indian ruling class at the national 
  suppression of East Bengali people is shown by the suppression in Kashmir, whish 
  has not reached the scale of the bloody terror of the West Pakistanis, but is 
  still monstrously suppressive. They banned the Plebiscite Front, arrested Sheik 
  Abdullah the leader of the Kashmiris, and put forward a Preventive Detention 
  Act in Kashmir worse than South Africa&#8217;s which allows ten years preventive 
  detention without trial. The Kashmiri majority of Muslims have been terrorised 
  into submission.</p>
<p>
  For the industries of West Pakistan, East Bengal has been used as a source of 
  raw materials, a market, and, mainly through jute exports, as a source of foreign 
  exchange &#8211; the classical position of a colony. The lion&#8217;s share 
  of the foreign exchange and all the resources are used for investment in West 
  Pakistan, principally the Punjab. Consequently the Bengalis are impoverished 
  and have about half the standard of living of the already low standard of the 
  West Pakistanis. The average income is about &pound;20 a year for those lucky 
  enough to have a job in industry or on the land. Many millions are landless 
  or unemployed.</p>
<p>
  The attempt of Yahya Khan and the Punjab caste to &#8216;play the Muslim-Hindu 
  card&#8217; has failed utterly. Communalism has failed to gain support among 
  the Bengali people. The burning of villages, wholesale rape, torture and executions 
  in the towns and villages of East Pakistan have failed to achieve their purpose. 
  They have only succeeded in inculcating an undying hatred of their overlords 
  among the Bengali people.</p>
<h4>30 million unemployed in India</h4>
<p class="fst">
  But the Punjabi military overlords are riding the tiger of repression, and cannot 
  dismount. They are afraid of the repercussions in West Pakistan of even a modest 
  measure of autonomy in the East. Autonomy would inevitably lead to separation 
  with the prevailing mood of the Bengalis. West Pakistan could not hold together 
  under these conditions. The Sindhis, Baluchis and the people of the North West 
  Frontier Province would demand autonomy. The Punjabi people too are seething 
  with unrest under the tyranny of the big business military government. Consequently, 
  defeat in Bengal would be the beginning of the end for the rapacious ruling 
  class of West Pakistan. They would prefer war rather than voluntarily evacuate, 
  despite their untenable position in East Bengal.</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, India, before the arrival of the refugees, had over 30 million 
  unemployed. The economy of the capitalist-landlord sub-continent of India cannot 
  absorb the refugees or even allow them to work for their keep. It is costing 
  India over &pound;600 million a year &#8211; truly a nightmare to the Indian 
  capitalists. The aid which has been sent by the developed nations, mainly America 
  and Britain, covers only a fraction of the cost. To India it is the cost of 
  a small war. Moreover, they are faced with the pressure from the Bengali people 
  in West Bengal, who speak the same language and are part of the same people 
  as in the East.</p>
<p>
  The Indian capitalist-landlord economy cannot stand the strain of the 10 million 
  refugees indefinitely; consequently they demand that these be enabled to return 
  &#8216;soon&#8217;. It is these contradictions that are forcing India and Pakistan 
  into a confrontation.</p>
<p>
  Neither India nor Pakistan can wait for years until the guerrilla pressure forces 
  collapse in the East and explosion in the West of Pakistan. In any case, both 
  sides calculate that this would be even more dangerous for them than a war. 
  The border war of 1965 relieved pressure socially, albeit for a very temporary 
  period. But a war now would no longer be a border war, but an all-out war.</p>
<p>
  In this situation the imperialist countries are coldly calculating the balance 
  of advantage to themselves. The American and British governments, behind the 
  scenes, are exerting pressure to &#8216;compromise&#8217;. But, beyond establishing 
  a puppet regime in East Pakistan, the ruling class in West Pakistan cannot withdraw 
  their troops from the area without provoking, in the immediate future, collapse 
  in the West of the country. It is easy for the capitalist powers to see the 
  advantage of withdrawal, after making preparations for an armed force to be 
  established to hold down the workers and peasants of Bangla Desh. But, for the 
  West Pakistanis, the fate of the military-industrial-landlord clique is at stake.</p>
<p>
  It is ironical that in this situation the contestants of India and Pakistan 
  should turn to the so-called &#8216;socialist&#8217; states for support. India 
  has signed an agreement with Russia for the supply of arms and &#8216;support 
  against the aggression of a third party&#8217;. The British &#8216;Communist&#8217; 
  Party reports as news items the positions of China and Russia without comment. 
  Mr Chi (Chinese Foreign Minister) said: &#8220;Our Pakistan friends may rest 
  assured that, should Pakistan be subjected to foreign aggression, the Chinese 
  Government and people will, as always, resolutely support the Pakistan Government 
  and people in their just struggle to defend their state, sovereignty, and national 
  independence&#8221;. (Morning Star, 8th November 1971). Thus the bloody butcher 
  Yahya Khan is supported in his war against Bengali people by the Chinese Stalinists.</p>
<p>
  On November 4th, also as a news item, the Morning Star reports: &#8220;India&#8217;s 
  people must be prepared to face the possibility of war with Yahya Khan&#8217;s 
  military regime in West Pakistan, the Communist Party of India warned here.&#8221; 
  They detail demands they would make on India&#8217;s regime and the various 
  struggles of the Indian workers, including a general strike in West Bengal. 
  But as the quotation indicates, they will give uncritical support to the war 
  of the Indian ruling class.</p>
<p>
  The Indian capitalist parties, from the ruling Congress to the reactionary and 
  communalist Jan Sangh, are all screaming for war. Both Indian Communist Parties 
  have joined in the patriotic uproar. Marxists in the Labour Movement in Britain 
  and all over the world will determine their attitude towards such a war by the 
  class interests involved. For Pakistan it will clearly be an unjust and reactionary 
  war for the purpose of holding down the peoples of East and West Pakistan. It 
  is of no fundamental importance who starts the war, or in the current parlance, 
  who is the &#8216;aggressor&#8217;. For workers the issue should be: In whose 
  interests is the war being waged? What class interests are being served?</p>
<p>
  For the masses of India and Pakistan, already half-starved, the war can only 
  mean worse hunger, misery and starvation. The aims of the Indian ruling class 
  are no less reactionary than those of the Pakistanis. They intend to put back 
  in power the Bengali landlords and capitalists of Bangla Desh. War could lead 
  to a military police state in India. Thus the working class must take up a position 
  independent of the capitalist powers involved. The Bengali workers and peasants 
  must fight for a united socialist Bengal, as a step towards a democratic federation 
  of socialist states on the sub-continent.
