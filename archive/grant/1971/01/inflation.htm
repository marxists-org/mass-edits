The
Tory government and the capitalist press, TV, and radio have been
conducting a tireless and incessant campaign on the question of
inflation blaming the trade union movement and the working class for
the continuous rise in prices. It is the &ldquo;greed&rdquo;, &ldquo;selfishness&rdquo;
and &ldquo;hooliganism&rdquo; of the workers in demanding wage increases up
to 30 percent which is responsible for the economic plight of the
country! The constant refrain is blared out &ldquo;if wages go up, prices
go up, everybody including the people who get higher wages are worse
off, and the old age pensioners, widows, and the sick are in dire
distress.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
What
is the truth of the matter? The nauseating hypocrisy of the
commentators and Conservative ministers weeping crocodile tears at
the plight of these people is only equalled by their stony-hearted
refusal to take any measures to alleviate their condition. But what
causes price increases? If the capitalists could arbitrarily raise
prices they would not wait for wages to rise. They are interested in
gaining the maximum, profits. What stops them is competition,
especially under modern conditions, nationally and internationally.
In fact in general it is wages which lag behind prices and not
vice-versa.
</p>
<p>
If
the capitalists could raise prices at their whim, why do they face
the prospect of bitter strikes, with consequent loss of production
and profits rather than concede the wage demands of the workers? If
it was simply a question of passing on wage increases that would be
the obvious way to solve the problem. <i>But in
fact the profit of the capitalist class is only the unpaid labour of
the working class</i>. Consequently an increase
of wages for the workers, other things being equal, means a fall in
the profit of the capitalists. Hence the cries of woe from the paid
hacks of capitalism in the mass media.
</p>
<p>
The
screams of anguish by the Tory MPs and the clamour of the CBI against
&ldquo;unproductive&rdquo; and &ldquo;parasitic&rdquo; state expenditure arises from
the fact that the money &ldquo;spent&rdquo; by the state can only be raised
from taxation which either comes from the pockets of the workers or
the pockets of the capitalists. By saving on such &ldquo;wasteful&rdquo;
things as the social services more money can be syphoned off in the
interests of big business.
</p>
<p>
The
expenditure of the GNP by the state has increased from 37 percent in
1957 to 50 percent in 1969; this at a time, when at best the economy
has been only slowly increasing. Hence the programme of the Tories
ruthlessly to slash at the reforms of the post-war period at the
expense of the working class and the very sections &ldquo;defended&rdquo; so
zealously by the capitalist press and other organs of mass opinion,
to their vociferous applause.
</p>
<p>
The
capitalists can only make a surplus from the labour they employ. What
Marx calls constant capital is the investment in machinery,
buildings, raw materials and so on. This is &ldquo;dead labour&rdquo; which
passes unchanged in the final product. With the development of
technique, more and more has to be invested to exploit relatively
less and less labour. Consequently in spite of the increase in
exploitation and the increased amount extracted from the workers
there is a tendency for the rate of profit to fall. This year ICI,
Fords, Courtaulds and many other giant firms have reported an actual
fall in the amount of profit, despite in many cases an increase of
investment.
</p>
<p>
Consequently
they wish to increase their profits by squeezing the workers, by
increasing productivity, by more intensive labour and getting the
Tory government to help them resist wage increases, and introduce
anti-trade union laws to hamper and restrict the struggle of the
workers for a better standard of living.
</p>
<h4>&ldquo;Fictitious
capital&rdquo;</h4>
<p class="fst">
One
of the main causes of the continuous fall in the purchasing power of
the currency in Britain as in other capitalist countries is the
&ldquo;inflated&rdquo; expenditure on armaments which in Britain consumes
more than &pound;2,500 million. The workers in the Forces and armaments
industry have to eat, live in houses, procreate, have recreation and
all the normal activities of the working class. The capitalists in
these industries have to make the average rate of profit, if not
more. The expenditure is entirely unproductive, producing neither
consumer nor capital goods. Consequently it has to come out of the
production of society as a whole. Hence the undermining of the
currency. At the same time the national debt which has now reached
the astronomical sum of &pound;1,200 million to &pound;1,400 million in payment
for armaments destroyed in imperialism&rsquo;s wars over the course of
the last century, constitutes an enormous and parasitic drain on the
economy.
</p>
<p>
Britain
is not one special case. Inflation is rife throughout the capitalist
world. It is aggravated in its consequences in Britain by the
sluggishness of the economy due to the sickness of capitalism.
</p>
<p>
To
cope with the price increases the workers in all these countries have
demanded higher rates of pay. In the United States, despite massive
increases in unemployment, many sections of the workers have won big
increases ranging upwards from 14 percent. Wages in the Common Market
countries will have increased by 14 percent this year, the highest
increases for 12 years. In Italy wages increased by 18 percent and
West Germany 15 percent.
</p>
<p>
In
the past, one of the main arguments of the capitalist class and its
publicists has been the low wages of their competitors, especially in
Western Europe. Now Britain, because of the relative economic
stagnation, is rapidly becoming a country of cheap labour, by
comparison. The argument is still trotted out in the capitalist
press, and the other means of publicity in the hands of the ruling
class, that the employers cannot afford higher wages because of
international competition. But, it is the failure of the capitalists
to invest the surplus extracted from the workers that is the real
root of the problem. But capitalists will only invest if they can
make an extra profit. Consequently the potential of British science
and technique has not been applied, and Britain, once the leading
industrial nation, faces the very real threat of becoming an economic
and industrial backwater in comparison with her rivals.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
the measures of the government, like those of the former Labour
government, restrict the market by taxes on the workers and the
&ldquo;economic and monetary squeeze&rdquo;. This, plus low wages, gives no
&ldquo;incentive&rdquo; to the capitalists to invest. This in turn becomes a
vicious circle. The struggle of the trade union movement for higher
wages can force the capitalists to invest in more machinery in order
to economise on labour. Limiting wages merely results in
super-profits for the capitalists.
</p>
<p>
The
present economic upswing is the &ldquo;best&rdquo; period in which the
workers can improve their standard of living. Consequently the
exhortations throughout the capitalist world from Norway to America
by the bankers and industrialists and echoing them the governments,
advocating prices and incomes policies or monetary squeezes, or a
&ldquo;firm stand&rdquo; by governments and employers against what they term
&ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; wage demands. They try and find a &ldquo;solution&rdquo;
to the capitalist inflationary sickness at the expense of the
workers.
</p>
<p>
In
America this disease has manifested itself in rising unemployment,
falling or stagnant production and rising prices. The attempt to
tinker with the economy on the advice of the capitalist economist
witchdoctors has had this unprecedented result.
</p>
<p>
Keynesianism,
the bible of the Labour leaders, (and a philosophy of inflation) has
been completely discredited: the endeavours to operate on its
precepts in Britain and America have been total failures. And now,
the so-called &ldquo;monetary&rdquo; methods have had the results sketched
out above. They take the elementary proposition that a given amount
of currency would be necessary to move a given quantity of goods in a
capitalist economy, at a fixed velocity of money, and that if under
these circumstances, for example, the amount of currency notes were
to be doubled, prices would also double. They then come to the
conclusion that in a situation of inflation if the &ldquo;money supply&rdquo;,
i.e. the issue of notes and credit, is cut down this would result in
a proportionate fall in prices, or at the least stop the steady
inflation of prices. They imagine that removing the symptom will cure
the disease. In reality the fictitious capital engendered by
armaments production, the rigging of the stock exchange, the phoney
issuance of shares without real capital, buildings and machinery to
back it, the waste of the Vietnam War, etc., are the cause of
inflation in America and elsewhere. It is impossible to remove
inflation without eradicating the causes: consequently the attempt at
a monetary squeeze in America has meant many bankruptcies,
unemployment and rising prices. Inflation continues to mount.
Industrial production has remained stationary or has dropped. In
Britain the monetary squeeze, and the prices and incomes policy,
resulted in high profits, an economic stop, low investment and rising
prices.
</p>
<h4>Take over
monopolies</h4>
<p class="fst">
Production
is now painfully increasing at the rate of 2 to 3 percent in Britain.
Capital investment is increasing equally lethargically. In America
too, new investment has dropped to 2 percent! Unemployment in Britain
has reached over 650,000 while prices are rising steeply. Even
according to the official index, the cost of living has increased by
8 percent! Thus a tight monetary policy has meant low production,
increased unemployment and higher prices.
</p>
<p>
The
disease of the system is to be &ldquo;alleviated&rdquo; at the expense of the
working class. But the organic sickness of capitalism, even if
successful in this operation, would not be cured. It is the
irrationality of production for profit and not for the benefit of the
producers that is the cause of all the difficulties of the system
nationally and internationally. The fight of the working class
against the anti-union bill and against the social service cuts for a
minimum wage of &pound;20 a week, with the modest wage increases demanded
by the workers with a sliding scale of wages to compensate for
increased prices and lower hours to absorb the unemployed: these are
minimum demands.
</p>
<p>
The
long term solution is not a new disastrous prices and incomes policy
for the next Labour government as advocated by Lord George-Brown, and
hinted at by Roy Jenkins and Barbara Castle, which will have the same
results as the last versions of this policy, but a break with
capitalism and capitalist policies. The nationalisation of the
&ldquo;commanding heights&rdquo; of the economy with minimum compensation on
the basis of need must be the programme of the labour movement.
</p>
<p>
Despite pleas
of poverty by the capitalists, Britain still remains one of the
wealthiest countries in the world. &pound;120,000 million is the estimated
total. Britain has the machinery, the science, the technique and the
skill of the working class which could be harnessed and used for the
production of abundance and decent standards for all. The only answer
is the organisation and management of the economy by the working
class in the interests of the working class.
