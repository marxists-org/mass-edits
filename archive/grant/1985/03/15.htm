<p>With deep regret, we have to inform the readers of <em>Militant</em> 
  of the death of George MacDonald. A member of the Canadian Communist Party from 
  an early age, George joined the Trotskyist movement in 1933 after the victory 
  of Hitler. The criminal failure of the German Communist Party, on the instructions 
  of Stalin, to organise a united front with the Social Democrats to stop Hitler 
  from coming to power played a fatal role. This disastrous policy was supported 
  by all the other Communist parties, that of Canada included, despite the repeated 
  appeals for a united front made by Trotsky and the International Left Opposition.</p>

<p> This betrayal, ending in the destruction of the mighty German labour movement, 
  made an enormous impression on George. He had understood from a reading of Trotsky's 
  writings that this would inevitably result in war on the Soviet Union. A leading 
  activist in the Trotskyist movement, George became unemployed in the world recession 
  before the war. He volunteered for the Canadian army, like many unemployed workers 
  in Britain and Canada today.</p>

<p> He was amongst the first contingents of Canadian troops to be sent to Britain 
  in 1940. He immediately contacted the Trotskyists when he was on leave. Their 
  headquarters were in a small loft in Northdown Street, Kings Cross, London. 
  I met George there and formed a firm friendship, politically and personally. 
  He maintained his connection with the Marxist movement in Britain. Throughout 
  the dark days of the 1950s and 1960s, George never lost heart, always maintaining 
  his faith in the working class and in socialism.</p>

<p> In the last months, he enthusiastically followed the miners' strike. Ill and 
  house-bound, George's interest in the workers' movement never dimmed for an 
  instant. He was an enthusiastic supporter and reader of <em>Militant</em>.</p>

<p> Those of us who knew George will remember him as a gentle and considerate 
  person. The harsh and bitter realities of life under capitalism left no trace 
  upon this side of his character. The many comrades he helped during his lifetime 
  can testify to his unshrinking kindness. Despite all the setbacks and difficulties, 
  his faith in the socialist future of mankind remained undimmed until the end.</p>


<p> George MacDonald left all he possesses to <em>Militant</em>. 
  He skimped himself to try and leave as much as possible to continue the fight 
  for socialism. It is with emotion that we bid farewell to an old soldier in 
  the cause of the socialist revolution. The torch he has dropped will be picked 
  up and carried by the young supporters of <em>Militant</em>. 
  If they remain as faithful to the ideas of Marxism as old George, the future 
  of socialism will be assured. </p>
