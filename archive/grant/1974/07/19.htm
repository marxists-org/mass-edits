<p class="fst">Throughout capitalist Europe the idea of &quot;workers' control&quot; or
&quot;industrial democracy&quot; is being widely discussed both inside the
Labour Movement and inside the pages of the capitalist press. This
is no accident.</p>

<p>It is partly a response to the growing militancy of the Labour
Movement expressed in the events of May 1968 in France, the miners'
strikes in Britain in 1972 and 1974, the general strikes in Italy
and Denmark and the wave of unofficial strikes in West Germany.</p>

<p>The strategists of capital are increasingly looking for ways to
contain these movements through schemes of &quot;social partnership&quot;. At
the same time by involving and incorporating the efforts of workers
both in the office and on the shop floor in the process, the
employing class hope to actually increase efficiency and therefore
the level of profits.</p>

<p>Any good shop steward knows the sheer waste of production and
sheer stupidity exercised by the &quot;whizz kids&quot; of management. Only
by the co-operation of the workers can productivity be raised.</p>

<p>So it is no surprise that the more far-sighted employers now
support the idea of &quot;workers' participation&quot; or, as it has been
called in the past &quot;joint consultation&quot;. As early as 1927 in
Britain, Sir Alfred Mond of ICI, the big chemical monopoly, sought
to create &quot;works councils&quot;.</p>

<p>His aim was clear. They were to provide management with
information and suggestions from the workforce, to get management
instructions over to the workforce, and to guide workers'
aspirations to &quot;have a say&quot; into safe channels.</p>

<p>In other words, they were powerless committees in which workers
could let off steam. They aimed to embroil workers' leaders into
positions where they would take the responsibility for decisions
which were really those of management. At the same time this would
give the illusion that the workers had an influence in
decision-making in order to avoid the workers and their own
organisations taking independent action.</p>

<p>This is a crucial point. From the earliest days of these schemes
the employers have attempted to use &quot;works councils&quot; as a means of
weakening the trade unions in the factories.</p>

<p>They try to counterpose &quot;works councils&quot; (like company unions in
the big banks at the moment) to the real organisations of the
workers. That is, independent trade unions and shopfloor
organisations built through struggle against the most
&quot;participatory&quot; managements.</p>

<p>Even the capitalist experts in industrial Relations now admit
the truth. As the Industrial Welfare Society put it: &quot;The general
impression gained is that the majority of firms do not fully
believe in, and practice, formal consultation and all that it
implies, but use it rather as a forum for company pronouncements
and the airing of employee irritants.&quot;</p>

<p>But it is still the case that these councils continue to exist
in their original form, especially in the Civil Service and the
nationalised industries.</p>


<h4>&quot;Worker directors&quot;</h4>

<p>The capitalist idea of &quot;workers' participation&quot; has now been
extended to the idea of &quot;worker directors&quot; on the board of the
company, under certain conditions. The CBI has been pleasantly
surprised at the &quot;success&quot; of worker directors in the British Steel
Corporation! This is not so surprising when you read the comments
of these &pound;10,000 a year worker directors as reported in the
<em>Sunday Times</em> (November 7, 1971):</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;Of course we are not really directors at all...We don't have
anything to do with policy&quot;.</p>

<p class="quote"><em>&quot;I see myself as an ordinary manager too; not as a
worker&quot;.</em></p>

<p class="quote">&quot;A tub-thumping shop steward on the board would be disastrous.
We have to be free to take management's side if we think it is
right&quot;.</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;I feel unofficial strikes are never justified&quot;.</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;I am a socialist, but not your Michael Foot type. I am more of
a Jenkins man; Roy, of course &#8212; not Clive&quot;. <sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p class="fst">Clearly &quot;workers' participation&quot; will bring nothing to workers
in industry if it means no more than worker-directors like those in
British Steel, which the TUC recommended to the Donovan Commission
on trade unions in 1968.</p>

<p>In general the attitude of the trade union leaders is not clear.
Jack Jones, in 1970 wrote a pamphlet; &quot;The Right to Participate:
key to Industrial Progress&quot; in which he advocated a form of
&quot;representative participation&quot; where &quot;managers and stewards would
act in co-operation.&quot; <sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Such vague pronouncements seem to deny the very existence of
class conflict on the factory floor, and Jack Jones went no further
than to support the reforms in ICI where the shop stewards took
over the role of the employee representatives in works
councils.</p>

<p>In the last six months, the CBI has published a report on
employee participation, and both the TUC and the Labour Party have
come forward with new proposals.</p>

<p>All the ideas expressed in these pamphlets revolve around the
system introduced in West Germany known as &quot;co-determination&quot;.
Under this scheme, workers elect one third or one half of the
members of a supervisory board which directs general policy and
appoints a management board underneath it to run things from day to
day. In West Germany, until this year, only mining and steel had
one half of the board, and the right to elect directly from the
trade unions <em>some</em> of the members, instead of from the
employees as a whole. The rest of industry has no direct trade
union representation and only one-third representation on the
boards.</p>

<p>Now the CBI is prepared to support such proposals in Britain.
This is not surprising when it is remembered that the works council
within this system has no right to call strikes and it by-passes
the Trade Union organisation.</p>

<p>The Labour Party NEC Report put it [this way] in 1967:
<p class="quote">&quot;Wherever
co-determination brings members of works councils still more
closely together with management, a new stratum of industrial
functionaries to some extent sharing management prerogatives makes
its appearance...a privileged upper stratum of the working
class&quot;.</p>

<p class="fst">Even an official German report on the workings of
&quot;co-determination&quot; admitted &quot;the individual employee usually feels
hardly at all directly effected by its procedures. Though he is
able to put forward complaints and suggestions and some information
of vital concern is given to him regularly, he has little chance to
play an active part in shaping relations at his own workplace&quot;. In
other words &#8212; nothing has changed since Sir Alfred Mond!</p>

<p>Therefore it is disappointing that both the TUC and the Labour
Party should see a move to &quot;workers' control&quot; in these schemes. The
TUC Report on Industrial Democracy wants the German scheme
initially for firms with over 2000 employees, but with 50%
representation elected by the trade unions alone.</p>

<p>This is the main advance that the Labour Party Green Paper &quot;The
Community and the Company&quot; also advocates. As the Green Paper
remarks, &quot;The dualism of workers representation by trade unions and
works councils, enables the employers to play off the works'
councils against the trade unions&quot;.</p>

<p>The Times found this proposal, &quot;offensive to logic&quot; and
&quot;practically absurd&quot; for &quot;members of the board need to be
responsible for their actions to some interest within the company&quot;
and not &quot;outside bodies&quot; like the trade unions! As if shareholders
and the bankers on the company boards were not also &quot;outsiders&quot; as
far as the workers are concerned!</p>

<p>But are the TUC and Labour Party proposals really a step towards
workers' control? The Green Paper itself says that workers' control
is impracticable while the private sector continues to exist!! But
it does not conclude from this that the private sector should be
taken into public ownership.</p>

<p>And why only 50% of the board? This is not answered in the Green
Paper. What happens if there is a tied vote between management and
unions on the board? The Green Paper has no answer but to take up
the idea of a &quot;neutrally appointed&quot; chairman who will make the
casting vote!</p>

<p>As it is, the Trade Union directors would have to recognise that
&quot;even their right to report back to their workers would no doubt
have limits in respect of trade secrets, the dissemination of which
could injure the company's competitive position&quot;.</p>

<p>It is not the job of the trade unions to protect the profit
advantage of any individual company but to fight for improvements
in the conditions of the workers as a whole and for the Labour
Movement to bring an end to the private profit system
altogether.</p>

<p>The employers and some right-wing members of the Labour Party
are much clearer than the authors of these documents on the
difference between &quot;participation&quot; and &quot;control&quot;. As John
Stonehouse, MP for Walsall North, put it:</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;We must establish a
clear distinction between workers' participation and workers'
control. The former is acceptable; the latter is not... the
experience in co-operative management has shown that management
expertise is a somewhat rare attribute which cannot be developed in
every Tom, Dick and Harry&quot;.</p>

<p class="fst">This contemptuous attitude towards the abilities of working
people flies in the face of the reality on the shop floor. The
abilities of workers to manage have been shown not only in the
stream of ideas that used to come to management through their
&quot;suggestion boxes&quot;, but also the power of shop stewards to organise
the work of his section or line and the ability to produce work in
the best way possible.</p>

<p>Already there is the <em>embryo</em> of workers' control in this
shop floor power, but it is restricted, limited, and even stunted
in its extent by the power of management and their inefficiency and
the demands of the capitalist system itself.</p>

<p>In fact it is not in the interests of the workers to take
responsibility for the organisation of production without real
control over the policy decisions in a plant or company. Every
worker can understand the story that Joe Ashton MP recounted in
<em>Labour Weekly</em> (June 28, 1974) of his first job in a Sheffield
factory when he was full of enthusiasm and bright ideas. He found a
way of doing a job at twice the speed. He was ticked off by his
work- mates and told to slow down. He took no notice and was
praised by management for his efficiency.</p>

<p>Next day the rate fixer presented him with a new card which cut
the price of each job by half as he now produced it in half the
time! Result: no increase in wages, but an increase in profits. So
ended &quot;workers' participation&quot; for Joe Ashton and thousands of
workers like him who have experienced the same thing!</p>

<p>Real workers' control means what it says: control by the workers
over the day-to-day activities of a company or plant, so that the
decisions of management and employers are continually checked and
altered if necessary by the workers. It means that the workers can
check the ingoings and outgoings of material and labour, that they
have access to the books of the company, knowledge and control over
investment decisions etc. It is this power which is really
jealously guarded by the capitalist class for good reason.</p>

<p>As Lenin said:</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;The law safe-guarding commercial secrets serves
here not the requirements of production of exchange but of
speculation and enrichment in its crudest from. It aids direct
swindle which, as is well known, is particularly widespread in
joint stock companies and is most clearly concealed by accounts and
balance sheets so contrived as to fool the public... This secret
means safeguarding the privileges and profits of literally a
handful of people against the whole people&quot;.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not good enough to have information which the company sees
fit to give. Real workers' control means the exposure of the
scandals and swindles going on in the boardrooms of the rich.</p>

<p>The Labour Party Green Paper cites plenty of these: Lonrho &quot;the
unpleasant and unacceptable face of capitalism&quot;; Distillers and
Thalidomide compensation, &quot;inside share dealing &quot;and &quot;asset
stripping&quot;. These are all &quot;trade secrets&quot;' as far as the employers
are concerned and they will expect worker-directors not to expose
them under the law.</p>

<p>The Labour Party proposals to disclose company information on
directors holdings and fees, wages and employment in all plants,
share transactions with other companies etc. would be a great step
forward but would so threaten the basis of capitalist commerce that
the Labour Movement would either back down in the face of the
employers' resistance or go forward to full- workers' control of
companies.</p>

<p>That would mean the mobilisation of workers' organisations to
take control of the offices and factories and therefore dictate to
managers what to do. And as Trotsky put it: &quot;This leads squarely to
the question of the governmental administration of industry; i.e.
to the expropriation of the capitalists by a workers' government.
Workers' control, in this way, is not a prolonged 'normal
condition', like wage scale agreements or social insurance. The
control is a transitional measure, under the conditions of the
highest tension of the class war and is conceivable only as a
bridge to the revolutionary nationalisation of industry.&quot;</p>


<h4>Occupations</h4>

<p>In this light the positive and negative elements in the
experience of the sit-ins and occupations in which workers
internationally have engaged in the recent past can be analysed.
Above all, the experience of the occupation of the workers at the
Lip watch factory in Besan&ccedil;on, France, or the UCS workers,
showed that workers can run industry, pay their own wages without a
boardroom full of capitalists.</p>

<p>But such action is limited while it remains isolated from the
general struggle for a socialist transformation of the economy.</p>

<p><em>While workers control develops from below, from the shop
floor through the plant upwards, workers' management develops from
above, and is only meaningful in terms of a socialist planned
economy, with the monopolies nationalised.</em></p>

<p>The control of one or even several factories as happened in
Spain in 1936 or in Chile in 1972-3 does not mean the end of
capitalism or the capitalist state. Inevitably, while the
capitalists remain in overall control of the economy, workers'
control cannot be permanently maintained.</p>

<p>Both the Lip and UCS workers had to reach a compromise
re-establishing control in the hands of the capitalists, in which
even the right to work was not achieved for all employees.</p>

<p>Even the workers' co-operative which is to be set up with
Government subsidy in the wake of the struggle at Triumph Meriden
is several steps short of workers' control.</p>

<p>The workforce has been drastically reduced along with wages. The
co-operative will only deal with production, while sales and
marketing will remain in the hands of the Norton Villiers
employers. And of course, there is no guarantee that if the venture
fails to make a profit even after the massive subsidies that the
employers will not still close down the supply, sales and credit
facilities. The Fisher Bendix workers now face redundancy again
despite the courageous occupation to preserve their jobs two years
ago.</p>

<p>As the Lip workers said at the time of their own fight: &quot;We
didn't want to fall into the trap of a workers 'co-operative' for
if it failed because of isolation we would have been denounced for
our 'bad workers' management'... you can't say that capitalism will
ever accept an 'island of greenery' in its midst&quot;. Without workers'
management of the economy, workers' control of the factories cannot
be maintained for any length of time.</p>


<h4>Workers' management</h4>

<p>In this sense the demand for workers' control is only a
transitional demand to be taken up by workers in struggle as part
of the programme for the complete socialist transformation of
society. It is not a sole or ultimate demand made by socialists as
some tendencies in the Labour Movement imagine.</p>

<p>While workers' control develops from below, from the shop floor
through the plant upwards, workers' management develops from above
and is only meaningful in terms of a socialist planned economy,
with the monopolies nationalised.</p>

<p>It means management by the workers of the overall plan of the
economy, making the general investment decisions and plans for
growth to meet the needs of the people. Socialists are not
syndicalists who believe that control of individual plants or
industries by the workers in them can guarantee the harmonious
running of industry without overall management of the economy by
the workers as a whole.</p>

<p>This means that ownership of industry cannot remain in the hands
of the capitalists. Only public ownership of the major monopolies
would guarantee workers' management and workers' control in the
individual plants. Workers would develop new forms of organisation
to manage the economy, probably similar to the workers' councils or
Soviets that sprang up in Russia in 1917.</p>

<p>These workers' councils would involve all sections of the
working class including tenants, housewives, students and old age
pensioners as well as the industrial trade union organisations of
the workers. Regular elections of delegates, subject to immediate
recall, and officials tied to the average wage of a skilled worker
would safeguard the workers from the growth of a bureaucracy of
officialdom usurping power. These safeguards were first laid down
by the workers of the Paris Commune and taken up by Lenin and the
Bolsheviks in 1917.</p>

<p>In Britain, the nationalised sector of industry is managed
bureaucratically by many of the former capitalist owners of the
industries or by retired colonels etc, at massive salaries.</p>

<p>The only workers' control within these enterprises is that
developed by the shop floor workers themselves against the
management. It is the supreme irony that the main argument that the
Tory leaders are now using against Labour's plans for further
nationalisation is that workers in the public sector in no way own
or control their industries!</p>


<h4>Nationalised industries</h4>

<p>And yet the bureaucratic structure of the nationalised
industries was introduced by Herbert Morrison and other right-wing
[Labour] leaders under the direct pressure of the capitalists and
the Tories during the period of the 1945-50 Labour Government. The
Labour Party should return to the principles passed by the Labour
Party Conferences in 1931 and 1937; that previous owners of
nationalised industries should have no further say and that the
first change in the public company should be to the wages and
conditions of its employees, not to the massive interest payments
or compensation to former owners which cripple industries like rail
and coal now.</p>

<p>We should demand control of the present nationalised industries
under a scheme which would guarantee a majority for the workers on
the governing boards. One third of the boards should be elected by
the unions in the industry, one third by the workers on the
shopfloor, and one third by the [Labour] Government.</p>

<p>The workers' organisations would have a majority against any
bureaucratic tendencies. But at the same time, the overall
interests of the working class in the economy would be preserved.
Already some TU leaders like Ray Buckton (ASLEF - on the
railways) have publicly supported such a plan (at LPYS Conference
1974). <sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Only by such a clear programme can the sham of &quot;participation&quot;
be exposed and the real alternative of workers' control and
management be spelled out. The present Labour Party and TUC
proposals are enough to enrage the employers, but are not enough to
provide a way forward for the Labour Movement in its struggle to
end the power of the capitalist class and all the scandals and
horrors associated with its continued rule.</p>

<p>They are proposals based on an acceptance of the continued
existence of capitalism. A real programme for workers' control is a
step towards a programme for the abolition of capitalism. For only
that can guarantee that every aspect of the working lives of
working people is not decided by a handful of plutocratic
millionaires.</p>
