      <hr />
      <p>The  war drags on without any possibility of a quick and decisive victory for either  side. February finds all Europe immobilised in  the grip of the severest winter for a generation. It is as if the elements  themselves, contemptuous of the stupidity of the human race, had added their  quota to the sufferings of men. At the moment, with the western front  snowbound, there is no likelihood of any large-scale military action.</p>
<p>
It has taken the cold to give the  soldiers some respite. But the outlook in the immediate future is as grim as  the weather: a respite, not a reprieve, has been given to the people of Europe. Relentlessly and with set purpose the  belligerents are preparing for the spring offensive.</p>
<p>
Intense diplomatic activity in all  the countries of Europe, striving for  domination by one group or another, is taking place. The war is waged with  economic and political weapons, but in the background remains the certain  knowledge that it will be decided only by force of arms.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, what the war is being  fought over is being revealed by the deeds and words of both belligerents. First,  Germany has threatened the  small neutrals: &ldquo;If they do not comport themselves in a manner calculated to  conform to an interpretation of neutrality made in Berlin, the Reich will have to consider  taking measures for its own protection.&rdquo; A thinly veiled threat of military  action which fits in well with the declared aim of Germany  &ldquo;That the domination of Europe by England must be ended forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The British press featured  prominently the blustering and bullying of small nations by the Nazi &lsquo;Prussian&rsquo;  bully, and waxed eloquent on the dire fate awaiting them in the event of a  German victory. Comparisons were made between the methods of the allies and the  methods of the Nazis. Chamberlain explained that the allies were fighting for  the rights of small nations to &lsquo;live their own lives&rsquo; without fear of  aggression. But Churchill, in a speech which showed his eagerness to have done  with any hesitation or vacillation to grapple with the enemy as soon as  possible, lifted the mask off the benign face of British imperialism perhaps  too clearly for the ideological purposes of the ruling class: &ldquo;The neutrals  must do their duty, for their fate too is at stake,&rdquo;he threatened, emulating the classic Nazi technique; their duty of  course being to enter the war on the same side as Britain and France. The small  nations, having observed how Britain  had &lsquo;defended&rsquo; Abyssinia, Albania, Austria,  Czech-Slovakia (when it suited her interests to compromise with the aggressor),  do not appreciate the difference between &lsquo;living their own lives&rsquo; for the  benefit of Britain or of Germany.</p>
<p>
The hapless capitalists in the  smaller countries attempt to maintain a precarious balance between the two  warring camps. They know that neither side will hesitate to invade their  territory when it suits the purpose of their military and strategical staff.  They are mere pawns in this game of power politics, and it is to decide who  shall dominate them and the colonies that war is being waged.</p>
<p>
The role of Britain and France  in this war to end &lsquo;Nazism&rsquo; and &lsquo;aggression&rsquo; is shown by their assiduous  courting of Italy.  Mussolini is to be the protector of the independence of small nations in the  Balkans against the twin evils of Nazi aggression and Bolshevism. The allies  are attempting to win Italy  over to the side of &lsquo;democracy and liberty.&rsquo; But Italy  was bribed to betray her alliance with Germany in the last war; she was  promised a fortune and given a dime. So Mussolini is shyly waiting to see where  he can obtain the best advantage before committing himself.</p>
<p>
In the conquered territories of Czechoslovakia and Poland,  the Nazis organise an exploitation and repression unparalleled in modern Europe. The British press is full of stories of the  horror of the regime of national and social barbarism which Hitler has imposed  in these areas: a savagery not of the clumsy and ill-organised brutality of  medieval times, but operated by modern means and machinery. And it is indeed  unnecessary, as in the last war, for the allies to invent tales of German  atrocities. The truth is far more appalling than any number of lies.</p>
<p>
The Nazis, however, are merely  acting in time-honoured imperialist fashion, a little more open, a little  cruder. It was with methods such as these that the British Empire was built up  and maintained, and the Germans have not been slow to retort to the mock  indignation of the imperialists in London.  All Empires have been built in this fashion; the difference exists only in  geography and time. Hitler has transferred to the continent of Europe the  methods of Britain in Asia  and Africa. Lacking colonies and resources  overseas, German imperialism is compelled to attempt to reduce the Czech and  Polish workers and peasants to the level of the coolies and peasants in India.  Imperialism does not distinguish between the colour of white and brown in the  selection of its slaves. There is nothing to distinguish today between the  German and allied diplomacy. The tender admiration now expressed for Franco,  who decimated the Spanish people, the courting of Mussolini, the alliance with Turkey and Rumania  (two of the most ruthless dictatorships in Europe),  all show the concern with which allied imperialism regards Hitler&rsquo;s methods  when they can be used to the advantage of their own money-bags.</p>
<p>
Already Chamberlain, Churchill and  other spokesmen of the government have monotonously reiterated that &lsquo;the whole  German people&rsquo; is responsible for prolonging the war, thereby proving the  assertion of Goebbels that the aim of the allies is to starve Germany, not to  destroy Nazism. This gives an insight into what Europe  will look like under the domination of Threadneedle street. The system of  Asiatic despotism will pervade Europe  whichever side wins the war. It is this fear that drives the German masses to  support the Nazi regime &ndash; they have good reasons to dread the prospect of  becoming the slaves of British and French capital.</p>
<p>
Thus, in methodical and  business-like fashion, both sides prepare for the spring and the neutrals wait  in apprehension; for there is no knowing where the new front will be created.  The war must be &lsquo;opened up&rsquo; and both sides will attempt to use the terrain  which suits them best.</p>
<p>
March winds and April showers will  bring forth not flowers, but a grim harvest of slaughter, and the ordeal will  not be of short duration. &ldquo;We will fight for eight, for ten years, to gain  victory,&rdquo; says Hitler, while Chamberlain comfortingly assures the British  people: &ldquo;We must prepare for a long and grim struggle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
But  we, the youth of Britain,  have learned the lessons of the past. We will not allow ourselves to be  sacrificed as our fathers were, to the Moloch of capitalism.</p>
<p>
No  &ndash; we know our enemies &ndash; it&rsquo;s not the youth of Germany, but those who are  exploiting us at home! The task of Germany&rsquo;s youth is to settle with  its boss class. Our job at home is to overthrow the capitalist system and  establish workers&rsquo; power in Britain.</p>
