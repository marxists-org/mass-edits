The war drags on; or rather the preparation for mass slaughteron both sides goes forward relentlessly and with gathering speed and momentum.</p><p>On February24<sup>th</sup> Chamberlain and Hitler in their speeches both piously appeal todivine intervention as guarantees of victory for justice and right.Nevertheless Chamberlain not so piously echoes the Cromwellian advice &#8220;Trust inGod but keep your powder dry&#8221; while Hitler zealously follows the doctrine of Bismarck: &#8220;God is alwayson the side of the big battalions,&#8221; in his explanation of Nazi diplomacy andmilitary preparations.</p><p>In despair,Chamberlain, with one eye on the British people and the other on the lookoutfor a miracle which will save British capitalism from its impending doom againreverses the &#8220;war aims&#8221; of the British Government. Once again it is not the&#8220;German people&#8221; but &#8220;Nazism&#8221; which is the enemy. &#8220;We for our part should beready to seek a settlement with any Government that had subscribed to theseaims (independence of Polandand Czechoslovakia,etc.) and given proof&#8212;proof that can be relied upon&#8212;of its sincerity.&#8221; Thecampaign against the &#8220;Huns&#8221; has apparently not met with conspicuous success.</p><p> Hitler for his part, denying the charge by implication that Germany desires   world domination states his humble aspirations:</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;I make Germany&#8217;s claim modestly, I claim security for our living   space&#8212;what has been economically developed by Germans in Central Europe.   I also claim our German colonies, of which the plutocrats have robbed us.&#8221; </p><p>To judge fromthe fine words and noble sentiments which ooze from every sentence of theirspeeches, it is all just a tragic misunderstanding. But even while they weretalking, the ignorant tribesmen of the North-West frontier of India were beingtaught by British capitalism with planes and machine guns exactly what shemeans by the rights of nations to live their own lives, while Germanimperialism, too, on the backs of the enslaved Poles and Czechs wasenlightening Europe as to the real meaning of &#8220;Lebensraum.&#8221;</p><p>Reading thesespeeches the small neutrals can well shiver with apprehension as the giantslook round for some battleground on which they can come to grips. Thediplomatic tussles of the last few weeks have revealed in deeds the realdesires of the participants in the war. Scandinavia has become one of thecentres of the intrigues of London.Berlin and Paris.</p><p>For a longtime now, Germany, for strategic reasons, in her desire to strike a blowagainst the Allies, has waged a cruel and merciless war on the shipping ofNorway, Denmark and Sweden, in order to exert pressure on these little&#8220;neutrals&#8221; to force them to support Germany economically, and allow their watersto be an economic bridge between Germany and Russia, circumventing the controlof the seas by the Allies.</p><p>This &#8220;brutalattitude&#8221; towards the &#8220;weak and defenceless&#8221; Northern states has sent theAllied press into paroxysms of rage and disgust which they contrast with theattitude of the &#8220;cowardly Nazi bully&#8221; towards those big and powerful neutralswho have the means to hit back: Japan, Italy, Russia and America, whoseshipping and interests are treated with every consideration by the Germans.</p><p> Thus triumphantly was demonstrated the superiority of British and French democracy   in its war methods and aims. But the last few weeks have laid bare the hypocrisy   of the Allied camp as well. When they came into conflict with Japan over the   arrest of German sailors in Japanese ships, despite the aggressive war of rape   and brutality which Japan has been waging for three years against the Chinese   people, we have the British bourgeoisie going on their hands and knees to conciliate   and placate these inhuman &#8220;aggressors,&#8221; Says Chamberlain in a speech   reported in the <em>Times</em> of February 1<sup>st</sup></p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;&#8230;And indeed nothing would more distress us than that there should   be in the minds of the Japanese people or the Japanese Government any idea that   we had intentionally or deliberately exercised our belligerent rights as we   see them with a want of courtesy or a want of consideration to the Japanese   nation&#8230; The last thing that we want to do is to affront the self-respect   of a friendly nation with whom we want to live in peace&#8230;&#8221;  </p><p>With Italy sogreat has been their desire to exercise their belligerent rights with courtesyand consideration that this successful aggressor who grabbed Albania andAbyssinia not so very long ago is even allowed to break the Allied &#8220;blockade,&#8221;by importing coal from Germany by sea, without let or hindrance from theAllies. Italian fascism, whose methods internally and externally areindistinguishable from Nazism, is thus tenderly treated in order to win Italy over tothe struggle against &#8220;aggression&#8221; and for the &#8220;ending of Nazism forever.&#8221;</p><p>The Nazishave always found reasons to justify their &#8220;aggression&#8221; on other nations bylying stories of &#8220;provocation&#8221; &#8220;intolerable oppression of Germans,&#8221; etc. Atechnique which Chamberlain now claims the &#8220;apprentice Stalin&#8221; has learned fromhis mentor Hitler. But in this line of business the German imperialists canteach nothing to their British counterparts. The capitalist hypocrites canalways find plausible reasons for their trampling on the rights of othernations. Chamberlain after indignantly explaining the Nazis crimes against theneutrals, airily dismissed the &#8220;Altmark&#8221; affair as a &#8220;mere technical breach ofneutrality.&#8221;</p><p> The Altmark incident was a gift from heaven to the Allies. If there had been   no Altmark it would have been necessary to invent one. The justification in   the eyes of the British people for the turning of Britain into a &#8220;technical&#8221;   aggressor was accomplished by lies and exaggerations about the &#8220;Nazi Hell   Ship,&#8221; &#8220;the dashing Nelson tradition,&#8221; &#8220;gallant rescue   of 300 seamen,&#8221; etc. </p><p>The Altmark&#8217;sreal significance does not lie in the rescue of the 300 sailors. For them theBritish imperialists would not stir a finger, for they will sacrifice anynumber of men in the interests of profit: But the incident was an ideal testfor the reactions of the British people if and when Britain is compelled, for militaryand strategic reasons, to attack or coerce one of the small neutrals.</p><p>Theexperiment worked. The harrowing tales of the suffering of the seamen enabledthe capitalists to gain the support of the British people in this minor deed ofaggression. They can now go ahead with their blackmail and threatening of thesmall neutrals confident that they will be able to manufacture incidents andexcuses to justify and mobilise British public opinion behind their acts.Already the <em>Daily Express</em>, least cautious of the yellow organs, hascalled for the British navy to operate in Norwegian territory against Germanships using the shelter of the three-mile limit over which Norwegian sovereigntyextends. They are blurting out crudely what Churchill threatened the neutralswith in veiled hints.</p><p>TheNorwegians have offered to submit the dispute to arbitration. But the Britishimperialists who have always harped on Hitler&#8217;s refusal to submit his &#8220;disputed&#8217;with his selected victims to &#8220;impartial judgment,&#8221; show a lack of enthusiasm inexactly the same way when their own interests are at stake and when they toocan settle the issue by the pressure of the overwhelming military force attheir disposal.</p><p>Hitler hasutilised these incidents to further draw the German people behind him. Hitlershows the German workers how the British people have rallied behind Chamberlainand the hypocrisy of the British capitalists&#8217; claim to be the champion of thesmall nations. In this, he has been assisted by the labour leaders in Britain.</p><p>Utilising thecrimes of Stalin, the labour leaders have denounced the invasion of Finland instrident terms. &#8220;Poor little Finland,&#8221;&#8220;the ending of aggression,&#8221; the &#8220;rights of small nations to live their ownlives,&#8221; these have been the axioms on which labour policy was allegedly based.They even came out for the ending of imperialism, including British&#8212;after thewar was over of course.</p><p>Here in theAltmark affair was a magnificent opportunity to show their mettle. No excusewhatever can justify aggression, they have told us. Norwayis no bigger than Finlandand even more defenceless. Britainhas flagrantly violated Norwegian neutrality. And the Labour leaders haveshamelessly added their applause to that of the jingoes for the &#8220;daring deeds&#8221;of the British navy. Chamberlain may plead like the girl who had anillegitimate child, that it was &#8220;only a little one.&#8221; But what can the Labourleaders say? Hitler&#8217;s gangsterism cannot extenuate the Allied violations in anyway. Why have they not protested in Parliament and exposed the aims and deedsof the National Government to the workers of Britain? They have betrayed theworking class by supporting the war which is being fought for imperialist interests.Tomorrow they will support any aggression which the capitalists are compelledto launch as they have supported them over the Altmark. The propaganda machineof Goebbels explains to the German workers how the workers in Britain aresupporting their capitalists and appeals to them to support &#8220;national unity.&#8221;And Morrison, Citrine and Attlee render him the best aid possible.</p><p>The CommunistParty is no better. They use this incident to suggest a &#8220;peace&#8221; which can onlymean victory for Hitler. This the workers quite rightly reject as no solutionto the problem.</p><p> Meanwhile the preparations proceed apace: Victory for German imperialism or   victory for British imperialism, neither can be in the interests of the workers   of Britain, Germany or of the &#8220;small nations.&#8221; And neither can gain   victory soon. The misery and the slaughter will proceed endlessly once the war   really begins. </p><p>The solutionrests in the power of the working class. The war can only be ended and a realpeace obtained by the victory of the German and the British workers againsttheir real enemy, German and British capitalism. The Socialist United States of Europe:that is our slogan. It is for this and not for the wars and the profiteering ofcapitalism that youth will make its sacrifice and lead the way.</p><p class="skip">&nbsp;</p><hr class="end" /><p class="footer"><a href="../../index.htm">Ted GrantArchive</a></p></body></html>
