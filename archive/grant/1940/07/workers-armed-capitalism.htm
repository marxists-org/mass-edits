   <p class="fst"> The last few years have marked the end of an epoch in human  history. The staggering and annihilating defeat of the armies of France by the Nazi war machine has left the  continent of Europe under the bloody tyranny  of German imperialism. </p>

   <p> The empty boasts of Reynaud have been followed by the  shameful surrender of Petain and Weygand. The puffed up reputation which was  built up around the military valour of these &lsquo;heroes' stood the test while it  was only concerned with the shooting down of the rebellious colonial masses of  Algeria and Morocco, but was pitifully inadequate when faced with the monstrous  military regime of Germany. </p>

   <p> The ruling class of France,  which had helped in the building up of reaction in Germany, showed itself completely  incapable of offering any effective resistance to the Nazi legions. The  capitalists paralysed the struggle against Hitler by their suppression of the  French masses. Hitler could have been held up in North France, and again at the  gates of Paris,  if the whole population had been mobilised for resistance. </p>

   <h4>Why Paris Was Not Defended</h4>
   <p class="fst"> But for the ruling classes to have armed the workers would  have meant that they were running the risk of these arms being used not only  against Hitler, but also against the ruling classes themselves. Especially did  they fear the revolutionary workers of Paris. </p>

   <p> Once before, when the Prussians were at the gates of Paris in 1870, and the  workers had been armed, they seized control in the first successful workers'  uprising in history. The <em>Daily Telegraph</em> Correspondent in France  writes on June 17th: &quot;Danger of a Communist uprising and civil war compelled  the French Government to sue for peace.&quot; They handed Paris intact to the Germans. </p>

   <p> <em>France was betrayed.</em> The real Fifth Column was  the capitulation government of financiers, manufacturers, millionaires and  generals. It was they who sold the French people into the hands of Hitler.  Rather than lose <em>all</em> their profits by  a victory of the French masses, these &lsquo;patriots' preferred to assure themselves  of a few scraps from the tables of the Nazis. </p>

   <h4>How Will Britain Be Defended?</h4>
   <p class="fst"> And now the insatiable German imperialists are preparing for  the destruction of Britain.  The British Government has announced that it is doing everything to counter  this coming attack. But the ruling class of Britain  is as rotten as that of France.  The only real preparations they are making are those for use against their  &lsquo;main enemy' at home. </p>

   <p> In France  20,000 police were left in Paris  to &lsquo;maintain order' and to hand over control to Himmler. A special civil guard  was formed to keep order in the rear of the armies. Is there any guarantee that  the British ruling class will not capitulate in the same manner as the French? </p>

   <h4>The Workers Must Be Armed</h4>
   <p class="fst"> There is only one guarantee of a successful resistance to  any attempt at invasion by Nazis: the arming of the working-class in every  street and every factory, and the control of this workers' militia by workers'  committees. </p>

   <p> This would render Britain completely impregnable.  Parachute invaders and sea-borne troops alike would receive short shrift at the  hands of the masses. </p>

   <p> But the ruling-class cannot take this road for the same  reason that the French rulers could not take it: it would present an even  greater menace to their profit-making and domination than even a victory of the  Nazis. </p>

   <p> Chamberlain, the Tory party, big business and the bankers of  the City of London  backed Hitler for years as a bulwark against Socialism, and only fought him  reluctantly when German imperialism threatened their Empire and their profits.  The contradictions between the two imperialisms gave them no alternative. But  they are responsible for the disastrous position in which the British and  European workers find themselves today. They have acted as Hitler's real fifth  column for years. Their record, their very nature, and their position in society,  renders them completely impotent to defend the workers against fascism. They  must be swept aside, and the workers themselves must guide their own destinies. </p>

   <h4>Only Socialism Can Defeat Hitler</h4>
   <p class="fst"> For years the Labour leaders have allegedly been conducting  a campaign against the pro-fascist policy of Chamberlain and the National  Government. But they now sit in that same government and assist it in a policy  that is disastrous for the working-class. </p>

   <p> Rank and file militants in the trade unions, Labour party,  and Leagues of Youth must demand that the Labour leaders must wage a struggle  for full power immediately. Labour must take control on a programme which can  mobilise all the toilers of Britain.  And first on that programme must come the arming of the workers against their  capitalist enemy at home and against the imperialist invader. </p>

   <p> The resources of Britain cannot be utilised unless a  great plan is undertaken which eliminates the waste and bureaucratic  inefficiency of capitalism. The capitalist Fifth Column must be rendered  completely impotent by the taking over of the banks, mines, land, railways and  all big industries, without compensation and under control of the workers. </p>

   <p> On a programme of Socialism at home the masses of Britain could  be mobilised for the death struggle against Nazism. But we must face the enemy  with an unstained banner. British imperialism oppresses the masses in the  colonies as viciously as Hitler does the people who are under his heel on the  continent. Labour must immediately issue a declaration giving full  self-determination to the peoples of the Empire. </p>

   <p> Then we could face the bombing planes and tanks of Hitler  without fear of defeat. An appeal could be made to all the peoples of Europe,  and especially those of Germany,  to rally to our side. Hitler's support would crumble beneath his feet, and a  mighty movement for liberation would spring up among the German soldiers and  workers. </p>

   <p> Only the slogans of genuine social and national liberation  can find an echo among the oppressed masses of Europe.  On this road alone can there be salvation for the working-class. </p>

   <p> The prospect of a British army advancing to the re-conquest  of Europe under the rule of the imperialists  after months and years of preparation opens up an endless vista of slaughter  and destruction. </p>

   <p> The choice before the working-class is clear. The road of  Blum and Jouhaux led to the degradation and humiliation of the French masses,  and their subjection to the Nazi exploiter. Attlee and Citrine are leading the  British Labour movement to the same disaster. Only a programme of Socialism can  save the workers of Britain  and Europe. </p>

   <p> But the sands of time are running out; action must be taken  quickly. If the Labour leaders refuse to carry out this programme of socialism  then they will be exposed to the masses as the traitors they are and it will be  made clear that only the revolutionary socialists can lead the way forward to  peace and socialism. </p>
   <ul class="disc"> 
   <li> Disarm the capitalists and arm the workers for the  struggle against Nazism and the capitalist Fifth column at home. </li>
   <li> Take over the mines, banks, railways and big industry without compensation. </li>
   <li> Give freedom and self-determination to India and the  colonies. </li>
   <li> Repeal all anti-working-class legislation. </li>
   <li> Appeal to the German, French and European workers to  support the socialist struggle against Hitler. </li>
   </ul>
