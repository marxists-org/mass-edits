   <h1>Lenin and Trotsky&mdash;What They Really Stood For</h1>
   <hr />
   <h4>Chapter 6</h4>
   <h3>The Rise of Stalinism</h3>

<p>
Monty Johnstone does not waste his reader&#39;s time by introducing into his &quot;balanced
estimate&quot; of Trotsky&#39;s career any details of the key role which he admits Trotsky
played in the Civil War, to which he devotes one paragraph. Perhaps it would have
prejudiced the reader&#39;s sense of objectivity to discover, for instance, that Lenin
provided Trotsky during the Civil War with blank sheets of paper to which Lenin&#39;s
signature was appended, authorising any action which the &quot;revolutionary
phrasemonger&quot; saw fit to take!
</p>

<p>
Glossing over the little episode of the Civil War, Johnstone refers us to his old
friend Isaac Deutscher, in whose <em>Prophet Armed </em>the story is &quot;stirringly
told&quot; of &quot;both Trotsky&#39;s mistakes (sometimes serious) and of his achievements
(which much out-weighed them)&quot; And that is <em>clearly </em>the reason why Monty
Johnstone is not over-anxious to dwell on the Civil War. Having spent the first half of
his work trying to paint a picture of Trotsky as a petty-bourgeois individualist, devoid
of organisational abilities, he goes on, without the least hint of embarrassment, to quote
the words of Gorky:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p align="left">
	&quot;Show me another man&quot;, he (Lenin) said, thumping the table
	&quot;capable of organising in a year an almost exemplary army and moreover of winning the
	esteem of the military specialists.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>, page 17)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Fearing lest the &quot;balance&quot; of this estimate should be upset by all this Monty
Johnstone hastens to add another quotation from Gorky where, Lenin is supposed to have
said of Trotsky:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;He isn&#39;t one of us. With us, but not of us. He is ambitious. There is something
	of Lassalle in him, something which isn&#39;t good.&quot;
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Monty Johnstone&#39;s scrupulous use of quotations has already been commented on. This is
another good example. <em>The second quotation does not occur anywhere in the original
edition of Gorky&#39;s Reminiscences of Lenin</em>, written in 1924. At that early date it
would not have been possible to insert so blatant a falsehood. But Gorky was obliged to
rewrite his memoirs in 1930. On Stalin&#39;s orders, parts of Gorky&#39;s memory faded, while
other &quot;memories&quot; made their first appearance: among them, the particular piece
of falsification quoted by Monty Johnstone. And since Comrade Johnstone is interested in
Gorky&#39;s report of Lenin&#39;s attitude to Trotsky, let us throw in another piece from the <em>genuine</em>,
original memoirs where Lenin attacks the slanderers who attempted to drive a wedge between
him and Trotsky: &quot;Yes, yes, I know they lie a lot about my relations with him.&quot;

</p>

<h4>The Trade Union Controversy</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;In the first big Party discussion after the Revolution involving the problem of
	bureaucracy, Trotsky clashed head on with the majority of the Bolshevik Central Committee.
	Lenin strongly criticised his policy of bureaucratically nagging the Trade Unions as
	expressing &#39;the worst in military experience&#39; and containing &#39;a number of errors that are
	connected with the very essence of the dictatorship of the proletariat&#39;.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>,
	page 19)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Once again, the reader should note Monty Johnstone&#39;s method of &quot;analysis&quot;,
which consists purely and simply of taking isolated snippets of quotations, torn from
their contexts, with no indication of the background, of the arguments themselves, or even
of the dates! Marxists, beginning with Marx, have always insisted upon such small things
as dates, accurate and <em>full </em>quotations, theoretical analysis, and the rest. Only by
a scrupulously honest approach can historical questions be explained.
</p>

<p>
The trade union dispute was one episode in the whole crisis of the political and
economic mode of organisation known as War Communism, and cannot be understood apart from
this question. Lenin described War Communism as &quot;communism in a besieged
fortress&quot;. This system, based upon strict centralisation and the introduction of
quasi-military measures into all fields of life, flowed from the difficulties of the
revolution isolated in a backward, war-shattered country, under conditions of civil war
and foreign intervention. Yet Monty Johnstone poses the question as if Trotsky alone held
the position of &quot;militarisation of labour&quot;. The first years of Soviet power were
characterised by acute economic difficulties, partly the result of war and civil war,
partly as a result of the shortage of both materials and skilled manpower, and partly of
the opposition of the peasant small property owners to the socialist measures of the
Bolsheviks.
</p>

<p>

In 1920, the production of iron ore and cast iron fell to 1.6% and 2.4% of their 1913
levels. The best record was for oil, which stood at 41 % of its 1913 level. Coal attained
17%. <em>The general production of fully manufactured goods in </em>1920<em> stood at </em>12.9%<em>
of their </em>1913<em> value. </em>Agricultural production dropped in two years (1917-19) by
16%, the heaviest losses being sustained by those products exported from the villages to
the town: hemp fell by 26%, flax by 32%, fodder by 40%. The conditions of civil war,
together with the chronic inflation of the period, brought trade between town and
countryside to a virtual standstill.
</p>

<p>
The ghastly conditions of the workers in the towns led to a mass exodus from industry
to the land. By 1919 the number of industrial workers declined to 76% of the 1917 level,
while that of building workers fell to 66%, railway workers to 63%. By 1920, the figure
for industrial workers generally fell from three millions in 1917 to 1,240,000 - i.e. <em>to
less than half. </em>In two years the working class population of Petrograd was halved.
Even these figures do not convey the full extent of the catastrophe since they leave out
of account <em>the decline in labour productivity </em>of those ragged half-starved workers
who remained in the factories.

</p>

<p>
Even more serious than the economic consequences, from the Bolshevik point of view, was
the rapid erosion of the <em>class basis of the Revolution </em>which Rudzutak graphically
described at the second all-Russian Congress of trade unions in January 1919:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;We observe in a large number of industrial centres that the workers, thanks to
	the contraction of production in the factories, are being absorbed in the peasant mass,
	and instead of a population of workers we are getting a half peasant or sometimes purely
	peasant population.&quot;
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
In order to put a stop to this catastrophic decline, drastic measures were introduced
to get industry moving, to feed the hungry workers and to end the drift from town to
country. That was the essential meaning of &quot;War Communism&quot;. The Seventh Party
Congress in March 1918 called for &quot;the most energetic, unsparingly decisive,
draconian measures to raise the self-discipline and discipline of the workers and
peasants.&quot; To the complaints of the Mensheviks, Lenin replied that:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;We should be ridiculous utopians if we imagined that such a task could be carried
	out on the day after the fall of the bourgeoisie, i.e. in the first stage of transition
	from capitalism to socialism, or without compulsion.&quot;
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
The arguments of the Mensheviks and the &quot;lefts&quot; based upon a caricature of
bourgeois arguments about the &quot;freedom of labour&quot; reflected the growing mood of
disenchantment with the dictatorship of the proletariat among the backward and
petty-bourgeois strata, especially the peasantry who bore the brunt of the policy of War
Communism.

</p>

<p>
Lenin had seen as early as 1905, that the peasantry would support the Revolution
insofar as it gave them land, but that the rich strata would inevitably pass over to the
opposition as soon as the revolution began to attack the foundations of private property.
A dangerous situation would be created if the revolution remained isolated. The
proletariat was a tiny minority in a sea of peasant small-property owners. Without a
steady supply of raw materials and food from the villages, industry would grind to a halt.
But, given the shattered condition of industry; there was no possibility of immediately
establishing conditions of healthy exchange between town and country, of providing the
peasantry with the manufactured goods it demanded in exchange for its products. At the
Ninth Party Congress Lenin put the matter in a nutshell:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;If we could tomorrow give 100,000 first-class tractors, supply them with benzene,
	supply them mechanics (you know well that for the present this is a fantasy), the middle
	peasant would say: &#39;I am for Communism&#39;. But in order to do this, it is first necessary to
	conquer the international bourgeoisie, to compel it to give us these tractors.&quot;
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Lenin explained time and again that the <em>only </em>real solution to the problems
facing the revolution was the victory of the socialist revolution in one or more of the
advanced countries. In the meantime, the economic crisis had to be tackled by drastic
measures. Even after the Civil War, Lenin made a speech at the All-Russian Congress of
Soviets in 1920 where he explained that &quot;In a country of small peasants, it is our
chief and fundamental task to discover how to achieve <em>state compulsion in order to
raise peasant production</em>.&quot; (our emphasis)

</p>

<p>
To arrest the flow of workers from town to country, draconian measures were introduced
against &quot;labour desertions&quot;. In 1920, a worker at the Kolomesky works told the
visiting British Labour delegation that &quot;desertions from the works were frequent and
that deserters were arrested by soldiers and brought back from the villages.&quot; An
official decree, passed after the Ninth Party Congress (March 1920) prescribed severe
punishment for &quot;labour desertion&quot; up to and including hard labour. Labour was
put on a military footing. &quot;War Communism&quot; meant the &quot;militarisation of
labour&quot;, for a temporary period.
</p>


<p>
Those who lump together Lenin and Trotsky with the regime of Stalin and his heirs, by
using the arguments of Kautsky and the Mensheviks about the &quot;regime of
coercion&quot;, ignore the differences of time, place, methods and conditions. Even in the
most democratic of bourgeois states, such as Britain, under wartime conditions measures
were taken prohibiting the free movement of labour, changing of jobs, etc. as
&quot;exceptional&quot; measures. The Bolsheviks were faced with Civil War, following hard
upon four years of a disastrous imperialist war. The country was ruined by the
depredations of the White Guards and the armies of intervention. Under such conditions
drastic measures were absolutely necessary. But as always with Lenin and Trotsky freedom
of discussion and criticism by the workers and peasants, especially within the Bolshevik
Party itself, was safeguarded. Even in capitalist Britain, during the War, the workers
were prepared to accept &quot;exceptional&quot; measures, which they thought were
necessary for the defence of their rights. In Russia, with a workers&#39; and peasants&#39;
government, the workers were prepared to accept temporarily the harsh measures which were
necessary to preserve the Revolution.
</p>

<h4>Trotsky - an &quot;Arch-bureaucrat&quot;?</h4>

<p>
Monty Johnstone is uncomfortably aware of the fact that, after Lenin&#39;s death, the
struggle against bureaucratic degeneration and Stalinism was led by Trotsky and the Left
Opposition. He is therefore at pains to make out a &quot;case&quot; that Trotsky himself
was an &quot;arch-bureaucrat&quot;, the enemy of workers&#39; democracy and free Trade Unions.
He creates the utterly false impression that the &quot;militarisation of labour&quot; was
the standpoint of Trotsky alone and, by dint of his customary impressionism, hints that
Trotsky carried through &quot;his&quot; policies <em>against the majority </em>of the
Central Committee! Just how this feat was accomplished, Comrade Johnstone does not
explain. He cannot do so because it is <em>a plain lie.</em>

</p>

<p>
On January 15, 1920, a government decree transformed the Army of the Urals into the
first &quot;revolutionary army of labour&quot;. A later decree entrusted to the
revolutionary council of the first labour army the &quot;general direction of the work of
restoring and strengthening the normal economic and military life in the Urals&quot;.
Similar powers were granted to the council of the labour armies of the Caucasus and the
Ukraine. An army was sent to assist in the construction of a railway in Turkestan, another
worked the Donetz coal mines. While Red soldiers helped in the running of industry, those
workers who were not called up for military service were conscripted for the &quot;Front
of Labour&quot; as explained above.
</p>

<p>
Was all this the work of the arch-bureaucrat Trotsky? On January 12, 1920, Lenin and
Trotsky spoke on a joint platform to a meeting of Bolshevik trade union leaders. The
object of the meeting was to persuade them to accept the policy of &quot;militarisation of
labour&quot;. The motion of acceptance, tabled in the names of Lenin and Trotsky, was
defeated, with only two votes cast in favour - those of Lenin and Trotsky. Imagine such an
incident occurring in the time of Stalin or today!
</p>




<p>
<em>This incident was not isolated. On every one of the main economic and political
questions at this time, Lenin and Trotsky were in complete agreement. </em>On the
controversial question of employment of bourgeois specialists in the army and industry,
Lenin and Trotsky fought a hard battle to get their proposals accepted by the rest of the
Bolshevik Party leadership. Similarly, on the issue of one-man management and the agrarian
policy, there was complete identity of views. On all of this, Monty Johnstone keeps mum.
Such information would only upset the &quot;balance&quot; of his analysis.
</p>

<h4>Once again, the Trade Union Controversy</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;In 1920 in addition to his job as Commissar for War, he [Trotsky] had taken over
	the Department of Transport, of vital economic and military importance. Placing the
	railwaymen and the workers in the railway repair workshops under martial law, he met the
	objections of the railwaymen&#39;s union by dismissing its leaders and appointing others more
	compliant in their place. He did the same with other transport workers&#39; unions His efforts
	brought results: the railways were restored ahead of schedule.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>, page
	19)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
By means of precisely that innuendo which was supposed not to feature in his work,
Johnstone tries to create an impression of Trotsky, the arch bureaucrat, &quot;taking
over&quot; the railways at gunpoint and, on his own initiative, bulldozing the workers in
true Stalinist fashion. What are the facts?
</p>

<p>
The destruction of Russia&#39;s vast railway networks was one of the most crippling blows
to the economy dealt by the Civil War. Of 70,000 versts of track, only 15,000 escaped
damage. More than 60% of the locomotives were out of order. The dislocation of the economy
caused by the breakdown of communications reached crisis point in 1920, when, unless
drastic action was taken, the whole of Russian industry would suffer an irreversible
catastrophe. Coming at the height of the Polish War, this meant that <em>the fate of the
revolution was in the balance.</em>
</p>

<p>
The Ninth Party Congress, in a special resolution, declared that the main problem in
overcoming the crisis on the railways was the railwaymen&#39;s union. This was an old craft
union, traditionally Menshevik, which had already clashed with the Bolshevik government on
the question of control of the railways. The Ninth Party Congress which placed Trotsky in
charge of the work of restoring the railways, also empowered him to draft into the union a
body of able and loyal workers, to prod it into action. When the officials of the union
refused to submit to the new regulations, not Trotsky, but the <em>Central Committee </em>of
the Party decided to replace the old officials with a new committee composed of dedicated
communists: only <em>one </em>vote was cast against, that of the &quot;Right&quot; Communist
and Trade Union leader, Tomsky. The rest, including Lenin, Zinoviev and Stalin, all voted
in favour.

</p>

<p>
Johnstone portrays Trotsky as the &quot;evil genius&quot; behind the
&quot;militarisation of labour&quot; and War Communism. <em>He conveniently forgets that
Trotsky was the first of the Bolshevik leaders to advocate the abandonment of War
Communism,</em> as early as February, 1920. At that time, Trotsky submitted to the Central
Committee a set of theses which pointed to the continued disruption of the economy, the
weakening of the proletariat, and the widening gulf between town and country. He advocated
the replacement of forced requisition of grain by a grain tax, and measures aimed at the
partial restoration of the shattered market economy. <em>In essence, these policies were
subsequently adopted under the New Economic Policy.</em>
</p>

<p>
Trotsky&#39;s proposals, which were opposed by Lenin, were defeated in the Central
Committee, which favoured the continuation of the policies of War Communism. Accepting
that the &quot;war&quot; methods would have to be continued for a further period, against
his own point of view, Trotsky endeavoured to make the system work as well as possible. It
is for this crime that Trotsky is once again pilloried by Monty Johnstone who &quot;acts
dumb&quot; about Trotsky&#39;s opposition to the basis of War Communism itself.

</p>

<p>
Johnstone paints a portrait of Trotsky as the dictatorial &quot;arch-bureaucrat&quot;
on the strength of a few extracts of a speech in which Trotsky criticised the liberal
idealisation of &quot;free labour&quot; in the abstract, and pointed out that non-free
labour could also be productive. The remark that chattel-slavery, in its day, had been
progressive, indisputable from a Marxist point of view, is taken out of context and given
a sinister twist by Monty Johnstone (following in the footsteps of Deutscher). Alas! The
speech which Comrade Johnstone so eagerly snatches from Deutscher&#39;s ever-open palm was
made, not at the Tenth Party Congress, but at the Third All-Russian Congress of Trade
Unions, where Trotsky, as the spokesman for the Bolsheviks, was speaking, not against
Lenin, but against the <em>Mensheviks</em>, whose tearful pleas for the &quot;freedom of
labour&quot; Monty Johnstone now repeats so touchingly.
</p>

<p>

The Mensheviks, in order to discredit the Bolshevik government, used the measures which
had been forced on the Soviet Republic by the conditions of Civil War and intervention in
a thoroughly dishonest and unscrupulous way. Their arguments were a caricature so far as
&quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;free labour&quot; were concerned. The Bolsheviks stood for
the most complete freedom - even including freedom for bourgeois parties - provided they
did not attempt armed rebellion against the Soviet power. But under the circumstances when
the &quot;liberal&quot; bourgeoisie had fled to the camp of the White Armies, such talk
amounted to the demand that the Revolution should not defend itself against White
reaction. The alternative to the dictatorship of the proletariat was not, as the
Mensheviks claimed, some kind of Weimar democracy. but the bloody rule of reaction. The
Social-Democratic critics of Bolshevism were the sort of people who were quite prepared to
act as accomplices of Imperialism in the bloody and obscene world war, but who threw up
their hands in horror at the &quot;ruthless&quot; measures of Lenin and Trotsky. Yet it
was their betrayal of the revolutionary movements of 1917-21 that paved the way for the
rise of Nazism and a new and even more barbaric world war.
</p>

<p>
The differences among the Bolsheviks on the trade unions were not, as one would suppose
from the vulgar portrait painted by Monty Johnstone, between the
&quot;arch-bureaucrat&quot; Trotsky and Lenin the defender of &quot;free labour&quot;, but

<em>an expression of the crisis in the Party brought about by the impasse of War Communism.
</em>The original differences, as Lenin explained, were inconsequential. But small
frictions in the leadership, under the given conditions, led to a series of divisions in
the Party, with not two platforms, but five at least being put forward.
</p>

<p>
Lenin&#39;s prime consideration at this time was to prevent a split in the leadership and
to preserve the tenuous thread binding the proletariat and its vanguard to the
non-proletarian and semi-proletarian masses. Under the prevailing conditions of economic
crisis, of mass illiteracy, of a numerically weakened and increasingly demoralised working
class, and above all, of the crushing preponderance of the petty-bourgeois peasant masses,
the Bolshevik Party was increasingly coming under the pressure of alien class forces. The
fact that the Bolsheviks had been forced, contrary to their intentions, to illegalise the
opposition parties, meant that these pressures would inevitably seek to find expression
through the Bolshevik Party itself. What Lenin feared most was <em>a split in the Party
along class lines. </em>This lay at the basis of Lenin&#39;s opposition to Trotsky&#39;s original
proposal to &quot;shake up&quot; the union officials and bring them into line with central
planning, which caused friction with the Trade Union leader Tomsky.
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone begins his account of the trade union controversy with a quote from
Lenin&#39;s article <em>The Party Crisis. </em>Lenin had attempted to keep the differences
within the leadership by setting up a commission to investigate the trade unions. In the
course of the Central Committee discussion, Lenin, in his own words made a number of
obviously exaggerated and therefore mistaken &quot;attacks&quot; which sharpened the
conflict. Trotsky had refused to join the commission. Monty Johnstone quotes Lenin&#39;s words
of censure:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;This step <em>alone </em>causes Comrade Trotsky&#39;s original mistake to become
	magnified and later to lead to factionalism.&quot;
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
But this is one of Comrade Johnstone&#39;s half quotes. Let us see what Lenin adds in <em>the
very next sentence</em>:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Without this step, his mistake (in submitting incorrect theses) remained a very
	minor one such as every member of the Central Committee, without exception, has had
	occasion to make.&quot; (<em>Works</em>, vol. 32, page 45)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Monty Johnstone&#39;s readers are allowed to read only as much of Lenin as he considers
good for their health. By quoting only <em>polemical rejoinders</em>, Monty Johnstone

&quot;helps&quot; Lenin by &quot;sharpening&quot; his struggle against Trotsky for him.
Elsewhere in this section he repeatedly presents as the standpoint of Trotsky arguments
which were consistently advanced and defended by Lenin and <em>all </em>the leaders of
Bolshevism. Paraphrasing and &quot;improving&quot; Trotsky&#39;s arguments, Johnstone writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Russia, he [Trotsky] argued repeatedly, suffered not from the excess but from the
	lack of efficient bureaucracy, [?] to which he [?] favoured giving certain limited
	concessions. Reporting this, Deutscher comments: &#39;He thus makes himself the spokesman of
	the managerial groups.&#39;&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>, page 20)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Johnstone&#39;s invocation of the shade of Deutscher does not add the least odour of
sanctity to his arguments. Anyone who has read Deutscher will know that he attacks not
only the &quot;dictatorial&quot; ideas of Trotsky, <em>but also of Lenin</em>, and in fact
does not distinguish between the two. His philistine appraisal of Trotsky is the identical
twin of his views on Lenin, and on revolutionaries in general.
</p>

<p>
The arguments which Monty Johnstone puts in the mouth of Trotsky correspond exactly to
the views advanced hundreds of times by Lenin on the need for efficiency, for
business-like management, for specialists to whom Lenin &quot;favoured giving certain
limited concessions&quot;, not the outrageous &quot;concessions&quot; extracted by the
parasitic Stalinist bureaucracies in Russia and Eastern Europe today, but simply and
solely to get the shattered economy moving again, to enable the revolution to survive
until the revolutionary proletariat of Europe could come to its assistance. Once again,
Johnstone presents as &quot;Trotskyism&quot; the ideas of Lenin, of the Bolshevik Party,
of Marxism itself. But this merely underlines the profound gulf which separates all the
ideologists of Stalinism from the ideas and traditions of Bolshevism. Bending the
arguments, Johnstone puts Lenin&#39;s words in the mouth of Trotsky; and on the lips of Lenin,
the arguments of those true defenders of the caricatures of free labour - the Mensheviks.

</p>

<h4>Lenin on the Trade Unions</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;In practice, said Lenin, the Soviet state was &#39;a workers state with bureaucratic
	distortions&#39;. For a long time, he argued, the trade unions would need to &#39;struggle against
	the bureaucratic distortions of the Soviet apparatus&#39;, and for &#39;the protection of the
	material and spiritual interests of the masses of the toilers by the ways and means that
	this apparatus cannot employ&#39;.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>, page 21)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
What is the meaning of this quotation? Not that Lenin differed from Trotsky in the
estimation of the state apparatus and its bureaucratic deformations. The point at issue
was the immediate policy to be adopted if the system of War Communism was to be
maintained. However, what is really interesting and significant is <em>the fact that
throughout this entire section of his work, Monty Johnstone does not make clear a single
one of Lenin&#39;s arguments on the trade union question. </em>And this is no accident.
</p>

<p>
Lenin argued, dialectically, that the trade unions in a workers&#39; state must be
independent, in order that the working class can defend itself against the state, and in
turn defend the workers&#39; state itself. Lenin was emphatic on this point because he saw the
danger of the state raising itself above the class and separating itself from it. <em>The
workers, by themselves through their organisations, could exercise a check on the state
apparatus and on the bureaucracy.</em>
</p>

<p>

It is ironical to read Johnstone&#39;s strictures on Trotsky&#39;s alleged &quot;bureaucratic
tendencies&quot;, in the light of what happened to the &quot;independence of the trade
unions&quot; in Russia under Stalin and the position today. Evidently, when Trotsky was
&quot;in power&quot; he was a bureaucrat; when Stalin was in power, he, regrettably also
succumbed to the &quot;Cult of Personality&quot;. It is all a question of
&quot;personalities&quot;! This is the method, not of Marxism, but of the middle-class
vulgarians, who see politics in terms of individuals who &quot;sell out&quot; as soon as
they come to power. And yet, despite this highly &quot;critical&quot; approach Monty
Johnstone&#39;s critical faculties evaporate into thin air as soon as we reach the famous

&quot;Twentieth Congress&quot;:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Trotsky is presented by his supporters [!] as the champion of the struggle
	against bureaucracy in the Soviet Union. Since during the last seventeen years of his life
	Trotsky was tireless in his denunciation of many aspects [?] of Stalin&#39;s bureaucratic
	regime that the Soviet Communist Party was to unmask [?] in 1956, the Trotskyist claim
	appears plausible. However, as we shall see the truth is considerably more complex.&quot;
	(<em>Cogito</em>, page 19)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>

Indeed, the truth is &quot;considerably more complex&quot;! What sort of
&quot;unmasking&quot; was performed by Khruschev and Co. in 1956? That Stalin was a
tyrant, a slayer, a mass murderer, a madman, etc? That Khruschev, Brezhnev, Kosygin and
the others all stood trembling in their shoes before the dictatorship (as the Soviet
&quot;Communist&quot; Party apparently only &quot;discovered&quot; in 1956!) but for
Marxists the problem only begins there. What is more important are the social relations
which could produce such a monstrosity. And the vital question in relation to the
Twentieth Congress is: <em>What has changed since 1956?</em>
</p>

<p>
As early as 1920, Lenin saw the processes which were taking place in the Soviet state
apparatus. All his material on the Trade Union question, which is not dealt with by Monty
Johnstone, is concerned with the idea of the workers and their organisations as a check on
the bureaucracy, its accumulative tendencies, corruption, waste, and mismanagement. Lenin
saw the development of a healthy workers democracy and of the gradual withering away of
the state as indispensable for the movement towards socialism.

</p>

<p>
For Monty Johnstone, to judge from his boundless admiration of Khruschev&#39;s
&quot;unmasking&quot; activities, Russia and Eastern Europe are now healthy socialist
countries, busily eliminating all traces of bureaucratism, cult of personality, and
Stalinism generally - with the exception of a number of &quot;regrettable&quot; (and,
apparently, inexplicable) incidents such as the invasion of Czechoslovakia and the
frame-up trials of the writers, which, evidently bear no relation at all to the general
state of affairs!
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone&#39;s quotation from Lenin on the bureaucratisation of the state and the
role of the unions must have been made tongue in cheek.
</p>

<p>
Since 1956, the Russian bureaucracy has been forced to remove a number of the most
barbaric practices of the Stalin regime - practices, which under capitalism, would only be
possible in a fascist state - such as slave-labour, etc. But for all that, the
police-state and the terror remain; only the names have changed. The situation with regard
to the trade unions in Russia shows the complete falsity of the assertion that the
bureaucracy is reforming itself out of existence. We ask Monty Johnstone: <em>Thirteen
years after the Twentieth Congress, where are the independent trade unions in the Soviet
Union?</em>

</p>

<p>
Under Stalin, the elementary rights of the Soviet working class were taken away. Today,
under his heirs, Brezhnev and Kosygin, there is <em>no right to strike, no right to
collective bargaining, no right to elect democratic factory committees </em>(rights which
existed under Lenin and Trotsky, even in the blackest period of the Civil War). The trade
unions in Russia and Eastern Europe are a caricature: a belt for the transmission to the
working class of the orders of the bureaucratic overlords. The monstrous corruption, waste
and mismanagement which Lenin wished to hold in check by means of the workers&#39;
organisations, has today reached proportions which threaten to undermine the advances made
by the Soviet working class on the basis of the planned economy.<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
It is a crying contradiction, which any thinking member of the Young Communist League
or Communist Party will see, that the weak, embattled Soviet Republic at the time of Lenin
and Trotsky, <em>despite </em>the bureaucratic deformations to which Lenin honestly refers,
nevertheless guaranteed the freedom and independence of both the trade unions and the
Party. Young Communist Leaguers should take the trouble to read the material of the Tenth
Party Congress in Lenin&#39;s <em>Works </em>and ask themselves honestly: could such a free
discussion of the issues take place in <em>any</em> &quot;Communist&quot; Party today?

</p>

<p>
In contrast to the period of Civil War and NEP, when the Bolsheviks were forced by the
weakness of the Soviet power and the threat of capitalist restoration to restrict certain
democratic rights as a temporary, emergency measure, the Soviet Union today is the second
industrial nation in the world. And yet, the bureaucracy is terrified at the prospect of
granting even the most basic democratic rights to the Soviet workers. Thus in
Czechoslovakia, the relative independence of the trade unions which the workers wrested
from the bureaucracy after the fall of Novotny, provoked the boot of Russian reaction. So
afraid were the Brezhnevs and Kosygins of the effect this would have on the Soviet working
class!
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone&#39;s attempt to pose as the friend of the &quot;freedom of labour&quot;
against the &quot;arch-bureaucrat&quot; Trotsky sounds all the more hollow when one
compares the situation in the Soviet Union today to even Franco&#39;s Spain. There, too,
certain &quot;concessions&quot; have been granted to the working class, out of fear of
revolution. The difference is that whereas even in Spain, where the trade unions are
illegal, the workers, have set up genuine organisation - the illegal &quot;Workers&#39;

Commissions&quot;, which conduct strikes and struggle on behalf of the class and even
negotiate with the bosses, in &quot;Socialist&quot; Russia, anyone who attempted to
organise on these lines would soon find himself behind bars.
</p>

<p>
In reality, mirrored in the trade union issue is the whole question of social relations
in the Soviet Union and the other bureaucratically deformed worker&#39;s states. To talk about
advancing to socialism (or &quot;Communism&quot;!) implies the full, free development of
the working class as the ruling class in society controlling, checking and accounting. It
means the involvement of the whole of society in the planning and running of industry and
of the state, with the corresponding melting away of bureaucracy. This is the only
guarantee of the transition to a classless society. Socialist planning needs the check of
workers&#39; democracy as the human body needs oxygen.
</p>

<p>
The bureaucratic, totalitarian set-up in the USSR is not only oppressive to the Soviet
working class and repellent to the workers of the West. It is also increasingly an
impediment to the free and harmonious development of the productive forces in the Soviet
Union. It is a crushing indictment of the caricature of socialism that, fifty years after
the October Revolution, the workers lack even those elements of democracy which are
present in advanced capitalist countries. While the bureaucracy boasts of &quot;building
Communism&quot; the death-penalty had been reintroduced - for economic offences - such is
the extent of swindling, corruption and theft which bedevils the Soviet economy - a
concrete proof of the bankruptcy of the regime and the need for workers&#39; democracy. The
Soviet workers will inevitably come to understand that the only way out for them is the
programme of Lenin and Trotsky. When they realise that, they <em>will </em>realise it, the
days of the bureaucracy will be numbered.

</p>

<h4>The Tenth Party Congress and the NEP</h4>
<p>
The Tenth Party Congress took place in an atmosphere of crisis; the period of &quot;War
Communism&quot; had entered its last, most convulsive phase. Armed peasants uprisings took
place in a series of provinces, culminating in a serious insurrection in Tambov.
Discontent spread to the hungry towns. In February, 1921 a series of strikes broke out in
Petrograd because of the shortage of bread. Menshevik elements took advantage of the
unrest to put forward the counter-revolutionary slogan of &quot;Soviets without
Communists&quot;.
</p>

<p>
In this context as Lenin said, the debate on the Trade Unions was an
&quot;impermissible luxury&quot;, which was &quot;pushing to the forefront a question
which for objective reasons cannot be there.&quot; The real point at issue was not the
immediate question of the trade unions - but this served as a catalyst which crystallised
a number of clearly defined tendencies within the party.

</p>

<p>
The end of the Civil War, and especially the demobilisation of the Red Army, deepened
the crisis and discontent of the peasant masses. Lenin explained that certain opposition
currents in the party were &quot;bound up with the tremendous preponderance of peasants in
the country, with their dissatisfaction with the proletarian dictatorship.&quot; The
question of the trade unions shrank before these issues which exploded in the middle of
the Congress in the Kronstadt uprising.
</p>

<p>
The Kronstadt uprising undoubtedly reflected the growing mood of disillusionment with
War Communism among the masses, first and foremost of the more backward and peasant
elements, but increasingly among workers whose morale had been undermined by years of war,
civil war and famine. Faced with the implacable opposition of the peasant masses, the
revolution was forced to retreat. The requisition of grain was abolished and replaced by a
tax, and measures were taken to restore the market economy, to encourage a measure of
private trade. Certain industries were even denationalised, but the major levers of the
economy, the banks, insurance companies, the large industries, together with the monopoly
of foreign trade, remained in the hands of the state.
</p>

<p>
These concessions to bourgeois &quot;freedom&quot; were not made light-heartedly as a
victory over the &quot;arch-bureaucracy&quot; of War Communism, but as a retreat under
pressure, as temporary concessions granted to the petty-bourgeois masses in order to
prevent a split between the workers and peasants which would lead to the fall of Soviet
power.

</p>

<p>
Defending these concessions at the Tenth Congress, Lenin referred to the crushing
pressure of the peasant masses on the working class as &quot;a far greater danger than all
the Denikins, Kolchaks, and Yudenichs put together. It would be fatal,&quot; he continued,
&quot;to be deluded on this score! The difficulties stemming from the petty-bourgeois
element are enormous, and if they are to be overcome, we must have greater unity, and I
don&#39;t just mean a resemblance of unity. We must all pull together with a single will, for
in a peasant country only the will of the mass of the proletarians will enable the
proletariat to accomplish the great task of its leadership and dictatorship. Assistance is
on its way from the Western European countries but it is not coming quickly enough. Still
it is coming and growing.&quot; (<em>Works</em>, vol. 32, page 179)
</p>

<p>
Lenin, as always, put the matter clearly and honestly. The retreat of the NEP had been
dictated by the enormous pressure of the peasantry on the workers&#39; state, isolated by the
delay of the socialist revolution in the West. Lenin always referred to it as a temporary
state of affairs, a &quot;breathing space&quot;, before the next dramatic developments of
the international socialist revolution. But he was also acutely aware of the dangers that
lay on that road, especially the dangers of a revival of the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois
elements with the growth of the market economy:

</p>

<p>
&quot;This peril - the development of small production and of the petty-bourgeois in
the rural areas - is an extremely serious one,&quot; Lenin warned the Tenth Congress. In
answer to those who were inclined to complacency, Lenin emphasised the point: &quot;Do we
have classes? Yes we do. Do we have a class struggle? Yes and a most furious one!&quot; (<em>Works</em>,
vol. 32, page 212)
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone gives a completely one-sided account of the Tenth Congress, heavily
emphasising the trade union question, omitting all references to the main issues involved,
and dealing with the trade union question in a one-sided manner - posing the question once
more as a &quot;battle royal&quot; between Lenin and Trotsky, while failing to mention the
other positions advanced - of Bukharin, the so-called &quot;Workers&#39; Opposition&quot; and
the &quot;Democratic Centralists&quot;, for instance. Yet again, these omissions enable
Monty Johnstone to create a completely false impression. The sheer cynicism of his
approach can best be seen from his attempt to identify Trotsky&#39;s position on the trade
unions with the decision of the Congress to ban factions in the Party:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Organising a faction around the ideas expressed in his pamphlet&#8230;he [Trotsky]
	launched a debate in the Party, culminating at the Tenth Congress in March 1921, in his
	overwhelming defeat and a decision to ban factions in the Party.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>,
	page 20)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
This is news indeed! No one at the Tenth Congress ever accused Trotsky of
&quot;organising a faction&quot; around anything. This particular piece of Johnstonian
innuendo is evidently meant to link-up with Lenin&#39;s polemical rejoinder about Trotsky&#39;s
earlier &quot;factionalism&quot; (i.e. his refusal to join the committee to investigate
the Trade Unions). Johnstone knows perfectly well that the decision to ban factions was
taken for reasons not connected with either the trade union discussion or Trotsky&#39;s role
in that discussion.

</p>

<p>
The reasons are given in the passage quoted from Lenin above, which clearly explains
that this extraordinary measure was <em>dictated by the dangers of alien class pressure
expressing themselves through groups in the Party. </em>In the immediate context of the
Tenth Congress, the measure was directed, not against Trotsky, but expressly against the
so-called &quot;Workers&#39; Opposition&quot;, a quasi-syndicalist group led by Shlyapoikov
and Kollontai, which was formally dissolved by the Congress. The resolution on this point
clearly explains the reasons for the measure:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;The said deviation is due partly to the influx into the party of former
	Mensheviks, and also of workers and peasants who have not yet fully assimilated the
	communist world outlook. Mainly, however, this deviation is due to the influence exercised
	upon the proletariat and on the Russian Communist Party by the petty-bourgeois element,
	which is exceptionally strong in our country and which inevitably engenders vacillation
	towards anarchism, particularly at times when the condition of the masses has greatly
	deteriorated as a consequence of the crop failure and the devastating effects of war, and
	when the demobilisation of the army numbering millions sets loose thousands of peasants
	and workers, unable immediately to find regular means of livelihood.&quot; (<em>Works</em>,
	vol. 32, page 245)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Precisely in the debate on the &quot;Workers&#39; Opposition&quot;, Lenin made a statement
which completely gives the lie to the innuendoes of Monty Johnstone about Trotsky&#39;s
alleged &quot;factionalism&quot;:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;The Workers&#39; Opposition said: &#39;Lenin and Trotsky will unite.&#39; Trotsky came out
	and said: &#39;Those who fail to understand that it is necessary to unite are against the
	Party; of course we will unite, because we are men of the Party.&#39; I supported him. Of
	course, Comrade Trotsky and I differed; and when more or less equal groups appear within
	the Central Committee, the Party will pass judgement, and in such a way that will make us
	unite in accordance with the Party&#39;s will and instructions.&quot; (<em>Works</em>, vol. 32,
	page 204)
	</p>
