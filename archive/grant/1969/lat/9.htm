   <h1>Lenin and Trotsky&mdash;What They Really Stood For</h1>
   <hr />
   <h4>Chapter 9</h4>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
It is easier to write distortions than to answer them. In the present work, we have
only managed to deal with the most blatant falsehoods and misrepresentations. But, in
fact, the <em>entire method</em> of Monty Johnstone&#39;s <em>Cogito </em>article is <em>alien to
Marxism</em>. It is not designed to make clear the position of Trotsky, in order to answer
it. It falsifies Trotsky&#39;s ideas, in order to subject them to surreptitious ridicule. Such
an approach has nothing to do with the method of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky, who
always gave a clear and honest characterisation of the ideas of their opponents, in order
to answer them.
</p>

<p>
But the final bankruptcy of Monty Johnstone&#39;s position is revealed by a phrase which
slips, almost unnoticed, from his pen:

</p>

<p>
&quot;A fundamental Marxist criticism of Stalinism,&quot; he writes on page 33,
&quot;which still remains to be made, will not proceed from Trotsky&#39;s premises&#8230;&quot;
</p>

<p>
So there we have it! &quot;The Mountain hath laboured and borne&#8230;a mouse!&quot; <em>Sixteen
years after the death of Stalin, thirteen years after the Twentieth Congress, and Monty
Johnstone&#39;s &quot;fundamental criticism of Stalinism&quot; has yet to be made!</em>

</p>

<p>
Such is the incredible conclusion which Young Communist Leaguers and Communist Party
members are expected to take from the &quot;theoreticians&quot; of their movement.
Trotsky&#39;s &quot;model&quot; is &quot;fundamentally false&quot;, but as for <em>our </em>model
- well, we are still waiting for that to materialise!
</p>

<p>
For our part, we invite members of the Communist Party and Young Communist League to
draw their own conclusions from the lame excuses of the Monty Johnstones. Put the question
to the leadership: <em>Why </em>can&#39;t you provide us with an analysis and explanation of
Stalinism? <em>Why </em>don&#39;t the Soviet leaders produce an analysis? Alas! No reply will be
forthcoming. At this very moment, the Soviet &quot;comrades&quot; are busily resurrecting
Stalin, and taking back even those meagre concessions that were wrested from their grasp
in the fifties. Of course, tomorrow, Brezhnev will be ousted and some

&quot;progressive&quot; bureaucrat will again grant concessions, to prevent the workers
from moving into struggle. In fact, the bureaucracy will do <em>anything </em>for the
workers, <em>anything, except get of their backs!</em>
</p>

<p>
It is clear that the present discussion was not welcomed by the Communist Party
leadership. They tried to put it off as long as possible. But with their new,
&quot;independent&quot;, &quot;democratic&quot;, &quot;respectable&quot; image at stake,
they dared not continue to veto it. The events which have rocked World Stalinism in recent
years have opened up broad discussions in the ranks of the Communist Parties. Any attempt
on the part of the bureaucracy to clamp down on, say, the discussion on Czechoslovakia,
would have led to a debacle on the lines of 1956. Their hand has been forced by events.

</p>

<p>
The sell-out of the movement of the French workers by the Stalinist leadership gave
rise to widespread protest and opposition among the Communist Party rank and file, who,
unlike the leaders, have not lost their class-consciousness and their desire to change
society. Likewise in Britain, the events in France and Czechoslovakia have set the most
conscious members of the Young Communist League and Communist Party thinking about the
fundamental questions which face the movement. Similar developments are undoubtedly taking
place in the Italian and other Communist Parties.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday, Stalinism was shaken by Hungary and Czechoslovakia, by France and the
Sino-Soviet split. What will come tomorrow? The coming period opens up the prospect of new
and terrible class battles on an international scale. Under the cover of the post-war
boom, new, fresh forces have been prepared which are untainted by the despair and cynicism
of the older generation. The magnificent struggles of the Italian and French working class
provide an auger of things to come. The question now is only which will come first - the
socialist revolution in the West, or the political revolution in the East?
</p>

<p>
In the white-heat of great events, the new forces of the revolution will be formed and
tested. A large part of these forces, especially in France and Italy, but also in Britain,
will come from the Communist Parties and the Young Communist Leagues. It is the duty of
all comrades in these organisations to prepare themselves theoretically for the great
tasks which face us. Theory is not something which the Party &quot;intellectuals&quot;
hand down on a plate. All real Marxists must struggle to train and educate themselves in
the basic ideas, methods, and traditions of Marxism. The writings of Marx, Engels, Lenin
and Trotsky are not dry, academic, and irrelevant, but contain the living lessons of the
experience of the working class movement of all countries over a century and a half. If
members of the Communist Party and Young Communist League desire to play a role in
building the movement which will change society on socialist lines, they must take this
task seriously.
</p>

<p>
On the basis of events, and the creation of Marxist, of Bolshevik cadres, to
participate in the inevitable movements of the working class in Britain and
internationally, victory is, in the last analysis, assured in the struggle for a united,
harmonious Socialist World Federation. The nightmare of Stalinism and capitalism will
become bad memories of the past, and the blossoming of the productive forces of the
planet, integrated under a system of democratic control and planning, will enable art,
culture and science to rise to unheard of levels. For the first time, Man will be able to
draw himself up to his true stature in a world freed from wars, poverty and oppression.
