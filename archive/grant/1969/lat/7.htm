   <h3>Lenin&#39;s Struggle Against Bureaucracy</h3>


<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;In the last period of his life Lenin was desperately concerned about the growth
	of bureaucracy in the Soviet state and in the Party.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>, page 22)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Monty Johnstone, having given one paragraph to the Russian Revolution, and one
paragraph to the Civil War, maintains his &quot;balance&quot; by granting an equal amount
of space to Lenin&#39;s struggle against the forces of internal reaction in the Soviet state
and party.

</p>

<p>
How did Lenin deal with the question of the Soviet bureaucracy? Did he simply remain
&quot;desperately concerned&quot; about it? Or did he attempt something which our
&quot;theoreticians&quot; of the Communist Parties today persistently avoid, namely an <em>analysis
of the causes of bureaucracy in order to wage an implacable struggle against it</em>?
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone refers to &quot;bureaucracy&quot; as if it were simply a matter of

&quot;bureaucratic behaviour&quot;, excessive red-tape, officialdom, etc. Such an approach
has nothing in common with the Marxist method, which explains bureaucracy as a social
phenomenon, which arises for definite reasons. Lenin, approaching the question as a
Marxist, explained the rise of bureaucracy as a <em>parasitic, capitalist growth on the
organism of the workers&#39; state, which arose out of the isolation of the revolution in a
backward, illiterate peasant country.</em>
</p>

<p>
In one of his last articles, <em>Better Fewer But Better</em>, Lenin wrote:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>

	&quot;Our state apparatus is so deplorable, not to say wretched, that we must first
	think very carefully how to combat its defects, bearing in mind that these defects are
	rooted in the past, which, although it has been overthrown, has not yet been overcome, not
	yet reached the stage of a culture that has receded into the past.&quot; (<em>Works</em>,
	vol. 33, page 487)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
The October revolution had overthrown the old order, ruthlessly suppressed and purged
the Tsarist state; but in conditions of chronic economic and cultural backwardness, the
elements of the old order were everywhere creeping back into positions of privilege and
power in the measure that the revolutionary wave ebbed back with the defeats of the
international revolution. <em>Engels explained that in every society where art, science and
government are the exclusive of a privileged minority, then that minority will always use
and abuse its positions in its own interests. </em>And this state of affairs is inevitable,
so long as the vast majority of the people are forced to toil for long hours in industry
and agriculture for the bare necessities of life.
</p>

<p>
After the revolution, with the ruined condition of industry, the working day was not
reduced, but lengthened. Workers toiled ten, twelve hours and more a day on subsistence
rations; many worked weekends without pay voluntarily. But, as Trotsky explained, the
masses can only sacrifice their &quot;today&quot; for their &quot;tomorrow&quot; up to a
very definite limit. Inevitably, the strain of war, of revolution, of four years of bloody
Civil War, of a famine in which five million perished, all served to undermine the working
class in terms of both numbers and morale.

</p>

<p>
The NEP stabilised the economy, but created new dangers by encouraging the growth of
small capitalism, especially in the countryside where the rich &quot;kulaks&quot; gained
ground at the expense of the poor peasants. Industry revived, but, being tied to the
demand of the peasantry, especially the rich peasants, the revival was confined almost
entirely to light industry (consumer goods). Heavy industry, the key to socialist
construction, stagnated. By 1922 there were two million unemployed m the towns. At the
Ninth Congress of Soviets in December, 1921, Lenin remarked:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Excuse me, but what do you describe as the proletariat? That class of labourers
	which is employed by large-scale industry. But where is this large-scale industry? What
	sort of proletariat is this? Where is your industry? Why is it idle?&quot; (<em>Works</em>,
	vol. 33, page 174)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
In a speech at the Eleventh Party Congress in March, 1922, Lenin pointed out that the
class nature of many who worked in the factories at this time was non-proletarian; that
many were dodgers from military service, peasants and de-classed elements:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;During the war people who were by no means proletarians went into the factories;
	they went into the factories to dodge war. And are the social and economic conditions in
	our country today such as to induce real proletarians to go into the factories? No. It
	would be true according to Marx; but Marx did not write about Russia; he wrote about
	capitalism as a whole, beginning with the fifteenth century. It held true over a period of
	six hundred years, but it is not true for present-day Russia. Very often those who go into
	the factories are not proletarians; they are casual elements of every description.&quot; (<em>Works</em>,
	vol. 33, page 299)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
The disintegration of the working class, the loss of many of the most advanced elements
in the Civil War, the influx of backward elements from the countryside, and the
demoralisation and exhaustion of the masses was one side of the picture. On the other
side, the forces of reaction, those petty bourgeois and bourgeois elements who had been
temporarily demoralised and driven underground by the success of the revolution in Russia
and internationally, everywhere began to recover their nerve, thrust themselves to the
fore, taking advantage of the situation to insinuate themselves into every nook and cranny
of the ruling bodies of industry, of the state and even of the Party.

</p>

<p>
Immediately after the seizure of power, the only political party which was suppressed
by the Bolsheviks was the fascist Black Hundreds. Even the bourgeois Cadet Party was not
immediately illegalised. The government itself was a coalition of Bolsheviks and Left
Social-Revolutionaries. But, under the pressure of the Civil War, a sharp polarisation of
class forces took place in which the Mensheviks, SRs and &quot;Left SRs&quot; came out on
the side of the counter-revolution. Contrary to their own intention, the Bolsheviks were
forced to introduce a monopoly of political power. This monopoly, which was regarded as an
extraordinary and temporary state of affairs, created enormous dangers in the situation
where the proletarian vanguard was coming under increasing pressure from alien classes.
</p>

<p>
In February, 1917, the Bolshevik Party had no more than 23,000 members in the whole of
Russia. At the height of the Civil War, when party membership involved personal risk, the
ranks were thrown open to the workers, who pushed the membership to 200,000. But as the
war grew to a close, the party membership actually trebled reflecting an influx of
careerists and elements from hostile classes and parties.
</p>

<p>
Lenin at this time repeatedly emphasised the danger of the Party succumbing to the
pressures and moods of the petty-bourgeois masses; that the main enemy of the revolution
was:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;everyday economics in a small-peasant country with a ruined large industry. He is
	the petty-bourgeois element which surrounds us like the air, and penetrates deep into the
	ranks of the proletariat. And the proletariat is de-classed, i.e. dislodged from its class
	groove. The factories and mills are idle - the proletariat is weak, scattered, enfeebled.
	On the other hand the petty-bourgeois element within the country is backed by the whole
	international bourgeoisie, which retains its power throughout the world.&quot; (<em>Works</em>,
	vol. 33, page 23)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
The &quot;purge&quot; initiated by Lenin in 1921 had nothing in common with the
monstrous frame-up trials of Stalin; there was no police, no trials, no prison-camps;
merely the ruthless weeding out of petty-bourgeois and Menshevik elements from the ranks
of the Party, in order <em>to preserve the ideas and traditions of October from the
poisonous effects of petty-bourgeois reaction. By </em>early 1922, some 200,000 members
(one-third of the membership) had been expelled.
</p>

<p>
Lenin&#39;s correspondence and writings of this period. when illness was increasingly
preventing him from intervene in the struggle; clearly indicate his alarm at the
encroachment of the Soviet bureaucracy, the insolent parvenus in every corner of the state
apparatus. Thus, in a letter to Sheinman in February, 1922:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;At present the State Bank is a bureaucratic power game. There is the truth for
	you, if you want to hear not the sweet communist-official lies (with which everyone feeds
	you as a high mandarin), but the <em>truth</em>. And if you do not want to look at this
	truth with open eyes, through all the communist lying, you are a man who has perished in
	the prime of life in a swamp of official lying. Now that is an unpleasant truth, but it is
	the truth.&quot; (<em>Works</em>, vol. 36, page 567)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Contrast this fearless honesty of Lenin with all the saccharine falsehoods with which <em>all
</em>the Communist Party leaders and &quot;theoreticians&quot; fed the international
communist movement about the Soviet Union for generations, and judge for yourself the
depths of degradation in which the self-styled &quot;Friends of the Soviet Union&quot;
have plunged the ideas and traditions of Lenin! Again, in a letter dated April 12, 1922:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;The more such work is done, the deeper we go into living practice, distracting
	the attention of both ourselves and our readers from the stinking bureaucratic and
	stinking intellectual Moscow (and, in general, Soviet bourgeois) atmospheres, the greater
	will be our success in improving both our press and all our constructive work.&quot; (<em>Works</em>,
	vol. 36, page 579)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
At the Eleventh Congress, Lenin placed before the Party a searing indictment of
bureaucratisation of the state apparatus:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;If we take Moscow,&quot; he said, &quot;with its 4,700 Communists in responsible
	positions, and if we take the huge bureaucratic machine, that gigantic heap, we must ask:
	who is directing whom? I doubt very much whether it can be truthfully said that the
	Communists are directing that heap. <em>To tell the truth, they are not directing, they are
	being directed</em>.&quot; (<em>Works</em>, vol. 33, page 288, our emphasis)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
To carry out the work of weeding bureaucrats and careerists out of the state and party
apparatus, Lenin initiated the setting up of RABKRIN (the Workers&#39; and Peasants&#39;
Inspectorate) with Stalin in charge. Lenin saw the need for a strong organiser to see that
this work was carried out thoroughly; Stalin&#39;s record as a party organiser appeared to
qualify him for the post. Within in a few years, Stalin occupied a number of
organisational posts in the Party: head of RABKRIN, member of the Central Committee and
Politburo, Orgburo and Secretariat. But his narrow, organisational outlook and personal
ambition led Stalin to occupy the post, in a short space of time, as the chief spokesman
of bureaucracy in the party leadership, not as its opponent.
</p>

<p>
As early as 1920, Trotsky criticised the working of RABKRIN, which from a tool in the
struggle against bureaucracy was becoming itself a hotbed of bureaucracy. Initially, Lenin
defended RABKRIN against Trotsky. His illness prevented him from realising what was going
on behind his back in the state and party. Stalin used his position, which enabled him to
select personnel to leading posts in the state and party to quietly gather round himself a
bloc of allies and yes-men, political nonentities who were grateful to him for their
advancement. In his hands, RABKRIN became an instrument for building up his own position
and eliminating his political rivals.
</p>

<p>
Lenin only became aware of the terrible situation when he discovered the truth about
Stalin&#39;s handling of relations with Georgia. Without the knowledge of Lenin or the
Politburo, Stalin, together with his henchmen Dzerzhinsky and Ordzhonikidze, had carried
out a <em>coup d&#39;etat </em>in Georgia. The finest cadres of Georgian Bolshevism were purged,
and the party leaders denied access to Lenin, who was fed a string of lies by Stalin. When
he finally found out what was happening, Lenin was furious. From his sick-bed late in 1922
he dictated a series of notes to his stenographer on &quot;the notorious questions of
autonomisation, which, it appears, is officially called the question of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics&quot;. 

</p>

<p>
Lenin&#39;s notes are a crushing indictment of the bureaucratic and chauvinist arrogance of
Stalin and his clique. But Lenin does not treat this incident as an accidental phenomenon
- a &quot;regrettable mistake&quot;, like the invasion of Czechoslovakia, or a
&quot;tragedy&quot;, like the crushing of the Hungarian worker&#39;s commune, but <em>the
expression of the rotten, reactionary nationalism of the Soviet bureaucracy. </em>It is
worth quoting Lenin&#39;s words on the state apparatus at length.
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;It is said that a united state apparatus was needed. Where did that assurance
	come from? Did it not come from the same Russian apparatus, which, as I pointed out in one
	of the preceding sections of my diary, we took over from Tsarism and slightly anointed
	with Soviet oil?
	</p>


	<p>
	&quot;There is no doubt that that measure should have been delayed until we could say,
	that we vouched for our apparatus as our own. But now, we must, in all conscience, admit
	the contrary; <em>the state apparatus we call ours is, in fact, still quite alien to us; it
	is a bourgeois and Tsarist hotchpotch and there has been no possibility of getting rid of
	it in the past five years without the help of other countries and because we have been
	&quot;busy&quot; most of the time with military engagements and the fight against famine.</em>
	</p>

	<p>
	&quot;It is quite natural that in such circumstances the &#39;freedom to secede from the
	union&#39; by which we justify ourselves will be a mere scrap of paper, unable to defend the
	non-Russians from the onslaught of that really Russian man, the Great-Russian chauvinist,
	in substance a rascal and a tyrant, such as the typical Russian bureaucrat is. <em>There is
	no doubt that the infinitesimal percentage of Soviet and sovietised workers will drown in
	that tide of chauvinistic Great-Russian riff-raff like a fly in milk</em>.&quot; (<em>Works</em>,
	vol. 36, page 605, our emphasis)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
After the Georgian affair, Lenin threw the whole weight of his authority behind the
struggle to remove Stalin from the post of General Secretary of the party which he
occupied in 1922, after the death of Sverdlov. However, Lenin&#39;s main fear now more than
ever was that an open split in the leadership, under prevailing conditions, might lead to
the break-up of the party along class lines. He therefore attempted to keep the struggle
confined to the leadership, and the notes and other material were not made public. Lenin
wrote secretly to the Georgian Bolshevik-Leninists (sending copies to Trotsky and Kamenev)
taking up their cause against Stalin &quot;with all my heart&quot;. As he was unable to
pursue the affair in person, he wrote to Trotsky requesting him to undertake the defence
of the Georgians in the Central Committee.
</p>

<p>
Needless to say, the documentary evidence of Lenin&#39;s last fight against Stalin and the
bureaucracy has been suppressed for decades. Lenin&#39;s last writings were hidden from the
Communist Party rank-and-file in Russia and internationally. Lenin&#39;s last letter to the
Party Congress, despite the protests of his widow, was not read out at the Congress and
remained under lock and key until 1956 when Khruschev and Co. published it. along with a
few other items (including the letters on Georgia) as part of their campaign to throw the
blame for all that had happened in the past thirty years on to Stalin&#39;s shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone and his like sneer at the material of Lenin - letters, minutes, etc -
suppressed by the Soviet bureaucracy, which has been published in the West &quot;on
Trotsky&#39;s authority&quot;. But the same wretched Jesuits of Stalinism also dismissed as

&quot;forgeries&quot; the Suppressed Testament and Lenin&#39;s last letters, published by
Trotskyists, not after the Twentieth Congress (of blessed memory) but <em>thirty years
before the Communist Party leaders were prepared to admit their existence. </em>Communist
Party members and Young Communist Leaguers must ask themselves honestly whose word they
prefer to take: that of Trotsky and his followers who told the truth about Lenin&#39;s
struggle against Stalinist bureaucracy and published works which the Communist Party
leaders had denied to their rank-and-file for a whole historical period, or that of Monty
Johnstone and his friends whose entire political past indicates their complete dishonesty
in regard to the heritage of Lenin and the history of the Russian revolution.
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone quotes odd passages from Lenin&#39;s Suppressed Testament, but nowhere does
he make clear what the content of that letter was. Lenin warns of the danger of a split in
the Party, because &quot;our party rests upon two classes, and for that reason its
instability is possible&#8230;&quot; Lenin did not see the disagreement between Trotsky and
Stalin as accidental, or flowing from &quot;personalities&quot; (although he gives a
series of penetrating sketches of the personal characteristics of the leading members of
the Party).

</p>

<p>
Lenin&#39;s last letter must be seen in the context of his other writings of the previous
few months, his attacks on bureaucracy and the bloc which he formed with Trotsky against
Stalin. Lenin worded his letter very cautiously (he had originally intended to be present
at the Congress for which according to his stenographer Fotieva, he had &quot;prepared a
bombshell for Stalin&quot;). For each of the leading members, he gives both the positive
and negative features of their character: in Trotsky&#39;s case, he refers to his
&quot;exceptional abilities&quot; (&quot;the most able man on the Central Committee at the
present time&quot;) but criticises him for his &quot;far-reaching self-confidence&quot;
and &quot;a tendency to be too much attracted by the purely administrative side of
affairs&quot; - faults which, however serious they may be in themselves, have nothing
whatsoever to do with the Permanent Revolution, &quot;Socialism in one Country&quot;, or
any of the other canards invented by the Stalinists.

</p>

<p>
In relation to Stalin, Lenin writes that &quot;Comrade Stalin having become General
Secretary, has concentrated enormous power in his hands, and I am not sure that he always
knows how to use that power with sufficient caution.&quot;
</p>

<p>
That is already a political question, and linked up with Lenin&#39;s struggle against the
bureaucracy <em>in the Party. </em>In <em>Better Fewer, But Better</em>, written
shortly before, Lenin commented: &quot;Let it be said in parentheses <em>that we have
bureaucrats in our Party offices as well as in Soviet offices</em>.&quot; In the
same work, he launched a sharp attack on RABKRIN, which was clearly meant for Stalin:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Let us say frankly that the People&#39;s Commissariat of the Workers&#39; and Peasants&#39;
	Inspection does not at present enjoy the slightest authority. Everybody knows that no
	other institutions are worse organised than those of our Workers&#39; and Peasants&#39; Inspection
	and that under present conditions nothing can be expected from this Peoples&#39;

	Commissariat.&quot; (<em>Works</em>, vol. 33, page 490)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
In a postscript to his letter, Lenin advocated the removal of Stalin from the post of
General Secretary, ostensibly on grounds of &quot;rudeness&quot; - but advocating his
replacement with a man &quot;who in all respects differs from Stalin only in superiority -
namely, more loyal, more polite and more attentive to comrades, less capricious,
etc.&quot; The diplomatic mode of expression does not conceal the indirect accusation,
very clear in the light of the Georgian events, of Stalin&#39;s rudeness, capriciousness and
disloyalty.

</p>

<p>
In presenting Lenin&#39;s Testament as a document merely concerned with the
&quot;personalities&quot; of the leaders, the Communist Party &quot;theoreticians&quot;
fall into a completely vulgar misrepresentation of Lenin. Even if the
&quot;Testament&quot; leaves room for ambiguity (it does not, except for slovenly minds)
the <em>whole body </em>of Lenin&#39;s last writings provide <em>a clear programmatic statement
of his position, </em>which cannot be distorted.

</p>

<p>
Repeatedly, Lenin characterised the bureaucracy as a<em> parasitic</em>,<em> bourgeois
growth</em> on the workers&#39; state, and an expression of the petty-bourgeois outlook - which
penetrated the State and even the Party.
</p>

<p>
The petty-bourgeois reaction against October was all the more difficult to combat
because of the exhausted state of the proletariat, sections of which were also becoming
demoralised. Nonetheless, Lenin and Trotsky saw the working class as the <em>only</em> basis
for a struggle against bureaucracy, and the maintenance of a healthy workers&#39; democracy as
the <em>only </em>check on it. Thus, in one article <em>Purging the Party </em>Lenin wrote:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Naturally, we shall not submit to everything the masses say because the masses,
	too, sometimes - particularly in time of exceptional weariness and exhaustion resulting
	from excessive hardship and suffering - yield to sentiments that are in no way advanced.
	But in appraising persons, in the negative attitude to those who have &quot;attached&quot;
	themselves to us for selfish motives, to those who have become &quot;puffed-up
	commissars&quot; and &quot;bureaucrats&quot;, the suggestions of the non-Party proletarian
	masses and, in many cases, of the non-Party peasant masses, are extremely valuable.&quot;
	(<em>Works</em>, vol. 33, page 39)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
The rise of bureaucracy was understood by Lenin as the product of economic and cultural
backwardness which was the result of the isolation of the revolution. The means of
combating this were linked, on the one hand, with the struggle for economic progress and
the gradual elimination of illiteracy, <em>which was linked inseparably with the struggle
to involve the working masses in the running of industry and the state. </em>Lenin and
Trotsky always relied upon the masses in the fight against the &quot;puffed-up
commissars&quot;. <em>Only by th</em>e <em>conscious self-activity of the working people
themselves could the transition to socialism be assured.</em>
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Lenin repeatedly explained that the terrible strains imposed upon
the working class by the isolation of the revolution in a backward country put
immense difficulties in the way of the creation of a really cultured, and harmonious,
classless society. Time and again Lenin stressed the problems that arose from the
isolation of the revolution. Monty Johnstone asserts that Lenin, towards the end of his
life, was coming to accept the position of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot;, citing as
proof of this the statement in <em>On Co-operation </em>that &quot;NEP Russia will be
transformed into socialist Russia&quot; since it possessed &quot;all that is necessary and
sufficient&quot; for building a socialist society. (<em>Cogito</em>, page 29)

</p>

<p>
Comrade Johnstone, after a desperate search through Lenin&#39;s <em>Selected Works</em>, can
find only <em>one </em>quotation which can be even vaguely interpreted as implying the
acceptance of the idea of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot;. Alas! the vagueness is
dispelled by even a cursory glance at the text of this rough, uncorrected document which
the Stalinists attempted, after Lenin&#39;s death, to summon to their aid. What Lenin is
referring to in this article is not the &quot;building of socialism&quot; within the
frontiers of the Tsarist empire, but the <em>social forms </em>which are necessary to carry
out the gradual elimination of the elements of &quot;state capitalism&quot; (NEP) and then
begin the tasks of <em>socialist construction </em>(electrification, industrialisation,
etc). Lenin&#39;s careful qualifications, which emphasise the absence of the <em>material </em>basis
for socialism, leave no doubt as to his position. Thus, referring to the need for a

&quot;cultural revolution&quot; for the overcoming of material backwardness (and therefore
of class conflicts in society) Lenin wrote:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;This cultural revolution would now suffice to make our country a completely
	socialist country; but it presents immense difficulties of a purely cultural (for we are
	illiterate) and material character (for to be cultured we must achieve a certain
	development of the material means of production, must have a certain material base).&quot;
	(<em>On Co-operation</em>,<em> Works</em>, vol. 33, page 475)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
To cover himself against possible misrepresentation, Lenin, in any case, explains that
he is dealing with the question of education <em>in abstraction from the problem of the
international position of the revolution</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;I should say that emphasis is shifting to educational work&#8230;<em>were it not
	for the fact that we have to fight for our position on a world scale. </em>If we leave that
	aside, however and confine ourselves to internal economic relations, the emphasis is
	shifting to education.&quot; (<em>ibid</em>, page 474)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Far from Lenin &quot;in the last period of his working life coming more and more in
practice&quot; to adopt the perspectives of Socialism in One Country, Lenin resolutely
explained that the difficulties of the revolution: the problems of backwardness, of
illiteracy, of bureaucracy <em>could only finally be overcome by the victory of the
socialist revolution in one or several advanced countries. </em>This perspective, which was
hammered home by Lenin hundreds of times from 1904-5 onwards, was accepted as a truism by
the entire Bolshevik Party up to 1924. In the last months of his life, Lenin never lost
sight of this fact. Among his last writings are a series of notes which made his position
abundantly clear:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;We have created a Soviet type of state,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and by that we have
	ushered in a new era in world history&quot; the era of the political rule of the
	proletariat, which is to supersede the era of bourgeois rule. Nobody can deprive us of
	this, either, although the Soviet type of state will have the finishing touches put to it
	only with the aid of the practical experience of the working class of several countries.
	</p>


	<p>
	&quot;But we have not finished building even the foundations of socialist economy and
	the hostile power of moribund capitalism can still deprive us of that. We must clearly
	appreciate this and frankly admit it; for there is nothing more dangerous than illusions
	(and vertigo, particularly at high altitudes). And there is absolutely nothing terrible,
	nothing that should give legitimate grounds for the slightest despondency, in admitting
	this bitter truth; <em>we have always urged and reiterated the elementary truth of Marxism
	- that the joint efforts of the workers of several advanced countries are needed for the
	victory of socialism</em>.&quot; (<em>Works</em>, vol. 33, page 206, our emphasis)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
In these lines of Lenin there is not an ounce of &quot;pessimism&quot; or of

&quot;underestimation&quot; of the creative capacities of the Soviet working class. In all
the writings of Lenin, and especially of this period, there is at once a burning faith in
the ability of the working people to change society and a fearless honesty in dealing with
difficulties. The difference in the attitudes of Stalinism and Leninism towards the
working class lies precisely in this: that the former seeks to deceive the masses with
&quot;official&quot; lies and smug illusions about the building of &quot;Socialism in One
Country&quot; in order to lull them into passive acceptance of the leadership of the
bureaucracy, while the latter strives to develop the consciousness of the working class,
never patronising it with lies and fairy-stories, but always revealing unpalatable truths,
in the full confidence that the working class will understand and accept the need for the
greatest sacrifices, provided the reasons for them are explained honestly and truthfully.
</p>

<p>
The arguments of Lenin were designed, not to stupefy the Soviet workers with
&quot;socialist opium&quot;, but to steel them for the struggles ahead - for the struggle
against backwardness and bureaucracy in Russia and for the struggle against capitalism and
for the socialist revolution on a world scale. It was the sympathy of the working people
of the world, Lenin explained, that prevented the imperialists from strangling the Russian
Revolution in 1917-20. <em>But the only real safeguard for the future of the Soviet
Republic was the extension of the Revolution to the capitalist countries of the West.</em>
</p>


<p>
At the Eleventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party - the last which Lenin attended
- he emphasised repeatedly the dangers to the State and Party arising out of the pressures
of backwardness and bureaucracy. Commenting on the direction of the State, Lenin warned:

	<p>
	&quot;Well, we have lived through a year, the state is in our hands, but has it
	operated the New Economic Policy in the way we wanted in the past year? No. But we refuse
	to admit that it did not operate in the way we wanted. How did it operate? The machine
	refused to obey the hand that guided it. It was like a car that was going not in the
	direction the driver desired but in the direction someone else desired; as if it were
	being driven by some mysterious, lawless hand, God knows whose, perhaps of a profiteer, or
	of a private capitalist, or of both. <em>Be that as it may, the car is not going quite in
	the direction the man at the wheel imagines, and often it goes in an altogether different
	direction</em>.&quot; (<em>Works</em>, vol. 33, page 179, our emphasis)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>

At the same Congress Lenin explained, in a very clear and unambiguous language, the
possibility of the degeneration of the revolution as a result of the pressure of alien
classes. Already the most farsighted sections of the &eacute;migr&eacute; bourgeoisie, the <em>Smena
Vekh </em>group of Ustryalov, were openly placing their hopes upon the
bureaucratic-bourgeois tendencies manifesting themselves in Soviet society, as a step in
the direction of capitalist restoration. The same group was later to applaud and encourage
the Stalinists in their struggle against &quot;Trotskyism&quot;. The <em>Smena Vekh </em>group,
which Lenin gave credit for its class insight, correctly understood the struggle of Stalin
against Trotsky, not in terms of &quot;personalities&quot; but as a <em>class question</em>,
as a step away from the revolutionary traditions of October.

</p>

<p>
&quot;The machine no longer obeyed the driver&quot; - the State was no longer under the
control of the Communists, of the workers, but was increasingly raising itself above
society. Referring to the views of <em>Smena Vekh</em>, Lenin said:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;We must say frankly that the things Ustryalov speaks about are possible, history
	knows all sorts of metamorphoses. Relying on firmness of convictions, loyalty, and other
	splendid moral qualities is anything but a serious attitude in politics. A few people may
	be endowed with splendid moral qualities, but historical issues are decided by vast
	masses, which, if the few do not suit them, may at times treat them none too
	politely.&quot; (<em>Works</em>, vol. 33, page 287)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
In these words of Lenin we find the defeat of the Left Opposition explained in advance
with a million times more clarity than in all the pretentious theorising of the
&quot;intellectuals&quot; about the relative psychological, moral and personal attributes
of Trotsky and Stalin. The State power was slipping out of the hands of the Communists,
not because of their personal failings or psychological peculiarities, but <em>because of
the enormous pressures of backwardness, of bureaucracy, of alien e/ass forces, which
weighed down upon the tiny handful of advanced, socialist workers and crushed them.</em>
</p>

<p>
Lenin likened the relationship of the Soviet workers and their advanced guard to the
bureaucracy and the petty-bourgeois end capitalist elements to that of a conquering and
conquered nation. History has shown repeatedly that for one nation to defeat another by
force of arms is not of itself, a sufficient guarantee of victory. <em>In the event of the
cultural level of the victors being lower than that of the vanquished, the latter will
impose its culture upon the conquerors. </em>Given the low level of culture of the weak
Soviet working class, surrounded by a sea of small property owners, the pressures were
enormous. They reflected themselves not only in the State, but inevitably in the Party
itself, <em>which became the centre of the struggle of conflicting class interests.</em>
</p>

<p>

Only in the light of all this can we understand Lenin&#39;s position in the struggle
against bureaucracy, his attitude to Stalin, and the contents of his <em>Suppressed
Testament. </em>That document expresses his conviction that the struggle between Trotsky
and Stalin is &quot;not a detail, or is a detail which can acquire a decisive
significance&quot;, in the light of the fact that &quot;Our party is based upon two
classes.&quot; In a letter written shortly before the Eleventh Party Congress, Lenin
explained the significance of conflicts and splits in the leadership in these words:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;If we do not close our eyes to reality we must admit that at the present time the
	proletarian policy of the Party is not determined by the character of its membership, but
	by the enormous undivided prestige enjoyed by the small group which might be called the
	Old Guard of the Party. A slight conflict within this group will be enough, if not to
	destroy this prestige, at all events to weaken the group to such a degree as to rob it of
	its power to determine policy.&quot; (<em>Works</em>, vol. 33, page 257)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
What determined Lenin&#39;s bitter struggle against Stalin was not <em>his personal foibles </em>(&quot;rudeness&quot;)
<em>but the role he played in introducing the methods and ideology of alien social classes
and strata into the very Party leadership which should have been a bulwark against those
things. </em>In the last months of his life, weakened by illness, Lenin turned more and
more frequently to Trotsky, for support in his struggle against the bureaucracy and its
creature, Stalin. On the question of the monopoly of foreign trade, on the question of
Georgia, and finally, in the struggle to oust Stalin from the leadership, Lenin formed a
bloc <em>with Trotsky, the only man in the leadership he could trust.</em>
</p>

<p>
Throughout this entire last period of his life, in numerous articles, speeches, and
above all letters, Lenin repeatedly expressed his solidarity with Trotsky. On all the
important issues we have mentioned, it was Trotsky whom he singled out to defend his point
of view in the leading bodies of the party. Lenin&#39;s appraisal of Trotsky in the Suppressed
Testament can only be understood in the light of these facts. Needless to say, all the
evidence for the existence of this bloc between Lenin and Trotsky against the Stalin
clique was kept under lock and key, for many years. But truth will out. The letters to
Trotsky published in Volume 54, of the latest Russian edition of Lenin&#39;s <em>Collected
Works</em>, although even now not complete, are irrefutable proof of the bloc that
existed between Lenin and Trotsky.

</p>

<p>
Those very letters, along with other material were long ago published by Trotsky in the
West - as early as 1928 in <em>The Real Situation in Russia. </em>Even now the bureaucracy
dare not publish all the material in their possession. To stall the growing suspicions of
the Communist Party rank-and-file abroad they utilise the services of the Monty Johnstones
to sneer at the writings of Lenin published &quot;on Trotsky&#39;s authority&quot;. They will
have need of such friends, precisely because their own &quot;authority&quot; is rapidly
disappearing in the eyes of honest Communist Party militants everywhere.
</p>

<h4>Trotsky and the Struggle Against Bureaucracy</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>

	&quot;In 1923, as he [Lenin] lay incapacitated on his deathbed&#8230;this question was
	discussed in the Party leadership which, with Trotsky&#39;s participation, drew up a
	resolution - unanimously adopted on 5th December, 1923 - spotlighting the
	bureaucratisation of the Party apparatus and the danger arising from it of the detachment
	of the masses from the Party, and calling for the development of freedom for open party
	debate and discussion.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>, page 22)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Comrade Johnstone poses the question as though the Party leadership unanimously took up
Lenin&#39;s position on the question of bureaucracy - in which case it is hard to see what the
difference was between Trotsky and Stalin-Zinoviev-Kamenev, the leading
&quot;triumvirate&quot;. Alas! One resolution does not make a struggle against
bureaucracy. Stalin, in his day, also frequently denounced the &quot;evils of
bureaucracy&quot;. Khruschev, Kosygin and others have sponsored not a few resolutions on
this subject. For a Marxist, however, a resolution is a guide to action; but for a cynical
bureaucrat, there is nothing better than a &quot;unanimous&quot;,

&quot;anti-bureaucratic&quot; proclamation to throw dust in the eyes of the masses.
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone&#39;s appeal to this resolution sounds all the more hollow in the light of
what subsequently happened. Exactly how the transition was made from &quot;unanimous,
anti-bureaucratic&quot; resolutions to the police-terror, concentration camps and all the
other horrors of Stalinist totalitarianism, Johnstone doesn&#39;t explain.
</p>

<p>
The behaviour of the dominant Kamenev-Zinoviev-Stalin faction on the Central Committee
was a strange way of manifesting their loyalty to Lenin. Despite the protests of
Krupskaya, Lenin&#39;s &quot;testament&quot; was suppressed. Despite his clear directive,
Stalin was not removed. Lenin&#39;s advice about increasing the working class composition of
the party and its organisations was cynically used to justify the drafting into the party
of large numbers of inexperienced and politically backward elements, who were putty in the
hands of the apparatus-men, hand-picked by Stalin&#39;s machine.

</p>

<p>
Simultaneously, a campaign of calumny and falsification was opened up against Trotsky.
It was at this time that all the old smears about Trotsky&#39;s non-Bolshevik past (which
Lenin had written off in his &quot;testament&quot;), about the &quot;permanent
revolution&quot;, Brest-Litovsk, and the rest, were dragged up by the ruling clique to
discredit Trotsky and oust him from the leadership. Zinoviev, when he subsequently broke
with Stalin and went over to the Opposition, later admitted that the myth of
&quot;Trotskyism&quot; was deliberately invented at this time.
</p>

<p>
Kamenev, Zinoviev and Stalin were not, at this stage, consciously aware of the
processes which were taking place in the Soviet state and which they were unwittingly
abetting. They did not realise in what direction their attacks on Trotsky and
&quot;Trotskyism&quot; would lead them. But in attempting to drive a wedge between

&quot;Trotskyisim&quot; and Leninism, they set in motion all the machinery of historical
falsification and bureaucratic harassment which marked the first decisive step away from
the ideas and traditions of October towards the monstrous bureaucratic police state of
Stalin and Brezhnev.
</p>

<p>
Referring to Trotsky&#39;s criticism of bureaucracy in <em>The New Course</em>, Monty
Johnstone states:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Although its overall approach is rather negative, there is much that can be seen
	to have been right in its attacks on the growth and power of the Party apparatus under
	Stalin&#39;s control especially of what we now know of the gross abuses, violating the very
	essence of Socialist democracy and legality in which this was to result&#8230;<em>The New
	Course</em>&#8230;contains trenchant Marxist criticisms of the methods of Stalinist
	bureaucracy&#8230;&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>, page 22)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
The reader will not fail to note, this new and startling &quot;concession&quot; of
Comrade Johnstone&#39;s. With all the wisdom of hindsight, and with a truly schoolmasterly
air, Monty Johnstone gives Trotsky&#39;s analysis of Stalinist bureaucracy a neat tick - with
marks deducted for a &quot;rather negative&quot; overall approach. In the meantime,
concealed behind the nebulous formula &quot;violation of Socialist democracy&quot; lie
thirty years of bloody reaction against October; the extermination of the entire Old
Bolshevik leadership; the liquidation of entire Soviet peoples; the destruction of
millions in slave-labour camps, and the destruction of revolutions abroad. These minor
&quot;episodes&quot; find no place in Monty Johnstone&#39;s &quot;balanced&quot; analysis. No,
far better to write them of as &quot;mistakes&quot; of the past, which still &quot;await
analysis&quot;. Monty Johnstone, who shows himself to be such a diligent researcher into
the minutiae of the archives of Bolshevism, modestly declines the task of analysing and
explaining the bloody crimes of Stalinism over the past three or four decades.

</p>

<p>
Marxism, is first and foremost, a method of historical analysis, which provides the
advanced guard of the working class with the perspectives which are the essential
pre-requisites of a successful struggle for power. Marxists do not stumble about blindly
in the wake of the historical process, mumbling about &quot;mistakes&quot; and
&quot;accidents&quot; or weeping crocodile tears over &quot;tragedies&quot;. The task of
a, Marxist is to analyse and understand <em>in advance </em>the general tendencies and
processes in society. Of course, such an analysis cannot provide a blueprint, accurately
predicting every little detail. That is unnecessary. It is sufficient to have understood
the general process, in order not to be taken by surprise by history.
</p>

<p>
Trotsky explained the development of Stalinism <em>in advance </em>as the
expression of a petty-bourgeois reaction against October. He explained, as Lenin had done,
the tremendous threat of internal degeneration of the Party in which the bureaucracy -
that caste of upstart officials who had done well out of the revolution and saw no need to
disturb their comfortable office routine by continuing the revolutionary struggles - would
act as the transmission belt diffusing the moods of petty-bourgeois reaction and despair
into the party.

</p>



<p>
<em>The New Course </em>is described by-Comrade Johnstone as a work containing
&quot;trenchant Marxist criticisms&quot; of bureaucracy. The reader may be excused if he
feels somewhat perplexed. We know that beautiful butterflies come from ugly and twisted
chrysalises. But how did the Trotsky of the &quot;trenchant Marxist criticisms&quot;
suddenly emerge from the congenital ultra-left, revolutionary phrasemonger and
petty-bourgeois individualist of the previous twenty-one pages? Was it an accident,
Comrade Johnstone, that Trotsky and the Left Opposition alone, after Lenin&#39;s death could
produce such &quot;trenchant Marxist criticism&quot; of the Stalinist bureaucracy? Where
was the criticism of the Pollitts and Dutts, the Khruschevs and Kosygins at that time? Is
it a fundamental tenet of the Marxist-Leninist outlook that &quot;trenchant Marxist
criticism&quot; always comes only <em>after </em>the event?

</p>

<p>
Even here, Monty Johnstone distorts Trotsky&#39;s position by describing it as a criticism
of the <em>methods </em>of Stalinist bureaucracy. That was not at all the position of
Trotsky. That is precisely the type of &quot;anti-bureaucratism&quot; of Stalin, Kosygin,
Brezhnev, Gollan. In <em>The New Course</em>, Trotsky does not deal with <em>mannerisms</em>,
but <em>social classes and strata. </em>The leaders of the bureaucracy have
always been prepared to rail against &quot;bureaucratic methods&quot;, &quot;red
tape&quot;, etc. But such an approach as Trotsky explains, has nothing in common with
Marxism:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;It is unworthy of a Marxist to consider that bureaucratism is only the aggregate
	of the bad habits of office holders. Bureaucratism is a social phenomenon in that it is a
	definite system of administration of men and things. Its profound causes lie in the
	heterogeneity of society, the difference between the daily and the fundamental interests
	of various groups of the population.&quot; (<em>The New Course</em>, page 41)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Far from the idea of bureaucracy as a &quot;state of mind&quot; or merely a remnant of
capitalism which automatically &quot;withers away&quot; with the approach of the higher
order of socialism, Trotsky warned that the emergence of a privileged stratum of officials
was inevitable under the prevailing conditions of economic and cultural backwardness in
Russia, would create enormous dangers for the revolution itself. Under certain conditions
(a split in the party, the combination of the peasantry, petty capitalists and a section
of the bureaucracy on a restorationist platform) an actual counter-revolution was
possible, as Lenin had repeatedly warned.

</p>

<p>
Trotsky pointed to the example of the degeneration of the German Social Democracy,
which prior to 1914 was regarded as the leading body of the world Marxist movement. This
degeneration was explained by Lenin end Trotsky, not by the personal failings or betrayal
of individual leaders (although these, too, played a fatal role), <em>but first and
foremost by the objective conditions in which the German party had functioned before the
War</em>; the absence of great social upheavals and revolutionary struggles, the stagnant
parliamentary milieu which created &quot;a generation of bureaucrats, of philistines, of
dullards whose political physiognomy was completely revealed in the first hours of the
imperialist war.&quot;
</p>

<p>
In the years following the Civil War, there crystallised a new social stratum of Soviet
officials, in part drawn from the old Tsarist bureaucracy, in part from the bourgeois
specialists and also from former workers and Communists who had been absorbed into the
machinery of state and party and had lost touch with the masses. It was this stratum of
conservative bureaucrats, self-satisfied and narrow-minded jacks-in-office, from which
Stalin&#39;s faction in the Party derived its support. These were the elements who, after 1921
shouted loudest against the &quot;Permanent Revolution&quot; and &quot;Trotskyism&quot;.
By that they understood not Trotsky&#39;s writings of 1905, not the obscure polemics of the
past, but <em>the storm and stress of October and the Civil War. </em>The bureaucrat wishes
nothing better than peace and quiet to get on with his orderly job of organising those

&quot;beneath&quot; him. The slogans advanced by Stalin-Bukharin clique &quot;socialism at
a snail&#39;s pace&quot; and &quot;socialism in one country&quot; were precisely what the
bureaucracy wanted to hear.
</p>

<p>
The years of revolution and Civil War had exhausted the masses and partly undermined
their morale. The defeat of a series of revolutions internationally weakened the appeal of
the Bolshevik ideas among the more backward and petty-bourgeois strata. From the outset,
the Bolshevik-Leninist minority, led by Trotsky, was fighting against the stream. On the
other hand, the upstart bureaucracy became more arrogant with every step backwards which
was forced upon the revolution in Russia and internationally. Leaning upon the most
backward classes and strata of society, the Kulaks, the NEP speculators and small
capitalists, the Stalin-Bukharin clique struck blows against the very basis of the October
Revolution. Apart from the fostering of capitalist elements inside Russia, the right-wing
policies of the leadership led to a series of fresh reversals on an international scale,
culminating in the horrific slaughter of the Chinese Revolution in 1927.
</p>

<p>
It is not possible here to go into the international events of this period. Suffice it
to remark that in China, in the period of 1925-7, the Stalin-Bukharin clique carried out
the dissolution of the Chinese Communist Party into the Kuomintang. Chiang Kai-Shek, the
butcher of the Chinese workers, was hailed as the great leader of the Chinese Revolution.
The Kuomintang was enrolled as sympathetic section of the Communist International - with
only one vote of the leadership cast against - that of Leon Trotsky. Throughout this
period, Trotsky and the Left Opposition struggled against the disastrous policies of the
Stalinists: for workers&#39; democracy, five-year plans and collectivisation by example;
against unprincipled deals with foreign &quot;democrats&quot; of the Chiang Kai-Shek camp;
for continued support for the revolutionary movements of the working class internationally
as the only real guarantee for the future of the Soviet state. Of all this, Monty
Johnstone has nothing to say, beyond the assertion that Stalin&#39;s slanderous attacks on
Trotsky &quot;rang a bell&quot; with the workers, and that the Left Opposition was
defeated by 724,000 votes to 4,000 &quot;after a nation-wide Party discussion&quot;.

</p>

<p>
The &quot;nation-wide Party discussion&quot; to which Comrade Johnstone refers
consisted of such friendly means of persuasion as the sacking of Opposition workers from
their jobs, the breaking-up of meetings by Stalinist hooligans, a vicious campaign of lies
and slander in the official press, the persecution of Trotsky&#39;s friends and supporters
which led to the deaths of numbers of prominent Bolsheviks such as Glazman (driven to
suicide by blackmail) and Joffe, the famous Soviet diplomat (denied access to necessary
medical treatment, committed suicide).
</p>

<p>
At Party meetings, Oppositionist speakers were subject to the systematic hooliganism of
gangs of quasi-fascist thugs organised by the Stalinist apparatus to intimidate the
opposition. The French Communist paper, <em>Contre le Courant </em>in the twenties reported
the methods whereby the Stalinists conducted their &quot;nation-wide Party
discussion&quot;:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>

	&quot;The bureaucrats of the Russian party have formed all over the country gangs of
	whistlers. Every time a party worker belonging to the Opposition is to take the floor,
	they post around the hall a veritable framework of men armed with police-whistles. With
	the first words of the Opposition speaker, the whistles begin. The charivari last until
	the Opposition speaker yields the floor to another.&quot; (<em>The Real Situation in Russia</em>,
	page 14 footnote)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Johnstone does not find it necessary to look too closely into the conditions under
which the final &quot;debate&quot; took place at the 1927 Party Congress, when Stalin&#39;s
henchmen, who packed the audience, made it impossible for the Opposition to make
themselves heard. Contrast this crude gangsterism with the methods adopted by Lenin in
relation to political opponents and you see to what an extent, by 1921, Stalinist reaction
had stamped out the last vestiges of the traditions of Bolshevism.
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone trots through the history of the Left Opposition with the assured air
of a tired old history master rattling off dates and &quot;facts&quot;. His composure is
not even ruffled by the last &quot;detail&quot; which he just mentions &quot;in
passing&quot;:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;From his successive places of exile - Turkey, Norway, France, and finally Mexico
	where he was murdered in 1940 - Trotsky wrote many books, pamphlets and articles and
	continued to try to build up a left opposition to Stalin.&quot;
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
But hold on, Mr. Schoolmaster, how does the calm, comradely &quot;nation-wide
discussion&quot; lead to the exile and murder of the leader of the minority? Trotsky&#39;s
murder, and that of hundreds of thousands of Oppositionists in Russia does that seem like
a product of the rational &quot;debate&quot; and political argument you portray? Around
this question, the schoolmaster shuffles warily:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;The evidence,&quot; writes Johnstone in a typically &quot;balanced&quot;
	footnote, &quot;points strongly to the assassin, Mercader or &quot;Jacson&quot;, who posed
	as a disillusioned follower of Trotsky, having in fact acted on behalf of Stalin and the
	GPU. After completing his 20-year jail sentence he left Mexico on a Czechoslovak plane [!]
	for an undisclosed [!] destination.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>, page 94)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Yet another gratuitous &quot;concession&quot; from Comrade Johnstone! Everyone these
days is well aware of the bloody record of Stalin&#39;s GPU. Every Communist Party member
knows full well that these hired killers were responsible for the murder of Trotsky and
countless other revolutionaries in Russia, Spain and elsewhere. Comrade Johnstone
magnanimously admits what he cannot deny: and <em>only </em>what he cannot deny! But merely
to &quot;admit&quot; a crime is not enough. From a Marxist one expects an explanation.
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone tries to paint a picture of the differences between Stalinism and
Trotskyism as <br />
&quot;political ones&quot;, &quot;debates&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot; etc. But the
Russian bureaucracy prefers to argue in the eloquent language of bullets, concentration
camps, or, in the case of Czechoslovakia and Hungary, tanks, planes and rockets. Lenin

&quot;murdered&quot; his opponents in polemics, but not in cold blood. Yet Monty
Johnstone, with all the innocence of a new-born babe, pretends that this is all a
&quot;mistake&quot;. Trotsky&#39;s murderer is flown away in a Czech plane &quot;to an unknown
destination&quot;. The bureaucracy do not forget their old friends, it seems, even after
the Twentieth Congress.
