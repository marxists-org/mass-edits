   <h4>Chapter 8</h4>
   <h3>Socialism in One Country</h3>

<p>
The title of the chapter &quot;The debate on Socialism in one Country&quot; warns the
reader in advance what approach Monty Johnstone will take to this question. He commences
with a grave warning:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;The great historical controversy on the possibility of building socialism in
	Russia is still today befogged on both sides by decades-old distortion and
	misrepresentation. Thus, on the one hand Trotskyists present Stalin as having from 1924,
	when he first formulated his theory, counterposed Socialism in One Country to the spread
	of revolution to other countries On the other side Soviet histories skill present
	Trotsky&#39;s opposition to Stalin&#39;s theory as opposition to Socialist Industrialisation in
	the Soviet Union and in favour of an export of revolution by force of arms. Both versions
	are equally false.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>, page 74)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Having set up and effortlessly disposed of two straw men, Monty Johnstone can take up
his customary cosy position &quot;midway between two extremes&quot;. (Such a comfortable
&quot;objectivity&quot; is supposed to be the essence of the Marxist method!) Monty
Johnstone now continues his lecture:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Stalin&#39;s argument was that the spread of revolution to the West was obviously the
	most desirable thing, but with the delay in this Russia had no alternative but to set
	itself the aim of building Socialism in the belief that she had all that was necessary to
	complete this.&quot; (<em>ibid</em>)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Adding a few appropriate quotes from Stalin, Johnstone then triumphantly concludes:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;The course of revolutions in the world, which today see a growing Socialist camp
	challenging the old imperialist one, has in no small measure confirmed Stalin&#39;s broad
	perspective.&quot; (<em>ibid</em>)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>

How did Stalin come to work out his &quot;broad perspective&quot; which history so
triumphantly vindicated? In February 1924, in his <em>Foundations of Leninism</em>, Stalin
summed up Lenin&#39;s views on the building of socialism in these words:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;The overthrow of the power of the bourgeoisie and the establishment of a
	proletarian government in one country does not yet guarantee the complete victory of
	socialism. The main task of socialism - <em>the organisation of socialist production - </em>remains
	ahead. Can this task be accomplished, can the final victory of socialism in one country be
	attained, without the joint efforts of the proletariat of several advanced countries? <em>No,
	this is impossible</em>. To overthrow the bourgeoisie the efforts of one country are
	sufficient - the history of our revolution bears this out. For the final victory of
	Socialism, <em>for the organisation of socialist production, the efforts of one country,
	particularly of such a peasant country as Russia, are insufficient. </em>For this the
	efforts of the proletarians of several advanced countries are necessary.
	</p>


	<p>
	&quot;Such, on the whole, are <em>the characteristic features of the Leninist theory of
	the proletarian revolution</em>.&quot;
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
That these were precisely the &quot;characteristic features of the Leninist theory of
proletarian revolution&quot; was nowhere in dispute up to the first part of 1924. They had
been repeated time and time again in <em>hundreds </em>of speeches, articles and documents
by Lenin since 1905. We have already quoted sufficient examples; they can be multiplied at
will. Yet before the end of 1924, Stalin&#39;s book had been revised, and the <em>exact
opposite </em>put in its place. By November 1926, Stalin could assert without even
blushing:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;The party always took as its starting point the idea that the victory of
	socialism in that country, and that task can be accomplished with the forces of a single
	country.&quot;
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Lost in admiration for Stalin&#39;s &quot;broad perspectives&quot; which history has
&quot;on the whole&quot; confirmed, Monty Johnstone can see only perversity and

&quot;underestimation of the internal forces of Russian socialism&quot; in Trotsky&#39;s
opposition to the &quot;theory&quot; of socialism in one country. This &quot;dogmatic
shibboleth&quot; of Trotsky&#39;s, Monty Johnstone explains:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Sprang from his theory of &#39;permanent revolution&#39; that we have discussed above.
	[!] It was in fact basically an expression of his disbelief in the ability of the Soviet
	Union even to survive as a workers&#39; state if the revolution did not spread to more
	advanced countries.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>, page 26)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Trotsky in 1906 had written that &quot;without the direct state support of the European
proletariat the working class of Russia cannot convert its temporary domination into a
lasting socialist dictatorship. Of this there cannot be any doubt&#8230;Left to its own
resources the working class of Russia will inevitably be crushed by the counter-revolution
the moment the peasantry turns its back on it.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Did this prognosis flow from the theory of permanent revolution alone? Lenin, who, as
we have shown, did not at that time have the same position as Trotsky, wrote in 1905:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;The proletariat is already struggling to preserve the democratic conquests for
	the sake of the socialist revolution. This struggle would be almost hopeless for the
	Russian proletariat alone, and its defeat would be inevitable&#8230;if the European
	socialist proletariat did not come to the help of the Russian proletariat&#8230;At that
	stage the liberal bourgeoisie and the well-to-do (plus a part of the middle peasantry)
	will organise a counter revolution. The Russian proletariat plus the European proletariat
	will organise the revolution. In these circumstances the Russian proletariat may win a
	second victory. The cause is then not lost. The second victory will be the socialist
	revolution in Europe. The European workers will show us &#39;how it is done&#39;.&quot;

	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Lenin&#39;s position which did not at all &quot;spring from the theory of permanent
revolution&quot; is quite clear. But let us cite one other authority which can shed
further light on this question. At a conference held in May 1905, the following position
was approved:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Only in one event would social-democracy on its own initiative direct its
	exertions towards acquiring power and holding it for as long as possible - namely in the
	event of revolution spreading to the advanced countries of Western Europe, where
	conditions for the realisation of socialism have already reached a certain ripeness. In
	this event the restricted historical limits of the Russian revolution can be considerably
	widened, and the possibility will occur of advancing on the path of socialist
	transformation.&quot;
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
The conference mentioned was that of the Russian Mensheviks, the tendency that stood
furthest of all from the theory of permanent revolution!
</p>

<p>
Thus the reader can see, irrespective of differences on other questions, <em>every
single one of the tendencies of Russian Marxism agreed on one thing</em>:<em> the
impossibility of effecting a socialist transformation in Russia without a socialist
revolution in the West. </em>On this question, Lenin was more emphatic than Trotsky.
Whereas Trotsky in 1905 foresaw the prospect of the dictatorship of the proletariat in
Russia before the workers&#39; revolution in the West, Lenin based his perspective on the
socialist revolution in Russia <em>following </em>the revolution in Western Europe.
</p>

<p>

Monty Johnstone wants to have it all ways. First he spends one half of his work
&quot;proving&quot; Lenin&#39;s implacable hostility to the theory of permanent revolution,
then he spends the other half &quot;proving&quot; that the position which <em>all </em>the
tendencies of Russian Marxism accepted without question &quot;sprang from the theory of
permanent revolution&quot;! In reality, the attitude of Trotsky, the Bolsheviks and the
Mensheviks towards the impossibility of building socialism in Russia alone (no-one even
dared to raise the question until 1924) flowed, not from the theory of the permanent
revolution alone, but <em>from the fundamental ideas of Marxism itself.</em>
</p>

<p>
Marx and Engels explained that the most fundamental factor of capitalist development
was the ever-increasing concentration of the means of production, which outstrips the
narrow confines of capitalism; on the one hand the private ownership of the means of
production, on the other, the national boundaries were transformed from progressive
features, encouraging economic growth, to reactionary fetters on the productive forces.
Today, those processes, already worked out theoretically in the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>,
have become the dominant factor of modern life. On the other hand, capitalism has united
the entire globe into a single, interconnected. interdependent whole. The bankruptcy of

&quot;national capitalism&quot; is strikingly revealed by the situation where one US
company, General Motors, has at its disposal capital in excess of the state budget of
Belgium, where the capitalist classes of Western Europe have been forced to cling together
in a Common Market, in a desperate effort to survive. Thus, even the bourgeoisie, however
inadequately, tries to overcome the limitations of the national market.
</p>

<p>
Two catastrophic World Wars should have hammered into the thickest skulls the
inescapable fact of the conflict between the existence of outmoded national states and the
development of the productive forces of the planet, which demands the fullest and freest
use of the resources of all countries. The development of gigantic, international
corporations, which straddle the Continents, present the workers of different countries
with a common enemy. Now, more than ever, does the internationalism of the <em>Communist
Manifesto </em>hold good as the <em>only </em>way forward for mankind and the <em>only </em>programme
for a genuinely socialist movement. <em>Socialist internationalism is not based on
utopianism or sentimentality but upon the development of capitalist production on a world
scale.</em>
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone tries to portray the struggle of the Left Opposition against the
Stalinist platform of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; as a scholastic debate, of no
practical importance. To add a note of solemn authority to this assertion, Johnstone has
recourse to a classical piece of Deutscherism: the &quot;debate&quot; on &quot;Socialism
in One Country&quot; was like a &quot;dispute about whether it would be possible to cover
with a roof a building in which both sides were in favour of starting work, being already
in agreement on its shape and the materials to be used.&quot;

</p>

<p>
It would be hard, even among the heap of theoretical crudities and half-truths which
Deutscher provides in abundance, to find a more ignorant characterisation. The differences
between the Left Opposition and the Stalinist bureaucracy were not at all about the need
to develop the economy of the Soviet Union on socialist lines. In fact, insofar as that
question was raised, it was the Opposition that fought for a programme of planning and
industrialisation, and the advocates of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; who rejected
it, up until 1929, preferring to lean for support on the kulaks and &quot;Nepmen&quot;. It
was the Opposition which was implacable in its support for the internationalist
perspectives of Bolshevism, which also stood firmly in favour of socialist construction in
Russia. And this was no accident.
</p>

<p>
The conflicts which arose in Russia at this time, bore not the slightest resemblance to
academic &quot;debates&quot;, but were concerned with the vital issues affecting the life
and welfare of the Russian working class, the future of the Russian and international
revolution. We have already outlined the processes which were taking place in Russia at
the time. We have shown that the idea of &quot;Socialism in Russia alone&quot; expressed
the mood of reaction and cynicism of that social stratum which had done well out of the
revolution, and which now wished to apply the brakes to the process set in motion in
October, to re-establish &quot;equilibrium&quot;. The struggle of the Left Opposition
against this &quot;theory&quot; was part and parcel of the struggle of Bolshevism-Leninism
for survival in the teeth of petty-bourgeois and bureaucratic reaction against October.

</p>

<p>
The Stalinist bureaucracy had its roots in the economic and cultural backwardness which
the revolution inherited from Tsarism. It drew nourishment from every defeat of the
international proletariat, whose victory alone could provide the Soviet state with the
resources to overcome the chronic problems of backwardness and carry through the complete
transformation of society on socialist lines. The bureaucracy leaned upon the most
backward, anti-socialist elements within Russia (the rich peasants and NEP speculators) to
strike blows against the proletariat and its vanguard - the Left Opposition. On the other
hand, lacking any faith in the abilities of the workers of the West to carry out a
revolution, it acted as a brake on the development of the young, immature parties of the
Communist International.
</p>

<p>
The spirit of revolutionary optimism with which the writings of Lenin and Trotsky are
saturated was a reflection of their implicit faith in the ability of the working class to
change society. The creation of the Third (Communist) International, after the seizure of
power in Russia, was the supreme expression of the Bolshevik conception of the revolution,
not as a national phenomenon, valid within the borders of the former Tsarist Empire alone,
<em>but as an international event. </em>From the very outset, Lenin and the
Bolsheviks saw October as <em>the start of the world revolution. </em>Without that
perspective, the socialist revolution in Russia would have been an adventure, as the
Mensheviks accused it of being. In November 1918, Lenin answered. these critics thus:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;The facts of history have proved to those Russian patriots who will hear of
	nothing but the immediate interests of their country conceived in the old style, that the
	transformation of our Russian revolution into a socialist revolution, was not an adventure
	but a necessity since <em>there was no other choice</em>; Anglo-French and American
	imperialism. will <em>inevitably </em>strangle the independence and freedom of Russia <em>unless
	</em>the world-wide socialist revolution, world-wide Bolshevism, triumphs.&quot;

	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Trotsky in the opinion of Monty Johnstone &quot;over-estimated&quot; the prospects for
international socialist revolution and &quot;under-estimated&quot; the possibilities of
building socialism in Russia alone. The wisdom of the Deutschers and the Johnstones,
essentially the same as the &quot;realism&quot; of reformist politicians, consists in a
slavish worship of the established fact: &quot;Lenin and Trotsky predicted a world
revolution. That did not happen. Lenin and Trotsky said that without a world revolution,
Socialism could not be built in Russia. But that is what happened. <em>Ergo</em>, Bolshevism
is a mere fanciful utopia, and Stalinism is justified.&quot; Such is the

&quot;philosophy&quot; of Deutscherism, shorn of its stylistic niceties. Monty Johnstone
adds nothing to the profundities of his mentor, but merely deletes Lenin&#39;s name from the
syllogism.
</p>

<p>
The wisdom of the seminar-room stops short of the fundamental question: <em>why</em> was
there &quot;no revolution&quot; in Europe? More correctly: why did the series of
revolutionary movements in Europe in 1918-1923 not result in the seizure of power by the
working class? From Monty Johnstone and Deutscher, we get the &quot;facts&quot;: the
revolution failed. But precisely for a Marxist the matter cannot end there. If we are
interested, not in striking erudite poses, but in actually changing society, we must
understand the lessons of history, especially the lessons of great revolutionary
movements. That was always the method of Bolshevism, the method of Lenin and Trotsky; for
he who fails to learn from past mistakes, is surely doomed to repeat them.
</p>




<p>
<em>The Revolutionary movement which swept through Europe in </em>1918-20 <em>was defeated by
the treachery of the Social-Democratic leadership. </em>Those same traitors who had sold
out in 1914, who were directly responsible for the slaughter of millions of workers in
uniform in the war, now recoiled in holy horror from the prospect of &quot;bloody civil
war&quot;. In one country after another: in Germany, Austria, Britain, France, Italy, the
masses moved in a revolutionary direction, only to be headed off by the cowardice and
ineptitude of their &quot;leaders&quot;. Thus, in 1918 in Germany, where a revolution had
placed power <em>peacefully </em>in the hands of the workers, the Social Democratic
leadership &quot;voluntarily surrendered&quot; it to the bourgeoisie. Their rottenness <em>alone
</em>prevented the German workers from realising the fruits of their victory, and coming to
the assistance of the beleaguered Soviet Republic.

</p>

<p>
When Lenin and Trotsky explained that, without the socialist revolution in the West,
the Russian workers&#39; state would inevitably be crushed by reaction or by an imperialist
war, this was not, as Johnstone asserts, a manifestation of &quot;defeatism&quot;, but one
of extreme revolutionary realism. Marxism itself is a materialist (and therefore
profoundly realistic) philosophy, impregnated through and through with a spirit of
revolutionary optimism. It is incompatible with the sort of smug, &quot;realistic&quot;
philistinism which is the heart and soul of all brands of reformism.
</p>

<p>
Lenin and Trotsky were always honest and realistic in their appraisal of the prospects
of the revolution in Russia and internationally. They understood that the only real
guarantee for the future of the Soviet Republic lay in the socialist revolution in the
West. They did not lull the working class with sugary illusions about &quot;peaceful
co-existence&quot; but mercilessly hammered home the fact that <em>without a socialist
transformation on a world scale, new imperialist world wars - a second, a third, a tenth
world war - would be inevitable.</em>

</p>

<p>
The optimism of Lenin and Trotsky on the prospects for the international socialist
revolution was fully justified by the magnificent movements of the workers after the First
World War. <em>But neither Lenin, Trotsky, nor anyone else can guarantee the success of a
revolutionary movement. </em>That depends on a number of factors: the impasse of the
capitalist system, the crisis of government, the movement of the working masses, and the
disaffection of the middle layers of society. But one of the most decisive factors is the
presence of a leadership of the working class worthy of the name. The absence of such a
leadership in Western Europe led the workers&#39; movement to one defeat after another, in the
next period paving the way for the victory of fascist reaction and a new and more terrible
World War. <em>Twenty-seven million Russian dead and the destruction of the bulk of
industry built up painfully by the heroic sacrifices of the Soviet porkers was a harsh
confirmation of the realistic prognoses of Lenin and Trotsky.</em>
</p>

<p>
It is not possible here to go in detail into the international policies of Stalinism.
That will be dealt with in a future work. Suffice it to note that the policy of
&quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; led to the gradual transformation of Soviet foreign
policy from a revolutionary strategy, basing itself upon the working classes of all
countries, and attempting, through the Third International, to build up viable Communist
Parties as revolutionary leaderships in various countries, to one of manoeuvres and
&quot;deals&quot; with bourgeois governments, trade union bureaucrats and colonial

&quot;democrats&quot; of the type of Chiang Kai-Shek.
</p>

<p>
Cause and effect do not stand at eternally fixed antipodes but often change places, the
one passing into the other. The rise of the Soviet bureaucracy had as its premise the
isolation of the revolution in a backward country. The terrible defeats of the working
class in Germany and Bulgaria in 1923, in Britain in 1926, and above all in China in 1927,
which followed from the disastrous policies of the Stalin-Bukharin leadership in turn
reinforced the position of the bureaucracy and the advocates of &quot;Socialism in One
Country&quot;, and doomed the Bolshevik-Leninist opposition to defeat. The expulsion of
the Left Opposition in 1927 paved the way for a new and more reactionary turn in Russia in
the period of Stalinist consolidation. The fate of the Revolution in Russia and
internationally, far from being mechanically separated &quot;stages&quot;, with the
international revolution as a desirable, but not altogether necessary addition (the roof
of a house, the fairy on the Christmas tree) were inextricably bound together and mutually
conditioned by each other.
</p>

<h4>Trotsky and the Five Year Plans</h4>
<p>
Monty Johnstone, by a most peculiar piece of mental gymnastics, attributes to Trotsky a
&quot;defeatist&quot; attitude in relation to socialist planning in the Soviet Union.
Wherein lay Trotsky&#39;s alleged &quot;defeatism&quot;?

</p>

<p>
As we have seen, Trotsky and the Left Opposition had struggled for a whole period
(1923-27) for the idea of the development of industry through the agency of Five Year
Plans, in the teeth of opposition and ridicule from the Stalinists. Following the
expulsion of the Left Opposition (1927), the Stalin faction opened up a struggle against
the &quot;Right deviation&quot; of Bukharin and, in order to strike a blow against this
group, took over, in a caricatured form, certain aspects of the programme of the Left
Opposition.
</p>

<p>
While ignoring the sections referring to the need for workers&#39; democracy, the
Stalinists appropriated the idea of industrialisation and Five Year Plans. The danger of
capitalist restoration, which the Left Opposition had warned against, and which the
Stalinists repeatedly denied in the previous period, was now used by the Stalin faction as
a stick to beat their erstwhile Bukharinite supporters.
</p>

<p>
In dealing with this manoeuvre of the Stalinists, Monty Johnstone writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>

	&quot;It is one of the myths of vulgar Trotskyism that the implementation by Stalin
	after 1928 of more far-reaching plans [?] than had been put forward by the Opposition in
	itself proves that the latter was correct. As Maurice Dobb writes: &quot;It does not
	follow that what may have been practicable in 1928-9 was necessarily practicable at an
	earlier date when both industry and agriculture were weaker.&quot; However, I would accept
	the argument that, if the Party had heeded earlier the Opposition&#39;s warnings against the
	dangerous growth in the power of the Kulaks [rich peasants] in the countryside, the
	process of collectivisation in 1929-30 could have been less violent [!] As against this,
	though the Trotskyists&#39; economic policies favouring the exploitation of the countryside by
	the town [!] through a system of price differentials which would keep up the price of
	industrial products at the expense of agricultural prices (see e.g. <em>The New Economics</em>
	by Preobrazhensky, the Opposition&#39;s chief economist) anticipated theoretically much of the
	approach to the peasantry that from 1929 Stalin was to apply in practice. [!]&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>,
	page 25 footnote)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Of Stalin&#39;s &quot;more far-reaching plans&quot;, we will say more later. But first, let
us deal with the &quot;Red Professor&quot;, Maurice Dobb. Is it true to say that it was
easier to begin the policy of industrialisation and Five Year Plans in 1928- 9 than in the
earlier period? Monty Johnstone answers this piece of nonsense himself when he refers to
the Opposition&#39;s warnings against the Kulak danger.
</p>

<p>
As against the Stalin-Bukharin policy of concession to the Kulaks and speculators
(&quot;Nepmen&quot;) at the expense of the poor peasants and industrial workers, the
Opposition advocated the <em>taxing of the rich peasants</em>, in order to provide the
necessary investment for industrialisation; on the basis of industrialisation alone, the
villages could be provided with the means of overcoming the age-old backwardness of
Russian agriculture. Only on the basis of the <em>mechanisation</em> of agriculture could <em>collectivisation

by example</em> be carried out. To describe this policy of hitting the Kulaks as
&quot;the town exploiting the countryside&quot; is merely to repeat the slanders hurled at
the Left Opposition by the Stalinists - before they went over to the maniacal policy of
collectivisation by force!
</p>

<p>
When, after the expulsion of the Left Opposition, the Stalinists were forced to turn
against the &quot;Rights&quot; - behind whom stood the gathering menace of Kulak reaction
- the situation in the countryside was already desperate, while heavy industry, the
necessary basis of socialist construction, had stagnated for a whole period. It is simply
a lie to assert that the Stalinist opposition to industrialisation in the period 1923-7
was dictated by their intentions to build up industry and agriculture. On the contrary:
their line was one of encouraging those elements in the Soviet economy which were to prove
a terrible stumbling block to the development of production in the period of the first
five-year plans.
</p>

<p>
With his customary magnanimity, Monty Johnstone concedes that if the Party had heeded
the Opposition&#39;s warnings on the Kulak danger &quot;the process of collectivisation in
1929-30 could have been less violent. And just how &quot;violent&quot; was this

&quot;process&quot; of collectivisation, Comrade Johnstone? In 1930, the total harvest of
grain amounted to 835 million hundredweight. In the next two years it fell to 200 million;
this at a time when the level of grain production was only barely sufficient to feed the
population. The result spelled famine for millions of workers and peasants. Sugar
production in the same period dropped from 109 million poods to 48 million.
</p>

<p>
Even more terrible were the losses to livestock. The insane tempo of collectivisation,
and the vicious methods used, provoked the peasantry to desperate resistance, which
plunged the countryside into a new and bloody civil war. The enraged peasants slaughtered
their horses and cattle as a protest. The number of horses fell from 34.9 million in 1929
to 15.6 million in 1934; i.e. a loss of 55%. The number of horned cattle fell from 30.7
million to 19.5 million: a loss of 40%. The number of pigs 55%, sheep 66%. <em>Soviet
agriculture to the present day has not recovered from the blow dealt by forced
collectivisation</em>. But the most gruesome statistic of all is the millions of peasants
who perished in this period - from hunger, cold, disease, in running fights with the Red
Army or in the slave-labour camps afterwards; <em>the figure of ten million exterminated
was not denied by Stalin; four million is the lowest estimate</em>. Such is the little bit
of &quot;violence&quot; to which Monty Johnstone coyly refers in his footnote.
</p>

<p>
Stalin&#39;s plan for collectivisation certainly went &quot;much further&quot; than the
proposals laid down by the Opposition! Trotsky denounced it as an adventure, given the
material backwardness of Russian agriculture. Stalin&#39;s &quot;broad perspectives&quot;

spelled disaster to Russian agriculture. But how about industry? Did not the success of
Stalin&#39;s plans which went &quot;much further&quot; than the perspectives of the Left
Opposition, prove how &quot;pessimistic&quot; Trotsky was?
</p>

<p>
When, after the notorious Moscow Frame-up Trials, Trotsky appeared voluntarily before
the Dewey Commission, which went through the charges levelled against him and the
Opposition, he answered, among other things, a number of questions relating to the
differences with the Stalinists on the question of industrialisation in 1923-9. We quote
verbatim from the text of his evidence:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Goldman: Mr. Trotsky, with reference to the industrialisation of the Soviet
	Union, what was your attitude prior to your expulsion from the Soviet Union?
	</p>


	<p>
	&quot;Trotsky: During the period from 1922 until 1929 I fought for the necessity of an
	accelerated industrialisation. I wrote in the beginning of 1925 a book in which I tried to
	prove that by planning and direction of industry it was possible to have a yearly
	coefficient of industrialisation up to twenty. I was denounced at the time as a fantastic
	man, a super-industrialiser. It was the official name for Trotskyites at that time:
	&#39;super-industrialisers&#39;.
	</p>

	<p>
	&quot;Goldman: What was the name of the book that you wrote?
	</p>

	<p>
	&quot;Trotsky: Whither Russia, Toward Capitalism or Socialism?
	</p>


	<p>
	&quot;Goldman: In English, it was published, I am quite sure under the title <em>Wither
	Russia, Toward Capitalism or Socialism?</em>
	</p>

	<p>
	&quot;Trotsky: The march of events showed that I was too cautious in my appreciation of
	the possibility of planned economy - not too courageous. It was my fight between 1922 and
	1925, and also the fight for the Five Year Plan. It begins with the year 1923, when the
	Left Opposition began to fight for the necessity of using the Five Year Plan.
	</p>

	<p>
	&quot;Goldman: And Stalin at that time called you a &#39;super-industrialist&#39;?
	</p>


	<p>
	&quot;Trotsky: Yes.
	</p>

	<p>
	&quot;Goldman: He was opposed to the rapid industrialisation of the country.
	</p>

	<p>
	&quot;Trotsky: Permit me to say that in 1927, when I was Chairman of the Commission at
	Dnieprostroy for a hydro-electric station, a power station, I insisted in the session of
	the Central Committee on the necessity of building up this station. Stalin answered, and
	it is published: &#39;For us to build up the Dnieprostroy station is the same as for a peasant
	to buy a gramophone instead of a cow.&#39;&quot; (<em>The Case of Leon Trotsky</em>, page 245)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Such was the extent of Stalin&#39;s &quot;broad perspectives&quot; in 1927! At that time,
the accusation levelled at the Opposition by the Stalinists was not that they were
&quot;pessimistic&quot; but that were &quot;super-industrialisers&quot;! What about the
assertion that the plans later implemented by Stalin went &quot;much further&quot; than
those of Trotsky?
</p>

<p>

The years 1925-27 were occupied by the struggle of the Opposition against the economic
cowardice of the Stalin-Bukharin leadership. The Stalinists in 1926 first suggested a
&quot;plan&quot; which would begin with a coefficient of nine for the first year, eight
for the second, gradually lowering to four - a declining rate of growth! Trotsky, whom the
ruling clique branded as &quot;super-industrialist&quot;, described this miserable excuse
for a plan as the &quot;sabotage of industry&quot; (not, of course, in a literal sense).
Later, the plan was revised to give a coefficient of nine for all five years. Trotsky
fought for a coefficient of 18-20. He pointed out that the rate of growth, even under
capitalism, had been six! The ruling clique paid no attention to the Opposition and went
ahead with their pusillanimous plans. Instead of the miserable nine percent projected by
the &quot;broad perspectives&quot; of Stalin-Bukharin, the results of the first year of
the five year plan completely bore out the perspective of the Opposition and exposed the
complete inadequacy of the coefficients advanced by Stalin and Co. As a result, the
following year they plunged into the disastrous adventure of a &quot;five year plan in
four years&quot;. In vain did Trotsky warn against this crazy idea, which, threw
everything completely off balance. By bureaucratic <em>ukaze</em> the leadership now decreed
a coefficient of 30-35%! The wrecking of industry in this period, which was blamed upon
the unfortunate victims of the &quot;sabotage trials&quot;, was in reality the result of
the adventurism of the Stalinists, whose pursuit of the chimera of &quot;Socialism in One
Country&quot; and &quot;Five Year Plan in Four Years&quot; led to the seizing up of the
economy and untold hardships for the Soviet working class.

</p>

<p>
In answer to all the misrepresentations and half-truths of Monty Johnstone concerning
Trotsky&#39;s attitude to the Five Year Plans, let us see what Trotsky himself had to say to
the Dewey Commission:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Trotsky: My attitude toward the economic development of the Soviet Union can be
	characterised as follows: I defend the Soviet economy against the capitalist critics and
	the Social Democratic reformist critics, and I criticize the bureaucratic methods of the
	leadership. The deductions were very simple. They were based on the Soviet press itself.
	We have a certain freedom from the bureaucratic hypnosis. It was absolutely possible to
	see all of the dangers on the basis of the Soviet press itself.
	</p>

	<p>
	&quot;Goldman: Can you give us an idea, very generally, of the successes of the
	industrialisation in the Soviet Union?
	</p>

	<p>

	&quot;Trotsky: The successes are very important, and I affirmed it every time. They are
	due to the abolition of private property and to the possibilities inherent in planned
	economy. But, they are - I cannot say exactly - but I will say two or three times less
	than they could be under a regime of Soviet democracy.
	</p>

	<p>
	&quot;Goldman: So the advances are due, in spite of the bureaucratic control and
	methods?
	</p>

	<p>
	&quot;Trotsky: They are due to the possibilities inherent in the socialisation of the
	productive forces.&quot; (<em>The Case of Leon Trotsky</em>, page 249)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
In pursuit of additional proof of Trotsky&#39;s &quot;pessimism&quot;, Johnstone quotes
from <em>The Third International After Lenin</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;To the extent that productivity of labour and the productivity of a social system
	as a whole are measured in the market by the correlation of prices, it is not so much
	military intervention as the intervention of cheaper capitalist commodities that
	constitutes perhaps the greatest immediate menace to the Soviet economy.&quot;
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
These lines were written in 1928, at a time when capitalist market forces were
re-asserting themselves in the Soviet economy under the NEP. when the Kulaks (rich
peasants) were following the advice of Bukharin: &quot;Get rich!&quot; and when the danger
of an actual capitalist restoration, which the Left Opposition warned against, was very
real. Commenting on Trotsky&#39;s words without explaining the context Johnstone writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;The monopoly of foreign trade, which Stalin and the Party majority correctly
	stressed was the means of the Soviet Union shielding itself from such economic subversion,
	became for Trotsky &#39;evidence of the severity and the dangerous character of our
	dependence.&#39;&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>, page 267)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Monty Johnstone&#39;s memory is conveniently short. For this same &quot;Stalin and the
Party Majority&quot; (i.e. Bukharin) not five years before had stood for the <em>abolition </em>of
the state monopoly of foreign trade, and actually passed a resolution in the Central
Committee on October 12, 1922 - abrogating the monopoly. The <em>Collected Edition </em>of
Lenin&#39;s works in Russian contains a whole series of letters by Lenin in which he appeals
to Trotsky to form a bloc with him for the struggle to maintain the monopoly of foreign
trade. Thus, on December 13, 1922, Lenin wrote to Trotsky:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;In any event, I would beg you to take upon yourself at the forthcoming Plenum, <em>the
	defence of our common point of view on the unconditional necessity of the preservation and
	strengthening of the monopoly of foreign trade</em>.&quot; (Lenin, <em>Collected Works</em>,
	Russian edition vol. 54, page 324)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
What did Trotsky mean by his statement that &quot;cheap foreign commodities&quot; posed
a threat to the Soviet power? In 1917, the proletarian revolution had taken place, not as
Marx and Engels had visualised, in an advanced capitalist country, but in a backward,
semi-feudal peasant economy. This happened, not because &quot;all the conditions necessary
for building socialism&quot; were present in Russia, but because of the absolute inability
of the Russian bourgeoisie to solve a single one of the historic tasks before it, on the
basis of the capitalist system. Russia was propelled towards the proletarian revolution,
not because it was the most advanced, but <em>precisely because it was the most backward of
European powers</em>. As Lenin expressed it, capitalism broke at its weakest link.
</p>

<p>
The victory of the Russian working class in the October Revolution was the prerequisite
for beginning the transformation of Russian society. <em>The historic tasks of the
bourgeois revolution in Russia could only be carried out under the dictatorship of the
proletariat</em>. That is the essential meaning of Trotsky&#39;s theory of the permanent
revolution, worked out in 1905. The nationalisation of industry, the state plan, the
monopoly of foreign trade were the means whereby the Russian working class pulled Russia
out of the slough of age-old backwardness. The historic successes of the five year plans
in the Soviet Union are, in themselves, a sufficient justification of the October
Revolution. As Trotsky wrote in <em>The Revolution Betrayed</em>:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Socialism has demonstrated its right to victory, not on the pages of <em>Capital</em>,
	but in an industrial area comprising one-sixth of the earth&#39;s surface - not in the
	language of dialectics, but in the language of steel, cement and electricity.&quot;
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
However, the question of the historical fate of the USSR cannot be exhausted by reeling
off an inventory of the success of the five year plans. Lenin, early on, posed the vital
question in the striking phrase: &quot;Who shall prevail?&quot; The Soviet Union is not a
desert island, but part of a world economic and political system, where the fate of no one
country can be isolated from that of the whole. The Soviet Union, despite its enormous
industrial successes, still has to measure its strength against that of the imperialist
powers of the West.

</p>

<p>
The capitalist system, while already showing all the symptoms of senile decay on a
world scale, started with immeasurable advantages over the Soviet Union. From the outset,
the Bolsheviks had to struggle against the prevailing low level of culture of the masses,
the lack of a skilled labour force, in a word, of the <em>low productivity of labour</em>.
This factor, and not the volume of production in absolute terms, is the real measure of
economic success and social advancement. In this decisive field, after 50 years of Soviet
power, the Soviet Union still lags far behind the USA.
</p>

<p>
Official Soviet statistics indicate that the per capita industrial production of the
USSR is only 50-60% that of the USA. With a larger working class, with twice the number of
technicians and engineers, the actual industrial output of Russia is only 65% that of the
USA. The indices of production of heavy industry are the most dramatic. Steel production
in the USSR has risen from 4.3 million tons in 1928 to 107 million tons in 1968 - only 18
million tons less than in America (not including 24 million tons imported by the USA). But
on the one hand, per capita production of steel in the USA is higher than in the USSR. On
the other hand, the harmonious development of human life and culture are not reflected
economically by the volume of steel production alone, but more accurately by the
development of consumer and high quality technical goods for the mass of the people. In
this field, which affects the living standards of the workers, the USSR still lags behind
the capitalist countries.
</p>

<p>
The hordes of speculators, spivs and black-marketeers in Moscow, who make a living by
pestering foreign tourists for Western goods and currency, which they sell at a handsome
profit to Soviet workers are a clear indication that the threat from &quot;cheap foreign
commodities&quot; even today has not disappeared. The draconian sentences (up to and
including the death penalty) introduced to combat this speculation has no effect in
stamping out a social scourge which has its roots, not in &quot;survivals of
capitalism&quot; or the perversity of human nature, but by the objective relations between
the Soviet Union and the World Economy. which no haughty bureaucratic &quot;theories&quot;

can abolish.
</p>

<p>
As Marx explained in <em>The German Ideology</em>: &quot;Where want is generalised &#39;all
the old crap will revive.&#39;&quot; The perennial shortages, high price and low quality of
consumer goods (not merely cars and technical goods, but also clothes and foodstuffs) are
a basic fact of life for the Soviet working class. That is not to say that luxury goods do
not exist. The privileged strata of bureaucrats, factory managers, army officers, etc,
possess in abundance the things which a Soviet worker would not dream of: expensive suits,
sleek cars, luxury apartments, villas in the countryside, etc. While working-class
families in Moscow and other Soviet cities live in conditions of chronic overcrowding,
many members of the upper strata own more than one country house (dacha) in addition to
their city apartments. The luxurious style of living of the bureaucracy is a constant
affront to the masses of the Soviet people. Thus, after the Second World War, when the
Soviet workers and peasants were suffering under conditions of dreadful hardship, the
visiting Field-Marshal Montgomery received from the hands of his Soviet
&quot;brother&quot; officers the gift of a Soviet Marshal&#39;s fur coat complete with medals,
diamonds, etc, costing &pound;5,000!
</p>

<p>

Under Lenin and Trotsky, the rule of &quot;Partmaximum&quot; meant that a Party member
could not receive more than an ordinary worker, even if his skills entitled him to a
higher wage. One of the conditions for the inception of a workers&#39; state as laid down by
Lenin in <em>The State and Revolution </em>was the rule that no official was to receive a
higher wage than a skilled worker. An early decree of the Revolution fixed a wage
differential between workers and specialists of <em>not</em> more than four times, and this
Lenin frankly described as a &quot;capitalist differential&quot;, to be reduced
systematically. This law applied until 1931 when it was formally abolished by Stalin.
</p>

<h4>The &quot;Revolution Betrayed&quot;</h4>

<p>
On pages 32-33, Johnstone writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Trotsky&#39;s dogmatic shibboleths of the impossibility of building socialism in one
	country led him even now to underestimate how deeply entrenched and resilient the
	socialist system was in Russia, despite the ravages wrought by Stalin&#39;s purges. Without
	the interference of a revolution in the West in the event of war, he claimed, &#39;the social
	base of the Soviet Union must be crushed, not only in the case of defeat, but also in the
	case of victory!&#39;
	</p>

	<p>
	&quot;Out of touch with Soviet reality, he wrote that &#39;the Soviet bureaucracy has gone
	far towards preparing a bourgeois restoration,&#39; and, &#39;must inevitably in future seek
	support for itself in property relations,&#39; entailing &#39;its conversion into a new possessing
	class.&#39;&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Did Trotsky really say this? Let us reproduce <em>in full</em> the passage from <em>The
Revolution Betrayed</em> from which Johnstone has carved out his latest
&quot;balanced&quot; mini-quotes. On pages 251-2 Trotsky writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;As a conscious political force the bureaucracy has betrayed the revolution. But a
	victorious revolution is fortunately not only a program and a banner, not only political
	institutions, but also a system of social relations. To betray it is not enough. You have
	to overthrow it. The October revolution has been betrayed by the ruling stratum, but not
	yet overthrown. <em>It has a great power of resistance, coinciding with the established
	proletariat, the consciousness of its best elements, the impasse of world capitalism, and
	the inevitability of world revolution</em>.&quot; (our emphasis)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
In these words of Trotsky, which Johnstone has evidently &quot;not noticed&quot;, there
is not a trace of any under-estimation of the resilience of the basic social gains of the
October Revolution, or of any fatalism about the victory of a bourgeois
counter-revolution. But let us read on. We reproduce the next section of Trotsky&#39;s work
(&quot;The Question of the Character of the Soviet Union Not Yet Decided by History&quot;)
in full, the better to illustrate how Monty Johnstone&#39;s &quot;balance&quot; method of
quoting works out in practice. Continuing the above argument, Trotsky writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;In order better to understand the character of the present Soviet Union, let us
	make two different hypotheses about its future. Let us assume first that the Soviet
	bureaucracy is overthrown by a revolutionary party having all the attributes of the old
	Bolshevism, enriched moreover by the world experience of the recent period. Such a party
	would begin with the restoration of democracy in the trade unions and the Soviets. It
	would be able to, and would have to, restore freedom of Soviet parties. Together with the
	masses, and at their head, it would carry out a ruthless purgation of the state apparatus.
	It would abolish ranks and decorations, all kinds of privileges, and would limit
	inequality in the payment of labour to the life necessities of the economy and the state
	apparatus. It would give the youth free opportunity to think independently, learn,
	criticise and grow. It would introduce profound changes in the distribution of the
	national income in correspondence with the interests and will of the worker and peasant
	masses. But so far as concerns property relations, the new power would not have to resort
	to revolutionary measures. It would retain and further develop the experiment of planned
	economy. After the political revolution - that is, the deposing of the bureaucracy - the
	proletariat would have to introduce in the economy a series of very important reforms, but
	not another social revolution.
	</p>


	<p>
	&quot;If - to adopt a second hypothesis - a bourgeois party were to overthrow the
	ruling Soviet caste, it would find no small number of ready servants among the present
	bureaucrats, administrators, technicians, directors, party secretaries and privileged
	upper circles in general. A purgation of the state apparatus would, of course, be
	necessary in this case too. But a bourgeois restoration would probably have to clean out
	fewer people than a revolutionary party. The chief task of the new power would be to
	restore private property in the means of production. First of all, it would be necessary
	to create conditions for the development of strong farmers from the weak collective farms,
	and for converting the strong collectives into producers&#39; cooperatives of the bourgeois
	type - into agricultural stock companies. In the sphere of industry, denationalisation
	would begin with the light industries and those producing food. The planning principle
	would be converted for the transitional period into a series of compromises between state
	power and individual &quot;corporations&quot; - potential proprietors, that is, among the
	Soviet captains of industry, the &eacute;migr&eacute; former proprietors and foreign capitalists.
	Notwithstanding that, the Soviet bureaucracy has gone far toward preparing a bourgeois
	restoration the new regime would have to introduce in the matter of forms of property and
	methods of industry not a reform, but a social revolution.
	</p>

	<p>
	&quot;Let us assume - to take a third variant - that neither a revolutionary nor a
	counter-revolutionary parry seizes power. The bureaucracy continues at the head of the
	state. Even under these conditions social relations will not jell. We cannot count upon
	the bureaucracy peacefully and voluntarily renouncing itself on behalf of socialist
	equality. If at the present time, notwithstanding the too obvious inconveniences of such
	an operation, it has considered it possible to introduce ranks and decorations, it must
	inevitably in future stages seek supports for itself in property relations. One may argue
	that the big bureaucrat cares little what are the prevailing forms of property, provided
	only they guarantee him the necessary income. This argument ignores not only the
	instability of the bureaucrat&#39;s own rights, but also the question of his descendants. The
	new cult of the family has not fallen out of the clouds. Privileges have only half their
	worth, if they cannot be transmitted to one&#39;s children. But the right of testament is
	inseparable from the right of property. It is not enough to be the director of a trust; it
	is necessary to be a stockholder. The victory of the bureaucracy in this decisive sphere
	would mean its conversion into a new possessing class. On the other hand, the victory of
	the proletariat over the bureaucracy would insure a revival of the socialist revolution.
	The third variant consequently brings us back to the two first, with which, in the
	interests of clarity and simplicity, we set out.&quot; (<em>The Revolution Betrayed</em>,
	pages 252-254)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
This is how Monty Johnstone applies his &quot;Marxist&quot; method. He presents as
Trotsky&#39;s viewpoint a number of arguments, taken out of context and artificially strung
together, which in the work from which they are taken appear as part of a <em>hypothesis</em>,
(one of three!) and are conditioned by a whole series of reservations and explanations
which are simply not included anywhere in Monty Johnstone&#39;s &quot;objective&quot; account
of Trotsky&#39;s arguments.
</p>

<p>
&quot;Trotsky predicted an inevitable restoration of capitalism in Russia.&quot; Such
is the crux of Monty Johnstone&#39;s &quot;balanced&quot; arguments. But anyone who reads the
above passage from <em>The Revolution Betrayed</em> can come to no such conclusion. On the
contrary, Trotsky repeatedly emphasises that, whereas the political (anti-bureaucratic)
revolution would be faced with relatively easy tasks, any attempt on the party of the
bureaucracy to re-introduce capitalist property relationships would meet with stubborn
resistance on the part of the Soviet workers and could only succeed as the result of a
bloody struggle and civil war.

</p>

<p>
Far from predicting the imminent capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, <em>The
Revolution Betrayed </em>explains that <em>the bureaucracy is obliged to defend the State
property relations upon which it rests and from which it derives all its power and
privileges</em>. In opposition to those who described the bureaucracy as a ruling class and
the Soviet Union as &quot;state capitalist&quot;, Trotsky explained that:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;The Soviet bureaucracy has expropriated the proletariat politically in order by <em>methods
	of its own</em> to defend the social conquests. But the very fact of its appropriation of
	political power in a country where the principal means of production are in the hands of
	the state, creates a new and hitherto unknown relation between the bureaucracy and the
	riches of the nation. The means of production belong to the state. But the state, so as to
	speak &quot;belongs&quot; to the bureaucracy. If these as yet wholly new relations should
	solidify, become the norm and be legalised, whether with or without resistance from the
	workers, they would, in the long run, lead to a complete liquidation of the social
	conquests of the proletarian revolution. <em>But to speak of that now is at least
	premature. The proletariat has not yet said the last word. The bureaucracy has not yet
	created social supports for its dominion in the form of special types of property. It is
	compelled to defend state property as the source of its power and its income. In this
	aspect of its activity it still remains a weapon of proletarian dictatorship</em>.&quot; (<em>The
	Revolution Betrayed</em>, page 249, our emphasis)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
In the face of this, how is it possible for Monty Johnstone to argue that Trotsky
claimed that a capitalist restoration was taking place in the Soviet Union? Either he has
not bothered to read the book which he purports to analyse, or else he has not understood
what he has read. There is a further possibility, but we shall not bother to draw the
readers&#39; attention to that. It is sufficient to remark that if members of the Young
Communist League wish to understand what Trotsky wrote concerning Russia, they should
consult the works of Trotsky himself, and not rely upon the impartiality of their
&quot;theoreticians&quot;.
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;But Trotsky predicted the defeat of the Soviet Union and the victory of
	capitalist counter-revolution after the war!&quot; chips in Monty Johnstone (<em>Cogito</em>,
	page 33)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
On page 227 of <em>The Revolution Betrayed</em>, Trotsky writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Can we, however, expect that the Soviet Union will come out of the coming war
	without defeat? To this frankly posed question, we will answer as frankly: <em>If the war
	should remain only a war</em>, the defeat of the Soviet Union would be inevitable. In a
	technical, economic, and military sense, imperialism is incomparably more strong. <em>If it
	is not paralysed by revolution in the West</em>, imperialism will sweep away the regime
	which issued from the October Revolution.&quot; (our emphasis)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
Trotsky then proceeds to give a sober analysis of the international class balances,
concluding with the following lines:
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;The danger of war and a defeat of the Soviet Union is a reality, but the
	revolution is also a reality. If the revolution does not prevent war, then war will help
	the revolution. Second births are commonly easier than the first. In the new war, it will
	not be necessary to wait a whole two years and a half for the first insurrection. Once it
	is begun, moreover, the revolution will not this time stop half way. The fate of the
	Soviet Union will be decided in the long run not on the maps of the general staffs, but on
	the map of the class struggle. Only the European proletariat, implacably opposing its
	bourgeoisie and in the same camp with them the &quot;friends&quot; of peace, can protect
	the Soviet Union from destruction, or from an &#39;Allied&#39; state in the back. Even a military
	defeat of the Soviet Union would be only a short episode, in case of a victory of the
	proletariat in other countries. And on the other hand, no military victory can save the
	inheritance of the October revolution, if imperialism holds out in the rest of the
	world.&quot; (<em>The Revolution Betrayed</em>, pages 231-2)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
What was the situation which the Soviet Union faced at the end of World War Two? In
1945, Russia had suffered the catastrophic loss of twenty-seven million dead. Her
production of steel stood at eight million tons, as compared with 120 million produced by
America and 25 million by Britain. Moreover, the armed forces of the Anglo-American
imperialist powers remained intact - the war in Europe had resolved itself largely into a
Homeric struggle between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The atom bomb was in the hands
of the US imperialism, but not yet of Russia.
</p>



<p>
<em>All the calculations of Anglo-American imperialism had been based upon the advent of
such a situation</em>. Their policy was to weaken both German imperialism and the Soviet
Union, and to keep their hands free to strangle the Soviet Union should it succeed in
defeating Hitler. Why did this plan miscarry? What force stayed the hand of British and
American imperialism in 1945? The Red Army, as Trotsky explained in <em>The Revolution
Betrayed</em>, was a powerful factor for the defence of the gains of October; but faced
with such an overwhelmingly adverse balance of forces, even the heroism of the Red Army
would have been of no avail.
</p>



<p>
<em>The Soviet Union was saved only by the revolutionary mood of the &quot;Allied&quot;

troops and the revolutionary movement in Europe at that time</em>. Any attempt, after the
defeat of Hitler, to launch an attack upon the Soviet Union would have provoked mutinies
in every army of British and American imperialism. Trotsky had foreseen this, and was
shown by events to have been absolutely correct.
</p>

<p>
The tragedy of the Second World War, for which the workers of the Soviet Union paid a
terrible price, was the result of the criminal policies pursued by Stalin and the
bureaucracy in the period before the war itself. It was not only that Stalin&#39;s manoeuvres
on the international plane demoralised the workers of Germany and Spain and led to the
victory of Fascism in those countries. The purge trials led to the complete disruption of
the Soviet armed forces, and the economy, the undermining of the powers of defence of the
USSR, which encouraged the Nazis to attack and resulted in a series of terrible defeats in
the early days of the war when millions of Soviet troops surrendered to the Nazis without
a fight. It was not a question of military inferiority (the fire-power of the Red Army was
superior to that of the Reichswehr) but simply of the decimation of the Red Army
leadership by the purges and the myopic arrogance of Stalin and the bureaucracy, who,
while hysterically denouncing the &quot;pessimism&quot; of Trotsky, left the Soviet Union
in a state of total unpreparedness to the Fascist attack.
</p>

<h4>A Regime of Proletarian Bonapartism</h4>
<p>
Monty Johnstone has little enough to say about the causes of Stalinism. Here and there,
he drops the odd phrase about &quot;violations of Socialist legality&quot;. But, in spite
of all the bombastic phrases about the &quot;Marxist method of critical and self-critical
analysis&quot;, <em>there is not an atom of analysis throughout the entire work</em>. Monty
Johnstone picks holes in this or that phrase of Trotsky, torn out of context and
artificially juxtaposed to other passages from different works. Thus, on the one hand, he
berates Trotsky as the &quot;arch-bureaucrat&quot; obsessed with central planning; on the
other he attributes to Trotsky a &quot;defeatist&quot; attitude to socialist planning!

</p>

<p>
What was the basis of Lenin&#39;s opposition to the Stalinist bureaucracy? Lenin feared
that this stratum might choke the revolution and prepare the way for a capitalist
restoration. That did not happen, as Monty Johnstone is eager to point out in relation to
Trotsky, who also, initially, foresaw the possibility of a restoration. But, as Lenin
explained, history knows all sorts of social transformations; not merely social
revolutions and counter-revolutions, but also political revolutions and political
counter-revolutions.
</p>

<p>
To the reader of Monty Johnstone&#39;s article, it would seem inexplicable that, for a
whole historical period, &quot;socialism&quot; could express itself through the
dictatorship of one man! In reality, the history of bourgeois revolutions furnishes many
examples of similar processes. The English bourgeois revolution manifested itself in the
Protectorate of Cromwell. The Great French Revolution passed through many phases, and
eventually succumbed to the political counter-revolution of Napoleon. The reaction in
France represented, not the restoration of feudalism, but a Bonapartist,
counter-revolutionary regime which nevertheless rested on the basis of the new property
relations established by the Revolution.
</p>

<p>
It would, of course, be monstrous to suppose that such a dictatorship was compatible
with socialism, in any sense of the word as understood by Marx, Engels, Lenin or Trotsky.
But what existed in Russia was not &quot;socialism&quot;, but the dictatorship of the
proletariat; moreover, the dictatorship was taking place under certain peculiar historical
conditions; isolated, in a backward country, subject to the enormous pressures of alien
class forces. To imagine that, under these conditions, the dictatorship of the proletariat
could not undergo a series of internal transformations, but must always remain in a state
of pristine purity is to imagine that it is possible to abstract revolution from the
processes taking place in society - the exact opposite to Marxism. The proletariat is not
a &quot;sacred cow&quot; that is somehow immune from the pressures of class society.

</p>

<p>
Lenin, in trying to rid the Soviet apparatus of the menace of bureaucracy, was never
under any illusion that the problem could be solved without the help of the international
socialist revolution. And in this he was quite correct. The failure of the revolutions in
the West did not lead to capitalist counter-revolution, as Lenin and Trotsky had thought
possible. But those social processes which were generated by the isolation of the
revolution in Russia gave rise to a transformation of the workers&#39; state into the
totalitarian, Bonapartist monster that was the state under Stalin, and which continued,
with some of the ugliest warts removed, under Brezhnev and Kosygin. The state lifted
itself above the masses, usurping the ruling functions of the class, crushing the last
vestiges of workers&#39; democracy, and sealing its victory by the physical extermination of
the entire &quot;Old Bolshevik&quot; leadership.
</p>

<p>
When one reads the works of Lenin, the most striking thing is the complete absence of
the kind of haughty, bragging language of the Stalinists. Lenin was always honest,
realistic and truthful in what he wrote about the Soviet state. What they had, at that
time, was not &quot;socialism&quot;, not &quot;communism&quot;, but a <em>workers&#39; state </em>and
Lenin was not afraid to add &quot;with bureaucratic distortions&quot;. The difference was
that at that time the Soviet state was <em>moving in the direction of socialism</em>.
Inequalities existed, but the conscious effort was in the direction of equality, of
reducing the power and privileges of officials, of involving the workers in the running of
their lives, and the administration of state and industry. And what of today? The only
thing which distinguishes the Soviet Union as a workers&#39; state at all is the nationalised
economy and the plan; these are the only gains of the October Revolution that survive.
These things by themselves constitute a tremendous step forward, <em>but they even cannot
guarantee a successful transition to socialism</em>.

</p>

<p>
Far from the progress made by the planned economy leading to greater equality and
freedom for the working people, the most outrageous corruption and privilege is growing
among the upper strata, unhampered by the check of workers&#39; democracy.
</p>

<p>
The &quot;reforms&quot; from the top, just as under the Tsars, are dictated by fear of
revolution from below. They do not touch the basis of the privilege and power of the
bureaucracy. And even these crumbs are given hesitantly one minute, only to be taken back
the next.
</p>

<h4>Will the Bureaucracy &quot;wither away&quot;?</h4>
<blockquote>

	<p>
	&quot;What he [Trotsky] failed to understand&#8230;was that it is possible to have for a
	certain prolonged period, the uneasy and antagonistic coexistence of a Socialist economy
	and undemocratic, un-Socialist superstructure. Sooner or later the development of the
	former will tend to [?] push society (albeit tortuously, unevenly, and not at all
	&#39;automatically&#39;) towards reforming the superstructure [?] and bringing it more into
	keeping [?] with its economic base and the desires of its progressively more developed and
	educated working class and intelligentsia.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>, page 30)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
The rise to power of the Stalinist bureaucracy was rooted in the backwardness of
Russian society, but it would be a crude mistake, characteristic of the liberal
&quot;gradualist&quot; mentality, to assume that the bureaucracy will simply &quot;wither
away&quot; as the economy advances. That would have been true in the case of a relatively
healthy workers&#39; state with secondary bureaucratic distortions, such as Russia was in the
time of Lenin and Trotsky. But the point that Monty Johnstone seeks to gloss over is the
fact that <em>now</em> the Soviet bureaucracy constitutes a special privileged caste, a new
aristocracy, which for decades has grown accustomed to lording it over the rest of
society. It has a complete monopoly of political power, of the state apparatus, the mass
media, the police and the armed forces. Over decades it has shown itself, and is still
showing itself, to be capable of the utmost ruthlessness and barbarity in suppressing even
the mildest opposition.

</p>

<p>
The Marxist theory of the state explains how the superstructure of the state arises out
of the contradictions between classes in society. But having been established, the state
always tends to acquire a certain independence and a movement of its own. It was in this
sense that Marx and Lenin spoke of the state power as &quot;standing &#39;above&#39; society and
increasingly alienating itself from it.&quot; The measures taken by the Bolsheviks after
the Revolution were designed to <em>prevent</em> the development of such tendencies in the
Soviet state apparatus, by subjecting it to the closest checks, supervision, and control
by the working class. But once the Stalinist bureaucracy had succeeded (as Johnstone is
forced to admit) in raising itself <em>above</em> the rest of society as a special,
privileged caste, then the problem of combating bureaucracy took on an entirely different
aspect. The vested interests of the bureaucracy, its complete alienation from the working
class in whose name it purports to rule, means that a new revolutionary struggle will be
necessary - a political revolution - to throw off the yoke of bureaucratic police-rule.
</p>

<p>

Why is it that the bureaucracy clings so tenaciously to power? Is it some peculiar
trait in their mental make-up? Is it a question of &quot;personality&quot;? Not at all.
Like all other ruling classes, castes and groups in history, <em>the Soviet bureaucracy
uses the state power to defend its privileged position in society</em>. There are no more
signs of it wanting to &quot;wither away&quot; than of the capitalist class in the West
obligingly handing over its power and loot to the working class.
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone criticises Trotsky for his &quot;carping and ill-conceived&quot;
criticism of the Stalin Constitution of 1936, which abolished the Soviet system of
elections and replaced it with a Constitution which (on paper) resembled that of a
bourgeois democracy, &quot;the weakness of which lay not in its extremely democratic
provisions, but in their irrelevance to the real situation in the Soviet Union at that
time when Stalin could and did trample them underfoot.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>, page 32)

</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone condemns his arguments out of his own mouth. <em>What sort of a
&quot;Constitution&quot; is it which cannot be implemented? </em>And how was it possible
for one man to &quot;trample it underfoot&quot;? Was it just Stalin&#39;s whim? Or the
strength of his &quot;personality&quot;? We have said before, and we repeat: for an idea
to obtain mass support and become a force in human affairs, it must express the interests
of a class or group. The &quot;theory&quot; of the &quot;personality cult&quot; does not
explain anything about Stalin&#39;s Russia. One must ask the question: who benefited from the
measures taken by Stalin? Which group in society gained from the suppression of workers&#39;

democracy, from the muzzling of the trade unions, from the abolition of the maximum legal
wage, from the re-introduction of epaulettes, saluting and batmen in the army? <em>The
interests reflected in the anti-working class policies of Stalinism were those of the very
bureaucracy against which Lenin had fought - the millions of officials in the state, the
Party, the army, the collective farms, the unions.</em>
</p>

<p>
&quot;But what&#39;s this?&quot; cries Monty Johnstone, a caste consisting of millions of
people! Your bureaucracy includes &quot;all Party, Young Communist League, State,
Cooperative and collective farm leaders, officials, managers, technicians, foremen, and
their families drawn from among the most advanced sections of the working class and
peasantry and constituting when Stalin died some 22 million people.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>,
page 33)
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone dismisses the argument with a contemptuous wave of the hand, a ruling
caste of 22 million people? Whoever heard of such a ridiculous thing? What Johnstone does
not explain is that the bureaucracy, as Trotsky pointed out, is not a homogeneous stratum
but consists of a series of different layers. Trotsky no more identified the local Party
secretary with the Stalins and the Brezhnevs, than we would assert the identity of the
small shopkeeper on the street corner with the Rockefellers and the Gettys.

</p>

<p>
If the top one percent of monopoly capitalists were the only prop of capitalism in the
West, the system would collapse in a day. But the bourgeoisie maintains its class rule by
means of <em>a whole series of intermediate layers of sub-exploiters and sub-sub-exploiters</em>.
It is a similar phenomenon with the Stalinist bureaucracies of the East. The Stalin clique
was raised to power on the backs of the millions of officials. That did not prevent Stalin
from consigning hundreds of thousands of petty (and not so petty) officials to a grisly
end in the concentration camps. As in the Ottoman Empire, and in every despotic state, the
local officials are made the scapegoats for the crimes of the bureaucracy as a whole.
</p>

<p>
In the purges, Stalin drew a line of blood between the October Revolution and the new
regime of proletarian Bonapartism. Fearing the ideas of October, with their spirit of
working-class democracy and socialist internationalism, he butchered the entire &quot;Old
Bolshevik&quot; leadership, and then meted out the same treatment to anyone, including his
own supporters, who still retained any links with the old traditions of Bolshevism and
October. The Purges, as Trotsky explained, were a one-sided civil war waged by the
bureaucracy against Bolshevism. The &quot;leaders&quot; of the Soviet state have nothing
in common with October. The Khrushchevs, the Brezhnevs, the Kosygins, are all members of
the generation of gangsters and lackeys who climbed to power in the thirties over the
bloody corpse of Bolshevism.
</p>

<p>
At the present time, the inner contradictions of the Soviet Bonapartist regime are more
and more glaringly revealed. The movement of revolt among the intellectuals is a harbinger
of things to come. Marxists understand that the intelligentsia is not a class as such, but
is the social stratum which is most sensitive to the pressures and movements of classes in
society. Thus, the movement of the intellectuals in 1956 (the &quot;Crooked Circle&quot;

in Poland, the Petofi circle in Hungary) preceded the revolutionary movement of the
working class.
</p>

<p>
It is significant that certain prominent opponents of the regime in the Soviet Union
are themselves ex-members of the bureaucracy - like the &quot;retired&quot; General who
took up the case of the Crimean Tartars recently. <em>Under pressure from the working
class, the bureaucracy, which is ridden with internal contradictions has inevitably split</em>.
The lower layers, who are in touch with the working class - the local officials, Communist
Party rank and file, lower ranks of the army and police, petty functionaries - will stand
with the workers, <em>as they did in Hungary in 1956, when the top bureaucrats were left
suspended in mid-air</em>. The only resistance which the Hungarian workers met came from
the dregs of the lumpen proletariat organised in the AVO - the hated political police, who
met a bloody end at the hands of the proletariat which had suffered terribly from their
crimes.
</p>

<p>
Contrary to the &quot;gradualist&quot; illusions of Monty Johnstone, <em>there is no
possibility of the Soviet Union advancing along the road to socialism until the rule of
the bureaucrats is overthrown by a new political revolution in Russia and the other
deformed workers&#39; states</em>. The revolution will not be a social revolution aimed at
changing existing property relations. The Soviet working class does not want to go back to
capitalism, but to move forward on the basis of the achievements of industry and science
towards a higher level of workers&#39; democracy than even in the days of Lenin and Trotsky,
and then on to socialism.

</p>

<p>
The anti-bureaucratic revolution will be a revolution to wrest control of the state, of
the trade unions, of industry, out of the hands of the privileged parasites and to
re-introduce a healthy, workers&#39; democracy which would be an example and a beacon for the
workers of the rest of the world, and not the grotesque caricature that has done untold
damage to the image of Marxism-Leninism in the eyes of the world&#39;s workers. And what we
have said of Russia applies equally to the other states where capitalism and landlordism
have been overthrown: Eastern Europe, China, Cuba, North Vietnam and Korea, Syria and
Burma.
</p>

<h4>What kind of Socialism?</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;If we are going to make a meaningful estimate of Trotsky&#39;s political
	position,&quot; wrote Monty Johnstone, &quot;we must avoid arbitrary definitions that take
	the issues out of their historical context and provoke idle semantic wrangles.&quot; (<em>Cogito</em>,
	page 28)
	</p>


</blockquote>
<p>
If it is a meaningful estimate of Trotsky&#39;s political position for which we are
looking, then we had better look elsewhere. <em>Nowhere in the whole article does Monty
Johnstone explain what Trotsky actually wrote in relation to Stalinism and the Soviet
Union</em>. He confines himself to isolated fragments of quotations, which are not designed
to make Trotsky&#39;s position clear to the reader, but only to make Trotsky look foolish. It
would be a simple matter to &quot;do a job&quot; on Marx, Engels or Lenin, using the same
&quot;method&quot; - and bourgeois professors frequently have! What Monty Johnstone either
cannot or will not understand is that the same phenomenon can manifest itself differently
under different conditions, and must be dealt with in an entirely different way. Thus, on
the question of the possibility of capitalist restoration in Russia, both Lenin and
Trotsky originally regarded this as inevitable, unless the socialist revolution occurred
in the West. This was, in fact, possible up to 1927-31. But in his last work, <em>Stalin</em>,
Trotsky had already come to the conclusion that, for a number of reasons, the Stalinist
regime in Russia might last for decades in its present form.
</p>

<p>

As far as &quot;arbitrary definitions&quot; are concerned, the reader will note that no
sooner does Comrade Johnstone repudiate the very idea than he plunges into just such an
arbitrary discussion. Is socialism &quot;a society without classes, commodities, money and
state&quot;? Or is it, perhaps the &quot;conversion of the means of production into the
common property of the whole of society&quot;? Johnstone eventually plumps for
&quot;cooperative production on a large scale&quot; - and then triumphantly concludes that
&quot;socialism&quot; has been achieved, not only in the Soviet Union, but in thirteen
other countries as well!
</p>

<p>
For the moment, let us not quibble with Comrade Johnstone&#39;s &quot;definition&quot;. The
element of &quot;large scale cooperative production&quot; is undoubtedly a basic feature
of socialism. But is that <em>all</em> that socialism is? Even Monty Johnstone would not
venture to say so. On page 30 he writes:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;What had been achieved in the thirties in terms of a Socialist economy was of
	course still only the bare bones of Socialism which required several more decades of
	peaceful growth before it fully overcame the terrible legacy of Russian backwardness and
	appeared as a fully developed, <em>prosperous, harmonious and cultured Socialist society</em>.&quot;
	(our emphasis)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
In Monty Johnstone&#39;s eyes, things were not too good in Stalin&#39;s Russia. But then they
only had the &quot;bare bones&quot; of socialism, whereas now&#8230;well, Comrade
Johnstone, what about now? You see Soviet society as a &quot;fully-developed prosperous,
harmonious and cultured Socialist society&quot;. Very well, but what about all the reports
of corruption, mismanagement and nepotism with which the Soviet press abounds? The Soviet
leaders claim they are &quot;building Communism&quot; - the highest, most cultured form of
human society - yet they need the death penalty <em>for economic offences</em>. Two years
ago the <em>Morning Star </em>reported that the head of all the light industry in the Moscow
region had been shot for embezzlement. Corruption is also &quot;well-developed&quot; in
the Soviet Union. How about the gross inequalities in wages, the existence of 500 rouble
millionaires, who are certainly &quot;prosperous&quot;. And what could be more

&quot;harmonious&quot; than the relationship between the Russian and Czech bureaucracies?
Or perhaps this word is meant to designate the state of affairs in a society where all
opposition is ruthlessly crushed? As for &quot;cultural&quot; standards - they are well
maintained by packing off writers to &quot;corrective&quot; labour camps for the crime of
demanding the implementation of the Soviet Constitution!
</p>

<p>
In 1935 Stalin boasted that the building of socialism in the USSR had been
&quot;completed&quot;. At that time the death penalty applied to children of twelve! In
fact, in the propaganda of the Soviet bureaucrats &quot;socialism&quot; kept on getting

&quot;completed&quot; every few years; so frequently was socialism &quot;completed&quot;
that it became a standing joke among Soviet workers, and after Stalin&#39;s death the
bureaucracy had to drop it in favour of an even grimmer joke: it was no longer
&quot;socialism&quot; that was being built, but &quot;communism&quot; - and that in twenty
years!
</p>

<p>
Of course, the nearer we approach to the end of the twenty-year period, the less we
read, in the Communist Party press about the &quot;achievement of Communism&quot; in
Russia! Thus on page 30, Johnstone writes:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Talks of a transition to Communism in the foreseeable future made in the Stalin
	and Khrushchev era are now generally seen [!] to have contained an enormous amount of
	bombast and extravagant claims.&quot;
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, Comrade Johnstone. But what were you the Communist Party readerships writing
about this &quot;enormous amount of bombast and extravagant claims&quot; at the time of
the 22nd Congress? At that time you were busily engaged in selling this line to your
memberships. Now it seems the line has been changed again - with not a word of explanation
to the rank and file! The about-face is simply &quot;generally seen&quot; - a formula
which merely serves as a fig-leaf to cover the embarrassment of the sorry

&quot;theoreticians&quot; who yesterday were full of praise for Khrushchev, the day before
yesterday for Stalin, and who are ready in general to change their ideas and principles as
a wealthy fop changes his shirts.
</p>

<p>
The first question which would occur to any thinking member of the Communist Party is:
if Socialism has been built in the Soviet Union, if the bourgeoisie has finally been
liquidated and the class-struggle overcome, <em>why can they not allow democratic rights to
the workers?</em> We think that there is no possibility now of a capitalist restoration in
Russia or <em>any</em> of the workers&#39; states. Then why forbid the expression of opposition
points of view, the formation of various workers&#39; parties? The Soviet Union has nothing to
fear if socialism has really been built. Even bourgeois parties could be permitted
provided they did not engage in acts of terror or sabotage. You can easily permit the
former exploiters to issue broadsheets calling for a return to the &quot;good old
days&quot; of millionaire bosses, Cossack police, and mass illiteracy. They would be
treated by the workers as cranks, much as Chesterton was regarded by the English bourgeois

&quot;public&quot; when he called for a return to the &quot;Merry England&quot; of
feudalism!
</p>

<p>
Let us pose the question in another way: if it is true that socialism (by which is
meant, not merely a nationalised planned economy but the &quot;planned and harmonious
production of goods for the satisfaction of human wants&quot;) has been built in Russia,
then the hand of reaction, both internal and external, would be paralysed. The image of a <em>really</em>
&quot;fully developed, prosperous, harmonious and cultured Soviet society&quot; would
exercise a profound effect upon the hearts and minds of the workers of the capitalist
countries of the West. The impulse towards a socialist transformation would be
irresistible. But how does reality face up to Comrade Johnstone&#39;s &quot;beautiful
formula&quot;? Far from the realities of Soviet life inspiring the working class of the
West to move towards socialism, <em>it has immeasurably strengthened the hand of the
bourgeoisie, who can point to the vile deformities of totalitarianism in Russia and
Eastern Europe, and China to frighten the workers of their own countries</em>. &quot;Do you
want Communism?&quot; they cry, &quot;Here it is! That is Communism! The Berlin Wall is
Communism! Hungary 1956 is Communism! The labour-camps are Communism!&quot; The apologists
of the &quot;Communist&quot; parties have endeavoured to prettify the repugnant
physiognomy of totalitarianism by sticking the label &quot;socialism&quot; and

&quot;communism&quot; all over it. They do not succeed in whitewashing the crimes of the
Russian bureaucracy - but only in discrediting the very idea of socialism in the eyes of
the workers.
</p>

<p>
Monty Johnstone approaches the question of whether or not Socialism in One Country has
been built, not as a Marxist, but as a casuist and a (bad) formal logician. For a Marxist,
the question cannot be settled by the logic of definitions but by the <em>dialectics of
history</em>. Monty Johnstone quotes a &quot;definition&quot; from Lenin&#39;s <em>The State and
Revolution</em> but he does not explain the analysis contained in that work, of the process
whereby a workers&#39; state moves towards socialism. In <em>The State and Revolution</em>,
Lenin lays down the following conditions for a workers&#39; state, for the dictatorship of the
proletariat <em>at its inception</em>:

</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
	1. Free and democratic elections with the right of recall of all officials.
	</p>

	<p>
	2. No official to receive a higher wage than a skilled worker.
	</p>

	<p>
	3. No standing army or police force, but the armed people.
	</p>


	<p>
	4. Gradually, all the administrative tasks to be done in turn by all - every cook
	should be able to be Prime Minister - &quot;When everyone is a &#39;bureaucrat&#39; in turn,
	nobody can be a bureaucrat.&quot;
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
These were the conditions which Lenin laid down, <em>not for &quot;socialism&quot;, not
for &quot;communism&quot;, but for the very first period of a workers&#39; state - the period
of the transition from capitalism to socialism</em>. Lenin did not play with definitions of

&quot;socialism&quot;. The conditions for a workers&#39; state were not sucked out of Lenin&#39;s
thumb. They constitute <em>the generalisation of the historic experience of the working
class</em>. They are the distilled essence of the experience of the Paris Commune of
1870-72, upon which Marx based his conception of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and
which Lenin brilliantly analysed in <em>The State and Revolution</em>.
</p>



<p>
<em>The transition to socialism can only be accomplished by the active and conscious
participation of the working class in the running of society, of industry, and of the
state</em>. It is not something that is kindly handed down to them by &quot;Communist&quot;

mandarins. The whole conception of Marx, of Engels, of Lenin and Trotsky was based upon
this fact. Against the confused ideas of the anarchists, Marx argued that the workers need
a state to overcome the resistance of the exploiting classes. But that argument of Marx
has been distorted by both the reformists and the Stalinists to justify, on the one hand,
reformism, on the other, the totalitarian caricature of &quot;socialism&quot; that has
allegedly been built in the USSR. But, as Lenin emphasised, the proletariat needs only a
state that is &quot;so constituted that it will at once begin to die away and cannot help
dying away&quot; or to use the phrase of Marx, a &quot;semi-state&quot;.
</p>

<p>
Under Lenin and Trotsky, the Soviet state was so constructed as to facilitate the
drawing of workers into the tasks of control and accounting, to ensure the uninterrupted
progress of the reduction of the &quot;special functions&quot; of officialdom and of the
power of the State. Strict limitations were placed upon the salaries, power and privileges
of officials in order to prevent the formation of a privileged caste. Because of the
prevailing backwardness, and the lack of skilled labour, a wage differential was fixed at <em>not
more than four times</em>. In 1919, a People&#39;s Commissar (equivalent to a Minister)
received the same wage as a workman. Bourgeois specialists received more - but a Party
member who was also a specialist got a workman&#39;s wage.

</p>

<p>
In 1931, Stalin abolished the law fixing a maximum legal wage. The average monthly wage
of a worker in Russia today is 80-90 roubles (approximately &pound;25, or at the inflated
official exchange rate, &pound;40 at the most). But Ministers are paid up to 5,000 roubles per
month (&pound;1,250 to &pound;2,000) not counting numerous &quot;perks&quot;, like unchecked expense
accounts, private sanatoriums, private theatres, villas, bars, etc. When Trotsky built the
Red Army, it was based upon the same conceptions of working-class democracy as the state;
the old Tsarist traditions of class distinctions in uniform, rank, medals, etc, were
abolished. There was no privileged officer caste; the Red Army officers mixed freely and
on equal terms with the &quot;ranks&quot;. Under Stalin, all the old &quot;bull&quot; was
reintroduced; the officer corps reappeared in all its Byzantine magnificence: ranks,
epaulettes, saluting and batmen - all the old caste and rank worship and obsequiousness
were resurrected in the thirties. Today, in Russia and Eastern Europe, military service
represents two years&#39; hard labour, on pittance wages, while the generals and marshals lord
it over the ranks. In Bulgaria, for instance, the average monthly wage of a worker is
around 100 leva, a soldier receives 150 leva, a junior officer starts at 200 leva. And for
a Marxist, the army reveals, in a more acute form, all the contradictions of society.
</p>


<p>
Of course, no Marxist supposes that society can jump immediately from capitalism to
socialism without passing through intermediate stages, especially in a backward country.
But the essence of the transitional period is, as Lenin explained, the gradual reduction
in the powers of the state, as the majority of the population are drawn into the work of
planning the running of society. A Marxist always asks, in relation to a given society,
not only what it is, but also <em>in what direction is if moving?</em> Under Lenin and
Trotsky, the Soviet Republic was the dictatorship of the proletariat moving in the
direction of socialism. Under Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev, it is a monstrously
deformed workers&#39; state - a state in which the nationalised means of production and the
plan remains, but under the control of a totalitarian, one-Party state that is moving, <em>not
in the direction of socialism, but on the contrary, towards greater wealth, privileges and
power for the parasitic ruling caste</em>.
</p>



<p>
<em>Monty Johnstone&#39;s bland assurances that &quot;socialism&quot; has been built in the
Soviet Union constitutes a gross defamation of all the ideas of Marx and Lenin</em>. He
takes for good coin all the promises and protestations of the present ruling clique,
despite the fact that these have already been debased by the bloody suppression of the
Hungarian workers in 1956, by the continued existence of privilege, corruption, and
repression inside Russia, the invasion of Czechoslovakia, the frame-up of the writers, the
continued suppression of the works of Trotsky and the &quot;Old Bolsheviks&quot;, the
treatment meted out to minorities such as the Ukranians and the Crimean Tartars, the
blatant falsification of &quot;official&quot; history, the anti-Semitism, and so on and so
forth. The rule of the Soviet bureaucracy has made the word &quot;socialism&quot; stink.
And that, Monty Johnstone, is the great crime of Stalinism and the Communist Party
leadership internationally.

</p>

<h4>Nationalist Degeneration of Communist Parties</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;A fundamental Marxist criticism of Stalinism, which still remains to be made,
	will not proceed from Trotsky&#39;s premises, although his writings should be studied for the
	many valuable lessons - both positive and negative - that they hold for us. Yet even where
	his occasional insights are at their most brilliant it is within the framework of a
	fundamentally false model, which prevented him from understanding the laws of development
	of Soviet society or grasping the (admittedly new and unprecedented) phenomenon of
	Stalinism in its complexity and many-sidedness. Hence, the unkindness with which history
	has treated his major predictions that we have quoted in the course of this article.&quot;
	(<em>Cogito</em>, page 33)
	</p>

</blockquote>
<p>

We have already commented on the way in which, not history, but Monty Johnstone has
&quot;treated&quot; Trotsky&#39;s &quot;predictions&quot;. It is a pity that he did not also
deal with some of the &quot;predictions&quot; that were made by Stalin, or by the
Communist Party leaders in the West over the last few decades. He doesn&#39;t dare quote them.
He would not even have to resort to distortion to make them appear completely out of tune
with reality!
</p>

<p>
We hope that we have shown in this article, at least in outline, how Trotsky <em>alone</em>
provided a Marxist analysis of the &quot;admittedly new and unprecedented&quot; phenomenon
of Stalinism. As to the &quot;brilliant, complex and many-sided analyses&quot; of the
Brezhnevs and Kosygins, of the Dutts and Klugmans, we are still searching for those.
History has not dealt unkindly with them - because they were never made!

</p>

<p>
How &quot;unkindly&quot; has history dealt with Trotsky&#39;s most important prognosis? In
1928, in his <em>Critique of the Draft Programme of the Communist International</em>,
Trotsky wrote that the &quot;theory&quot; of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot;, if it
were adopted by the International, would inevitably lead to <em>the nationalist
degeneration of the Communist International</em>:
</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Revolutionary patriotism can only have a class character. It begins as patriotism
	to the party organisation, to the trade union, and rises to state patriotism when the
	proletariat seizes power. Whenever the power is in the hands of the workers, patriotism is
	a revolutionary duty. But this patriotism must be an inseparable part of revolutionary
	internationalism. Marxism has always taught the workers that even their struggle for
	higher wages and shorter hours cannot be successful unless waged as an international
	struggle. And now it suddenly appears that the ideal of the socialist society may be
	achieved with the national forces alone. This is a mortal blow to the International.
	</p>

	<p>
	&quot;The invincible conviction that the fundamental class aim, even more so than the
	partial objectives, cannot be realised by national means or within national boundaries,
	constitutes the very heart of revolutionary internationalism. If, however, the ultimate
	aim is realisable within national boundaries through the efforts of a national
	proletariat, then the backbone of internationalism has been broken. The theory of the
	possibility of realising socialism in one country destroys the inner connection between
	the patriotism of the victorious proletariat and the defeatism of the proletariat of the
	bourgeois countries. The proletariat of the advanced capitalist countries is still
	travelling on the road to power. How, and in what manner it marches towards it depends
	entirely upon whether it considers the task of building the socialist society a national
	or an international task.

	<p>
	&quot;If it is at all possible to realise socialism in one country then one can believe
	in that theory not only <em>after</em> but also <em>before</em> the conquest of power. If
	socialism can be realised within the national boundaries of backward Russia then there is
	all the more reason to believe that it can be realised in advanced Germany. Tomorrow the
	leaders of the Communist Party of Germany will undertake to propound this theory. The
	draft programme empowers them to do so. The day after tomorrow the French party will have
	its turn. <em>It will be the beginning of the disintegration of the Comintern along the
	lines of social-patriotism</em>.&quot; (<em>The Third International After Lenin</em>, pages
	71-72, our emphasis)

<p>
<em>In these lines, Trotsky brilliantly anticipated the collapse of the Third
International, and the nationalist degeneration of the &quot;Communist&quot; Parties,
decades in advance</em>. After cynically using the Comintern as the border-guard of the
Soviet Union, Stalin contemptuously disbanded it in 1943, as a gesture of
&quot;good-will&quot; to his imperialist allies. At the very time when, under the impact
of the War, millions of workers in Italy, in Greece, in China, in Eastern Europe, in
Britain, were moving in the direction of revolution, the Third International was consigned
to the rubbish bin of history.
</p>

<p>
It is true that, for a number of reasons, Stalinism emerged temporarily strengthened
from the Second World War. This was mainly because of the utter bankruptcy of capitalism
on a world scale; its powerlessness to intervene against Russia at the end of the War. The
revolutionary movement of the working class in Britain, in France, in Italy, plus the mood
of the &quot;allied&quot; workers in uniform, paralysed the hand of imperialism.

</p>

<p>
The inability of imperialism to intervene in Eastern Europe and China, plus the
rottenness of capitalism in those areas, led to the rapid overthrow of capitalism and
landlordism, which, according to Monty Johnstone, irrefutably demonstrates the
incorrectness of Trotsky&#39;s accusation of the counter-revolutionary nature of Stalinism. He
does not mention the situation in France, where the Communist Party which enjoyed mass
support because of the heroic part played by the membership in the Resistance, entered a
coalition government with de Gaulle; or Italy, where Stalin instructed the mass Communist
Party to support the &quot;ex-Fascist&quot; Badoglio, at a time when the Northern cities
were in the hands of the workers; of Greece, where the 200,000-strong Communist Party-led
guerrillas were told to lay down their arms and &quot;await elections&quot;, while
Grievas&#39; thugs were shooting down Communists in the streets; or Britain, where the
Communist Party stood for a &quot;National Front&quot; government - including Churchill!
</p>

<p>
The collapse of landlordism and capitalism in China and Eastern Europe, and its
replacement by nationalised planned economies, was a heavy blow to imperialism on a world
scale. In particular, the victory of the Chinese Red Army in 1949 was the second greatest
event of the twentieth century, after the October Revolution of 1917. By this event, the
multi-millioned peasant masses of China for the first time stepped on to the stage of
history.

</p>

<p>
These developments were welcomed at the time by the British Marxists, who never doubted
that they would enable these backward countries to commence the historic task of
overcoming the problems left over from the semi-feudal past. But we also understood
clearly the contradiction implicit in the type of &quot;revolutions&quot; that occurred in
China and Eastern Europe. We understood that they had been carried through by the
Stalinist readerships in a Bonapartist fashion. Using the Red Army as a battering ram, the
Russian bureaucracy crushed the weak, toothless bourgeoisie and installed their own
creatures in its place. Balancing between the classes, they created a state in the image
of Moscow. For the rule of workers&#39; soviets was substituted &quot;national&quot; variants
of the Russian model of Stalinism, with all the hideous deformities of one-Party
totalitarian police-states. <em>The Eastern European and Chinese &quot;revolutions&quot;
began where the Russian Revolution ended; grotesquely deformed regimes of proletarian
Bonapartism</em>.
</p>


<p>
Since the Second World War, we have seen the truth of Trotsky&#39;s analysis of
&quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; confirmed in a most striking manner. Instead of the
united, &quot;harmonious&quot; socialist bloc to which Monty Johnstone refers, we have the
nauseating spectacle, in the first place, of the oppression and plunder of Eastern Europe
by the Russian bureaucracy after the War, and then, the wholesale break-up of the
Stalinist &quot;bloc&quot; along nationalist lines, starting with the Yugoslav debacle and
culminating in the soldiers of Russian and Chinese &quot;socialism&quot; shooting each
other down with tanks, planes, and guns in border clashes.
</p>

<p>

The October Revolution won the ear of the workers of the advanced capitalist countries
by its clarion call of socialist internationalism. The Bolshevik appeal for &quot;a peace
without annexations or indemnities&quot; struck a responsive chord in the hearts of the
millions of war-weary workers of <em>all</em> belligerent nations, including Germany. The
propaganda and fraternisation, conducted on class lines, caused wholesale disaffection in
the ranks of the German army, and later in the foreign armies of intervention.
</p>

<p>
During the Second World War the Russian bureaucracy utilised the most shameless
chauvinistic prejudices in its propaganda. Instead of a position of proletarian
internationalism, they proclaimed the idea that &quot;the only good German is a dead
one&quot;, in a thinly disguised form. And this anti-German element still pervades the
propaganda of the Stalinists. The policy of the Russian bureaucracy was: <em>make the
German working class pay for the crimes of Hitler, whose victory was made possible by the
criminal actions of the German Social Democratic leaders on the one hand and of Stalin and
the leaders of the German Communist Party on the other</em>. Ten million Germans were
forcibly expelled from Eastern Europe after the War, of which anything up to two million
perished in transit under barbarous conditions.
</p>

<p>
In the years after the War, the Russian bureaucracy plundered Eastern Europe, East
Germany had to pay reparations of 16 billion dollars, Romania and Hungary paid out 570
million and 400 million dollars respectively. Not only the &quot;enemy&quot;, but also the
other Eastern European countries were systematically stripped of industry, rolling-stock,
etc, which were carted off to Russia. <em>Thus, it was the crimes of the Stalinist
chauvinists after the War which gave rise artificially to reactionary movements among the
expelled population in West Germany, and made the word &quot;Communism&quot; stink among
the German working class, which before the War was &quot;the reddest in Europe&quot;</em>.

</p>

<p>
Before the War, Eastern Europe was notorious for its national divisions. Capitalism and
the bourgeois nation state showed themselves impotent to deal peacefully and rationally
with the problems arising from this complex patchwork quilt of nationalities and
languages. These national divisions have been the bane of Eastern Europe, a major factor
in perpetuating the backwardness of the region, the poverty and misery of the masses, and
the brutal oppression of national minorities<em>. If the Stalinists had still retained one
iota of the traditions of Bolshevik internationalism, they would have advanced the slogan
of a Socialist Federation of Eastern Europe, based upon a common economic plan and linked
up to the enormous resources and potential of the USSR</em>.
</p>

<p>
The &quot;Balkanisation&quot; of Eastern Europe, which was deliberately fostered by the
Russian Stalinists after the War has inevitably given rise to the present situation. As
foreseen in advance by Trotsky, each national bureaucratic clique is nursing its
&quot;own&quot; borders! This at a time when even in the West, the bourgeoisie is faced
with the contradiction between the narrow limits of the national market and the imperative
demands of the modern economy. Although, of course, on the basis of the private ownership
of the means of production, there is no solution to this contradiction.
</p>

<p>
The results of this national &quot;socialism&quot; are grotesque. At present in
Yugoslavia, there are 300,000 unemployed and a further 400,000 who cannot find work in
their &quot;socialist&quot; fatherland and are forced to work in the West. Across the
border in &quot;socialist&quot; Bulgaria? Where they speak a similar language, there are
enterprises working at 45-50% of capacity because of the shortage of semi-skilled
operators. (<em>The Economist</em>, Jan 20, 1968) Czechoslovakia and East Germany also
suffer from a shortage of labour thanks mainly to the expulsion of the Sudetenland Germans
and the mass exodus from the repugnant Stalinist regime of Ulbricht.

</p>

<p>
The most criminal manifestation of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; however, is the
Sino-Soviet split. Monty Johnstone points to the victory of the Chinese Red Army in 1949
as &quot;proof&quot; that &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; is not incompatible with
revolutionary socialist internationalism. But the Chinese Stalinists took power <em>in
spite </em>of the &quot;fraternal&quot; advice of their Soviet &quot;comrades&quot;. Stalin
favoured a partition of China or a coalition government with Chiang Kai-Shek!

</p>

<p>
It would be interesting to see Monty Johnstone&#39;s analysis of the Sino-Soviet dispute,
which he does not mention once in his article! What is the explanation of this, Comrade
Johnstone? Is it yet another &quot;tragic mistake&quot;? Or is it the result of Mao&#39;s
&quot;personality cult&quot;? If Stalin&#39;s &quot;personality&quot; could hold the entire
Russian people in terror, then Mao presumably can also manipulate 700 million Chinese on
the strength of his! In reality, Monty Johnstone and the &quot;theoreticians&quot; of
Stalinism have <em>no</em> explanation of the Sino-Soviet split. And there can be no
explanation, if we accept that both Russia and China are &quot;socialist countries&quot;.

</p>

<p>
The Sino-Soviet split (which was predicted even before Mao&#39;s armies came to power by
the British Marxists, who based themselves on the prognoses of Trotsky, to which history
is alleged to have been so &quot;unkind&quot;) has nothing whatever to do with questions
of theory and ideology. <em>It is the result of a clash of interests between two rival
national bureaucracies</em>. Like two rival gangs in the Chicago of Al Capone, the Russian
and Chinese bureaucracies are not prepared to share their power and wealth with anyone,
and jealously guard &quot;their territory&quot; against the intrusions of their
&quot;fraternal comrades&quot;.
</p>

<p>
From a Marxist point of view the Sino-Soviet dispute is a monstrous occurrence which
could never take place between two genuine healthy workers&#39; states. It is a crime which
not only does untold damage to the cause of socialism on a world scale, but also stands in
fundamental opposition to the interests of the workers and peasants of both Russia and
China.

</p>

<p>
An elementary demand which a genuinely Marxist-Leninist Party would have raised long
ago would be: <em>a Socialist Federation of Russia and China</em>. The Russian bureaucracy
has been trying to open up the vast expanses of Soviet Asia, which contain untold mineral
wealth, the tapping of which could transform the entire way of life of the Soviet people.
The main obstacle is the shortage of labour; Soviet workers are reluctant to leave Moscow
and Leningrad to go to Central Asia. On the other hand, the vast population of China
provides a huge potential labour force for this historic task. Yet, when Chinese cross the
&quot;border&quot;, an arbitrary, meaningless line that cuts across all natural units,
they are forcibly expelled by units of the Red Army. At the same time, the Russian
bureaucracy is busily negotiating with Japanese Big Business for the opening up of
Siberia!
</p>

<p>
For all their cynical blustering about &quot;proletarian internationalism&quot;,
neither the Chinese nor the Russian bureaucracy has advanced the real internationalist
programme for the linking-up of the two great economic giants of Russia and China in the
interests of both peoples. Instead, we have witnessed the spectacle of the border clashes,
the criminal murder of Russian and Chinese workers in uniform, the even more criminal and
atrocious propaganda of the Russian and Chinese Stalinists, which is not merely
chauvinistic, but has even racialist overtones.
</p>

<p>
This is the reality of Monty Johnstone&#39;s &quot;thirteen socialist countries&quot;,
thirteen totalitarian states, ruled over by thirteen nationalist bureaucracies, who
communicate between each other in the fraternal language of machine-guns and rockets!

</p>

<p>
But Trotsky&#39;s prognosis holds good on yet another question. In the <em>Critique of the
Draft Programme of the Comintern</em>, Trotsky points out that the &quot;theory&quot; of
&quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; signifies the danger of nationalist degeneration, not
only <em>after</em>, but also <em>before</em> the conquest of power. And what is the position
with the Parties of the former Communist International today? <em>Everywhere, whether in
power, or out of power, the so-called &quot;Communist&quot; parties display all the
repulsive features of nationalist degeneration</em>.

</p>

<p>
For decades, the &quot;leaderships&quot; of the Communist Parties internationally
kow-towed, in a truly abject manner, to the dictates of the Russian Stalinist bureaucracy.
Their policies consisted of a series of contradictory twists and turns, in accordance with
the latest manoeuvres of Stalin; now denouncing Social-Democratic workers as
&quot;scabs&quot; and &quot;proto-fascists&quot;; now calling for unification with the
bourgeois parties of so-called Liberalism; now opposing the war with Germany on the basis
of a peace on Hitler&#39;s terms; now adopting the role of the worst strike-breakers &quot;in
the national interest&quot; after 1941.
</p>

<p>

Monty Johnstone, by means of manipulated quotations, tries to &quot;prove&quot; the
inconsistency of Trotsky&#39;s analysis of the Soviet Union. But the series of political
somersaults performed by his friends, Pollitt, Dutt, Gollan, Campbell, <em>et alia </em>in
the past beggar description. Such manoeuvres have nothing in common with Marxism and the
Marxist method - they are merely proof of the utterly unprincipled approach of <em>all</em>
the Communist Party leaders.
</p>

<p>
Over the last two decades, the Stalinist &quot;Monolith&quot; has suffered a series of
crushing blows: the Yugoslav split, the Polish events and the Hungarian revolution of
1956, and especially the Sino-Soviet split, have all weakened the iron grip of the Russian
bureaucracy on the international movement. But what alternative do the
&quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;left&quot; Communist Party leaders pose to &quot;the
Moscow line&quot;? A return to the ideas of Lenin? Far from it.

</p>



<p>
<em>The leaders of the Communist Parties everywhere have taken advantage of the situation
to assert the right of each national bureaucracy to rule its own roost</em>. The
&quot;British Road to Socialism&quot;, the &quot;Polish Road to Socialism&quot; - are each
manifestations of the narrow, national mentality of the Communist Party leadership and its
determination to guard its own leading position in &quot;its own&quot; country, without
any &quot;interference&quot; from outside.

</p>

<p>
The stand taken by a number of foreign Communist Parties over Czechoslovakia was proof
of this. They were not going to &quot;carry the can&quot; for the actions of the Russian
bureaucracy as they had, with disastrous results, in 1956. The Gollans, the Dutts, the
Monty Johnstones, have made no attempt to analyse or explain the invasion of
Czechoslovakia. &quot;Is it not enough that the Party leadership dissociated itself from
the invasion? What are you complaining about?&quot; Yes, comrades, but what interests a
Marxist is not merely pious gestures (the right-wing Labour leaders also &quot;dissociated
themselves&quot; from the invasion of Czechoslovakia!) but <em>an explanation</em>.
</p>

<p>
The real reason why Brezhnev and Co decided to invade Czechoslovakia is <em>because they
feared the effect which even the slightest democratic concessions in Czechoslovakia would
have had upon the workers in Russia</em>. Their action was evidence of jittery nerves, not
confidence and strength. Yet the Gollans and the Johnstones continue to act as though it
were merely a &quot;tragic mistake&quot; on the part of the Soviet bureaucracy!<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup>

</p>

<p>
The &quot;independent&quot; stand of the Communist Party readerships in the West
vis-&agrave;-vis Moscow is only one side of the coin. On the other side, we have the persistent
efforts of the Gollans and the Waldeck-Rochets to ingratiate themselves with
&quot;their&quot; national bourgeois &quot;public opinion&quot;. The &quot;new look&quot;
of the Stalinists is even more repulsive than the old. It is a caricature of the wretched
reformism of the Social Democratic leaders. Thus, the <em>Daily Worker </em>becomes the <em>Morning
Star</em>, the Communist Party leaders in all their pronouncements emphasise the
non-revolutionary, bourgeois respectability of the Party, its profound patriotism which
wants to put the &quot;Great&quot; back in Britain. Evidently, the Communist leaders want
to prove they can sing the national anthem louder than the Tory or right-wing Labour
leaders! The Union Jack features on every large Communist Party demonstration; after all,
it is &quot;our&quot; flag&#8230;!

</p>

<p>
It was significant that the same Communist Party &quot;theoreticians&quot; who
criticised the invasion of Czechoslovakia, were also most vocal in support of the
disgraceful role played by the leadership of the French Communist Party and CGT during and
after the May events last year.
