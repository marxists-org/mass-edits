The international solidarity 
of German printers and workers (and Turkish workers in Germany) has 
foiled the plans of <i>The Times</i>&rsquo; management to produce a weekly 
international edition. Only a few thousand copies were printed at an 
&ldquo;undisclosed location&rdquo;. This arises from the dispute and lock-out at <i>The Times</i> London headquarters.
</p>
<p>
The millionaire Thomson Group 
which owns <i>The Times</i> and a string of provincial newspapers in 
Britain wanted to use <i>The Times</i> to break the resistance of workers 
to the introduction of &ldquo;new technology&rdquo; at the expense of rights, conditions and standards of print workers.
</p>
<p>
They want&mdash;over a period&mdash;to 
eliminate most type-setters&rsquo; jobs. Thus, as always under capitalism, 
technological progress does not lead to shorter hours and higher wages 
but to massive redundancies.
</p>
<p>
When the print unions and especially 
the National Graphical Association (NGA) refused to accept their terms, 
management stopped publication and dismissed the workforce&mdash;i.e. locked 
out the workers. But in defence of jobs, rights and living standards <i>
The Times</i>&rsquo; printers and unions have stood firm for five months.
</p>
<p>
This attempt to print the international 
weekly abroad was intended as a wedge to break their resistance. They 
used a small type-setting firm in Darmstadt where only half the 20 employees 
were union members to set up the paper. For their printers <i>The Times</i>&rsquo; 
management chose a small Turkish firm in Germany which prints an extreme 
&ldquo;right wing&rdquo; i.e. fascist Turkish paper.
</p>
<p>
Hundreds of Turkish and German 
print workers and other workers mobilised by the German print unions 
picketed the plant. They demonstrated against scabbing on their British 
trade union brothers. So strong was the pressure that <i>The Times</i>&rsquo; 
management abandoned the attempt to print this first edition.
</p>
<p>
The NGA has been in touch with 
the print unions in 35 countries to ask for the &ldquo;blacking&rdquo; of <i>
Times</i>&rsquo; work. All have agreed to be vigilant in case <i>The Times</i> 
makes further attempts.
</p>
<p>
Coupled with the decision of 
NUJ members in <i>The Times</i>&rsquo; chapel to reverse their previous 
decision, and not to work on the overseas weekly, this is a crushing 
answer to <i>The Times</i>&rsquo; management tactics.
</p>
<p>
This is an inspiring example 
of workers&rsquo; international unity and class solidarity in action. Such 
action nationally and internationally is the key to success for the 
struggle of the print workers.
