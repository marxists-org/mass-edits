<p class="fst">A new world recession is developing at the
present time. This marks the definitive end of the world economic
upswing. It expresses the twilight of world capitalism and shows
that the economic system internationally has reached an impasse.
The mightiest power, American capitalism, finds itself in serious
economic difficulties. As a consequence of a large balance of
payments deficit and the deficit financing in the budget, she is
faced with 12 per cent to 15 per cent inflation. This has caused
the collapse of the dollar. Gold, from being $34 an ounce - which
American imperialism artifically kept as the exchange rate for a
whole historical period - is now over $300 an ounce. American
imperialism finds itself with the two evils of capitalism in the
present epoch - inflation and stagnation - at one and the same
time.</p>


<p>The recession in the biggest market in the
world, that of American capitalism, will in its turn have a chain
reaction on the EEC and on the smaller powers. But the recession
will be of a peculiar character, it will be 'a small recession'.
It is projected by bourgeois statisticians and economists that
there will be an actual fall in industrial production only in
Britain and the United States. In Japan and the EEC countries
there will be a fall in the rate of growth of production. 'Small'
recessions of this character, following upon 'small' booms, will
have more explosive political consequences than even a deep
recession.</p>


<p>This recession has followed the shaky boom
which in its turn followed the recession of 1975. In that
recovery, what marked a new crisis for capitalism was that there
was hardly a single capitalist country using more than 80 per
cent of productive capacity. This in its turn meant a fall in the
rate of investment. With this very shaky recovery from the first
simultaneous world slump since the second world war, the
capitalists are already faced with a new recession.</p>


<p>As we predicted, the new recession has come
swiftly on the heels of the last one. It is roughly three to four
years since the last slump or small recession and we are now back
to what will possibly be a somewhat deeper recession than that of
1975.</p>


<p>However, we must view cautiously the economic
processes. The slump in 1975 only meant, so far as the OECD
countries together were concerned, a fall in production of 0.5
per cent. But it also meant unemployment of 16-20 millions.</p>


<p>Unemployment will now increase in all the main
capitalist countries of the world. It no longer merely forms a
reserve army of labour but indicates an organic sickness of
capitalism as it did in the inter-war period.</p>


<p>This new recession, which might last anything
from 9 months to 18 months - possibly more possibly less - will
in its turn be followed by a new shaky boom. This in turn will be
followed at a faster or slower rate, by a new recession. We are
in a cycle of booms and slumps moving far faster than at any
other time in the history of capitalism.</p>


<p>It means that we are now in the epoch of the
death agony of capitalism. <em>There will be a tendency for
living standards to fall in all the countries of capitalism,
including the industrial countries, with only temporary
exceptions.</em></p>


<p>This rapid succession of booms and slumps is
precisely a period in which revolutionary conclusions can be
drawn by the masses. In a sense, small changes leading to minor
booms and then to minor slumps mean the worst of all possible
outcomes for capitalism.</p>


<p>As Trotsky explained, the constant change from
one economic situation to another produces uncertainty which in
its turn has a political effect on the masses. Thus, a period of
political explosions opens up - in Spain, Italy and France, West
Germany, Japan, the USA and even Scandinavia - as the case of
Denmark shows. This formerly placid country has had a whole
series of general strikes in the past half decade or so. Now in
certain 'backwaters' of capitalism, such as formerly prosperous
Australia, Canada and New Zealand, we see a whole series of
struggles on the part of the working class leading to a situation
of virtual general strike.</p>


<p>This instability of capitalism in its turn has
an effect on the outlook of the bourgeoisie in all countries of
the world. There has been an outbreak of pessimism, gloom and
fear as to the economic future. The decay of capitalism is
reflected in its representatives becoming totally perplexed.</p>


<p>Meanwhile, in the traditional organisations of
the working class, the Stalinists and reformists are reflecting
the previous period of capitalism in its economic upswing. They
are utterly incapable of evaluating the new stage in the
development of world history. The objective conditions for
socialist revolution exist in all the countries of capitalism at
the present time.</p>


<p>The impasse of capitalism is reflected in the
aggravation of the contradictions between social production on
the one hand and national states and private ownership on the
other. The latter becomes an enormous drain and fetter on the
development of the productive forces (in which Marxists find the
key to history). Capitalism is no longer capable of fulfilling
this task as it succeeded in doing for a period of two to three
decades after the war.</p>


<p>The capitalist countries partially overcame the
contradictions for a time by the development of world trade and
the lowering of tariff and other barriers between the capitalist
nations. The domination of American imperialism was sufficient to
dictate this policy to her rivals, and that was a means of
partially overcoming the limits of capitalism - the nation state
and private ownership. World trade increased about six times in
the period from 1947-75.</p>


<p>Through GATT (General Agreements on Tariff and
Trade) and other measures we had the internationalisation of
markets. There was a deepening of the world division of labour
and an extension of the integration of the world economy into one
indivisible whole.</p>


<p>The internationalisation of capital took place
through the multi-nationals. Perhaps for the last time an impetus
was given to the development of productive forces in the
industrialised countries and partly even in the undeveloped
countries of the world as well.</p>


<p>But in the partial overcoming of these
contradictions, greater contradictions have been created by
capitalism. The economy, in reality, has developed beyond the
limits provided by the capitalist system. That is why we are in
the twilight of world capitalism - an epoch of revolutions and of
minor 'secondary wars'. ('Secondary' is in quotation marks
because even in the Arab-Israeli war enormous resources were
squandered.)</p>


<p>However, the death throes of capitalism will
not appear in one simultaneous sweep. In the period of the
economic upswing capitalism has created <em>enormous resources
which can, and will, be used for the purpose of propping up
capitalism when its life is in danger. </em>At a time of mass
upsurge the capitalists will give concessions in order to gain a
breathing space. They will take them back as soon as the
situation has changed and the mass movement of the working class
has ebbed. This, of course, is inevitable, given the conditions
under which the masses live in capitalist society.</p>


<p>That is why under modern conditions the <em>subjective
factor </em>is perhaps the most important factor of all. Time and
again, the role of the leadership of the workers' organisations
has been to save capitalism from destruction at the hands of the
working class. However, there will be not just one revolutionary
crisis but a whole series of revolutionary crises in one country
after another in the period that lies ahead. Again, capitalism
has changed from being a <em>relative </em>fetter holding up the
development of productive forces into being an <em>absolute </em>fetter.
As Marxism teaches us, this is the epoch of social revolution.</p>


<p>If we take even the strongest capitalist power,
America, we can see the perplexity of the ruling class. With this
goes a corresponding perplexity of the masses of the people.
There is an unprecedented disgust with both political parties -
with the Democrats, to which the trade union leaders have
attached the trade unions merely as a tail, and with the
Republicans as virtually open representatives of big business.</p>


<p>The reason for this is that during the course
of the past 12 years there has not been an actual increase in
workers' real incomes before tax. After tax there has even been a
fall in the living standards of the American working class. In
the last seven years there has actually been a decline in real
incomes before tax.</p>


<p>That explains the attitude of the masses
towards the bourgeois parties - the repulsion, the scepticism and
the cynicism towards the Democrats, towards President Carter and
towards the Republicans.</p>


<p>In the blind alley of American capitalism the
government threshes about from one economic policy to the
opposite one. This in turn adds to the instability of the
economy.</p>


<p>Very rapidly the American workers can come to
the conclusion that they need to organise an independent party of
Labour. If the Democrats win the election through adopting Edward
Kennedy as their candidate (as seems most likely) a big blow will
be dealt to any illusions which remain in that party.<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup> The
working class blacks and other oppressed layers would be pushed
into industrial and political action.</p>


<p>The organised workers would exert pressure for
an independent proletarian organisation of labour and the
exploited masses. With the sluggish nature of the boom in
America, and following it, the effects of stagflation, political
conclusions can be rapidly drawn by the American workers. The
tempo of American life is different from that in Europe. The
American workers can achieve in seven years what has taken the
British workers 70 years to achieve - the creation of a mass
party of labour.</p>


<p>The economic upswing had the effect of
powerfully reinforcing support for capitalism. Skilled sections
of the workers gained high standards of living. They would have
two cars, a boat, a shotgun, good holidays and so on, and quite a
comfortable level of existence.</p>


<p>Now that has ended. Even when the recession is
followed by a further period of anaemic boom, it will require
enormous efforts on the part of the American workers to win back
what they have lost through the inflation of the last few years.
It will require strenuous battles and strike struggles, probably
on a considerably higher level than the impressive strikes of the
past two years. The fact that a minimum of 10 million workers in
the USA are unemployed, and 16 to 20 million in the OECD
countries as a whole, shows that economically, world capitalism
cannot repeat the balmy experience of 1950-75.</p>


<p>There will be periods of upsurge, periods of
revolution, periods of struggles, by workers in every capitalist
country. They will be succeeded by new periods of bafflement,
despair and indifference, stemming from the frustration of the
movement of the workers by the policies of the socialist and
communist parties. But over a period of 10 to 15 years, the
masses will rapidly come to the conclusion that there is no other
road than that of the socialist revolution.</p>


<p>It is significent in this respect that both in
Holland and in Australia the workers in the more dynamic unions
are coming to the conclusion that there has to be a
root-and-branch transformation of society. Tinkering with
capitalism, they recognise, cannot solve the problems of the
working people. And this objective process as far as the unions
are concerned indicates the possibilities that lie ahead for a
Marxist tendency.</p>


<p>Even on the basis of the situation that exists
at the present time, such a tendency can grow by leaps and
bounds. <em>Workers will continue as they have done over a period
of decades to turn to the traditional organisations of the
working class. </em>But as we already see in relation to the
Labour Party, a differentiation will begin within the framework
of the social democracy and also within the Communist parties
(where they are a mass force, and even in countries where they
are weak).</p>


<p>More and more, the active layers of the working
class will be demanding policies in the interests of the workers.
They will see that these interests can only be served by a
transformation of society. In this atmosphere, it is entirely
possible for the ideas of Marxism to secure a powerful hold
within the traditional organisations of the class at a time when
the crisis of capitalism is deepening.</p>


<p>This mood will not be changed by shaky booms of
a few years' duration which do not fundamentally enhance the
working class's standard of living as it was enhanced during the
course of the, '50s, '60s, and '70s. As a consequence, the
climate will be there for the ideas of Marxism and Leninism to
gather enormous support in the mass organisations of the working
class.</p>


<p>The growth of contradictions in the capitalist
world is matched by the contradictions developing in the Soviet
bloc and China. In Eastern Europe and Russia, from being a <em>relative
</em>fetter the bureaucracy is becoming an <em>absolute </em>fetter
on the development of the forces of production.</p>


<p>For a whole historical period most of the
countries of Eastern Europe and especially Russia have had a <em>lower
</em>rate of the development of the productive forces than
capitalist Japan. This is because the productive forces are
snared in a mesh of bureaucratic mismanagement, chaos, waste and
corruption which partially cancel out the advantages of state
ownership and a plan of production. Where there is no workers'
democracy and no check on production it leads to a chaotic
situation. The working masses are used merely as another factor
in production. New contradictions have developed.</p>


<p>The bureaucracy has raised itself as a
privileged caste, separate and above the mass of the population.
Productive forces are going ahead at a snail's pace for a
state-owned, planned economy - slower than capitalist development
in Western Europe during the boom.</p>


<p>The bureaucracy tends to try to find a way out
of the contradictions in the economy which it has itself produced
by an increased participation on the world market. The illusions
of building socialism in one country are at an end in China where
Mao's ideas of autarky have been overthrown.</p>


<p>Also in the Soviet Union, autarky is now seen
as an entirely impractical policy. It restricted productive
forces and prevented the development of the economy to the
maximum extent. That wing of the bureaucracy which wanted to
continue Stalinist policies in this respect has been utterly
defeated. In the new Russian constitution, which Brezhnev for his
own reasons has had adopted, 'participation in the world market'
is put as one of the fundamental aims of the state. That is
intended as a warning to those sections of the bureaucracy who
still hanker for an autarkic policy.</p>


<p>This is confirmation of Trotsky's brilliant
prediction that, with the growth of productive forces in Russia,
she would be compelled more and more to move into the world
market. The persistence of the idea of autarky in such a
situation is an indication of the reactionary and nationalist
character of the bureaucracies of all the Stalinist states. Even
with the expansion of world trade links they cannot regain the
growth rates of the past. That constitutes a death sentence for
these bureaucracies. China remains probably one of the few
deformed workers' states which is still <em>relatively </em>progressive
in her development of productive forces.</p>


<p>The crisis in Vietnam, which caused anyone of
Chinese ethnic origin to flee, is just one indication of the
horrors of Stalinist totalitarian rule. The unfortunate plight of
the so-called 'boat people' has given a magnificent opportunity
to capitalism for propaganda against the ideas of 'Communism'.
The limited war between China and Vietnam served to smear the
ideas of communism. The crimes of the Vietnamese Stalinists as
well as of the Chinese Stalinists stink to high heaven,
perpetrated as they are in the name of Marxism.</p>


<p>In Vietnam and China, in Ethiopia and the other
deformed workers' states that have been set up in the former
colonial world, there is a relatively progressive role for the
bureaucracies. They can develop the productive forces faster than
capitalism. Consequently there will be relative stability for
these Stalinist regimes in the coming period.</p>


<p>In Eastern Europe and Russia, on the other
hand, beneath the official mask, enormous discontent has been
gathering. The decay of official 'Marxism' is expressed in Poland
in the gigantic demonstration in favour of the Pope's visit. The
masses are opposed to bureaucratic misrule. However, there is not
the slightest ripple of a movement by the masses in the direction
of accepting capitalism as an alternative. In Eastern Europe, new
Hungarian revolutions are inevitable.</p>


<p>In Russia too, all the elements of discontent
have been gathering up for decades. The oppression of the
nationalities, the oppression of the peasants, the
differentiation of standards between the workers and the
bureaucrats have produced explosive contradictions. Over a period
of two generations an hereditary bureaucracy has been created to
which access on the part of the talented workers has gradually
been closed. That is an indication of the ossification of the
regime.</p>


<p>In every layer of the population, hatred for
the bureaucracy is accumulating. The masses are well aware of the
inefficiencies, the waste, and the inability of the bureaucracy
to develop the productive forces. According to the capitalist
press and the economists, it is expected that this year the
growth of industry in Russia will only be about 3 per cent, which
again is lower than the extremely low figures to which Japan's
growth has dropped in the last few years, and way below the
previous rates of 12-14 per cent per annum achieved by capitalist
Japan. It means the bureaucracy is no longer capable of
fulfilling the role of developing the productive forces.</p>


<p>Like the bourgeoisie of the West they have
become a drag on society. They were always parasites on the
masses, but had a relatively progressive role to play - now they
are only parasites. This means that at any time there could be an
explosion in Russia like that of Hungary in 1956.</p>


<p>It is still a race as to which will come first,
a social revolution in the West, or the political revolution in
the East. Either would have a tremendous social effect on the
other. A victory for the workers in any important country of the
West would sound the death knell of the bureaucracy in the whole
of Eastern Europe and in Russia. This in turn would lead very
rapidly to a collapse of the bureaucracy in China and the other
countries of proletarian Bonapartism.</p>


<p>On the other hand, political revolutions in the
East would restore the methods and ideas of the revolution - of
workers' democracy - as in the days of Lenin and Trotsky. All
that would flow as a consequence both in social and political
terms would have a cataclysmic effect on the countries of the
West. A political revolution in Russia or in Eastern Europe would
rapidly spread.</p>


<p>That is one of the reasons for the <em>detente </em>between
American imperialism and the Russian bureaucracy. The military
situation is one where there is a virtual stalemate in nuclear
arms. As far as conventional weapons are concerned, the Russian
bureaucracy has an overwhelming superiority.</p>


<p>In these circumstances, the fears shared by the
bureaucracy and the bourgeoisie for their continued existence in
the face of political revolution in the East and social
revolution in the West, create a common basis for agreement and <em>detente
</em>between the powers.</p>


<p>In Eastern Europe and in Russia the bureaucracy
has succeeded to a certain extent in erasing the traditions and
the social achievements of the revolution of the first period of
1917-23 with an overlay of bureaucratic excrescence. Because of
the weakness of Marxism in the West, and because of the purges
and the massacre of an entire generation of revolutionaries in
Russia and the long period of five or six decades of
bureaucratic, totalitarian misrule, it will require events
themselves to re-educate the masses. Explosions are inevitable in
Russia and in Eastern Europe in the period that lies ahead. What
we saw in Hungary in 1956 will be repeated in Russia and the
other countries of Eastern Europe.</p>


<p>Capitalism and Stalinism have before them a
period of prolonged death agony, the accumulation of
contradictions within Eastern Europe and Russia will result in
outbursts and explosions. There will be a quantative change into
qualitatively different movements of the masses.</p>


<p>The very weakness of capitalism has meant it
has not been possible to maintain authoritarian or totalitarian
regimes anywhere in Western Europe. This is not because the
bourgeoisie has been converted to democracy. As events have
demonstrated they can switch from totalitarian regime and back
again to 'democracy', so long as their rule is preserved. The
decay of capitalism and the difficulty of holding down the masses
in any other way except through deceit and parliamentary methods
of deception, lies and distortion indicates their weakness.
However we must not be caught by surprise by events in the East
or in the West. 1968 in France was not at all accidental, but was
an indication of the processes that will take place.</p>


<p>In one country after another, the masses will
take the road of struggle: in Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Sweden, or any of the smaller countries of capitalism. The United
States and Japan also cannot escape from the new period which is
opening up. This is the outlook for the developed countries of
the capitalist West and also the developed Stalinist totalitarian
states. But the upheavals and social explosions that have taken
place even in the last three decades, in particular in the
underdeveloped countries, are a pale foreshadowing of the future
movements in these countries.</p>


<p>One of the reasons for the rise of productive
forces in the West and the increases in the standards of living
has been the exploitation of the colonial people in the post-war
period. The EEC, Japan, the United States and the other
industrialised capitalist powers have organised the collective
exploitation of the colonial peoples. This is not directly by
military domination but by economic domination. Due to the
unfavourable terms of trade for the underdeveloped countries, the
prices of food and raw materials have not increased to the same
extent as the price of industrial goods and capital goods.</p>


<p>There has been a super-exploitation of the
colonial peoples. Whereas up to the recession of 1975, the
standards of living in the West had generally increased, the
two-thirds living in the underdeveloped world have experienced an
absolute fall in living standards, apart from a few exceptions.
There has been a very partial development of industry, uneven at
that, in certain countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Taiwan,
South Korea, Nigeria, India and other countries of Africa, Asia
and Latin America. But the very partial development of industry
in its turn has increased the strength of the working class. This
increase in industry creates new problems for the hundreds of
millions of under-employed, unemployed and pauperised peasants of
Africa, Asia and Latin America. There has been a gigantic
increase in landless, jobless and shelterless peasants streaming
to the slums around the cities. This in turn has increased the
contradictions in each country. All are entirely dependent on
world markets and dependent economically on the big imperialist
powers.</p>


<p>The whole of the post-war period has been rent
with explosion and upheaval in Asia, in Africa and Latin America.
The economic basis for this is the impossiblity of developing
productive forces harmoniously and at a high rhythm when
imperialism dominates these areas. The economic upswing between
1950 and 1975, provided the most favourable conditions that could
be expected under capitalism in the underdeveloped countries.
Because this led to stunted and limited growth of productive
forces and low living standards in these countries we have had
the biggest period of upheaval in the history of mankind in Asia,
Africa and Latin America.</p>


<p>Now that the economic upswing is at an end and
capitalism will move in a cycle of small booms and of small
slumps following each other, imperialism will attempt to load the
burdens of capitalist crisis on the underdeveloped world. Then
the conditions of the colonial masses will become much worse. At
their expense, the big powers will attempt to solve the
contradictions of their system. The increase in the price of oil
has been passed on to the non-oil or underdeveloped countries. In
addition, they will have to pay more for the products of industry
and capital goods. That means that the development of productive
forces, even to the extent of 1947-75 in a number of countries,
cannot take place, at least at the same pace. Already in the
post-1975 period there has been a fall in the rate of increase of
industrial development and production in the underdeveloped world
mirroring the process taking place in the industrialised
countries. Industrial development looks to export markets in the
West because of the weak home markets and the poverty of the
masses. Meanwhile the ruin and impoverishment of the peasant
masses is intensified.</p>


<p>The crisis of capitalism bears down more
harshly on the underdeveloped world than on the capitalist
countries. This in its turn is preparing greater explosions and
new movements in the 'Third World'. In the front line will be
Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia, Nigeria, Ghana. What we have seen
in the Central American republic of Nicaragua can tomorrow be
repeated not only in Central America, but especially in the
countries where bourgeois military police Bonapartist regimes
have been established. These dictatorships were engineered when
the ruling class found itself in a cul-de-sac, and yet this was
the most favourable period economically that could be expected as
long as market forces dominate.</p>


<p>Now with the crisis that is developing in the
industrialised world, the problems will bear even more harshly on
the peoples of the underdeveloped world. This sets the stage for
revolution in all the three continents concerned.</p>


<p>In Latin America and in some parts of Asia such
as Pakistan we have seen swings by the ruling class from one
regime to another, from democracy to dictatorship and back again
in the endeavour to escape from the contradictions with which
they are faced. In every case - either of dictatorship or uneasy
'democracy' they have failed to stabilise the social and economic
situation.</p>


<p>In India we saw the collapse of the
semi-Bonapartist government of Mrs Gandhi. Now the Janata Party -
a rag-bag coalition of differing elements - has fallen to pieces
as a consequence of the instability of the situation that exists.
India will take its place with Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia,
Nigeria and the other main countries of the underdeveloped world
as being an unstable country. This will prepare the way for big
social explosions.</p>


<p>In the case of such countries as India, unless
there is a socialist revolution, then it is possible that there
will be a break-up and 'Balkanisation'. (This can come after a
period of military-police dictatorship. Pakistan was an earlier
example of such a process).</p>


<p>Africa is Balkanised. Latin America is
Balkanised. Even the Indian sub-continent can find itself in the
same position unless Marxism finds the road to the working class.
On the road of capitalism there is no way out. As a consequence
of the impasse of the system there will be movements of tens and
hundreds of millions of peasants and of the working class.</p>


<p>In the underdeveloped countries, as in the
developed world, events will not proceed in a straight line.
There will be ups and downs of the economy which will be followed
by movements of the masses, not necessarily in consonance. In the
underdeveloped countries, more than any other area the
capitalists are absolutely incapable of developing productive
forces except to a very limited extent. As in the Western
capitalist countries, the improvements in the economy which will
take place from time to time can only encourage the masses and
the demands of the working class in particular.</p>


<p>Private ownership and landlordism and
capitalism are utterly incapable of playing a consistently
progressive role under the modern conditions of imperialism in
the underdeveloped world. The psychology of the masses,
particularly in the underdeveloped world, is changing. The
perplexity of the bourgeoisie and the failure of the ruling class
to show a way forward for society, has revolutionary consequences
in colonial countries. There the bourgeoisie is utterly incapable
of playing the role which was played by the bourgeoisie in the
West in the past. The paralysis of the bourgeoisie will be
reflected in the anger of the masses.</p>


<p>The blind alley that imperialism and
semi-feudal, semi-landlord capitalist states find themselves in
has been responsible for the revolution in Iran and the
revolution in Ethiopia. A new period is opening up, when there
will be one convulsion after another in the economically backward
continents of the world.</p>


<p>Marxism must find a way of reaching the masses,
particularly in countries that have a developed labour and trade
union movement. Only on this road can there be a healthy
development of the revolution. Such a possibility existed in the
Chinese revolution of 1925-7 when the working class was the
spearhead and the dominant force in the revolution.</p>


<p>In India, Argentina, Brazil, Nigeria and, in
fact, in most of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America
there is now a numerically important proletariat which is even
more decisive in its social weight in society. It could play the
role of rallying the mass of the nation if it had the necessary
leadership and gained the necessary understanding. <em>The
subjective factor is decisive.</em></p>


<p>It is only the impasse of capitalism in the
colonial countries that has resulted in the development of
proletarian Bonapartist, totalitarian states such as in China,
Ethiopia, and other countries. They partially solved the
problems, in the sense that landlordism and capitalism are
eliminated. But they pave the way for a new revolution - a
political revolution - without which the masses could not even
begin the construction of socialism or establish a healthy
workers' democracy. A political revolution is necessary in these
states for the control of industry, the state and the whole of
society to pass into the hands of the workers and peasants.</p>
