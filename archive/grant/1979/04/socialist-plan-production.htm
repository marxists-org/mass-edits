   <p>The Tories have declared war on the organized working class in their  Manifesto. Despite speeches about &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; and all the other smooth  talk, the measures they propose are a declaration of class war, a  twisted echoing of Heath&rsquo;s Industrial Relations Act.</p>

   <p>The cardboard lady Mrs Thatcher has adopted her &lsquo;Iron Maiden&rsquo; pose  [reflecting her big business paymasters] to &ldquo;Cut down&rdquo; the power of the  trade unions and &ldquo;Restore the balance between the Trade Unions and the  Employers&rdquo;. </p>

   <p class="quote">&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be shouted from the Hustings&rdquo;, says the &lsquo;Economist&rsquo;, right  wing organ of big business &ldquo;but Britain needs a swing from wages to  profits to help regenerate industry. Britain&rsquo;s underlying growth rate  is now so low that getting higher profits may need a cut&mdash;not just  slower growth&mdash;in real wages&rdquo;. (7/4/79) </p>

   <p>That is the background to the Tories&rsquo; policies, and the media&rsquo;s poisonous campaign against the unions.</p>

   <p>The unions are the shield of the organised working class, protecting rights, conditions and living standards. </p>

   <p>Through pressure to defend and improve the social wage; pensions,  hospital services, housing, social services and transport, they fight  for the interests of all workers.</p>

   <p>All the rights of working people including the right to vote,  organise and strike; free speech and free press were won by struggles  of the labour movement.</p>

   <p>The real Tory programme is one of holding down wages; allowing  prices to rise, and further slashing government spending. The CBI has  called for another &pound;6,000 million cut.</p>

   <p><em>In five years, arms expenditure has increased from &pound;3, 600 million to &pound;8, 500 million.</em></p>

   <p>This programme is bitter class war. The Tories want to deepen the  present gulf between the health, housing, and other amenities of the  capitalists and those of the workers. Private health schemes and  subsidies for private schools are encouraged. These are all out of the  reach of workers, who must suffer cuts in already inadequate services.</p>

   <p>Pennies from income tax concessions to low income families will be  more than cancelled by increased food prices through increasing VAT on  necessities such as furniture. But cuts in tax will mean that &lsquo;at a  stroke&rsquo; the weekly income of top directors and managers will rise <em>by more than the average industrial worker earns in 6 months</em>.</p>

   <p>Meanwhile, arms expenditure will rise. British capitalism is  obsessed with &lsquo;arms&rsquo;, with spending more than doubled in five years, at  a time when their Japanese rivals spend less than 1% of GNP on  &lsquo;defence&rsquo;.</p>

   <p>The Japanese ruling class have ploughed back the surplus extracted  from the labour of the working class into industry, one of the reasons  for their out-stripping all their capitalist rivals except for the  United States.</p>

   <p>Without a powerful industrial base, armaments do not increase the  military strength of a country. Quite the reverse. Yet the Tories, and  unfortunately under pressure, the Labour leaders too, have increased  the production of what amounts to scrap metal, rapidly obsolescent arms.</p>

   <p> This will neither frighten the Russian bureaucracy (who treat  British capitalism with open contempt) nor assist the standing of  capitalist Britain with her allies.</p>

   <p>Why then this crazy stockpiling? Merely a frenetic attempt to  restore the long gone power of the pre-war days when Britain was second  only to the USA as a world force. But now Britain is regarded as a poor  country by her rivals: twentieth in the league of industrialised  nations. &ldquo;Defence&rdquo; and &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; would be the only exceptions to  Tory cuts.</p>

   <p>But the Tories&rsquo; determination to drive down workers&rsquo; living  standards and to increase big business profits is not a personal whim  of Thatcher and Joseph. It is caused by the economic crisis of British  capitalism which has polarised class society into two fundamental  camps, the workers and the capitalists.</p>

   <p>It is false for the right wing social-democrats or even Tribunites  to weep at the &lsquo;unfair&rsquo; attitudes of the Tories. Their programme is  dictated by the economic impasse of capitalism. The failure of  Keynesianism leading to inflation has led to attempts to return to  orthodox methods of deflation of the past. Neither will help workers.</p>

   <p>But to carry out such a policy the Tories have to weaken workers&rsquo;  resistance and try to undermine their defence&mdash;the unions. Even after  the experience of the Heath government the capitalists need to return  to economic and social confrontation. On the road of capitalism there  is no alternative.</p>

   <p>In 1979 in Britain, only one worker in three is employed in  manufacturing industry. Sir Adrian Cadbury, the chocolate boss has  projected that it will shortly be one in five. In the last fifteen  years 1.5 million manufacturing jobs have been lost in Britain.</p>

   <p>But the number employed in West Germany, France, Japan and Italy has  increased by more than a million over the last ten years. That process  has begun to seize up in those countries too as a consequence of the  organic crisis of world capitalism. But within this world crisis is the  special crisis of British capitalism.</p>

   <p>In the past the only argument for capitalism was that in their greed  for gain, capitalist reinvestment in industry increased the wealth of  society. But in Britain the capitalists invest in unproductive  money-spinners like land.</p>

   <p>The failure to invest in the production of real wealth, i.e.  manufacturing industry, and in particular machinery and equipment for  production means that Britain is falling further and further behind her  rivals. Despite higher subsidies which pay for half of all  manufacturing investment it is increasing at a snail&rsquo;s pace.</p>

   <p>The capitalists invest in land, property speculation, tourism, stock  exchange speculation, advertising, service industries, casinos, horse  racing, antiques, painting and jewellery, anything but in manufacturing  industry. </p>

   <p>In 1976 they invested over &pound;2,000 million abroad. Now the City of  London wants Mrs Thatcher to open the floodgates by abolishing the  dollar premium on investment abroad.</p>

   <p>So, despite the sacrifices of the last five years the working class  in Britain has the lowest wages of any capitalist industrialised  country. Only by exploiting cheap labour can British capitalists  compete in world markets; but in today&rsquo;s world, cheap labour is not  enough.</p>

   <p>In productivity of steel Britain has been outclassed. Now, due to  massive investment, Japan produces 45 cars in the time it takes workers  in British factories to produce 7. Of all the radios sold in Britain, a  mere 4% are made in this country,&mdash;and exports are negligible!</p>

   <p>Britain 20 years ago had 98% of the world market of motor bikes.  They now have 2% of the. British market! Half of the cars, televisions,  fridges, vacuum cleaners and washing machines sold in Britain are  imported. 25% of all manufactured and even more semi-manufactured goods  are imports.</p>

   <p>And British manufacturers&rsquo; share of markets at home and abroad  continues to fall. Denis Healey has pointed out that &ldquo;in 1979  manufacturing will be unable to stand up sufficiently to competition  either in home or export markets.&rdquo; The Treasury forecast greater import  penetration and a deterioration in the volume of trade in manufactured  goods. Healey has also estimated that manufacturing exports would rise  by only 7% while imports rose 14%.</p>

   <p>In the vital sphere of machine tools, British capitalism is also  losing ground. Imports of agricultural machinery (expensive  sophisticated technical equipment) has risen 197% in ten years. Exports  have grown by only 31%. Investment in the machine tool industry has  fallen sharply in real terms since 1970, particularly in new building.</p>

   <p>In 1970 &pound;18.6m of plant and machinery was manufactured; by 1977,  this had declined to &pound;17m. The amount of new building collapsed from  &pound;5.2m to &pound;2.2m (all at constant 1975 prices).</p>

   <p>British capitalism is being defeated on both home and international  markets because of failure to invest in manufacturing industry. There  is a contradiction between finance and industrial capital. Service  industries are more profitable.</p>

   <p>The &lsquo;Economist&rsquo; again points out &ldquo;without a revival in  profitability, why should the average British company invest more? In  1976, it was making 16.8% on capital measured at historic costs,  compared with the 15% it could have got simply by depositing cash  risk-free with local authorities.&rdquo;</p>

   <p>Interest rates are so high that it does not pay the capitalists to  invest in machinery. They produce not for need, but for profit. The  contradictions of capitalism have so developed in Britain that the  essentials have been forgotten&mdash;real wealth is manufacturing wealth.</p>

   <h4>Counter-reforms</h4>
   <p>Reforms promised by Labour, which we support, could not be carried  out on a capitalist basis. Capitalism must press for counter-reforms:  wage cuts and slashed services, i.e. the Tory programme. At this moment  big business do not want a Labour government.</p>

   <p>This crisis poses a nightmare future for the real producers of  wealth, the working class. Britain remains potentially an enormously  wealthy country, but only if the resources of society are taken over by  the working class.</p>

   <p>The nationalisation of the banks and insurance companies and the 200  monopolies controlling 85% of the wealth of the country (with minimum  compensation on the basis of need) is indispensable to release  productive forces from the fetters which bind them.</p>

   <p>Planning production would mean the maximum production of goods to  benefit working people, and the absorbing of the unemployed into  productive work. The &pound;4,000m paid out in dole could be used for social  purposes. Used in productive industry the unemployed could produce  &pound;20,000m extra wealth. &pound;20 a week for every family!</p>

   <p>Only about 80% of productive capacity is now in use&mdash; because of the  limits of the market. 20% more goods could be produced by this alone  with a socialist plan of production. In addition a democratic plan of  production would entail workers&rsquo; control of management of industry and  the state.</p>

   <p>Without the fear of redundancy if they produced more, the workers  would respond with invention, initiative, elan and enthusiasm. A growth  rate of 20% a year would be possible.</p>

   <p>A socialist Britain could begin with at least &pound;70 a week for every  family, including pensioners, widows and the sick. Skill and technique  would be used to the maximum extent. Within a few years Britain&rsquo;s  factories could be completely reequipped.</p>

   <p>At most a 35-hour week would be worked, while rapidly a 4- or 5-hour  day with a 4-day week could be introduced. This would allow the  involvement of the whole population in politics, and give the working  class the necessary time to run industry and state. </p>

   <p>The new techniques of computers and micro-electronics would make  this entirely possible. Under capitalism, though, they would merely put  further millions out of work.</p>

   <p>Professor Curnow of Sussex University predicts that on introduction  of micro-computers, &ldquo;The first jobs to go will be in the office and  light assembly work in factories, mostly carried out now by working  housewives.&rdquo; &ldquo;The typist, secretary, lower white collar management man  will become redundant,&rdquo; he says confidently (&lsquo;Daily Express&rsquo;, 8.12.78).</p>

   <p>Professor Stonier of Bradford University predicts that 90% of  manufacturing jobs will be abolished by the silicon chip in 30  years.&rdquo;10% of the population will provide all the material things we  need,&rdquo; predicts the professor.</p>

   <p><em>New technology will mean unemployment under capitalism, but leisure and plenty with a planned economy.</em></p>

   <p class="quote">&ldquo;The basic week will be four days of 5 hours a day, and people will  be moving back into the education system for the whole of their lives.&rdquo;</p>

   <p>This would be impossible under capitalism. But in a democratic socialist Britain, it could be achieved in 3, not 30 years.</p>

   <p>Such a state would be a beacon to workers of Europe and the world. A  socialist appeal by British workers would be followed by the collapse  of capitalism in Western Europe and the fall of Stalinism in Eastern  Europe. Internationalist policies and a socialist United States of  Europe and the world would lead to the scrapping of the lunacy of arms  production.</p>

   <p>&pound;1,000,000,000,000 is wasted throughout the world every four years  on arms. The greater part of the world&rsquo;s scientific resources is spent  on preparing ever more devilish instruments of destruction. Used  constructively, all these resources could abolish poverty and disease,  racialism and war. It would mean the complete transformation of mankind.</p>
