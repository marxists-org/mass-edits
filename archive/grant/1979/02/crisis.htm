<p class="fst">Many
workers must be surprised at the fury and the hysterical bayings of
the press, TV and radio against the organised workers in the unions.
</p>
<p>
This
has been orchestrated by the CBI, the monopolies, the Tories and the
Liberals. To their shame, many right-wing Labour leaders have joined
in this hyena chorus of capitalism.
</p>
<p>
This outbreak of capitalist mental
sickness has been caused by the strikes of the railwaymen, lorry
drivers and council workers. But the utter cynicism and depravity of
the media, probably unequalled by the yellow press anywhere in the
world, are shown by the exposure in our paper of the lies distortions
and trumped-up cases of distress &ldquo;caused by strikes&rdquo;,
particularly concerning the low-paid public service workers.
</p>
<p>
Not
a word appears about the nightmare of living on wages inadequate to
cover rent, food, clothing and other essentials. Nothing is too vile
or too false to use to incite the middle class and backward layers
against workers fighting for a bearable civilised standard of living.
</p>
<p>
This
is the class struggle carried to an &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; by the
representatives of the monopoly millionaires. But it is the sickness
of capitalism not the severe winter conditions which has driven the
capitalists insane. There is method in their madness.
</p>
<p>
British
capitalism is losing ground year after year in the struggle for world
markets and even in its own home market.
</p>
<p>
There
have now been three years of belt-tightening and sacrifice by the
working class through the social contract and cuts in the &ldquo;social
wage&rdquo; (education, health, social services, transport).
</p>
<p>
The
Chancellor, Dennis Healey, boasted to the Institute of Directors that
Britain (i.e. British capitalism) had the <i>lowest
wages</i>
and the <i>biggest
subsidies</i>
to big business of any industrialised country in the world. In fact,
the working class have been reduced to the position of being the
&ldquo;coolies&rdquo; of Western Europe.
</p>
<p>
On
the other hand, the social contract resulted in a bonanza of profits
for big business. In 1976 profits shot up to &pound;7,408 million after
allowing for stock appreciation, an increase of 28.9% in comparison
with the previous years. In 1977 they further increased to &pound;10,767
million, up by 45.3% over the previous year.
</p>
<p>
In
the first nine months of 1978, profits amounted to &pound;9,498 million,
an average increase of 21% on the first nine months of 1977.
</p>
<p>
But
the figures for investment did not go up. In fact, between 1975 and
1976 the amount invested in manufacturing industry actually fell from
&pound;3,522 million to &pound;3,345 million. In 1977 there was a small
increase to &pound;3,513 million and in 1978 to &pound;3,860m (all at 1975
prices). None of these figures though reaches the investment level of
1970 (4,196 million).
</p>
<p>
British
capitalist industry has become monopolised and parasitic. The
capitalists are short-sightedly grasping at the most immediately
profitable investment. Thus they invest enormous sums abroad; in
service trades; exploited industries like catering; in property
speculation, Stock Exchange gambling, tourism and land. Anything but
productive industry.
</p>
<p>
The
amount invested in 1970 (in 1975 prices) in the service trades was
&pound;3,669 million. By 1978 it had reached &pound;4,690 million, <i>far
in excess of that in manufacturing</i>.
The estimate for 1979 is &pound;4,920 million. This shows an increase of
over a third. That leaves out of account vast sums invested outside
Britain. In consequence, British capitalism (in the words of an
article tucked away in <i>The
Times</i>
business columns) is in &ldquo;irreversible decline.&rdquo;
</p>
<h4>Competitiveness</h4>
<p class="fst">
Chancellor
Healey, thundering against the workers for breaking the 5% limit,
does not take the same stern attitude towards the capitalists. He
accepts the crisis of capitalism and tries to unload the burdens on
to the backs of the working class.
</p>
<p>
But
the failure to invest means that British capitalism cannot compete on
home and foreign markets.
</p>
<p>
The
steel industry&rsquo;s plight is indicative of the general position of
British capitalism. One German worker produces as much as three
British workers. One Japanese worker produces as much as three German
workers. So nine British workers produce only as much as one Japanese
steelworker, not because Japanese or German workers work harder, but
because more is invested there in modern industry.
</p>
<p>
It
is estimated that this year 54% of cars sold on the British market
will be of foreign make. Britain has dropped from second place in the
production of cars to sixth or seventh.
</p>
<p>
Despite
greater profits than their rivals in the past (and even now) the
British capitalists have failed, even under the most favourable
conditions of wage restraint to use the surplus extracted from the
labour of the working class to invest adequately in manufacturing
industry.
</p>
<p>
The
<i>Financial
Times</i>,
the journal of big business, of
December 17 1978 quotes Chancellor Denis Healey as saying to a TUC
strategy conference in Birmingham: &ldquo;The reason why Britain&rsquo;s rate
of economic growth is expected to fall off next year is because
industry will be unable to stand up sufficiently to competition
either in home or export markets.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Manufacturing
and semi-manufacturing imports increased by 14% in 1978.
Manufacturing and semi-manufacturing exports only by 7%. We have the
frank words of Dennis Healey that in 1979 the position will be even
worse.
</p>
<p>
For
him there is no question of screaming at the CBI and the capitalists
for &ldquo;letting down the country&rdquo;. On the contrary his strictures
are against the low-paid working class victims of the social
contract.
</p>
<p>
As
Britain&rsquo;s decline continues, no doubt the right-wing Labour leaders
together with the press, CBI and Liberals will blame the disastrous
situation on the workers. The working class has the temerity to fight
to regain living standards lost over the last four years of
&ldquo;austerity&rdquo;!
</p>
<p>
But
as a result of the capitalist crisis, the workers are on a treadmill.
The monopolies will try to cancel out wage increases by raising
prices despite the problems of world competition. Failing to succeed
in this way they will exert pressure on the government or engineer a
devaluation by provoking panic on the foreign exchange markets.
</p>
<h4>Inflation</h4>
<p class="fst">
This
debasing of the currency &ldquo;at a stroke&rdquo; will wipe out the gains of
the Herculean and heroic struggles of the workers to regain living
standards. Then the reactionary media will glibly trumpet out that
higher wages have caused inflation.
</p>
<p>
But
inflation will be caused by higher prices for the food, raw materials
and manufactured goods imported. This is because the pound&rsquo;s
&ldquo;value&rdquo; will fall in relation to other currencies.
</p>
<p>
In any event, prices of food and raw
materials, as well as manufactured goods on world markets are
increasing, inevitably giving a twist to the inflationary spiral.
</p>
<p>
However,
after their previous painful experiences of devaluation, one of the
main causes of inflation, the ruling class will only turn to this
drug reluctantly. It requires bigger and bigger doses to have the
same effect. On the road of devaluation there is only a dead end.
</p>
<p>
But
the &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; of incomes policy, which means squeezing out a
greater surplus from the labour of the working class, has been tried
since 1948 by successive Tory and Labour governments. When the
workers have seen that it is just a racket to increase the share of
the employers at the expense of the working class, they have
inevitably resisted and the policy has broken down.
</p>
<p>
The
policies of reformism, of gradually reforming capitalism, have been
shown to be bankrupt. We have consequently had from the Labour
government the adoption of vicious Tory policies. They abandoned the
policy of increasing state expenditure (except for arms), and adopted
the policy of slashing cuts.
</p>
<p>
The
renegade Prentice, now a Tory candidate for Parliament, has blurted
out that there are at least four Cabinet Ministers and dozens of
Labour MPs who agree with him and his Tory policies.
</p>
<p>
This
is because many of the middle and upper class Labour MPs live no
differently from their Tory peers.
</p>
<p>
They
believe in capitalism, the so-called &ldquo;mixed economy&rdquo;, and
therefore are prepared to hold down the living standards of the
workers in order to bail out the system.
</p>
<p>
Consequently
the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party are forced into the
position of openly advocating strike-breaking; of crossing picket
lines to try to defeat workers struggling for wage increases. But it
was Trotsky who wrote that nobody can break the will of the working
class to transform society.
</p>
<p>
It
is because they can see no other course than trying to prop up
diseased capitalism that the right-wing reformists behave in this
way. Not prepared to &ldquo;take on&rdquo; big business they are forced to
&ldquo;take on&rdquo; the working class.
</p>
<p>
On
the basis of accepting the capitalist system, without fundamental
changes, there is a crazy logic in this position. It is the needs of
the economic system which forces them to the position of
counter-reformism.
</p>
<p>
Neither
inflation nor deflation can serve the interests of the working class.
Of course <i>Militant</i>,
as a Marxist paper, supports increasing vitally necessary state
expenditure on social services. It supports every struggle for wage
increases. But when there is a fundamental crisis of capitalism these
gains are cancelled out.
</p>
<h4>Transformation</h4>
<p class="fst">
There
is no enduring solution to the problems facing the working class
under capitalism. But in the struggle for higher wages and better
conditions and hours the workers will come to recognise the need for
a fighting socialist programme and the transformation of both the
Labour Party and the trade unions. It is necessary to make Clause IV
of the Labour Party constitution a living reality.
</p>
<p>
The
programme of <i>Militant</i>
will become the programme of the working class and the labour
movement. There is no other course for the working class if they are
not to face catastrophe. It is impossible to plan capitalism. The
national and world markets are dominant in this system.
</p>
<p>
The
labour and trade union movement must break with capitalism. Labour
must be committed to introduce an Enabling Act to break the power of
capital. The House of Lords and the Monarchy, both of them reserve
weapons of capitalism, must be abolished. The banks and insurance
companies plus the 200 monopolies which control 85 % of the wealth
must be nationalised with compensation only on the basis of proven
need.
</p>
<p>
By
mobilising the trade union and labour movement to carry this
programme out we can ensure workers&rsquo; control and management of
industry and the state.
</p>
<p>
A
plan of production would rapidly modernise British industry to
produce an abundance of goods for all. A monopoly of foreign trade by
the state would regulate Britain&rsquo;s world trade.
</p>
<p>
One
and a half million unemployed are compelled to rot in idleness.
Capitalist economists themselves have pointed out that given
productive work in industry they could produce at least &pound;15,000
million of wealth. That is &pound;20 per week for every family in Britain.
</p>
<p>
At
the moment they are paid &pound;4,000 million to do nothing. That alone
amounts to nearly &pound;6 a week for every family if they were back at
work. This does not take into account the enormous increase in
production that would follow once the workers take over society.
</p>
<p>
A
&pound;70 minimum standard for all including the old age pensioners,
widows, the sick and the disabled with a 30-hour week would be
entirely possible in a socialist Britain.
