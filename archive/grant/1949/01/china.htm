      </p>        <hr /><p class="fst">With the spectacular advance of the Chinese Red Army, the diplomats of the   State Department in America and the Foreign Office in Britain are seriously   discussing the possibility of the complete collapse of the Chiang Kai Shek regime.   The entire capitalist press writes gloomily of the prospect of North and Central   China to the Yangtse coming under Stalinist sway.</p><p>Within three years of the collapse of Japanese imperialism, the Red Army has   conquered Manchuria and most of North China. The Chinese capital Nanking, with   the richest city of China, Shanghai, which has a population of five million,   are rapidly coming within the grasp of the Red Army. The territory which the   Stalinists already dominate has a population of more than 170 million.</p><p>The British capitalists, with investments in China amounting to &#163;450 million,   are dismayed at the prospect of the loss of this lucrative field of investment.   American imperialism, within whose sphere of influence China fell with the weakening   of the other imperialist powers during the war, has given the Kuomintang government   aid to the extent of &#36;3 billion, in a fruitless attempt to save China for imperialist   exploitation.</p><p>But the American imperialists now realise that further aid is merely throwing   away good money after bad. With all the military and technical advantages in   its favour in the early stages of the civil war that followed the world war,   the Kuomintang has suffered defeat after defeat. The Kuomintang regime, under   the dictatorial rule of Chiang Kai Shek, represents the feudal landlords and   capitalists. It is controlled by an utterly corrupt military clique which oppresses   the workers and peasants and battens on their masters.</p><!-- begin not in TUT -->
<h4>Chiang&#8217;s rise</h4>
<!-- end not in TUT --><p class="fst">Chiang Kai Shek came to power after the defeat of the Chinese revolution of   1925-7 in which he played the role of chief butcher of the working class. He   succeeded in this because of the policy of Stalin and Bukharin and the leadership   of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

<p>Their policy then was to form a bloc with the   Chinese landlords, capitalists and feudal warlords, allegedly in the interests   of the struggle against imperialism. In consequence, they sabotaged the attempts   of the workers to take over the factories and the peasants to take the land.   A &#8220;communist&#8221; Minister of Labour sabotaged strikes and punished striking workers.   A &#8220;communist&#8221; Minister of Agriculture had peasants shot down when they attempted   to seize the land.</p><!-- begin not in TUT -->
<h4>A Sympathising Section</h4>
<!-- end not in TUT -->
<p class="fst">The capitalist Kuomintang was taken into the Communist international as a sympathising   section. In <em>The Third International After Lenin</em> by Trotsky, the Stalinists&#8217;   role is shown in an explanatory note:</p><p class="quote">&#8220;The Kuomintang was admitted to the Comintern as a sympathising party   early in 1926, approved by the Politbureau of the C.P.S.U., with the sole dissenting   vote of Trotsky. Hu Han-min, right-wing Kuomintang leader, participated in the   Sixth Plenum of the E.C.C.I., February, 1926, as a fraternal delegate from the Kuomintang.   Shao Ki-tze a henchman of Chiang Kai Shek, was fraternal delegate to the Seventh   Plenum, E.C.C.I., November, 1926 (<em>Minutes</em> German edition, pp. 403f.)&#8221;   (London edition, 1936)</p><p class="fst">On March 21<sup>st</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1927, the workers of Shanghai captured the city. Chiang immediately began preparations to butcher them. He conspired with the imperialists   to crush the workers.</p><p>Instead of preparing for the struggle the Stalinists gave full support to Chiang.   The Comintern official journal <em>International Press Correspondence, </em>French   edition, March 23<sup>rd</sup>, 1927, page 443, said: &#8220;Far from dividing, as the imperialists   say, the Kuomintang has only steeled its ranks.&#8221;</p><p>On March 30<sup>th</sup> they wrote:</p><p class="quote">&#8220;A split in the Kuomintang and hostilities between the Shanghai proletariat   and the revolutionary soldiers are absolutely excluded for the moment&#8230;Chiang   Kai Shek&#8230;himself declared that he would submit to the decisions of the party&#8230;A   revolutionist like Chiang Kai Shek will not go over, as the imperialists would   like to have it believed, to Chang Tso-lin <!-- begin not in TUT - in TUT was Chang Tao-lin--><!-- end not in TUT -->(the Northern militarist) to fight   against the emancipation movement&#8230;&#8221;</p><p class="fst">Chiang proceeded to organise a coup, massacre the flower of the workers, illegalise   the trade unions, the peasant organisations, the Communist Party, and deprive   the masses of all rights.</p><p>The masses were utterly defeated and the remnants of the Chinese leadership   of the Communist Party fled to the peasant areas&mdash;and there tried to organise   a peasant war.</p><h4>Peasant army <!-- begin not in TUT -->held out<!-- end not in TUT --></h4><p class="fst">The guerrilla struggle threw up leaders of remarkable military genius. Mao   Tse Tung, Chu The<sup class="ednote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup> and others succeeded in evading the powerful military forces   which the Kuomintang had arrayed against them.</p>

<p>Despite the false political line   which led to successive disasters, in one of the most remarkable military feats   in world history, Mao was driven from Central and South China in a 6,000-mile   retreat to the mountain fastnesses around Yenan, where a &#8220;soviet&#8221; republic was   set up. There, despite all the efforts of the Chiang regime to dislodge them,   they succeeded in holding out against one attack after another. The secret of   their success was that the land had been divided among the peasants in this   small area, comprising, according to some estimates, about 10 million population.</p><!-- begin not in TUT -->
<h4>Corrupt Chiang regime</h4>
<!-- end not in TUT -->
<p class="fst">In the intervening period between the wars, the Chiang regime piled up ever   increasing burdens on the workers and peasants. In some areas the taxes were   collected from the peasants by the corrupt local officials <em>80 years in advance.</em></p><p>There was an endless militaristic squandering of wealth, and the feeble Kuomintang   regime showed itself incapable of waging a revolutionary struggle against the   incursions of imperialistic Japan.</p><p>The Chiang regime resolved itself into one of bribery and police terror. In   a period of two decades it became so completely degenerate from top to bottom   that it had lost most of its support even among the middle class.</p><!-- begin not in TUT -->
<h4>War changed situation</h4>
<!-- end not in TUT -->
<p class="fst">After the collapse of Japan, with a certain aid from the Red Army in Manchuria   which helped the Stalinists to capture Japanese munitions, large parts of Manchuria   and the North fell into the hands of the Stalinists.</p>

<p>The Chinese Red Army had   waged a guerrilla struggle against Japanese militarism throughout the war and   were in a strategic position to seize certain areas with the Japanese collapse.   Even throughout the war Chiang&#8217;s main preoccupation was the social danger at   home, to deal with the Stalinists and workers, and had it not been clear that   Japan was going to be defeated in the later stages, it is quite likely that   he would have capitulated and made a compromise with Japanese imperialism.</p><h4>A Dying Regime</h4><p class="fst">American imperialism assisted Chiang by pouring in munitions and other supplies,   and even direct military intervention in the transport of Kuomintang troops   to Manchuria and North China by the U.S. fleet and air force. Chiang had initial   successes, but all in vain. He was leading a dying regime, more archaic than   even the Czarist regime in Russia. So rotten was the regime that large parts   of the supplies were <em>sold </em>by officials to the Stalinist armies for gold,   and ministers and other officials in Chiang&#8217;s government pocketed a great part   of the dollars supplied for the war by America. Only the lesser part of the   supplies and munitions actually reached the Nationalist troops at the front.</p><p>The military commanders ceaselessly intrigued against one another, as in all   doomed regimes. Chiang, for example, starved General Fu Tso Yi, the only outstanding   general who showed any real capacity on the Nationalist side, of supplies, for   fear he might seek to replace him. The generals were outclassed by the superior   strategy and tactics of the Red Army command.</p><h4>Social Questions Involved</h4><p class="fst">However, the main reason for the victories of the Chinese Stalinists has been   readily pointed out by Mao Tse Tung: <em>the social questions involved. </em>&#8220;Land   to the peasants,&#8221; as in the Russian revolution, sounded the death knell of feudal   landowners and their corrupt regime. In large part, the Chinese Stalinists have   carried out the agrarian revolution. That is the significant difference between   the struggle in 1927 and now. It is this which has been responsible for the   melting away of the armies which Chiang tried to use to crush the agrarian rebellion.   Chiang&#8217;s armies are composed of peasants&mdash;the poorest peasants at that&mdash;who   have not enough money to escape conscription by bribing the officials.</p><!-- begin not in TUT -->
<h4>&#8220;Roped together&#8221;</h4>
<!-- end not in TUT -->
<p>Even the <em>News Chronicle </em>(11<sup>th</sup> December, 1948) admits:</p><p class="quote">&#8220;There is discontent among the rank and file of the Nationalist army. Chiang&#8217;s   privates get about five pence a month.</p><p class="quote">&#8220;In some villages conscripts are roped together on the way to barracks,   and when they travel by train carriage doors and wagons are locked so that they   cannot escape.&#8221;</p><p class="fst">Naturally, they desert with their arms, even to the extent of whole divisions   when confronted with the agrarian programme of the Stalinists.</p><h4>The Stalinist agrarian programme</h4><p class="fst">At the national agrarian conference of the Chinese Communist party held on   September 13<sup>th</sup>, 1947, it was proposed to carry through an agrarian law containing   the following provisions:</p><p class="quote">&#8220;Article 1. The agrarian system of feudal and semi-feudal exploitation   is abolished. The agrarian system of &#8216;land to the tiller&#8217; is to he established.</p><p class="quote">&#8220;Article 2. The land ownership rights of all landlords are abolished.</p><p class="quote">&#8220;Article 3. The land ownership rights of all ancestral shrines, temples,   monasteries, schools, institutions, and organisations, are abolished.</p><p class="quote">&#8220;Article 4. All debts incurred in the countryside prior to the reform   of the agrarian system are cancelled.&#8221;</p><p class="fst">Article 10, aimed directly at the soldiers and even the officers of the Kuomintang   reads, in part:</p><p class="quote">&#8220;Section c. All personnel of the People&#8217;s Liberation Armies, democratic   governments, and all peoples&#8217; organisations whose home is in the countryside   shall be given land and properties equivalent to that of peasants for themselves   and their families.</p><p class="quote">&#8220;Section d. Landlords and their families shall be given land and properties   equivalent to that of the peasants.</p><p class="quote">&#8220;Section e. Families of Kuomintang officers and soldiers, Kuomintang Party   members and other enemy personnel whose homes are in rural areas, shall he given   land and properties equivalent to that of the peasants.&#8221;</p>

<h4>Workers passive</h4>
<!-- end not in TUT --><p class="fst">One of the outstanding facts in the situation in China is the relative passivity   of the working class. It is true that as a result of the collapse of the   Chiang armies, there have been widespread strike struggles in the large cities,   Shanghai, Canton, Hankow and Nanking, despite the repressive conditions. However,   it is clear that as the Stalinists advance towards the big cities on the Yangtse,   the workers, for lack of a mass alternative, can only rally to their banner.   The workers never supported the Chiang Kai Shek regime.</p><p>Every socialist worker will wholeheartedly applaud the destruction of feudalism   and of large-scale capitalism in this important section of Asia, even though   it is carried out under the leadership of Stalinism. In its <em>long-term implications   </em>it is as important as the October revolution itself.</p>

<!-- begin not in TUT -->
<h4>How the capitalists see it</h4>
<!-- end not in TUT -->

<p class="fst">One could give no better   Marxist analysis of the gloomy picture for the world capitalist class than that   expressed in the editorial of <em>The Times, </em>10<sup>th</sup> November, 1948:</p><p class="quote">&#8220;At the best this spells only a single check (Hsuchow held by the Nationalists   at the time and since fallen) after months of gains which have swung the balance   of power&mdash;military, industrial, ideological&mdash;to the communist side. Their widening   hold on large areas of Northern and Central China has a much deeper meaning   than the Japanese invasion of ten years ago, for the communists&mdash;decisively   helped by Russia as they have been and Marxists as they remain&mdash;summon up and   organise native revolutionary forces. In its vastness and in its all too likely   consequences the present upheaval has rather to be compared with the Russian   revolution of 1917&mdash;from which it directly and obviously springs. Wider success   for the Chinese communists would offer wider influence, and at the ripe moment   wider success, for the power with which they ally themselves. Long-cherished   Soviet plans for swinging the backward millions of Asia into the camp which   already stretches from the Oder to Sakhalin would receive the greatest measure   of reinforcement so far.</p><p class="quote">&#8220;&#8230;They can draw upon the peasantry for their divisions, and they   have been able to win over the support of the peasantry by expropriating most   of the landlords and redistributing the land. So far the agricultural reforms   of the communists have prospered the more obviously because they have not had   to feed many large towns; the food has mainly been kept in the country areas.</p><p class="quote">&#8220;In some regions a commander has ruthlessly shot or imprisoned those whom   he has judged to be anti-communist; in others there has been a show of tolerance   with few changes in the traditional way of life. Businessmen and others have   even been given the choice of staying or leaving. This show of tolerance seems   to be the policy of Mao Tse Tung, the highly astute communist leader. His writings   and speeches show him to he an unshakeable Marxist, but one who recognises that   Marx&#8217;s analysis of the opportunities for revolution in the industrial Europe   of last century cannot be applied strictly to the mainly agricultural and primitive   state of much of China. He seems to have decided to reach his communist goal   by two stages. First, there is to be a system of relatively free trading, similar   to the New Economic Policy which Lenin introduced after the initial failure   of militant communism in Russia. It is this stage which he proclaims at present,   hoping, not without success&mdash;not only to win the peasants but to assuage the   fears of many townspeople. Secondly when the first stage has been accomplished,   he plans to make the further step to Marxist socialism.&#8221;</p><p class="fst">The references to Marxism and the communist policy of Mao are of course false.   The policy of Stalinism in Russia, in Eastern Europe and in China has been labelled   Marxist by all present day capitalist journalists. It is a perversion of Marxism.   Nevertheless <em>The Times </em>sees that the tactics of the Chinese Stalinists   will be similar to those of the Stalinists in Eastern Europe.</p><h4>Two sides of the coin</h4><p class="fst">While supporting the destruction of feudalism in China, it must be emphasised   that only a horrible caricature of the Marxist conception of the revolution   will result because of the leadership of the Stalinists. Not a real democracy,   but a totalitarian regime as brutal as that of Chiang Kai Shek will develop.   Like the regimes in Eastern Europe, Mao will look to Russia as his model. Undoubtedly,   tremendous economic progress will be achieved. But the masses, both workers   and peasants, will find themselves enslaved by the bureaucracy.</p><p>The Stalinists are incorporating into their regime ex-feudal militarists, capitalist   elements, and the bureaucratic officialdom in the towns who will occupy positions   of privilege and power.</p><p>On the basis of such a backward economy, a large scale differentiation among   the peasants (as after the Russian revolution during the period of the N.E.P.)   aided by the failure to nationalise the land: the capitalist elements in trade,   and even in light industry, might provide a base for capitalist counter-revolution.   It must be borne in mind that in China the proletariat is weaker in relation   to the peasantry than was the case in Russia during the N.E.P. owing to the more   backward development of China. Even in Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European   countries similarly, where the capitalist elements were relatively weaker, nevertheless   the danger of a capitalist overturn existed for a time. The fact that the workers   and peasants will not have any democratic control and that the totalitarian   tyranny will have superimposed upon it the Asiatic barbarism and cruelties of   the old regime, gives rise to this possibility. However, it seems likely that   the capitalist elements will be defeated because of the historical tendency   of the decay of capitalism on a world scale. The impotence of world imperialism   is shown by the fact that whereas they intervened directly against the Chinese   revolution in 1925-7, today they look on helplessly at the collapse of the Chiang   regime.</p><p>However, it is quite likely that Stalin will have a new Tito on his hands.   The shrewder capitalist commentators are already speculating on this although   they derive cold comfort from it. Mao will have a powerful base in China with   its 450-500 million population and its potential resources, and the undoubted   mass support his regime will possess in the early stages. The conflicts which   will thus open out should be further means of assisting the world working class   to understand the real nature of Stalinism.</p><!-- begin not in TUT -->
<h4>Balance of forces changed</h4>

<p class="fst">The world balance of forces is being decisively changed. The effect of the Chinese revolution, in however distorted a form, will inevitably prepare the way for upheavals in an Asia already beset with colonial wars of independence and civil wars between the classes in Asiatic society. Imperialism will be irreparably weakened.</p>

<p>Many decades ago Marx wrote that revolution in China could presage the collapse of capitalism in Europe. The editorial writer of the <em>Daily Telegraph </em>, 30<sup>th</sup> November, 1948, wrote with foreboding of its effect on Western Europe:</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Even the defeat of Communist efforts to get control of Western Europe might scarcely compensate for the loss of China, with its immense population and, in Manchuria, valuable industrial potential.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In Shangai, Canton and other big cities, the Trotskyists have established groups among the workers with quite a big influence in some of the illegal trade unions. They remain true to the principles of Marx and Lenin. They are establishing the tradition for the Marxist movement which in the long run will lead to the overthrow by revolutionary means, of the bureaucratic regime of Stalinism and the setting up of a healthy workers&#8217; state in which democratic control will rest in the hands of the masses.</p>
