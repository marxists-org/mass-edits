<p class="fst">The document of Comrade Cliff entitled <em>The Nature of Stalinist Russia</em><sup><a href="../../cliff/works/1948/stalruss/index.htm">[source]</a></sup> at 
  first sight gives the impression of erudition and scientific analysis. However, 
  upon careful examination, it will be observed that not one of the chapters contains 
  a worked-out thesis. The method is a series of parallels based on quotations, 
  and its basic weakness is shown by the fact that <em>conclusions are not rooted 
  in the analysis. </em>From his thesis it is not possible to conclude whether 
  Stalinist Russia remains a progressive system (despite its deformations), or 
  whether for Cliff it has now assumed the same reactionary role as &#8216;individual&#8217; 
  capitalism or fascism. The weakness is sharply brought out by the fact that 
  no practical conclusions emerge. Is Russia to be defended, or is the revolutionary 
  party to be defeatist? Instead of the answer being rooted in and flowing from 
  the analysis, it has to be worked out <em>a posteriori</em>.</p>


<p>Despite the fact that Comrade Cliff <em>asserts </em>that the Stalinist bureaucracy 
  is a new class, nowhere in his thesis is a real analysis made or evidence adduced 
  as to why and how such a class constitutes a capitalist class and is not a new 
  type of class.</p>


<p>And this is not accidental. It flows from the method. Starting off with the 
  preconceived idea of state capitalism, everything is artificially fitted into 
  that conception. Instead of applying the theoretical method of the Marxist teachers 
  to Russian society in its process of motion and development, he has scoured 
  the works to gather quotations and attempted to compress them into a theory.</p>


<p>Nowhere in the document does Cliff pose the main criterion for Marxists in 
  analysing social systems: <em>Does the new formation lead to the development 
  of the productive forces? </em>The theory of Marxism is based on the material 
  development of the forces of production as the moving force of historical progress. 
  The transition from one system to another is not decided subjectively, but is 
  rooted in the needs of production itself. It is on this basis and this basis 
  only that the superstructure is erected: of state, ideology, art, science. It 
  is true that the superstructure has an important secondary effect on production 
  and even within certain limits, as Engels explained, develops its own independent 
  movement. But in the last analysis, the development of production is decisive.</p>


<p>Marx explained the historical justification for capitalism, depite the horrors 
  of the industrial revolution, despite the slavery of the blacks in Africa, despite 
  child labour in the factories, the wars of conquest throughout the globe - by 
  the fact that it was a necessary stage in the development of the forces of production. 
  Marx showed that without slavery, not only ancient slavery, but slavery in the 
  epoch of the early development of capitalism, the modern development of production 
  would have been impossible. Without that the material basis for communism could 
  never have been prepared. In <em>Poverty of Philosophy </em>Marx wrote:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Direct slavery is just as much the pivot of bourgeois industry as machinery, 
  credits, etc. Without slavery you have no cotton; without cotton you have no 
  modern industry. It is slavery that has given the colonies their value; it is 
  the colonies that have created world trade, and it is world trade that is the 
  precondition of large-scale industry. Thus slavery is an economic category of 
  the greatest importance.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Without slavery North America, the most progressive of countries, would 
  be transformed into a patriarchal country. Wipe out North America from the map 
  of the world, and you will have anarchy - the complete decay of modern commerce 
  and civilisation.&quot;
<a href="../../marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02.htm#s4">[source]</a></p>


<p>Of course, the attitude of Marx towards the horrors of slavery and the industrial 
  revolution is well known. It would be a gross distortion of Marx&#8217;s position 
  to argue that because he wrote the above, therefore he was in favour of slavery 
  and child labour. No more can it be argued against the Marxists of today that 
  because they support state ownership in the USSR that they therefore justify 
  the slave camps and other crimes of the Stalin regime.</p>


<p>Marx&#8217;s support of Bismarck<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup> in the Franco-Prussian war was dictated by similar considerations. 
  In spite of Bismarck&#8217;s &#8216;blood and iron&#8217; policy and the reactionary nature of 
  his regime, because the development of the productive forces would be facilitated 
  by the national unification of Germany, Marx gave critical support for the war 
  of Prussia against France. The basic criterion was the development of the productive 
  forces. In the long run, all else flows from this.</p>


<p>Any analysis of Russian society must start from that basis. Once Cliff admits 
  that while capitalism is declining and decaying on a world scale, yet preserving 
  a progressive role in Russia in relation to the development of the productive 
  forces, then logically he would have to say that state capitalism is the next 
  stage forward for society, or at least for the backward countries. Contradictorily, 
  he shows that the Russian bourgeoisie was not capable of carrying through the 
  role which was fulfilled by the bourgeoisie in the West and consequently the 
  proletarian revolution took place.</p>


<p>If we have state capitalism in Russia (ushered in by a proletarian revolution), 
  then it is clear that the crisis of capitalism on which we have based ourselves 
  for the past decades was not insoluble but purely the birth pangs of a new and 
  higher stage of capitalism. The quotation he himself gives from Marx - that 
  no society passes from the scene till all the possibilities in it have been 
  exhausted would indicate that if his argument is correct, a new epoch, the epoch 
  of state capitalism, opens up before us. This would shatter the entire theoretical 
  basis of the Leninist-Trotskyist movement. Cliff says, without explaining why, 
  that if we hold on to the theory of the degenerated revolution, we must abandon 
  the theory of the permanent revolution. Yet he fails to see that to accept the 
  theory of state capitalism, the theory of the permanent revolution, which is 
  based on the idea that capitalism has so exhausted itself on a world scale that 
  it is incapable of even carrying out the tasks of the bourgeois democratic revolution 
  in backward countries, would have to be abandoned. For in Eastern Europe, the 
  &#8216;state capitalists&#8217; would have carried out the tasks of the bourgeois revolution 
  on the land etc. Cliff skirts around this question of the agrarian revolution, 
  which in the backward countries, Trotsky argued, only the proletariat could 
  carry through. If the &#8216;state capitalist&#8217; parties of the Stalinists can perform 
  this task, not only is the theory of the permanent revolution thrown out of 
  the window, but the viability of the new state capitalism in a historical sense 
  must be clear to all.</p>


<p>If Comrade Cliff&#8217;s thesis is correct, that state capitalism exists in Russia 
  today, then he cannot avoid the conclusion that state capitalism has been in 
  existence since the Russian Revolution and the function of the revolution itself 
  was to introduce this state capitalist system of society. For despite his tortuous 
  efforts to draw a line between the economic basis of Russian society before 
  the year 1928 and after, the economic basis of Russian society has in fact remained 
  unchanged. </p>


<h4>Incorrect Usage of Quotations</h4>

<p>Comrade Cliff seeks to prove that Trotsky was moving to the position that the 
  bureaucracy was a new ruling class. For this purpose he gives quotations from 
  the book <em>Stalin</em>, and then from <em>Living Thoughts of Karl Marx.</em></p>


<p>Cliff writes:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;A clear step in the direction of a new evaluation of the bureaucracy 
  as a ruling class finds expression in Trotsky&#8217;s last book, <em>Stalin</em>. He 
  writes:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;&#8217;The substance of Thermidor was, is and could not fail to be social in 
  character. It stood for the crystallisation of a new privileged stratum, the 
  creation of a new substratum for the economically dominant class. There were 
  two pretenders to this role: the petty bourgeoisie and the bureaucracy itself. 
  They fought shoulder to shoulder (in the battle to break) the resistance of 
  the proletarian vanguard. When that task was accomplished a savage struggle 
  broke out between them. The bureaucracy became frightened of its isolation, 
  its divorce from the proletariat. Alone it could not crush the kulak
<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup>
 nor the petty bourgeoisie that had grown and continued to 
  grow on the basis of the NEP; it had to have the aid of the proletariat. Hence 
  its concerted effort to present its struggle against the petty bourgeoisie for 
  the surplus products and for power as the struggle of the proletariat against 
  attempts at capitalistic restoration&#8217;.&quot; (<em>The Nature of Stalinist Russia,   </em>Tony Cliff, June 1948, page 10)
<a href="../../trotsky/1939/04/marxism.htm">[source]</a>
</p>


<p>And Comrade Cliff comments:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The bureaucracy, Trotsky says, while pretending to fight against the 
  capitalistic restoration, in reality used the proletariat only to crush the 
  kulaks for &#8216;the crystallisation of a new privileged stratum, the creation of 
  a new substratum for the economically dominant class&#8217;. One of the pretenders 
  to the role of the economically dominant class, he says, is the bureaucracy. 
  Great emphasis is lent to this formulation when we connect this analysis with 
  the fight between the bureaucracy and the kulaks with Trotsky&#8217;s definition of 
  the class struggle. He says: &#8216;The class struggle is nothing else than the struggle 
  for surplus produce. He who owns surplus-produce is master of the situation 
  - owns wealth, owns the state, has the key to the Church, to the courts, to 
  the sciences and to the arts&#8217;.&quot; (Cliff, page 10)</p>


<p>And Cliff concludes:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The fight between the bureaucracy and the kulaks was, according to Trotsky&#8217;s 
  last conclusion, the &#8216;struggle...for the surplus products&#8217;.&quot;</p>


<p>To illustrate the way in which Comrade Cliff has constructed his case, let 
  us examine these quotations <em>in context </em>and we will see that the conclusion 
  that flows is <em>precisely the opposite </em>to what he argues:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The kulak, jointly with the petty industrialists, worked for the complete 
  restoration of capitalism. <em>Thus opened the irreconcilable struggle over the 
  surplus product of national labour. </em>Who will dispose of it in the nearest 
  future - the new bourgeoisie or the Soviet bureaucracy? - that became the next 
  issue. He who disposed of the surplus product has the power of the state at 
  his disposal. It was all this that opened the struggle between the petty bourgeoisie, 
  which had helped the bureaucracy to crush the resistance of the labouring masses 
  and of their spokesmen the Left Opposition, and the Thermidorean bureaucracy 
  itself, which had helped the petty bourgeoisie to lord it over the agrarian 
  masses. It was a direct struggle for power and income.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Obviously the bureaucracy did not rout the proletarian vanguard, pull 
  from the complications of the international revolution, and legitimise the philosophy 
  of inequality in order to capitulate before the bourgeoisie, become the latter&#8217;s 
  servant, and be eventually itself pulled away from the state feed-bag.&quot; 
  (<em>Stalin</em> by Leon Trotsky, Harper, London 1941, page 397, our emphasis)</p>


<p>Cliff makes Trotsky look foolish by appearing to contradict himself by juxtaposing 
  the two quotations and adducing therefrom that Trotsky was changing his position 
  on the class character of the bureaucracy. A few pages further on, Trotsky explains 
  his idea. He shows the organic tendency of the decay of capitalism everywhere. 
  It is only on this basis that the nationalised productive forces have been maintained 
  in Russia. The whole tendency of the economy in the last 50 years on a world 
  scale has been towards the statification of the productive forces. The capitalists 
  themselves have in part been compelled to &#8216;the recognition of the productive 
  forces as social forces&#8217; (Engels). In fact, this is the key to the explanation 
  of why Russia survived the war. The disorientation of the movement which is 
  expressed in Cliff&#8217;s document, is largely due to the failure to appreciate the 
  implications of this tendency. In his book on Stalin, Trotsky raises the theoretical 
  possibility of the bureaucracy continuing to rule for some decades.</p>


<p>A few pages after the quotations given by Cliff, Trotsky says:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The counter-revolution sets in when the spool of progressive social conquests 
  begins to unwind. There seems no end to this unwinding. Yet some portion of 
  the conquests of the revolution is always preserved. Thus, in spite of monstrous 
  bureaucratic distortions, the class basis of the USSR remains proletarian. But 
  let us bear in mind that the unwinding process has not yet been completed, and 
  the future of Europe and the world during the next few decades has not yet been 
  decided. The Russian Thermidor would undoubtedly have opened a new era of bourgeois 
  rule, if that rule had not proved obsolete throughout the world. At any rate 
  the struggle against equality and the establishment of very deep social differentiation 
  has so far been unable to eliminate the socialist consciousness of the masses 
  or the nationalisation of the means of production and the land, which were the 
  basic socialist conquests of the revolution...&quot; (<em>Stalin, </em>page 
  405)</p>


<p>We believe this sufficiently demonstrates that Cliff has taken a quotation 
  from Trotsky&#8217;s Stalin out of context and read something into it which is not 
  there. In his last work, as in all others on the Russian question, Trotsky had 
  a consistent theme in his characterisation of the Soviet Union. It is not possible 
  to draw the conclusion from any of his writings that he was altering his fundamental 
  position.</p>


<h4>Can there be a Struggle between Two Sections of the Same Class? French Revolution 
  - Russian Revolution</h4>

<p>To understand the Russian Revolution we can take the analogy of the French 
  Revolution which is striking in its similarity and course although obviously 
  on a different economic basis. As is known, the rule of the bourgeoisie was 
  ushered in in France in the revolution of 1789. Marx explains the progressive 
  rule of the revolutionary Jacobins: this revolutionary dictatorship of the <em>sans 
  culottes </em>went further than the bourgeois regime. Because of that they made 
  a clean sweep of all feudal rubbish, and did in months what the bourgeoisie 
  would have required decades to achieve. This was followed by the Thermidorian 
  reaction and the Bonapartist counter-revolution.</p>


<p>Anyone who compared the Bonapartist counter-revolution with the revolution 
  - at least in its superstructure - would have found as great a difference as 
  between the regime of Lenin and Trotsky in Russia and that of Stalin in latter 
  years. To superficial observers the difference between the two regimes was fundamental. 
  In fact, insofar as the superstructure was concerned, the difference was glaring. 
  Napoleon had reintroduced many of the orders, decorations and ranks similar 
  to those of feudalism; he had restored the Church; he even had himself crowned 
  Emperor. Yet despite this counter-revolution, it is clear that it had nothing 
  in common with the old regime. <em>It was counter-revolution on the basis of 
  the new form of property introduced by the revolution itself. </em>Bourgeois 
  forms of property or property relations remained the basis of the economy.</p>


<p>When we study the further history of France, we see the variety of forms of 
  government and of the superstructure which developed in the course of the class 
  struggle. The restoration of the monarchy after the defeat of Napoleon, the 
  revolutions of 1830 and of 1848 - what was the <em>class </em>struggle there? 
  There was a different division of the income, but after all these revolutions 
  the economy remained <em>bourgeois.</em></p>


<p>The subsequent history of France saw the dictatorship of Louis Bonaparte, the 
  restoration of bourgeois democracy and the Republic and, in recent days, the 
  regime of Petain. Under all these regimes there were differences in the division 
  of the national income between the classes and between different strata of the 
  ruling class itself. Yet we call all these regimes bourgeois. Why? It can only 
  be because of the form of property.</p>


<p>Given the backwardness of the Soviet Union, which is very well explained by 
  Cliff, and the isolation of the revolution, why should not a similar process 
  take place? In fact it did. Let us return to Trotsky&#8217;s book <em>Stalin</em>. The 
  Old Man was clear. After the quotation where Trotsky shows that the substance 
  of the Thermidor could not but be social in character and was the struggle for 
  the surplus product, he went on to explain what was meant. Let us continue where 
  Cliff stopped:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Here the analogy with French Thermidor ceases. The new social basis of 
  the Soviet Union became paramount. <em>To guard the nationalisation of 
  the means of production and of the land, is the bureaucracy&#8217;s law of life and 
  death, for these are the social sources of its dominant position. </em>That was 
  the reason for its struggle against the kulak. The bureaucracy could wage this 
  struggle, and wage it to the end, only with the support of the proletariat. 
  The best proof of the fact that it had mustered this support was the avalanche 
  of capitulations by representatives of the new Opposition.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The fight against the kulak, the fight against the right wing, the fight 
  against opportunism - the official slogans of that period - seemed to the workers 
  and to many representatives of the Left Opposition like a renaissance of the 
  dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist revolution. We warned them 
  at the time: it is not only a question of <em>what </em>is being done, but also 
  of <em>who </em>does it. Under conditions of Soviet democracy, ie, self-rule of 
  the toilers, the struggle against the kulaks might not have assumed such a convulsive, 
  panicky and bestial form and might have led to a general rise of the economic 
  and cultural level of the masses on the basis of industrialisation. But the 
  bureaucracy&#8217;s fight against the kulak was single combat (fought) on the backs 
  of the toilers; and since neither of the embattled gladiators trusted the masses, 
  since both feared the masses, the struggle assumed an extremely convulsive and 
  sanguinary character. Thanks to the support of the proletariat, it ended with 
  victory for the bureaucracy. But it did not lead to a gain in the specific weight 
  of the proletariat in the country&#8217;s political life.&quot; (<em>Stalin </em>page 
  408, our emphasis)</p>


<p>When Trotsky speaks here of &#8216;the creation of a new substratum for the economically 
  dominant class&#8217; what is clearly meant is the proletariat, which dominates through 
  the form of property. Cliff says: &#8216;<em>One of the pretenders to the role 
  of the economically dominant class, he says, is the bureaucracy. Great emphasis 
  is lent to this formulation</em>...&#8217; Here we see the dangers in the 
  method of working on the basis of preconceived ideas and the attempt to select 
  quotations to fit into these ideas.</p>


<p>In this same chapter, Trotsky shows the similarity and the differences with 
  the French revolution and why the reaction took a different form in France to 
  that which it took in Russia:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The privileges of the bureaucacy have a different source of origin. The 
  bureaucracy took for itself that part of the national income which it could 
  secure either by the exercise of force or of its authority or by direct intervention 
  in economic relations. In the matter of the national surplus product the bureaucracy 
  and the petty bourgeoisie quickly changed from alliance to enmity. The control 
  of the surplus product opened the bureaucracy&#8217;s road to power.&quot; (<em>Stalin</em>, 
  page 40)</p>


<p>The theme of Trotsky is sufficiently clear. The struggle for the surplus product 
  can be waged not only between different classes, but between different strata 
  and different groupings representing the same class.</p>


<h4>Does the law of Value Operate within the Russian Economy?</h4>

<p>The whole of the section of Cliff&#8217;s document on the law of value is unsound 
  from a Marxist point of view. In the most involved and peculiar manner he argues 
  that the law of value does not apply within the Russian economy, but only in 
  its relations to world capitalism. He finds the basis of the law of value, not 
  in Russian society, but in the world capitalist environment.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Let us now find out what importance the internal relations in Russia 
  has when abstracted from the influence of world economy.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The abstraction has solved one fundamental question: that <em>the source 
  of the activity of the law of value is not to be found in the internal 
  relations of Russian economy itself. </em>In other words it has brought us so 
  far nearer solving the problem of whether the Russian economy is subordinated 
  to the law of value by showing us <em>where not to look </em>for its source.&quot; 
  (Cliff, page 98. Emphasis in original)</p>


<p>According to the Marxist view, it is in <em>exchange </em>that the law of value 
  manifests itself. And this holds true for all forms of society. For example, 
  the way in which the break-up of primitive communism took place was through 
  the exchange and barter between different primitive communities. This led to 
  the development of private property. In slave society, in the same way, the 
  products of the slave <em>became commodities </em>when they were exchanged. Through 
  this development, the &#8216;commodity of commodities&#8217; appeared: money. It was thus 
  that the product enslaved the producer and in the end the contradiction caused 
  by the money economy resulted in the destruction of the old slave society. Under 
  feudalism, the exchange of the <em>surplus </em>produced by the self-sufficient 
  lords and barons in their &#8216;natural economy&#8217; became commodities, and in fact, 
  was the starting point of capitalist development through the rise of <em>merchant 
  capital.</em></p>


<p>Therefore, if it was in exchange only between Russia and the outside world 
  that the law of value manifested itself, all that this would mean is that the 
  <em>Russian surplus </em>was exchanged on the basis of the law of value. What 
  consequences that would have for the internal economy is a different question 
  which would have to be worked out.</p>


<p>However, because of the small degree of participation of the Soviet Union on 
  the world market, in comparison with the total production of Russia, Cliff unavoidably 
  realises the weakness of this point. Thus, amazingly, Cliff finds the law of 
  value manifesting itself not in <em>exchange, </em>but in <em>competition. </em>Even 
  this would not be so bad if he argued that this was competition on the world 
  market on classical capitalist lines for markets. But he cannot argue this because 
  it is at variance with the facts. So he introduces a new conception. He finds 
  his &#8216;competition&#8217; and his &#8216;law of value&#8217; in the production of armaments!</p>


<p>The pressure of world capitalism forces Russia to devote an enormous proportion 
  of the national income on armaments production and defence on the one hand, 
  and the greatest capital construction in history in proportion to the national 
  income for the needs of defence, on the other. Here Cliff finds his law of value. 
  The law of value manifests itself in the armaments competition between two social 
  systems! This can only be described as a concession to Shachtman&#8217;s theory of 
  bureaucratic collectivism. If this theory is correct, the theory of an entirely 
  new economy, never before seen in history or foreseen by the Marxists, would 
  apply.</p>


<p>Here again we would point out the dangers of indiscriminate use of quotations 
  and amalgamations of ideas to form a &#8216;thesis&#8217;. In reality this document is not 
  a state capitalist document; it is a hybrid in the union of bureaucratic collectivism 
  and state capitalism. If this section of Cliff&#8217;s document means anything at 
  all, it leads straight to the road of Schachtman&#8217;s bureaucratic collectivism.</p>


<p>This idea is partially borrowed from Hilferding<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">(3)</a></sup>
 who consistently argued that in Russia and in nazi Germany 
  the law of value did not apply and that these were entirely new social formations. 
  It is also based on a misunderstanding of some passages in Bukharin&#8217;s <em>Imperialism 
  and the World Economy</em>, where he argued on the basis of &#8216;state capitalism&#8217; 
  - the organic union of trusts with finance capital - and in which he, together 
  with Lenin, brilliantly prophesied a form of dictatorship which was later realised 
  in Italian fascism and nazism. Not state ownership of the means of production, 
  but the fusion of finance capital with the state. In fact Bukharin chose as 
  one of his classic examples of such a state...America.</p>


<p>The argument on armaments partakes of a mystical and not an economic category. 
  At best, even if we accepted it as correct, it would only explain why Russian 
  produces armaments, but not <em>how </em>or on what economic basis the armaments 
  are produced. Even if Russia were a healthy workers&#8217; state, in imperialist encirclement, 
  there would be the absolute necessity to produce armaments and compete with 
  the arms technique and production of the rival capitalist systems. But this 
  argument about armaments is entirely false. The greater part of production in 
  Russia is not armaments but means of production. Again, this would explain why 
  the bureaucracy is attempting to accumulate the means of production at a frantic 
  speed, but it explains nothing of the economic system of production itself. 
  It is probably true that in a healthy workers&#8217; state accumulation of arms would 
  be smaller for social reasons (internationalist and revolutionary policy towards 
  workers in other lands), but it would nevertheless take place under the pressure 
  of world imperialism.</p>


<p>A quicker or slower tempo in the development of the means of production does 
  not necessarily tell us the method by which these are produced. Cliff says that 
  the bureaucracy is developing the means of production under the pressure of 
  world imperialism. Good. But all this tells us again is why the pace is fast. 
  From the point of view of even classical bourgeois political economy, Cliff&#8217;s 
  argument is a pure evasion. It merely poses what has to be proved.</p>


<p>Not for nothing did Trotsky point out in <em>Revolution Betrayed </em>that the 
  whole progressive content of the activity of the Stalinist bureaucracy and its 
  preoccupation, was the raising of the productivity of labour and the defence 
  of the country.</p>


<p>We have seen that if the law of value only applies because of the existence 
  of capitalism in world economy, <em>then it would only apply to those products 
  exchanged on the world market. </em>But Cliff argues two contradictory theses 
  in relation to the Russian economy. On the one hand he says:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;<em>This does not mean that the price system in Russia is arbitrary, dependent 
  on the whim of the bureaucracy. The basis of price here too is the costs of 
  production. </em>If price is to be used as a transmission belt through which 
  the bureaucracy directs production as a whole, it must fit its purpose, and 
  <em>as nearly as possible reflect the real costs, that is, the socially necessary 
  Labour absorbed in the different products...</em>&quot; (Cliff, page 
  94, our emphasis)</p>


<p>Two pages later, Cliff describes as the <em>central point </em>he intends to 
  prove:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;...that in the economic relations <em>within Russia itself </em>one 
  cannot find the autonomy of economic activity, the <em>source </em>of the law 
  of value, acting.&quot; (Cliff, page 96, emphasis in original)</p>


<p>In the first quotation, <em>Cliff shows precisely the way in which the law of 
  value manifests itset internally in Russian society. </em>Even if one abstracts 
  from the world market, leaving aside the interacting effect which it undoubtedly 
  has - when Cliff says that &#8216;the real costs, that is the socially necessary labour 
  absorbed in the different products&#8217; must reflect the real prices, he is saying 
  that the same law applies in Russian society as in capitalist society. The difference 
  is that whereas in capitalist society it manifests itself blindly by the laws 
  of the markets, in Russia conscious activity plays an important role. In this 
  connection the second quotation crushingly refutes Cliff&#8217;s argument that it 
  is <em>capitalism </em>which exists in Russia under these given conditions because 
  the law of value does not operate blindly, but is consciously harnessed. In 
  capitalist society, the law of value, as he says, manifests itself through the 
  &#8216;autonomy of economic activity&#8217;, ie, it is the market which dominates. The first 
  quotation shows clearly that the market - and this is the point - is within 
  given limits controlled consciously and therefore it is not capitalism as understood 
  by Marxists.</p>


<p>Previously Cliff said that the law of value did not operate in Russia. Here 
  he is showing precisely how it does operate: not on the lines of classical capitalism, 
  but of a transitional society between capitalism and socialism.</p>


<p>We see therefore, that Cliff claims that Russia is a capitalist society - yet 
  he finds the source of the basic law of capitalist production outside of Russia. 
  Now, in any capitalist society in which the reserve fund is in the hands of 
  the capitalist class, as Engels explained:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;... if this production and reserve fund does in fact exist in the hands 
  of the capitalist class, if it has in fact arisen through the accumulation of 
  profit...then it necessarily consists of the accumulated surplus of the product 
  of labour handed over to the capitalist class by the working class, over and 
  above the sum of wages paid to the working class by the capitalist class. In 
  this case, however, it is not wages that determine value, but the quantity of 
  labour; in this case the working class hands over to the capitalist class in 
  the product of labour a greater quantity of value than it receives from it in 
  the shape of wages; and then the profit on capital like all other forms of appropriation 
  without payment of the labour product of others, is explained as a simple component 
  part of the surplus value discovered by Marx.&quot; (<em>Anti-D&uuml;hring</em>, Progress 
  Publishers, Moscow 1969, page 233)
<a href="../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch17.htm">[source]</a></p>


<p>This indicates that where there is wage labour, where there is the accumulation 
  of capital, <em>the law of value must apply, </em>no matter in how complicated 
  a form it may manifest itself. Further on Engels explains in answer to D&uuml;hring&#8217;s<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-4" name="doc-4">(4)</a></sup> 
  five kinds of value, and the &#8216;natural costs of production&#8217;, that in <em>Capital</em> 
  Marx is dealing with the value of commodities and &#8216;in the whole section of <em>Capital</em> 
  which deals with value there is not even the slightest indication of whether 
  or to what extent Marx considers the theory of value of commodities applicable 
  to other forms of society&#8217;. In this sense it is clear that in the transitional 
  society also: &#8216;Value itself is nothing more than the expression of the socially 
  necessary labour materialised in an object.&#8217; Here it is only necessary to ask: 
  what determines the value of machines, consumer goods, etc, produced in Russia? 
  Is it arbitrary? What determines the calculations of the bureaucracy? What is 
  it that they measure in price? What determines wages? Are wages payments for 
  labour power? What determines &#8216;money&#8217;? What determines profits of enterprises? 
  Is there capital? Is the division of labour abolished?</p>


<p>Cliff gives two contradictory answers to these questions. On the one hand he 
  agrees that it is the law of value on which all calculations and the movement 
  of Russian society develops. On the other, he finds the law of value only operating 
  as the result of pressure from the outside world although how he does not explain 
  in any serious way.</p>


<h4>The Role of Money in Russia</h4>

<p>The surprising thing is that Cliff himself points out that the bureaucracy 
  does not and cannot determine prices arbitrarily. That it does not and cannot 
  determine the amount of money in circulation arbitrarily either. And this has 
  been so in every society where money (let us remember, the commodity of commodities) 
  has played a role. Engels, dealing with this problem, pertinently asked D&uuml;hring:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;If the sword (no matter who wields it - bureaucrat, capitalist, or government 
  - EG) has the magic economic power ascribed to it by Herr D&uuml;hring, why is it 
  that no government has been able to succeed in permanently compelling bad money 
  to have the &#8216;distribution value&#8217; of good money, or <em>assignats</em> to have the &#8216;distribution 
  value&#8217; of gold? (<em>Anti-D&uuml;hring</em>, page 228)
<a href="../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch17.htm">[source]</a></p>


<p>In<em> Revolution Betrayed, </em>Trotsky explains this problem very clearly. 
  He shows that the economic categories peculiar to capitalism still remain in 
  the transitional society between capitalism and communism, the dictatorship 
  of the proletariat. Here is the key: the laws remain, but are <em>modified. </em>Some 
  of the laws of capitalism apply and some are abrogated. For example, Trotsky 
  argues:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The role of money in Soviet economy is not only unfinished but, as we 
  have said, still has a long growth ahead. The transitional epoch between capitalism 
  and socialism taken as a whole does not mean a cutting down of trade but, on 
  the contrary, its extraordinary extension. All branches of industry transform 
  themselves and grow. New ones continually arise, and all are compelled to define 
  their relations to one another both quantitatively and qualitatively. The liquidation 
  of the consummatory peasant economy, and at the same time of the shut-in family 
  life, means a transfer to the sphere of social interchange, and <em>ipso facto 
  </em>money circulation, of all the labour energy which was formerly expended 
  within the limits of the peasant&#8217;s yard, or within the walls of his private 
  dwelling. <em>All products and services begin for the first time in history 
  to be exchanged for one another</em>.&quot; (<em>Revolution Betrayed, </em>NY, 
  1972, page 67, our emphasis)
<a href="../../trotsky/1936/revbet/ch04.htm#ch04-1">[source]</a></p>


<p>What is the key to this enigma? It can only be found in the fact that we have 
  here a transitional society. <em>The state can now regulate, but not arbitrarily, 
  only within the confines of the law of value. </em>Any attempt to violate and 
  pass beyond the strict limits set by the development of the productive forces 
  themselves, immediately results in the re-assertion of the domination of production 
  over producer. This is what Stalin had to discover in relation to price and 
  money when the Russian economy was inflicted with a crisis of inflation which 
  completely distorted and disrupted the plan. The law of value is not abolished, 
  but is <em>modified. </em>This is what Trotsky meant when he said:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The nationalisation of the means of production and credit, the co-operativising 
  or state-ising of internal trade, the monopoly of foreign trade, the collectivisation 
  of agriculture, the law of inheritance - set strict limits upon the personal 
  accumulation of money and hinder its conversion into private capital (usurious, 
  commercial and industrial). These functions of money, however, bound up as they 
  are with exploitation, are not liquidated at the beginning of a proletarian 
  revolution, but in a modified form are transferred to the state, the universal 
  merchant, creditor and industrialist. At the same time the more elementary functions 
  of money as <em>measure of value, means of exchange </em>and <em>medium of 
  payment, </em>are not only preserved, but acquire a broader field of action than 
  they had under capitalism.&quot; (<em>Revolution Betrayed, </em>page 66, 
  emphasis in original)<a href="../../trotsky/1936/revbet/ch04.htm#ch04-1">[source]</a></p>


<p>One has only to pose the problem in this way to see that an economic analysis 
  must lead one to conclude that we have here a transitional society in which 
  some of the laws peculiar to socialism apply and some peculiar to capitalism. 
  That is after all, the meaning of <em>transition.</em></p>


<p>Although Cliff does not recognise this, in fact he admits it, because when 
  he says that the bureaucracy can consciously regulate (though within limits) 
  the rate of investment, the proportions between means of production and means 
  of consumption, the price of articles of consumption, etc, <em>he is proving 
  that certain of the basic laws of capitalism do not apply.</em></p>


<p>Is there a transformation of money into capital in Russia? In polemicising 
  against Stalin, Trotsky answers this by showing that the investments are made 
  on the basis of a plan, but nevertheless, what is <em>invested </em>is the surplus 
  value produced by the workers. Here Trotsky shows the basic fallacy in Stalin&#8217;s 
  idea that the state could decide and regulate without reference to the economy. 
  We might add that Stalin never denied that there was commodity production in 
  Russia.</p>


<p>In spite of the fact that there is only one &#8216;employer&#8217; in Russia, nevertheless, 
  the state buys labour power. It is true that because of the full employment 
  which would normally place the seller of the commodity labour power in a strong 
  position, the state has imposed various restrictions on the free sale of labour 
  power, just as in a period of full employment under fascism. Or even in Labour 
  Britain, where the same situation exists, by means of regulations and devices 
  the employers have the state intervene to offset the advantages which accrue 
  from this situation for the sale of labour power. But only one who argued in 
  abstractions, could argue that this negated labour power.</p>


<p>It is true that in the classical capitalist economy there was free sale of 
  labour power. However, in Marx&#8217;s <em>Capital</em> itself there was a whole section 
  devoted to showing the ferocious laws which were introduced against the nascent 
  proletariat after the Black Death in England had so reduced the population that 
  the proletarians were in a favourable position to demand higher wages. Did this 
  mean that the basic Marxian laws did not apply? On the contrary, Marx was dealing 
  with a &#8216;pure&#8217; capitalism which never did exist, from which he extracted the 
  fundamental laws. The distortion of this or that element will not alter the 
  basic laws. That is why in nazi Germany, despite many perversions, it remained 
  fundamentally a system of capitalist economy, because the economy was dominated 
  by production on the basis of private property.</p>


<p>One has only to compare the slave labourer in Siberia with the proletariat 
  in the Russian cities to see the difference. The one is a slave based on slave 
  labour, the other is a wage slave. The one sells his labour power, the other 
  is purely an instrument of labour himself. There is the fundamental distinction.</p>


<p>It is not at all accidental that the &#8216;money&#8217; used by the state must <em>necessarily 
  </em>have the same basis as money in capitalist society. Not accidentally, as 
  Trotsky explained, <em>the only real money </em>in Russia (or in any transitional 
  economy - even an ideal workers&#8217; state) <em>must be based on gold. </em>The recent 
  rouble devaluation in Russia was in itself a striking confirmation of the fact 
  that the law of money circulation, and thus of the circulation of commodities, 
  maintains its validity in Russia. In a transitional economy the economic categories 
  of money, value, surplus value, etc, must necessarily continue as elements of 
  the old society within the new society.</p>


<p>Cliff argues that &#8216;the most important source of state income is the turn-over 
  tax, which is an indirect tax.&#8217; He introduced interesting material showing the 
  tremendous burden which the turn-over tax imposes upon the masses.</p>


<p>However, the turn-over tax to which he refers in connection with the exploitation 
  of the masses, in an indirect way, proves that the law of value applies in Russian 
  society. Cliff shows how the turn-over tax <em>applies </em>in Russia. But he 
  does not see that this tax must be <em>based </em>on something. No matter how 
  much the state might add to the price by placing an additional tax, the price 
  must be based on something: what else can this be but the value of the product, 
  the socially necessary labour time contained in it?</p>


<p>Engels ridiculed D&uuml;hring&#8217;s tax by the sword, out of which the surplus is developed, 
  when he said:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Or, on the other hand, the alleged tax surcharges represent a real sum 
  of value, namely that produced by the labouring, value-producing class but appropriated 
  by the monopolist class, and then this sum of value consists merely of unpaid 
  labour; in this event, in spite of the man with the sword in his hand, <em>in 
  spite of the alleged tax surcharges, </em>we come once again to the Marxian 
  theory of <em>surplus value.</em>&quot; (<em>Anti-D&uuml;hring</em>, page 226)
<a href="../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch17.htm">[source]</a></p>


<p>The turn-over tax in Russia and the other manipulations of the bureaucracy 
  do not in any way invalidate the law of value. What is the essence of the law 
  of value? That the value of the product is determined by the average amount 
  of socially necessary labour time. That must be the point of departure. <em>It 
  necessarily manifests itself through exchange. </em>Marx devoted a great part 
  of his first volume of <em>Capital </em>to explaining the historical development 
  of the commodity form from accidental exchange among savages through its transitions, 
  till we arrive at commodity production par excellence, capitalist production.</p>


<p>Even in a classical capitalist economy the law of value does not reveal itself 
  directly. As is known, commodities are sold above or below their value. Only 
  accidentally would a commodity be sold at its actual value. In the third volume 
  of <em>Capital</em> Marx explains the price of production of commodities. That 
  is to say, that the capitalist only gets the cost of production of his commodity 
  plus the average rate of profit. Thus some capitalists will be paid below the 
  actual rate, others above. Because of the different organic composition of different 
  capitals, only in this complicated fashion does the law of value reveal itself. 
  This is effected, of course, through competition. Monopoly is merely a more 
  complicated development of the law of value in society. Because of the controlling 
  position held by some monopolies, they can extort a price above the value of 
  the commodities, but only by other commodities being sold below their value. 
  The total values produced by society would still amount to the same.</p>


<h4>Was there Surplus Value before 1928? Cliff&#8217;s Arbitrary Division</h4>

<p>In this connection, Cliff is not at all consistent. Shachtman, in his endeavour 
  to deny that Russia is a transitional society in which capitalist laws continue 
  to operate, as well as the laws of the future society, at least argues consistently. 
  He says that the law of value does not operate, therefore all the laws flowing 
  from it do not operate. It is not surplus value which is produced, but surplus 
  product; it is not labour power that the workers sell, since they are slaves, 
  etc, etc. Cliff, however, admits that commodity production continues, labour 
  power and surplus value remain. But once these Marxian categories are accepted 
  as valid for Russian society, then clearly the law of value must operate internally, 
  or the whole position becomes nonsensical.</p>


<p>The whole contradiction, a contradiction within the society itself and not 
  imposed abitrarily - is in the very concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
  If one considers the problem in the abstract, one can see that this is a contradictory 
  phenomenon: the abolition of capitalism yet the continuation of classes. The 
  proletariat does not disappear. It raises itself to the position of ruling class 
  and abolishes the capitalist class. But in the intervening period it remains 
  the working class. Therefore, surplus product in the form of surplus value is 
  produced. It is the case today as it was under Lenin and Trotsky. We have only 
  to pose the problem: <em>what was the surplus value produced when Russia 
  was still a workers&#8217; state </em>- though even then with bureaucratic deformations? 
  What was the process by means of which surplus product <em>before </em>1928 mysteriously 
  became surplus value <em>after</em> 1928? What was this curious unexplained process? 
  We would like to ask the question here: Did the existence of capitalism outside 
  Russia before 1928 have a similar effect on Russia&#8217;s economy? Of course it did. 
  In fact a far greater effect because of the weakness of the Russian economy. 
  Why was there not capitalism in Russia then?</p>


<p>Or further: leave aside the period from 1917 to 1923 - what was the situation 
  from 1923 to 1928 when the Stalinist bureaucracy was consolidating itself? There 
  were far more actual individual capitalist elements in the economy of the country 
  then than there are today. The pressure of world capitalism from an economic 
  point of view was indisputably far greater. Merely to pose the problem is to 
  show the arbitrary method.</p>


<p>The abuse of power and the legal and illegal consumption of surplus value by 
  the bureaucracy, necessarily took place even in the early stages of bureaucratic 
  control. Comrade Cliff has to construct a lifeless scheme which bears no relation 
  to reality in order to create a distinction between the two periods: the period 
  when the bureaucracy represented a degenerated workers&#8217; state, and the period 
  when the bureaucracy became a capitalist class. What, according to Cliff, is 
  the difference? Incredible as it may seem, the bureaucracy really earned its 
  income and only from 1928 onwards did they consume surplus value. Cliff writes:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The statistics we have at our disposal conclusively show that although 
  the bureaucracy had a privileged position in the period preceding the Five-Year 
  Plan, it can on no account be said that it received surplus value from the labour 
  of others. It can just as conclusively be said that with the introduction of 
  the Five-Year Plans, the bureaucracy&#8217;s income consisted to a large extent of 
  surplus value.&quot; (page 45)</p>


<p>This is at variance with the analysis made not only by Trotsky but by the other 
  Marxists of the time in relation to this problem. First of all, even in the 
  most ideal workers&#8217; state, in the transitional period there will unavoidably 
  be a certain consumption of the surplus value by the specialists and bureaucrats. 
  Otherwise, we would have the immediate introduction of communism, without any 
  inequalities or the continuance of the division between mental and manual labour. 
  It is only necessary to refer here to the Left Opposition on this very problem. 
  As early as 1927, the Left Opposition commented on the enormous part of the 
  surplus value being consumed by the bureaucratic apparatus. They protested that 
  the &#8216;<em>swollen and privileged administrative apparatus is devouring a very 
  considerable part of the surplus value</em>&#8217;.
<sup><a href="../../trotsky/1927/opposition/ch02.htm">[source]</a></sup>
 (See <em>Revolution Betrayed, </em>page 141)</p>


<p>It is clear that from 1920 onwards, the bureaucracy consumed a great part of 
  the surplus value, legitimately and illegitimately. As Marx explained in any 
  case, in a workers&#8217; state in the transitional period, the surplus value will 
  be used for the speedy building up of industry and so prepare the way for the 
  quickest possible transition to equality and then complete communism.</p>


<p>What else was Lenin speaking of in 1920 and 1921 when he stressed the step 
  backward the Bolsheviks had been forced to make, when they paid the specialists 
  according to bourgeois standards and in the old &#8216;bourgeois way&#8217;?</p>


<h4>The Economics of the Transition from Capitalism to Socialism</h4>

<p>The most significant thing about all tendencies who seek to revise Trotsky&#8217;s 
  position on the Russian question is that they always deal with the problem in 
  the <em>abstract </em>and never concretely explain the laws of the transitional 
  society between capitalism and socialism and how such a society would operate. 
  This is not accidental. A concrete consideration would impel them to the conclusion 
  that <em>the fundamental economy in Russia is the same as it was under Lenin 
  and that it could not be otherwise.</em></p>


<p>The germ of the capitalist mode of production, which began under feudalism 
  through the development of commodity production, lies in the function of the 
  independent craftsmen and merchants. When it reaches a certain stage we have 
  <em>capitalist relations </em>with a feudal superstructure. These are burst asunder 
  by the revolution and the possibilities latent in capitalist production then 
  have the free possibility of fruition unhampered by feudal restrictions.</p>


<p>The whole essence of the revolution (capitalist and proletarian) consists of 
  the fact that the old relationships and the old forms do not correspond with 
  the new ripened method or mode of production. In order to free itself from these 
  restrictions, the productive forces have to be organised on a different basis 
  and the whole of human history and movement of history consists in the development 
  of this antagonism at its various stages in different societies.</p>


<p>However, the bourgeois revolution does not immediately destroy feudalism at 
  one blow. Powerful feudal elements still remain, and to this day the remnants 
  of feudalism exist even in the most highly developed capitalist countries.</p>


<p>One can speak of the feudal mode of production in the sense of the superstructure, 
  despite the capitalist basis which has developed beneath. Or one can even speak 
  of the feudal mode of production at its inception where the germs of capitalism 
  and the possibility of the development of capitalism could be faintly discerned.</p>


<p>The fundamental error of this &#8216;state capitalist&#8217; theory and its abstractions 
  relating to the transitional period, lies in the failure to distinguish between 
  the mode of production and the mode of appropriation. In every class society 
  there is exploitation and a surplus which is utilised by the exploiting class. 
  But in itself this tells us nothing about the mode of production.</p>


<p>For example, the mode of production under capitalism is <em>social </em>in contradiction 
  to the individual form of appropriation. As Engels explained:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The separation between the means of production concentrated in the hands 
  of the capitalists on the one side, and the producers now possessing nothing 
  but their labour power, on the other, was made complete. The contradiction between 
  social production and capitalist [read individual or private, as Engels had 
  already explained - EG] appropriation became manifest as the antagonism between 
  proletariat and bourgeoisie.&quot; (<em>Anti-D&uuml;hring</em>, page 321)
<a href="../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch24.htm">[source]</a></p>


<p>The transitional economy which, as Lenin pointed out, can and will vary enormously 
  in different countries at different times, and even in the same country at different 
  times, also has a social mode of production, but with <em>state appropriation, 
  </em>and not individual appropriation as under capitalism. This is a form which 
  combines both socialist and capitalist features.</p>


<p>Under capitalism, the system of commodity production <em>par excellence, 
  </em>the product completely dominates the producer. This flows from the form 
  of appropriation, and the contradiction between the form of appropriation and 
  the mode of production; both factors flow from <em>the private ownership of the 
  means of production. </em>Once state ownership takes its place, whatever the 
  resulting system may be, it cannot be capitalism because this basic contradiction 
  will have been abolished. The anarchic character of social production with private 
  appropriation disappears.</p>


<p>Under socialism also, there will be a social mode of production <em>but there 
  will also be a social mode of distribution. </em>For the first time production 
  and distribution will be in harmony.</p>


<p>Therefore, merely to point out the capitalist features in Russia today (wage 
  labour, commodity production, that the bureaucracy consumes an enormous part 
  of the surplus value) is not sufficient to tell us the nature of the social 
  system. Here too, an all-sided view is necessary. One can only understand social 
  relationships in the Soviet Union by taking the <em>totality </em>of the relationships. 
  From the very beginning of the revolution various sectarian schools have produced 
  the most untenable ideas as a result of their failure to make such an analysis. 
  Lenin summed up the problem thus:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;But what does the word &#8216;transition&#8217; mean? Does it mean, as applied to 
  economics, that the present order contains elements, particles, pieces of both 
  capitalism and socialism? Everyone will admit that it does. But not all who 
  admit this take the trouble to consider the precise nature of the elements that 
  constitute the various social-economic forms which exist in Russia at the present 
  time. And this is the crux of the question.&quot; (<em>Left wing childishness 
  and the petty-bourgeois mentality</em>, Collected Works, Volume 27, page 335)
<sup><a href="../../lenin/works/1918/may/09.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>


<p>To abstract one side must lead to error. What is puzzling about the Russian 
  phenomenon is precisely the <em>contradictory character </em>of the economy. 
  This has been further aggravated by the backwardness and isolation of the Soviet 
  Union. This culminates in the totalitarian Stalinist regime and results in the 
  worst features of capitalism coming to the fore - the relations between managers 
  and men, piece-work, etc. Instead of analysing these contradictions Comrade 
  Cliff endeavours as far as possible to try and fit them into the pattern of 
  the &#8216;normal&#8217; laws of capitalist production.</p>


<p>In addition, the tendency under capitalism for the productive forces not only 
  to become centralised but even for measures of statification to be introduced 
  can result in a wrong conclusion. To prove that &#8216;state capitalism&#8217; in Russia 
  is in the last analysis the same as individual capitalism with the same laws, 
  Cliff cites the following passage from <em>Anti-D&uuml;hring</em>:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The more productive forces it [the state - TC] takes over, the more it 
  becomes the real collective body of all the capitalists, the more citizens it 
  exploits. The workers remain wage-earners, proletarians. The capitalist relationship 
  is not abolished; it is rather pushed to an extreme. But at this extreme it 
  changes into its opposite. State ownership of the productive forces is not the 
  solution of the conflict, but it contains within itself the formal means, the 
  key to the solution.&quot; (<em>Anti-D&uuml;hring, </em>page 330)
<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch24.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>


<p>In point of fact, Engels is arguing precisely the opposite. Let us re-examine 
  the passages and see how we draw different conclusions:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;<em>If the crisis revealed the incapacity of the bourgeoisie any longer 
  to control the modern productive forces, </em>the conversion of the great organisations 
  for production and communication into joint-stock companies and state property 
  shows that for this purpose the bourgeoisie can he dispensed with. All the social 
  functions of the capitalists are now carried out by salaried employees. <em>The 
  capitalist has no longer any social activity save the pocketing of revenues, 
  the clippng of coupons and gambling on the stock exchange, where the different 
  capitalists fleece each other of their capital. </em>Just as at first the capitalist 
  mode of production displaced the workers, so now it displaces the capitalists, 
  relegating them, just as it did the workers, to the superfluous population, 
  even if in the first instance not to the industrial reserve army.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;But <em>neither the conversion into joint-stock companies nor into state 
  property deprives the productive forces of their character as capital. </em>In 
  the case of joint-stock companies this is obvious. And the modern state, too, 
  is only the organisation with which bourgeois society provides itself in order 
  to maintain the general external <em>conditions of the capitalist mode of production 
  against encroachments either by the workers or by individual capitalists. </em>The 
  modern state, whatever its form, is an essentially capitalist machine; it is 
  the state of the capitalists, the ideal collective body of all capitalists. 
  The more productive forces it takes over as its property, the more it becomes 
  the real collective body of all the capitalists, the more citizens it exploits. 
  <em>The workers remain wage earners, proletarians. The capitalist relationship 
  is not abolished; it is rather pushed to an extreme. But at this extreme it 
  is transformed into its opposite. State ownership of the productive forces is 
  not the solution of the conflict, but it contains within itself the formal means, 
  the key to the solution</em>.&quot; (<em>Anti-D&uuml;hring, </em>page 330, our emphasis)
<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch24.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>


<p>Surely the idea in the foregoing is clear. Insofar as the forces of production 
  have now developed beyond the framework of capitalist relations (that is, the 
  germ of the contradiction has now grown into a malignant disease of the social 
  system, reflecting itself through the crises) the capitalists are compelled 
  to &#8216;socialise&#8217; huge means of production - first, through joint-stock companies 
  and then later, even to &#8216;statify&#8217; sections of the productive forces. This particular 
  idea was brought out sharply by Lenin in <em>Imperialism</em>, where he showed 
  that the development of monopolies and socialisation of labour were in fact 
  <em>elements of the new social system within the old.</em></p>


<p>Once the productive forces had reached this stage, capitalism had already accomplished 
  its historic mission, and because of this the bourgeoisie becomes more and more 
  superfluous. From being a necessity for the development of the forces of production, 
  they now become &#8216;superfluous&#8217;, &#8216;parasites&#8217;, &#8216;coupon-clippers&#8217;. In this they 
  are transformed into parasites in the same way and for the same reason as the 
  feudal lords also became &#8216;parasites&#8217; once their mission had been fulfilled.</p>


<p>This is merely an indication of the ripeness of capitalism for the social revolution. 
  Writing in <em>Capital </em>Marx had shown that credit and joint-stock companies 
  were already an indication that the productive forces had outgrown private ownership. 
  Engels had shown that the <em>social productive forces </em>even compel the capitalists 
  to recognise their character as <em>social </em>and not as <em>individual</em> productive 
  forces.</p>


<p>Wherever the capitalist state is constrained to take over this or that sector 
  of the economy, it is true the productive forces do not lose their character 
  as capital. <em>But the whole essence of the problem is that where we have complete 
  statification, quantity changes into quality, capitalism changes into its opposite.</em></p>


<p>How otherwise explain the statement of Engels: &#8216;<em>But at this extreme it</em> 
  [the capitalist relationship] <em>is transformed into its opposite. </em>State 
  ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but 
  it contains within itself the formal means, the key to the solution&#8217;?</p>


<p>If one takes into account the fact that this follows the previously quoted 
  passage in the <em>same section </em>where Engels defines capitalist mode of production 
  (as social production, individual appropriation), we must conclude that Engels 
  hopelessly contradicts himself, if we accept Cliff&#8217;s conclusions. But from the 
  context, Engels&#8217; meaning is clear. He explains that the solution to the contradictions 
  of capitalism lies in the recognition of the social nature of the modern productive 
  forces: &#8216;In bringing, therefore, the mode of production, appropriation and exchange 
  into accord with the social character of the means of production. &#8216;But he shows 
  that this &#8216;recognition&#8217; precisely consists in asserting <em>conscious </em>organisation 
  and planning, in place of the blind play of forces of the market on the basis 
  of individual ownership. This, however, cannot be done at one stroke. Only &#8216;gradually&#8217; 
  can social control be fully asserted. <em>The transitional form to this is state 
  ownership. </em>But complete state ownership does not abolish all the features 
  of capitalism immediately, otherwise there would be social ownership, ie socialism 
  would be introduced immediately.</p>


<p>But in the same way as we have the new within the old system in the development 
  of society, so in the transitional society we still have <em>the old within the 
  new. </em>Complete statification marks the extreme limit of capital. The capitalist 
  relation is transformed into its opposite. The elements of the new society which 
  were growing up within the old, <em>now become dominant.</em></p>


<p>What causes the conflict within capitalism is the fact that the laws manifest 
  themselves blindly. But once the whole of industry is nationalised, for the 
  first time control and planning can be consciously asserted by the producers. 
  Control and planning will, however, in the first stages, take place within given 
  limits. These limits will be determined by the level of technique when the new 
  social order takes over.</p>


<p>Society cannot step from the realm of necessity into the realm of freedom overnight. 
  Only on the basis of a limitless development of the productive forces will freedom, 
  in its fullest sense, become a reality. The stage will be reached which will 
  witness the &#8216;administration of things&#8217;.</p>


<p>Before such a stage is reached, society must pass through the transitional 
  period. But in so far as immediately after private ownership has been abolished, 
  control and planning become a possibility for the first time, then for the first 
  time also the realm of necessity is left behind. But while it is now possible 
  to speak of &#8216;freedom&#8217;, this is only so in the sense that necessity has become 
  consciously recognised. At this stage (the transitional period), Engels pointed 
  out:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The social character of the means of production and of the products...is 
  quite consciously asserted by the producers, and is transformed from a cause 
  of disorder and periodic collapse into the most powerful level of production 
  itself.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The forces operating in society work exactly like the forces operating 
  in nature; blindly, violently, destructively, so long as we do not understand 
  them and fail to take them into account. But when once we have recognised them 
  and understand how they work, their direction and their effects, <em>the gradual 
  subjection of them to our will </em>and the use of them for the attainment of 
  our aims depends entirely upon ourselves. And this is quite especially true 
  of the mighty productive forces of the present day.&quot; (<em>Anti-D&uuml;hring</em>, 
  page 331, our emphasis)
<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch24.htm">[source (translation differs)]</a></sup></p>


<p>Engels, quoting Hegel, further summed up the relationships between freedom, 
  necessity and the transitional period, thus:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Freedom is the realisation of necessity. &#8216;Necessity is blind only insofar 
  as it is not understood.&quot; (<em>Anti-D&uuml;hring</em>, page 136)
<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch09.htm">[source (translation differs)]</a></sup>
</p>


<p>Marx and Engels only touched on the contradictory character of the transitional 
  period. They left its elaboration to succeeding generations, laying down only 
  the general laws. But clearly they showed the need for <em>state ownership </em>as 
  the necessary transitional state for the development of the productive forces. 
  Engels explained the need for the state during this stage for two reasons:</p>


<ol class="numbered">
  <li>To take measures against the old ruling class.</li>
  <li>Because the transitional society cannot immediately guarantee enough for 
    all.</li>
</ol>

<p>The logic of Cliff&#8217;s thesis is that in the transitional society there are no 
  vestiges of capitalism in the internal economy. While Comrade Cliff may argue 
  vehemently that he agrees with the need for the state in the transitional period, 
  it is evident that <em>he has not thought out the economic reasons which make 
  the state necessary and what character the economy assumes in this period. </em>Before 
  socialism can be introduced there must necessarily be a tremendous development 
  of the forces of production, far beyond those reached under capitalism.</p>


<p>As Trotsky explained, even in America there is still not enough production 
  to guarantee the immediate introduction of socialism. Therefore, there will 
  still have to be an intervening period in which capitalist laws will operate 
  in modified form. Of course, in America, this would be of short duration. But 
  it will not be possible to skip this stage entirely. What are the capitalist 
  laws which will remain? Comrade Cliff not only fails to answer this; he falls 
  into the trap of bureaucratic collectivism by failing to recognise that money, 
  labour power, the existence of the working class, surplus value, etc, <em>are 
  all survivals of the old capitalist system </em>which were carried over even 
  under the regime of Lenin. It is impossible to introduce immediately direct 
  social production and distribution. Particularly was this the case in backward 
  Russia.</p>


<p>Writing to Conrad Schmidt in 1890, Engels gave a magnificent example of the 
  thoroughly materialist approach to the problem of the economics of the transition 
  from capitalism to socialism. He wrote:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;There has been a discussion in the <em>Volkstribune </em>about the division 
  of products in the future society, whether this will take place according to 
  the amount of work done or otherwise. The question has been approached very 
  &#8216;materialistically&#8217;, in opposition to certain idealistic forms of phraseology 
  about justice. But strangely enough it has never struck anyone that, after all, 
  the method of division essentially depends on <em>how much</em> there is to divide, 
  and this must surely change with progress of production and social organisation, 
  so that the method of division may also change. But to everyone who took part 
  in the discussion &#8216;socialist society&#8217; appeared not as involved in continuous 
  change and progress but as a stable affair fixed once and for all which must, 
  therefore, have its method of division fixed once and for all. All one can reasonably 
  do, however, is (1) to try and discover the method of division to be used <em>at 
  the beginning, </em>and (2) to try and find the <em>general tendency </em>in which 
  the further development will proceed. But about this I do not find a single 
  word in the whole debate.&quot; (<em>Marx, Engels, Selected Correspondence, </em>Progress, 
  Moscow, 1975, page 393)<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1890/letters/90_08_05.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>


<p>Writing in <em>Anti-D&uuml;hring, </em>Engels pointed out:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;<em>Direct social production and direct distribution </em>exclude all exchange 
  of commodities, therefore also the transformation of the product into commodities 
  (at any rate within the community) and consequently also their transformation 
  into values.&quot; (<em>Anti-D&uuml;hring</em>, page 366, our emphasis)
<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch26.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>



<p>But only socialism could realise this. In the transitional period, distribution 
  still remains indirect - only gradually does society gain complete control over 
  the product - and therefore the production of commodities and of exchange between 
  the different sectors of production must necessarily take place. The law of 
  value applies and <em>must apply until there is direct access to the product 
  by the producers. </em>This can only take place on the basis of complete control 
  of social production and thus direct social distribution, namely, each individual 
  taking whatever he requires. Marx deals with this problem in passing in Volume 
  III of <em>Capital</em> (Chapter 49), where he is discussing the problem of capitalist 
  production as a whole:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Accordingly a portion of the profit, of surplus value and of the surplus 
  product, in which only newly added labour is represented, so far as its value 
  is concerned, serves as an insurance fund...This is also the only portion 
  of the surplus-value and surplus product and thus of surplus-labour, which would 
  continue to exist, outside of that portion which serves for accumulation and 
  for expansion of the process of reproduction, <em>even after the abolition of 
  the capitalist system</em>...and the fact that all new capital arises out 
  of profit, rent, or other forms of revenue, that is, out of surplus labour...&quot; 
  (<em>Capital</em>, Volume III, Progress, Moscow, 1971, page 847-8, our emphasis)
<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1894-c3/ch49.htm">[source]</a></sup>
</p>


<p>In this chapter Marx is dealing, in an analysis of the process of production, 
  in his own words, with &#8216;the value of the total annual product of labour (which) 
  is under discussion, in other words, the value of the product of the total social 
  capital.&#8217;</p>


<p>Repeating this in the same chapter, in answer to Storch, one of the bourgeois 
  economists, he declared:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;In the first place, it is a false abstraction to regard a nation, whose 
  mode of production is based upon value or otherwise <em>capitalistically organised, 
  </em>as an aggregate body working merely for the satisfaction of the national 
  wants.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;In the second place, after the abolition of the capitalist mode of production, 
  but with social production still in vogue, the <em>detemination of value</em> 
  continues to prevail in such a way that the regulation of the labour time and 
  the distribution of the social labour among the various groups of production 
  also the <em>keeping of accounts </em>in connection with this, becomes <em>more 
  essential than ever</em>.&quot; (<em>Capital, </em>Volume III, page 851, our emphasis)
<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1894-c3/ch49.htm">[source]</a></sup>
</p>


<p>This is in line with the scattered remarks of Marx and Engels at various times 
  in dealing with the transitional period: where Engels explains that under capitalism 
  joint-stock companies and state ownership are beyond the framework, properly 
  speaking, of capitalist production; where Marx already pointed out that credit 
  also extended production beyond its framework <em>even before the transition 
  to the dictatorship of the proletariat. </em>After that, as shown in the above 
  passages and also in the <em>Critique of the Gotha Programme, </em>Marx considered 
  that bourgeois law, bourgeois distribution and in that sense a bourgeois state 
  still remain.</p>


<p>Discussing the role of money and the state in the transitional period, Trotsky 
  developed this idea even further:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;...These two problems, <em>state and money, </em>have a number of traits 
  in common, for they both reduce themselves in the last analysis to the problem 
  of problems: productivity of labour. State compulsion like money compulsion 
  is an inheritance from the class society, which is incapable of defining the 
  relations of man to man except in the form of fetishes, churchly or secular, 
  after appointing to defend them the most alarming of all fetishes, the state, 
  with a great knife between its teeth. In a communist society, the state and 
  money will disappear. Their gradual dying away ought consequently to begin under 
  socialism only at that historical moment when the state turns into a semi-state, 
  and money begins to lose its magic power. This will mean that socialism, having 
  freed itself from capitalist fetishes, is beginning to create a more lucid, 
  free and worthy relation among men. Such characteristically anarchist demands 
  as the &#8216;abolition&#8217; of money, &#8216;abolition&#8217; of wages, or &#8216;liquidation&#8217; of the state 
  and family possess interest merely as models of mechanical thinking. Money cannot 
  be arbitrarily &#8216;abolished&#8217;, nor the state and the old family &#8216;liquidated&#8217;. They 
  have to exhaust their historic mission, evaporate, and fall away. The death-blow 
  to money fetishism will be struck only upon that stage when the steady growth 
  of social wealth has made us bipeds forget our miserly attitude toward every 
  excess minute of labour, and our humiliating fear about the size of our ration. 
  Having lost its ability to bring happiness or trample men in the dust, money 
  will turn into mere book-keeping receipts for the conveniences of statisticians 
  and for planning purposes. In the still more distant future, probably these 
  receipts will not be needed. But we can leave this question entirely to posterity, 
  who will be more intelligent than we are.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The nationalisation of the means of production and credit, the co-operativising 
  or state-ising of internal trade, the monopoly of foreign trade, the collectivisation 
  of agriculture, the law on inheritance - set strict limits upon the personal 
  accumulation of money and hinder its conversion into private capital (usurious, 
  commercial and industrial). These functions of money, however, bound up as they 
  are with exploitation, are not liquidated at the beginning of a proletarian 
  revolution, but in a modified form are transferred to the state, the universal 
  merchant, creditor and industrialist. At the same time the more elementary functions 
  of money, as <em>measure of value</em>, <em>means of exchange </em>and <em>medium 
  of payment</em>, are not only preserved, but acquire a broader field of action 
  than they had under capitalism.&quot; (<em>Revolution Betrayed, </em>page 
  65-6, emphasis in original)<sup><a href="../../trotsky/1936/revbet/ch04.htm#ch04-1">[source]</a></sup>
</p>


<p>To sum up. Whereas before private ownership of the means of production is abolished, 
  the market is dominant over man who is helpless before the laws of the economy 
  he himself has created, after its abolition, he begins for the first time to 
  consciously assert control. But consciousness here merely means the <em>recognition 
  of law, not the abolition of law. </em>That is the peculiarity of the transitional 
  period, that because man now understands the nature of the productive forces, 
  to that extent he can exercise control over them. But he cannot transcend the 
  limits of the given development of the productive forces. However, now that 
  the productive forces have been released from the fetters of individual capitalist 
  production, they can be developed at such a pace and with such expansion that 
  very rapidly they can be transformed from state ownership as an intermediate 
  form, into social ownership by society. Once this stage has been reached (socialism), 
  there is real social production and distribution for the first time. Money withers 
  away, the law of value withers away, the state withers away. In other words, 
  all the forces of constraint which are a necessary reflection of the limits 
  of technique and the development of production at any given stage, now disappear 
  with the disappearance of the division of labour. Until such time, all the features 
  referred to above, capitalist features carried over from the old capitalist 
  society, will linger on in the transitional period.</p>


<p>The position of Comrade Cliff, as with Shachtman and all others who have revised 
  Trotsky&#8217;s position on Russia, remains, on the transitional period, a blank. 
  And for a very good reason. If one considers the theory of the transitional 
  stage in the light of the Russian experience, there are only one of two conclusions: 
  either Russia today is still in a transitional stage, which has taken on horrible 
  distortions, or Russia was never a workers&#8217; state from the very beginning. There 
  are no other alternatives.</p>


<h4>The Marxian Theory of the State. Two Classes One State - Cliff&#8217;s Contradiction</h4>

<p>In the first chapter of his work, Comrade Cliff endeavours to prove that Trotsky&#8217;s 
  analysis of the Russian state contradicts the theory of the state as developed 
  by Marx and elaborated by Lenin.</p>


<p>The first chapter contains an elaborate scheme which sets out to prove that 
  two classes cannot use one state machine. Here Cliff believes he has found a 
  fundamental error in Trotsky. Taking the ideas developed by the Old Man at different 
  times and in differing circumstances, he counterposes them to each other. He 
  counterposes, for example, a quotation from Trotsky in the early stages of the 
  degeneration of the bureaucracy and the expulsion of the Left Opposition, when 
  he argued for the reform of the soviet state, and incidentally, also for the 
  reform of the Bolshevik Party which controlled the state. (It was at this stage 
  that Trotsky wrote the letter to the CC of the CPSU demanding that Stalin be 
  removed.) Who can deny that had the international events developed differently 
  it was theoretically possible that the Bolshevik Party could have spewed forth 
  the bureaucracy and re-established a healthy workers&#8217; state?</p>


<p>Cliff counterposes to this the quotation from <em>Revolution Betrayed</em>, in 
  which Trotsky says that if the Russian workers come to power they will purge 
  the state apparatus; and if the bourgeoisie come to power &#8216;<em>a purgation 
  of the state apparatus would, of course, be necessary in this case too. But 
  a bourgeois restoration would probably have to clean fewer people than a revolutionary 
  party</em>&#8217;. Cliff&#8217;s answer to this is:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Whether we assume that the proletariat must smash the existing state 
  machine on coming to power while the bourgeoisie can use it, or whether we assume 
  that neither the proletariat nor the bourgeoisie can use the existing state 
  apparatus (the &#8216;purgation of the state apparatus&#8217; necessarily involving such 
  a deep change as would transform quantity into quality) - on both assumptions 
  we must come to the conclusion that Russia <em>is not </em>a workers&#8217; state. To 
  assume that the proletariat and the bourgeoisie can use the same state machine 
  as the instrument of their supremacy is tantamount to a vindication of the theoretical 
  basis of social democracy and a repudiation of the revolutionary concept of 
  the state expressed by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky. To assume that different 
  layers, groups or parties of one and the same class cannot base themselves on 
  the same state machine is equally a repudiation of the Marxist concept of the 
  state.&quot; (Cliff, page 4)</p>


<p>This whole formalistic method is the fatal weakness of Cliff&#8217;s case. It would 
  have been impossible for Trotsky in the early stages to deal with the problem 
  in the abstract. He had to deal with the concrete situation and give a concrete 
  answer. But the further degeneration posed the problem in an entirely different 
  way. Once it had been established that it was impossible to reform the Stalinist 
  party, that it was impossible to reform the Soviet state (we assume that Cliff 
  also believes this was the task since up to 1928 since he says Russia <em>was 
  </em>a degenerated workers&#8217; state), then the question had to be viewed in a somewhat 
  different light. It is foreign to the Marxist method to search for isolated 
  contradictions, real or apparent. What is required is an examination of a theory 
  in its broad general development, in its movement, and its contradictions.</p>


<p>But let us examine Cliff&#8217;s own thought processes on this subject. He too cannot 
  avoid the very trap which he tries to lay for Trotsky. Chapter 1 (no less than 
  eighteen pages) <em>is devoted to proving the impossibility of two classes using 
  the one state. </em>But lo and behold, Chapter 4 accomplishes the miracle! The 
  impossible gulf is bridged! <em>Both the capitalist class and the proletariat 
  of Russia have used precisely the same state machine. </em>Why? Because more 
  surplus value was produced! Realising this dilemma, Cliff is compelled to advance 
  something truly new and unique in the movement: that the bureaucracy did not 
  consume surplus value before 1928 but <em>by the introduction of the Five Year 
  Plan, the state was changed </em>from a <em>workers&#8217; state into a capitalist state. 
  </em>(Any enemy of the Fourth International could immediately retort that the 
  state of Stalin on this basis is purely an extension and deepening of the state 
  of Lenin. For in the economic sense nothing fundamentally was changed. We have 
  dealt with this in preceding chapters. Significantly it is only on the <em>economic 
  </em>argument - and this is astonishing - that Cliff advances his theory. Despite 
  the title of his first Chapter &#8216;An Examination of the Definition of Russia as 
  a Degenerated Workers&#8217; State&#8217;, he does not deal with the <em>political </em>question 
  at all here or in any other chapter. Here is how Cliff sees the transformation 
  from a workers&#8217; state into a capitalist state:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The statistics we have at our disposal conclusively show that although 
  the bureaucracy had a privileged position in the period preceding the Five-Year 
  Plan, it can on no account be said that it received surplus value from the labour 
  of others. It can just as conclusively be said that with the introduction of 
  the Five-Year Plans, the bureaucracy&#8217;s income consisted to a large extent of 
  surplus value.&quot; (Cliff, page 45)</p>


<p>In other words, Cliff sees the transition from one system to the other not 
  by smashing of the state machine. How does this fit into his scheme in Chapter 
  1?</p>


<p>Cliff&#8217;s attempt to manufacture an artificial bridge between the workers&#8217; state 
  and the capitalist state, because he has not been able to find the smashing 
  of the workers&#8217; state machine, has led him to seek economic differences between 
  the two periods - pre-1928 and post-1928. In this he falls into the most formalistic 
  and abstract conceptions of the workers&#8217; state prior to 1928. As we have shown 
  in the previous chapters, even in the healthiest of workers&#8217; states, according 
  to Marx, surplus value must necessarily be produced in order to develop industry 
  to the point where the state, money, and the proletariat itself and all the 
  other survivals of capitalism will have disappeared. So long as the working 
  class exists as a class, surplus value will be produced.</p>


<p>A statement of the Left Opposition in 1927 pointed out that the bureaucracy 
  was <em>consuming an enormous part of the surplus value. </em>Cliff&#8217;s method of 
  introducing this subject is totally incorrect. Instead of setting himself the 
  task of proving a thesis, he blandly makes assertions and takes them as proven. 
  That Chapter 4 contradicts everything in Chapter 1 is another matter! Just examine 
  the way in which Comrade Cliff sums up this Chapter 4, in which he openly claims 
  that <em>a transition has been achieved without a revolution and without smashing 
  the state machine.</em></p>


<p>He begins:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;In this chapter we shall describe the transformation of the class character 
  of the Russian state from a workers&#8217; to a capitalist state. We shall do this 
  by dealing with the following points...&quot; (Cliff, page 33)</p>


<p>He thereupon proceeds to detail a number of <em>economic </em>changes which have 
  nothing to do with the structure of or the transformation of <em>state power, 
  </em>and ends up with the subsection: &#8216;Why the Five Year Plan Signifies the Transformation 
  of the Bureaucracy into a Ruling Class.&#8217; All the economic arguments in this 
  chapter have nothing to do with the state or its overthrow.</p>


<p>Cliff deals at length with the differentiation in the army, the introduction 
  of privileges for the officers, military discipline, etc. He here merely repeats 
  what Trotsky said a thousand times on the transformation of the bureaucracy 
  into an uncontrolled caste. But let us see his conclusions. He writes:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Again the Five-Year Plan marks the turning point. Then the organisation 
  and the structure of the army began to change fundamentally. From a workers&#8217; army 
  with bureaucratic deformations it became the armed body of the bureaucracy as 
  the ruling class...&quot; (page 59)</p>


<p>Let us see now whether what excludes a gradual social revolution excludes a 
  gradual counter-revolution.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;If the soldiers in an hierarchically built army strive for decisive control 
  over the army, they immediately meet with the opposition of the officer caste. 
  There is no way of removing such a caste except by revolutionary violence. As 
  against this, if the officers of a people&#8217;s militia become less and less dependent 
  on the will of the soldiers, which they may do as they meet with no institutional 
  bureaucracy, their transformation into an officers&#8217; caste independent of the 
  soldiers can be accomplished gradually. The transition from a standing army 
  to a militia cannot but be accompanied by a tremendous outbreak of revolutionary 
  violence: on the other hand, the transition from a militia to a standing army, 
  to the extent that it is the result of the tendencies inside the militia itself, 
  can and must be gradual. The opposition of the soldiers to the rising bureaucracy 
  may lead the latter to use violence against the soldiers. But this does not 
  exclude the possibility of a gradual transition from a militia to a standing 
  army. <em>What applies to the army applies equally to the state. A state without 
  a bureaucracy, or with a weak bureaucracy dependent on the pressure of the masses 
  may gradually be transformed into a state in which the bureaucracy is free of 
  workers&#8217; control</em>.&quot; (Cliff, page 82, our emphasis)</p>


<p>Cliff now sets out to prove that there can be a gradual transition from a workers&#8217; 
  state to a capitalist state, and clinches his chapter by producing a quotation 
  from none other than Trotsky...whom he has so sternly discredited as an authority 
  on this subject in his Chapter 1.</p>


<p>Cliff writes:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The Moscow Trials<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-5" name="doc-5">(5)</a></sup>
 were the civil war of the bureaucracy 
  against the masses, a war in which only one side was armed and organised. They 
  witnessed the consummation of the bureaucracy&#8217;s total liberation from popular 
  control. Trotsky, who thought that the Moscow trials and the &#8216;Constitution&#8217; 
  were steps towards the restoration of individual capitalism by legal means, 
  then withdrew the argument that a gradual change from a proletarian to a bourgeois 
  state is &#8216;running backwards the film of reformism&#8217;. He wrote:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;&#8217;In reality, the <em>new constitution</em>...opens up for the bureaucracy 
  &quot;legal&quot; roads for the economic counter-revolution, ie, the restoration 
  of capitalism by means of a &quot;Cold stroke&quot;.&#8217; (<em>Fourth International 
  and the Soviet Union</em>, Thesis adopted by the First International Conference 
  for the Fourth International, Geneva, July 1936.)&quot; (Cliff, page 82)</p>


<p>Here we see the full light on Cliff&#8217;s thesis and his bad method. Starting off 
  with the thesis that Trotsky is no Marxist because he says two classes can use 
  one state machine, Cliff ends up saying precisely the same thing and using as 
  his authority the same Trotsky.</p>


<h4>Nationalisation and the Workers&#8217; State</h4>

<p>On page 2 of his work, Cliff gives a quotation from <em>Revolution Betrayed</em>:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The nationalisation of the land, the means of industrial production, 
  transport and exchange, together with the monopoly of foreign trade, constitutes 
  the basis of the Soviet social structure. Through these relations, established 
  by the proletarian revolution, the nature of the Soviet Union as a proletarian 
  state is for us basically defined.&quot; (<em>Revolution Betrayed</em>, page 248)
<sup><a href="../../trotsky/1936/revbet/ch09.htm#ch09-2">[source]</a></sup></p>


<p>One of Cliff&#8217;s conclusions is that, in this case, &#8216;neither the Paris Commune 
  nor the Bolshevik dictatorship were workers&#8217; states as the former did not statify 
  the means of production at all, and the latter did not do so for some time.&#8217; 
  Here we see that Cliff bases his case on whether or not the working class has 
  control over the state machine. We will deal with the question of workers&#8217; control 
  in a later chapter. But here let us examine Cliff&#8217;s method of separating the 
  economic basis of a workers&#8217; state from the question of workers&#8217; control of 
  the state machine. For a temporary period, for shorter or longer duration, it 
  would be possible for the proletariat to take power politically while not proceeding 
  economically to transform society. This was the position in Russia where the 
  proletariat took power in October 1917, but did not undertake major nationalisation 
  until it was forced upon them in 1918. But if the proletariat did not proceed 
  to carry through the economic transformation, then inevitably the proletarian 
  regime would be doomed to collapse. The laws of the economy will always break 
  through in the end. Either the proletariat would proceed to nationalise the 
  entire economy, or inevitably the capitalist system would emerge predominant. 
  <em>Cliff fails to show how the basic forms of Russian economy would differ under 
  a healthy workers&#8217; state. </em>He has taken refuge in the surplus value consumed 
  by the bureaucracy, but this evades the fundamental issue.</p>


<p>No better is Cliff&#8217;s case based upon the experience of the Paris Commune and 
  the first stage of the Russian Revolution. The same would apply to them as aforementioned. 
  These regimes were a transition to the complete <em>economic </em>rule of the 
  proletariat. Such transitions are more or less inevitable in the change over 
  from one society to another. Both in the case of the Commune and in the case 
  of the Russian Revolution, they could not be long lasting if the proletariat 
  did not proceed to nationalise industry. Has Cliff forgotten that one of the 
  main lessons taught by Marx and assiduously learned by the Bolsheviks, was the 
  failure of the French proletariat to nationalise the Bank of France? So we see 
  a state can be a proletarian state on the basis of political power, or it can 
  be a proletarian state on the basis of the economy; or it can be a transition 
  to <em>both </em>of these as we will show.</p>


<p>The same laws would apply to the counter-revolution on the part of the bourgeoisie. 
  The Old Man correctly argued that in the event of a bourgeois counter-revolution 
  in Russia, the bourgeoisie might, for a time, even retain state ownership before 
  breaking it up and handing it to private ownership. To a scholar it would appear 
  then that you can have a workers&#8217; state and a bourgeois state on the basis of 
  state ownership, or you can have a workers&#8217; state or a bourgeois state on the 
  basis of private ownership.</p>


<p>However, it is obvious that one could only arrive at this mode of reasoning 
  if one failed to take into consideration <em>the movement of society </em>in one 
  direction or another.</p>


<p>Not only that, but all sorts of unforeseen relationships can develop because 
  of the class structure of society and the state. To take the example of Russia. 
  In 1917 up to the capture of control of the soviets by the Bolsheviks, we had 
  the situation as sketched by Trotsky in the <em>History of the Russian Revolution, 
  </em>where, because of the Menshevik majority, in a certain sense the bourgeoisie 
  ruled through the soviets - the organs of workers&#8217; rule <em>par excellence</em>! 
  According to Cliff&#8217;s schema, how could this possibly happen? Of course, 
  had the Bolsheviks not taken power, the bourgeoisie, having used the Mensheviks 
  and through them, the soviets in the transitional period, would have abolished 
  the soviets as they did in Germany after 1918.</p>


<p>In the transition from one society to another, it is clear that there is not 
  an unbridgeable gulf. It is not a dialectical method to think in finished categories; 
  workers&#8217; state or capitalist state and the devil take any transition or motion 
  between the two. It is clear that when Marx spoke of the smashing of the old 
  state form in relation to the Commune, he took it for granted that the economy 
  would be transformed at a greater or lesser pace and would come into consonance 
  with the political forms. We will see later in relation to Eastern Europe that 
  Cliff adopts the same formalistic method.</p>


<h4>The Dialectical Conception of the State</h4>

<p>It may be well to deal here with the nature of the state. According to Marxists, 
  the state arises as the necessary instrument for the oppression of one class 
  by another class. The state in the last analysis, as explained by Marx and Lenin, 
  consists of armed bodies of men and their appendages. That is the essence of 
  the Marxist definition. However, one must be careful in using their broad Marxist 
  generalisations, which are undoubtedly correct, in an absolute sense. Truth 
  is always concrete but if one does not analyse the particular ramifications 
  and concrete circumstances, one must inevitably fall into abstractions and errors. 
  Look at the cautious way in which Engels deals with the question, even when 
  generalising. In <em>Origins of the Family, </em>Engels wrote:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;But in order that these antagonisms, classes with conflicting economic 
  interests, shall not consume themselves and society in fruitless struggle, a 
  power, apparently standing above society, has become necessary to moderate the 
  conflict and keep it within the bounds of &#8216;order&#8217;, and this power, arisen out 
  of society, but placing itself above it and increasingly alienating itself from 
  it, is the state.&quot; (<em>The Origin of the Family</em>, Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 
  London, 1946, page 194)
<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch09.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>


<p>On the next page he goes on to show that:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;...it is enough to look at Europe today, where class struggle and 
  rivalry in conquest have brought the public power to a pitch where it threatens 
  to devour the whole of society and even the state itself.&quot;</p>


<p>Engels goes on to show that once having arisen, the state <em>within certain 
  </em>limits, develops an independent movement of its own and must necessarily 
  do so under given conditions: &quot;In possession of the public power and the right 
  of taxation, the officials now present themselves as organs of society standing 
  <em>above </em>society.&quot; (Emphasis in original)
<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch09.htm">[source]</a></sup>
</p>


<p>Contrary to Cliff&#8217;s conception that the state plays a direct role, one can 
  see the meticulous care with which Engels treats the question of the <em>independent 
  </em>role of the state, relative of course, to society. In the whole of Cliff&#8217;s 
  material, the fact that the state under given conditions can and does play a 
  relatively independent role in the struggle between the classes is forgotten. 
  His is a &#8216;logical&#8217; scheme: either it is a state of workers, directly controlled 
  by the workers, or it must be a capitalist state. There is no room for the interplay 
  of forces in Cliff&#8217;s method. Again, contrast this with Engels:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;As the state arose from the need to keep class antagonisms in check, 
  but also arose in the thick of the fight between the classes, <em>it is normally</em> 
  the state of the most powerful, economically ruling class, which by its means 
  becomes also the political ruling class, and so acquires new means of holding 
  down and exploiting the oppressed class...Exceptional periods, however, occur 
  when the warring classes are so nearly equal in forces that the state power, 
  as apparent mediator, acquires for the moment a certain independence in relation 
  to both...&quot; (page 196, our emphasis)
<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch09.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>


<p>Again, on page 201, Engels wrote:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The central link in civilised society is the state, which in <em>all typical 
  periods </em>(our emphasis) is without exception the state of the ruling class, 
  and in all cases continues to be essentially a machine for holding down the 
  oppressed, exploited class...&quot;
<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch09.htm">[source]</a></sup>
</p>


<p>Note the difference between Cliff&#8217;s black and white formulae and Engels&#8217; careful 
  formulations...&#8217;it is normally&#8217;, in &#8216;typical periods&#8217;, etc.</p>


<p>Why is it that the proletariat cannot take over the ready made state machine? 
  Not for mystical reasons but because of certain very concrete facts. In the 
  modern state all the key positions are in the hands of those people who are 
  under the control of the ruling class: they have been specially selected by 
  education, outlook, and conditions of life, to serve the interests of the bourgeoisie. 
  The army officers, particularly the higher ranks, the civil servants, and in 
  the nationalised industries today the key technicians, are moulded in their 
  ideas and outlook to serve the interests of the capitalist class. All the commanding 
  positions in society are placed in the hands of people whom the bourgeoisie 
  can trust. That is the reason the state machine is a tool in the hands of the 
  bourgeoisie which cannot be used by the proletariat and must be smashed by them. 
  Now, what does the smashing of the state machine mean? To say the least, Cliff&#8217;s 
  ideas on this question appear to be very nebulous.</p>


<p>It is possible that many, perhaps even the majority of the officials of the 
  bourgeois state, will be used by the proletariat once they take power. But they 
  will be subordinate to the workers&#8217; committees and organisations. For example 
  in the Soviet Union, in the early days after the Czarist army had been dissolved, 
  the Red Army was led by ex-Czarist officers. Likewise in the state apparatus 
  where a proportion of the officials were the same ex-Czarist officials. Because 
  of unfavourable historical factors this was later to play an important role 
  in the degeneration of the Russian regime. Not for nothing did Lenin say that 
  the Soviet state is &#8216;a bourgeois Czarist machine...barely varnished with 
  socialism&#8217;. (Incidentally this honest characterisation is very far from the 
  idealised and false picture of the state under Lenin and Trotsky which is drawn 
  by Cliff. How the process of degeneration could have taken place with the idyllic 
  picture painted by Cliff would be difficult to understand. However, this will 
  be dealt with in the later sections.)</p>


<p>The proletariat, according to the classical concept, smashes the old state 
  machine and proceeds to create a <em>semi-state</em>. Nevertheless, it is forced 
  to utilise the old technicians. But the state, even under the best conditions, 
  say in an advanced country with an educated proletariat, remains a bourgeois 
  instrument, and because of this the possibility of degeneration is implicit 
  in it. For that reason Marxists insist on the control of the masses, to ensure 
  that the state should not be allowed to develop into an independent force. As 
  speedily as possible, it should be dissolved into society.</p>


<p>It is for the very reasons given above that, under certain conditions, the 
  state gains a certain independence from the base which it originally represented. 
  Engels explained that though the superstructure is dependent on the economic 
  base, it nevertheless has an independent movement of its own. For quite a lengthy 
  period, <em>there can be a conflict between the state and the class which that 
  state represents. </em>That is why Engels speaks of the state &#8216;normally&#8217; or in 
  &#8216;typical periods&#8217; directly representing the ruling class. The great Marxist 
  teachers have analysed the phenomenon of Bonapartism to which Engels refers 
  above. In the <em>Eighteenth Brumaire </em>Marx pointed out how the drunken soldiery 
  of Louis Napoleon, in the name of &#8216;the law, order and the family&#8217;, <em>shot down 
  the bourgeoisie whom they presumably represented.</em>
<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch07.htm">[source]</a></sup>
</p>


<p>Thus, one can only understand class society if one takes into account the many-sided 
  dialectical inter-dependence and antagonisms of all the factors within it. Formalists 
  usually get lost in one or other side of the problem. For example, Cliff can 
  write:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;...It needs just as high a degree of mental acrobatics to think that 
  Mikolajcik<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-6" name="doc-6">(6)</a></sup> and his ilk who flee abroad or waste away 
  in prisons are the rulers of Poland as to consider that the rulers of Russia 
  are the slave labourers in Siberia.&quot; (Cliff, page 13)</p>


<p>Were the bourgeoisie under Louis Napoleon the ruling class? It needs no high 
  degree of mental acrobatics to answer this.</p>


<p>When considering the development of society, <em>economics must be considered 
  the dominant factor. </em>The super-structure which develops on this economic 
  base separates itself from the base and becomes antagonistic to it. After all, 
  the essence of the Marxist theory of revolution is that with the gradual changes 
  in production under the embryo of the old form, ie, super-structure in both 
  property and state, a contradiction develops which can only be resolved by abolishing 
  the super-structure and re-organising society on the base of the new mode of 
  production which has developed within the old.</p>


<p>Economy in the long run is decisive. Because of this, as all the Marxist teachers 
  were at pains to explain, in the long run the superstructure must come into 
  correspondence with it. Once having abandoned the criterion of the basic economic 
  structure of society, all sorts of superficial and arbitrary constructions are 
  possible. One would inevitably be lost in the maze of history, like Perseus 
  in the mythology of ancient Greece who was lost in the Palace of mines, but 
  without a thread to lead one out. The thread of history is the basic economic 
  structure of society, or the property form, its legal reflection.</p>


<p>Let us take as a case extremely rich in examples, the history of France. The 
  bourgeois revolution took place in 1789. In 1793 the Jacobins<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-7" name="doc-7">(7)</a></sup> 
  seized complete power. As Marx and Engels pointed out, they went beyond the 
  framework of bourgeois relations and performed a salutary historical task because 
  of that, accomplishing in a few months what would have taken the bourgeoisie 
  decades or generations to accomplish; the complete cleansing from France of 
  all traces of feudalism. Yet this regime remained rooted in the basis of bourgeois 
  forms of property. It was followed by the French Thermidor and the rule of the 
  Directory, to be followed by the classic dictatorship of Napoleon Bonaparte. 
  Napoleon re-introduced many feudal forms, had himself crowned Emperor and concentrated 
  the supreme power in his hands. But we still call this regime bourgeois. With 
  the restoration of Louis XVIII the regime still remained capitalist...and 
  then we had not one but <em>two revolutions - </em>1830 and 1848. These revolutions 
  had important social consequences. They resulted in significant changes even 
  in the personnel of the state itself. Yet we characterise them both as bourgeois 
  revolutions in which there was no change in the class which held power.</p>


<p>Let us proceed further. After the Paris Commune of 1871 and the shake-up of 
  the relations which this involved, we had the organisation of the Third Republic 
  with bourgeois democracy which lasted for decades. This was followed by Petain, 
  then the De Gaulle-Stalinist regime<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-8" name="doc-8">(8)</a></sup>, and now the Quielle 
  Government. Examine for a moment the amazing diversity of these regimes. To 
  a non-Marxist it would seem absurd to define in the same category, shall we 
  say, the regime of Robespierre and that of Petain. Yet Marxists do define them 
  as fundamentally the same - bourgeois regimes. What is the criterion? Only the 
  one thing: the form of property, the private ownership of the means of production.</p>


<p>Take, similarly, the diversity of regimes in more modern times to see the extreme 
  differences in super-structures which are on the same economic base. For instance, 
  compare the regime of nazi Germany with that of British social democracy. They 
  are so fundamentally different in super-structure that many theorists of the 
  non-Marxist or ex-Marxist school have found new class structure and a new system 
  of society entirely. Why do we say that they represent the same class and the 
  same regime? Despite the difference in super-structure, <em>the economic base 
  of the given societies remained the same.</em></p>


<p>If we take the history of modern society, we get many examples where the bourgeoisie 
  is <em>expropriated politically </em>and yet remains the ruling class. Trotsky 
  describes the regime of Bonapartism, or as Marx calls it, &#8216;naked rule by the 
  sword over society&#8217;.</p>


<p>Look what happened in China after Chiang Kai Shek had, with the dregs of the 
  Shanghai gangs, crushed the Shanghai working class. The bankers wished to give 
  him banquets and applaud him as the benefactor and saviour of civilisation.</p>


<p>But Chiang wanted something more material than the praise of his masters. Unceremoniously, 
  he clapped all the rich industrialists and bankers of Shanghai in jail and extracted 
  a ransom of millions before he would release them. He had done the job for them 
  and now demanded the price. He had not crushed the Shanghai workers for the 
  benefit of the capitalists, but for what it meant in power and income for him 
  and his gang of thugs. Yet who will presume to say that the bankers who were 
  in jail were not still the ruling class though they did not hold political power? 
  The Chinese bourgeoisie (no Marxists!) must have reflected sadly on the complexity 
  of society where a good portion of the loot in the surplus value extracted from 
  the workers had to go to their own watchdogs, and where many of their class 
  were languishing in jail.</p>


<p>The bourgeoisie is politically expropriated under such conditions; naked force 
  dominates society. An enormous part of the surplus value is consumed by the 
  top militarists and bureaucrats. But it is in the interests of these bureaucrats 
  that the capitalist exploitation of the workers should continue, and therefore 
  while they squeeze as much as they can out of the bourgeoisie, nevertheless, 
  they defend private property. That is why the bourgeoisie continues to be the 
  ruling class.</p>


<p>Here lies the anwer to those who assert that it is sheer sophistry to claim 
  that a working class can be a ruling class when a great proportion of them are 
  in jail in Siberia. Unless we are guided by the basic property forms of society 
  we will lose the Marxist road. Many examples could be given in history of the 
  way in which one section of the ruling class has attacked other sections. For 
  example, in the Wars of the Roses in Britain the two factions of the ruling 
  barons virtually exterminated one another. At one time or another in history 
  big sections of the ruling class were either in jails or were executed. One 
  has only to consider Hitler&#8217;s treatment of his bourgeois opponents. They lost 
  not only their property but their lives as well.</p>


<p>In dealing with the role of the state, the most important question that must 
  be answered and one which Cliff cannot answer is: the state must be an instrument 
  of a class - which class does it represent in Russia and Eastern Europe? It 
  cannot represent the capitalist class because they have been expropriated. It 
  cannot be argued that it represents the interests of the peasant class, or the 
  petty-owners in the cities. Under a fascist or Bonapartist regime, even though 
  the gangsters might have the bourgeoisie by the throat, nevertheless there is 
  a capitalist class in whose interests the economy operates as a whole, and on 
  whom this parasitic excrescence clings. If they do not represent the proletariat, 
  as Trotsky said, as a special form of Bonapartism in the sense that they defend 
  the nationalisation of the means of production, planning and the monopoly of 
  foreign trade, whom do the Stalinist bureaucrats represent? Cliff&#8217;s answer is 
  that the bureaucracy constitutes the new ruling class, the capitalist class 
  of Russia. But serious consideration of this would show that this cannot be 
  the case. What he is saying is that the <em>state is a class. </em>The bureaucracy 
  owns the state, the state owns the means of production, therefore the bureaucracy 
  is a class. This is dodging the issue, he is saying in effect that the state 
  owns the state.</p>


<p>According to Lenin, the state:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;...has always been a certain apparatus which separated out from society 
  and consisted of a group of people engaged solely, or almost solely, or mainly, 
  in ruling. People are divided into ruled and into specialists in ruling, those 
  who rise above society and are called rulers, representatives of the state.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;This apparatus, this group of people who rule others, always takes command 
  of a certain apparatus of coercion, of physical force, irrespective of whether 
  this coercion of people is expressed in the primitive club or - in the epoch 
  of slavery - in more perfected types of weapons, or in the firearms which appeared 
  in the middle ages or, finally, in modern weapons which, in the twentieth century, 
  are marvels of technique and are entirely based on the latest achievements of 
  modern technology.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The methods of coercion changed, but whenever there was a state there 
  existed in every society a group of persons who ruled, who commanded, who dominated 
  and who, in order to maintain their power, possessed an apparatus of physical 
  coercion, an apparatus of violence, with those weapons which corresponded best 
  to the technical level of the given epoch. And by examining these general phenomena, 
  by asking ourselves why no state existed when there were no classes, when there 
  were no exploiters and no exploited, and why it arose when classes arose - only 
  in this way shall we find a definite answer to the question of the essence of 
  the state and its significance.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The state is a machine for maintaining the rule of one class over another.&quot; 
  (<em>The State</em>, Collected Works, Volume 29, page 477)
<sup><a href="../../lenin/works/1919/jul/11.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>


<p>The state by its very nature is composed of bureaucracy, officers, generals, 
  heads of police etc. <em>But these do not constitute a class; </em>they are the 
  instrument of a class even if they may be in antagonism to that class. They 
  cannot themselves be a class.</p>


<p>We must ask Cliff: Which section of the bureaucracy owns the state? It cannot 
  be all the bureaucrats, because they, the bureaucracy itself, are hierarchically 
  divided. The little civil servant is part of the bureaucracy as much as the 
  big bureaucrat. Is it then the commanding stratum in Soviet society? This is 
  clearly unsound. In capitalist society, or in any class society, no matter how 
  privileged the top, they wield the instrument to protect the ruling class which 
  has a direct relationship to the means of production, ie, in the sense of their 
  ownership. We know who Napoleon represented. We know who Louis Napoleon, Bismarck, 
  Chiang Kai Shek, Hitler, Churchill and Attlee represented. But who do the bureaucrats 
  represent: the bureaucrats? Clearly this is false. In another section we have 
  shown that the relationship of the bureaucracy to the means of production is 
  necessarily one of <em>parasitism </em>and partakes of the same parasitism as 
  the nazi bureaucracy. They are not a necessary and inevitable category for the 
  particular <em>mode of production. </em>At best they are entitled to wages of 
  superintendence. If they take more, it is in the same way as the nazi bureaucracy 
  consumed part of the surplus value produced by the workers. But they were not 
  a class.</p>


<p>Innumerable references could be given to show that a capitalist state presupposes 
  private property, individual ownership of the means of production. The state 
  is the <em>apparatus of </em>rule: it cannot itself be the class which rules. 
  The bureaucracy is merely part of the apparatus of the state. It may &#8216;own&#8217; the 
  state, in the sense that it lifts itself above society and becomes relatively 
  independent of the economically dominant, ie, ruling class. That was the case 
  in nazi Germany, where the bureaucracy dictated to the capitalists what they 
  should produce, how they should produce it, etc, for the purposes of war. So 
  in the war economy of Britain, USA and elsewhere, the state dictated to the 
  capitalists what and how they should produce. This did not convert them into 
  a ruling class. Why? Because it was in defence of private property.</p>


<p>Cliff argues that the bureaucracy manages and plans industry. True enough. 
  Whose industry do they manage and plan? In capitalist society, the managers 
  plan and manage industry in the individual enterprises and trusts. But it does 
  not make them the owners of those enterprises and trusts. The bureaucracy manages 
  the entire industry. In that sense it is true that it has more independence 
  from its economic base than any other bureaucracy or state machine in the whole 
  of human history. But as Engels emphasised and we must re-emphasise, in the 
  final analysis the economic basis is decisive. If Cliff is going to argue that 
  it is in their function as managers that the bureaucrats are the ruling class, 
  then clearly he is not giving a Marxist definition of a capitalist class. He 
  is calling the Russian bureaucracy a class, but he must work out a theory as 
  to what class this is.</p>


<p>The state is the instrument of class rule, of coercion, a glorified policeman. 
  But the policeman is not the ruling class. The police can become unbridled, 
  can become bandits, but that does not convert them into a capitalist, feudal 
  or slave-owning class.</p>


<h4>What Happened in Eastern Europe</h4>

<p>Events in Eastern Europe and the nature of the states which have arisen can 
  only be explained by the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state, and only Trotsky&#8217;s 
  conceptions can explain events in Eastern Europe from this point of view.</p>


<p>First it is necessary to understand what took place in Eastern Europe with 
  the advance of the Red Army. No one can deny (leaving aside the question of 
  Germany for a moment) that in all the Balkan and Eastern European countries 
  the advance of the Red Army resulted in a revolutionary movement not only among 
  the workers, but among the peasants as well. The reason for this lay in the 
  whole background of these states, where, before the war, apart from Czechoslovakia, 
  capitalism was very weak. We had here decaying feudal-military-capitalist dictatorships 
  whose regimes were completely incapable of further developing the productive 
  forces of the countries.</p>


<p>The general world crisis of capitalism was particularly exacerbated because 
  of the backwardness and the artifical splitting up of the area which had followed 
  the first world war. The very term <em>Balkanisation </em>comes from this part 
  of Europe. Split up into small weak states, overwhelmingly agrarian in character, 
  with a very shaky industry, these areas inevitably became almost semi-colonies 
  of the great powers. France, Britain, and to a certain extent Italy, then Germany, 
  became the dominant powers of this area. Through her trade relations, German 
  industry dominated the backward economies of Eastern Europe in the Balkans. 
  In all these countries foreign capital played an important role. In most of 
  them, foreign investments were dominant in what little industry existed.</p>


<p>With the occupation of these countries by Hitler, not only was &#8216;non-Aryan&#8217; 
  capital expropriated, but also the native capitalists were to a large extent 
  squeezed out and replaced by German banks and trusts. German capital seized 
  the decisive place - all the key positions and sections of the economy. The 
  capital that remained was owned by collaborators and Quislings largely, and 
  remained subordinate to German capital.</p>


<p>The regime was made up of Quislings who relied on German bayonets for their 
  support. What little popular support was possessed by the pre-war regimes - 
  military police dictatorships had, in the course of the war, disappeared. With 
  the collapse of the power of German imperialism and the victory of the Red Army, 
  an undoubted impulse was given to the socialist revolution. In Bulgaria, for 
  example, in 1944, the moment the Red Army had crossed the frontier, there was 
  an uprising in Sofia and other big towns. The masses began the organisation 
  of soviets or workers&#8217; committees. Soldiers and peasants organised committees 
  and workers seized the factories.</p>


<p>Similar movements took place in all the countries of Eastern Europe, apart 
  from Germany. Let us examine what happened in Czechoslovakia. Here too, the 
  advance of the Red Army was followed by insurrection in Prague, the seizure 
  of factories by workers and land by peasants. Here too, there was fraternisation 
  on the borders of Bohemia and Moravia between the Czech and Sudetan-German masses.</p>


<p>The elements of proletarian revolution were quickly followed by Stalinist counter-revolution. 
  The trouble with Cliff is that he fails to separate out the elements of the 
  proletarian revolution from the Stalinist counter-revolution which rapidly followed.</p>


<p>Let us take the two examples: Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. In Bulgaria we had 
  a situation which has developed over and over again throughout the tragic history 
  of the working masses. The real power was in the hands of the working class. 
  The bourgeois state was smashed. How? The Germans had gone; the officers no 
  longer had control over the soldiers; the police had gone into hiding; the landlords 
  and capitalists had no control. There was a vacuum; a classical period of dual 
  power where the masses were not sufficiently conscious to organise their own 
  power, and the bourgeoisie too weak to reassert their domination.</p>


<p>This is not a situation with which Marxists are unfamiliar: Germany 1918, Russia 
  1917, Spain 1936. Perhaps a comparison with Spain would be useful. Here too 
  the masses seized the factories and the land in Catalonia and Aragon. The bourgeois 
  &#8216;government&#8217; was suspended in mid-air. The masses completely smashed the police 
  and the army. There was only one armed force: the workers&#8217; militias. All that 
  was necessary was for the masses to organise soviets or committees, brush aside 
  the phantom government and take power.</p>


<p>It is well enough known what took place. The Stalinists proceeded to make a 
  coalition not with the bourgeoisie - the factory owners and bourgeoisie had 
  fled to the side of Franco as a consequence of the mass insurrection - but with 
  the &#8216;shadow of the bourgeoisie&#8217;. The Stalinists did this in Spain with the express 
  purpose of destroying the socialist revolution for fear of repercussions in 
  Russia and, of course, because of the existing international line-up and their 
  desire to demonstrate to the British and French imperialists that they had nothing 
  to fear. In Spain, therefore, gradually, they helped the shadow to acquire substance.</p>


<p>Gradually <em>they recreated a capitalist army and capitalist police force, 
  under the control of the capitalist class. </em>Once this had been accomplished, 
  the land was returned to the landlords and the factories to their owners. The 
  consequence of this was seen towards the end of the civil war when the bourgeois 
  state - the bourgeois military machine which they had helped to create, organised 
  a <em>coup d&#8217;etat </em>which established a military dictatorship in Republican 
  territory and promptly illegalised the Communist Party itself.</p>


<p>In Bulgaria, as in all other countries of Eastern Europe, the Stalinists proceeded 
  to make an agreement with the <em>shadow of the bourgeoisie. </em>The socialist 
  revolution had commenced and there was a danger that it might be carried through 
  to a conclusion. This, of course, the Stalinists feared. But on the other hand, 
  <em>they also did not want the power to pass to the bourgeoisie. </em>They derailed 
  the socialist revolution by organising the so-called Fatherland Front in Bulgaria 
  and headed off the movement of the masses round slogans of chauvinism and anti-Germanism. 
  Fraternisation in Bulgaria was swiftly made punishable, the soviets formed in 
  the army were dissolved, the worker and peasant committees emasculated. They 
  formed a front of &#8216;National Unity&#8217;, the union of the entire nation. But the 
  difference with Spain was that here <em>the key positions in this so-called coalition, 
  </em>where the shadow of the bourgeoisie possessed no power, <em>remained firmly
  in Stalinist hands. </em>They took over the police and the army. They selected 
  the key and commanding personnel. All important positions in the civil service 
  were placed in the hands of obedient tools. Clearly, behind the screen of national 
  unity, they concentrated real state power in their hands. <em>They had created 
  an instrument in their own image - a state machine on the model of Moscow.</em></p>


<p>The process was crystal clear in the case of Czechoslovakia. When the Stalinists 
  entered the country there was no government. The Germans with their Quislings 
  and collaborators had fled. The committees formed by the masses had control 
  of the industrial enterprises and the land. The Stalinists brought in the government 
  of Benes<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-9" name="doc-9">(9)</a></sup> from Moscow. The real power, the key posts, 
  were firmly in their hands; they retained the substance and gave the bourgeoisie 
  the shadow.</p>


<p>Partly to destroy the socialist revolution, partly to arrive at a compromise 
  with American imperialism, they allowed certain sectors of the economy to remain 
  in the hands of private enterprise. But the decisive power, ie, armed bodies 
  of men, were organised by them and under their control. This was not the same 
  state machine as previously. <em>It was an entirely new state machine of their 
  own creation.</em></p>


<p>In order to derail the revolution the Stalinists played on chauvinism and dealt 
  the country a terrible blow with the expulsion of the Sudetan Germans. The original 
  instinct of the masses was on internationalist lines. Reports from Czechoslovakia 
  show that in the beginning there was fraternisation between the Czechs and Sudetan 
  Germans. We see how Cliff does not see the element of the counter-revolution, 
  the activities of the bureaucracy to destroy the revolution and the revolution 
  itself.</p>


<p>Of course, the attempt of the Stalinists to maintain a compromise with the 
  bourgeoisie - let it not be forgotten with their control and their state power 
  - could not continue indefinitely. Shadows can acquire substance. The attempt 
  of the American bourgeoisie to base themselves on their points of support in 
  Eastern Europe in the shape of the remnants of the bourgeoisie and those sectors 
  of the economy which they controlled, with Marshall Aid as the wedge, was the 
  danger signal. With precipitous speed the bureaucracy acted and ordered all 
  Eastern European states to reject Marshall Aid. All history has shown the impossibility 
  of maintaining two antagonistic forms of property. Although the bourgeoisie 
  were very weak, they had begun to gain a base due to the fact that they retained 
  a good proportion of light industry under their control. The mounting antagonism 
  of America, the impossibility of relying on the bourgeoisie, their incompatibility 
  with a proletarian state with power in the hands of the bureaucracy, forced 
  the latter to take measures to complete the process. Here we might add that 
  Trotsky saw in the extension of nationalised property in the areas under Stalinist 
  domination, proof of the fact that Russia was a workers&#8217; state. The February 
  events on which world attention has been focused, highlighted in dramatic fashion, 
  a process taking place in all Stalinist dominated areas. The factor which was 
  decisive was that the Stalinists had the support of the workers and peasants 
  in the nationalisations and the division of the land. All Cliff saw was that 
  the state machine remained the same, presumably, as it was under the Germans. 
  No doubt the bourgeoisie wished that it had!</p>


<p>According to all observers the Stalinists, because of their compromises and 
  the disillusionment of the masses in the factories, would probably have lost 
  votes in the forthcoming elections. The bourgeois elements were gathering strength, 
  basing themselves on the petty bourgeoisie in the cities and among disillusioned 
  workers and peasants. Gradually the bourgeoisie hoped to gain control of the 
  state and organise a counter-revolution with the aid of Anglo-American imperialism. 
  Although the bureaucracy had control of the state machine, this was precarious 
  by virtue of the way in which it had been obtained.</p>


<p>In order to complete the process, as Trotsky had foreseen, however cautiously, 
  the bureaucracy was compelled <em>to call upon the masses. </em>They issued the 
  call for Action Committees which were bureaucratically controlled at the top, 
  but were nevertheless relatively democratic at the bottom. The Stalinists armed 
  the workers, ie, organised a workers&#8217; militia. The enthusiasm of the masses 
  under these conditions, naturally became apparent. Even the Social Democratic 
  workers who hated and were distrustful of the Stalinists, enthusiastically participated 
  in these measures against the bourgeoisie. Trotsky once said that as against 
  a lion one used a gun, against a flea one&#8217;s fingernail. Faced with a Stalinist 
  state apparatus, with the mass movement as a threat, the bourgeoisie was impotent.</p>


<p>However, the formation of the Action Committees, the arming of the workers, 
  meant necessarily that an embryo new soviet regime was in the making. Of course, 
  the bureaucracy speedily proceeded to crush the independence of the masses and 
  totalitarianise the regime. New elections were rapidly organised on Moscow lines, 
  with one list and strict supervision.</p>


<p>In the face of these events, Cliff asks:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;What then is the future of the Fourth International; what is its historical 
  justification? The Stalinist parties have all the advantages over the Fourth 
  International - a state apparatus, mass organisations, money, etc, etc. The 
  only advantage they lack is the internationalist class ideology...</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;If a social revolution took place in the Eastern European countries without 
  a revolutionary proletarian leadership, we must conclude that in future social 
  revolutions, as in the past, the masses will do the fighting but not the leading. 
  In all the struggles of the bourgeoisie, it was not the bourgeoisie itself who 
  did the fighting, but the masses who believed it was in their interests. The 
  <em>sans culottes </em>of the French revolution fought for liberty, equality, 
  fraternity, while the real aim of the movement was the establishment of the 
  rule of the bourgeoisie. This was the case at a time when the bourgeoisie was 
  progressive. In reactionary imperialist wars, the less the masses who are the 
  cannon fodder know about the war aims, the better soldiers they are. To assume 
  that the &#8216;new democracies&#8217; are workers&#8217; states, means to accept that in principle 
  the proletarian revolution is, just as the bourgeois wars were, based on the 
  deception of the people...</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;If these countries are workers&#8217; states, then why Marxism, why the Fourth 
  International? We could only be looked upon by the masses as adventurists, or 
  at best impatient revolutionaries whose differences with the Stalinists are 
  merely tactical.&quot; (Cliff, pages 14-15)</p>


<p>Cliff has addressed the questions to the wrong people. In reality, he should 
  have posed these questions to himself and he should have given the answers. 
  If his theory is correct, then the whole theory of Marx becomes a Utopia. Cliff 
  thinks that if he sticks the label &#8216;state capitalism&#8217; on to the phenomenon of 
  Stalinism, he has salved his conscience and has restored the &#8216;lost&#8217; role of 
  the Fourth International to his own satisfaction. Here we see the fetishism 
  of which Marx spoke and which even affects the revolutionary movement: change 
  the name of a thing and you change its essence.</p>


<p>It is not possible to explain or trace the class historical threads of present 
  day developments without the existence and degeneration of the workers&#8217; state 
  in Russia. One can only trace the events in Eastern Europe to the October Revolution 
  of 1917. It is useless for Cliff to argue that the bureaucracy used the masses 
  in Czechoslovakia, without posing to himself the question as to who was used 
  in 1917. Was not the October Revolution followed by the victory of Stalinism? 
  The good intentions, or the subjective wishes of the Bolshevik leadership or 
  the working class, is beside the point. According to the theory of Marx, no 
  society passes from the scene till it has exhausted all the potentialities within 
  it. If a new period of state capitalism looms ahead - and this necessarily follows 
  from Cliff&#8217;s theory because there can be no economic limit to the development 
  of production under this so-called state capitalism then to talk of this being 
  a period of the disintegration of world capitalism reduces itself to mere phrasemongering. 
  We have the absurdity of a new revolution - a proletarian revolution in 1917, 
  organically changing the economy into ... state capitalism. We also have the 
  no less absurd postulation of a revolution in Eastern Europe, where the entire 
  capitalist class has been expropriated...to install what? Capitalism! A moment&#8217;s 
  serious reflection would show that it is not possible for Cliff to maintain 
  this position in relation to Eastern Europe without also transferring the same 
  argument to Russia itself.</p>


<p>Cliff himself points to the fact that in the bourgeois revolution the masses 
  did the fighting and the bourgeois got the fruits. The masses did not know what 
  they were fighting for, but they fought in reality for the rule of the bourgeoisie. 
  Take the French Revolution. It was prepared and had its ideology in the works 
  of the philosophers of the enlightenment, Voltaire, Rousseau, etc. However, 
  they really did believe in the idealisation of bourgeois society. They believed 
  the codicils of liberty, equality and fraternity which they preached. As is 
  well known, and as Cliff himself quotes Marx to prove, the French Revolution 
  went beyond its social base. It resulted in the revolutionary dictatorship of 
  the <em>sans culottes </em>which went beyond the bounds of bourgeois society. 
  As Marx explained, this had the salutory effect of completing in a few months 
  what would otherwise have taken the bourgeois decades to do. The leaders of 
  the revolutionary wing of the petty bourgeoisie which wielded this dictatorship 
  - Robespierre, Danton, etc, sincerely believed in the doctrines of the philosophers 
  and attempted to put them into practice. They could not do so because it was 
  impossible to go beyond the economic base of the given society. They inevitably 
  had to lose power and merely paved the way for bourgeois society. If Cliff&#8217;s 
  argument is correct, one could only conclude that the same thing happened with 
  the Russian as with the French Revolution. Marx was the prophet of the new state 
  capitalism. Lenin and Trotsky were the Robespierres and Carnots of the Russian 
  Revolution. The fact that Lenin and Trotsky had good intentions is beside the 
  point, as were the good intentions of the leaders of the bourgeois revolution. 
  They merely paved the way for the rule of the new state capitalist class.</p>


<p>Thus, if the bureacracy used the masses of Czechoslovakia, and this constitutes 
  the proof that it is state capitalism, no less did the Russian bureaucracy use 
  the proletariat in the 1917 revolution. However, this theory can satisfy no 
  one. The fact that the bureaucracy, because Russia is a workers&#8217; state, with 
  all its degeneration, has assimilated Eastern Europe into the economy, and instantaneously 
  strangled the developing socialist revolution, means that simultaneously with 
  the socialist revolution, they have consciously carried through a process which 
  extended over many years in Russia. They have telescoped developments in the 
  image of Russia. This much should be clear: that without the existence of a 
  strong degenerated workers&#8217; state, contiguous or near to these countries, these 
  developments would have been impossible. Either the proletariat would have conquered 
  with a healthy revolution on classical lines and spread the revolution, or imperialism 
  would have crushed it.</p>


<p>Does this mean that the Stalinists have accomplished the revolution and therefore 
  there is no need for the Fourth International? Many times in history we are 
  confronted with a complicated situation. For instance, in the February revolution 
  in Russia which overthrew Czarism, the masses then proceeded to come under the 
  influence of the Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries. This meant that the 
  masses, having completed one task, the overthrow of Czarism - a political revolution 
  - created new barriers in their path and had to pay for this by a second revolution 
  - a social revolution in the form of October. The fact that the masses have 
  accomplished the basic social revolution in Eastern Europe only to have this 
  revolution immediately bureaucratised by the Thermidorian bureaucracy, means 
  that they will now have to pay with a second revolution - a <em>political </em>revolution.</p>


<p>Cliff has only to pose the question: what are the tasks of the Fourth International 
  in Russia? They are identical with those in Eastern Europe. In order to achieve 
  socialism the masses must have control of administration and the state. This 
  the Stalinists can never give. It can only be achieved by a new revolution. 
  It can only be accomplished with the overthrow of the bureaucracy in Eastern 
  Europe as in Russia. The tasks of the Fourth International are clear: <em>to 
  struggle for a political revolution to establish workers&#8217; democracy </em>- a 
  semi-state and the speedy transition to socialism on the basis of equality. 
  <em>The form of property will not be changed. </em>The fact that Cliff calls it 
  a social revolution alters nothing.</p>


<p>Where Trotsky found proof of a workers&#8217; state in the extension of the forms 
  of property, Cliff finds proof of the reverse.</p>


<p>Cliff may argue, that unless the working class has direct control of the state, 
  it cannot be a workers&#8217; state. In that case, he will have to reject the idea 
  that there was a workers&#8217; state in Russia, except possibly in the first few 
  months. Even here it is necessary to reiterate that the dictatorship of the 
  proletariat is realised through the instrumentality of the vanguard of the class, 
  ie the party, and in the party through the party leadership. Under the best 
  conditions this will be effected with the utmost democracy within the state 
  and within the party. But the very existence of the dictatorship, its necessity 
  to achieve the change in the social system, is already proof of profound social 
  contradictions which can, under unfavourable historical circumstances, find 
  a reflection within the state and within the party. The party, no more than 
  the state, can automatically and directly reflect the interests of the class. 
  Not for nothing did Lenin think of the trade unions as a factor necessary for 
  the defence of the workers <em>against their state, </em>as well as a bulwark 
  for the defence of their state.</p>


<p>If it was possible for the party of the working class (the social democracy), 
  especially through its leadership, to degenerate and fail directly to reflect 
  the interests of the class before the overthrow of capitalism, why is it impossible 
  for the state set up by the workers to follow a similar pattern? <em>Why 
  cannot the state gain independence from the class</em>, and parasitically 
  batten on it while at the same time (in its own interests) defend the new economic 
  forms created by the revolution? As we have previously shown, Cliff tries to 
  make a distinction by drawing a metaphysical line at 1928 between when he thinks 
  surplus value was not consumed by the bureaucracy and when it was. Apart from 
  being, factually inaccurate, it is a singularly lifeless way of examining the 
  phenomena.</p>


<p>In reality, the transition from one society to another was found to have been 
  far more complex than could have been foreseen by the founders of scientific 
  socialism. No more than any other class or social formation has the proletariat 
  been given the privilege of inevitably having a smooth passage in the transition 
  to its domination, and thence to its painless and tranquil disappearance in 
  society, ie, to socialism. That was a possible variant. But the degeneration 
  of both social democracy and the soviet state under the given conditions was 
  not at all accidental. It represented in a sense the complex relations between 
  a class and its representatives and state, which, more than once in history 
  the ruling class, bourgeois, feudal and slave-owning, had cause to rue. It mirrors 
  in other words, the multiplicity of historical factors which are the background 
  to the decisive factor: the economic.</p>


<p>Contrast the broad view of Lenin with the mechanistic view of Cliff. Lenin 
  emphasised over and over the need to study the transition periods of past epochs 
  especially from feudalism to capitalism, in order to understand the laws of 
  transition in Russia. He would have rejected the conception that the state which 
  issued from October would have to follow a preconceived norm, or thereby cease 
  to be a workers&#8217; state.</p>


<p>Lenin well knew that the proletariat and its party and leadership had no god-given 
  power which would lead, without contradictions, smoothly to socialism once capitalism 
  had been overthrown. That is necessarily the only conclusion which must follow 
  from the Kantian norms categorically laid down by Cliff. That is why in advance 
  Lenin emphasised that the dictatorship of the proletariat would vary tremendously 
  in different countries and under different conditions.</p>


<p>However, Lenin hammered home the point that in the transition from feudalism 
  to capitalism the dictatorship of the rising bourgeoisie was reflected in the 
  dictatorship of one man. A class could rule through the personal rule of one 
  man. <em>Ex post facto </em>Cliff is quite willing to accept this conception 
  as it applies to the bourgeoisie. But one could only conclude from his arguments 
  that such would be impossible in the case of the proletariat. For the rule of 
  one man implies absolutism, arbitrary dictatorship vested in a single individual 
  without political rights for the ruling class whose interests, in the last analysis, 
  he represents. But Lenin only commented thus to show that <em>under certain 
  conditions the dictatorship of the proletariat could also be realised through 
  the dictatorship of one man</em>. Lenin did not develop this conception. But 
  today in the light of the experience of Russia and Eastern Europe and with developments 
  in China, we can deepen and understand not only the present but the past developments 
  of society as well.</p>


<p>While the dictatorship of the proletariat can be realised through the dictatorship 
  of one man, because this implies the separation of the state from the class 
  it represents, it also means that the apparatus will almost inevitably tend 
  to become independent of its base and thus acquire a vested interest of its 
  own, even hostile and alien to the class it represents as in the case of Stalinist 
  Russia. When we study the development of bourgeois society, we see that the 
  autocracy of one individual, with the given social contradictions, served the 
  needs of the development of that society. This is clearly shown by the rule 
  of Cromwell and Napoleon. But although both stood on a bourgeois base, at a 
  certain stage bourgeois autocracy becomes, from a favourable factor for the 
  development of capitalist society, a hindrance to the full and free development 
  of bourgeois production. However, the dictatorship of absolutism does not then 
  painlessly wither away. In France and England it required <em>supplementary political 
  revolutions </em>before bourgeois autocracy could be changed into bourgeois democracy. 
  But without bourgeois democracy a free and full development of the productive 
  forces to the limits under capitalism would have been impossible.</p>


<p>If this applies to the historical evolution of the bourgeoisie, how much more 
  so to the proletariat in a backward and isolated country where the dictatorship 
  of the proletariat has degenerated into the dictatorship of one man?</p>


<p>For the proletariat to take the path of socialism, a new revolution, a supplementary 
  <em>political revolution </em>which will turn the Bonapartist proletarian state 
  into a workers&#8217; democracy is necessary. Such a conception fits in with the experience 
  of the past. just as capitalism passed through many stormy contradictory phases 
  (we are far from finished with them yet, as our epoch bears witness) so in the 
  given historic conditions has the rule of the proletariat in Russia. So also 
  by a mutual reaction, Eastern Europe and China are passing through this Bonapartist 
  phase, resulting in the inevitability of new political revolutions in these 
  countries in order to install workers&#8217; democracy as the prerequisite for a transition 
  to socialism.</p>


<p>It is in the inter-relation between the class and its state under given historical 
  conditions that we find the explanation of Stalinist degerieration, not in the 
  mystical idea that a workers&#8217; state, under all conditions, must be a perfect 
  workers&#8217; democracy or the transformation of the state into a class. In the long 
  run, the economic factor, as in bourgeois society, with many upheavals and catastrophes, 
  will emerge triumphant. The working class, having been enriched by the historical 
  experience and profiting from its lessons, will victoriously overthrow Stalinist 
  absolutism and organise a healthy workers&#8217; democracy on a higher level. Then 
  the state will, more or less, correspond to the ideal norm worked out by Marx 
  and Lenin.</p>
