The new
&#8220;Occupation Statute&#8221; which is to be applied to Germany
gives control of the Ruhr, the powerhouse of Europe,
to the British, French and American imperialists. In its provisions, it is far
more drastic than the Treaty of Versailles.
</p>
<p>
It reserves
to the Allies the right to control the Ruhr
industries, the manner in which the products are to be distributed, the level
of production and exports. The Military Security Board on which British, French
and American representatives will sit, will exercise control and inspection of
Western German industry in order to prevent rearmament of any sort. The
international control of the Ruhr extends to
cover management and production as well as distribution of coal, coke and
steel. Steel production is to be limited to 10,800,000 tons as compared to
pre-war production of 22,500,000 tons. It is intended that the Military
Security Board and control of the Ruhr will
remain after the occupation is terminated.
</p>
<p>
The Ruhr
Statute is a compromise between Anglo-American imperialism and France. The
French wish for a rigid national oppression of Germany as a guarantee against her
revival. The Anglo-American bloc is divided between the need to limit Germany as a competitor and the desire to use
the Ruhr as a base for the future struggle against Russia.
</p>
<h4>Bitterness in
Germany</h4>
<p class="fst">
The masses in
the Western Zone have reacted vigorously. The German political parties have
pointed out that only this one area is to be singled out for international
control. Carlo Smidt, Social Democrat, protested that &#8220;there could be no German
democracy if the country&#8217;s economic life was not one of self determination. The
German worker, he said, had three times been robbed of Socialism since 1918.&#8221; (<em>Times</em>,
January 9<sup>th</sup>).
</p>
<p>
The
disillusionment in the policy of the Allies has resulted in a wave of
nationalist sentiment. In the Ruhr, bitterness
has reached its height over the dismantling of the Bochumer Verein steel works.
The military Government succeeded in prevailing on a few to undertake the work
of dismantling this great factory. But the mass opposition of 11,000
engineering workers at the plant resulted in even some of the few labourers who
could be prevailed upon to undertake this work, refusing to do so. These
workers have now been sentenced to short terms of imprisonment.
</p>
<h4>Stalinists
try to recover lost ground</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
Stalinists are endeavouring to make capital out of the situation. As a result
of their policy in Berlin, the treatment of German prisoners of war, the brutal
expulsion of the Germans from Poland, the annexation of East Prussia and part
of German Silesia by Poland and Russia, the behaviour of the Red Army in
Germany, and the policy of reparations in Eastern Germany&#8212;all these led to a
loss for the Stalinists in the West of Germany. In the municipal elections last
year they lost nearly half their comparatively small vote. In the recent
election they lost every seat they held on the Executive of the Miners&#8217; Union.
</p>
<p>
To recover
some of the ground lost, the Stalinists have denounced the Ruhr Statute as an
imperialistic attempt to annexe the Ruhr, and have commenced an agitation
demanding the immediate conclusion of a Peace Treaty and the withdrawal of all
troops from Germany.
They have denounced all who accept the Statute as quislings.
</p>
<p>
Max Reimann
was arrested for a speech inciting action against the occupation powers. He has
been sentenced to three months imprisonment.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;He branded the occupation Statute as a new
colonial law imposed on Germany.
We shall fight until our beloved German people have been liberated from foreign
imperialists and those in Germany
who work with them.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;When he declared that
the Americans have annexed the Ruhr through
the Ruhr Statutes, there were excited shouts from the audience in the hall,
punctuated by such remarks as &#8216;They have no business to be here,&#8217; and &#8216;String
them up!&#8217; &#8221; (<em>Times</em>, January 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1949).
</p>
<p class="fst">
This does
not, of course, deter the French Communist Party from whipping up French
nationalist feelings and demanding the most stringent measures for control of
the Ruhr.
</p>
<p>
In an
endeavour to escape some of the odium surrounding the Russians in Germany, the
German C.P. in the Western Zone has been formally separated from the Socialist
Unity Party.
</p>
<p>
Such is the
mood in Eastern Germany, that 10,000 illegal
immigrants are moving from the Russian into the British Zone each month.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;According to their own statements, the refugees
have left the Russian Zone for political reasons or for personal safety. In the
younger age groups hundreds are taking this course rather than find themselves
conscripted for labour and directed to work in the uranium mines in Saxony. This influx of refugees to the British Zone is
going on continuously and according to official sources no end to it can be
foreseen for the present.&#8221; (<em>Times</em>, January 5<sup>th</sup>, 1949).
</p>
<p class="fst">
Concentration
camps have been established in the Eastern Zone for malcontents and a purge has
been instituted in the Socialist Unity Party against so-called &#8220;agents of the
Social Democratic Party, spies and saboteurs in foreign pay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Severe
measures&#8221; to &#8220;overcome the passive attitude of a section of the members&#8221; were
announced towards the end of last year by the Socialist Unity Party.
</p>
<p>
Having
established a totalitarian regime which violates the elementary precepts of
workers&#8217; democracy, the Socialist Unity Party has issued a statement over the
names of Pieck and Grotewohl, accusing the British Military Government of
having &#8220;trampled every democratic principle underfoot.&#8221; The <em>Times</em>
ironically reports:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;The emphasis on German national sovereignty and
territorial integrity has caused some questioning, even in Communist ranks,
about the Oder-Neisse line. One Party spokesman argues in reply that Germany is actually better off for the loss of
its Eastern Provinces and that the most productive countries are the most
densely populated, Holland and Belgium being
named in particular. Today&#8217;s <em>Berliner Zeitung</em> asked Germans to accept
the Oder-Neisse line as &#8216;a frontier of peace&#8217;. &#8216;The imperialist powers,&#8217; on the
other hand, &#8216;are tearing Germany
limb from limb&#8217; and are interested not in frontiers, but in fronts&#8212;in fact, in
raising a front in Western Germany against
&#8216;the democratic peace&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
In the
struggle between west and east, it is not excluded that a temporary compromise
may be reached between America
and Russia, in which the
Russians may even get the concession of a seat on the Board to control the Ruhr. In this case, the present opposition of the C.P.
would change instantly as the policies of the Stalinists have zigzagged in the
past.
</p>
<h4>British fear
competition</h4>
<p class="fst">
The British
are seriously concerned about the danger of cheap German goods once again
flooding the world market.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Harold
Wilson, President of the Board of Trade, arranged a meeting with shipbuilding
and engineering employers and union leaders for February 2<sup>nd</sup> to
consider the question of competition from Germany
and Japan.
&#8220;If German firms dumped goods in this country action could at once be taken
with the controlling authorities,&#8221; said Wilson.
The Germans are beginning to prepare for a drive for the markets of the world
which is bound to clash with the intensified British export drive.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Daily
Mail</em> editorial on January 24<sup>th</sup> says:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Some German goods are
selling at 40 percent less than comparable British goods in foreign markets.
The average wage in Germany
is &#163;3 3s. a week, as against the average of &#163;6 14s. in Britain. This
gives the advantage of cheap labour to the German industrialists. In
preparation for this drive, lavish catalogues have been sent to the West free
of charge by German industrialists. The articles mentioned in the catalogues
include jewellery, cosmetics, electric clocks, wrist watches and precision
instruments, cameras, lamp shades, leather goods, furniture and objects of
art.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Dr. Ollrath
von Maltzahn, Chief of the Anglo-U.S. Zone Foreign Trade Department at
Frankfurt, has pointed out that West
Germany&#8217;s exports in 1948 were nearly treble
the 1947 figures. &#8220;Britain
will have to recognise us as a competitor for world trade,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<h4>Failure of
Labour Government&#8217;s Policy</h4>
<p class="fst">
In a sane
Socialist society, far from limiting production, it would be increased to the
utmost capacity. But the great powers fear above all, commercial competition
based upon Germany&#8217;s superb industry, and the revival of her military might,
Germany&#8217;s industrial potential offers the perspective of the greatest danger to
rival capitalist countries; it offers also the greatest possibilities for the
working class of Europe if harnessed to a democratic Socialist plan, integrated
in a Socialist United States of Europe. Here is where the Labour Government is
failing in its foreign policy. A reduction of the standards of the German masses
constitutes the gravest menace to the British working class. In their own
interests the British Labour movement must reject the scheme to chain Germany, of
dismantling the German factories and the paying of reparations. The demand for
the rights of self-determination for all peoples applies to Germany as to
all other countries in any Socialist policy.
