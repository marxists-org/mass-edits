   <h4>Western Europe after the War</h4>
   <h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>From 1944, the RCP was the official British
section of the Fourth international, the leadership of which, the
International Secretariat (IS), was based in the United States
during the war. Because of the nazi occupation, the British had
been the only European section which had functioned openly in
wartime, so that by the time the IS was re-established in Paris,
it was the most developed section in the continent politically
and one of the most developed organisationally.</p>


<p>The end of the war brought about an entirely
novel situation in Europe, presenting the Marxists with difficult
and unforeseen theoretical problems. The revolutionary wave in
Western Europe did indeed manifest itself in the election of left
governments and the strident demands of the workers for concrete
reforms and social change. But the full impact of the workers'
movement was blunted by the Communist and Socialist Party
leaderships, acting as a brake on developments. The precise
characterisation of the post-war regimes in Western Europe and
the perspectives for these countries were the subjects of intense
debate within the Trotskyist movement.</p>


<p>No less controversial were the developments in
Eastern Europe. By far the greatest amount of conflict had
occurred on the Eastern Front and Germany had only been defeated
after a titanic struggle with the Red Army. But the end of the
war left the Stalinist bureaucracy in effective occupation of
half a dozen countries and a large slice of Germany and
controversy soon developed over perspectives for Russia itself -
whether the bureaucracy had been strengthened or weakened by the
war - and the occupied states.</p>


<p>From the very beginning of its formation, the
Revolutionary Communist Party had fundamental differences with
the IS on their analysis on all these questions. The post-war
leaders of the International were completely incapable of
re-adjusting to the new situation and judging developments from a
Marxist point of view. They clung dogmatically to the analysis
that had been developed by Trotsky in the thirties, repeating
sometimes parrot-fashion phrases and formulations which by 1945
were out-dated. Alone among all the Trotskyist groups, the RCP
was able, under the theoretical guidance of Ted Grant especially,
to apply the method of Marxism to come to terms with events and
thus to broaden, deepen and extend the ideas worked out by
Trotsky.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>The first part of this chapter is a document
entitled <em>The Changed Relationship of Forces in Europe and the
Role of the Fourth International</em>. It was presented by
Ted Grant as a policy document at the March 1945 Central
Committee of the RCP, approved in August at the national
conference and printed in <em>Workers International News in </em>September.
The resolution presents a broad analysis, an estimation of the
political situation coming out of the war and a tentative
perspective for the future.</p>


<p>In relation to those parts of Europe occupied
by the Red Army, the document was conditional because at this
stage of developments it was not clear how events would unfold.
It points out that the Stalinists had 'retained capitalism', but
it also raises the possibility of the Russian bureaucracy
becoming an agency of social change, albeit on the basis of a
totalitarian state: 'the bureaucracy will be forced, against its
own wishes and at the risk of antagonising its present
imperialist allies, to nationalise industry in the permanently
occupied countries, acting from above and, if possible, without
the participation of the masses.' These developments are dealt
with more fully in the next chapter on Eastern Europe.</p>


<p>More significantly, the resolution <em>The
Changed Relationship of Forces, </em>for the first time
acknowledged that there was a relative stabilisation in the
political situation in Western Europe. Against the leadership of
the IS, who were not prepared to face up to reality, the
resolution argued that there had been, thanks to the role of the
workers' leaders, a 'counter-revolution in a
&quot;democratic&quot; form'. It was a counter-revolution in as
much as the capitalist class had been able to ride out the
revolutionary moods within the working class - 'given the
weakness of the revolutionary vanguard...there is no hopeless
position for the bourgeoisie' - but 'democratic' because of the
weakness of reaction and the pressure of the mass organisations.</p>


<p>It is important to note that at this point,
mid-1945, it was possible to anticipate a relative political
stabilisation, although that was not to suggest that it would be
permanent: 'It is possible on the basis of the support rendered
to world imperialism by Stalinism and classical reformism (and
this is one of the objective factors to be reckoned with) that
world imperialism can succeed, for a period, in
&quot;stabilising&quot; bourgeois-democratic regimes in certain
countries.'</p>


<p>But what was not apparent at this stage, and
could not be, was the fact that Europe, and the West in general,
was on the threshold of an historic economic upswing which was to
last 25 years. What the resolution explains, in effect, are the
favourable political conditions which predicated the post-war
boom.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>The leadership of the International were still
repeating old and out-dated ideas. Among such leaders was Pierre
Frank, one of the leaders of the Parti Communiste
Internationaliste (PCI), the French section of the International.
He wrote an article, published in the June/July 1946 <em>Workers
International News, </em>which argued that in Western Europe,
there had been established only Bonapartist governments, ie
'Governments by the Sword', denying, in other words, that
'normal' capitalist democracy existed. The expression coined by
the RCP resolution, that there had been a 'counter-revolution in
a democratic form', was without meaning according to Frank.</p>


<p>Ted Grant's reply, published in the August 1946
<em>Workers International News, </em>and reprinted here for the
first time, was a devastating critique of Frank's muddled and
un-Marxist approach. To this day, the reply serves as a classic
description of Bonapartism, and an explanation of the role of the
state in capitalist society. In it, the ideas first put forward
in <em>The Changed Relationship of Forces </em>are further
developed. While the International leadership refused to face up
to reality, the RCP inisted on what was increasingly a
self-evident truth. that 'everywhere in Western Europe since the
&quot;liberation&quot; the tendency has been for a steady
movement towards bourgeois democracy', adding that '...at a later
stage, this tendency will be reversed.'</p>


<p>This document was one of many major works that
drew a line between the method and outlook of genuine Marxism and
the increasingly petit-bourgeois and sectarian outlook of the IS.
Although it is not the subject of this work, it is worth pointing
out that the manoeuvres of the IS - because of its inability to
answer the political criticisms of the RCP leadership -
eventually led to splits and then the disintegration of the
British section between 1947 and 1949. At that point Ted Grant
and the British Marxists turned their backs on this international
organisation. The fundamental differences in political outlook
were never resolved and eventually the so-called Fourth
International degenerated to the point where it was no more than
an umbrella grouping of tiny ultra-left sects.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>One organisation that took the post-war IS
position to its logical, and absurd, conclusion was the IKD, an
organisation of German and Austrian Trotskyists who had spent
most of the war years in exile in Britain. It published a
statement in 1943 (WIN April 1943), entitled <em>The National
Question -Three Theses, </em>in which it argued that the
occupation of Europe by nazi Germany had led to an economic
regression', that is, to the destruction of technology and
advanced methods of production, in favour of small and even
handicraft techniques. At the same time, the democratic rights of
the masses had been completely destroyed. The conclusion they
drew was that the basic tasks in the post-war period would be the
struggle for democracy, not unlike the capitalist revolutions of
the nineteenth century. The fundamental aim of the post-war
regimes, they argued, was 'basically equivalent to a democratic
revolution'.</p>


<p>Further material published by IKD members (WIN
July-August 1945) reiterated the same ideas adding, for example,
that in 'liberated' France, 'the national oppression has
remained, only the uniforms of the oppressors have changed.' This
was answered by Ted Grant in WIN October 1945 (reprinted in <em>Militant
International Review </em>number 26, Summer 1984). Another
contribution by IKD members, published in WIN September-October
1946, was entitled <em>Two Balance Sheets. </em>This
repeated, with minor modifications conceded under the pressure of
RCP criticisms, the basic ideas already outlined in the <em>Three
Theses.</em></p>


<p>Extracts from a second reply by Ted Grant are
included here as the third item in this chapter. This was first
published in <em>Workers International News </em>in
January-February 1947 and once again it explains the fundamental
character of the revolutionary movement in Western Europe,
notably in Greece and Germany, while at the same time pointing to
the treacherous role played by the leaders of the mass workers'
organisations.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>The fundamental hostility that developed
between the imperialist powers, dominated by the United States,
and the 'soviet' bloc, dominated by Russia, were reflected in the
post-war arms race and the so-called cold war. Nowhere was the
hostility more clear than in the continued division of Germany.
The areas occupied by British, French and American imperialism,
on the one side, and the area occupied by the Red Army on the
other, were becoming the de-facto, permanently separated states
of West and East Germany.</p>


<p>In the British labour movement a controversy
began over the question of West Germany's status within the
defence agreements of the capitalist powers and especially over
whether or not she should be allowed to re-arm. The NEC of the
Labour Party, dominated by the right wing, published a statement
in July 1954, entitled <em>In Defence of Europe, </em>in
which it argued in favour of a German contribution within the
structure of the European Defence Community. This proposal, for
strengthening the armed forces of the capitalist states against
the soviet 'threat', was dressed up in the language of
'reconciliation', 'partnership' and so on.</p>


<p>A month later, <em>Tribune</em>, then a paper of
the left of the Labour Party, published a pamphlet replying to
the NEC. It was written jointly by Aneurin Bevan, Barbara Castle,
Tom Driberg, Harold Wilson, Ian Mikardo and Richard Crossman, and
was called <em>It Need Not Happen. </em>It challenged the doctrine
that German rearmament was inevitable and argued that within the
context of NATO-Warsaw Pact rivalry, a re-armed West Germany,
backed by the United States, would be facing a hostile and armed
East Germany, backed by Russia. 'Once that is allowed to happen,'
the Bevanites claimed, 'World War Three becomes inevitable.'</p>


<p>In a pamphlet published as <em>Socialism and
German Unity, </em>Ted Grant polemicised against both the position
of Labour's right wing and that of the Tribunite left. In
particular, it attacked the idea, inherent in both left and right
pamphlets, that the German working class were responsible for the
war and that there was something inherently different about
German (as opposed to French, British or American) capitalism
that predisposed it to war. The pamphlet was reprinted in 1980,
under the title <em>Socialism and German Rearmament, </em>(although
wrongly dated as 1953) and extracts are reproduced here.</p>


<p>The last section in this chapter deals with the
coming to power of General Charles de Gaulle in France in May
1958, on the back of a political crisis triggered by the
beginning of the Algerian national war of independence. De
Gaulle, irreverently nicknamed 'Big Asparagus', had been the
leader of the 'Free French' government based in London during the
war and had led the immediate post-war government. He was
followed into office by a succession of unstable governments, the
longest of only 16 months duration, reflecting the social crisis
in France at the time.</p>


<p>Already by 1958, sections of the capitalist
class were preparing to cut across the chronic instability of the
French parliamentary government by a shift towards Bonapartism,
with de Gaulle cast in the leading role. The general would then
be given new constitutional powers to form a 'strong government'
to deal with the trade unions.</p>


<p>The pretext for this constitutional coup arose
over the war in Algeria. On May 13, the reactionary officers in
Algeria carried out a coup, involving the occupation of the
Ministry of Algeria and other public buildings by paratroops. The
officers announced the formation of a 'Committee of Public
Safety' under the chairmanship of General Massu, commander of the
crack paratroops division. General Salan (Commander-in-Chief,
Algeria) announced on radio that the Army had 'provisionally
taken over responsibility for the destiny of French Algeria'.</p>


<p>From his chateau near Paris, General de Gaulle
issued a statement which, while avoiding any reference to
Algeria, made it clear that he was ready 'to assume the powers of
the Republic'. To keep up the pressure on the incumbent
government of prime minister Pflimlin (referred to at one point
in the text by his nick-name, 'Little Plum'), eight days later
paratroops effected a coup in Corsica, isolating the island from
the government in Paris and linking it to Algiers.</p>


<p>To the labour movement around the world, all
these events recalled the rebellion of General Franco -beginning
in Spanish Morocco - against the Spanish Popular Front government
in July 1936. The difference was that the leaders of the French
Communist and Socialist Parties played an even more despicable
role than their counterparts had in Spain 22 years before.</p>


<p>Bearing in mind the end result of the Franco
rebellion, it seemed possible in May 1958 that there was a mortal
threat against the very existence of the workers' organisations
in France. Yet in this situation, the Communist Party refused to
mobilise the enormous support it had within the workers' movement
against the conspiracy of the officers, and the leadership of the
Socialists even supported the handing over of power to de Gaulle
as a 'lesser evil' compared to the generals.</p>


<p>The background to all these events was the
subject of a pamphlet, originally published as <em>France in
Crisis</em>, written by Ted Grant and completed only two days
before de Gaulle was brought into office. The pamphlet, extracts
of which are published here, was reprinted in 1980 as <em>The Rise
of De Gaulle and the Class Struggle. </em>It represents a further
development from the writings on post-war Europe of 1944-8, again
elaborating on the theme of Bonapartism.</p>


<p>As the pamphlet anticipated, de Gaulle's
accession to power, forming the twenty-sixth cabinet in 14 years,
heralded the development of constitutional changes in the
direction of Bonapartism. But what it also anticipated were the
limits of Bonapartism. Unlike a fascist movement, which is based
upon a mass movement of the frenzied petit bourgeois, a
Bonapartist movement lacks a stable social base from the very
beginning, and therein lies its relative weakness.</p>


<p>Because the power of the trade unions - despite
their leadership - remained intact, de Gaulle was never able to
assume full and unbridled dictatorial powers. He was always
constrained by the pressure of the labour movement and so was not
able to do more than hold in check the aspirations of the
workers, until they burst into the open in the revolutionary
events of May-June 1968.</p>


<p>When he first assumed power he appeased and
promoted those who had been responsible for the officers'
rebellion of May 1958. But he was nevertheless obliged at a later
stage, because of the power of the labour movement, to clip the
officers' wings. In typical Bonapartist fashion, after having
leaned on the right to strike blows at the left, he now leaned on
the left to strike blows to the right. In this way, he was able
to extricate France from the unwinnable war in Algeria - against
the wishes of the French settlers, the <em>colons </em>- and
destroy a new generals' conspiracy in the form of the OAS, the
Secret Army Organisation.</p>


<p>The pamphlet, <em>The Rise of De Gaulle</em>, with
the earlier writings of 1944-7, is essential background material
for understanding all the subsequent developments in post-war
France. It must form part of any serious study of so-called
'Gaullism' or more general studies as to the development and role
of Bonapartist regimes.</p>
