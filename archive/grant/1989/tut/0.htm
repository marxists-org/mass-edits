   <h2>Ted Grant</h2>
   <h1>The Unbroken Thread</h1>
   <hr />

   <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The purpose of this book is twofold. It is,
firstly, to show that the modern ideas of Marxism have their
direct roots in the working out of ideas in the previous period.
Secondly, it is to show the central and unique role played by Ted
Grant in the development of these ideas since the death of
Trotsky in 1940.</p>


<p>Ted Grant was born in Germiston, near
Johannesburg in South Africa. At the age of eleven, he was
introduced to the writings of Bernard Shaw, HG Wells, Maxim
Gorky, Jack London and others by Ralph Lee, a member of the
Communist Party and a friend of the family. Within a short time,
the reading material graduated on to the works of Marx, Engels
and Lenin, so that by the time he was fifteen, Ted Grant was a
confirmed Marxist.</p>


<p>His association with Trotskyist ideas began
with the critique that Trotsky made of the Sixth Congress of the
Communist International, in 1928. By a bureaucratic oversight
(much regretted by the Stalinists later), Trotsky's criticisms
were circulated to delegates. Some American communists smuggled
copies out after the Congress and began to organise the
distribution of Trotsky's writings, using, among other means, the
paper they founded, <em>The Militant.</em></p>


<p>&quot;I think it was in 1928 or 1929&quot;, Ted
Grant recalls, &quot;when the American Militant was sent to
radical bookshops in a number of different parts of the world,
and a few were sent to Johannesburg. They published all Trotsky's
criticisms of Stalinism, including his analysis of the aborted
revolution in China in 1925-27. We used to wait eagerly for the
arrival of each new batch of papers. We read them avidly from
cover to cover, especially the writing of Trotsky himself. These
contributions made an enormous difference to our
understanding.&quot;</p>


<p>Within a few years, Ralph Lee was expelled from
the Communist Party and he, Grant and another supporter, Murray
Gow Purdy, formed the Workers' International League in South
Africa. They regarded themselves as a left opposition to the
Stalinist leadership within the Communist Party, as did all the
newly-formed Trotskyist groups throughout the world. The WIL
around this time organised a strike of black laundry workers in
Johannesburg.</p>


<p>In this period, however, the black proletariat
was far smaller, with less social weight, in comparison to the
situation that developed after the war. It was understandable,
therefore, that South African Trotskyists should have looked for
inspiration to the many-millioned working class movement in
Europe, with its mightier organisations and longer traditions.
Not long after Hitler came to power in Germany, in mid-1933, Ted
Grant left South Africa, as he put it, for 'broader horizons' in
Europe.</p>


<p>The small South African group had already
corresponded with the Trotskyist movement in Britain, regularly
receiving <em>Red Flag, </em>its newspaper. Travelling with another
supporter of Trotsky, Sid Frost, Grant went by boat, first to
France, then on to London. While they stayed in Paris for a week
or two, they met and discussed with Leon Sedov, Trotsky's son and
a key organiser of the international Trotskyist movement.</p>


<p>In Britain, Grant joined the Independent Labour
Party, but only briefly, and then the Labour League of Youth, the
youth section of the Labour Party. With other Young Socialists,
he was very prominent in the day-to-day struggles against the
Mosleyite blackshirts, including the famous battle of Cable
Street.</p>


<p>In 1938, Ralph Lee also came to Britain, and
with Grant and others formed a Trotskyist group, once again
calling it the Workers International League. Lee was a talented
speaker and writer, but within two years returned to South
Africa, largely for personal reasons. The continuity of Ted
Grant's own political work was saved around this time by 'good
fortune': called up in 1940 to serve in the Pioneer Corps, he
unfortunately suffered a fractured skull in an accident, and was
invalided out of the Forces, without ever having donned the
khaki.</p>


<p>The Workers' International League was a marked
success in wartime conditions, its theoretical leadership mainly
the work of Grant. By 1944, the WIL took over the remnant of the
Revolutionary Socialist League, another smaller group, to form
the Revolutionary Communist Party. The RCP continued the success,
especially in the recruitment of industrial militants. So much so
that the War Cabinet was supplied with a secret memo from the
Labour Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, outlining the policies
of the RCP, and giving brief biographies of its leaders,
including Ted Grant. Although it was not carried through in the
end, it is clear that the capitalist class was seriously
considering banning the RCP.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, the marvellous momentum of the
wartime work was not reflected in the fortunes of the RCP
afterwards. This is not the place to give a history of British
Trotskyism, but without going into all the background and the
causes, it is enough to know that the RCP broke up in 1949-50.
Suffice to say that this was in large measure due to bureaucratic
interference and outright manoeuvres by the leadership of the
Fourth International, of which the RCP was a part.</p>


<p>The International leaders had never been
capable of facing up to and explaining the new situation that
arose after the war. It was only Ted Grant who had come to terms
with developments and described them in Marxist terms. By the
time of the demise of the RCP, Ted Grant was the dominant
theoretical force within British Trotskyism, and, as the extracts
in this volume show, a hundred times more correct than the
alleged theoreticians of the International.</p>


<p>After the RCP disintegrated Grant continued to
put forward a Marxist view in a variety of journals and
magazines. He was editor of <em>The International Socialist, </em>a
theoretical magazine, and later editor of the paper, <em>Socialist
Fight</em>. 'When that was coming out duplicated,' he recalls, 'I
was doing most of the work for it myself. I wrote most of it. I
typed it once, proof-read it and typed it again to justify it
(adjust the type to fit evenly between the margins). I even had a
hand in working the duplicator from time to time.'</p>


<p>In 1964, he was one of the founders of the
newspaper <em>Militant</em>, still going strong, twenty-five years
later, as 'the Marxist voice for Labour and Youth'. As political
editor of the <em>Militant </em>he has written regularly on all
major political questions, as well as contributing to <em>Militant
International Review, </em>writing pamphlets and documents, and
giving countless speeches and lectures.</p>


<p>Because of the growth in support for the paper,
the leadership of the Labour Party began to expel its supporters,
beginning with the editorial board, in 1983. After having
rejoined the Labour Party in 1950, with thirty-three years
continuous membership, Ted Grant was expelled. But to expel the
'head' of a movement, is not to expel the movement itself. The
political work of half a century cannot be erased by a flash of
the block vote. The fruits of fifty years of work, of an
unrivalled contribution to socialist theory are there to be seen:
in the development of a Marxist tendency deeply rooted in and
inseparable from the labour movement. Political parties,
tendencies and individuals, cannot be judged simply by the formal
position they happen to adopt at any one point in time. Even the
most limp-brained 'theoretician' can stumble upon a correct idea
once in a while. It is better to judge a theory or a set of ideas
dialectically, in other words, to examine them in the process of
their origin, formation and development.</p>


<p>It was not for sentimental reasons that Lenin
and Trotsky urged young comrades to respect the traditions of the
socialist movement. It is because in the traditions lie the
distilled conclusions of all the theoretical debates and
discussions of decades, made sharp by the living experience of
the working class. Many young workers today, for example, will
take for granted, 'assume', the correctness of certain
theoretical concepts, analyses and political methods. Even much
of the terminology, the 'jargon' of Marxism, which is more exact
and meaningful (as befits a science) than that of the trendy and
superficial political sociologists of capitalism, is taken for
granted.</p>


<p>But this Marxian theoretical tradition, so
often taken as read today, did not appear from nowhere; it had to
be fought for. It had to be established and consolidated against
all the illusory ideas, the opportunism and ultra-leftism that
pervaded the working class movement, including the so-called
Trotskyist movement, after the war. And in creating that
theoretical tradition, in carrying on the development of Marxism
in an unbroken thread from the work of Leon Trotsky, there has
been no greater contribution made than that of Ted Grant.</p>


<p>For four decades since the end of the war -
nearly five since the death of Trotsky - Grant has defended the
method of Marxism against all kinds of alien ideas. What makes
this achievement all the more remarkable is that this has been a
period, for the most part, of economic upswing and political
reaction, at least in the advanced capitalist countries. In the
hey-day of the post-war boom, it really did seem to many that
capitalism had learnt to overcome the crises and class struggles
of the past. The forces of genuine Marxism were reduced,
literally, to a handful in one part of the globe. The Stalinist
parties became ever more degenerate. The former 'Fourth
International' became a circus of middle-class sects, prey to
opportunist and ultra-left influences.</p>


<p>It is to one person alone that the credit must
go for the maintenance and development of Marxist theory in this
most difficult period. Through having an international
perspective, and anticipating the limitations of the boom, it was
possible to retain complete confidence in the working class and
the future of socialism. This, combined with an unbreakable will,
ploughed the ground for the later period when the forces of
Marxism have been able to grow from tens to tens of thousands.
Support for these ideas has spread not only in Britain, but
internationally.</p>


<p>In Britain, <em>Militant</em> has established
Marxism, which in its modern form is Trotskyism, as a bona-fide
current of opinion in the labour movement. Stalinism has for
decades besmirched the genuine heritage of Marx and Lenin and has
thrown up clouds of confusion and doubt in the minds of active
workers. More recently, the traditions of Leon Trotsky have been
dragged in the mud by a bewildering variety of middle-class
ultra-left groups, most of whom have as much connection with
workers as with the man in the moon.</p>


<p>But clearly distinguishing themselves from the
Stalinists on the one hand and the middle-class
're-re-revolutionaries' on the other, the supporters of Militant
have worked to build an increasingly significant base of support
for their ideas in both the Labour Party and the trade unions.
This has been done by debate and discussion, patiently explaining
their views with a battery of facts, figures and arguments.
Personal attacks, sneers, physical threats, intimidation, stunts:
notwithstanding the lies of the capitalist media, these have no
place whatsoever in the methods of political work instilled by
Ted Grant into <em>Militant</em> supporters.</p>


<p>The leaderships of the various unions and the
Party - not being able to answer argument and debate - have
frequently resorted to organisational measures to rid themselves
of the Marxists. In the climate of witch-hunting that presently
prevails inside the Labour Party, supporters of <em>Militant </em>are
being expelled quite blatantly for their ideas. But these
expulsions and restrictions will be in vain. Already, the <em>Militant
</em>has come to represent a powerful Marxist current in a number
of the major trade unions and in the Labour Party and it will not
be possible for the ideas of the paper to be separated from the
labour movement. On the contrary, these will be the ideas of the
majority in the future.</p>


<p>The frustration of the witch-hunters arises out
of their inability to answer the ideas of Militant. The paper has
built for itself a reputation of solid attachment to political
theory, its supporters taking seriously all the international,
historical and theoretical questions that affect the workers'
movement. It would not be an exaggeration to say that where the
Marxists have an influence in the movement, there always follows
a tremendous thirst for theory. The detractors of Marxism
frequently sneer at what they perceive as unnecessary baggage,
but the value of correct theory has been demonstrated time and
time again.</p>


<p>While the Stalinists and the reformists
acknowledge events only when they are struck on the nose by them
(and even then sometimes not), the Marxists, as scientific
socialists, can gain an insight into social processes and the
laws that underlie them. It is possible by this means to develop
a perspective, a prognosis of the likely out-turn of events, on
the basis of a detailed examination of past and present
conditions in society, the direction of change, and so on.
Marxism can be said to be the science of perspectives, and in
political questions, it repeatedly proves the invaluable
advantage gained by foresight over astonishment.</p>


<p>Many examples can be given to show the
superiority of Marxist methods in relation to current political
questions. Just to take one issue, there is at present a great
deal of discussion about the 'reforms' of Mikhail Gorbachev in
the USSR and the alleged shift of Hungary and Poland towards
'democracy'. This is not the place to go into the question in
great detail, but readers of the <em>Militant </em>will know that
the paper has a well-founded and consistent view on the matter.
It has argued that the Stalinist bureaucracy in these states is
incapable of yielding any genuine democracy and will not be
prepared to share power with any movement or organisation that
represents the working class.</p>


<p>This view adopted by <em>Militant</em> has not
been whistled out of an editor's thumb, but rests upon a
long-standing theoretical tradition and an understanding of the
social forces and processes in Eastern Europe. It relies upon a
scientific appraisal of the origin of the bureaucracy, its role
and relationship to the state, and so on.</p>


<p>On the other hand, elsewhere within the labour
movement, there are illusions about how far the 'reforming'
process can go, some commentators suggesting, for example, that
the 'legalisation' of the Solidarity trade union in Poland marks
a profound change and a step towards Western-style democracy.
Which view is correct?</p>


<p>To answer this it is instructive to go back to
1980, to the period of the origin and growth of the Solidarity
union. When the Polish regime signed an agreement at that time,
also 'legalising' the union, there were similar illusions, not
least within the leadership of the union itself, that the
Stalinist state was prepared to tolerate and co-exist with it. <em>Militant</em>
argued otherwise:</p>


<p>&quot;There can be no half-way house. There
will either be totalitarian control under a one-party state, as
exists in Eastern Europe and Poland, or there will be control of
industry and the state by the workers as envisaged by Marx, Lenin
and Trotsky. An uneasy compromise between the two can exist for
only a very short time&#133;the bureaucracy, taking advantage of
the inevitable disillusionment amongst the workers, and the
ebbing of the movement, will inevitably move to strangle the
unions, or incorporate them into the state machine.&quot; (Ted
Grant, <em>Militant</em> 522, October 3 1980)</p>


<p>Unfortunately, because it gives no pleasure to
a Marxist to see a workers' movement suppressed by martial law,
the prognosis of the <em>Militant </em>was absolutely correct and
borne out by events. The illusion - so bluntly and
unceremoniously shattered - that Solidarity would be allowed to
organise as a free trade union in a totalitarian state was shown
to have been based, not on any firm theoretical premise, but on a
hope and a prayer.</p>


<p>It is of more than academic interest to show
the enormous advantage of scientific method over empirical
impressionism. Theory is not counter-posed to political activity,
but is dialectically linked to it. If it were only a question of
working class self-sacrifice, heroism and a willingness to
struggle, then socialism would have been established across the
whole globe many decades ago. It is also a matter of
organisation, direction, purpose and leadership. All too often,
the most courageous workers' movements have been shipwrecked by
'leaders' completely blind to social processes. The huge benefit
of foresight, of a grasp of perspectives and developments, lies
precisely in the creation of the subjective factor: in building a
leadership for the labour movement that matches in understanding
what the workers always provide in determination.</p>


<p>But what also has to be understood, and the
reason why this brief example is given, is that this Marxist
analysis of Eastern Europe, on which could be built a uniquely
correct understanding of events and a proven perspective, did not
fall overnight from the sky. It represents an extension of a
consistent Marxist critique that was established by Ted Grant in
the debates and discussions in the first four or five years after
the second world war. Moreover, this analysis was itself an
extension of the position already worked out by Leon Trotsky
before the war.</p>


<p>Taking the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and
Trotsky as a method, rather than as a fixed dogma, Ted Grant has
achieved more than any other Marxist theoretician in explaining
post-war developments. As the material in this volume shows, the
theoretical line that he laid down, especially in the first few
years after the war, provided the starting point for an
understanding of political and economic developments in the three
parts of the world: the advanced capitalist countries, the
colonial and ex-colonial countries and the Stalinist states.</p>


<p>No other tendency of the right or the left has
had the same honest, earnest and open approach to discussion. In
contrast to the Stalinists and the ultra-left sects, all of whom
have made an industry out of hiding their previous mistakes and
theoretical somersaults, there are none of the writings or
speeches of Ted Grant that the author would not now be prepared
to re-issue and debate.</p>


<p>That is not to say that there were never any
mistakes made, especially in perspectives, in estimating the
tempo of events. He who does not make mistakes does not make
anything. But the tradition of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky
was always one of openly admitting their errors, explaining them
and going forward strengthened, with programme or perspective
suitably amended. It is in keeping with this tradition that this
selection is offered for those wishing to study the development
of Marxism in the post-war world.</p>


<h4>*</h4>

<p>The selection of material for this single
volume has been a very difficult task. There are many, many
documents, articles and speeches that have, of necessity, to be
left out. In the recent period, there have been major works on
Spain and Portugal (mid 1970s), the National Question, the
Falklands War, Gorbachev, Iran, the Philippines, Nicaragua,
documents on world perspectives, like <em>The Coming World
Revolution </em>(1984), and many more.</p>


<p>Every one of these works forms part of a
consistent whole, linked each to the other, and based on the
theoretical roots traced out in this volume. The material on the
Falklands War, for example, deals with the fundamental question
of war from a Marxist standpoint. It is available in pamphlet
form and should be re-read after reading the section in Chapter
One on the wartime controversy between the WIL and RSL.</p>


<p>Even in the realm of domestic British politics,
there are many issues that are barely dealt with here, if at all.
The long-running discussion within the Trotskyist movement about
the role of the Labour Party, for example, is hardly done justice
here. That may not please some readers, but unfortunately, that
would be true whatever the final selection made. A full record of
all Ted Grant's political work will have to await a more thorough
search and collection than has been possible here. That, in any
case, would mean a publication running to many volumes.</p>


<p>In so far as there has been any bias introduced
in the selection of documents, it has been towards older
material. This is because the earlier articles, many of them not
having been reprinted since the original, are less likely to have
been seen by the modern reader. But it is also because the
theoretical contributions in the immediate post-war decade formed
the bedrock upon which an entire tradition was subsequently
built.</p>


<h4>*</h4>

<p>A word or two is necessary in relation to the
editing of the material for this volume. The main reason why
original articles and documents have been cut has been in an
attempt to concentrate as much as possible in a single volume,
without vulgarising or simplifying the theoretical constructions.
Here and there short points have been taken out where they
digress from the main theme, for example in a comment that would
have had an immediate relevance at the time of writing, but which
has since been lost.</p>


<p>It has been made clear where the material
included is incomplete, ie where it is based on extracts from a
larger work. But there is no indication in the text (for example
&#133;) where sections, paragraphs, and in some cases even
sentences have been left out. There is no ulterior motive for
this: the originals are a matter of record and when the collected
works are published at some stage in the future the omissions and
editing will be made good. The extracts have been closed up, and
allowed to run together, simply for the sake of continuity.</p>


<p>The arrangement of the selected material into
chapters has been broadly based on the theoretical issues dealt
with, apart from the first and final chapters. Although this
means inevitably that there are some articles and documents that,
strictly speaking, overlap more than one chapter, the editors
feel that this arrangement is a better guide to study than one
that would have been based, whatever the subject matter, purely
on chronological order.</p>


<p>The style of writing has been left as in the
original and quotations, for example of Marx, Engels, Lenin and
Trotsky, have been checked as far as possible with modern
editions. The chapter introductions are intended to provide the
reader with some context in which to place the various writings.
It would probably be useful to re-read the relevant part of the
chapter introduction before beginning to read each new part of a
chapter.</p>


<p>It is only to be expected that some of the
material included in the book will be difficult to read or
understand at the first attempt, especially for readers coming to
political theory for the first time. That is unavoidable.
Political theory often needs to be thought over, discussed and
re-read. It means, in the proper use of the term, having to
study, as one would study any other science. As Karl Marx
explained:</p>


<p>&quot;There is no royal road to science, and
only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep
paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits.&quot;</p>


<p>A careful and diligent study of the material in
this volume, combined with discussion and further reading of
sources and basic works, will play an indispensible role in the
political steering of future generations of socialists.</p>
