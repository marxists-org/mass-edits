   <h4>The Post War Boom: Origins, Effects and Decline</h4>
   <h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>The most important feature of the entire
post-war epoch, overshadowing and influencing all other factors,
was the long, 25-year economic upswing. This represented the
greatest explosion in investment, production, trade, science and
technique in the whole of human history and it put its stamp on
political developments in all the different parts of the world.
In the advanced capitalist countries, as prosperity reached and
then easily surpassed pre-war levels, it rekindled illusions in
capitalism as a viable and 'natural' economic system. These
illusions were transmitted to and articulated in the labour
movement by the theoreticians of the right, who were
indistinguishable from the spokespersons of capitalism.</p>


<p>But in the immediate post-war period, the
longevity of the postwar boom could not have been anticipated.
What was an issue within the Trotskyist movement was whether or
not there would be any economic recovery at all. The material of
the British Revolutionary Communist Party, and particularly the
writings of Ted Grant, argued that there was a temporary
political stabilisation in Western Europe, because of the
influence of the social democratic and Stalinist leaderships,
acting as a brake on the workers' movement. The political
recovery of capitalism provided the political basis for, and was
itself further underpinned by, economic recovery. (See the parts
in Chapter Two, dealing with 'counter-revolution in a democratic
form').</p>


<p>As on all the other main political issues dealt
with, the international leadership of the Fourth International
were incapable of facing up to new conditions. The European
Executive of the International, based in Paris, argued in January
1945 that 'the revolutionary action of the masses' had removed
the 'last possibilities for the bourgeoisie to restore the
economy which has been ruined and dilapidated by the war.' In a
further report in December, the same body argued that the
countries of Europe, would remain on a level approaching
stagnation and slump.'</p>


<p>Because Trotsky had argued before the war that
capitalism could not further develop the productive forces, the
leadership of the Fourth International, the International
Secretariat, were loath to say otherwise. Rather than using the
Marxist <em>method </em>that Trotsky had applied, they stuck
rigidly to the <em>letter </em>of his writings, despite the
increasing weight of evidence that an economic recovery was
underway in the capitalist countries.</p>


<p>The draft resolution put forward by the IS for
the International Pre-Conference of April 1946 stated: 'The most
probable perspectives of the evolution of the world economy may
be outlined as follows: The revival of economic activity in
capitalist countries weakened by the war, and in particular
continental European countries, will be characterised by an
especially slow tempo which will keep their economies at levels
bordering on stagnation and slump.'</p>


<p>Members of the IS, including supposed economic
'experts', doggedly argued that the 1938 production levels of the
European countries would not be exceeded. Ernest Mandel, for
example, wrote in 1947 that 'the situation in the British economy
is not that of a boom if one wishes to give this term the
significance that Marxists have always given to it&#133;it is
necessary to abandon right now any juggling with a boom that has
not existed and that British capitalism will never experience
again.'</p>


<p>The draft theses put forward in 1947 by the IS
for the forthcoming world congress, still refused to acknowledge
the new conditions that were staring them in the face. They
harped on the same theme as the year before: that there would be
'increased disequilibrium', and that capitalism was 'incapable of
restoring the world market and a balanced development of world
trade.'</p>


<p>It was the RCP, as on other questions, that
argued the theoretical line which was proved correct. Basing
themselves on the figures for production, investment and growth,
particularly but not exclusively for Britain, the RCP leaders
demonstrated the irrefutable fact that a rapid economic boom was
developing. The first item in this chapter is a statement on <em>Economic
Perspectives</em>, put forward as an amendment to the IS
resolution at the April 1946 International Pre-Conference. It was
published in <em>Workers' International News, </em>November-December
1946. In contrast to the IS position, it argues that:</p>


<p>&quot;&#133;the laws of capitalism...ensure the
upswing of economy and make a new 'boom' inevitable. Particularly
in view of the fact that this crisis is not a crisis of
over-production&#133;It is not excluded that particularly for
Western Europe (with the exception of Germany and Austria) the
production figures can even reach and surpass the pre-war level
in the next period&#133;All the factors on a European and world
scale indicate that the economic activity in the next period is
not one of 'stagnation and slump' but one of revival and
boom.&quot;</p>


<p>It is important to note that no-one in the
Trotskyist movement internationally, including the RCP, believed
that the post-war boom would last more than a few years, before
it gave way to an inevitable downturn. The amendment (which,
incidentally, was defeated at the conference) agreed with the IS
statement in emphasising 'the epoch of the decline and collapse
of world capitalist economy&#133;there is not the least ground
for the hope or fear that the economic revival, which in and of
itself is inevitable, will be able to overcome the general decay
in world economy and in European economy in particular.' In the
early stages of the post-war boom, therefore, it was Ted Grant
and the RCP leadership who were insisting, against the economic
'theoreticians' of the IS, that there was indeed a revival. But
ironically, once the revival took hold, and unexpectedly
developed into a fully-fledged upswing, the nature of the debate
turned to its opposite.</p>


<p>It was in this period of upswing that the right
wing of the labour movement - who always base themselves on the
capitalist system, as opposed to socialist ideas - were given a
new lease of confidence. The theoreticians of the right wing, in
the Fabian Society, for example, fell over themselves to announce
that class struggle was at an end and that the very concept of
'class' was losing its meaning. Slumps and mass unemployment were
the horrors of the past that would never be repeated, society had
learnt to overcome past conflicts and from now on, they argued,
there would be a gradual and unbroken increase in living
standards. The leadership of the Labour Party, around Hugh
Gaitskell, even tried (unsuccessfully, because of the resistance
of the rank and file and the trade unions) to remove the
socialist Clause 4 from the Labour Party constitution.</p>


<p>The second part of this chapter consists of an
article in the <em>International Socialist </em>(edited by Ted
Grant), November-December 1952, commenting on the <em>New Fabian
Essays. </em>In the <em>Essays, </em>writers like Richard Crossman,
Anthony Crosland and Roy Jenkins, put forward the idea that the
'welfare state' or 'welfareism' had superseded class society. 'By
1951', Crosland argued, 'Britain had in all essentials ceased to
be a capitalist country'.</p>


<p>Cutting through the superficiality of the
Fabian theories, Grant defends the basic Marxist position, that
as long as the market dominated the economy, then there would
inevitably be cycles of boom and slump. Explaining the causes for
the longevity of the boom, he also points out its limitation and
the inevitability, at a later stage, of new recessions and
slumps. This article, although directed particularly towards the
British economy, was no less relevant to the other main
capitalist countries, where similar conditions prevailed and
similar arguments raged.</p>


<p>Nearly forty years later, the arguments in the
article have lost none of their relevancy, because in all their
essentials, the so-called 'modern' policies put forward by the
right wing in the Labour Party in the late 1980s are the same as
the discredited notions of their 1950s predecessors.</p>


<p>The third article in the chapter is a
development on the same theme as above. Written as a discussion
document in 1960, at the height of the boom, and published by
Sussex University Socialist Society in 1967, <em>Will There Be a
Slump?</em> was a major contribution to the debate on economic
perspectives. The right wing and the Fabians, arguing from the
basis of the economic theories of John Maynard (later Lord)
Keynes, alleged that the capitalist state - by limited
nationalisations, economic intervention and state expenditure
such as on social welfare - could smooth out the natural economic
cycle and thus overcome crises.</p>


<p>They were also echoed on the left, by alleged
'Marxists' who effectively adopted similar Keynesian theories.
Influenced by what seemed to be an endless expansion, the same
economic gurus who had originally denied the possibility of
recovery now went to the opposite extreme. After having belatedly
acknowledged the upswing, they also came forward with wonderful
new theories describing how capitalism had been fundamentally
changed so as to be able to avoid crises and slumps. It was
argued, for example, (by Tony Cliff, and others) that arms
expenditure represented a means by which the capitalist state
could stimulate the economy so as to avoid slump: thus a
'permanent arms economy' was coming into being.</p>


<p>In the pamphlet <em>Will There Be a Slump?</em>,
all these arguments are debunked. State intervention, it is
explained, can increase the scope and scale of an upswing, but
only if the fundamental conditions for capitalist upswing are
present. In conditions of crisis, state expenditure (including
spending on arms), rather than a benefit, becomes a monstrous
incubus that tends to drag the economy even further down.</p>


<p>Once again, the fundamental perspective of an
inevitable slump was put forward: 'Whatever the exact date, it is
absolutely certain that the unprecedented post-war boom must be
followed by a catastrophic downswing, which cannot but have a
profound effect on the political thinking of the enormously
strengthened ranks of the labour movement.'</p>


<p>The validity of these arguments have been well
demonstrated by the onset of economic crisis in all the advanced
capitalist countries since the mid-1970s. At the same time, it is
now clear that the level of state expenditure of the boom period,
rather than acting as a means of avoiding slump, has become a
source of unbridled inflation, a destabilising factor that the
capitalists of all countries have tried to avoid by slashing
government spending on welfare, education, health and so on.</p>


<p>As postscripts to the above documents, the
fourth and fifth parts of the chapter are relatively brief
extracts from discussion documents, dealing with world
perspectives in the post-boom period. The Marxists had not been
able to predict the long duration of the post-war boom, but what
was clear was that the first recession to affect all the advanced
capitalist economies simultaneously, in 1974-5, marked the end of
one epoch and the beginning of another. Later than may have been
anticipated, events nevertheless vindicated the correct stand
that had been made by Ted Grant on the fundamentals of capitalist
economics.</p>


<p>As these two extracts argue, and as subsequent
events have demonstrated, the outlook for world capitalism has
changed fundamentally since the mid-1970s. The present epoch is
one of stagnation and slump, interspersed with periods of
recovery that are weak and anaemic compared to the boom period of
the 1950s and 1960s. In all capitalist countries there has been a
return to mass unemployment, economic instability and social
crisis.</p>


<p>Moreover, the crisis facing the advanced
capitalist countries is paralleled by crisis in the
under-developed countries and in the Stalinist states, especially
Eastern Europe. For the first time, because of the
interpenetration of economic and political crises in all the main
parts of the globe, there is the perspective, in the full meaning
of the term, of world revolution.</p>
