   <h4>The War Years</h4>
   <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>By 1938, while the rest of Europe was hurtling
towards another carnage even more bloody than the last, in Spain
the civil war was drawing inexorably towards defeat for the
Republic.</p>


<p>The Spanish working class had taken the
election of the Popular Front government in 1936 as the beginning
of the socialist revolution and had moved spontaneously to occupy
mines, offices, factories and the land. It was only the movement
of the working class, arming itself and mobilising independently
of the Popular Front government, that prevented a complete and
immediate victory for the rebellion of General Franco in July
1936.</p>


<p>But what began as a civil war between a fascist
regime and an incipient socialist revolution was transformed
within two years into a conflict between fascism and the
capitalist republic. With the enthusiastic backing of the
Stalinists the revolutionary movement triggered by the Popular
Front was crushed and the capitalist state firmly established. So
much so that towards the end of the war there was little to
choose between the two governments on either side of the line as
far as the workers were concerned.</p>


<p>In Britain, the newly-formed Workers
International League (WIL) published a pamphlet by Trotsky,
entitled <em>The Lessons of Spain</em>. In this 'the Old Man'
analysed in particular the failure of the Workers' Party of
Marxist Unification (POUM) to play the role of a Spanish
Bolshevik Party, providing the clear, decisive and determined
leadership that had been available to the Russian workers in
1917.</p>


<p>The intention of the WIL in publishing
Trotsky's pamphlet was to draw attention to the need for a
Marxist leadership in Britain, in view of the inevitability of a
new world war and the revolutionary shocks that would come in its
wake. The introduction to the WIL pamphlet, reprinted here, was
actually seen and commanded by Trotsky himself. Although it was
originally signed 'JRS', it was in fact written jointly by Ted
Grant and Ralph Lee, both leading WIL members.</p>


<p>When the imperialist war began in Europe, there
was at first a period of disorientation in the whole Trotskyist
movement. But on the basis of the advice of Trotsky, especially
in the most recent writings before his assassination in August
1940, it was possible for the WIL to re-orientate itself to the
new situation it faced. Trotsky advocated the adoption of a
'proletarian military policy' based upon the militarisation of
everyday life of the working class.</p>


<p>It was not correct, Trotsky argued, to advance
the slogan of revolutionary defeatism - of the defeat of 'one's
own' imperialism - in a bald and simplistic manner. Lenin, in any
case, brought forward the slogan in a different context - where
he sought to re-educate the <em>cadres </em>of the Marxist movement
in the spirit of internationalism, not address the masses
directly. It would be wrong, Trotsky insisted, to give the
impression to workers that the Marxists favoured support for the
'enemy' imperialism, especially given the loathing that workers
in Britain and America felt for the nazi regime which had
bloodily crushed the organisations of the German labour movement.</p>


<p>Without, therefore, giving any concession to
principles, or giving any support to British capitalism in its
alleged war aims, the WIL was able to utilise the genuine fears
of the workers of a nazi invasion - especially after the fall of
France in 1940 - to raise class demands and to win supporters to
the banner of Trotskyism. But in so doing, the WIL drew criticism
from the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL), a largely middle
class coalition of Trotskyists without the same decisive working
class orientation of the WIL. Both organisations supported the
Fourth International, founded by Trotsky in 1938, but the RSL was
the official British section, up to 1944.</p>


<p>A whole series of polemical articles and
correspondence flowed between the WIL and the RSL over the
question of the war: the RSL accusing the WIL of holding a
'defencist' position, the WIL replying by pointing to the
petit-bourgeois pacifism of the RSL. When the WIL published their
document entitled <em>Preparing for Power </em>(see below) the RSL
wrote a lengthy criticism of it. The reply of the WIL to this
criticism, written by Ted Grant, was a brilliant exposition of
the whole question of the military policy, a comprehensive
statement that effectively terminated the debate.</p>


<p>Extracts of this WIL document are published
here, and although they are dated by the meeting of the Political
Bureau of the WIL of June 1943, they are included here as the
second item because in a political sense the issues cover the
whole period of more than two years up to that point.</p>


<p>The third item in this section is composed of
extracts from <em>Preparing for Power</em> written by Ted Grant in
June 1942 as the main perspectives document of the WIL, and
published in <em>Workers International News </em>in September. It
especially underlines the historic decline of British capitalism
and the inevitability of further decay, even in the event of a
victory over nazi Germany: 'Defeat...means the end of British
imperialism as a power of the first rank. Victory will mean a
less spectacular decline to a second rate position under the
patronage of America. This is the best that the British ruling
class can hope for.'</p>


<p>Three years before the end of the war, the
document anticipates the revolutionary wave that would grip the
working class, affecting the shop stewards' committees, the trade
union branches and the Labour Party: 'On the basis of the rising
wave of discontent with potential revolutionary implications, it
is inevitable that the decisive section of the trade union and
Labour bureaucrats, including the majority of the parliamentary
representatives, will be forced into an open clash with the
capitalist class and a breaking of the coalition. In words at
least, they will assume an extremely radical attitude.'</p>


<p>It was on the basis of these perspectives that
the WIL conducted its war-time work and established a basis in
industry far greater than that of other Trotskyist groups, which
remained small sects.</p>


<p>For the WIL there was no class 'truce' in the
factories and workplaces during the war. But after the invasion
of the USSR in 1941, the Communist Party of Great Britain did a
complete somersault, from being opposed to the war, to being one
hundred and twenty per cent in favour. The Party became the most
fervent supporter of the Churchill government, vociferously
denouncing any strikes or workers' struggles that cut across
production.</p>


<p>Unaccustomed to the CP being, in effect, a
strike-breaking organisation, many of its best militants left in
disgust and quite a few found their way into the ranks of the
Workers International League. A considerable part of the
political work of the WIL was directed towards winning the best
activists of the CP away from the grip of the Stalinist
leadership.</p>


<p>When Joseph Stalin dissolved the Communist
International in 1943, without any reference to its national
sections or the communist rank and file around the world, the WIL
immediately rushed out a pamphlet, directed towards Communist
Party members, explaining how it could have happened. This
document is reprinted in its entirety and forms the fourth part
of this chapter on the war years.</p>


<p>In 1944 the WIL formed the Revolutionary
Communist Party (RCP), the British section of the Fourth
International by, in effect, taking over most of the remnants of
the RSL. By this time, when a victory over Hitler seemed certain,
the RCP found it necessary to counter the campaign of vicious
chauvinism that was being directed against the German nation as a
whole, not only by the capitalist press, but even more
hysterically, by the 'communist' Daily Worker. In fact the nazis
had come to power, above all, with the aim of destroying the
German labour movement and Hitler's accession to power signalled
the wholesale destruction of the flower of the German working
class.</p>


<p>In opposing the crude nationalism of the CP,
therefore, the RCP repeatedly reminded workers how Hitler had
come to power in the first place, and the disgraceful role played
by Stalinism. It re-issued a pamphlet written by Trotsky in 1931
entitled Germany, <em>the Key to the International Situation</em>.</p>


<p>The introduction to this pamphlet (also printed
as an article in the RCP newspaper<em> Socialist Appeal</em>,
reproduced here, describes the baleful role played by the German
Stalinists up to 1933, and the wholehearted support given at the
time by the Communist Party of Great Britain. The RCP pamphlet,
with much other material published in <em>Workers International
News </em>and<em> Socialist Appeal, </em>educated the best
worker-activists about precisely those issues that the CP was
trying to cover up - and still tries to cover up to this day.</p>
