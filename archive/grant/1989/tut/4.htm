   <h4>The Colonial Revolution and Proletarian Bonapartism</h4>
   <h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>Once the capitalist class of Europe had ridden
out the storms and stresses immediately after the second world
war, the political basis had been laid for what turned out to be
a long period of economic upswing. Underpinned by levels of
economic growth that put all previous productive achievements in
the shade, the advanced capitalist countries were thus able to
enjoy decades of relative social peace, in marked contrast to the
instability of the inter-war years.</p>


<p>But in the colonial and ex-colonial countries,
the so-called third world, the post-war decades have been a
period of unprecedented upheaval, characterised by famine, social
unrest, wars, revolutions and counter-revolutions. There have
been mass struggles encompassing tens and hundreds of millions in
Africa, Asia and Latin America. In the course of these movements,
in China, Cuba, Burma, Syria, Kampuchea (Cambodia), Vietnam,
Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia and elsewhere, regimes have been
established, all of which, from the standpoint of pre-war
developments, were new and peculiar. They were revolutionary
formations that resembled neither the revolutionary capitalist
regimes of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, nor the
'classic' workers' government of October 1917.</p>


<p>As was the case with so many post-war political
developments, the colonial revolution was shrouded in mystery and
confusion to the leadership of what remained of the so-called
Fourth International, as well as to the theoreticians of
Stalinism and reformism. Different 'Trotskyist' sects took turns
to idealise Mao Tse Tung, Ho Chi Minh, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara
and others, without a glimmer of understanding about what real
political forces these leaders represented.</p>


<p>It was the Marxist tendency gathered around Ted
Grant which was able to place all these leaders and movements in
their correct context, explaining their origins and development.
The extracts published in this chapter will demonstrate that
these events can be explained, in Marxist terms, by the
fundamental ideas worked out by Trotsky in his Theory of the
Permanent Revolution, but showing how they find a completely
novel and distorted application in the post-war period.</p>


<p>Before the Russian revolution, Trotsky had
argued that the Russian capitalist class, because of its late
entry onto the stage of history, was too weak economically and
politically, too much tied to the old land relations and too
subservient to its stronger international competitors, to lead
the revolution in Russia. At the same time, the many-millioned
peasantry was not able to play an independent political role. The
leading role in the revolution, therefore, could fall only to the
industrial working class, the proletariat, drawing the peasantry
behind it.</p>


<p>But leading the revolution, carrying through
the tasks of the capitalist (democratic) revolution, the
proletariat would be bound by its social character and its
methods of struggle, to progress immediately to the
implementation of socialist tasks, and the establishment of a
workers' state: the dictatorship of the proletariat. Trotsky
accepted that Russia by itself was too backward economically to
construct socialism, but he argued that on a world scale,
capitalism was rotten-ripe for social change.</p>


<p>The Russian revolution, therefore, would begin
what only the workers in the advanced countries could complete.
Borrowing the expression from Marx, Trotsky characterised the
coming revolution in Russia, because of the role of the working
class and the necessity of an internationalist outlook, as a
Permanent Revolution.</p>


<p>The correctness of Trotsky's prognosis, put
forward years in advance, was shown by the process of the
revolution in 1917. After the February revolution had overthrown
the Czar, the capitalist class was utterly incapable of taking
forward or consolidating even the most modest gains of the
revolution. The 'democratic' tasks were in the end only
achieveable by the coming to power of the working class,
supported by the poorer peasants, through the October soviet
revolution.</p>


<p>Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution forms
the starting point of a Marxist description of the revolutionary
processes in the underdeveloped countries: the colonial
revolution. But in the transitional period between capitalism and
the establishment of workers' states the picture has been
enormously complicated: given the delay in the revolution in the
advanced countries, the degeneracy of the world-wide Stalinist
movement and the subsequent absence of mass revolutionary parties
in the third world, all kinds of new social formations unforeseen
by Trotsky have been possible.</p>


<p>Under these conditions, with social and
economic crisis reaching a pitch, it has been possible for the
revolution to unfold, not on the lines of the 'classic' Russian
pattern, but in the manner of a distortion of the Permanent
Revolution. Based upon the already-present model of the
totalitarian bureaucracy in Russia, regimes have been established
on the same lines: with state ownership and planning of the
economy, one-party government and the suppression of democratic
rights. Moreover, these have been established on the basis of
peasant-based wars, with a variety of petit-bourgeois or
Stalinist leaderships, with the working class playing a
relatively minor role.</p>


<p>The following documents show a continuity and
development of the Marxist position on the colonial revolution,
worked out by Ted Grant as the leading theoretician of the RCP,
and further deepened and extended in the period after the RCP
broke up. The first item is an article from the January 1949
issue of <em>Socialist Appeal</em>. The background to this was the
civil war raging in China, between the Peoples' Liberation Army
(or the 'Red Army'), led by Mao Tse Tung, and the 'Nationalist'
forces of the Kuomintang, led by Chiang Kai Shek.</p>


<p>It was clear by this stage that the Red Army,
on the basis of its revolutionary policy towards the land and the
peasantry, was making huge gains. Yet there were still leaders in
the Fourth International who believed that Mao Tse Tung would
make a compromise with Chiang, or even capitulate to him. The
failure of these 'theoreticians' to face the reality that stared
them in the face led to a jibe, in one debate, that 'Mao may want
to surrender to Chiang but the trouble is, he can't catch him!'</p>


<p>Building upon the theoretical work which had
already been undertaken in relation to Russia, Eastern Europe and
the Tito-Stalin split, the article by Ted Grant puts forward a
perspective in relation to China that is lucid and consistent
from a Marxian point of view, and moreover, brilliantly
prophetic. With the world 'leaders of Trotskyism' still humming
and hawing, the article goes straight to the point and applauds
'the destruction of feudalism and large-scale capitalism, in this
important section of Asia, even though it is carried out under
the leadership of Stalinism. In its long-term implications, it is
as important as the October revolution itself.'</p>


<p>While hailing the social change as a huge step
forward for the Chinese masses, the article also anticipates the
setting up of another Moscow-like state: 'only a horrible
caricature of the Marxist conception of the revolution will
result&#133;Mao will look to Russia as his model.'</p>


<p>While all other theoreticians were hesitating
to even accept the possibility of a deformed workers' state in
China, Grant was already several steps ahead, predicting, years
in advance, the inevitability of a break between the two mighty
Stalinist states. Referring to the split that had already erupted
beteen Yugoslavia and Russia, the article concludes: 'It is quite
likely that Stalin will have a new Tito on his hands&#133;Mao
will have a powerful base in China with its 450-500 million
population and its potential resources. The conflicts which will
thus open out should be further means of assisting the world
working class to understand the real nature of Stalinism.'</p>


<p>The clarity of the analysis and the perspective
worked out in the above article did not mean that there was still
not a great deal of confusion and questioning within the
Trotskyist movement, not least in the ranks of the RCP. In a
document that was in many respects typical of the doubts being
raised, an RCP member, David James, wrote <em>Some Remarks on the
Question of Stalinism </em>(dated February 1949). In this he
questioned the conclusions arrived at in relation to China and
Yugoslavia. This was published as a contribution to the internal
discussion in the RCP, and precisely because it did reflect wider
doubts about the leadership's (that is Ted Grant's) position it
warranted a full reply.</p>


<p>This Reply to David James, forms the second
part of this chapter. It deals once again with the Tito-Stalin
split, in the same terms which it is dealt with in the previous
chapter. 'The only difference between the regimes of Stalin and
Tito', it says, 'is that the latter is still in its early stages.
There is a remarkable similarity in the first upsurge of
enthusiasm in Russia, when the bureaucracy introduced the first
Five Year Plan, and the enthusiasm in Yugoslavia today.'</p>


<p>Using the method of Marxism to describe the
regime of Tito, and hence explain the split with Stalin, the
document takes the argument further and extends it to the example
of China. It elaborates further the process by which Mao Tse Tung
established his regime, explaining that it was, of necessity,
'deformed' from the very beginning: 'Basing itself upon the
peasantry, it (the Chinese Stalinist leadership) enters the towns
not with the aim and outlook of a genuine Communist Party, but
with the aim of establishing its power by manoeuvring between the
classes. It does so not by transferring its social basis to the
proletariat - not as the direct representative of the proletariat
as would a Bolshevik party - but in a Bonapartist manner.'</p>


<p>Just as Tito has been able to assert his
independence of Moscow - because he came to power largely through
'his own' Yugoslavian movement - so, therefore, Mao Tse Tung
would also be able to assert his independence, by resting on the
Peoples' Liberation Army and a nation of 500 million&#133;'the
danger of a new and really formidable Tito in China is a factor
which is causing anxiety in Moscow'.</p>


<p>By the late 1950s, the predicted differences
between Chinese and Russian Stalinism had begun to appear.
Exchanges between the Russian leader Nikita Kruschev and Mao Tse
Tung became increasingly bitter until, in mid 1960, there was a
complete rupture, with the Soviet Union withdrawing all the
scientists and technicians previously placed in China to aid its
development. The public divisions between the Moscow and Peking
bureaucracies had a profound effect on the Communist Parties
throughout the capitalist world, with almost all of them
suffering some split to form 'Maoist' parties.</p>


<p>As they had done previously with Tito, a
section of the remnant of the 'Fourth International', now
composed of small ultra-left sects, put Mao on a pedestal and
hailed him as some sort of 'unconscious Trotskyist'. Encouraging
the formation of Maoist Parties, one 'Trotskyist' sect even
managed the brilliant feat of losing its members to the
organisation, the first time in history that a 'Trotskyist' group
participated in creating a Stalinist Party. </p>


<p>The third item in this chapter, <em>The Colonial
Revolution and the Sino-Soviet Split</em>, is a document written
in 1964, and first published by Sussex University Socialist
Society. As the title implies, it once again explains the nature
of the split between the Russian and the Chinese Stalinist
bureaucracies, this time after the event, but it also extends the
analysis of the Chinese revolution to encompass the broader
processes of the colonial revolution.</p>


<p>At this time, at the height of the post-war
boom, the ultra-left sects condemned the working class in the
West as 'bourgeoisified', and turned their attention to the
students and to the struggles for national liberation in the
colonial world. For them, the centre of gravity of the world
revolution was shifted from China to Cuba, from Cuba to Algeria,
from Algeria to Vietnam, on each occasion slavishly and
uncritically supporting the leadership of the liberation
movements.</p>


<p>This document, therefore, was largely a polemic
against these middle-class infatuations, providing a broad review
of the colonial revolution. Building on the analysis first made
in relation to China, it showed how similar processes could take
place in smaller countries, like Burma, Vietnam and Cuba.</p>


<p>Referring to the war of liberation waged by the
Vietnamese workers and peasants against US imperialism, the
document pointed out that a victory for the Vietnamese people
would be an historic step forward. But it correctly predicted
that the regime that would be likely to be installed would be,
like the government in North Vietnam, a deformed workers' state.</p>


<p>The general analysis gave a penetrating insight
into the processes of the colonial revolution as they unfolded in
a number of countries. It pointed to the tendency for the
'statification' of the economy, where there were radical regimes
that faced grave economic crisis and the pressure of the masses,
even though in some cases, like Egypt and Algeria, the process
did not go all the way to the complete expropriation of
landlordism and capitalism.</p>


<p>The fourth section of the chapter, <em>The
Colonial Revolution and the Workers' States</em>, is yet a further
development of the broad themes already worked out above. It was
first published in the <em>Militant International Review</em>, in
July 1978. In the fourteen years since the publication of the
previous document, there had been a number of revolutionary
movements in the third world which had resulted in the formation
of proletarian Bonapartist states on the same lines as China and
Russia.</p>


<p>These included Syria, Vietnam (unifying South
and North), Laos, Kampuchea, Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia. The
formation of these states was consistent with the analysis of the
colonial revolution already worked out in 1949, and elaborated
since then. But in addition, in confirmation of the analysis of
the origins of the Sino-Soviet split, some of the divisions
between different bureaucracies had gone to the point of armed
conflict. There had been armed clashes on the Russian-Chinese
border, and on the Vietnamese borders with Kampuchea and China.
There is no other explanation of the conflict between these
alleged 'socialist' states, other than the basic position
developed by Ted Grant at the time of the Tito-Stalin split,
elaborated in relation to Chinese Stalinism and then further
developed in his writing on the colonial revolution.</p>


<p>Particular attention is paid in this article to
the position of Cuba and Ethiopia. In the case of the latter, a
revolutionary movement overthrew the emperor, Haile Selassi, in
1974, and soon afterwards a military regime around Colonel
Mengistu was consolidated by basing itself on the expropriation
of landlordism and capitalism. This government, however, adopted
the totalitarian methods characteristic of all the third world
Stalinist states. In its policy towards its national minorities,
it was no less repressive than the regime it replaced, and it
became involved in wars against Eritrean guerrillas in the North
and against Somali-backed sucessionists in the Ogaden region.</p>


<p>It was at this point that the Russian
Stalinists switched their support from Somalia (also a
proletarian Bonapartist regime) to Ethiopia and began to give
active assistance to the latter. The sectarian remnant of the old
Fourth International now found itself in the impossible position
of having to explain how a 'healthy workers' state' (Cuba) could
be giving active support to a 'fascist state' (Ethiopia).</p>


<p>Once again, it was only possible to understand
the events through the analysis previously worked out by Ted
Grant, explaining how Stalinist states had come to be created in
both Cuba and Ethiopia. This article, like the previous document,
also illuminates the general processes taking place in the
colonial revolution, referring, for example, to the coup in
Afghanistan in 1978. This coup established the deformed workers'
state which the Moscow bureaucracy set out to shore up by its
invasion a year later, in December 1979.</p>


<p>No study by socialists of the colonial
revolution today would be complete without the solid theoretical
foundation - tested, re-tested and confirmed by events - laid
down by Ted Grant in the form of the items in this chapter, as
well as other related documents and articles by the same author,
too numerous to be included.</p>
