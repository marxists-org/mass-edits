The kept capitalist press, from the <em>Daily Mail</em> to the renegade <em>Daily Worker</em>, has hailed with glee theattitude adopted by the T.U.C. against the German people.</p><p>Oneheadline, taken at random, reads: &#8220;All Germans Guilty Says T.U.C.&#8221; (<em>Daily Sketch</em>). On a card vote of5,056,000 to 1,350,000, the position of the T.U.C.bureaucrats was carried. Anyone who has the slightest contact with the miners,railwaymen and other workers knows that this resolution is a travesty of thefeelings of the organised working class, and even of the more backward sectionswho are unorganised. But the T.U.C. claims to speak intheir name although the workers in the unions were not consulted on thismatter.</p><h4>Citrine in the van of the pack</h4><p class="fst">Inthe van of the pack, in full cry against German workers, was Sir Walter Citrine, General Secretary of the T.U.C. He said:</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;There is no dispute about the punishment of war criminals.The point of controversy arises over the responsibility of the German people asa whole&#8230;</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;It was utterly impossible,&#8221; Sir Walter argued, &#8220;on the onehand to affirm the principle of restoration unless side by side withaffirmation they realised that restoration must be done in the main by theGerman people.</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;Assuming they accepted that reasoning, how in the name of heaven couldthey affirm that the German people were innocent? They would be punishing theinnocent by compelling them&#8212;the people who they thought ought to be absolvedfrom the blame&#8212;to make good the devastation and make some form of reparation.</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;If the principle is laid down that it is just andequitable that Germanyshould make good the devastation,&#8221; Sir Walter declared, &#8220;It follows that therestoration must be done by the German people. What other doctrines can youevolve? I affirm that you will not know for years after the war precisely whatmeasure of responsibility will devolve on any particular section of Germany.</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;When the allies march into Berlinwe shall find so many anti-Nazis that it will be very difficult to know who wascarrying on the war in Germany.That is a contingency we shall have to prepare for&#8230; there is far too much mushysentimentality about this question.</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;Nobody has wanted to see signs of revolt in Germany morethan I have. The T.U.C. has appealed to the German Labour Movement. While Iwould be the last to deny the bravery of individual German trade unionists, Icannot escape the conclusion that there has been no large scale organisedresistance in Germanysince the advent of Hitlerism. It is not pleasant forme to have to say that.&#8221;</p><p>Thehypocrisy and humbug of this is positively repulsive. But it is likely thatwithout the assistance of The Russian Trade Union bureaucrats, who were&#8216;fraternal&#8217; delegates from the Kremlin, the T.U.C. bureaucrats would not havegot away with it so easily. They used the prestige of the heroic Red Army andof the Russian Revolution for the filthy purpose of the imperialists.</p><h4>Kuznetsov sets the tone</h4><p class="fst">Thespeech of Kuznetsov set the tone of the wholeproceedings. It was the most vicious and chauvinistic of all. Betraying all theteachings of Lenin, he gave the most racialist speech of the whole conference.Deliberately and consciously, he identified the German workers and the Germanmasses with their Nazi overlords; the crimes of Hitler&#8217;s S.S.&#8212;he claims&#8212;werethe crimes of the ordinary German workers and soldiers. It was in this mannerthat he attempted to confuse the issue. From these racists there were no tracesof the elementary ideas of internationalism, socialism, or even common humansolidarity:</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;The German fascist invaders must answer for all thesefiendish atrocities,&#8221; Mr. Kuznetsov declared. &#8220;TheSoviet Union stressed the fact that in the reconstruction of the districtsdestroyed, Russiawould need very considerable help. It would be a good thing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if allthose infected with a feeling of leniency towards the fascists [let us rememberhe does not distinguish between the German people and the fascists] were sentfor a short time to the territory where the German invaders ruled. If thesepeople are honest, their soft hearts would, without doubt, become as hard asstone.&#8221;</p><p>Allthis deluge of anti-German propaganda is merely following in the wake of acampaign of race hatred and calumny that Goebbelswould find it hard to beat. As he once waged a campaign against all Jews, sonow the capitalist press here wages a campaign against all Germans. And this isnot done unconsciously. Like Goebbels racial myth,this Vansittartism has a purpose. It is preparationfor the bleeding of Germany.As the <em>Daily Worker </em>cheerfullyheadlines: &#8220;Germanymust pay&#8212;say Soviet and British Trade Unions&#8221;.</p><h4>Betrayal of socialism</h4><p class="fst">Onecannot read the pages of the Labour press, in particular the <em>Daily Worker</em>, without a feeling of shamethat these traitors speak in the name of the working class and of socialism.They have violated every elementary idea developed by the great teachers ofsocialism. You can search the pages of Marx, Engels,and Lenin; even if one reads the old labour pioneers in this country, such asKier Hardy, nowhere can you find anything that could be used to give even ashadow of justification to this criminal policy. How often have the teachers ofsocialism proclaimed that the working class of all countries have nothing togain by war except misery and grief, hardship and death? The German workershave had their full share of misfortune in the present war. The ones who gainout of the war, as in every country, are the big monopolies and trusts, the Nazihierarchy. German workers have gained no more out of this war than the Britishworkers.</p><p>Insteadof attacking the people really responsible, the criminals of finance capital,in Britain as well as in Germany, in Wall Street as well as in Rome, they attempt tocover up the real cause of war. And there is a sinister reason behind thesupport of the T.U.C. leaders and of the Stalinists for a &#8220;hard peace&#8221; for Germany. Theruling classes, as always, are not prepared to destroy private ownership of themeans of production, neither in Britainnor anywhere else. They wish to protect private property in Germany&#8212;andthus the criminals responsible (together with themselves), for this war&#8212;andunload all the burdens of the war onto the shoulders of the German workers. Apartfrom the top leaders of the Nazi movement, not many of the real culprits in Germany willget their deserts at the hands of the allies. <em>But it is to prevent them getting their deserts at the hands of theworkers, soldiers and peasants of Germany that the capitalists aredevoting their efforts.</em> In thisthey are receiving the full support of Stalin and the labour leaders.</p><p>WhenCitrine, the new apostle of the barricades, demandsof the German workers (from the safety of London) that they take action at the barricades;when the Stalinists, the new found lovers of constitutionalism and legality inall the countries of Europe, sneer at the Germans for accepting the rule ofHitler, that is a sight to make the gods laugh. <em>The German workers will yet be on the barricades</em>, as their French brothers have alreadybeen, not because of the appeals of these Pharisees and hypocrites&#8212;but <em>in spite of them</em>.</p><h4>Goebbels grateful to T.U.C. bosses</h4><p class="fst">Ifthe German nation has tolerated Hitler&#8217;s rule during the last five years, theresponsibility for this rests directly on the shoulders of the Citrines, the Lawthers, the Stalins and the Pollitts. It wasthe German people&#8217;s fear of a new and worse Versailles Treaty of enslavementthat led them to see no way out. Today, what holds the Germans workers back,when Hitler has lost what little support he did possess, is the &#8220;hard peace&#8221;which Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin promises them and which the T.U.C.bureaucrats confirmed at the T.U.C. conference. Goebbelshas seized with delight the assistance rendered him by Messrs Citrine, Kuznetsov and Co. TheT.U.C. resolution was broadcast throughout Germany to convince the Germanpeople that the fate of the Nazis and the fate of the masses are boundtogether. &#8220;<em>Enjoy the war, the peace willbe terrible!</em>&#8221; is his latestslogan.</p><h4>Revolts in Germany</h4><p class="fst">While the new fiery warrior, &#8216;Horatio Nelson&#8217; Citrine, has put the telescope to hisblind eye and proclaimed that he sees nothing, <em>revolts and mutinies, strikes and uprisings, have been reported invarious parts of Germany</em>.</p><p>Ifwe had to publish a list of even half of these events, the pages of the <em>Socialist Appeal </em>would be filled&#8212;andthis from the carefully edited reports of the capitalist press.</p><p>Totake a couple, the Vansittart <em>Daily Mail, </em>which can hardly be accused of sympathy for theGermans, reported in its issue of 12<sup>th</sup>October 1944:</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;Industrial disturbances in the Ruhr and Rhineland were themain cause of the long telephone silence between Berlinand Stockholm according to travellers arrivinghere by plane from Germany.Affected centres mentioned are Dusseldorf,Cologne and Saarbrucken, butthe trouble is believed to have spread further afield.&#8221;</p><p>Onthe 15<sup>th</sup> October, W.E. Mundy of the <em>Telegraph</em> reported under the headline &#8220;Peace riots stamped out in Ruhr. S.S. armed with tanks and gas&#8221;:</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;The anti-Nazi demonstration in the Ruhr and Western Germany which I reported recently, and whichflared up again last week prior to the five days Berlin-Sweden telephonesilence, have caused Himmler to issue a savagewarning.</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;He has threatened to send tanks, machine-guns and tear gasto be used by fanatical S.S. youth against German underground factory workers,foreign workers and Wehrmacht officers inside theReich who are trying to undermine the regime. &#8216;&#8230;Any new mutiny in the streetswill be ruthlessly suppressed&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>Thesame newspaper, on the same day, alsoreports:</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;An unconfirmed report, broadcast by F.F.I. Radio Lyonssaid: &#8216;Riots have taken place in Berlin.S.S. troops were called and fired into a crowd demonstrating for peace. One small group of rebelsrouted an S.S. formation&#8217;.&#8221;</p><h4>Why should German workers trust British labour leaders?</h4><p class="fst">Citrine says: &#8220;We appeal to the German workers&#8221;. But whatdoes he offer them? Churchill instead of Hitler?Churchill has always been the enemy of the workers everywhere. But, what iseven more important, why should the German workers trust Citrine?He acknowledges the crimes of the German imperialists (so does even the<em> Daily Mail</em>), and the capitalists fromthe City of London,who financed and helped Hitler to power because it was profitable for them todo so. It is in serving these very same capitalists that Citrinedoes his dirty work. How easy it is for Citrine and Co. to point the finger of scorn at the Germanworkers, yet he remains silent about the vile crimes of the British capitalists&#8212;everybit as bad as those of the Nazis!</p><p>InIndia5 million died of starvation on the direct responsibility of Churchill and hisclass, and now yet another famine is imminent. There was not a word about thisat the T.U.C. conference! <em>Unlike theGerman workers, Citrine does not face the firingsquads and torture chambers of the Gestapo, but yet not a word. Brave Citrine!</em></p><p>Sowhat can the Indian workers think? And the German workers?Is it to this hypocrite they must hearken? The very idea is laughable. &#8220;<em>Look not to the mote in the other man&#8217;s eyebefore you look at the beam in your own</em>.&#8221; When your own hands are clean, Messrs Labour Leaders, you canaccuse others. The Indian workers might just as well say that the Britishworkers are responsible for the 5 million Indian dead, and for the thousandsupon thousands murdered and imprisoned by British imperialists. But we knowthat the British workers are not responsible for these crimes committed intheir name; no more are the German workers responsible for the crimes ofHitler. <em>But Citrine and Stalin bear theirshare of responsibility for both</em>. Thegallant Kuznetzov and his companion had not a word tosay about the atrocities committed under the British flag. They looked withequanimity upon the crimes that took place in India.</p><p>Thesepeople hope that the working class has a short memory. It is not so long agothat Molotov stated that fascism was a matter of &#8220;taste&#8221;, and that the Alliesshould cease fighting against the peace-lover Hitler. It was not so long agothat Pollitt and Co.were proclaiming: </p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;Hitler repeated once again that the war was thrust uponhim by Britain.Against this historical fact there is no reply. Britaindeclared war, not Germany.Attempts were made to end the war, but the Soviet-German peace overtures wererejected by Britain.All through these months the British and French governments have had the powerto end the war, they have chosen to extend it&#8230; war should never have beendeclared on September 3<sup>rd</sup>, there <em>shouldhave been negotiations and peace talks</em>.&#8221; (<em>Daily Worker</em>, Editorial,February 1<sup>st</sup>, 1940).</p><p>Citrine is a good barricade fighter. The<em> Daily Herald </em>editorial on the T.U.C.remarked that the German people must be sternly dealt with, because &#8220;theyquailed at the barricades.&#8221; But Citrine, too, musthope that the masses have short memories. Do you remember, Citrine,the T.U.C. Conference of 1935? Did you think you were speaking in the name ofthe British workers when, at Brighton in 1933,you said:</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;All I can say is that a general strike wasdefinitely planned and projected, but the German leaders had to giveconsideration to the fact that a general strike after the atmosphere created bythe Reichstag fire, and with six and a half million unemployed, was an actfraught with the gravest consequences which might be described as nothing lessthan civil war.&#8221;</p><p>ThusCitrine justified the cowardice and treachery of hisbrother Social Democrat leaders in Germany for refusing to lead theGerman workers<em>who were willing and eager tostruggle </em>against the Nazis<em>. </em>And this even <em>after</em>Hitler was in power. Faced with thesame position in Britainwe cannot doubt that he and his colleagues would behave in the same treacherousand cowardly fashion. Yet he and others of his ilk slander the German workers.</p><p>Thisis the real Citrine. Together with the Stalinists,you, Citrine, are responsible for the victory ofHitler; you betrayed the German workers then, as you are betraying the Britishand German workers now.</p><h4>They fear international solidarity</h4><p class="fst">Citrine and Stalin do not want to punish the German workersbecause those workers do not revolt, but <em>becausethey are going to revolt</em>. They fear that the German workers will gain thesupport of the British workers. Despite the Gestapo and the S.S., the ordinaryGermans fraternised with the peoples of Europe.Special orders had to be issued to the German soldiers threatening them if theyfraternised with the population in Russia and other countries. <em>In Russia the German soldiers gavetheir rations to starving women and children</em>. They know that the British soldiers will behave in the same way inGermany.That is why new military orders have been issued threatening the Germans withpunishment if they dare to get on friendly terms with Allied soldiers. But thiscampaign will be in vain.</p><p>Ajournalist writes in the <em>Express </em>fatalistically:</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;How are you going to stop the British soldier from beingfriendly to the German civilians once he gets into Germany? I suppose it can be done,but it is difficult to see how. If nature takes its course, he will hand outhis chocolate to the babies, and his rations and cigarettes to the hungryparents.</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;I am only going by what has happened in Italy, and around a thousand prisoners&#8217; cagesall the way from here to Africa.&#8221;</p><p>Theterrible thing is that the class conscious workers whose normal reactions wouldbe those of international class solidarity are precisely the ones whose leaders&#8212;orrather &#8216;misleaders&#8217;&#8212;are leading them down reactionary paths.Instead of agitating among their more backward fellow workers on internationallines of class solidarity, those workers influenced by Citrine,and especially by the &#8220;Communist&#8221; Party, propagate Vansittartdoctrines. Therein lies the danger to socialism in Europe. Under these conditions the first duty and thefirst task of all genuine class conscious workers is to ceaselessly counterthese vile activities.</p><p>Britishworkers!Don&#8217;t be fooled! They are playing with your lives and your future. Ifyou allow yourselves to help in the crushing of German workers, you arepreparing the same medicine for yourselves.</p><p>Socialistworkers!Do not listen to Citrine!</p><p>Communistworkers!Do not be fooled by Pollitt!</p><h4>Rebuild a Socialist Europe</h4><p class="fst">Rememberthe teachings of the great socialist leaders. In the last war the GermanJunkers and Generals&#8212;like the British capitalists and Generals&#8212;plundered,burned, and murdered in Russia,just as the Nazis have done in this war. <em>YetLenin always distinguished between two Germanys</em>&#8212;<em>the Germanyof the workers and the Germanyof the capitalists, and two Britains</em>&#8212;<em>the Britainof the workers and the Britainof the capitalists</em>.</p><p>Butthe question will be asked: how is the ruin and damageto be paid for, and the reconstruction of Europeto be achieved? To socialist workers the answer is simple: <em>Lenin&#8217;s way. Expropriate all the criminals responsible for the war, who sit not only in Berlin,but in London, Paris,and New York.</em></p><p>Asocialist Europe, with the voluntary and enthusiastic co-operation of theGerman people, with the skill of German labour and German technique, would meana new life for Europe, a new standard of living for the whole of Europe, and a new and higher culture for all of humanity.The German workers would gladly give their all in sacrificing and building forthe benefit of all Europe. But a capitalist Germany,capitalist reparations, and a capitalist &#8220;hard peace&#8221; will bring nothing buthunger to the German workers. It will also bring hunger to the British, French,and other workers too. A perpetuation of hatred will mean new wars. The defeatof Germanydoes not end war; on the contrary, it prepares the way for new wars between thevictors. If you do not destroy the cause of war and fascism&#8212;its parent, capitalism&#8212;thesecalamities will be inflicted with tenfold severity on the peoples of the world.</p><ul class="disc">	<li>	Down with Vansittartism!	</li>	<li>	Protest in your branch against the Vansittart resolution of the T.U.C.!	</li>	<li>	For the hand of friendship and fraternity to the	German workers!	</li>	<li>	For a socialist Germany	in a socialist Europe!	</li></ul><p class="fst"><span class="inote">[Editor&#8217;s Note: This article was published also as a   pamphlet (no date) under the title, &#8220;T.U.C. helps Hitler&#8212;Labour   and Stalinist Leaders Betray the German Workers.&#8221;]</span></p>
