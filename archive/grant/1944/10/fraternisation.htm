<p class="fst"><em>The allies have entered Germany and already in the tiny
corner they occupy, they have shown their aims and
intentions.</em></p>

<p>A hard and merciless peace against the Germans, has been
promised. The generosity of Versailles is not to be repeated. The
suggestion is made that Germany is to be occupied by the Great
Powers for 10 years or more. Threats of dismemberment, handing the
Rhineland to France; East Prussia, Silesia and Pomerania up to the
Oder to the Poles; bits and pieces to Holland, Belgium and Denmark;
and threats that Germany will be divided in two as Separate
entities - all this is held out to the German masses as the happy
result of Allied victory.</p>

<p>No wonder they have resisted desperately both in the East and in
the West.</p>

<p>And now, this very resistance engendered by Allied policy is to
be used as the excuse for the carrying out of their threats! Here
we have a vicious circle. <em>But an intentional one</em>. The Allied
imperialists <em>want</em> the Germans to resist. They <em>want</em>
the German workers to fight desperately. Even though this may mean
the lives of tens and hundreds of thousands of British, American,
and Russian soldiers.</p>

<p>In an article in the <em>Daily Express</em>, as early as the 28th
March of this year, called &quot;Why Don't the Germans Crack?&quot; written
by Paul Holt, the comment is made that 6 million of the German
people at that date were already homeless.</p>

<p>When Hitler sent troops marching in for the occupation of
Hungary, to keep Horthy's tail up, the news was received throughout
Germany with &quot;utter apathy&quot;.</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;Then what keeps the Germans steady? Fear. Strength through fear
is what they've got.&quot;</p>

<p>Holt cynically goes on to comment:</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;The march of events and the pronouncements of the leaders of
their enemies huddle them together and deprive them of their last
alibi.&quot;</p>

<p class="fst">Where else can they turn but to the Nazis who brought all this
upon them? What other power or strength do they have to turn to?
Since they must die as a nation by the sword, they resolve to live
a little longer by the sword.</p>

<p>And, reviewing this, the Allied leaders are content... Thus, the
responsibility for the support of Hitler rests entirely on the
shoulders of Allied imperialism.</p>

<p>Yet despite this, in spite of all the crimes of Allied
imperialism, their knowledge of what awaits them should they be
defeated, the resistance of the German workers against Hitler has
been growing greater and greater in the last period. It is now a
race between the Allies and the revolution. Which will conquer
first. Even the capitalist press, rigidly censored, day by day,
reveals what is taking place in Germany.</p>

<p>The <em>Daily Telegraph</em> of May 1st, reports of a revolt in
Dresden as follows:</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;After a revolt recently by anti-Nazi elements in Dresden, the
bodies of hundreds of rioters who had been shot were left lying in
the streets as a warning to others.&quot;</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;...The immediate cause of the revolt is not clear, but it is
known that the anti-Nazi element among the workers is increasing
rapidly in the city.&quot;</p>

<p class="fst">The <em>Journal de Gen&egrave;ve</em> in an article
entitled &quot;The Struggle Against Defeatism in Germany&quot;, says:</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;In a big town in Southern Germany executions take place at
least three times a week. This town is no exception. Even so, the
fate of its inhabitants appears almost enviable compared with that
of Berliners or Viennese.&quot;</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;I am alluding only to the executions of civilians - that is to
say, saboteurs, defeatists, disparagers of the regime, enemy
agents, etc. The German 'resistance' also has its victims. They are
mostly workers and shopkeepers,&quot; says the writer.</p>

<p class="fst">Dozens of reports have come through recently, of strikes,
mutinies, armed clashes and rebellions inside Germany. The most
recent being reported in the <em>Evening Standard</em> on September
23rd, 1944:</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;The miners of Saarbrcken have left the pits and are on
strike.&quot;</p>

<p class="fst">The terror in Germany has reached the greatest heights since the
coming to power of Hitler. Tens of thousands are being arrested,
thousands murdered in the concentration camps. Workers in Austrian
factories came out on strike after the murder of
Th&auml;mann and Breitscheid. Two thousand planes
have been kept in reserve by Himmler to deal with the home front,
according to the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>.</p>

<p>It is significant that all news of the class struggle in Britain
and America has been suppressed by Goebbels' censorship. The
strikes of the miners in Britain and America were never reported to
the German workers for fear that this would reveal to the German
masses that there were two Britains and two Americas as well as two
Germanies; not only the Britain of Churchill but the Britain of
John MacLean; not only the America of Roosevelt, but the America of
Eugene Debs.</p>

<p>This is the greatest crime of the British Labour and Communist
Party leaders: that they, who have a relative amount of freedom,
are preparing to support the repression of the German masses who
are conducting the struggle so heroically against great odds,
especially the odds of the Allied terms.</p>

<p>These smooth-tongued traitors, viciously slander the German
masses and prepare to justify the imposition of imperialist
repression on the German masses as bad as the slave regime imposed
by Hitler in France and other European countries, and to justify
the reduction of the German masses to a condition of colonial
servitude like that of the Indians. Lenin said that the Versailles
Treaty had reduced the German people to that of a colonial or
semi-colonial bondage. Now, Stalin goes the whole hog. In
justification for his policy, the Moscow radio broadcasts:</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;The world has begun to generalise. There is now little
difference made between Nazis and Germans. This difference will
soon disappear completely.&quot;</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;If Hitler is not overthrown now by the Germans themselves, the
German nation may miss the last, the very last chance of
reconciliation of forgiveness, even of mercy.&quot;</p>

<p class="fst">The plans for Germany are revealed in all their stark reaction.
Eisenhower announces in a proclamation that they come, not as
&quot;oppressors&quot; of the Germans from the yoke of the Nazis, but as
&quot;conquerors&quot;. The difference between &quot;oppression&quot; and conquest will
be difficult to find when one reads the decrees of the military
government. They contain the following provisions:</p>

<p>Curfew from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Travel forbidden without a special
pass. Gatherings of more than 5 people for the purpose of
discussion in either public or private, are prohibited. Firearms to
be given up.</p>

<p>Newspapers, publications and posters of any kind will not be
printed, disseminated nor posted. Public officials to stay at their
posts.</p>

<p>These provisions establish Hitlerism without Hitler. The racial
doctrine of the Nazis, but applied now to the Germans - and all
this in the name of &quot;extirpating Hitlerism&quot;! Those provisions of
the decrees banning the Nazi Party, its insignia and banners are
meant clearly to throw dust in the eyes of the British and American
people. The masses have no love for Hitler and once the S.S. and
Gestapo have been removed they would automatically disappear
without the &quot;aid&quot; of Eisenhower. On the contrary, far from
destroying the Nazis - especially the bureaucrats who have
faithfully carried out their crimes - these measures are meant to
protect them. In this town an &quot;independent&quot; Nazi has already been
appointed mayor - and this is in keeping with the policy of the
Allies.</p>

<p>In an editorial in the <em>Manchester Guardian</em> of 8th August,
1944, they cynically remark:</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;To whom will the occupying armies turn for help in
administration if not to the Nazi bureaucracy?&quot;</p>

<p class="fst">Had the Allies been really interested in smashing the Nazis
instead of preventing elections, they would hold a democratic
election; instead of preventing political expression in newspapers,
they would encourage it.</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;They [the Germans] don't seem to labour under the delusion of
having lost their freedom to conquerors because they are accustomed
to not having any - or rather they feel merely that they have
passed from one form of military discipline to another.&quot;</p>

<p class="fst">Here is the secret of this poisonous campaign, of this Hitlerite
racialism, on the part of British and American imperialism and
their lackeys. It is not because the masses in Germany support
Hitler, but because they are against Hitler. The German workers
have gone through the experience of Kaiserism, &quot;democracy&quot;,
Fascism, what else have they left except Socialism? And the ruling
class are preparing to out-Hitler Hitler in bloody repressions
against the German masses. In this, of course, they will receive
the support of the very elements who organised Hitler: the
capitalists, generals and the Nazi bureaucrats. They will become
Allied Quislings.</p>

<p>It is not they who will be suppressed and suffer; it is the
German workers, peasants and middle class. But the German workers
will resist with desperation this repression which will not differ
in the least from that of Hitler, except that it comes from a
foreign oppressor. In spite of all, the German masses have resisted
and are resisting the Nazis. How much more so will they resist
Allied oppression?</p>

<p>But the Allies are anxious because it is not merely the German
masses they have to deal with, but their own workers too. The
workers are supporting the war because they wish to wipe out
Hitlerism, but they have no quarrel with the ordinary German
workers, women and children. That is why the imperialists - not
content with their lies that a German and a Nazi is one and the
same - have poured forth a spate of propaganda in the last few
weeks that the Nazis are preparing to &quot;go underground&quot; in Germany.
This propaganda is nothing but a preparation for repression against
the German workers. They are expecting resistance and this is their
method of preparing to meet it. The example of Italy has shown that
once the masses are free from the iron heel of Fascism, it is not
so easy to replace it. According to the reports in the capitalist
press itself, the Republican Fascists have utterly failed to gain
any support except from a few crack-brains and cranks in Southern
Italy. And in the North, despite German bayonets, hundreds, and
even thousands of Fascists have been murdered by the workers.</p>

<p>British workers! Do not be deceived! And the British workers
will not be deceived. Already, Stalin and his hacks together with
the capitalist press in Britain and America, are holding up their
hands in horror at what is taking place in Germany. The <em>News
Chronicle</em> of September 22nd, 1944 reports:</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;The Soviet press has expressed its relief and satisfaction at
the strong protests raised in this country against the first
symptoms of fraternisation by Allied troops with German
civilians.</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;The Red Army has behaved with perfect propriety to the civilian
populations in its advance towards Berlin, and will doubtless
continue to do so. But what the Russians fear is a growth of an
easy-going temper among the Western Allies which might emasculate
the peace terms.</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;They say with stern clarity that punishment for a terrible
crime against humanity must precede rehabilitations - and that if a
repetition of the crime is to be prevented the German people must
accept their share of the responsibility.&quot;</p>

<p class="fst">The British and the American armies have issued stern orders
against fraternisation with the Germans under penalty of severe
punishment. As these reports indicate, within 24 hours of the
American army reaching Germany, fraternisation had already begun.
If that is the position now, what will it be when the Allied armies
reach the big industrial centres in Germany: Cologne, Berlin and
Hamburg?</p>

<p>The American and British workers will not allow themselves to be
converted into S.S. and Gestapo executioners. Inevitably, they will
fraternise, in spite of all orders with the German workers and
peasants. In the House of Lords, one of the commanders who had
experience of this fraternisation which compelled the withdrawal of
the Allied armies after the last war, warned of the necessity to
send the wives and children of the soldiers of the occupying force
to Germany. The fears of the ruling class are justified. In the
place of reactionary racialism and nationalism which lays the seeds
of new world wars, the class solidarity of the workers will break
through in spite of the sell-out of the Labour and Stalinist
leadership.</p>

<p>The workers of Germany and Britain will fight for a Socialist
Germany and a Socialist Britain in a Socialist Europe.</p>
