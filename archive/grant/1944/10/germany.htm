      <h4>The German Revolution and the future</h4>
      <p>The entry of Allied troops into Germany marks  the beginning of the end for German imperialism and for the Nazis. The complete  collapse of the Hitler regime cannot be long delayed. In four years the swing  of the pendulum has brought German imperialism from the attainment of its dream  of European domination to the position of imminent dismemberment and  powerlessness. There have been few changes in the history of warfare and of the  relations between the nations so graphic and so speedy. But in them is  reflected the instability of relations between the nations and the social  contradictions within the nations themselves.</p>
	  
      <p>
        In 1940, Trotsky wrote commenting on Hitler&rsquo;s  victories:</p>
	  
      <p class="quote">
  &ldquo;The political map has been reshaped with equal  speed in no other epoch save that of the Napoleonic wars. At that time it was a  question of outlived feudal states which had to give way before the bourgeois  national state. Today it is a question of outlived bourgeois states which must  give way before the Socialist Federation of the peoples.&rdquo;</p>
	  
      <p>
        For from Hitler&rsquo;s defeats refuting, they serve to confirm the idea here  expressed. It is the contradictions of world capitalism and the extension of  the war to a world, rather than a European arena (which these contradictions  made inevitable), which have led to Hitler&rsquo;s undoing on the military field.  Moreover, there is a profound significance in the fact that the heart of  Hitler&rsquo;s <em>Wehrmacht</em> was torn out on  the plains of the Ukraine and the banks of the Volga. In however distorted a  form, it was a reflection of the superiority of the coming new society of  socialism over decaying capitalism. This in itself is an indication of the  decline and decay of the bourgeois system.</p>
	  
      <p>
        But in conquering Europe, and in his attempts to  hold it down, Hitler had undermined completely the social basis which  capitalism possessed. In so doing, the Nazis have left a legacy to the  &ldquo;victors&rdquo;, a legacy of social storms and convulsions never before attained in  the rich history of the Old Continent which once dominated all others.</p>
	  
      <p>
        In articles reflecting the bourgeois disquiet, the <em>Economist</em> has pointed out that the middle class in France and other  occupied countries has been reduced to a fraction of what it was, as the result  of the Nazi demand for factory workers, the ruin occasioned by the war, general  dislocation, lack of supplies except for war industry, bombing, etc. In the  rural areas, though on a smaller scale, the same process has taken place. This,  coupled with the tremendous psychological shock occasioned by the events of the  war, the collaboration of the bourgeoisie of the defeated countries with the  invaders, has undermined the former habitual acceptance of bourgeois domination  over the nation. Not alone the working class, but the <em>peasant and  petit-bourgeois masses </em>inevitably will seek revolutionary solutions to the  unbearable agony to which they have been brought by the capitalist regime. The  harsh school, through which they are going, will teach the masses rapidly. All  the political trends and tendencies will come up for judgment as to their  capacity to deliver the goods.</p>
	  
      <p>
        The crisis of the bourgeois regime is far more  profound than it was in 1918. The shocks involved with the collapse of Fascism  in Italy are but the shadow of coming events.</p>
      <h4>No stable counter-revolutionary capitalist armies  in Europe</h4>
      <p>It is a fact which has escaped attention in the working class press, but  a factor of profound importance, that <em>in all Europe there is not a single  stable bourgeois army</em>, which will be left after the destruction of the  German army. A startling fact upon which &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; pessimists could well  ponder! The French army has vanished, and the army assembled at Algiers would  hardly fulfill the purpose. The Italian army and those of the Low Countries  have been dissolved. Poland&rsquo;s pitiful <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;</em> army, though selected and organised for the purpose, could hardly fill the  bill. In the Balkans, the armies of Greece and Yugoslavia have been smashed and  those of Romania and Bulgaria which have managed formally to retain their form,  are already in a shaky condition. If we include the British as a European army,  it is composed dominantly of workers whose ranks are so imbued with an  anti-capitalist and even socialist consciousness, that it would be impossible  to use it for a protracted period for punitive or repressive purposes. Once  Hitler has vanished, in the consciousness of this fine proletarian material,  the reason for their presence in Europe will have disappeared as well.</p>
	  
      <p>
        There remains of the bourgeois armies, only the  extra European forces of American imperialism. Politically they are extremely  backward. And it is on this backwardness that world imperialism is relying to  save the situation in Europe. But the Achilles heel of the American colossus  lies in the fact that this mass of soldiery is completely lacking in a cohesive  ideology. Most of the American soldiers are indifferent to the propaganda of  American imperialism on the aims of the war. Those who are at all politically  conscious desire the liquidation of Fascism&nbsp;  &ndash; but all are unanimous in a desire to &ldquo;go home.&rdquo; Those who have been  affected by the reactionary propaganda, tend to direct their animosity against  the Japanese rather than against the Germans. Once Hitler has disappeared, in  an atmosphere of universal hostility, the American army too will rapidly become  demoralised if used against any section of the European workers. Their desire  to return to the States will become transformed into political opposition to  the ruling class.</p>
	  
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the bureaucrats in control of the Red  Army are more terrified even than those in control of the imperialist armies at  the possibility lodged in a mingling of the Red Army soldiers with the workers  and peasants of Germany. They have endeavoured by every means in their power to  create a wall of hatred between them. Preparations have been made to use the  Red Army to crush completely any tendency in the direction of Socialist  revolution on the part of the German working class. But immediately the masses  in Germany move in the direction of uprising and reprisals against the Nazis  and the German ruling class, in Soviet occupied areas it will have a profound  effect on the workers and peasants comprising the Red Army. It will tend to  rekindle the flame of the October Revolution. Thus as a stable and sure base  for capitalist counter-revolution and occupation, the Red Army would be even  more unstable than any other.</p>
	  
      <p>
        This is the background on which events in  Germany will develop &ndash; a background of revolutionary disturbances and  convulsions throughout Europe.</p>
      <h4>Ideological preparation for Allied repression in  Europe</h4>
      <p>Inside Germany all the conditions have matured  for social explosions. Revolution is inevitable. If it is assumed that the  Allies should succeed in occupying Germany before the revolution breaks out,  this could only temporarily delay the d&eacute;nouement.  Inevitably, an upsurge would develop uniting the mass of the people behind the  working class in its struggle for emancipation from social and national  enslavement. Taking a leaf out of Hitler&rsquo;s book, the Allies intend imposing a  regime on Germany similar to that imposed by the Nazis on France and other  countries they have overrun. They can only do this by the use of the same  methods of terror, tortures and reprisals by means of which the Gestapo and the  S.S. maintained their short-lived and precarious occupation of the countries  overrun. The Allies will achieve even less success in their endeavours to hold  down the population of Germany.</p>
	  
      <p>
        In their endeavour to prepare the way  psychologically for their reprisals and executions, as a means of terrorising  the masses in Germany into submission, the Allies have in recent weeks begun a  sustained campaign of hatred and vilification against the German people as a  whole. The myth that the Nazis and the German people are one and the same  thing, and that all Germans are by innate nature &ldquo;Huns&rdquo;, &ldquo;war-loving&rdquo;,  &ldquo;brutal&rdquo;, &ldquo;fascist beasts&rdquo;, &ldquo;murderers&rdquo;, etc., without the slightest spark of  human decency, is being systematically propagated. The undoubted atrocities  which the depraved elements of the S.S. and the Nazis have perpetrated against  the peoples of Europe, serve as the ostensible excuse for the legend that the  whole of the German nation is responsible. It is conveniently forgotten by the  gentry manufacturing this hatred, that the S.S. learned its sadism in action  against the worker-socialists, communists and trade unionists in Germany itself.  And that this savagery had begun even prior to Hitler&rsquo;s coming to power. They  wish the masses to overlook the delight with which <em>they</em> regarded  Hitler&rsquo;s oppression of the German masses, and the approval with which it was  regarded by the democratic statesmen, as a safeguard against socialist  revolution. But in both cases they are remaining true to their aims. Behind the  support for Hitler, as behind the attack on the German masses as &ldquo;poisoned  Hitlerites&rdquo;, <em>lies the same class motive: fear of the socialist revolution</em>.</p>
	  
      <p>
        From a somewhat similar angle can be explained  the rabid chauvinism and race hatred preached by the Kremlin. The cooperation  with Hitler in the Stalin-Hitler Pact, and now the frenzied and insane  denunciation of everything German, in reality present the same symmetrical  pattern: <em>fear of the socialist revolution in Germany and its threat to the  power and privileges of the Stalinist bureaucracy</em>.</p>
	  
      <p>
        On this question all the forces of the old  society are united. Though of course, they intend to utilise the position to  squeeze all they can out of the German masses in their own interests.</p>
      <h4>The German people under the Nazis</h4>
      <p>Hitler, having come to power, crushed the  working class with the aid of the middle class, then speedily turned on the deluded petit-bourgeois. That was the significance of the June 30th  purge of 1934. Having duped the middle class with demagogic phrases and  propaganda against the combines, the Nazi dictatorship revealed itself as the ferocious agent of finance capital. If the middle class had been ruined in the  &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; Weimar republic this was as nothing to the state to which they  were reduced under the Nazis, crippling taxation and the wiping out of large  sections of the middle class as a social grouping were speeded up beyond  anything which had obtained in pre-Nazi Germany.</p>
	  
      <p>
        Incapable of solving the crisis of German capitalism the bloated Nazi bureaucracy had no course other than war. Nazism was revealed as the  &ldquo;chemically distilled essence of the pure culture of imperialism&rdquo;. But on this road, weakened German capitalism could only travel by forcing the masses to tighten their belts even further. &ldquo;Guns before butter&rdquo; was the grim programme of the Nazis before the present war began.</p>
	  
      <p>
        In the six years between the Nazis coming to power and the invasion of Poland, the mass basis of the Nazis had largely disappeared. The mass of the working class <em>never</em> supported them. The middle class had become disillusioned. The victories of 1939-40 may have resulted in a temporary wave of chauvinism, but this was rapidly dissipated by  the horrors of the war against the Soviet Union. One thing alone has paralysed  the German masses from taking action against the hated regime, <em>and that has been the fear of the  consequences of Allied victory.</em></p>
	  
      <p>
        Neither in the East from the side of Stalin, nor in the West from the  Allies, has any attractive alternative been offered to them. Indeed, the  threats emanating from the Soviet Union have been even more frightening  to the masses than from the Allied imperialists. Thus, Stalin has presented  Goebbels with the &ldquo;secret weapon&rdquo; by means of which &ldquo;national unity&rdquo; in the  Reich has been maintained.</p>
	  
      <p>
        But a &ldquo;national unity&rdquo; founded on fear of the consequences of defeat, and  backed with the terror of the S.S. and the Gestapo, cannot be maintained  indefinitely in the face of the mounting catastrophes suffered by the Nazi  regime. The disintegration of the Nazi Reich proceeds apace. Germany is now  almost the last of the Nazi-occupied countries. The tens and thousands of  arrests of anyone who could be remotely suspected of opposition, and dangerous  thoughts towards the regime, are an indication of this. More and more, as the  masses become bitter and resentful, the Nazis are like conquerors in a foreign  land. The newspapers report of Hamburg&mdash;<em>Red  Hamburg</em>&mdash;that large numbers of the S.S. men have been found either knifed,  or with their heads battered in&mdash;<em>but with  their weapons stolen</em>. It is reported that S.S. and Gestapo men dare not move  about in the large industrial cities of Germany at night singly&mdash;but go in pairs  and groups&mdash;so many have been found dead, their firearms missing. Instructive  episodes! They mirror the intensity of the hatred towards the regime which  surely must be the greatest in history and&mdash;the thirst for revenge on the part  of the German masses.</p>
	  
      <p>
        All the conditions for revolutionary upheaval are now present. It but  requires some accident which will set the workers of one large industrial city  in Germany into open collision with the Nazis, and all Germany will be plunged  into the Revolution. It is similar to the situation in Italy before the fall of  Mussolini, except that in Germany the masses are fearful of the Allies [sic] if  they gain the opportunity of marching [sic]  German Revolution must burst forth in a far more gigantic explosion than in the  Italian peninsula.</p>
      <h4>Splits in the German ruling class</h4>
      <p>The knowledge of the inevitability of defeat, and the pressure of the  masses from below, has already led the German bourgeoisie to attempt to rid  themselves of the mascot Hitler, now transformed into a millstone around their  necks. This in itself, is a symptom of the revolutionary crisis in Germany. <em>As always, in history, the coming of the  revolution is marked by irreparable fissures and antagonisms opening out within  the ranks of the ruling class itself.</em></p>
	  
      <p>
        Under an open dictatorship, this always manifests itself in plots and  conspiracies. The Generals&rsquo; revolt, and the reports which indicate an Allied,  or even entirely separate conspiracy on the part of certain groupings of  industrialists, were manifestations of this process in Germany. But neither the  Generals nor the industrialists were completely united on the need or the time  to rid themselves of the Nazis. The same cause which propelled a desperate  section forward momentarily paralysed and terrified other sections. Their  attention was riveted on events in Italy where the removal of Mussolini <em>provoked, </em>instead of <em>forestalling</em>,  the revolutionary storm. The freshness of these events and the under-current of  social antagonisms now rising openly to the surface, convinced them that the  removal of Hitler if anything would provoke even worse consequences for their  class.</p>
	  
      <p>
        Moreover, Hitler and his group of human scum, thugs and adventurers, had  no intention of retiring from the scene to suit their paymasters, who no longer  had any use for them. They did not intend to be cast aside, like the  bourgeoisie toss away their worn-out mistresses. They too had observed the  events in Italy and attempted to profit by the lesson. This hooligan gang had  nothing to gain and would lose all by such a change&mdash;including also their lives.  They had no particular regard for &ldquo;Germany&rdquo;, whether bourgeois or any other  Germany, except from the point of view of milking her. These gangsters have  sown such a harvest of hatred and scorn that there is no way out for  them&mdash;they act with the desperation of cornered rats. And the German bourgeoisie  which only yesterday had luscious visions of exploiting all Europe, finds itself  incapable of asserting immediate control on Germany&mdash;the forces they have raised  from the depths of society have expropriated them politically, and attempt to  act as an independent force threatening even the members of the bourgeoisie  itself.</p>
	  
      <p>
        Thus it is revealed that in the dialectics of  class rule the pattern is not at all simple, but extremely complex.</p>
      <h4>Allied plans after Hitler&rsquo;s fall</h4>
      <p>However, measures of terror cannot save Hitler. Even if by some miracle  the Nazis could stave off military defeat for a time (and this is not entirely  excluded by the relationship of forces), the inevitable collapse of the regime  from internal explosions is drawing near. The desperation of the regime is but  a reflection of the desperation of the masses. Firing squads, arrests, terror,  concentration camps are all useless for a regime which has completely outlived  itself. There is not a live thread in the whole structure left. Even the S.S.  and the Gestapo have no faith in the future, and large numbers are seeking for  a way to save themselves. In addition to which the war has compelled the  breaking down of the S.S., which is no longer a carefully selected instrument  of suppression, but has been diluted with large numbers of fresh  elements and even foreign mercenaries with an entirely different training and  outlook to the old members. Even these latter cannot remain unaffected by the  prevailing mood among the bulk of the population in Germany. Hitlerism is in  its death agony. The piling up of contradictions has reached such a degree of  intensity that it .has gone far beyond the limits which any society  can bear.</p>
	  
      <p>
        What will he the exact course of developments, it would be impossible to  predict. All that can be laid down is the general course of events that will  ensue. One of the factors which dictates the pathological campaign against the  Germans by the Stalinists and the bourgeoisie, is their fear of the tradition  of the German workers. Numerically the strongest sector of the European  proletariat, <em>the German workers have a  tradition of education on the ideas of Marxism which extends back for more than  two generations.</em> Under the influence of the crisis, these ideas must  inevitably be revived with tenfold strength, especially within the vanguard,  now that the masses have gone through the hell of fascism. Hitler has drained  the social reserves of German capitalism. The middle class&mdash;whittled down to a  shadow of what it was before Hitler&mdash;or even before the war&mdash;can no longer  provide a stable basis for reaction. On the contrary, the pendulum must  inevitably swing in the opposite direction. The middle class, which drew behind  it sections of the backward workers in its period of counter-revolutionary  frenzy, will follow the lead of the workers in a new revolutionary upsurge.</p>
	  
      <p>
        If in France, Italy and other countries, the workers have immediately  taken to the road of mass expropriations, and arrests of the employers; if  there is the tendency to the setting up of Soviets and workers&rsquo; committees; if  the workers immediately begin to seize factories and to arm themselves in order  to make themselves master of the situation once the pressure of the Nazi  military machine was released&mdash;what will the position bein Germany? Inevitably in a situation of chaos and ruin, the  masses will be impelled to settle accounts with the Nazis in the most ruthless  fashion. Almost automatically on the morrow of a successful uprising against  Hitler, the workers&rsquo;, soldiers&rsquo; and peasants&rsquo; committees would be compelled to  attempt to assert control of Germany: the socialist revolution would pose  itself as the sole solution.</p>
	  
      <p>
        An  uprising on these lines has already been envisaged in the calculations of  Anglo-American imperialism. Churchill&rsquo;s statement in Parliament that the  &ldquo;Germans&rdquo; could not escape responsibility for their crimes by turning to  Communism was a warning in advance of the repression of the Allies in that  event. But the consequences for Europe and the world of such a movement, would  slip beyond the control of the imperialists. Revolutionary convulsions as far  away as Asia and Africa would be felt among the already restless colonial  slaves of the imperialists.</p>
	  
      <p>
        Accepting the worst variant in developments in  the immediate future&mdash;that Hitler could succeed in holding down the population  till the Allies march in and occupy the whole of Germany, and that the fall of  Nazism takes place through its military debacles&mdash;what follows would be a  different pattern to the one sketched above certainly! But how different? From  the Nazis oppressing the German workers, the German workers would become  oppressed not only socially but nationally as well, by the foreign conquerors.</p>
	  
      <p>
        And what can the bourgeoisie of Germany, or the Allies, offer any  section of the German population? Under present conditions, the Allies as well  as the German bourgeoisie regard the existence of a democratic regime as  dangerous, because it could not be long lasting. Hence the programme of the  German bourgeoisie cannot <em>but</em> be, to  accept the position of a satellite of Anglo-American Imperialism&mdash;of Quislings.</p>
	  
      <p>
        The Allies intend to place themselves in the position formerly occupied  by the Nazis, but hope to retain the present political relationships intact.  Everything is to remain unchanged! With or  without the Allies, the Nazi Party would disappear&mdash;and its existence [??] would extremely embarrass the Allies at home.  They still have to maintain the pretense of a war to exterminate Fascism and  too open a revelation of their aims would provoke repercussions among their own  working class. Consequently, a few hundreds of the Nazi tops would have to be  removed as a gesture to satisfy the &ldquo;mob&rdquo;. But as for the rest, <em>the Nazi bureaucracy and the Capitalists  would remain as subordinate partners of the Imperialists</em>. The system of  repression established by Hitler&mdash;except the racial discrimination against the  Jews, the abolition of which would not cost the Allies anything, and would be  an inexpensive gesture, would remain in operation with additional  &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; such as the curfew. The pariah race would now be the Germans.  That is the pattern of occupation as established by the military regulations on  the first strip of territory in Germany occupied by the Allies.</p>
	  
      <p>
        The bourgeoisie have noted with dread the experience of Fascism in  Europe, but are unable to profit thereby. Hitler&rsquo;s rule, as that of Mussolini,  depended on a number of factors, all of which have disappeared today. No regime  can last without mass backing. This backing was given in the first period of  the rule of fascism by the deluded middle class. Once they had become disillusioned  it was only the inertia, apathy, and disappointment of the masses in the  failure and incapacity of their own organisations, which prevented the  dictators&rsquo; overthrow. With the masses aroused by the events of the war,  Mussolini was doomed, as is Hitler. Hitler endeavoured, by military force, to  replace the shattered ranks of Mussolini&rsquo;s militia. He has found in North Italy  that once overthrown, it was impossible to reinstate the fascists, though they  tried hard enough. A totalitarian oppression is bad enough. <em>A foreign totalitarian repression is  unbearable!</em></p>
	  
      <p>
        But the Allied capitalist statesmen realise this only too well. They are  expecting as desperate a resistance as the Nazis received in the lands they  conquered. Hence there is a clear and cool calculation in the campaign pushed  forward in the bourgeois press of Britain and America <em>that the Nazis expecting inevitable defeat are preparing to go  &ldquo;underground&rdquo;</em>. The idea in itself does not bear examination. No more than  in the case of Mussolini, could Hitler with what little support he still  possesses, survive the military debacle.</p>
	  
      <p>
        But the thoroughly roused German masses who have had to put up with  unbearable repression, would not for long tolerate the repression of the  Allies, especially as they witness the Allied fraternization with and  protection of, the Nazi bureaucrats and capitalists. They would inevitably  resist in the most desperate fashion the Allied oppression and exploitation. In  order to kill any sympathy or support for such movements of opposition among  the workers in the Allied countries the Allied command are preparing to use  Stalin&rsquo;s technique and label every such uprising, strike, protest or  demonstration, as &ldquo;<em>underground Nazi</em>&rdquo;  or &ldquo;<em>Nazi inspired</em>&rdquo;. Hence, their  terror and fear of fraternization between the German workers and Allied armies;  hence their adoption of the same technique as Hitler (who in turn had learned  it from the repression of the Imperialists in the colonies in the occupied  territories). The destruction of the little town of Wallendorf had the same  deliberate aim as the destruction of Lidice and other towns by the  Nazis: <em>to terrorise the population and  create a gulf between them and the Allied soldiers</em>. But all such efforts in  the long run will break down, on the disgust of the Allied soldiers at being  used for such reprisals and punishments.</p>
      <h4>Prepare for the socialist revolution</h4>
      <p>Meanwhile,  in Germany itself under the claws of the Nazis a new generation of  revolutionaries is being fashioned. A generation hard and unbreakable, tested  and steeled in the fire of Nazi repression. The Allied ruling class directs its  propaganda against the German youth. With good reason! Not at all because it is  &ldquo;corrupted&rdquo; by the teachings of Nazism, but because of its striving towards  revolutionary change. Again the example of Italy indicates how easily youth,  which feels the burden of fascist repression and stifling of all initiative and  independence, more than any other section of the population, assimilates  rapidly revolutionary ideas and methods at the first opportunity. The reports  which have trickled through show the strong opposition in Germany against  Hitlerism even now among the youth. The working class and even the middle class  student youth and schoolboys have provided groups of recruits to the anti-Nazi  organisations.</p>
	  
      <p>For many reasons it is likely that the old workers&rsquo; organizations, which  so ignobly surrendered to Hitler, may not gain so firm a support even in the  early stages of the revolution in Germany as in the other countries in Europe.  Any attempt to cooperate with the Allied conquerors would immediately label  them as traitors in the eyes of the masses. The Stalinist programme of  Vansittartite repressions and reparations would speedily lose these gentry any  support they might muster in Germany. From the ranks of the German workers will  come some of the finest fighters for the Socialist revolution. In Germany what  groups of Socialists, Communists and worker-oppositionists existed and  developed have been compelled to weigh up the situation and give a lead  independently of the bureaucrats of Stalinism and the Social Democrats, by the  very conditions of the unparalleled Nazi terror. In the factories the best  militants have learned to appraise the situation carefully and thoroughly. Upon  these revolutionary fighters, it will not be so easy to impose the policy of  class collaboration. The thoughts of the German workers are bitter and they  have been coloured by the excesses of the Nazis. Every worker must have cast  longing glances at the lamp-posts when faced with some particularly irksome  tyranny on the part of the Nazis or his bosses&mdash;he does not make much  distinction between his employer or factory &ldquo;f&uuml;hrer&rdquo; and the Nazi regime.</p>
	  
      <p>
        But the fate of Germany obviously cannot be  separated from the fate of Europe. The millions of foreign slaves that Hitler  imported into Germany will play an important role in this respect. They have  established secret and friendly relations with the German workers despite the  strict Nazi prohibition against this. They will take back memories of the  German workers' opposition to the regime and their fraternal class solidarity  when they return to the countries from whence they came. The problem of the  German revolution cannot be separated from the problem of the revolution in all  Europe. The war has tied the fate of all the European countries together.  Events in one will have immediate repercussions in all the others.</p>
	  
      <p>
        In this connection the events in Bulgaria when the Red Army marched in,  mirror in miniature the possibilities lodged in the situation in the whole of  Europe. Despite all, when the Red Army marched into Sofia the <em>class</em> not the <em>national</em> or <em>racial</em> instincts immediately exerted their supremacy. According to the report  published in the <em>News Chronicle</em> (significantly the only paper which carried the news in Britain and even more  significantly only in the <em>early</em> editions, as it was suppressed in the later issues) <em>the Red Army soldiers were fraternising with the civilian population,  with the Bulgarian Army and with the German soldiers!</em> One ecstatic mass  exchanging the Red Front salute!</p>
	  
      <p>
        As the British correspondent who witnessed these events ingeniously  remarked, <em>the Communist Party could have  taken power without any possibility of opposition but did not seem to want to  do so!</em> What an historical crime has been committed by the perfidious role  of Stalinism!</p>
	  
      <p>
        However, the task is not to meditate on the role  of Stalinism and reformism but to prepare actively to combat them. The military  battles in Europe are drawing to a close&mdash;the era of class battle will replace  it.<br />
        If the Revolutionary Communists of Germany  together with the Fourth International everywhere, can succeed in finding their  way to the masses and building strong revolutionary parties, it is they who  will determine the future&mdash;that of the Socialist United States of Europe.</p>
