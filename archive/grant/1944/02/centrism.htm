<h4>Ridley and Brockway Exponents of Confusion</h4>

<p class="fst">The question of the International is the key question of our epoch. In it is 
involved the fate not only of the I.L.P. but of the working class throughout the 
world for many decades to come. That is why it is of decisive importance for 
revolutionaries to have complete clarity as to what we mean by rebuilding the 
International.</p>

<p>From this point of view the contributions of Ridley and Brockway to the 
Internal Bulletin reveal a deplorable lack of understanding of the problem. 
Ridley's contribution, which is so enthusiastically praised by Brockway, does 
not once really get down to the basis of the problem. He starts off on the wrong 
foot immediately by introducing entirely irrelevant and erroneous conceptions on 
the &quot;internationalism&quot; of the Mohammedans and of the bourgeois revolution. As a self styled Marxist Ridley should know better than that. Internationalism is 
not an idea which has its application at any period in history. The material 
basis has to be prepared if the idea of internationalism is to assume any 
reality whatsoever. That was precisely the historic role of capitalism: the 
development of the entire globe into a single economic inter-dependent whole 
through the creation of a world market, to which every country's and even every 
continent's economy is indissolubly linked and bound. This is the material basis 
which links the interests of the workers of all lands and on which Marx built 
his conception of internationalism. The slogan: <em>Workers of the World unite!</em> was not put forward from a sentimental point of view - which was completely 
foreign to Marx - but as a scientific expression of the interests of the 
working class; an expression of the interests of the development of world 
economy. To talk about the possibilities of internationalism before the 
development of capitalism as a world economy has laid the basis for it, is to 
deal with the question from a vulgar utopian point of view, and to reject the 
very elementary basis of Marxism.</p>

<p>That this lapse is not an accidental one, is shown by Ridley's treatment of 
the problems of the rise and decline of the first three internationals and his 
light-minded attitude towards the problem of the Fourth International.</p>

<p>Even accepting the explanation given by Ridley that the conditions of 
imperialism led to the decline and degeneration of the Second and Third 
Internationals, not to speak of the first, what follows from this? To argue the 
inevitability of this decline from the objective conditions of capitalism alone, 
is to reason not as a Marxist but as a fatalist. Precisely on this question, 
more than any other, the &quot;dialectical&quot; approach  Ridley uses this expression 
while employing a crassly empirical method  is necessary. This can be seen by 
Ridley's references to the Bolshevik Party. He writes:</p>

<p>&quot;The revolutionary character which Bolshevism alone among the parties of the 
Second International, still retained, was due primarily to the still 
feudal-absolutist nature of the Russian state, which made reformism 
impossible.&quot;</p>

<p>As an explanation of the development of the Bolshevik Party and of its 
success, this falls rather short of the mark, to say the least. The &quot;feudal 
absolutist nature of the Russian State&quot; did not prevent the development of 
Menshevism which played the dominating role in the early stages of the Russian 
revolution. Nor did it prevent Zinoviev, Kamenev and Stalin from taking up a 
fundamentally false attitude during the course of the revolution; an attitude 
and policy which, if carried out, would have made the victory of the Russian 
revolution impossible. Had their fatal course been followed and the revolution 
been irretrievably wrecked, no doubt Ridley, with his erudite historical method, 
would have announced with his air of great profundity &quot;Russia is a backward 
feudal country entirely unripe for socialism (which incidentally was the 
argument of the Mensheviks at the time). Given the immaturity of the 
proletariat and of social relations, the seizure of power by the workers was a 
fantastic dream.&quot;</p>

<p>This false conception of the development of world history is shown in the 
reason he gives for the failure of the Third International  which was conceived 
on Ridley's admission on the basis of a complete break with reformism and its 
policies.</p>

<p>&quot;These can be reduced to two: the failure of International revolution in the 
first phase  1919-26, and the subsequent impossibility of 'combining' an active 
policy of world revolution with the economic needs of the backward Russian 
State. We may add that the first of these two causes had itself a double root 
in: the corruption of the Western workers by imperialism  (cp. section on 
International)  and in the organisation of the Comintern, which, arising 
on the still mediaeval soil of Russia, adopted inevitably pre-democratic, 
pre-capitalist forms of organisation which unfitted it for victory in the more 
advanced Western world, which had already traversed its bourgeois democratic 
revolution. To lead an anti-capitalist revolution from a pre-capitalist soil was 
to lead history from behind. Sooner or later, the world revolution had to be 
sacrificed to the needs of Russia or vice-versa. <em>This was the basis of the 
Trotsky versus Stalin controversy</em></p>

<p>Ridley's reasons for the collapse of the International explain precisely 
nothing, in fact they reveal that Ridley has not the slightest understanding of 
the basic lessons of our epoch. In the first place why was it impossible to 
combine &quot;an active policy of world revolution with the economic needs of the 
backward Russian state&quot;? Far from being in conflict (this is a conception that, 
like much else, Ridley has borrowed from the Stalinists whom he professes to 
despise, and indeed, if correct could serve as a justification of the policies 
of the Russian Stalinists) the two were and, even today, are indissolubly bound 
together. It is not an accident that the idea of Five Year Plans was developed 
by the internationalists and opposed in the initial stages by Stalin. It is not 
the economic interests of Russia which are in conflict with the international 
revolution, <em>but the interests of the Stalinist bureaucracy</em>; and 
incidentally the latter are contradictory to the &quot;economic needs&quot; of the Soviet 
state as well.</p>

<p>This one point in itself is an example of Ridley's anti-Marxian and shallow 
method of analysis. The explanation for the failure of the international 
revolution is about on the same level. The &quot;corruption&quot; of the Western workers 
did not prevent them in the period 1919-26 from advancing on the road of 
revolution. The German revolution, Austrian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, etc.; the 
seizure of the factories by the Italian workers; the revolutionary 
possibilities in France and Britain during 1918-20; the revolutionary situation 
in Germany in 1923; the general strike in Britain in 1926  Ridley is completely 
blind to these. His petty bourgeois arrogance can only see corruption of the 
workers. In fact, no other period in history has witnessed so many heroic and 
selfless attempts on the part of the masses in the West to overthrow capitalism, 
to deal with Europe alone. Heroic efforts which were continued with the 
movements of the Belgian, Austrian, Spanish and French workers in the last 
decade. No more could possibly be asked of the workers than their 
insurrectionary replies to the crimes of imperialism since the last world war.</p>

<p>It is precisely on the basis of the lessons of these unsuccessful attempts, 
that the new international must be built. To these, the sectarian-centrist 
Ridley is completely blind, as his second reason discloses: &quot;Sooner or later the 
world revolution had to be sacrificed to the needs of Russia, or vice-versa.&quot; 
Why? However, there is no need to dwell on this point. But Ridley makes an 
assertion with regard to &quot;organisation&quot; of which he does not bother to give the 
slightest proof. <em>In fact precisely the opposite is the case.</em> The history 
of the last few decades is marked by many revolutions. Only one was victorious. 
Because of the absolutist-feudal regime which produced an absolutist-feudal 
organisation to combat it ?  that is what Ridley is attempting to imply. Utter 
rubbish! The Russian Revolution was victorious because not only all the other 
conditions for revolution were present  they have been present many times in 
other countries of the East and West, not only the objective conditions were 
present, but the <em>subjective</em> as well: <em>the existence of a Bolshevik 
Party and a Bolshevik leadership with Bolshevik organisational method  with a 
correct policy based on revolutionary Marxism.</p>

</em>
<p>The great contribution of Lenin to Marxism was not only in theory but 
precisely on the question of organisation. The immaturity of the revolutionary 
vanguard and the mistakes which flowed from this was the cause of the failure of 
the Communist International in the early years; the absence precisely of 
Bolshevik Parties and Bolshevik methods of organisation ensured the doom of 
the revolutions after the war.</p>

<p>In Germany one of the reasons, if not the main reason for the failure of the 
Spartacists under Rosa Luxemburg to lead the German revolution to success was 
the fact that the German revolutionary left was not organised as a Bolshevik 
Party and with Bolshevik methods. Or perhaps Ridley, with his social 
revolutionary fatalism would argue that Luxemburg and the German revolutionaries 
were also corrupted by German imperialism?</p>

<p>Ridley asserts that the methods of the Bolsheviks pertained to 
&quot;pre-capitalist&quot; Russia: that is, they were good enough for barbarian and 
backward Russians but certainly not for cultured &quot;intellectuals&quot; of the Ridley 
stamp. Far from the method of organisation stemming from Russia's past, it was 
created by Lenin, as was Bolshevism itself, on the importation of Marxism, i.e. 
&quot;German  English  French&quot; socialism into Russia. However, exactly the opposite 
conclusions would flow from Ridley's argument if he had thought out the question 
clearly. According to his method of analysis the development of the Labour 
movement in the West was conditioned by the &quot;corruption&quot; of the workers, 
whereas the Russian absolutism produces Bolshevism. Consequently, the so-called 
&quot;democratic&quot; methods of organisation of the Socialist movement in the West are 
an expression of the corruption of the working class, according to this logic. 
To put the problem thus is to demonstrate its absurdity. If the argument on 
organisational structure has any validity at all, it can only be that Bolshevik 
organisation has stood the test of history; all other methods have brought the 
proletariat to catastrophe.</p>

<p>If Ridley, and also the I.L.P. N.A.C., which has apparently endorsed 
Ridley's ideas in the main, can criticise in detail the alleged mistakes in the 
organisational structure of the Bolshevik Party, an eager and expectant public 
has yet to see these committed to paper. If they have a brand new and 
infallible set of organisational rules which can guarantee success, it would 
certainly be of interest and enlightenment to study them. Till then Marxists 
will stick to the organisational method and principle of Bolshevism  a method 
which guarantees a greater measure of proletarian democracy through the method 
of democratic centralism than any other yet developed.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the conclusion  which has now penetrated even into the 
skulls of the N.A.C. centrists (at least in their formal statements) that the 
Second and Third Internationals have collapsed, Ridley proceeds to examine the 
problem of the Fourth.</p>

<p>&quot;Trotsky was undoubtedly a revolutionary genius, but was too egotistic for a 
successful practical politician&quot;</p>

<p>Coming from Ridley, such a trite and frivolous remark could he ignored, 
except that it demonstrates the real narrowness of outlook which makes him 
attempt to ascribe his own limited outlook to those he criticises. Probably 
Ridley is still smarting at the memory of the just criticism levelled against 
him by Comrade Trotsky when he advocated in 1931 the idea of immediately 
proclaiming the Fourth International! Perhaps Ridley or Brockway or Maxton 
possess the qualities that make a successful &quot;practical&quot; politician? What makes 
a man a practical politician is, as usual, not explained. Perhaps Stalin 
defeated Trotsky and the Left Opposition because he was not &quot;egotistic&quot; and was 
a &quot;successful practical politician&quot; In fact Stalin's personal success <em>was</em> 
due to his personal &quot;egotistic&quot; qualities and his &quot;practical politics&quot;, but 
hardly served the interests of socialism. But the very raising of this question 
in the casual manner it is introduced, serves as an indictment of the 
impressionistic ideas of Ridley. When Trotsky led the October insurrection and 
organised the Red Armies, his &quot;egotistic&quot; qualities apparently prevented him 
from being a &quot;successful&quot; practical politician! What an explanation of events! 
This is followed up by what is intended as a contemptuous dismissal of the 
theoretical basis of the Fourth International:</p>

<p>&quot;its (Fourth International's) ideology is little more than a continuation of 
the revolutionary phase of the Comintern.&quot;</p>

<p>He could have said that it was the continuation of the ideology dating back 
to Marx. What is intended as a sneer, in fact is a testimony to the continuity 
of revolutionary tradition which is embodied in the Fourth International.</p>

<p>Thus Ridley blindly dismisses the lessons of the last period in shallow 
personal criticisms, which in any case are false through and through. To expect 
from Ridley a criticism of or an answer to Trotsky's theories, methods and 
contributions to Marxism, would of course be naive. In this domain, like all 
centrists he would he lost. Thus, after dismissing the egotistic and 
impractical Trotsky, he concludes his analysis of the development of the 
International founded by Trotsky:</p>

<p>&quot;In my opinion, any chance of its becoming a mass movement was destroyed by 
the death of Trotsky, who left no successor of comparable calibre. To be sure, 
any movement which depends on the writings of a dead man, who is not there to 
interpret his meaning, must inevitably become scholastic  a worshipper of the 
dead letter  or sectarian  a permanent wrangle over the unknown meaning. 
(Bibliolatary is not confined to Churches.) The &quot;Trotskyist&quot; movement, with its 
fierce disputes and endless splits, confirms the above dictum!&quot; </p>

<p>Ridley here shows about as much political perspicacity as Stalin (with 
apologies to Stalin). Stalin too had the illusion that by murdering Trotsky he 
could settle accounts once and for all with Trotskyism. True enough, the death 
of Trotsky constituted a terribly damaging blow against the international 
working class and against the young and weak forces of the Fourth 
International. But an International is not one man. An International as Trotsky 
had occasion to point out to the I.L.P. &quot;is not at all a form as flows from 
the utterly false formulation of the I.L.P. The International is first of all a 
programme and a system of strategic tactical and organisational methods that 
flow from it.&quot; It is apparent that an International is not built by squabbles 
over petty trifles but on great principles. The basic teachings of Trotsky 
derive from those of Marx, Engels, Lenin. It is on these solid foundations that 
the groundwork of the Fourth International has been laid. He who rejects the 
policy of the Fourth International, must show how or wherein they have departed 
from these basic principles or else wherein these principles have been proved 
false by experience. Of this, not a word from Ridley or the I.L.P. but instead 
this puerile argument which is not worthy of even a schoolboy.</p>

<p>However, while talking of the &quot;New International&quot; Ridley is prudently silent 
on the instructive history of the &quot;international&quot; organisation to which the 
I.L.P. gave its adherence, the London Bureau. Brockway comments on this 
significant omission, but attempts to explain it by the suggestion that the 
&quot;Bureau&quot; never considered itself an International. Certainly the history of the 
Bureau testifies to the fact that any international grouping of &quot;socialist&quot; 
parties in modern times, which are not bound together by common principles and a 
common programme  Marxism-Leninism, will be speedily shattered by the impact 
of events. There is hardly one of the brother parties of the I.L.P. which is 
associated with the Bureau today. Under the relentless pressure of the class 
struggle they have failed to stand the test and have been driven to the four 
corners of the political compass. The remnants of the Swedish party have gone 
back to the swamp of Stalinism. The American Lovestoneites have committed 
suicide by dissolving their organisation. Despite the experience of the war, 
the Norwegian Labour Party remains the loyal servant of His Majesty, King 
Haakon. The emigre S.A.P. of Germany has leaned towards the Stalinists and 
support of the Allies in the war. The Spanish P.O.U.M., despite the catastrophe 
its policy brought about in Spain, is flirting with the idea of an emigre 
Popular Front, thus providing a caricature of the policy it operated in the 
revolution. The rest of the parties, like all centrist organisations have 
collapsed in a similar inglorious fashion. The I.L.P. as the lone survivor of 
this debacle, has itself described a very weird evolution in its policies in the 
intervening period. If it remains and can still prate of internationalism, it 
is not because it is made of sterner material and sticks rigidly to principles. 
But because it has not yet been put to the test. The P.O.U.M. at least was far 
more of a revolutionary organisation, than the I.L.P. ever could be.</p>

<p>The problem of the &quot;new&quot; international can only be understood in relation to 
the experience of the international working class over the last few decades. It 
is on this basis that the principles and ideas of the Fourth International have 
been worked out, with the method of Marxism as the basis. What have the 
&quot;theoreticians&quot; of the I.L.P. learned? In <em>Stalinism and Bolshevism</em><b>,</b> 
Trotsky makes the proud boast:</p>

<p>&quot;The Bolshevik Party was able to carry on such magnificent &quot;practical&quot; work 
only because it shed the light of theory on all its steps. Bolshevism did not 
create this theory: it was furnished by Marxism. But Marxism is the theory of 
movement and not of stagnation. Only events on a tremendous historical scale 
could enrich the theory itself. Bolshevism (Trotskyism) brought an invaluable 
contribution to Marxism in its analysis of the imperialist epoch as an epoch of 
wars and revolutions; of bourgeois democracy in the era of decaying capitalism; 
of the correlation between the general strike and the insurrection; of the role 
of party, soviets and trade unions in the epoch of proletarian revolutions; in 
its theory of the soviet state, of the economy of transition, of fascism and 
Bonapartism in the epoch of capitalist decline; finally in its analysis of the 
degeneration of the Bolshevik party itself and of the soviet state. Let any 
other tendency be named that has added anything essential to the conclusions and 
generalisations of Bolshevism.&quot;</p>

<p>In rejecting the programme of the Fourth International naturally enough, 
neither Ridley, Brockway or any other leader of the I.L.P. faces up to a 
criticism of these theoretical achievements. Ridley's thesis, if such it can be 
called, is composed of bits and pieces taken from the programmes and theories of 
a number of fundamentally opposed currents in the working class movement. Ideas 
lifted direct from the S.P.G.B. on the colonial question, from the anarchists 
on the State, from the Stalinists on Russia, a distorted idea here and there 
from the Trotskyists, and laid over with the confused conceptions of the 
Centrists withal! And he tries to palm off this horrible mess as Marxism with 
the benediction of Fenner Brockway and the N.A.C. of the I.L.P. It would require 
a volume to deal with the theoretical blunders and misconceptions which bristle 
in nearly every paragraph. Take this typical specimen of muddled thinking:</p>

<p>&quot;Viewed from this angle, it is obvious that no fully socialist society, in 
the sense indicated above, could possible have emerged from the activities of 
the earlier Internationals to which allusion was made in the preceding section. 
In the time of the First International only a small part of Europe and America 
was either capitalist or democratic. (Outside Europe and America both Capitalism 
and Democracy were unknown). In the time of the Second International, 
Imperialism and world capitalism had not yet exhausted their role; neither had 
yet &quot;left off&quot;. Whilst both the Third and Fourth Internationals were based, in 
effect, upon the social conditions of a pre-capitalist-feudal-autocratic 
Russian society.</p>

<p>Thus, none of the aforementioned socialist Internationals could have led to 
world socialism in the sense which Marxism exclusively attached to that 
conception. Their failure was, under the given conditions, inevitable. e.g. Had 
they succeeded, their victory would have been progressive but not socialist. At 
the most, they could only have led to regimes of state-capitalism.&quot;</p>

<p>What does this nonsense mean? That, had the Third or Fourth Internationals 
succeeded in conquering power in any of the major European countries they would 
have gone the way of Russia? But not, even Ridley, far less the I.L.P. has in 
the past disputed, or even now disputes, that even the degenerate Soviet State 
remains today a <em>workers' state</em>, not a &quot;state capitalist regime.&quot; Or is 
Ridley perhaps stealthily hinting that Russia has gone state capitalist? He 
certainly should have informed the world of this in a less casual way. But even 
when one admits the reactionary military-police superstructure which Stalinism 
has infamously imposed upon the Soviet Union, what does this prove in relation 
to the problem of a Soviet Germany? The measures of repression taken by the 
Bolsheviks were not a question of principle but imposed upon them by the 
hostile imperialist environment and the backwardness of Russia. A victory for a 
Socialist Germany after the last war, which was entirely possible, would have 
altered the whole relationship of forces throughout the world. Backward Russia 
in this war and in the years before it, has provided a wonderful example of the 
powers of socialist methods of production. A combination of the economy of 
mighty Germany and the resources of Russia would have been invincible both 
economically and militarily. It could but have been the prelude to the victory 
of the revolution in Europe and throughout the world. Such a victory would have 
led not to &quot;state capitalism&quot; but to the abolition of the state within a 
generation or so throughout the globe. It is painful to have to repeat such 
elementary Marxian propositions to those proposing to lay down &quot;new&quot; and 
infallible prescriptions for a new International.</p>

<p>Ridley's explanation of the failure of the Internationals is certainly 
ingenious enough. They failed therefore the time was not ripe for them! A 
wonderful scientific reading of history, which he improves upon by telling us 
that even if they succeeded they would still have failed. But this does not as 
yet provide us with an <em>analysis</em> of the reasons for the defeats any more 
than the man who explained heat by saying that it was hot!</p>

<p>As if to reduce his views to absurdity, Ridley goes on:</p>

<p>&quot;The next International mounts on the shoulders of History. It can actually 
do what the others promised. It arises in a continent (Europe) now unified by 
History  using Hitler as its blind instrument!  and in rapid process of 
industrial development. Led by a socialist Germany, a socialist France, and a 
socialist England, the United Socialist States of Europe will for the first time 
in all history, fulfil the Marxist prerequisite for a genuine scientific 
socialist society.&quot;</p>

<p>As usual, everything is stood on its head. The job the Internationals failed 
to carry out is supposed to have been achieved by Hitler. As Trotsky would say 
Ridley confuses the brake with the locomotive of history, revolution with 
counter-revolution. In fact the position is precisely the opposite. Hitler's 
coming to power, the war, Hitler's victories in Europe are the result of the <em>
failure</em> of the working class to carry out the tasks urgently posed by 
history, the failure of the working class (i.e. of its organisations) to abolish 
the contradiction between the development of the productive forces beyond 
nations boundaries' and the national state by progressive means, has led to an 
attempt at solution by reactionary means.</p>

<p>The formalistic, anti-Marxist out look of Ridley and the I.L.P. is expressed 
in the &quot;three main purposes&quot; of Ridley's projected &quot;fifth (in reality 2 ) 
International:</p>

<p>&quot;As it aims at the creation of a socialist society which <em>starts</em> on the 
basis of a <em>finished</em> capitalism</p>

<p>it should confine itself to those parts of the world  primarily Europe, 
later, perhaps, the Americas  where the objective social conditions exist (e.g. 
In Asia and Africa the only kind of revolution possible is a predominantly 
agrarian anti-feudal revolution of the Russian type, which can, at best, only 
end in State capitalism and dictatorship, since the objective conditions for 
scientific socialism  viz. the abolition of economic scarcity and political 
democracy  do not exist. The European world has so long a start that, for the 
20th century, a socialist Europe, no longer torn by civil war, must continue to 
lead the world).&quot;</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find in any revolutionary writings a paragraph which 
exposed such complete bankruptcy in the conception of world history and the 
method of historical materialism. Ridley once wittily referred to the S.P.G.B. 
as a Victorian survival. It would be hard for even this sect to produce a 
statement such as this, from whom of course it is derived. Brockway for 
sentimental reasons comes nearer the correct policy than the &quot;Marxist&quot; Ridley, 
when he rejects this section of the document relating to the colonial question. 
It is almost a century since Marx pointed out the interdependent character of 
world economy which it was capitalism's historic task to develop. Since that 
time, particularly in the last few decades with the development of imperialism, 
and the emergence of new techniques, this position has been emphasised. Even 
Churchill, Roosevelt, Hitler and other bourgeois politicians understand this 
better than Ridley. The world has become a single economic unit and because of 
this, events in one continent immediately have political and economic 
repercussions in every other. Incredible that Ridley has not seen the social 
implications of the global war to which he so often refers. The sheer 
Victorian-European (&quot;white&quot;) arrogance with which Ridley divides those 
privileged advanced countries ready for Socialism, which his International will 
condescend to honour with a section from those benighted countries to be cast 
into the nether darkness till they are economically ready to have its attention 
is only matched by his ignorance of the world historical process in the past 
decades. Even the reformist Second International did not go so far as this. 
While in reality confined to Europe it paid lip service to the struggle for 
liberation of the colonial peoples and for the work in the colonies. Ridley is 
afraid that revolutions in colonies will end in state capitalism and 
dictatorship on the lines of the Revolution in Russia. Even granting that this 
is so, would not this be a tremendous step forward in comparison with the 
slavery of the colonial peoples today? Ridley, the historical &quot;authority&quot; is 
apparently against &quot;bourgeois&quot; revolutions in the East today, though willing 
enough to accept completed revolutions from the past. We would remind him that 
neither the French nor British revolutions were achieved &quot;democratically&quot; or 
through &quot;libertarian&quot; means but through bourgeois dictatorship. In any event, 
by implication Ridley is condemning the Russian Revolution without stating this 
openly. He wishes to throw out the Soviet revolutionary baby with the dirty 
Stalinist bathwater. But far from being a reactionary event, the Russian 
revolution remains the greatest event in human history. And what alternative 
was there for Russia? A failure on the part of the Bolsheviks to seize power 
would have led to economic stagnation and the colonisation of Russia by the 
other great powers. Ridley overlooks one of the great progressive achievements 
of the Third International and its founders. It would appear that he has not 
read or understood the writings of either Lenin or Trotsky. While the problem of 
the revolution in the colonies was not developed by Marx (though in advance he 
riddled the Ridleyian conception by showing that a successful revolution. in 
China would automatically lead to a revolution in the developed countries of 
the West) it received detailed attention and study from those revolutionary 
theorists who worked out its basic laws. On this never a word from the light 
minded Ridley. Even if we accept as correct, which broadly speaking is true, 
that revolution in Europe is coming in the next period, the fate of such 
revolutions will at least be partly determined by the explosions it will 
produce in Asia, Africa and other colonial and semi-colonial countries. One of 
the expressions of capitalism's historic impasse is that social disturbances 
and revolutions in any part of the globe immediately react on the other 
continents as well; there is not one continent or country in which explosive 
material has not been accumulated. Lenin, in his analysis of imperialism showed 
that the road to revolution in the West lay in destroying the source of the 
super-profits for capitalism in the East, the means whereby &quot;corruption&quot; of the 
Western workers was maintained. Ridley talks about &quot;corruption&quot; of workers in 
the West but is apparently against destroying the basis of this.</p>

<p>However, Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution shows Ridley to be a crude 
scholastic of the worst type. (If Ridley had studied the works of &quot;dead&quot; 
revolutionaries, he would not derive his ideas from men who have been 
politically dead for years). Trotsky shows that the process of social evolution 
is not at all a mechanical and rigid one. Because of the intervention of 
imperialism in the colonial areas, the development of these countries proceeds 
on different lines to the history of Britain, France and the other advanced 
states. The imperialists attempt to maintain the old feudal relations and 
prevent a &quot;normal&quot; development along capitalist lines. The capitalists of 
backward countries, because of the belatedness of their development are 
inextricably entangled with the landlords, the semi-feudal regime and with the 
imperialists. Any movement of the masses which threatened the imperialists or 
the landlords would almost automatically assume anti-capitalist tendencies at 
the next stage, besides which the capitalists are economically integrated with 
the landlords and would be hard hit by any incursions on their property. Thus 
the bourgeoisie in backward and colonial countries is incapable of carrying 
through the bourgeois revolution. It is this development of world history which 
made the October Revolution in Russia possible. The fact that the bourgeoisie, 
having ceased to play a progressive role, the bourgeois-democratic revolution 
can only be carried out by a conquest of power by the proletariat. The tens and 
hundreds of millions of the peasantry, history has demonstrated conclusively, 
are incapable of playing an independent role. They can only support and follow 
the lead of some other class in the cities to achieve their aims. As the 
bourgeoisie cannot fulfil the revolutionary role they did in the past, the 
leadership of the peasantry now falls to the young and vigorous proletariat. 
But having attained power, the proletariat cannot stop at the democratic tasks, 
including the breaking up of the large estates and the division of the land 
among the peasantry, but will inevitably turn towards socialist measures, 
expropriation of the capitalists, etc. But this in its turn, will come up 
against the weak and backward character of the economy. The sole solution lies 
in the extension of the revolution to the more advanced countries. Hence the 
naming of the process the Permanent Revolution.</p>

<p>Trotsky was writing on this in 1903. The October Revolution and events in 
Spain, India and China have completely confirmed the correctness of this 
theory. But all that the cowardly Centrist can see is that the state that issued 
from the Russian Revolution has degenerated. To draw the conclusion: not to 
extend the revolution and thus end the isolation  but to send the colonial 
masses  that is the greater part of humanity  to perdition . . . till they are 
economically ready for socialism. A position which the development of world 
imperialism has rendered impossible in any event. But as the revolutions in the 
West are at least partially dependent for success or failure on the movement of 
the masses in the East, this is tantamount to declaring Socialism impossible of 
realisation anywhere. Not for nothing did Lenin say that the road to the 
revolution in Britain lay through Delhi. The doctrine that the revolution must 
inevitably come in Europe first is not only false, but pedantic and utterly 
devoid of any dialectical content. Nowhere is it written that the proletariat of 
Germany must come to power before the proletariat of China, or the proletariat 
of Britain before that of India. True it is that a revolution in the East, 
though it would immediately purge society of the feudal rubbish accumulated over 
centuries, and if only for that reason would he completely justified, could 
nevertheless not stand on its own resources for a long period of time. But it 
would provide an enormous impetus to the revolution in Europe and America, to 
whose proletariat the Eastern peoples would look for assistance and succour. 
The revolution is as indivisible and inter-connected as the war itself. 
Revolution in Europe means revolution in Asia  and the Americas  and also 
vice-versa.</p>

<p>In an attempt to cover his false position, Ridley goes on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;Hence, whilst encouraging and supporting all non-European progressive 
revolutions, we do not identify our <em>socialist</em> revolution with progressive 
non-socialist ones, as has been done so disastrously in the era of the Russian 
Revolution which ended with the dissolution of the Comintern and the 
assassination of Trotsky. The new International drops the vague and too 
ambiguous title  ''World Revolution&quot;  and concentrates on the &quot;United 
States of Europe. It is, actually, a distinction without a difference, for who 
wins Europe today wins the world tomorrow!</p>

<p>The above analysis should have disposed of this artificial conception, which 
attempts to separate the fate of Europe from that of the rest of the world and 
contains a sharp &quot;distinction&quot; and a sharp &quot;difference&quot; with Marxism on the 
problem of the colonial areas.</p>

<p>Having disdained to examine the programme and principles of the Fourth 
International, which represents the application of Marxism to the modern epoch, 
Ridley and the I.L.P. proceed to adopt ideas  in the name of &quot;Marxism'' at that 
 which date back not to the pre-Bolshevik epoch, but are even pre-Marxian. Says 
Ridley, and in this he has the warm support of Brockway and the N.A.C.:</p>

<p>&quot;Our slogans must be suited to this so changed atmosphere (hatred of 
totalitarian stateism and of war). As dialectics, Marxism has no use for 
outmoded thought-forms and outdated slogans. For example, to make a revolution 
against (bourgeois) dictatorship 'in the name of &quot;The Dictatorship of the 
Proletariat&quot; would be worse than futile. Contrarily, it is necessary to borrow 
heavily from Anarchism and Syndicalism emphasising the slogans of &quot;workers' 
control&quot; against bureaucracy, personal liberty against state regimentation, 
socialist ethics against the cynical amoralism of Fascist and Stalinist 
gangsters. Full anarchism (or anarchist-communism) is, indeed, impossible 
whilst the State remains, but each form of society leans towards its successor, 
and socialism can immediately where once its scientific prerequisites already 
exist, begin, already, to lean towards its eventual anarchist-communist 
successor.&quot;</p>

<p>What this mass of confused and contradictory ideas means, not Ridley himself 
could explain. If he means that the State will be only a transitional one till 
socialism is realised, (what is this nonsense about Anarchist-communist 
successors?) that would merely be the orthodox-Marxist way of regarding the 
problem. If he believes that 'Socialism 'could immediately be introduced even in 
Europe or the United States, that is not economically possible. The State will 
continue to exist in the period after the seizure of power and only gradually 
&quot;wither away&quot; into Socialism. Ridley confusedly agrees that the State will 
remain in the first period after power has been achieved by the workers. But to 
repeat the A.B.C. of Marxian ideas which Ridley does not seem to understand, <em>
the State is an instrument of oppression of one class over another</em>, it is 
the guardian of inequality and its existence presupposes that the economic basis 
for the complete abolition of classes has not yet been achieved. Under 
capitalism, the state is the instrument of the capitalist class and is used for 
the suppression of the workers. When the workers take power they must smash the 
bourgeois state and replace it with one of their own, based on the workers' 
Soviets. And such a State cannot but be a &quot;dictatorship&quot;. Ridley cannot have it 
both ways. Either he supports the idea of a state which must mean some form of 
coercion (i.e. dictatorship) or rejects it completely and thus must embrace 
anarchist doctrine. In this case he should come out openly against Marxism. For 
the question of the nature of the state before and after the conquest of power 
is one of the decisive criterions which separates Marxism from all other 
tendencies in the Labour movement. Just as bourgeois democracy cannot be 
anything else but the dictatorship of the capitalist class so such a state can 
only be the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat.&quot; If Ridley means that we
should reject the Stalinist caricature, that has long been a tenet of 
Bolshevism. But the Bolsheviks put in its place the idea of &quot;workers' democracy&quot; 
 a democracy of the toilers as opposed to the democracy of the rich  as it was 
in the early days of the Soviet Union. There is no need to borrow half-baked 
anarchist ideas. Revolutionaries, if they are to be successful, must stick to 
the scientific method of Marxism. And whatever its form, which may vary from one 
country to another, the rule of the workers cannot be anything else but the 
dictatorship of the proletariat. With the victory of the workers in Europe 
such a dictatorship would he very light, guaranteeing full freedom of speech, 
press, etc., even possibly to the bourgeois parties, certainly to all parties 
accepting the Soviet system, as a return to capitalism would be almost out of 
the question. But this is purely a question of expediency, not of principle. The 
much slandered Bolsheviks on whom Ridley by implication, pours his quota of 
slime, did not at all begin with ruthless measures. Even the liberal press was 
not suppressed. Only when the existence of the Soviet State was menaced by 
internal counter-revolution and world-wide capitalist intervention, did the 
Bolsheviks reply with the Red Terror to the terror of the White Guards. We stand 
unreservedly with the Bolsheviks against the mawkish sentimentality of Ridley 
and Co. The Bolsheviks have provided the world working class with an example to 
be followed in the coming revolutions if they are not to go under in a new wave 
of capitalist barbarism. The history of Europe since the last war is a warning 
of what happens to the working class if they stop half-way on the revolutionary 
road and do not take the necessary precautions and even reprisals against the 
capitalists and their henchmen. Hitler, Mussolini and Franco have shed rivers 
of workers' blood and left the flower of the working class to rot in jails and 
concentration camps-throughout Europe. Against capitalist barbarism and with the 
future of civilisation itself at stake the working class will not stop, short of 
the most ruthless steps <em>if necessary</em> to preserve their rule by workers' 
dictatorship.</p>

<p>To tie their hands in advance could only be the advice of a Centrist. There 
is no need to borrow from the Anarchists on the other points mentioned by Ridley 
either, they are all comprised in the philosophy of Marxism and can be found in 
the works of the &quot;dead&quot; Lenin and Trotsky.</p>

<p>Trotsky writing with infallible Marxian instinct had picked on this question 
long in advance in criticising the theoretical conceptions of centrism. He 
realised that the centrists had queasy stomachs easily upset by the slightest 
difficulties and would inevitably conclude from the Stalinist experience, not 
the correct lessons, but the abandonment of the idea of a firm holding of power 
by the proletariat.. Without the Bolshevik conception of the dictatorship of 
the proletariat history has shown that it is impossible for the proletariat to 
seize power. Ridley pretends to be scared only of the term; in reality he has 
scuttled away from the problem instead of facing it and in so doing placed 
himself in the camp of Liberal-anarchism which bases itself on the rarefied air 
of &quot;Libertarianism&quot; without reference to sordid material questions such as 
time, place and conditions under which the struggle for power is waged.</p>

<p>In his book <em>Whither France</em>, Trotsky, in criticising the &quot;Left&quot; member 
of the French Socialist Party, Zyromski who- wished to &quot;apologise&quot; for being in 
favour of a &quot;dictatorship&quot; of the proletariat (Ridley unashamedly and with 
relief gives up the idea altogether without any apologies to Marxism whatsoever) 
wrote the following lines which constitute a complete refutation of Ridley's 
position:</p>

<p>&quot;For some reason or other Zyromski, in a whole series of articles, repeats 
with especial insistence the idea (moreover pointing to Stalin as original 
source) that 'the dictatorship of the proletariat can never be considered as an 
end in itself.' As if there were somewhere in the world insane theoreticians 
who thought that the dictatorship of the proletariat was an 'end in itself'! 
But in these odd repetitions there lurks an idea: Zyromski is making his 
excuses to the workers in advance for wanting a dictatorship. Unfortunately, it 
is difficult to establish the dictatorship if we begin by apologising for it.</p>

<p>Much worse, however, is the following idea: 'This dictatorship of the 
proletariat must be relaxed and progressively transformed into workers' 
democracy in proportion to the extent of the development of socialist 
construction.' In these few lines there are two profound errors in principle. 
The dictatorship of the proletariat <em>is opposed</em> to workers' democracy. However, 
the dictatorship of the proletariat by its very essence can and should be the 
supreme expression of workers' democracy. In order to bring about a great social 
revolution, there must be for the proletariat a supreme manifestation of all 
its forces and all its capacities: The proletariat is organised democratically 
precisely in order to put an end to its enemies. The dictatorship, according to 
Lenin, should 'teach every cook to direct the State.' The heavy hand of the 
dictatorship is directed against the class enemies: the foundation of the 
dictatorship is constituted by the workers' democracy.</p>

<p>According to Zyromski, workers' democracy will replace the dictatorship 'in 
proportion to the extent of the development of socialist construction.' This is 
an absolutely false perspective. In proportion to the extent that bourgeois 
society is transformed into a socialist society, the workers' democracy will 
dispense with the dictatorship, for the state itself will wither away. In a 
socialist society, there will be no working class; and secondly because there 
will be no need for State repression. This is why the development of socialist 
society must mean not the transformation of the dictatorship into a democracy, 
but their common dissolution into the economic and cultural organisation of the 
socialist society.&quot;</p>

<p>This quotation annihilates Ridley's utopian socialist conceptions. It answers 
not only the nonsense of Ridley on the question of workers' power but also the 
absurd idea that even in Europe Socialism could be immediately introduced. If 
this were so then indeed the anarchists would be correct and the necessity for 
the State would disappear immediately after capitalism was overthrown. Ridley 
accepts the anarchist criticism of the dictatorship of the proletariat yet 
wishes to introduce Socialism immediately and have a state in the transition 
period  not to Socialism then  but to Anarchism into the bargain! What 
lucidity! What historical understanding! What social analysis! Ridley has no 
need to consult the works of Trotsky to get the unknown meaning, the meaning of 
Marxism is entirely unknown to Ridley.</p>

<p>Ridley sums up his erroneous conceptions:</p>

<p>&quot;Any new International must, to pull its weight in the present world, 
politically be (a) <em>anti-capitalist </em>and not merely <em>anti-feudal</em>, 
like its historic predecessors; (b) economically post- capitalist, based on the 
already solved problem of production (by capitalism) and aiming in its social 
and economic philosophy at the solution of the <em>socialist</em> problem of <em>
consumption</em> rather than the already achieved capitalist problem of <em>
production</em>; and (c) in opposition to all dictatorship must be libertarian, 
ethical and democratic.&quot;</p>

<p> It cannot be repeated too often that Socialism in our Time&quot;, in <em>this</em> 
generation, is only possible in the post-capitalist, post-democratic soil 
already cultivated by Western (bourgeois) civilisation; and it is to the 
conquest of this that a new International must direct its primary energies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It cannot be repeated too often&quot; that Ridley commits elementary errors that 
any green student of Marxist theory would not perpetrate. The three previous 
workers' Internationals were built on the basis of anti-capitalism. But to say 
that the new International must not be anti-feudalist is so much fantasy. In the 
greater part of the world, including the advanced countries of Europe, there are 
feudal survivals. Are we to wait for capitalism to abolish these before making 
the revolution? If so we would have to put off the revolution till doomsday. It 
should be obvious that all survivals from feudalism and even earlier periods 
will be finally destroyed by the workers' revolution. History does not wait 
till the last feudal custom has been abolished before imperatively demanding the 
preparation of a new stage.</p>

<p>Ridley's point (b) is also incorrect. Socialism, no more than any other 
system of society, is not a question merely of consumption, but of production. 
The Socialist Revolution is historically necessary above all because capitalism 
hampers the growth of the productive forces which have reached their limit, 
comparatively, under the capitalist system. If it was a question of utilising 
only the productive resources created by capitalism, there would be no future 
for socialism. But on the contrary, the freeing of the productive forces from 
the fetters of capitalism would lay the basis for an increase in the productive 
capacity undreamed of in former societies. Only an enormous increase in 
production would lay the basis for the disappearance of the State. Apparently it 
is necessary to remind these utopians that it is necessary to <em>produce</em> 
before you can <em>consume</em>. An artificial separation on the lines suggested 
by Ridley is quite meaningless. Socialists are as much concerned with production 
as consumption.</p>

<p>Point (c) is just so much hot air but is positively dangerous insofar as it 
sows illusions as to the methods by which the workers can achieve their 
emancipation, in the usual petty bourgeois fashion placing on the same plane, 
workers' dictatorship and the dictatorship of Fascism.</p>

<p>Brockway, in his comments on Ridley's Memorandum betrays the same incapacity 
to face the problem as do all the centrists. When it comes to the question of 
the basis on which the new International is to be built, Ridley is nebulous. 
Brockway recognises the need to &quot;prepare&quot; for the new International at least in 
words. But his method of preparing is, to say the least, most peculiar. &quot;First, 
we should continue to explore all possible contacts in all possible countries, 
with a view to preparing a nucleus to rally round the New International.&quot;</p>

<p>This sounds much like some Rotarian society, oozing good-will to all and 
attempting to maintain &quot;International&quot; connections. It should be obvious that 
before an International Party (or a national Party for that matter) can be 
built, there must be at least a basic agreement on policy and principles. The 
collapse of the London Bureau was determined by the fact that the Parties 
which composed it did not have a common principled position on the fundamental 
problems of our time. Now Brockway's method of issuing questionnaires much on 
the lines of an inquiry to decide which brand of beer is preferred by the 
public, might be a good test for the latter, but is certainly not a method of 
building an International. The I.L.P. here faithfully continues in its centrist 
tradition. Nothing is laid down, nothing fixed in advance. Questions are 
addressed to all sorts of dubious individuals, grouplets and parties  and what 
questions! There is not one that contains any real Marxian content which would 
help to demarcate reformists from revolutionists, muddle heads from those who 
know where they are going and how they intend getting there. Take a couple of 
examples:</p>

<p>&quot;What do you regard as the reasons for the failure of the Second and Third 
Internationals? Why is it that the Second International was so ineffective in 
influencing political events whilst its industrial counter-parts, the 
International Federation of Trades Unions and perhaps particularly the 
International Trade Union Centres (like the International Transport Workers 
Federation, Textile Workers and Miners) appear to have been more effective? Do 
you think the first step towards international working class unity would be to 
concentrate on the strengthening of international Trade Union organisation (e.g. 
the formation of an all-in Federation, including the Russian Trade Unions, the 
C.I.O., etc.) and the extension of International Centres for Trade Unions in 
particular industries rather than on a Socialist International?&quot; </p>

<p>What is meant by the Trade Union Internationals being more effective than the 
Second International and achieving more results, it is not given to ordinary 
mortals to understand. And how it can be suggested that the Russian &quot;Trade 
Unions&quot; which long ago ceased to be trade unions in any sense of the word and 
became mere appendages of the Stalinist bureaucratic regime would strengthen 
internationalism is more than a mystery. But it follows naturally from the 
unclear conceptions of centrism. They howl about the amoral dictatorship of 
Stalinism one day, only to prepare as in this case to embrace its tools 
disguised as trade union leaders, the next.</p>

<p>Another sample:</p>

<p>&quot;What elements do you think should be invited to collaborate in preparation 
for a New International? Revolutionary Socialists only? Social Democrats? 
Communists? Trotskyists? Anarchists? Syndicalists? Reformist Trade Unionist 
Organisations? Co-operative Organisations.&quot;</p>

<p>It should have been clear to the merest political child that all these 
tendencies are mutually incompatible and fundamentally opposed to one another. 
To attempt to reconcile them is impossible. Anyone who has not learned the 
fundamental distinction between Bolshevism</p>

<p>(Trotskyism) and the other tendencies in the last two decades, has learned 
nothing from history. This is emphasised by the next point:</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think there should be a fundamental basis, defining both the 
socialist objective and policy? Is a statement of socialist objective necessary 
in view of the experiences of Nazism and of developments in the Soviet Union? 
For example, do you think it necessary to emphasise the democratic, libertarian 
and equalitarian aspects of Socialism? Do you think the time is ripe for a 
synthesis of the Marxist and Anarchist conceptions of social structure?&quot;</p>

<p>After the shameful betrayal of its so-called principles by anarchism in the 
Spanish revolution, one could expect the petty bourgeois utopianism of 
anarchism, would be exposed clearly for all claiming to be Marxist. To try to 
unite fire and water would be much more simple than the feat of uniting 
anarchist chimeras with Marxist science. All the other questions in this 
questionnaire are of similar character.</p>

<p>However, Brockway's comment as does the questionnaire refers to, flow from 
the conceptions developed by Ridley. In dealing with his questionnaire, Brockway 
remarks with pride: &quot;The responses which we have already had to our 
communications [obviously on the lines of this questionnaire - EG] are 
encouraging and the possibilities of this exploration have only been begun.&quot; 
Very likely. A document which says nothing and commits to nothing, is something 
which any reformist or opportunist can support. Presumably Brockway has received 
encouraging responses from the &quot;brother party&quot; in the U.S.A, Norman Thomas' 
Socialist Party which merely differs over the trifling question of the war  
they support the Allies while Brockway claims to oppose the war. Or the new 
party South Africa which has been so enthusiastically hailed by the &quot;New Leader&quot; 
 opportunist through and through, which not only supports the war but speaks 
for the white minority only, also a mere detail that the I.L.P. disagrees with.
</p>

<p>&quot;...it is important,&quot; says Brockway, &quot;that during the period before the mass 
movement towards a New International arises, international socialists in all 
countries should be thinking out again their ideas of Socialism and the best 
organisational basis for a New International. We must not aspire to lay down any 
theoretical basis in its final form, but it will be a valuable thing if 
Socialists in different countries are pooling their ideas so that out of this 
exchange of opinion a restatement of Socialism can be contributed to the 
discussion when a New International comes 'on the map'.&quot;</p>

<p>An organisation that was seriously Marxist, if it wished to inaugurate an 
international discussion on the way the New International should be built, would 
lay down the principles and ideas which it considered the experience of the 
last period had demonstrated as valid. It would attempt to sharply 
differentiate the sheep from the goats; revolutionists from reformists and 
syndicalist confusionists. That is the method of Trotsky, and the method with 
which Lenin built the Communist International  when it was revolutionary. In 
predicting years in advance the debacle of the London Bureau, when a Marxist 
analysis of its principled or rather lack of principled basis, enabled him to 
discern its inevitable fate, Trotsky wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;A 'revolutionary' resolution for which the opportunists could also vote was 
deemed by Lenin to be not a success but a fraud and a crime. To him, the task of 
all conferences consisted not in presenting a 'respectable' resolution, but in 
effecting the selection of militants and organisations that would not betray the 
proletariat in the hours of stress and storm.&quot; </p>

<p>And in this is summed up the only sound method of laying the basis for mass 
parties of the working class which can lead the toilers to victory.</p>

<p>After solemnly repeating most of Ridley's errors, Brockway attempts to tackle 
the question of the organisational basis of the International, and in doing so 
finds himself on the horns of a dilemma of peculiar Centrist construction.</p>

<p>&quot;The Second International failed organisationally because it was not much 
more than a discussional body afraid to give a lead to any of its sections.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An International ought to be able to express the considered view of the 
international working class movement to its different sections, and different 
sections ought to pay very considerable regard to the lead given in this way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The Communist International, on the other hand, failed because it was 
too rigid in</p>

<p>organisation. Its policy and finance were dominated by the Communist Party of 
Russia and all other sections had to turn as it ordered. This is the other 
extreme which must be avoided.</p>

<p>We must think out a basis of organisation which is between these two; and, 
which is realistically a reflection of the degree to which national sections in 
their present stage of development are likely to accept a lead from an 
International Centre.&quot; </p>

<p>Brockway has not realised that fundamental political questions must be 
reflected in organisational method. Fundamentally differing political tendencies 
cannot be reconciled within the framework of a single organisation either 
nationally or internationally, but sooner or later must be torn apart when the 
question of action arises. All tendencies are tested in the fires of the class 
struggle which brooks of no evasion or subterfuge. Thus a genuine proletarian 
International can only be built on the basis of agreement on the question of 
principles. This in itself presupposes that all questions of major political 
importance which vitally affect the policy of the national parties, should come 
up for international discussion and decision. While of course, a great amount of 
flexibility, especially oil secondary questions, is desirable, this should not 
affect the basic issue. An International should not be a post-bag to which one 
politely sends reports of decisions. Nor an International Congress a fraternal 
meeting where the progress of the different sections is merely recorded. In 
Lenin's day the Comintern was a live body, where after full discussion of 
disputed questions throughout the sections, final decisions were referred for 
International discussion and decision to the World Conference, where important 
questions were fully discussed for days and sometimes weeks. The International 
was a live democratic organisation and not at all &quot;rigid in organisation&quot; in the 
sense of being bureaucratically controlled. True it is that the Russian Party 
possessed an enormous and even predominant influence in the Councils of the 
International. But this was a <em>political</em> influence, due to the tremendous 
experience and authority of the Bolshevik Party. Lenin always insisted on 
thorough democratic discussion on all questions. And while inflexible on 
questions of principle, always preferred where possible to convince comrades by 
experience on questions of tactics. The later degeneration of the Communist 
International began as a political degeneration which reflected itself in 
organisational method as well. Thus, from <em>democratic</em> discussion and 
decision, bureaucratic decisions were decided on in advance, and all voting 
decisions became merely meaningless gestures, till the Communist International 
ended up with the totalitarian &quot;unanimous&quot; decision on all questions. But to 
compare the organisational methods of the Comintern in Lenin's day with those of 
decline under Stalin, or even Bukharin and Zinoviev, and to argue that they were 
the same could only be done by a centrist who wished to reject all international 
discipline. Or perhaps Brockway is still smarting with the recollection of the 
conditions for membership which the International proposed to apply to all 
parties proposing to affiliate? These principled conditions clearly laid it down 
for all to see those parties which really wished to take the road of revolution 
and those who refused to break once and for all with reformism. It is 
interesting to note after all these years, with their rich experience of 
vicissitudes and crises for the I.L.P., after wobbling many times in policy, 
sometimes moving right, sometimes moving left, that they have gone back to the 
position of the I.L.P. of 1920: rejecting one of the fundamental principles of 
Marxism, the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>

<p>Brockway wishes to have his cake and eat it, to be part of an International 
without accepting any responsibility for its decisions and to accept the 
results of the International's deliberations. Brockway's is a typical evasive 
and vague formulation of the question which ties any organisation accepting it 
to nothing. &quot;An international ought to be able to express...different 
sections ought to pay very considerable regard...&quot; How much is very 
considerable regard? What is it supposed to mean? Exactly nothing! Perhaps like 
the I.L.P. itself the international should explain its views to the national 
section which will listen with &quot;considerable regard&quot; and then proceed to carry 
on as usual with its own policy, much as the I.L.P. behaves in its internal 
working or as the London Bureau proceeded in the days when it pursued a 
fictional existence. </p>

<p>That this is what Brockway really means, is shown by his criticism of the 
Communist International. <b>&quot;</b>We must think out a basis of organisation which 
is between these two&quot; Neither Brockway nor any other mortal could resolve the 
contradiction which is posed by this idea. Only Centrists who live in a world of 
make-believe, or cloudy phrases and ideas would even, pretend to suggest that it 
is possible. Marxism-Leninism showed the method of building the party nationally 
and internationally: on the basis of democratic centralism. Brockway puts the 
issue beyond doubt by leaving the back door open in advance: &quot;a basis of 
organisation (must be thought out) which is realistically a reflection of the 
degree to which national sections in their present stage of development are 
likely to accept a lead from an international Centre.&quot; If the individual 
sections have not developed into or as one international party, <em>why pretend 
that an International exists? </em>Far better to declare openly that there is no 
basis for an International at all than participate in a farce of this nature.</p>

<p>The Second International and its sections would gladly have accepted such an 
interpretation of internationalism&quot;. It differs in nothing essential from the 
very practice which Brockway criticises. It leaves the door open to every sort 
of abuse. Who is to decide &quot;realistically&quot; anyway?</p>

<p>It is clear that the conceptions of the I.L.P. on revolutionary organisation 
are as vague and woolly as their ideas on revolutionary policy. The world 
situation poses more imperiously than ever before the necessity for a 
revolutionary vanguard on an international scale. An international which bases 
itself on the principles worked out by Marxism. It is not a question of a 
number, but to repeat the idea developed by Trotsky so long ago. The 
International &quot;is not at all a 'form' as flows from the utterly false 
formulation of the I.L.P. The International is first of all a programme and a 
system of strategic, tactical and organisational methods that flow from it.&quot;</p>

<em>
<p>Comrades of the I.L.P. study our documents in the light of events, examine 
again the ephemeral and contradictory ideas developed by the I.L.P. leadership 
in Conference documents in the last few years. A thorough and honest analysis 
will convince you that only under the banner and with the programme and method 
of the Fourth International can victory be obtained.</p>
