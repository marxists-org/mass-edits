<p class="indentb"><span class="inote">[This was written as an introduction to the RCP's republication
of Trotsky's <a href="../../../trotsky/germany/1931/311126.htm">Germany - The key to the International Situation</a>.]</span></p>


<p class="fst">The imminent defeat of Hitler raises many
questions as to the past and future of Germany. According to the
reports at the Quebec Conference<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup>, <em>What to do with Germany</em>
once she has been defeated has loomed large as the problem which
is worrying the spokesmen of Anglo-American imperialism. They
consider this to be as grave and thorny a problem as the
destruction of German imperialist power itself. Their fears as to
the possibility of maintaining control of Germany by means of
Allied armies of occupation has led the imperialists to launch a
virulent hate campaign. Now at the head of the gang, spewing
forth the foul doctrines of racialism and nationalism, of
indiscriminate hatred of the Germans as a nation, thus emulating
the worst features of the racial doctrine of the nazis, stands
the so-called Communist Party leadership. In the rear, but more
cautiously, for fear of their own membership, the Labour leaders,
faithfully echo the Vansittart<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup> teaching of their
imperialist master.</p>


<p>But the fate of Germany today, as it has been
for many decades, remains a key question for the fate of Europe.
The reason for the insistence of the ruling class and of Stalin
on the formula of unconditional surrender, lies in their fear of
the socialist revolution which is rapidly maturing within
Germany. Once the heavy band of the Gestapo and the SS has been
removed there will be no organised force capable of maintaining
the repression of the German masses. During the rule of Hitler,
monstrous crimes and repressions on the part of the nazis have
engendered a hatred which has few parallels in history. An
enormous explosion is being prepared which threatens not only to
blow the Nazi Party to smithereens but threatens the whole of the
capitalist system itself. Every worker in Germany knows that it
is the combines, monopolies, trusts and big capitalists who
organised Hitler and placed him in control. As Rauschning<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">(3)</a></sup>, the
ex-nationalist, ex-nazi Gauleiter of Danzig has pointed out, the
expropriation of the Jews leads inevitably to the posing of the
problem of expropriation of all the capitalists. It is not for
nothing that Hitler has attempted to give his demagogy a
'socialist' coloration. This reflects the aspirations not alone
of the German workers but the overwhelming majority of the German
population as a whole. In the past few decades all the forms of
capitalist exploitation and political rule have been tried and
found wanting. Inevitably the socialist revolution will be
automatically posed with the fall of Hitler.</p>


<p>But this is precisely what the ruling class of
Britain and America and the traitors in the Kremlin fear more
than anything else. The spectre of a Geman revolution - of a new
and this time <em>completed </em>1918, is their main preoccupation
now that German militarism is in its death throes.</p>


<p>The instinct of the working class in the Allied
countries is, while maintaining implacable hatred for fascism, to
distinguish between the fascist thugs and the ordinary German
worker. Profiting from their experience after the last world war
when all the armies of occupation fraternised with the German
masses (who easily convinced them that they were no different
from themselves) the ruling class are attempting to place
barriers in the way of its reoccurrence. The army staffs of both
Britain and America have backed up the ideological campaign of
chauvinist incitement by strict orders threatening punishment to
any soldiers fraternising with German civilians.</p>


<p>The attitude of the British and American
workers to the German workers can decide the fate of the coming
German revolution and in so doing, will also decide whether there
is to be a new version of fascism and imperialist World War
Three. Under these conditions the necessity to enlighten the
British masses as to the history and meaning of German events, at
least since the last world war, becomes doubly important. It
becomes necessary to restate the most elementary propositions of
Marxism. Today, those traitors who point the finger of scorn at
the German workers pretend that it is the fault of the German
workers that Hitler came to power. They attempt to evade their
own historic responsibility for this catastrophe. In commenting
on the murder of Thaelmann<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-4" name="doc-4">(4)</a></sup>
the <em>Daily Worker </em>cynically says that he fought
for the united front in Germany with all other working class
organisations in order to destroy fascism. That is why it is all
the more necessary to explain to the British and other workers
exactly what did take place. The new generation, in particular,
must understand the part Stalinism played in German events prior
to Hitler's seizure of power, if they wish to understand its
present role.</p>


<p>Thaelmann has been murdered by the nazis
together with tens of thousands of other victims of the fascist
barbarians. But it is necessary to speak the truth if there are
to be no more victims of the system which produced Hitler. Now
the Stalinists wish to use Thaelmann's martyrdom as a cover for
their crimes against the German people. All the more necessary
then, to show the role that Stalinism played in the rise of
Hitler.</p>


<p>The truth of the matter is that the Stalinists
devoted the major part of their energy to ridiculing the danger
of the nazis and concentrated their whole attention on fighting
the social democrats as the 'main enemy'. They fought vicously
against Trotsky's suggestion that the united front was the only
means of smashing Hitler and preparing the way for the victory of
the working class. From the lips of Thaelmann himself we get the
following:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Trotsky wants in all seriousness a common
action of the Communists with the murderer of Liebknecht and Rosa
(Luxemburg), and more, with Mr Zoergiebei<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-5" name="doc-5">(5)</a></sup> and those police chiefs
whom the Papen regime leaves in office to oppress the workers.
Trotsky has attempted several times in his writings to turn aside
the working class by demanding negotiations between the chiefs of
the German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party.
(Thaelmann's closing speech at the 12th Plenum, September 1932,
Executive Committee of the Communist International.&quot; (<em>Communist
International </em>No 17-18, page 1329)</p>


<p class="fst">The Stalinists went even further, openly
inciting the communist workers to beat up socialist workers,
break up their meetings, etc, even carrying the fight to the
school children in the very playgrounds! Thaelmann even put
forward openly the slogan &quot;<em>Chase the social fascists from
their jobs in the plants and the trade unions</em>.&quot; Following on
this line of the leader, the Young Communist organ <em>The Young
Guard</em> propounded the slogan: &quot;<em>Chase the social
fascists from the plants, the employment exchanges, and the
apprentice schools</em>.&quot;</p>


<p>But the line has to be carried through to the
end. In the organ of the Young Pioneers which catered for the
communist children, the <em>Drum</em>, the 'unifying' slogan is put
forward:</p>


<p class="quote"><em>&quot;Strike the little Zoergiebels in the
schools and the playgrounds</em>.&quot;</p>


<h4>Thaelmann Denounced the United Front</h4>

<p>Thaelmann indignantly repudiated the very
thought of a united front with the Social Democratic Party. In an
article published in <em>Die Internationale, </em>November,
December 1931, page 488:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;It [the Social Democratic Party]
threatens to make a united front with the Communist Party. The
speech of Breitscheid<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-6" name="doc-6">(6)</a></sup> (whose murder was announced at the same time as
Thaelmann's) at Darmstadt on the occasion of the Hesse elections
and the comments of <em>Vorwaerts </em>on this speech show that
social democracy by his manoeuvre is drawing on the wall the
devil of Hitler's fascism and is holding back the masses from the
real struggle against the dictatorship of finance capital. And
these lying mouthfuls...they hope to make them more palatable
with the sauce of a so-called friendship for the communists
[against the prohibition of the German CP] and to make them more
agreeable to the masses.&quot;</p>


<p class="fst">And again in a vehement attack on Trotsky:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;In his pamphlet on the question, <em>How
will National Socialism be Defeated?, </em>Trotsky gives always
but one reply: 'The German CP must make a bloc with the Social
Democracy...' In framing this bloc, Trotsky sees the only way for
completely saving the German working class against fascism. <em>Either
the CP will make a bloc with the social democracy or the German
working class is lost for 10-20 years.</em></p>


<p class="quote">&quot;This is the theory of a completely ruined
fascist and counter-revolutionary. This theory is the worst
theory, the most dangerous theory and the most criminal that
Trotsky has constructed in the last years of his
counter-revolutionary propaganda.&quot; (Thaelmann, closing
speech at the 13th Plenum, September 1932: <em>Communist
International</em>, No. 17-18, page 1329.)</p>


<p class="fst">But it is not necessary to deal with the dupe.
The founthead of this criminal policy was Joseph Stalin. He even
put forward the nonsensical theory that the Socialist Party and
the fascists were one and the same thing:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Fascism, said Stalin, is the fighting
organisation of the bourgeoisie, which rests upon the active
support of the social democracy. Objectively, the social
democracy is the moderate wing of fascism. There is no reason to
admit that the fighting organisation of the bourgeoisie could
obtain decisive successes either in the struggles or in the
government of the country without the active support of the
social democracy...There is also little reason to admit that
social democracy can obtain decisive successes either in
struggles or in the government of the country without the active
support of the fighting organisation of the bourgeoisie. <em>These
organisations are not mutually exclusive, but on the contrary are
mutually complementary. They are not antipodes but twins. </em>Fascism
is a shapeless bloc of these two organisations. Without this bloc
the bourgeoisie could not remain at the helm.&quot; (Stalin, quoted in <em>Die
Internationale</em>, February 1932.)</p>


<p class="fst">In carrying out this theory the wise Manuilsky<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-7" name="doc-7">(7)</a></sup> had
explained at the 11th Plenum of the Communist International April
1931:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The social democrats, in order to deceive
the masses, deliberately proclaim that the chief enemy of the
working class is fascism...Is it not true that the whole theory
of the 'lesser evil' rests on the presupposition that fascism of
the Hitler type represents the chief enemy?&quot; (<em>The
Communist Parties and the Crisis of Capitalism, </em>page 112)</p>


<p class="fst">It was with this revision of all the teachings
of Lenin that the Communist Party of Germany, with the assistance
of the social democracy, confused and paralysed the workers and
then handed them over without a battle into the hands of the
fascist executioner.</p>


<p>The British hypocrites who now slander the
German workers applauded this policy of betrayal at the time when
the revolutionary socialists were raising their voice all over
the world in an effort to prevent the tragedy which was impending
in Germany. 'It is significant', jeered the <em>Daily Worker </em>of
May 26th, 1932, 'that Trotsky has come out in defence of a united
front between the Communist and Social Democratic Parties against
fascism. No more disruptive and counter revolutionary class lead
could possibly have been given at a time like the present'.</p>


<p>At the eleventh hour,just before Hitler's
coming to power, Ralph Fox wrote in the <em>Communist Review
</em>of December 1932:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The Communist Party of Germany has now
succeeded in winning the majority of the working class in the
decisive industrial areas, where it is now the <em>first party </em>in
Germany. The only exceptions are Hamburg and Saxony, but even
here the Party vote has enormously increased at the expense of
the social democrats.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;These successes have been won only by the
most unswerving carrying through of the line of the Party and the
Comintern. Insisting all the time that social democracy is the
chief social support of capitalism, the Party has carried on
intense and unceasing struggle against the German Social
Democratic Party, and the new 'Independent Socialist Labour
Party', as well as against the right wing and Trotskyist
renegades who wanted the party of the proletariat to make a
united front with social fascism against fascism.&quot;</p>


<p class="fst">It is this suicidal policy of Stalinism against
which Trotsky and the International Left opposition waged a
struggle in the critical years 1930-3 when the fate of Germany
hung in the balance. Trotsky's works on Germany will remain
forever as textbooks on the problem of the united front. They
will serve as models for the revolutionary movement of the
future. That we commence publication of Trotsky's material on
this question in England for the first time, is a reflection on
the revolutionary movement in Britain. Every student who desires
an understanding of the degeneration of Stalinism will study this
material with great care.</p>


<p>Even though <em>Germany - The Key to the
International Situation </em>was written in 1931, it retains its
freshness at the present time. The outline of the situation, not
only in Germany, but in the other countries dealt with, indicates
clearly Trotsky's profound understanding of the political process
of development of our period. Trotsky and the Fourth
International alone warned of the catastrophe that the coming to
power of Hitler would mean for the workers of Germany, Europe and
of the Soviet Union. When the Stalinists refused to learn the
lesson of events, and in a most cowardly way, surrendered the
German masses to Hitler without a fight, or even a shot being
fired; when they even went so far as to proclaim the coming to
power of Hitler as a <em>victory </em>for the working class - as it
expressed the crisis of capitalism and his victory was merely
that of the caliph of an hour, boastfully proclaiming 'our turn
next' - it was then that Trotsky proclaimed the end of the
Comintern as a force making for world socialism.</p>


<p>How pitiful, how despicable are the writings of
the pen prostitutes of the Kremlin on Germany, when the real
historical events are analysed. These Dutts<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-8" name="doc-8">(8)</a></sup>, these
Rusts, these Ehrenburgs, not satisfied with having betrayed the
German workers into the hands of the Nazis, now systematically
disseminate chauvinist poison to the Allied workers in order to
assist Anglo-American imperialism to enslave the German people.
Having proved incapable of leading the German workers to victory,
they now actively oppose the socialist revolution in Germany.
Thus as always in politics, ineptness and stupidity, if not
corrected, become transformed into treachery.</p>


<p>The German and British workers will yet present
their accounts not only to their imperialist oppressors but to
their hirelings in the ranks of the working class. Once the
working class realises the full depth of their treachery, like
the traducers of the Commune, they will forever be held to scorn
in the memory of the working class.</p>


<p>It would have been impossible to conceive that
elements claiming to represent the working class should stoop to
such depths as the Stalinists. From the social democrats nothing
more could have been expected - they remained faithful to their
past tradition of reformist betrayal. The Stalinists have often
enough in the past referred to the murder of Liebknecht and
Luxemburg and the betrayal of the revolution of 1918. But nothing
in their record could equal the long list of crimes marked up to
the account of Stalinism.</p>


<p>Surely, all the gods must have laughed at the
spectacle of the Stalinist leaders solemnly intoning that it was
necessary to 're-educate' the German workers - and their
educators? Allied imperialism and Stalinism! Yes, re-education is
necessary! Re-education of the ranks of the working class as to
the role of the leadership of the organisations claiming to
represent them. Re-education which will assist them to burn out
the cancer of Stalinism and reformism which will lead the workers
only to further catastrophe. In order to accomplish the task of
'educating' not only the German but the British and world
workers, it is necessary that the advanced guard should be
trained and armed with a knowledge of the Marxist method and of
the history of past defeats. As an indispensable means of
understanding the position in Germany today, it is necessary for
the workers to conscientiously study the works of Trotsky. <em>Germany
is still the key to the international Situation</em> - with an
understanding and with a knowledge of the past and future tasks
we will go forward to the building of a new socialist world.</p>



<h4>Notes (from <em>The Unbroken Thread</em>)</h4>

<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-1" name="foot-1">(1)</a></sup> Towards the end
of the war a series of talks took place, one in Quebec (in 1943),
between Churchill and Roosevelt on problems which would emerge
for imperialism at the end of the war, especially in the Balkans,
central Europe and Germany.</p>


<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-2" name="foot-2">(2)</a></sup> Robert
Vansittart, head of the Foreign Office, opposed the policy of
appeasement towards Hitler, but primarily from an anti-German
stance, while paying lip-service to anti-fascism.</p>


<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-3" name="foot-3">(3)</a></sup> Hermann
Rauschning was a capitalist who initially supported the nazis as
opponents of the organised working class but then changed his
position when the nazis became out of control, publishing a book,
<em>We Never Wanted This. </em>In nazi Germany a Gauleiter was a
district 'leader'.</p>


<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-4" name="foot-4">(4)</a></sup> Ernst Thaelmann
joined the German Communist Party in 1920, he became its leader
with Stalin's support in 1925. Arrested by the nazis in 1933, he
was murdered in 1944.</p>


<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-5" name="foot-5">(5)</a></sup> Karl Zoergiebel
was the Social Democratic commissioner of the Berlin police.
Fritz von Papen was appointed Chancellor on June 1 1932. On July
20 he removed the Social Democratic government of Prussia. He
became vice chancellor under Hitler.</p>


<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-6" name="foot-6">(6)</a></sup> Rudolf
Breitscheid (1876-1945) was a socialist deputy in the Reichstag.
He fled to France when Hitler came to power and was handed over
to the Nazis by the Vichy regime. <em>Vorwaerts</em> was the
central organ of the SPD.</p>


<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-7" name="foot-7">(7)</a></sup> Dimitri
Manuilsky was secretary of the Comintern 1931-43.</p>


<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-8" name="foot-8">(8)</a></sup> Prominent
Stalinist publicists, Dutt and Rust of the British CP and
