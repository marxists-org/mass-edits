The
measures of the government to impose a &ldquo;total freeze on wages and prices&rdquo; for
six months follow on the same lines as those of the Conservative government,
except that the measures of the government are even more severe. The amount
taken out of consumption amounts to &pound;1,500 million. Prices will not remain
stable, measures introduced by the government will themselves result in an
increase in prices. Meanwhile the profits of the employers will continue to
rise as usual. While &ldquo;dividends&rdquo; will remain frozen, they will pile up till the
end of the period of the freeze. &ldquo;Bonus&rdquo; shares issued by the more profitable
concerns will disguise the extent of the extra profits made.
</p>
<p>
At the same
time, the endemic crisis of British capitalism will be further increased.
Government expenditure on capital equipment will be cut, while there will be a
cut of &pound;150 million in government military and overseas expenditure on
investments. This will not solve the crisis even if carried out.
</p>
<h4>&ldquo;Plan&rdquo; abandoned</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
&ldquo;modernisation plan&rdquo; has become an object of mirth to the Tory politicians and
the capitalist class. One reason why the capitalists were not too averse to
seeing a Labour victory at this election was to cover the idea of a &ldquo;socialist
plan&rdquo; with ridicule.
</p>
<p>
The squeeze
measures will result in a fall in investment in manufacturing industry, it is
estimated by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) by 7
percent in 1966 and 7 percent in 1967. The so-called national plan called for
an increase of 7 percent in investment every year up to 1970. So that all the
lavish hand-outs to big business have not solved the problem of the British
economy in any way. The balance of payments crisis every two years is caused by
the interests of the City of London bankers and speculators, the manufacturers
who invest abroad, and of course the &pound;500 to &pound;600 million spent in defending
the interests of those same bankers and capitalists.
</p>
<p>
The
imposition of a 10 percent increase in surtax, while irritating the surtax
payers&mdash;and it does not bring surtax to the level which existed before Tory
governments slashed the tax&mdash;cannot by any stretch of the imagination be
compared to the burdens being imposed on the working class, and to some extent
on the middle class as well.
</p>
<p>
Wilson,
Callaghan and Brown dreamed of running capitalism better than the capitalists
and their representatives the Tory Party. They seriously believed that
capitalism could be &ldquo;planned.&rdquo; The result for the labour movement is the
disastrous squeeze dictated by the capitalists and caused by the world and
national market conditions which dominate the economy. Their acceptance of the
dictates of big business, while trying to give some sops to the working class
and labour movement cannot satisfy either. There cannot be a middle way between
the working class and the capitalist class. The profits of the capitalists are
extracted from the unpaid labour of the working class. The old saying is that
it is impossible to serve two masters, it is even more impossible to serve two
opposed classes.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Financial Times</i> of the 7<sup>th</sup> of
August correctly observes in an editorial written from the point of view of
their class:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;The
belief that it is on occasion right to seek to achieve social objectives by
interference with market forces is to some extent shared by all political
parties. But, as Mr. Wilson and his colleagues are now painfully discovering,
there are very definite limits beyond which one cannot go without causing
serious economic damage&hellip;under the most unfavourable economic circumstances the
attempt is made to reconcile the irreconcilable.&rdquo;
</p>
<h4>Reduced consumption</h4>
<p class="fst">
They then
point out that the incomes freeze is deliberately intended to reduce
consumption (of the people as a whole, the capitalists will not be affected).
But of course, like the Confederation of British Industry, they object to
prices being frozen, because this will cut into profit margins and affect the
ability of &ldquo;industry&rdquo; i.e. the owners of industry, to reinvest the extra money
gained from the labour of the workers.
</p>
<p>
From the
viewpoint of a capitalist economy this is correct. No amount of penalties can
affect the workings of a capitalist economy for very long. Employers and
workers &ldquo;violating the freeze are liable to fines of &pound;100 on a summary
conviction, &pound;500 on an indictment of someone failing to observe the
obligations, and unlimited fines on both unions and employers who induce a body
to make a breach.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
All these
measures have been tried in Holland where they have had a wages freeze for a
number of years. They have failed in their objectives both as regards prices
and wages. A black market has been established.
</p>
<h4>Taff-Vale</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
building of the Labour Party as a mass force in Parliament was given an impetus
in support from the trade unions and working class by the reactionary Taff-Vale
1906 court decisions. Now the Cabinet is reversing the procedure.
</p>
<p>
These
latest measures are unprecedented for Britain. They have not been introduced
even in war-time by any capitalist government. One has to go back to the Middle
Ages for a precedent of legislation forcibly holding down wages! And this has
been introduced by a government which won the election because of the support
of the organised labour movement, the trade unions and constituency parties!
</p>
<p>
But just as
it is impossible to prevent market forces asserting themselves from the point
of view of the capitalists, so it is impossible to prevent the labour movement
and the working class from resisting these attacks on their standards of
living.
</p>
<p>
Already it
is in the balance whether the government can gain a majority at the TUC and
Labour Party conferences for their policies. Cousins and the T&amp;GWU are
opposed. The NUM, USDAW and many others including &ldquo;white collar unions,&rdquo; have
rejected the incomes policy and freeze.
</p>
<h4>Unemployment</h4>
<p class="fst">
When
unemployment, which has already increased slightly in July, begins to rise up
to the expected 600,000, then the opposition of the workers will become
manifest. A section of the left wing Labour Members of Parliament have voted
against the policy. But Wilson has a case when he argues that on the present
economic system the alternatives offered by the left opposition MPs are no
solution. Cousins argues for increased productivity. But with present world
conditions this will mean increased unemployment.
</p>
<p>
Other
capitalist governments are introducing similar measures and threaten to catch
the &ldquo;English&rdquo; sickness in the economy. They are increasing productivity and
beginning to meet resistance from their own workers. Sweden, the &ldquo;model&rdquo; for
relations between the classes was recently at the point of a threatened general
strike. Increased modernisation means. increased expenditure on capital
equipment and after a period, a fall in the rate of profit. Hence the attempt
to hold down and decrease the share of the working class in what they produce
in all the capitalist countries.
</p>
<h4>Independence for unions</h4>
<p class="fst">
Cousins has
objected to the attempt of the Labour leaders to make the unions part of the
capitalist state machine. Those union leaders supporting this process will soon
be compelled to come out in opposition by the pressure of their members.
</p>
<p>
Woodcock,
the general secretary of the TUC, and Cousins, have come out for more workers&rsquo;
participation in the management of the nationalised industries and of private
industry. This is an indication of the mood they expect to develop within the
working class in the coming period.
</p>
<p>
But mere words
in isolated speeches mean very little. It is a question of mobilising trade
union branches, shop stewards&rsquo; committees and constituency parties as a start.
It is a question of a mass campaign of explanation to the working class that
British capitalism is diseased. It needs a surgical operation, the taking over
of the &ldquo;commanding heights of the economy&rdquo; with compensation on the basis of
need only. Then with the banks, insurance companies and private monopolies
nationalised, it would be possible to organise the resources of the nation
democratically, and get the &ldquo;incentive&rdquo; for a great increase in production by
lowering hours and increasing pay. The mass of the people could discuss the
entire plan, with the working class as the leading force. This is the programme
Labour&rsquo;s left must adopt.
