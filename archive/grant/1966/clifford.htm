<p class="fst">Comrade Clifford has raised the question of
Trotskyism in a most peculiar way. We have to ask: What is
Trotskyism? How did it arise? What theories does it represent?
What class interest does it express? Why has the question been
raised today? Because in raising these problems and in raising
what the Trotskyists have said we have the opportunity to
understand the real issues - though not at all, of course, in the
way in which they are posed by Comrade Clifford. Clifford has
thrown down the gage to us. He says that the difference between
Stalin and Mao Tse-Tung, on the one hand, and Trotskyism, is that
one is revolutionary and the other is counter-revolutionary (and
it is obvious that of these two incompatible theories, only one
can be correct in the sense of representing the historical
interests of the working class on a national and international
scale). The question is: which?</p>


<p>In reality, the simple way, the garbled way in
which Clifford tries to dismiss this problem cannot result in
educating anyone as to the real issues themselves. Clifford
repeats in a garbled fashion the fairy tales and lies of Stalin
and of the Stalinists as to the real issues. The problem is in
reality much more complex than simply 'revolutionary' and
'counter-revolutionary', because both stem, in the last analysis,
<em>from the Russian revolution and the fate of the revolution. </em></p>


<p>And if we are to understand the fate of the
revolution, the first thing that is necessary is that when we use
terms used by Marxists, we use them in the sense in which they
were meant by both Marx and Lenin. Otherwise we are not Marxists
at all. We are simply being dishonest.</p>


<p>Comrade Clifford has touched on the question of
the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union, and in
doing so has shown that he <em>does not understand the ABC of what
the dictatorship of the proletariat means. </em>The quotations he
gives from Lenin deal only with one aspect of the dictatorship of
the proletariat, that is - and in that Lenin was 100 per cent
correct - that the dictatorship of proletariat <em>in Russia at
that stage </em>rested on an alliance between the workers and the
peasants and in particular between the workers and poor peasants.</p>


<p>But that does not tell us <em>at all </em>what
the dictatorship of the proletariat <em>is</em>! What then <em>is
</em>the dictatorship of the proletariat? If we understand this
question, all that stems from it will be understood too: whose
interest Trotsky really represented, whose interest Stalin
represented, what are the <em>real issues </em>in the debates that
have taken place between Stalinism and Trotskyism over the past
40 years. And in reality, once one gets down to fundamentals, the
question is not so difficult to understand. First of all, as
Marxists, we base ourselves <em>on the ideas of Marx. </em>Marx
did not suck the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat out
of his thumb. Marx did not come forward with the idea of the
dictatorship ready made. All that happened is that Marx
generalised the experience of the working class in relation to
the Paris Commune of 1871.</p>


<p>What were the ideas that were put forward by
Marx in his book on the Paris Commune? The first point that he
made was one that in the past would have been accepted by those
who claim to stand for communism. Today it is not accepted by the
Moscow communists; it is allegedly accepted by the Peking
communists, but in practice, and as we can see from the way in
which they carry through their diplomatic manoeuvres in the
colonial countries, it is not accepted by them at all. Marx
explained that it is impossible for the proletariat to take over
the old bourgeois machine; that it is necessary, therefore, to
have revolution and to smash the old state machine. And what then
was to replace the bourgeois state machine? <em>That </em>is what
Marx explained is the dictatorship of the proletariat. And when
he spoke of the 'dictatorship' he meant a far more democratic
system, a far wider measure of democracy among the mass of the
people than could ever be realised under bourgeois democracy,
which is the <em>disguised dictatorship </em>of the bourgeois
ruling class.</p>


<p>Lenin, taking up and faithfully reflecting the
ideas of Marx in his book <em>State and Revolution</em>,
<sup><a href="../../lenin/works/1917/staterev/">[source]</a></sup>
restates all the principles on which Marx based his work in the past. And
in order that there should be dictatorship of the proletariat he
explains - as Marx explained - the conditions for the rule of the
working class; adding perhaps to the ideas of Marx the question
of the soviets (which, in its turn, was not whistled out of the
mind of Lenin, Trotsky, Marx or anyone else. but came out of the
initiative and direct experience of the working class itself in
Russia in the revolutions of 1905 and 1917.)</p>


<p>In place of the bourgeois parliament, Lenin
said, once the bourgeois system had been overthrown and the
proletariat had taken power, we would have a system of soviets,
of committees elected by the workers, housewives and even small
shopkeepers, professional people etc, together with the peasants
(which is the impression which Comrade Clifford's 'thesis' would
impart to the unwary - again displaying the continuing capacity
of Stalinism to distort Leninism, to dishonestly misrepresent
Marxism). In 1917 whereas for the workers there was one soviet
representative for every 10,000 votes, for the peasants there was
one for every 100,000.</p>


<p>In other words, the peasants did not have the
same representation in the soviets, once the revolution had taken
place, as the working class; thereby making a distinction between
workers and the peasants; making a clear distinction in the
plebian mass, in the people as a whole, between the workers who
were uncompromisingly devoted to socialism, and the peasants who
would always have tendency to veer, to sway, and to be hesitant
in their support of the dictatorship of the proletariat itself.</p>


<p>The first condition, then, for the rule of the
working class, according to Lenin, is the existence of soviets,
these committees with the right of election and recall. The
second condition that Lenin laid down for the rule of the working
class was that no official was to receive a wage higher than that
of a skilled worker. The third condition was that there was to be
no standing army, but an armed people. The fourth condition was
that there be no permanent bureaucracy: in the words of Lenin
himself, 'every cook should be able to be Prime Minister.'</p>


<p>These are the conditions under which the
dictatorship of the proletariat <em>begins</em>, not where the
dictatorship of the proletariat <em>ends</em>. And here we get the
arguments on the question of the difference between Stalinism and
Trotskyism.</p>


<p>We shall return again to the conditions for the
dictatorship of the proletariat at a later stage in the
discussion.</p>


<h4>Stalinism and Trotskyism</h4>

<p>The difference between Stalinism and Trotskyism
originally arose not on the question of the peasantry. That was
thrown in merely as a disguise, a trick - as Comrade Clifford is
using it as a trick - to confuse the mass of the people in Russia
as to the difference between the Trotskyists and the Stalinists.
The original difference between Stalinism and Trotskyism had
nothing to do with the theory of Permanent Revolution, even. The
original difference arose over the demands of the Left
Opposition, as they were called and - in which demands the Left
Opposition had the full support of Lenin - for a restoration of
workers' democracy in the Soviet Union on the lines of the points
of the dictatorship of the proletariat that have just been
sketched out.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, because of the civil war, the
famine, and because of the retreat that the Bolsheviks had had to
make with the New Economic Policy, which allowed the development
of bourgeois elements in the towns, through the so-called Nepmen,
and in the countryside through the so-called Kulaks - gradually,
more and more the power which the working class had established
in the Soviet Union began to be taken away from them. The same
process as had developed in the past, which Lenin had so
carefully and meticulously analysed in relation to social
democracy, was now taking place <em>after </em>the capture of power
by the proletariat. Lenin had explained the role which social
democracy and the trade union bureaucracy played, not purely from
the point of view of ideas but from the <em>material interests </em>of
the bureaucracy of this movement. This bureaucracy had separated
itself from the working class, only indirectly reflected the
interests of the working class and tried to act as an arbiter
between the working class and the bourgeoisie. <em>That </em>is how
Lenin explained the betrayal of social democracy and of the trade
union bureaucracy in the first world war, when in each country
they came out in full support of their own ruling class. Let us
note that fact, that crude material fact! That the <em>conditions
of existence </em>of the bureaucrats, of the labour and trade
union bureaucrats before the first world war, were the reason for
the change in the consciousness of these bureaucrats and for
their betrayal of the working class.</p>


<p>In Russia, after the victory of the revolution,
the original intention of the Bolsheviks had not been to suppress
<em>even a single party, </em>except of course for the forerunners
of the fascists, the Black Hundreds<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup>.
In the early stages of
the revolution even the liberals, the Constitutional Democrats,
were not suppressed; nor was their press suppressed. Later, the
Bolsheviks were forced to suppress them; then the right-wing
social democrats; then the Left Social Revolutionaries (and, by
the way, it should be remembered that the first government of the
soviets was a coalition government of Bolsheviks and of Left
Social Revolutionaries.) But at each stage, it was because of the
weakness of the revolution, because of the taking up of arms
against the revolution, because of the failure of the
international revolution on which Lenin and Trotsky - as we will
later explain - had based their whole perspective of the future
of the Russian revolution, that these suppressions were made
necessary. Every peasant, every peasant soldier, as John Reed
shows in his <em>Ten Days that Shook the World</em>,
<sup><a href="../../reed/1919/10days/10days/index.htm">[source]</a></sup>
understood the <em>international perspective of the revolution </em>because of the
propaganda of the Bolsheviks.</p>


<p>The differences between Stalinism and
Trotskyism were not differences as to whether the revolution
should be extended into Europe or elsewhere in the early stage of
the Russian revolution. The Russian revolution was prepared, and
began, with the perspective that it was only the beginning of the
revolution in Europe and of the international revolution.</p>


<p>Again, before dealing with this aspect of the
thing, let us examine the arguments that are put forward by
Clifford on the question of the proletarian dictatorship and on
the question of the permanent revolution and the so-called
underestimation of the peasantry - a series of most peculiarly
assembled quotations, taken out of context from Lenin, and which
do not deal with the subject under discussion at all.</p>


<p>What were the conceptions with which the
Russian revolution was prepared? Within the Marxist movement,
within the social democratic movement - because let us remember
that up to 1912 even Bolshevism was not an independent party, as
one would imagine from the statements of Clifford; only in 1912
did the Bolsheviks<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup>
become an independent party - there were certain
theoretical conceptions of how the revolution in Russia was going
to develop. These conceptions were necessary to guide the work of
preparing the victory of the revolution. To take just one aspect
of these conceptions for the moment: Lenin, far from being the
self-centred Russian nationalist which Clifford and the
Stalinists have tried to make him out to be, raised the question
at various stages in the revolution, that if it was necessary for
the German revolution to succeed, which was far more important
than the Russian revolution, then <em>they would even be prepared
to sacrifice the Russian revolution for the victory of the
revolution in Germany. </em>The whole conception of Bolshevism,
and of Leninism, was imbued through and through with ideas of
international socialism. And right through the whole period of
the Russian revolution, this conception was held by Lenin. We can
give not one, but a hundred, a thousand quotations to show that
this was so!</p>


<p>We need mention only one: where Lenin said that
we are bound to the world market, we are bound to world
developments, we cannot solve the problem of the Soviet Union on
our own, <em>we have to hold out - </em>that was the conception of
Lenin! - we have to hold out till the development of the
socialist revolution in the more developed countries of the West.</p>


<p>We might also point out that when, during the
Eighth Congress of the Communist Party of Russia, Podbelsky
inferred that some formulations of the programme had reference
only to the revolution in Russia, Lenin replied as follows in his
concluding speech on the question of the party programme (March
19, 1919):</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Podbelsky has raised objection to a
paragraph which speaks of the pending social revolution...His
argument is obviously unfounded because our programme deals with
the social revolution on a world scale.&quot; (<em>CW</em>, volume
29, page 187)<sup><a href="../../lenin/works/1919/rcp8th/04.htm">[source]</a></sup>
</p>


<p>It will not be out of place here, either, to
point out that at about the same time Lenin suggested that the
party should change its name from the Communist Party of Russia,
so as to emphasise still further that it was a party of
international revolution. Trotsky was the only one voting for
Lenin's motion in the Central Committee.</p>


<p>What then gave rise to the differences between
Stalin and Trotsky? What then gave rise to the victory of Stalin?
Was it because Stalin understood the problems better? Was it
because Trotsky underestimated the peasantry, or any other
nonsense of that character?</p>


<p>On the contrary, again if we use the Marxist
method, we have to see the different material interests which
came to be expressed by these two different tendencies. The
isolation of the revolution (in a backward country at that), the
famine, the civil war etc, led to seizure of control by the
bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, by millions of officials in the
party, in the trade unions, in the army and in industry. These
were the ones who now gradually began to concentrate power in
their hands, as a direct consequence of the exhaustion of the
masses. And the key year when these things came to a head was
1923.</p>


<p>In 1923, that revolution which the Bolsheviks
had expected did have the possibility of taking place in Germany.
Those people who have no faith in the working class, who sneer,
have only to consider how, in one country after another in the
past 40 years, the working class has taken to the road of
revolution; how the workers organised the struggle, how the
workers tried to take power, in Germany, in Hungary, in China, in
Britain, in France, in Italy, in Spain and in other countries -
struggles which, at the moment, we cannot deal with. But at any
rate in 1923 in Germany again an opportunity was given to the
working class to take power into their own hands.</p>


<p>Lenin was ill, Trotsky was ill, and
unfortunately, when the delegation of the German Central
Committee, which was preparing for the revolution in Germany,
arrived in Moscow, the people they met were Stalin and Zinoviev.
And unfortunately, the advice which Stalin gave them was <em>not
to try and take power. </em>In that sense we have the same sort of
crisis which led Trotsky to write his book <em>The Lessons of
October</em>, <sup><a href="../../trotsky/1924/lessons/index.htm">[source]</a></sup>
the same crisis in the leadership as existed in 1917
with Stalin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, and other leaders of the
Bolsheviks who hesitated at the time when the insurrection was
being prepared - in the case of Zinoviev and Kamenev, directly
opposing the insurrection.</p>


<p>It is interesting to note in this regard that
following the February revolution, from February to April 1917,
while Lenin was in Zurich, Stalin and Kamenev (who had returned
to Petersburg) were running <em>Pravda</em>. Lenin daily sent
articles to Petersburg in which he called for no conciliation
with the capitalists. He sent covering letters demanding that
these be published. Stalin and Kamenev refused to publish them.
Instead, during those vital months, they published Stalin's own
miserable bits and pieces of journalism in which Stalin called
for and worked for conciliation with the Mensheviks, who in turn
were calling for conciliation with the bourgeoisie. Stalin in the
pages of <em>Pravda </em>actually described the differences between
Lenin and the Mensheviks as 'a storm in a tea-cup'!</p>


<p>Stalin, not having understood the experience of
1917, gave the advice to the German comrades not to try and take
power, and as a consequence the revolutionary opportunity in
Germany was lost.</p>


<p>As Engels has explained, sometimes twenty years
of history can be summed up in few days; if the revolutionary
leadership of the proletariat does not take advantage of these
days it might be twenty years before a new opportunity would
return. The opportunity was lost for the proletariat to take
power in Germany in 1923, with all the fatal consequences that
that has had for the Russian revolution and the revolutionary
movement on a world scale.</p>


<p>It was the failure of the German revolution
that gave the opportunity to Stalin, who more and more began to
reflect the ideas and interests of the millions of officials and
bureaucrats within the Soviet Union. </p>


<p>What, then, was the programme on which the Left
Opposition was constructed in 1923 and 1924? It was to return to
the ideas of Marxism, of Leninism; to return to the conditions
that Lenin had laid down for the rule of the working class; to
reintroduce workers' democracy in the Bolshevik Party and in the
Soviet state. That was the main plank in the platform of the Left
Opposition.</p>


<p>The second plank, as important as the first,
was the need for the Soviet Union to industrialise, the need for
five-year plans in the Soviet Union. And it is significant, in
relation to the understanding of the problems of Stalinism and
Trotskyism, that the tendency which was against 'socialism in one
country', that tendency which was for international socialism -
that was the tendency which came out for the industrialisation of
the Soviet Union and for five-year plans.</p>


<p>As far as the question of 'socialism in one
country' is concerned, one would pose the question to Comrade
Clifford: If the Bolshevik programme before coming to power was
not based on an international socialist perspective, how did it
happen that in his book <em>Problems of Leninism</em>,
published in January 1924, Stalin said, echoing the Bolshevik programme
adopted after the seizure of power (this idea of international
revolution naturally appears in the Bolshevik programme), that
socialism is impossible in a single country and that six months
later Stalin published a new edition of this book in which he
argues for the exact opposite, that socialism can and must be
built in a single country?</p>


<p>It is here we see the complete lack of
foresight, the complete narrow-mindedness of this bureaucracy and
of Stalin himself. When it was suggested that the five-year plans
should be put into force on the basis of increasing production by
20 per cent a year, it was Stalin, and at that time his ally
Bukharin, who laughed at this. 'sheer adventurism' on the part of
the Opposition.</p>


<p>How could a peasant country like Russia hope to
develop industry faster than the countries of the West, he asked?
In Bukharin's phrase, they would 'reach socialism at a snail's
pace'. And when it was suggested, for example, that the
Dnieperstroy power works - now one of the most famous
hydro-electric schemes in the Soviet Union - should be
constructed, and on which the first five-year plan was based,
Stalin said that to talk about such a project was like suggesting
that a peasant should buy a gramophone instead of a cow. The
whole thing, he said, was beyond the resources of the Soviet
Union at that time.</p>


<p>We can see very clearly from reference to
Trotsky's <em>Revolution Betrayed</em>
<sup><a href="../../trotsky/1936/revbet/index.htm">[source]</a></sup>
what was at stake and what
actually happened in the Soviet Union in those vital years: why
the bureaucracy pursued its course toward the kulak, scoffed at
the 'super industrialisers', and rejected any attempt at
democratisation and a change of policy. Then, suddenly, panic
ensues. The 'impossible' becomes not only possible but
'exceedable'. Those who stood for industrialisation, and gradual
collectivisation on the basis of a growing industry (not on the
basis of a wooden plough and thousand year old methods) while
awaiting the maturing of the revolutionary possibilities in
Western Europe, were locked up, exiled and deported (what
policies the victorious bureaucracy later imposed on the workers
through the Comintern when that revolutionary situation did
mature, we shall see later). The forced collectivisation was then
proceeded with - not as we said on a basis of tractors, but of
wooden ploughs, a few thousand bureaucratic collectivisers and a
large army of police.</p>


<p>The results are well known. The wholesale
destruction of livestock by the peasants, the situation of
virtual civil war with Moscow and other centres surrounded by
armour, millions dead of famine. Today in the Soviet Union 40 per
cent of the total food produced comes from six per cent of the
cultivated land, from the private plots.</p>


<p>So we can see that the argument between
Stalinism and Trotskyism was not whether the Soviet Union should
be developed or not, because the people who were in favour of
developing the Soviet Union were the Left Opposition. The
argument was between those who stood for a thorough <em>democratisation
or re-democratisation </em>of the Soviet Union and those who stood
for a <em>further bureaucratisation </em>of the Soviet Union.</p>


<p>Lenin, in 1924, was already becoming alarmed at
the processes that were taking place in the Soviet Union. And
Lenin, in contradistinction to Stalin and all the acolytes of
Stalin, was always honest and ready to face the facts. And in his
last articles and his last speeches he referred to the fact that
if one took away the 'thin varnish of socialism' (his own words)
which existed in the Soviet Union, there was the same old <em>Tsarist
</em>state machine, the same old <em>Tsarist </em>bureaucracy in
control.</p>


<p>It was precisely because the revolution had
taken place in a country where the working class was only 10 per
cent of the population, precisely because of the backwardness
even of the working class (we must remember the large amount of
illiteracy that existed in the Soviet Union) that the Bolsheviks
were forced to rely largely on the same old <em>Tsarist </em>officials
in the ministries, etc, in order to carry through the
administration of the country. What happened was that the newer
elements in this bureaucracy began to raise themselves above the
level of the working class. These elements moved away from the
conceptions of Marxism, away from the conceptions of Bolshevism.</p>


<p>In the international arena, the developments
that gave Stalin the opportunity to come to power were the defeat
of the working class in Germany in 1923, in 1925-7 in China and
the defeat of the British working class in the general strike of
1926. These were the factors that allowed the bureaucracy in the
Soviet Union to consolidate its power.</p>


<h4>Socialism in One Country - an Anti-Marxist Concept</h4>

<p>Marxists are not internationalists for
abstract, sentimental reasons, just because they think that the
workers of one country must love the workers of another country.</p>


<p>We are internationalists, as Marx explained,
because the whole essence and function of capitalism, apart from
developing the productive forces in each country, are summed up
in the fact that the whole world was drawn into one single
inter-dependent unit by the capitalist system, where every
country is dependent on every other country. The whole world is
drawn by capitalism into one single inter-related economic unit.
It is this which gives us the essence of the internationalism of
the working class. Events that occur in one country affect the
workers of other countries. That is why Lenin, Trotsky, Marx,
Engels and all the great teachers of the working class movement,
always based themselves on internationalism - not from abstract
sentimentalism, but from the actual organic needs of the
development of world economy, from the organic needs of the
working class itself.</p>


<p>How, then, did the idea of 'socialism in one
country', entirely foreign to the ideas of Marxism, appear within
the Soviet Union? The answer, as always given by Marxists, is
that no theory, once it gets mass support or the support of a
large section of people, can be a theory in the abstract; it must
reflect the material interests of classes or of strata within
classes. Whose interest, then, did 'socialism in one country'
reflect? Did it reflect the interests of the Russian workers? Or
did it reflect the interests of the bureaucrats, of the
officialdom within the Soviet Union? Had the same process which
Lenin sketched in relation to the labour bureaucracy in the
industrially advanced Western countries taken place once the
workers in Russia had taken power?</p>


<p>The answer we can give as to whose interests
the idea of socialism in one country represents, has been given
by history itself. <em>There, </em>Comrade Clifford, is the
explanation of why Trotsky and the Left Opposition were defeated,
and why Stalin won! <em>Whose interests </em>were reflected in the
struggle is shown by the development of the Soviet Union itself.
What happened to the Soviet state under Stalin? In the early
stages, nominally, all the conditions that we've spoken about
continued to exist, though the bureaucracy remained corrupt. The
bureaucracy illegitimately <em>stole and had a greater share </em>than
they were allowed according to the laws of the Soviet state.</p>


<p>But what has happened to the soviets of which
Lenin speaks? There are <em>no soviets </em>in the Soviet
Union! The name remains, but in place of the living, acting
democracy of the soviets, we have a so-called parliament - a
caricature of a bourgeois parliament, because at least in a
bourgeois parliament different organisations, different
tendencies can put up. But in the so-called Soviet parliament we
have what amounts to a Reichstag - one totalitarian organisation,
where only a single candidate is put up, or as Marx would
explain, a plebiscital regime and not at all a workers' democracy
as existed with the soviets in the early days of the Soviet
Union.</p>


<p>Far from the right of recall which Lenin spoke
of, the system had degenerated to the extent that when Stalin
carried through his purge in 1936-9, about one-fifth to
two-fifths of the members of the parliament were arrested, exiled
to Siberia and shot, and mysteriously, without any new elections
or by-elections, new MPs appeared to take their place. Under the
rule of Stalin, in the last election in which Stalin took part,
in his own constituency, he received the magnificent total of 105
per cent of the votes. And that in itself is sufficient
indication of the kind of system we are dealing with as far as
democracy of any kind is concerned.</p>


<p>All this was no accident. Again, whose interest
is reflected? The law that no official should receive a higher
wage than a skilled worker was abolished by Stalin as long ago as
1931 and today the difference in wages between a parliamentary
representative or the President of the Soviet Union, and an
ordinary worker in the Soviet Union, is far far greater than the
difference in wages between the parliamentarians at Westminster
and the working class in Britain. Lenin had made a concession in
the early days of the revolution because they had no other
alternative; he had made the concession of allowing a difference
in wage of a maximum in the Soviet state of four to one. A
specialist, a technician, could receive four times the wage of a
skilled worker. That was the absolute maximum. That long ago has
been abolished and in the Soviet Union today the difference
between the top strata of the managers and the workers, is as
great and in many cases, even much greater, than in America,
Germany, Britain and other capitalist countries.</p>


<p>Whereas Lenin had openly proclaimed even the
difference of four to one as a <em>capitalist differential</em>, now
the bureaucracy which seized control reigns untramelled and uses
the Soviet state not in the interests of the working people, but
in the interests of the bureaucracy itself.</p>


<p>What has happened to the demand of Lenin for
the dissolution of the army into the armed people? It is now
nearly 50 years since the revolution. As late as 1931, an army
general was court-martialled because a peasant, seeing that his<em>
felinki </em>or big top boots were dirty and having a liking for
this general, had polished his boots. This was considered
degrading in a workers' army. Under Stalin, as the economy went
forward, so the differences appeared and grew. Whereas in the
early days of the Soviet state and even in the early years of the
Stalinist regime the soldiers and officers mingled as equals
after work (when off duty), now the officers have special clubs,
special barbers, special batmen, special everything, in addition
to the fact that the difference in wages between a private and an
officer, is greater than in the armies of the capitalist
countries.</p>


<p>Whereas Lenin had spoken of the armed people,
now we have the position of an armed elite that has been created
and conditioned <em>apart </em>from the people. The reason why an
army separate and apart from the people has to exist under
capitalism has been explained many times by Marx and by Lenin as
being for the defence of privilege and inequality and not at all
for the defence of the rights of people. So that condition laid
down by Lenin for a workers' state, of the ending of the monopoly
of arms in the hands of an elite and having instead an armed
people, has disappeared.</p>


<p>What has happened to the last point that was
raised by Lenin - that is, of not having any permanent
bureaucracy? Lenin had conceived that as the workers' state
gradually moved forward, more and more of the tasks of
administration, more and more of the tasks of the state, would be
carried out by the working class themselves. As they moved toward
socialism, and toward communism, the state would dissolve into
the people. On the contrary, under the rule of Stalin, we have
had a constant re-enforcement of the state machine and more
bureaucratisation, oppressing the working class in the Soviet
Union.</p>


<p>What then is left of the revolution? Why, then,
do the Trotskyists still maintain that the Soviet Union remains a
workers' state, albeit a Bonapartist workers' state or a deformed
workers' state?</p>


<p>The answer is that so long as the nationalised
economy, and the plan, continue to exist, then the Soviet Union
is a workers' state, entirely distinct from the states (of
greater or lesser democracy, as the case may be) where private
property and the unplanned domination of the market continue to
exist.</p>


<p>In the Soviet Union the planned nationalised
economy is the last, and only, conquest of the revolution that
remains.</p>


<p>Why, then, did these developments take place?
Why was Stalin victorious? The answer is that socialism cannot be
built in a single country, more particularly in a single backward
country. The reason for the victory of the bureaucracy in the
Soviet Union lies in the <em>material conditions </em>in the Soviet
Union itself at the time. Marx almost a hundred years before had
explained that in order to have communism, the material
conditions must exist, and these do not exist in the Soviet
Union.</p>


<p>Let us examine Lenin's writings. We will see
for example how in 1919, at the time of the seizure of power by
the workers in Germany, in the provinces of Bavaria and Saxony,
in his letter to the German workers dealing with this problem,
Lenin said the first act of the government must be to introduce
the seven-hour day. This was not so much because it was a reform
- of course Lenin and ourselves would be in favour of such
reforms - but because the extra hour a day which would be given
to the working class would give them time to take part in the
administration of the state industry, because that was how Lenin
saw the question of workers' power and socialism.</p>


<p>But that was not possible, at the stage with
which we are dealing, in an isolated, backward, peasant and
largely illiterate Soviet Union.</p>


<p>It is true that the Soviet Union has made
enormous strides, on the basis of state ownership and a plan, in
spite of the mistakes and the crimes of this monstrous
bureaucracy.</p>


<p>The Soviet Union has become the second most
powerful industrial state in the world. But dialectically, the
fact that industry has developed to a stage where the working
class, from being a tiny minority, is now by far and away the
majority of the people in the Soviet Union, where the working
class is perhaps the most highly cultured and educated in the
world, means that the bureaucracy, having taken power, is not
prepared to give it up. This bureaucracy will have to be
overthrown before we can have a restoration, not of socialism -
and here, may we say Comrade Clifford is apparently under the
illusion that socialism was mysteriously established in the
Soviet Union at a time when the material level in the Soviet
Union was not one third of that of the United States and of the
capitalist countries - but of workers' democracy on the level
that existed in the days of Lenin and Trotsky.</p>


<p>Trotsky has spoken of the 'betrayal' of the
revolution and these facts that we have here adduced are an
indication of this betrayal. Stalin was compelled, in order to
make certain of the victory of his bureaucracy, to carry through
the counter-revolution to the end; to purge the Soviet state of
nearly all those who had created the state - to murder two-thirds
of the Central Committee, not only those who had supported
Trotsky, but also those who had supported Stalin; to murder the
heads of the Red Army.<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">(3)</a></sup> The leading marshalls of the Soviet Union; Yakir,
Gamarnik, Tukhachevsky (the latter developed the idea of mobile
or lightning war later used by Hitler) were all wiped out. A
whole generation of marshalls, generals, officers, and cadres -
in fact, 70 per cent of all officers - were liquidated. The
disastrous results of this we will deal with later.</p>


<p>Stalin was forced to destroy all the elements
who still rested on the October revolution of 1917. At the time
that he took power, he unfortunately probably did not understand
the role that he was later to play. Stalin really believed that
he represented the interests of the revolution in the Soviet
Union and in the other countries. At the time of Lenin's funeral
he declared how the party and the leadership were going to remain
faithful to the ideals of the Communist International and
international socialism.</p>


<p>Stalin did not understand that in developing
the policy he did develop, more and more he would become a
prisoner, a tool and an agent of the bureaucracy itself. He
foresaw nothing, and understood nothing. As Trotsky expressed it:
if one could have taken a picture in 1923 and shown Stalin what
would happen as a consequence of his policy, even Stalin would
not have taken control. He would have refused to operate along
the lines he did. And to see how the fate of the Soviet Union as
it is today, as it was in 1917, as it will be in the coming years
and decades, is bound up with the fate of the international
working class, as the fate of all sectors of the revolution are
bound together, we can see how the policies of this criminal and
irresponsible bureaucracy led to the victory of Hitler in 1933.</p>


<p>In 1925-7, in China, and in 1924-6 Britain,
Stalin had the aim - because he had lost confidence in the
international revolution - of trying to placate the bourgeoisie
in China, and the petty bourgeois democrats of the Labour Party
and of the trade union bureaucracy in England. As a consequence,
he burned his fingers on this policy, and reversed policy
completely. Whereas in the Soviet Union the bureaucracy had based
themselves on the kulaks and the Nepmen growing into socialism,
after the repulsion of the revolution in 1927, Stalin was in a
panic, because of fear of the restoration of capitalism. Because
of fear of counter-revolution, the bureaucracy was compelled in a
caricatured form to adopt the policy of Trotsky, in relation at
least to the industrialisation of the Soviet Union and the
collectivisation of agriculture. But as always with the
bureaucracy, from one extreme they went to the other; from
denying the need for collectivisation in the villages, they now
passed to the insane policy of forced collectivisation. Similarly
in relation to industry: having declared that they could go ahead
at six per cent to nine per cent a year, they now declared that
anything was possible.</p>


<p>And then, along with the ultra-left turn in the
Soviet Union we had an ultra-left turn in the capitalist
countries. So far as the 'social-fascist' period of Stalin and
Stalinism is concerned: in Britain there was the ludicrous
position of the Communist Party not only not uniting with the
petit bourgeoisie - as Clifford now suggests must be done in
Ireland - but refusing to unite with the working class leaders of
the labour movement, with those in whom the working class
unfortunately had confidence at that time.</p>


<p>We had the infamous Stalinist formula that
'social democracy and fascism are not antipodes but twins'! To
which Trotsky made the famous reply that 'twins are born at the
same time' - that social democracy is at its strongest when the
rate of profit is high, when capitalism is booming and the labour
and trade union bureaucracy can get concessions for the workers
from the capitalist class. He stressed that fascism, far from
being the 'twin' of social democracy as the 'genius' Stalin
declared it to be, arises as a defence of the bourgeoisie when
crisis sets in, when there are no profits and when no concessions
can be made. Then the capitalist Black Hundreds, or brownshirts
or what you like to call them, go to work to split and terrorise
the workers, who are in process of turning from the reformism of
the social-democratic bureaucracy and of taking the revolutionary
road.</p>


<p>In Britain the result of this criminal policy
dictated by the Stalinist bureaucracy, was that the tiny British
Communist Party was breaking up Labour Party meetings, trying to
beat up Labour leaders - Pollitt, Campbell and other hacks and
mouthpieces announced in the <em>Worker </em>that the Labour Party <em>was
not to be allowed to hold any meetings in the open anywhere in
the country. </em>And, of course, as a consequence of this, the
Communist Party became isolated from the workers who were
completely indignant at the ultra-left and insane tactics of that
party.</p>


<p>But in Britain it was merely comedy. In Germany
on the other hand, <em>the policy of Stalin was absolutely tragic
- a monstrous betrayal of the working class. </em>The failure of
the working class to give a lead to the petit bourgeoisie - and
that, Comrade Clifford, is where the problem of the petit
bourgeoisie comes in; where the working class fails to give a
lead, then the petit bourgeoisie goes over to the side of
reaction - the failure of the revolution of 1918, the failure of
the revolutionary opportunity of 1923, this led to the petit
bourgeoisie moving in the direction of the counter-revolution, of
fascism. In 1930 for the first time Hitler secured six million
votes at the polls, and instead of the Communist Party
immediately offering a united front to the Social Democrats and
preparing for a struggle to the death against Hitler and the Nazi
gangsters, the Communist Party refused. They even attempted to
compete in the most base fashion with the nationalist propaganda
of the Nazis. They split the German workers in the most insane
fashion possible. For example, in the period 1930-3 they even
came out with the slogan 'Beat the little <em>Zoergebiels </em>in
the playgrounds!' - inciting the children of Communist workers
against the children of Social Democratic workers (Zoergebiel
being the Prussian chief of police, who was a Social Democrat).</p>


<p>In this criminal way Stalinism paralysed the
German working class. In 1931 in Prussia, the state in which the
Social Democrats held power, the Communist Party even united and
voted with the Nazis in the so-called Red Referendum, for the
purpose of turning out the Social Democratic government.</p>


<p>The Communist Party at that time was putting
forward the demagogic nonsense that because capitalism ruled
under fascism and because capitalism ruled under democracy,
therefore fascism and democracy were one and the same thing. What
did it matter, ran the propaganda of Thaelmann, whether one gets
bullets from the fascists or bullets from the so-called
democrats? Whether one starves under the Social Democrats or
whether one starves under Hitler? In this way they paralysed the
working class. They refused to unite the working class. They
refused to organise the working class on a programme that could
have won also the mass of the middle class who had gone mad and
in their agony, due to the slump of 1929-33, had turned to the
fascists for a solution.</p>


<p>For the first time in the history of the
working class in the period of a century, monstrous totalitarian
reaction was allowed to take power, and to crush the working
class, as Hitler boasted, 'without a window-pane being broken'.</p>


<p>We should remember in this connection that
whereas Stalin was preaching the insane theory of
'social-fascism' - that the Social Democrats were the worst form
of fascists - Trotsky wrote four books warning that the victory
of Hitler would be a blow not only against the German working
class but against the international working class, warning that
the victory of Hitler <em>would mean war on the Soviet Union. </em>At
that time the so-called 'communists' were attacking Trotsky as a
'counter-revolutionary' for putting forward the conception of the
united front of the working class, a united front of struggle on
the basis of the working class.</p>


<p>Trotsky appealed to the German workers and more
especially to the communist workers, not to go down without a
fight. A defeat of the German workers, he said, at the hands of
Hitler, would be worse than a hundred other defeats. Comrade
Clifford says there was no Communist Party to speak of in
Germany; that there was no possibility of any effective armed
resistance. Yet we know there were over one million armed
communist workers, Comrade Clifford, and two million armed
workers in the Republican Guard. There were even some tanks from
the Spartacist uprising. Of course, we realise that for Comrade
Clifford to recognise these facts would mean that he might have
to look more closely and in a Marxist manner at the 'theory' of
'social-fascism'.</p>


<p>In Britain - as we could give scores of
quotations to indicate - in Germany, everywhere, Trotsky revealed
himself as a 'counter-revolutionary' according to the Communist
Party, because he was proposing and demanding a united front
between the social democracy and the Communist Party in order to
prevent the coming to power of the fascists.</p>


<p>This was one of Stalin's greatest crimes and
greatest betrayals. In the current (August 1965) issue of <em>Marxism
Today</em>, in a most dishonest and ignorant way, the issue is not
dealt with at all as it was in reality. It was not a question of
a defence of bourgeois democracy, but of a defence of the rights
of the working class, of the elements of a new workers' state
that exist within democracy - of the rights of the trade unions,
the rights of workers' parties, which are concessions that had
been wrested from capitalism over a period of a hundred years.</p>


<p>It was this 'great teacher' of the workers,
Joseph Stalin, who was entirely responsible for the victory of
Hitler; no Stalin - no Hitler! That should be ingrained on the
working class.</p>


<p>Here we might point out that up to 1933 the
supporters of Trotsky considered themselves as part of the
Communist International, and stood for reform within the Soviet
Union and within the Communist Parties. But after 1933, the
Communist Parties showed that they had learned nothing from this
greatest defeat in the history of the working class, and
continued with the same policy as in the past. In France, as late
as 1934 when an attempt was being organised at a fascist coup (we
would refer you here to <em>France in Crisis</em>
<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-4" name="doc-4">(4)</a></sup>) the
Communist Party, having learned nothing from the terrible
experience of the German workers, united with the fascists for
the overthrow of the bourgeois parliament in February 1934. It
was only the instinct of the working class, who had seen what had
happened in Germany, that led them to come out in a general
strike, and prevent the move to power of the fascists.</p>


<p>It was the continuing reactionary policies
dictated by the bureaucracy, which saw a mortal danger to its
position in the revolutionary coming to power of the workers
anywhere in Europe, that forced Trotsky and the Left Opposition
to break and establish the Fourth International.</p>


<p>Stalin attempted to arrive at an agreement with
Hitler at that time. For him, the victory of Hitler was only an
episode, not a terrible defeat. He was busy building so-called
'socialism in one country'; in reality, building the interests of
his bureaucratic clique. It was only in 1935, again by the
dictate of Stalin, that the Communist Party once again changed
its line, and instead of the united front which they had rejected
in the past, turned 180 degrees, and came forward with the
people's front or popular front. And the idea of a popular front
was again dictated purely by the foreign diplomatic needs and
interests, not of the Soviet Union, or the Russian or the
international working class, but of this gangster caste which had
seized control in the Soviet Union.</p>


<p>Stalin was prepared to sacrifice - and this
meant in the end the sacrifice of the interests of the Soviet
Union - the French workers, the workers of Spain, the working
class of Britain and of other countries (including Ireland, for
we have not forgotten what happened to the Irish Communist Party)
- when it became clear that Hitler intended war on the Soviet
Union. In order to try to come to some kind of military agreement
with the so-called democratic capitalists of France and Britain,
against Hitler, Stalin followed a policy of popular frontism.</p>


<p>Yet we know that the so-called democratic
powers backed Hitler to the hilt; they supported Hitler because
they wanted to see the crushing of the German working class. The
British imperialists in particular supported the taking over of
the Rhineland in order to break the power of France, and above
all in older to prepare Hitler as a weapon of intervention
against the Soviet Union. And if the war and the developments
that took place later were not in the interest of British
imperialism, it was no thanks to the criminal policy of Stalin
and the Stalinists, as we will show later.</p>


<p>But now that this bureaucratic caste had seized
complete control in the Soviet Union and had purged the working
class, the whole rosy perspective was spoiled by the outbreak of
the revolution in Spain. And now for two reasons the bureaucracy
was scared out of its wits by the revolution in Spain. First of
all, from the so-called diplomatic point of view, that it might
frighten its would-be allies into the arms of the reaction.
Secondly, a victory for the working class, an installation of
workers' democracy anywhere in the world, would mean the end of
this bureaucratic caste itself in the Soviet Union. The victory
of the workers and the establishment of a state on the lines
outlined by Marx and Lenin would immediately have led to the
Russian workers, seeing they were no longer isolated, settling
accounts with this monstrous tumour which had grown on the Soviet
state - they would have lanced it with the weapon of political
revolution. </p>


<p>As reports indicate, even from bourgeois
observers, it was the revolution in Spain which shook the basis
of Stalin's rule and which now led to the consummation of the
bureaucratic counter-revolution in the Soviet Union. It was then
that Stalin organised his purge trials. It was then that Stalin
massacred hundreds of thousands of worker-Bolsheviks. It was then
that Stalin exiled to Siberia and into slave labour camps,
between ten and fifteen million people. All this because of the
fear of revolution on the part of the proletariat.</p>


<p>The crimes of Stalin were not an accident, as
Khruschev and others made out, although to Comrade Clifford this
counter-revolutionary bureaucratic ruthlessness was 'necessary'
to the maintenance of the 'dictatorship of the proletariat'.
Another particular favourite of Comrade Clifford, apart from the
monster Stalin, is Mao Tse-Tung. The latter also, strangely
enough for a 'Marxist', thinks the crimes of Stalin were
accidental, and that the so-called 'cult of the personality' was
only a question of a mistake. It is absolutely an insult to the
intelligence even of non-Marxists to speak as if one man could
dominate a whole country, and embark on a programme of crimes of
that sort, without being the representative of the material
interests of some powerful stratum or strata of society; in this
case, the bureaucracy.</p>


<p>The cult of personality was launched, the
terror was launched, against the working class in the Soviet
Union, against the October revolution, out of fear of the
throwing aside of the usurpers of the revolution and the
restoration of democracy on the lines of the October revolution.
That is the explanation of the crimes of Stalin. And in the
lunatic lengths to which this insane bureaucracy proceeded we had
at various stages whole nations being uprooted and exiled to
Siberia, as Khruschev was later to reveal - the Chechen Ingushes,
the Crimean Tartars, the German Volga Republic, all these entire
peoples, men, women, and children exiled into Siberia. What did
all this have to do with socialism, Comrade Clifford? What did it
have to do with the dictatorship of the proletariat, never mind
socialism?</p>


<p>It was not for nothing that Lenin in the period
of 1923-4, as the new documents have now revealed, was already
beginning to take action against Stalin for his Great Russian
chauvinism and his attitude to the backward and minority peoples
(including the Georgian people) of the Soviet Union. Lenin
explained that Stalin did not understand the ABC of the problem
of nationalities - and incidentally, we might mention just in
passing that the book on nationalities published by Stalin was
merely a paraphrase of the ideas of Lenin, which Lenin went over
many times before it was published.</p>


<p>As with all his other policies, Stalin's crimes
in regard to the nationalities had nothing in common either with
the programme of Bolshevism, or the means with which they won the
peoples in the Soviet Union in the period of the war of
intervention and the civil war.</p>


<h4>The Hitler-Stalin Pact</h4>

<p>The Stalinists came out for the 'popular
front'. In the most cynical fashion which it is possible to
imagine - having betrayed the revolution in Germany, the
revolution in France (the French workers also had the opportunity
of seizing power), the revolution in Spain - Stalin made the
second world war inevitable. For five years, having put forward
the programme of popular frontism, of agreement with democracy -
using the Communist International as a tool of the foreign policy
of the Russian bureaucracy - Stalin then cynically turned around
and signed the Hitler-Stalin Pact, a pact that Trotsky predicted
would result in war on the Soviet Union. This pact was a
preparation for the intervention of Hitler.</p>


<p>Trotskyism, while all during this period and at
each stage making a relentless criticism of the crimes and
betrayals of Stalinism, nevertheless always stood for the defence
of what was left of the October revolution.</p>


<p>Stalin, by operating this policy of popular
frontism, prepared the way for Hitler's victory. The French
working class was demoralised; and as a consequence we had the
victory of Hitler in the West, which in turn prepared the way for
war on the East. Many people have believed (and Comrade Clifford
still does) that it was Stalin's 'clever policy' which led to the
situation where the ruling class of Britain and of America were
prepared to make an alliance with the Soviet Union against
Germany. This is absolute nonsense.</p>


<p>Even in 1917 at the time of the seizure of
power by the Bolsheviks the imperialists of Britain and France
were quite prepared to support the Soviet Union - temporarily of
course - against Germany, their main enemy and main danger to
their interests at that time. And in the same way, 'supporting
the Soviet Union' - in Lenin's phrase, 'like the rope supports a
hanged man' - they were quite prepared to come to an alliance
with the Soviet Union at a later stage again because of Hitler's
conquest of the greater part of Europe.</p>


<p>In the second world war, we get an entirely
different way of operating on the part of the Stalinists than
that which we had seen on the part of Lenin and Trotsky in the
period of the intervention against the Soviet Union following the
first world war.</p>


<p>At the time of the most desperate peril for the
Soviet Union, when the German army stood at the gates of Moscow,
Leningrad and Stalingrad, when Stalin asked for a second front,
he was told that it was militarily impossible, that the
resources, tanks, landing craft and men were not available. A
million [British] troops were in the Middle East (in Persia, Iraq
etc) and by sheer 'coincidence' were facing toward the richest
part of the Soviet Union (the Urals, Baku, Batum and the Soviet
oilfields). Again by sheer 'coincidence' there were a million
Russian troops facing the British troops. When Stalin in
desperation asked that these British troops should fight with the
Russians on the Eastern Front, Churchill replied that Stalin
should withdraw the million Russian troops from these frontiers
and send them to fight on the Eastern Front. He (Churchill) was
perfectly willing that the million British troops should garrison
Baku, the Caucasus, the Urals and the richest parts of the Soviet
Union. Even Stalin knew what that meant. He turned down the
generous offer of the great democratic gentleman.</p>


<p>What all this revealed was the calculations of
the ruling class - that at some stage the Soviet Union would be
destroyed and they would collect the lot.</p>


<p>Khruschev has revealed something of the crimes
of Stalin in regard to the conduct of the war. First of all they
were caught completely unprepared by Hitler's attack. In spite of
the fact that many warnings were given by the imperialists and by
workers and peasants on the frontiers who saw pontoons, etc,
being prepared, Stalin clung to his agreement with Hitler.</p>


<p>What is not generally realised is that at the
time of the attack by the German forces the fire power of the
Russian army was greater than the firepower of the German army;
and other things being equal, the Soviet Union should have
defeated the Germans within the first six months of the war. The
reason for the terrible victories of Hitler which cost the
Russian people so many millions of dead, and the Soviet Union
such terrible sacrifices, was the crime of Stalin in destroying
over 70 per cent of the effective officers and cadres of the
Russian army in order to maintain his totalitarian rule; and in
putting in their place such nonentities as Voroshilov, Budyenny
and Timoshenko.</p>


<p>The Russian armies were decapitated, and in
desperation Stalin had to release Zhukov and Russokovsky from the
jail for the purpose of conducting the war!</p>


<p>Instead of Lenin's internationalist policy, as
would be natural with a workers' state - relying on the working
class of other countries and above all on the German soldiers and
working class, to win them over to the revolution (as the
Russians had succeeded in doing in 1917-18) - Stalin waged the
struggle as a <em>nationalist </em>struggle, even as a <em>racial </em>struggle.</p>


<p>If one reads the poison disseminated by the
Communist Party, in Britain, France and other countries,
following the lead of Stalin, one will see and be shocked by
this. In Russia itself such slogans as 'Death to the Germans',
'The only good German is a dead German', 'To each a German', and
so on, were raised by the bureaucratic conductors of the
so-called 'Great Patriotic War'. This policy offering nothing but
retribution - not, mind you to the German fascists, the German
capitalists, the SA or the SS - but to the <em>German people as a
whole, </em>led to the war lasting much longer than it need have
done, and led to the imposition of immeasurably greater
sacrifices on the Russian people than would otherwise have been
necessary.</p>


<p>Just to point to what we have said, we would
add that Hitler <em>actually distributed and redistributed Russian
propaganda material to the German army, </em>because it aided
discipline in that it left no way out for the German soldiers
except nazi discipline. <em>Can anyone imagine the German High
Command helping with the circulation of Bolshevik propaganda in
the period 1917-18</em>?!! <em>That </em>was the difference between
Stalinist propaganda and Bolshevik propaganda.</p>


<p>Outside Moscow there were one million German
soldiers, not clad for the winter, without sufficient food, or
sometimes any at all - they died frozen in heaps. Not one
international call, not one call to them <em>as workers </em>was
made - not a single offer of a bowl of soup even. The bureaucracy
could only offer anti-Boche, anti-Hun racialism and hate.</p>


<p>We should remember that the second world war,
in the European arena at least, was a Russo-German war. British
and US imperialism <em>remained onlookers. </em>The only reason
they made the second front in 1944 was, not because they were
dear allies of the great warrior Stalin, but because of their
fear that if they did not intervene at that stage, when the
Russian army was marching on Berlin, they would find the Russians
on the English Channel. Their only reason for intervening was to
save capitalism in Europe, to prevent the occupation of the whole
of Europe by the Russian armies.</p>


<p>And here we can say in regard to the second
world war that it was not only the gigantic sacrifices and mighty
struggles of the Russian people themselves that saved the Soviet
Union from destruction after that war. Russia was at her weakest,
she had been bled white. She produced at that time eight million
tons of steel, all of which went into the production of
armaments. (Only a bare three or four per cent of Russian
equipment was Western aid, and this mainly in the form of food,
clothing, boots etc.) The armaments themselves were
Russian-produced, and here let us say that in the field of
armaments, the Russians outproduced Nazi Germany with the whole
of Europe at her disposal.</p>


<p>America alone was producing 120 million tons of
steel - that is, apart from Britain and the other capitalist
countries of the West. The American and the British troops who
were engaged in Europe were fresh, the overwhelming majority of
them had engaged in hardly any real fighting at all. Had it not
been for the revolutionary wave which swept Europe after the war
- the radicalisation of the British workers and the American
people who wanted the troops brought home once the war was over -
it would not have been possible for the Soviet Union to be saved.
America had the atomic bomb, the dropping of which, incidentally,
was approved and supported by Stalin and by his lackeys in
Britain and other countries. America was at her strongest, Russia
at her weakest, and still America was paralysed because it was
impossible to swing the American workers behind a war against the
Soviet Union. That is the reason why the Soviet Union was
victorious.</p>


<p>In this regard it can be said that the
salvation of the Soviet Union was not so much a result of the
reactionary policies of Stalin and alliances with imperialism. On
the contrary, the Soviet Union was saved <em>in spite of
these alliances and this policy.</em></p>


<h4>The Bureaucracy Today</h4>

<p>We have said that Stalin represented the
bureaucracy - not the working class, but the millions of
officialdom in the Soviet Union. From a Marxist point of view
this can easily be explained. Engels, in <em>Anti-D&uuml;hring</em>,
<sup><a href="../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/index.htm">[source]</a></sup>
has shown that the division into classes in society, in the last
analysis, is due to the division of labour.</p>


<p>Engels explained that so long as art, science
and government remain the preserve of a small group of people and
not the masses, this small group of people would use and abuse
their position in their own interest and not in the interest of
the people as a whole. He went on to explain that this was
inevitable as long as the masses of the people had to work seven,
eight, nine or ten hours a day for the barest necessities of
existence.</p>


<p>In Russia, at the time of the revolution, the
per capita income and standard of living were less than in
Britain three centuries ago. On the basis of weak industry,
backward agriculture, ignorance and illiteracy - where the
working class had to work long hours merely as Engels said, to
get the barest necessities of existence - it was not possible for
the working class to maintain itself in power. That is the
explanation for the victory of the Stalinist bureaucracy.</p>


<p>By the dialectic of history the very victories
of the Soviet Union in the last ten to fifteen years have
gradually been undermining the power of the bureaucracy within
the Soviet Union. The bureaucracy has ceased to function even as
a relatively progressive force. In the period between the wars,
given the failure of the international revolution (the reasons
for which have been mentioned) the bureaucracy played a
relatively progressive role in the industrialisation of the
Soviet Union.</p>


<p>But already by 1953, the bureaucracy, in
Marxist terms, had become an impediment, a fetter on the
development of the productive forces. Marx explained the role
which capitalism played in the past - the development of the
material conditions for socialism. We can say that developments
like those in the Soviet Union are possible in backward
countries, where capitalism might be destroyed by various means
(which we don't want to go into at this moment). Where, on the
other hand, the proletariat would take power in a country like
Britain, America, France or Japan, there is already a sufficiency
of the material development of production. But even so, as Marx
explained when he foreshadowed the revolution, it would require
the efforts of the Germans, the French and the English - of the
most advanced countries at that time - for the building of
socialism. So also in America, we can <em>begin </em>the
dictatorship of the proletariat. We cannot construct socialism
even in America on its own.</p>


<p>But today one cannot imagine the revolution in
America, Britain, France, or Germany without it spreading to
other countries of Europe and of the world.</p>


<p>In the period 1950-3 the bureaucracy, as with
the capitalist class in the last four or five decades, has become
more and more an impediment on the planning and development of
production. It is impossible to operate a so-called socialist
plan without the direct participation and control of the working
class, the peasants and the people as a whole. In the Soviet
Union the rule of the bureaucracy is increasingly hampering
development. According to Russian economists themselves,
one-third of the entire national effort is wasted because of the
corruption, mismanagement and nepotism of the bureaucracy.</p>


<p>In 1953, as in 1936, Stalin, feeling the ground
once again moving under his feet, was preparing another purge.
That is the explanation of the so-called 'Doctors' Plot'<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-5" name="doc-5">(5)</a></sup> of
that time. But the bureaucracy decided that Russia could not
afford a new purge - the terrible purge of 1936-40 had terribly
weakened the Soviet Union. We have already dealt, albeit briefly,
with the terrible effect of that purge on the armed forces, and
the consequences of this in the war. The whole of the country was
paralysed by the purge which was waged by Stalin at that time. It
was a virtual civil war.</p>


<p>Stalin prepared a new purge in 1953, which
would also have meant the purge of the top bureaucrats -
Khruschev, Voroshilov<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-6" name="doc-6">(6)</a></sup>, Zhukov, Beria and others. They decided to strangle
Stalin. And Stalin probably got his just deserts, strangled by
his own bureaucrats and policemen, in 1953.</p>


<p>In the intervening period, since 1953, the
Stalinist bureaucracy, headed by Khruschev, adopted a new policy.
They realised that it was impossible, without plunging the Soviet
Union into complete chaos, to launch into a new purge, which
would have affected tens of millions of people. The Soviet Union,
in the world situation which existed, did not dare face a
prospect of that sort. In addition to which, the Russian working
class was far stronger than before, and the bureaucracy was not
prepared to risk a tremendous clash. The significance of Malenkov,<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-7" name="doc-7">(7)</a></sup>
Khruschev, Kosygin and Co, is that that they have stood for <em>a
policy of reform from the top in order to prevent revolution
from the bottom. </em>The whole policy of the bureaucracy in the
Soviet Union is orientated to a defence of their privileges
against the working class and to try by various reforms and
concessions to prevent the working class from overthrowing them.</p>


<p>Trotsky, in predicting the <em>political
revolution </em>in the Soviet Union, had indicated the way in
which the demands of the working class for a restoration of
soviet democracy would proceed. In the Hungarian revolution in
1956 there were Hungarian workers who had never read Trotsky, but
had read Lenin. They nevertheless put forward exactly the demands
which Trotsky had worked out. This was no accident. The demands
which they put forward were for the four conditions we have
mentioned earlier. They demanded, in addition, the right of all
parties which accept state ownership and a plan to put forward
their positions. Never again were the Hungarian workers prepared
to tolerate the totalitarian dictatorship of any one party.</p>


<p>Whereas it could be argued that in the early
days of the Russian revolution, the Bolsheviks were forced to
adopt a repressive regime, now, at a time when the Soviet Union
can produce 91 million tons of steel, when capitalism has been
weakened throughout the world, when the bureaucrats allege that
socialism has been realised in the Soviet Union, not even the
elementary principles of the dictatorship of the proletariat as
worked out by Lenin and Marx exist in the Soviet Union.</p>


<p>Why is it that the bureaucracy cannot introduce
democracy? Why is it that they cannot allow workers'
organisations the freedom to exist? Let us look at the bourgeois
revolution. In the early stages of such revolutions, as under
Cromwell for example, the bourgeoisie was compelled to take
dictatorial measures against feudal reaction. But at a later
stage, after the bourgeois had established themselves, they had
no objection to reaction putting forward the programme of a
return to the 'good old days' - back to feudalism in effect -
because the idea was ludicrous and reactionary. Yet in the Soviet
Union, at a time when there are sixty million workers, when only
democracy can really permit the full development of the potential
of the Soviet state, the bureaucracy still continues with its
totalitarian measures. And measures against who? The bourgeoisie
has long since ceased to exist. The peasantry is supposed to be,
according to our friend Clifford, the dearest ally of the
proletariat (and we would certainly say that the peasants would
not want to go back to the old system if they were offered an
alternative by the working class of the Soviet Union). The
measures of the bureaucracy are directed <em>against the workers, </em>as
more and more they realise that they, the bureaucracy, are an
impediment upon production.</p>


<p>The reason why the bureaucracy is now compelled
to fool around with capitalist 'incentives', to give the managers
an incentive in the production of their factories, is precisely
because they are completely incapable of appealing to the masses
themselves. To do this would mean destroying the privileges of
the bureaucracy. This is the problem from which stem the zigzags
of the bureaucracy over the past ten to fifteen years, under
Stalin, under Malenkov, under Khruschev and now Brezhnev and
Kosygin.</p>


<p>The bureaucracy first of all <em>centralised </em>the
enterprises - 500,000 of them, run by a handful of people - which
[was an absolutely crazy idea]. Khruschev decentralised and, as
the Trotskyists at the time said would happen, from one
centralised bureaucracy controlling industry, sixteen
bureaucracies appeared and proliferated, laying new burdens of
chaos, red tape and difficulties before the Russian economy. The
original impetus given to industry by the regionalisation turned
into its opposite. Now they are recentralising and at the same
time trying to decentralise! The one thing they cannot do, and
which the material base has been created for now, is to permit
the creative intervention of the masses, because that would mean
the end of their privileges and power. That is the one reason why
- unlike the bourgeoisie, whose system was based on private
ownership, and who could allow the development of democracy - the
Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union cannot allow any form
of democracy. It is impossible, for that matter in China or in
any other of the deformed workers' states.</p>


<p>Comrade Clifford has mixed up (consciously or
unconsciously) two fundamentally different questions: the Theory
of the Permanent Revolution and the dictatorship of the
proletariat. We have defined the dictatorship of the proletariat,
what it means and how it works.</p>


<p>We will now take up the Theory of the Permanent
Revolution. Very simply, the theory can be explained in this way.
In the period of the modern development of capitalism there is,
first of all, what Trotsky calls the law of combined development:
superimposed on feudal or semi-feudal remains, we have the
development of modern industry - as we had in Russia, to a
certain extent in China and in other countries of the so-called
underdeveloped or backward areas of the world. Because of the
period in which we live, the bourgeoisie in the backward
countries is incapable of playing the role that was played by the
bourgeoisie in the revolutions of the past, for example in the
English revolution or the great French revolution of 1789.
Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution bases itself on the idea
of Marx - and this they held in common with Lenin - that under
modern conditions <em>the bourgeoisie is quite incapable of
carrying through the bourgeois democratic revolution. </em>The
reason for this is the linking up of the interests of the
landowners with the bourgeoisie, and in the colonial countries
the linking up of both of these together with imperialism.
Therefore, <em>the problem was posed of a new class coming on the
scene and carrying through the programme of the bourgeois
democratic revolution.</em></p>


<p>To understand this clearly we can take the
development of the Russian revolution itself. What were the
various positions and conceptions in relation to the revolution?
The Mensheviks, echoing Plekhanov in this regard, said that we
are facing a bourgeois revolution in Russia, therefore we must
make an agreement with the liberal bourgeoisie. We will come to
an agreement with the liberal bourgeoisie, they argued, Tsarism
will be overthrown, then over a period of decades democracy will
be developed in Russia and <em>then </em>will come the question of
the socialist revolution.</p>


<p>The Menshevik spokesman Martynov<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-8" name="doc-8">(8)</a></sup> wrote
on the eve of the 1905 revolution:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The coming revolution will be a
revolution of the bourgeoisie; and that means that...it will
only, to a greater or lesser extent, secure the rule of all or
some of the bourgeois classes. If this is so, it is clear that
the coming revolution can on no account assume political forms
against the will of the whole of the bourgeoisie, as the latter
will be the master of tomorrow. If so, then to follow the path of
simply frightening the majority of the bourgeois elements would
mean that the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat could
lead only to one result - the restoration of absolutism in its
original form...&quot; (A Martynov, <em>Die Dikatury, </em>Geneva,
1905, pages 57-8)</p>


<p>Martynov's implied conclusion is that the
working class should impose self-restraint on itself so as not to
'frighten' the bourgeoisie; but at the same time he states that
it should persistently press the bourgeoisie to lead the
revolution:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The struggle to influence the course and
outcome of the bourgeois revolution can be expressed simply in
the proletariat's exerting revolutionary pressure on the will of
the liberal and radical bourgeoisie, the more democratic 'lower'
section of society compelling the 'higher' section to agree to
lead the bourgeois revolution to its conclusion.&quot;</p>


<p>Similarly, the Menshevik paper <em>Iskra</em><sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-9" name="doc-9">(9)</a></sup> wrote
at the time:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;When looking at the arena of struggle in
Russia, what do we see? Only two powers: Tsarist autocracy and
the liberal bourgeoisie, the latter organised and of tremendous
specific weight. The working classes are split and can do
nothing; as an independent force we do not exist, and therefore
our task consists in the support of the second force -the liberal
bourgeoisie; we must encourage it, and on no account frighten it
by putting forward the independent demands of the
proletariat.&quot; (Quoted by G Zinoviev, <em>Istoriia Rossiiskei
Kommunisticheskoii Partii (Bolshevikov)</em> <span class="inote">[History of the Bolshevik Party]</span>, Moscow-Leningrad, 1923, page 158)</p>


<h4>Lenin's Position</h4>

<p>Lenin's position was somewhat different to
this. Lenin took the position that they were facing a bourgeois
democratic revolution. But, he said, echoing the words of Marx,
the further East one goes, the more corrupt, the more rotten, the
more venal is the bourgeoisie and the more incapable it is of
playing a progressive role. We are facing a bourgeois revolution,
he said, in agreement with the Mensheviks, <em>therefore some of
our main blows must be struck against the bourgeoisie itself; we
must have absolutely no confidence in, we must give absolutely no
support whatsoever to the liberal bourgeoisie. </em>Lenin put
forward the idea of an alliance of the proletariat and the
peasantry, of the 'democratic dictatorship of the workers and
peasants'.</p>


<p>He said that the bourgeoisie was linked to
Tsarism, and to the landowners; and that therefore <em>we would
have to have in the early stages a bourgeois democratic
dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry.</em></p>


<p>Lenin and the Bolsheviks said that the
revolution would be bourgeois in character and that its aim would
not overstep the limits of a bourgeois revolution. &quot;The
democratic revolution will not extend beyond the scope of
bourgeois social-economic relationships...&quot;
<sup><a href="../../lenin/works/1905/tactics/ch06.htm">[source]</a></sup>
wrote Lenin. And again, &quot;...this democratic revolution will not weaken, but
will strengthen the domination of the bourgeoisie.&quot;
<sup><a href="../../lenin/works/1905/tactics/ch01.htm">[source]</a></sup>
He returned to the theme again and again.</p>


<p>Lenin accentuated and emphasised that the
democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry was
to be a bourgeois dictatorship. And on the basis of the bourgeois
revolution - and here we see the internationalism of Lenin -
Russia <em>would provoke the socialist revolution in Europe and
then on the basis of the socialist revolution in Europe, the
socialist revolution would be carried to Russia and we would have
a proletarian revolution in Russia.</em></p>


<p>One can see this point in all of Lenin's
writings and pamphlets up to 1917 and Lenin always emphasised
this point.</p>


<h4>Trotsky's Conception</h4>

<p>What was wrong with the conception of Lenin, as
Trotsky would express it, was that he put forward an <em>algebraic
formula, </em>leaving history and the actual course of development
to fill in the unknown. Trotsky said that if you have a
dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry, the question
arises: which is to be the dominant force? If there is to be a
dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry, then it is obvious
that the <em>proletariat has to be the dominant force </em>and get
the support of the peasantry by supporting the aims of the
peasantry.</p>


<p>As Trotsky pointed out, all history has
demonstrated that the peasants, and the petit bourgeoisie in the
towns, can play no independent role as a class. Under modern
conditions they support the bourgeoisie or they support the
proletariat. Marx explained this many times. Lenin explained it.
Trotsky explained it. The only people who never understood this
were Stalin, Mao Tse-Tung and their hangers-on or would-be
hangers-on.</p>


<p>Trotsky's theory put the issue in a different
way to Lenin. He agreed with Lenin as against the Mensheviks, and
quoted many figures to support this view, showing how the
landlords were linked with the banks, how the banks were linked
with the bourgeoisie, how the bourgeoisie was linked with the
landlords. The bourgeoisie had investments in the land; the
landlords had investments in industry. Both were linked to
Tsarism. Therefore, the bourgeoisie, because of these links,
because of the belated character of the revolution and because of
the links with foreign capital, could not carry through the
bourgeois democratic revolution.</p>


<p>Therefore, Trotsky said, the revolution would <em>begin
</em>as a bourgeois revolution, with democratic slogans, with the
slogan of the eight hour day, with the slogan of the land to the
peasants and so on. Where he differed with Lenin on this
question, was in that he said that because the bourgeoisie was
incapable of carrying through the bourgeois democratic
revolution, <em>the proletariat would have to come to power in
Russia in order to carry through the tasks of the bourgeois
democratic revolution. </em>And how, in a bourgeois democratic
revolution, could they come to power without the support of the
peasantry, without the support of the petit bourgeoisie? The idea
is absolute nonsense.</p>


<p>But, Trotsky said, the proletariat, having come
to power and having carried through the bourgeois democratic
tasks (having overthrown the monarchy, given land to the
peasants, unified Russia, given freedom to the oppressed
nationalities, and so on) would not stop at this; but having
obtained power through the bourgeois democratic revolution, in
order to carry through the bourgeois democratic revolution, would
then go on to the socialist tasks of the revolution. Having
carried through the socialist revolution - and obviously Russia
could not carry it through on its own - the revolution would then
expand to the countries of the West.</p>


<p>This is what is meant by the Permanent
Revolution - that beginning as a bourgeois revolution, it becomes
a socialist revolution Having become a socialist revolution in
one country it then expands to other countries. In other words, <em>the
revolution assumes a permanent character.</em></p>


<p>Let us make clear that as far as Lenin, Trotsky
and all the Marxists at that time were concerned, the question of
socialism in one country could not be raised. It could not have
been raised by Stalin, Plekhanov or anyone else because it was
such a reactionary idea. That was not at all the difference
between Lenin and Trotsky before the revolution. It was as to
whether the bourgeois revolution could become a proletarian
revolution; and on this question Lenin had not taken up a firm
position before 1917.</p>


<h4>'Socialism in one country' meant revolution in one country</h4>

<p>It will be clear from what has been said that
today, fifty years after the revolution of 1917, the tasks and
problems in Russia have not yet been solved. Because the
revolution took place only in one country, inevitably it
degenerated into a bureaucratic or deformed workers' state (this
was Lenin's description of it in 1923). Bureaucratisation in turn
fed upon the continuing isolation. Then, through control of the
Comintern, the bureaucracy, under Stalin, became an active and
openly counter-revolutionary agent in the communist workers'
movement internationally, Because of all this, the task of moving
towards socialism still remains in the Soviet Union. The working
class in the Soviet Union will have to pay with a new revolution,
a political revolution, because of the fact that the revolution
remained isolated and therefore degenerated.</p>


<p>Even though Russia has become the second
industrial power of the world, it is quite clear that it has not
succeeded in solving its problems, and events since the second
world war have demonstrated this over and over again. Even if one
assumes that in the next five years - and this is entirely
possible - the Soviet Union should succeed in overtaking and
exceeding the production of America, still they would not have
solved the problems that exist. First and foremost, there is the
problem of the bureaucracy, which is now clogging up all the
creative power of the Soviet Union. Secondly, if one assumes that
in the class struggle which is still taking place relentlessly in
all the countries of the world, in the advanced countries as well
as the backward countries, that the working class were to be
defeated, then the fate of the Soviet Union, as formerly, or even
more than formerly, will be decided by the class struggle in the
West. The boom that we've seen in the last twenty years, the
upswing of capitalism, is bound to change into a downswing. Then
it is a question again of war or revolution, as the Marxists have
never tired of pointing out.</p>


<p>If we were to assume the defeat especially of
the American working class in the titanic struggles that loom
ahead, and of which the blacks' struggle is but the first
glimpse, and the seizure of power by a totalitarian fascist
system, that could mean only one thing - a world war. With modern
weapons this means annihilation.</p>


<p>It was the betrayal of the German, French and
Spanish workers that led to the second world war. The great
potential strength of the working class has in the past twenty
years prevented the imperialists attempting another major war. If
the working class is defeated in America in the coming struggles,
then the question of the H-bomb being used will really come up,
and in an hour everything that has been built up in fifty or
sixty years of the labour of the Russian people will be
destroyed.</p>


<p>The fate of all countries in the world is bound
together, today more than ever before and any attempt to infuse
blood and life into the wholly discredited Stalinist and
bureaucratic notion of 'socialism in a single country' is an
attempt to do a disservice to the revolutionary movement.</p>


<p>The continued existence of imperialism in a
number of advanced countries with all the possibilities inherent
in that situation; the fact that Stalinism through its misleading
of the working class contributed to that situation and continues
today from two centres, 'two Romes', to spread its revisionism in
the ranks of the workers' movement; the fact that this
revisionism can again contribute to victories of reaction with
the consequent unleashing of nuclear world war, is the <em>final
irrefutable proof </em>of the irrelevance and reactionary nature
of the 'single country' nonsense. It is the final and irrefutable
proof of the purely <em>national and reactionary </em>interests of
the Stalinist bureaucrats, whether in Moscow, Warsaw, Budapest,
Peking or anywhere else. Whether they like it or not, the
nationalism of Mao Tse-Tung, of Stalin and all the others is tied
up with the fate of the class struggle in the imperialist world.
In the most reactionary way, all these elements pave the way for
the possible annihilation of mankind.</p>


<p>Leninism, and not Stalinism dishonestly dressed
up as Leninism, is the only way forward for the working class and
for humanity as a whole. Only international socialism, only the
international revolution can prevent a nuclear holocaust and
guarantee the future.</p>


<h4>Theory and Practice in the Russian Revolution</h4>

<p>We will now look at how the theories and
conceptions put forward by the Mensheviks, by Lenin and by
Trotsky worked out in practice in the Russian revolution itself.</p>


<p>What were the positions of all the tendencies
in 1917, after the February revolution? The Mensheviks, logically
carrying through the programme on which they had based themselves
for two decades, together with the Social Revolutionaries,
supported the <em>bourgeois </em>Provisional Government which came
to power.</p>


<p>What was the attitude, on the other hand, of
Stalin, Kamenev, Zinoviev and of all the other 'Old Bolsheviks'
at that time? Because of the lack of clarity in the slogans of
Lenin - of a democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and
peasantry - they failed to understand the situation that existed.
Had the revolution depended on Stalin, Zinoviev, Kamenev and all
the other 'Old Bolsheviks', it would have been defeated. It would
have met the same fate as the Chinese revolution of 1925-7, the
German revolution, the Italian and French revolutions, and the
revolutions in other countries where the leadership of the
proletariat failed.</p>


<p>What was the position taken by Stalin? Stalin's
attitude was that the revolution had established the democratic
dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry <em>and therefore
full support should be given to the Provisional Government and to
the Mensheviks. </em>Stalin even said that now that the
differences between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks had been
erased by the revolution itself, they should unite with the
Mensheviks into one single united party. When Stalin and Kamenev
returned from exile, they found Molotov and some others in
control of <em>Pravda</em>, the party press. They insisted that the
line of the party press was too left; they took over the
editorship of the paper and moved in the direction of
conciliation and full support for the Provisional Government.</p>


<p>What was the attitude of Lenin? What Lenin
explained when he came to Russia in the sealed train was that in
so far as a democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and
peasantry was to be realised, <em>the Kerensky regime was the
democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry. </em>There
could be no other, except through the bourgeoisie. And Lenin now
patiently explained to the working class that the only solution
to the problem lying before the peasants, <em>the only way to
carry through the bourgeois revolution to a conclusion was in the
proletarian revolution. </em>At the same time, of course, for
Lenin as for all Marxists of that time and before, any utopian
idea of solving the problem on a Russian basis alone was ruled
out. No one, no one at all, raised the question of socialism in a
single country until Stalin in 1924.</p>


<p>The bourgeois democratic revolution has been in
existence in Ireland for forty years. No other democratic
dictatorship is possible, apart from that of Fianna Fail-Fine
Gael. Only the Irish working class of North and South, of two
imperialist-established stateless, can unify the country, can
establish the independence of the country. And they will do so on
<em>the basis of a socialist programme, with socialist slogans, </em>and
with the support of elements of the rural and urban petty
bourgeoisie.</p>


<p>The Irish bourgeoisie can go no further than
they have already gone. The place of the petit bourgeoisie is
behind the workers; they must place themselves in alliance with
the revolutionary proletarian movement. The working class must
aim at the establishment of its own power in order to solve the
problems of Ireland - that is the way to winning the support of
the Republican workers, of the workers in the Belfast shipyards
and the North. The petit bourgeoisie can be won to the support of
the workers; the question is how are they to be won? Will they be
won by capitulation to the exploiters of the Irish petit
bourgeoisie?</p>


<p>They can be won by explaining how their
interests are linked with the socialist revolution in Ireland,
with the freedom and unity of the country; and again, by
explaining how they are linked up with the interests of the
British and world working class. This is all the more important
when we consider that between one and one and a half million
Irish workers have been forced to emigrate to Britain in the last
40 years and that the coming revolutionary struggles in Ireland
will have not a small effect in Britain.</p>
