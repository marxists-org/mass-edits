According
to the national opinion polls of the middle of February the Labour
Party now has a lead of 13.5 percent over the Tories. This in spite
of the drastic measures taken by the Labour government in the field
of taxation and retrenchment. The mass of the people instinctively
believe the Tories are responsible for the plight of the economy at
the present time. Thirteen years of Tory government [1951-64] have
seen British capitalism falling behind their main capitalist rivals
in the fields of education, technique and production. It has seen
British capitalism beaten on the home market by her rivals abroad.
</p>
<p>
The
vain attempt to maintain the power of British imperialism has
virtually bankrupted British capitalism. It is one of the main causes
of the chronic balance of payments crises, every two years. In the
three years 1953-55 it averaged &#163;254 million. Government
expenditures abroad mainly for military purposes and bases totalled
&#163;695 million. In 1962-1964 it averaged &#163;237 million and government
expenditure abroad was &#163;1,304 million!
</p>
<p>
Yet
we have the propaganda of the capitalist press and the politicians
day in day out trying to put the responsibility on the lack of effort
of the working class. It would be the duty of a government claiming
to represent Labour to expose the pretensions of the capitalists and
place the facts before the working class. In this way the working
class and the people generally could be prepared for drastic measures
against the capitalists.
</p>
<p>
Instead of
this in a speech to the Overseas Bankers Club of the 7<sup>th</sup>
February Wilson boasted:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;The
measures that were taken were <em>tough,
stringent and unpopular</em>
and have shown to the world the priority that Britain attached to a
sound economic position and a strong balance of payments&#8230; <em>the
wise counsel and firm action of Mr. Governor</em>&#8230;
In the past year they set out to get a grip on public expenditure and
in the face of strong opposition made the cuts in production
programmes, particularly aircraft&#8230; In every area of British
industry where production is held back or rendered more costly by a
demarcation argument, the fact must be brought home that we are
facing ruthless competition&#8230; More than once when the Chancellor and
I were discussing the severity of the attack, I had occasion to quote
the words of the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo&#8212;&#8216;Hard pounding
this, gentlemen. Let us see who will pound longest&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<h4>Abandoned
programme</h4>
<p class="fst">
Cuts
in &#8220;state expenditure&#8221; insolently demanded by the industrialists
and bankers were signalled by the attack of the governor of the Bank
of England, an employee of the government but in reality a
representative of the &#8220;City.&#8221; These cuts were in useful public
works which limited local authority schemes to about &#163;150 million.
It meant the abandonment of the extensive election programme of
building hospitals, schools and universities. Due to the measures
taken, including the raising of the bank rate, the housing programme
is well below the modest target set of 400,000 houses last year. Only
365,000 houses were built despite the terrible shortage of houses.
This is far below the pre-war figures when they had a quarter less
population.
</p>
<p>
At
the same time heavy taxation was imposed on the &#8220;consumers&#8221; i.e.
the working class. Now hire purchase terms have been further reduced.
Formerly reduced from 3 years to 30 months on certain articles, it is
now changed to 27 months. Minimum deposits have been increased on
furniture and mattresses from 10 percent to 15 percent. The maximum
repayment has been reduced from 36 to 30 months. On radio and
television sets, tape recorders, vacuum cleaners, refrigerators,
washing machines and carpets, the minimum deposit has been further
raised from 15 to 25 percent.
</p>
<p>
These
modest &#8220;luxuries,&#8221; under modern conditions of many wives working
really necessities, are thus placed beyond the reach of the
lower-paid sections of the working class. When the Tories introduced
similar restrictions Wilson had argued that this involved social bias
against people of modest incomes.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately
the measures of the government have been even more stringent and
restrictive than those of the Tories. At every opportunity the Prime
Minister in particular has attacked so called &#8220;demarcation
disputes&#8221; and &#8220;restrictive practices.&#8221; Even if true and it is
not correct, this would not amount to a hundred thousandth part of
the waste, inefficiency and restrictive monopolistic practices of big
business, on which Wilson is silent.
</p>
<p>
Wilson
tells the bankers and industrialists what they want to hear. While
threatening the trade unions and the working class he kow-tows to the
capitalists. No wonder for the moment they regard him as another
version of Supermac [Note: a reference to the previous Tory Prime
Minister, MacMillan] and praise him as a &#8220;statesman.&#8221; It is not
so long ago that they ranted and raved in maniacal fashion against
the Labour government and its chief minister.
</p>
<p>
Now
Wilson who formerly attacked mergers and monopolies comes out in
favour and actually assists in the process of &#8220;merging and
monopolisation.&#8221; Everything is turned on its head. The capitalists
are assisted, the wages of the workers are restricted. The tops of
industry and the state receive increases of salaries from 12 to 50
percent including the members of Parliament themselves, the workers
they try and restrict to 3.5 percent and then with strings. As Mr.
Jay declared in the Commons on 7<sup>th</sup>
February:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Individual
investment continues at a high level; and exports have been rising
strongly. In these circumstances we must continue to ensure that
consumption does not make undue demands upon our resources.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
This
means in practice that the re-equipment of British industry in so far
as it proceeds will be at the expense of the working class.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
the rich grow richer than ever. Profits continually break records.
Last year they were higher than ever. Surtax rose by &#163;6 million to
&#163;184.4 million. The number of surtax payers grew by 9,000 to
305,000. The economy works for the benefit of this tiny segment of
the population. The myth of an &#8220;equalisation of incomes&#8221; and a
one-class structure in Britain is soon dispelled when one examines
the figures of the Inland Revenue. Nearly 15 million people own less
than &#163;1,000. At the same time 110 people have incomes of more than
&#163;100,000 or nearly &#163;2,000 per week!
</p>
<p>
Under
these conditions the policy of Wilson cannot be distinguished from
the policy of the Tories. No wonder the most discerning tops of big
business are complacent at the possibility of a further extension of
Labour government. They achieve two objects. On the one hand they
smear the labour movement with the crimes and failings of capitalism,
which they then pretend are due to socialism; and on the other hand
they find it easier to use the Labour government to try and carry out
policies which would meet with stiff resistance if introduced by the
Tories.
</p>
<p>
The
working class asks very little from society at the present time,
peace, homes, security, decent wages and conditions, a reasonable
education leisure and recreation. Even after 20 years of relative
economic upswing capitalism fails to provide these basic necessities.
</p>
<p>
At
the same time as competition on the world market gets fiercer the
capitalists of all countries adopt similar measures of
&#8220;modernisation,&#8221; subsidies to the industrialists to introduce new
machinery &#8220;incomes policy&#8221; etc. etc. Thus because the British
capitalists have lagged behind, it will be difficult for them to
catch up.
</p>
<p>
Like
their rivals they try and impose the costs of this on to the working
class. But all doing it mutually over a period it will cancel out.
Only the working class of all these countries will be worse off.
</p>
<h4>Real plan of
production</h4>
<p class="fst">
Thus
the narrow nationally limited and imperialist policy of Wilson cannot
solve any of the problems facing British capitalism. On a capitalist
basis every government is compelled to act in a similar way. Only a
breakaway from capitalist policies can end the impasse. As a start it
would be necessary to nationalise with minimum compensation, the
private banks, the insurance companies, and the 400 monopolies, who
between them control two-thirds of the wealth of the country. Then on
a democratic basis mapping out the resources of the country,
harnessing the &#163;100,000 million of wealth in factories, buildings,
machinery, etc. built up by technique and the labour of the working
class. By drawing in the workers and scientists, the technicians and
small businessmen housewives and co-ops, the basis could be laid for
a 20 percent and even more increase in production, which could be
rapidly used to transform the economic and social situation in
Britain.
</p>
<p>
Explaining
the real crisis of capitalism and fighting on such a programme the
Labour Party could obtain an immense majority. However, even on the
present limited programme the obtaining of a big majority would pose
very favourable opportunities for the transformation of the labour
movement.
