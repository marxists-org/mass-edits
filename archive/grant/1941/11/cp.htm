	<p class="quoteb">25<sup>th</sup> November, 1941.</p>

	<p class="quoteb">To the Secretary of the Communist Party</p>

<p class="quoteb">Your leading body has recently issued a slanderous statement to Branch 

Secretaries regarding the <i>Socialist Appeal</i> and the Fourth 

Internationalists in Britain. We denounce your assertions that the Trotskyists 

are, or ever have been, agents or supporters of Nazism or Fascism. Further, we 

challenge you to substantiate this document in public debate before the members 

of your Party and the workers of Britain.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The <i>Sunday Dispatch</i> has already made use of your document as 

justification for its attacks against worker militants in general and against 

the <i>Socialist Appeal</i> in particular. The manner in which it is presented, 

proves that your present policy closely coincides with that of the most 

reactionary clique in British capitalist newspaper publications. Tomorrow, these 

very people will be clamouring for the suppression of the Communist Party.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Your document indicates that the Communist Party of Great Britain is 

preparing to play the role of strike-breaker-in-chief and police agent for 

Churchill and his government. It is an invitation to the Government to suppress 

the <i>Socialist Appeal</i> and ban our organisation. But it also contains a 

directive to Communist Party members to commit acts of physical violence against 

Fourth Internationalists and salesmen of the <i>Socialist Appeal</i>. In your 

statement to the Young Communist League secretaries you state:</p>



	<p class="quotec">&#8220;We are too tolerant of these people. They are allowed to sell their 

	paper <i>Socialist Appeal</i> outside meetings. They have even become 

	members of the Communist Party and Y.C.L. We must be utterly ruthless with 

	these people. They spread confusion amongst the working class and do serious 

	harm to our Party.&#8221;</p>



<p class="quoteb">These are methods of fascist reaction and cannot but harm the working class 

movement. You cannot answer our policy in open discussion because this would 

result in the exposure of the falsity of C.P. policy and the correctness of the 

programme of the Fourth International. Fearing the ideas of Marx and Lenin which 

we represent, you resort to anti-working class methods of slander and violence. 

We appeal to the rank and file members of the C.P. and Y.C.L. not to be misled, but 

to conduct polemics on working class policy on the basis of open and comradely 

argument and discussion, and by these means find a way to the correct policy for 

the workers. We will not be intimidated by methods of hooliganism but will 

protect our right to distribute our propaganda among the workers.</p>

<p class="quoteb">In recent months, since the capitulation of the Communist Party to the 

Churchill government, many members of the Party have joined the ranks of the 

Fourth International. Your statement that Trotskyists have joined the Party 

would appear to be a reply to this reaction of party militants and a preparation 

for the intensified expulsions from the Party of all who oppose your present 

reactionary policy.</p>

<p class="quoteb">We are holding a meeting on December 21<sup>st</sup> at the Holborn Hall at 6.30 pm to 

expose the slanders of the pro-fascist <i>Sunday Dispatch</i> and of the 

Communist Party. An opportunity will be given to any spokesmen of the Communist 

Party whom you would like to nominate to justify your statements. Failure to 

avail yourself of this opportunity will brand you as slanderers and deceivers of 

the working class.</p>
