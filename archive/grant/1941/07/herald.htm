In the past it has been the prerogative of the Stalinists   to slander and vilify the internationalist wing of the labour movement by amalgams   and frame-ups. Now we see the defenders of &#8216;democracy&#8217;, who held   up their hands in horror at the methods of Stalin in the Moscow trials, descending   to the same level. The refusal to publish our refutation, even accepting that   this report was &#8216;included accidentally&#8217;, shows what will be the   position of the internationalists in the coming period. It is the duty of all   Labour Party members, socialists and Trade Unionists to fight against such methods   of political struggle in the labour movement.&#8211;Editor.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p><p class="quoteb"><strong>Workers&#8217; International League &#8211; Fourth International</strong><br />  Publication: <em>Workers&#8217; International News</em><br />  61 Northdown Street<br />  London N.1.<br />  21<sup>st</sup> July, 1941</p>  <p class="quoteb">To the editor,<br />  <em>Daily Herald</em></p>
  
<p class="quoteb">Dear Sir,</p><p class="quoteb">It has been brought to our notice that the issue of the <em>Daily Herald</em> dated 16<sup>th</sup>   July, 1941, features a report of the trial of 33 German spies. In this report   is contained an amalgam of another, an entirely separate trial, which is in   no way connected with this spy case.</p>  <p class="quoteb">This may be accidental or otherwise, but it gives a slanderous impression that   the trial of the American leaders of the Minneapolis General Drivers&#8217;   Union, Local 554, also leaders and supporters of the Socialist Workers&#8217;   Party (Fourth International), is linked together with the spy trial.</p>  <p class="quoteb">With the trial of the Nazi spies, who will receive their deserts, we are not   concerned. But whatever one&#8217;s opinions of the politics of the revolutionary   socialists, they cannot in any way be tarred with the dirty brush of Nazism.   They stand for international socialism, &ldquo;&#8230;accepting as an ideal   formula the Russian Revolution of 1917&rdquo;, and are implacable opponents   of Hitler and what he represents. To link them up in this manner is on a par   with the slander against Lenin of being a German spy.</p>  <p class="quoteb">This libellous report damages and casts credit not only on these 29 Trade Union   leaders and the thousands of workers they represent, but also reflects on the   whole international socialist movement of the Fourth International, including   its British followers who stand irreconcilably for the overthrow of Hitlerism   and for the defence of the Soviet Union, and advocate that only a workers&#8217;   government in Britain can achieve those ends.</p>  <p class="quoteb">We trust that the official organ of the British Labour Party will take Immediate   steps to dispel the false impression which the report, whether deliberately   or accidentally, conveys to the British working class. In the interests of political   honesty we demand the unabridged publication of this letter. Failure to comply   with this will brand the <em>Daily Herald</em> as a dishonest and slanderous   journal.</p>  <p class="quoteb">Signed: E. Grant,<br />  For the Executive Committee,<br />  Workers&#8217; International League.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p class="fst">Copy of reply from the <em>Daily Herald</em>, July 23<sup>rd</sup>, 1941:</p><p class="quoteb"><em>Daily Herald</em> Editorial Office,<br />  2-12 Endell Street, <br />  Long Acre,<br />  London, W.C.2.<br />  PC/DMS</p>  <p class="quoteb">E. Grant,<br />  Workers&#8217; International League,<br />  61 Northdown Street, N.1.</p>  <p class="quoteb">Dear Sir,</p><p class="quoteb">I have made a full enquiry into the matter raised in your letter of July 21<sup>st</sup>,   and I find that the indictment against 29 leaders of the Minneapolis General   Drivers&#8217; Union was included accidentally in our report of the trial of   alleged Nazi spies.</p>  <p class="quoteb">I cannot agree with you that this is in anyway damaging to the Minneapolis Union   leaders, since they were not mentioned at all in the report.  In these circumstances I see no point in drawing further attention to the matter   by publication of your letter.</p>  <p class="quoteb">Yours faithfully,</p><p class="quoteb">Percy Cudlipp, Editor</p>  <p class="skip">&#160;</p>
