   <p>Kiev  has fallen to the legions of German imperialism. The Donetz Basin  is threatened. Leningrad and Odessa are besieged. Even the bourgeois press  speaks of the seriousness of the military situation in which the Soviet Union finds itself and is already preparing an  alibi for the failure to send substantial aid.</p>
<p>
     The  German armies are blasting their way inch by inch into Soviet territory, paying  a bloody price in casualties, it is true. Already the regions conquered are  twice the area of greater Germany.  The bitterly contested but triumphant advance of the German troops is due, of  course, to the superiority of German technique, organisation, industry and  military skill over that of Russia.</p>
<p>
     But  in war, morale is the decisive factor. Even these victories would not be of  vital importance if the armies of German imperialism had their morale  shattered. The German soldier today is apathetic and indifferent. Insofar as  Russian propaganda has any effect, it serves only to drive him, in despair,  into support of Hitler. At the time of the wars of intervention almost the  whole of Russia  was at one time in the hands of imperialism. All that was left to the  Bolsheviks at one period were the two towns Petrograd and Moscow and one province. An overwhelming  superiority in military equipment was in the hands of the armies of  intervention. Annihilation of the young Soviet Republic  seemed certain. And if it had been allowed to remain a purely military  question, annihilation would have been the result. But that was a revolutionary  war, led by Lenin and Trotsky.</p>
<p>
     What  are the methods of waging a revolutionary war for which the <em>Socialist Appeal</em> calls - the methods  which would avert the disasters now facing the Workers' State?</p>
<p>
     First:  the reintroduction of complete workers' democracy within the Soviet   Union, and the re-establishment of Soviets.</p>
<p>
     Second:  a clear explanation to the peoples of the Soviet Union, Germany and the  world, of the real nature and causes of the war. Not the lying and meaningless  statements of the capitalist politicians, that it is due to the blood-lust and  megalomania of Adolph Hitler. But the simple truth that it is in the interests  of finance capital and the preservation of the capitalist system. Above all, it  is the duty of Stalin to clearly differentiate to the German workers between  the war being fought by the Soviet Union and that being waged by capitalist Britain under  Churchill.</p>
<p>
   Third:  instead of the chauvinist appeal, an international socialist call to the German  and European workers and soldiers for the extension of the socialist revolution  to all Europe; this would be the only means of  awakening the class solidarity of the once proud and mighty German working  class.</p>

   <h4>Necessary conditions for workers' democracy</h4>
   <p>
     Stalin  and the Soviet bureaucracy will not and cannot make use of these revolutionary  methods. Why? Workers have often asked us - &quot;If you are in favour of the  Soviet Union why do you attack the leaders in Russia?&quot;</p>
<p>
     Russia is a workers' state because  the land, mines, banks, factories, railways have been taken out of the hands of  the capitalists and have been nationalised. That is why, in spite of all the  crimes of Stalin, the Soviet Union must be  defended by every class-conscious worker to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>
     Lenin  laid down certain conditions for the existence of a workers' state which can be  summed up as follows:<br />
     1.  All officials to be elected with right of recall through workers' Councils  (Soviets).<br />
     2.  The abolition of the standing army and its substitution by the armed people.<br />
     3.  No official to receive a wage higher than that of a skilled worker.<br />
     4.  Administrative posts to be filled gradually in rotation so that no permanent  officialdom could be formed.</p>

   <h4>What is the &quot;Stalinist Bureaucracy&quot;?</h4>
    <p> But  a similar process has taken place in Russia  to that which took place in the Labour and Trade Union movement in Britain. The  trade union movement here was formed as a weapon of struggle against  capitalism. But the officials - the Citrines and Bevins - gradually took over  control and operated the trade unions in their own interests. Every trade unionist  knows this from his own experience. But this does not mean to say we reject  trade unionism. What it does mean is that we must conduct a struggle to get rid  of the Citrines and Bevins and the whole strata of bureaucrats in order to  transform the trade unions into fighting instruments of the working class.</p>
<p>
     In Russia,  likewise, because of the backward development of the country and the defeats of  the world working class, power has been seized out of the hands of the workers  by the officialdom, the bureaucracy. In this case the officials not of a trade  union, but of a state. The 11 million government officials, managers, heads of  industry, etcetera, are now utilising the workers' state in their own interests  instead of those of the workers. All the conditions laid down by Lenin are  being eradicated. The Soviets no longer exist. The officials are arbitrarily  appointed and removed from above with the workers having no control over them.  In place of the armed people, we have the old reactionary caste system restored  in the army and the privileged officer strata. The law that the wages of  officials do not exceed those of the skilled workers was abolished years ago.</p>
<p>
     This  privileged caste defends its power and privileges against the working class,  just as Morrison and his ilk do. To understand this is to understand the  destruction of the entire Old Bolshevik Guard, the destruction of the rights of  the working class, of the officer cadres of the Red Army when 90% of the  General Staff were murdered and three quarters of the officers executed. The  representative of this bureaucracy is Stalin, who has organised nothing but  defeats for the workers.</p>

   <h4>Internationalism is the only Salvation</h4>
    <p> The  victories under Lenin and Trotsky were obtained, not only by the response of  the Allied and German working class to their international calls, but by  relying on the democratic organisations of the workers. Lenin based his power  on the workers, placed his trust on their initiative and self-sacrifice, and  made his first rule to tell the workers the truth. At every crisis in the wars  of Intervention, the Bolsheviks made an open, worldwide appeal to the masses,  never misinforming them or sowing illusions. But the incompetent and venal  bureaucracy dare not do this. One of the principal factors in the  demoralisation of the French nation was the vicious censorship. In Russia today we  see the contempt and panic with which the bureaucracy regards the masses in an  even more rigid stifling of news. According to the <em>News Chronicle</em> Moscow  correspondent, the destruction of the Dniepnostroy Dam was not known to the  masses of the people in the capital. The correspondent himself was not aware of  it until he heard it on the British wireless.</p>

   <h4>Brabazon's policy is Churchill's policy</h4><p>
     The  acceptance by Stalin of the Atlantic Charter deception is a betrayal of the  workers of Russia  and the world. Churchill and Roosevelt are despatching carefully calculated aid  to Russia.  But behind the scenes, the policy which Moore-Brabazon indiscreetly blurted out  is the policy of the ruling class. They wish to see the Soviet Union destroyed  - but only after Germany  has been sufficiently weakened to collapse under the offensive of  Anglo-American imperialism. By relying on them, Stalin has placed the workers'  state in the gravest danger of destruction. The capitalists will turn the flow  of supplies on and off as it suits them.</p>
<p>
     Under  the most favourable conditions, the production of war materials within the  Soviet Union is only half that of Germany  and occupied Europe. But with the occupation  of some of the main industrial areas of the USSR, this disparity is now even  greater. From this point of view, apart from the superiority of German military  technique and organisation, if Hitler retains the support of the German people  and his armies and if the peoples in occupied Europe do not rise (and these two  conditions are largely interdependent), then Russia is doomed.</p>
<p>
     Reliance  upon the capitalist democracies means inevitable disaster. Churchill and  Roosevelt are not out to smash fascism or defend the conquests of October. The  ruling class is taking advantage of the sentiment among the workers for support  of the Soviet Union for their own ends. That  is what lies behind the &quot;Tanks for Russia Week&quot; which was launched by  Beaverbrook. Every worker would like to see the greatest possible material  support sent to the gallant defenders of the USSR. But while control of these  supplies remains in the hands of the ruling class there is no guarantee that  these will be sent when most needed, or even that they will be sent at all. To  trust the promises of aid given by Mr Moore-Brabazon and his ilk who control  the government, would be suicidal.</p>

   <h4>The USSR  will be defended our way</h4>
    <p> Russia must be defended in spite  of the fact that Stalin and the bureaucracy are in control, in the same way as  we defend the trade unions from capitalist attack even though the labour  bureaucrats control them. The defeat of Russia would signal the most  terrible setback for the working class for the past two decades. Because of this,  we dare not sow illusions among the workers. The only guarantee that real aid  will be despatched to our Russian brothers in sufficient quantities to affect  the issue of the great battles, is when the Shop Stewards and Trade Union  Committees control the despatch of supplies.</p>
<p>
     The  tasks of the British workers arc clear: full support for the fight of the Soviet Union against the onslaught of German imperialism.  But to rally behind Churchill and the British ruling class would be to make  certain the ultimate destruction of the Soviet Union  and the victory of fascism. Only a workers' government in Britain could  impel the German masses to overthrow Hitler and together with the Russian and  British workers, establish a Socialist Europe.</p>
