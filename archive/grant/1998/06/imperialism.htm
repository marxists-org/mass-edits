      <p>It is nearly seven years since George Bush, the then president of the US,  made his famous &ldquo;New World Order&rdquo; speech. This was in 1991. In the build-up to  the Gulf War the main imperialist power on earth promised a world without wars,  without dictatorships and, of course, a world firmly under the control of a  single all-powerful world policeman&#8212;the US. After the fall of Stalinism, US  imperialism really thought that the world would be firmly under their command  and they would be able to dictate the destiny of each and every country. All  conflicts in the world were to be solved through dialogue in a kind of &ldquo;Pax  Americana.&rdquo; Now all these dreams have been reduced to rubble. </p>
  <p>
The crushing domination of imperialism in the world arena, which was  strengthened after the fall of Stalinism, has meant an increased exploitation  of the Third World as a whole. The domination of the metropolitan countries is,  if anything, still greater than in the past. The only difference is that the  old direct military-bureaucratic control by individual colonial masters has  been substituted by the collective domination of the colonial world by a  handful of wealthy exploiter states through the mechanism of the world market.  Under the banner of &ldquo;globalisation&rdquo; and &ldquo;opening up of the markets&rdquo; imperialism  has forced through a policy of lowering the tariff barriers and privatisation  of the utilities throughout the Third World. These policies are a result of the  crisis of capitalism in the West which forces it to constantly look for new  markets and fields of investment. But they spell bankruptcy for the local  industries of the countries affected which cannot compete unaided against the  big multinationals. This situation has produced the most ruinous consequences,  and has produced results not foreseen by President Bush.</p>
  <p>
Typically, the strategists of the US were very short-sighted. They failed  to understand what Trotsky had explained even before the Second World War. He  predicted that the United States would emerge victorious from the forthcoming  war, but as a result would have dynamite built into its foundations. Now we see  that this prediction is coming true. The collapse of the USSR has transformed  the relations between the powers, establishing the USA as the only world  superpower. Never in human history has a single country enjoyed such a crushing  economic and military domination. Yet in one crisis after another it has become  manifest that US imperialism is a colossus with feet of clay. Despite its  military victory in the Gulf War, it was unable to remove Saddam Hussein. The  attempt at a military intervention against the barefoot militias in Somalia  ended in a humiliating defeat. Now the crisis in Asia and especially the events  in Indonesia have placed revolution firmly on the agenda. To the South, the USA  faces a general crisis in Central and Latin America, with social and political  upheavals in Mexico, an implacable guerrilla war in Colombia and an explosive  situation in Argentina and Brazil. Wherever it looks, US imperialism can see  not one single stable bourgeois regime. The whole world has entered the most  convulsive period for a hundred years.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>The debt burden</strong> </h4>
  <p>
The ruthless over-exploitation of the Third World, intensified after the  collapse of Stalinism has meant an enormous transfer of wealth from these  countries to the coffers of the big multinational companies and banks. This can  be seen in the burden of the debt, which has reached such proportions that even  before the G8 meeting in Birmingham (May 1998) there was some talk about debt  relief initiatives for some of the poorest countries. In the end nothing was  agreed. The World Bank has also started a Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)  programme aimed at cutting the debt burden of 41 countries which spend more  than 20 per cent of their export earning in debt service payments&#8212;never mind  about actual repayment of the debt.</p>
  <p>
All these plans are not born out of the good will and charitable intentions  of the World Bank and IMF executives. There are three main reasons for this.  First of all it is very unlikely that these countries are ever going to be able  to pay their debts at all. Therefore they have decided to recognise reality and  make the Western governments pay back what is owed to the lending banks with  taxpayers&rsquo; money. In this way the banks never lose. The main aim of these debt  relief initiatives is, on the one hand, to make sure the bankers get their  money back and on the other to lift these highly indebted countries to a point  were they are able to ask for more loans! Secondly, the amount of the debt that  these highly indebted countries owe as a percentage of the total debt of former  colonial countries is very small. And thirdly, these plans come with a lot of  conditions attached. The countries involved have to put in practice the &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo;  (that is, orders) of the IMF.</p>
  <p>
The IMF&rsquo;s infamous Structural Adjustment Plans (SAPs) have now been around  for long enough to know what their consequences are. To give just one example,  Zambia was a relatively developed country, with schools and hospitals, an  education service and a modern infrastructure built mainly on the basis of the  income from the copper mines. A decade of &ldquo;Structural Adjustment&rdquo; managed to  push life expectancy down from 54.4 years in 1991 to 42.6 years in 1997.  Literacy rates are declining, and, as a direct result of the increase in  hospitals charges, there are now 203 infant deaths per 1,000 births compared to  125 in 1991. Access to clean water is declining and 98.1 per cent of the  population live on $2 a day or less. Debt represents 225 per cent of the GDP.  It is no surprise therefore that there have been recently food riots in Zambia  &#8212;and in other African countries, like Zimbabwe and Tanzania.</p>
  <p>
The debt burden of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries represents 94 per cent of  their annual economic input. For the countries in line for the HIPC programme  this figure averages 125 per cent. The percentage of the debt in relation to  export earnings has reached unheard-of levels: Somalia 3,671 per cent,  Guinea-Bissau 3,509 per cent, Sudan 2,131 per cent, Mozambique 1,411 per cent,  Ethiopia 1,377 per cent, Rwanda 1,374 per cent, Burundi 1,131 per cent. And the  situation, far from improving, is actually worsening. In 1980 the total debt of  underdeveloped countries was $600 billion. In 1990 it had gone up to $1.4  trillion and in 1997 the figure was a staggering $2.17 trillion. It is  important to note that in the 1990-97 period, when the total debt increased by  $770 billion, these countries had actually paid $1.83 trillion just on debt  servicing! An even more scandalous picture emerges if we compare debt servicing  payments with aid given to these countries: for every $1 they receive in aid,  they pay back $11 dollars in debt servicing.</p>
  <p>
The effects of this situation are evident. The situation in the whole of  Sub-Saharan Africa is a nightmare. According to The Economist (6/6/98), &ldquo;Nearly  half the continent&rsquo;s 760m people are &lsquo;profoundly poor&rsquo;, surviving, it is said  by the ADB African Development Bank], on less than $1 a day. Despite  encouraging signs in some parts of the continent, average real GDP growth fell  in 1997 to 3.7 per cent from 5 per cent the previous year. Africa&rsquo;s recovery is  still fragile and as vulnerable as ever to commodity prices and bad weather.  Globalisation of world trade &hellip; could push the continent&rsquo;s economy further  towards the margins. According to the World Bank, Africa attracted just 1.5 per  cent of the world&rsquo;s foreign direct investment in 1996. The biggest recipient,  getting 32 per cent of the total, was Nigeria, which, apart from having a lot  of oil, is not reforming its economy in the way that the World Bank says is  essential for attracting foreign investment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
Increased impoverishment of the population in most of the colonial world  has given rise to an increase in criminality, black market and the &ldquo;informal  economy&rdquo;. In some cases the black market represents a bigger share of the  economy than the official market and infiltrates all sections of the state  apparatus. They try to protect their interests in the political arena through  fundamentalist and &ldquo;populist&rdquo; forces. These are powerful economic forces which  in many cases have interests which enter into conflict with those of imperialism.  Thus, at all levels, the decay of capitalism undermines the very basis of  civilised human existence for two-thirds of the planet. As Lenin warned, the  prolonged existence of capitalism signifies &ldquo;horror without end.&rdquo;</p>
  <h4>
<strong>The role of the working class</strong> </h4>
  <p>
Marx, Engels and Lenin always laid stress on the leading role of the  proletariat in the revolution. They explained that only the working class can  bring about the socialist revolution. No other class can fulfil this role. Why  was this? It was not a caprice or an arbitrary assumption. It is based upon the  role of the workers in production, and the fact that participation in  collective (&ldquo;social&rdquo;) production means that the working class alone develops a  socialist (collectivist) consciousness. This is not the case with any other  class. The peasantry is a class of small proprietors. Even the landless  peasants, the rural proletarians, frequently aspire to the possession of land;  hence the slogan &ldquo;land to the tiller&rdquo;&#8212;which, despite its tremendous  revolutionary significance, has a bourgeois, not a socialist, content. The  students and intellectuals have a strong tendency towards petty bourgeois  individualism, which frequently manifests itself even when they try to adopt a  revolutionary position.</p>
  <p>
Through his or her life&rsquo;s experience, the proletarian learns to understand  collective organisation and discipline. This is the result of the hard school  of capitalist production and exploitation, which prepares the worker for the  class struggle. The normal weapons of the proletariat are the methods of mass  struggle&#8212;the strike, the general strike, mass demonstrations, which act as a  school that prepare it for the ultimate task of taking the running of society  into its hands. The workers&rsquo; movement everywhere is a school of democracy.  Before the workers decide to strike, there is a democratic discussion in which  opinions for and against are heard. But once the vote is taken, the workers act  as one. Those who attempt to defy the democratic decision of the workers and  break the strike are treated as scabs ought to be treated. The picket line is  the concrete expression of the will of the majority. In the course of the  strike, the workers participate, think and discuss. Every worker knows that you  learn more during one day on strike than in years of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; activity. In  effect, every strike contains elements of a revolution, and a revolution is  like a strike on a vast scale. Many of the processes that occur in the class  are analogous, although the two are qualitatively different of course. But in  both cases the key element is the active and conscious participation of the  working class, which begins to take its destiny into its own hands instead of  leaving the important decisions in the hands of other people&#8212;trade union  leaders, parliamentarians, councillors and bureaucrats. This is the essence of  socialism, or, more correctly, of workers&rsquo; power.</p>
  <p>
Socialism is democratic or it is nothing. From the very first day of the  socialist revolution, there must be the most democratic regime, a regime that  will mean that, for the first time, all the tasks of running industry, society  and the state will be in the hands of the majority of society, the working  class. Through their democratically-elected committees (the soviets), directly  elected at the workplace and subject to recall at any moment, the workers will  be the masters of society not just in name but in fact. This was the position  in Russia after the October revolution. Let us recall that Lenin laid down four  basic conditions for a workers&rsquo; state&#8212;that is, for the transitional period  between capitalism and socialism: </p>
      <ol type="disc">
        <li>Free and democratic elections with right of       recall of all officials. </li>
        <li>No official must receive a higher wage than a       skilled worker. </li>
        <li>No standing army but the armed people. </li>
        <li>Gradually, all the tasks of running the state       should be carried out by the masses on a rotating basis. When everybody is       a bureaucrat in turn, nobody is a bureaucrat. Or, as Lenin put it, &ldquo;Any       cook should be able to be prime minister.&rdquo; </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Only on such a basis can society begin to move in the direction of  socialism&#8212;the highest stage of human society which Engels described as  humanity&rsquo;s leap from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. Clearly  such a development requires a high development of the productive forces. That  is why Marx and Engels thought that the socialist revolution would begin in  France, be continued in Germany and be finished in England. At that time the  working class only existed in these countries. Marx and Engels, and even Lenin  until 1917, did not even consider the possibility of the working class coming  to power in a backward country first. Socialism demands a certain level of  development of industry, agriculture, science, and technique at the outset.  Only on this basis could the workers have sufficient free time&#8212;on the basis of  the reduction of the working day&#8212;to participate in the running of society,  industry and the state.</p>
  <p>
        However, the situation was radically altered after the death of Marx and  Engels by the advent of imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism analysed  by Lenin in his famous book of that name. Lenin explained that one of the main  features of imperialism is the export of capital from the advanced countries to  the colonies and semi-colonies. On the basis of the law of combined and uneven  development, a powerful working class grew up in backward countries like  tsarist Russia, a fact which did not alter its character as a backward,  semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. The main point of polemic between the  different tendencies of the Russian labour movement before 1917 was precisely  the character of the Russian revolution, and the relation between the classes  in the revolution. Undoubtedly, the theory that anticipated and explained what  actually took place in 1917 was worked out by Trotsky.</p>
  <h4>
  <strong>The permanent revolution </strong> </h4>
  <p>
        The theory of the permanent revolution was first developed by Trotsky as  early as 1904. The permanent revolution, while accepting that the objective  tasks facing the Russian workers were those of the bourgeois democratic  revolution, nevertheless explained how in a backward country in the epoch of  imperialism, the &ldquo;national bourgeoisie&rdquo; was inseparably linked to the remains  of feudalism on the one hand and to imperialist capital on the other and was  therefore completely unable to carry through any of its historical tasks. The  rottenness of the bourgeois liberals, and their counterrevolutionary role in  the bourgeois-democratic revolution, was already observed by Marx and Engels.  In his article The Bourgeoisie and the Counter-revolution (1848), Marx writes:</p>
  <p class="quote">
  &ldquo;The German bourgeoisie has developed so slothfully, cravenly and slowly  that at the moment when it menacingly faced feudalism and absolutism it saw  itself menacingly faced by the proletariat and all factions of the burgers  whose interests and ideas were akin to those of the proletariat. And it saw  inimically arrayed not only a class behind it but all Europe before it. The  Prussian bourgeoisie was not, as the French of 1789 had been, the class which  represented the whole of modern society vis-a-vis the representatives of the  old society, the monarchy and the nobility. It had sunk to the level of a kind  of social estate, as distinctly opposed to the crown as to the people, eager to  be in the opposition to both, irresolute against each of its opponents , taken  severally, because it always saw both of them before or behind it; inclined to  betray the people and compromise with the crowned representative of the old  society because it itself already belonged to the old society; &ldquo;. (K. Marx, The  Bourgeoisie and the Counter-revolution, in MESW, vol. 1, p. 140-1.)</p>
  <p>
        The bourgeoisie, Marx explains, did not come to power as a result of its  own revolutionary exertions, but as a result of the movement of the masses in  which it played no role: &ldquo;The Prussian bourgeoisie was hurled to the height of  state power, however not in the manner it had desired, by a peaceful bargain  with the crown but by a revolution&rdquo;. (K. Marx, The Bourgeoisie and the  Counter-revolution, MESW, vol. 1, p. 138.)</p>
  <p>
        Even in the epoch of the bourgeois-democratic revolution in Europe, Marx  and Engels mercilessly unmasked the cowardly, counterrevolutionary role of the  bourgeoisie, and emphasised the need for the workers to maintain a policy of  complete class independence, not only from the bourgeois liberals, but also  from the vacillating petty bourgeois democrats:</p>
  <p class="quote">
  &ldquo;The proletarian, or really revolutionary party,&rdquo; wrote Engels, &ldquo;succeeded  only very gradually in withdrawing the mass of the working people from the  influence of the democrats whose tail they formed in the beginning of the  revolution. But in due time the indecision weakness and cowardice of the  democratic leaders did the rest, and it may now be said to be one of the  principal results of the last years&rsquo; convulsions, that wherever the working  class is concentrated in anything like considerable masses, they are entirely  freed from that democratic influence which led them into an endless series of  blunders and misfortunes during 1848 and 1849.&rdquo; (F. Engels, Revolution and  Counter-revolution in Germany, MESW, vol. 1, p. 332.) </p>
  <p>
        The situation is clearer still today. The national bourgeoisie in the  colonial countries entered into the scene of history too late, when the world  had already been divided up between a few imperialist powers. It was not able  to play any progressive role and was born completely subordinated to its former  colonial masters. The weak and degenerate bourgeoisie in Asia, Latin America  and Africa is too dependent on foreign capital and imperialism, to carry  society forward. It is tied with a thousand threads, not only to foreign  capital, but with the class of landowners, with which it forms a reactionary  bloc that represents a bulwark against progress. Whatever differences may exist  between these elements are insignificant in comparison with the fear that  unites them against the masses. Only the proletariat, allied with the poor  peasants and urban poor, can solve the problems of society by taking power into  its own hands, expropriating the imperialists and the bourgeoisie, and  beginning the task of transforming society on socialist lines.</p>
  <p>
        By setting itself at the head of the nation, leading the oppressed layers  of society (urban and rural petty-bourgeoisie), the proletariat could take  power and then carry through the tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution  (mainly the land reform and the unification and liberation of the country from  foreign domination). However, once having come to power, the proletariat would  not stop there but would start to implement socialist measures of expropriation  of the capitalists. And as these tasks cannot be solved in one country alone,  especially not in a backward country, this would be the beginning of the world  revolution. Thus the revolution is &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; in two senses: because it starts  with the bourgeois tasks and continues with the socialist ones, and because it  starts in one country and continues at an international level.</p>
  <p>
        The theory of the permanent revolution was the most complete answer to the  reformist and class collaborationist position of the right wing of the Russian  workers&rsquo; movement, the Mensheviks. The two stage theory was developed by the  Mensheviks as their perspective for the Russian revolution. It basically states  that, since the tasks of the revolution are those of the national democratic  bourgeois revolution, the leadership of the revolution must be taken by the  national democratic bourgeoisie. For his part, Lenin agreed with Trotsky that  the Russian Liberals could not carry out the bourgeois-democratic revolution,  and that this task could only be carried out by the proletariat in alliance  with the poor peasantry. Following in the footsteps of Marx, who had described  the bourgeois &ldquo;democratic party&rdquo; as &ldquo;far more dangerous to the workers than the  previous liberals&rdquo;, Lenin explained that the Russian bourgeoisie, far from  being an ally of the workers, would inevitably side with the  counter-revolution.</p>
  <p class="quote">
  &ldquo;The bourgeoisie in the mass&rdquo; he wrote in 1905, &ldquo;will inevitably turn  towards the counter-revolution, and against the people as soon as its narrow,  selfish interests are met, as soon as it &lsquo;recoils&rsquo; from consistent democracy  (and it is already recoiling from it!). (Lenin, Collected Works, vol. 9, p.  98.)</p>
  <p>
        What class, in Lenin&rsquo;s view, could lead the bourgeois-democratic  revolution? &ldquo;There remains &lsquo;the people&rsquo;, that is, the proletariat and the  peasantry. The proletariat alone can be relied on to march on to the end, for  it goes far beyond the democratic revolution. That is why the proletariat  fights in the forefront for a republic and contemptuously rejects stupid and  unworthy advice to take into account the possibility of the bourgeoisie  recoiling&rdquo; (Ibid.)</p>
  <p>
        In all of Lenin&rsquo;s speeches and writings, the counter-revolutionary role of  the bourgeois-democratic Liberals is stressed time and time again. However, up  until 1917, he did not believe that the Russian workers would come to power  before the socialist revolution in the West&#8212;a perspective that only Trotsky  defended before 1917, when it was fully adopted by Lenin in his April theses.  The correctness of the permanent revolution was triumphantly demonstrated by  the October Revolution itself. The Russian working class&#8212;as Trotsky had  predicted in 1904&#8212;came to power before the workers of Western Europe. They  carried out all the tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, and  immediately set about nationalising industry and passing over to the tasks of  the socialist revolution. The bourgeoisie played an openly counterrevolutionary  role, but was defeated by the workers in alliance with the poor peasants. The  Bolsheviks then made a revolutionary appeal to the workers of the world to  follow their example. Lenin knew very well that without the victory of the  revolution in the advanced capitalist countries, especially Germany, the  revolution could not survive isolated, especially in a backward country like  Russia. What happened subsequently showed that this was absolutely correct. The  setting up of the Third (Communist) International, the world party of socialist  revolution, was the concrete manifestation of this perspective.</p>
  <p>
        Had the Communist International remained firm on the positions of Lenin and  Trotsky, the victory of the world revolution would have been ensured.  Unfortunately, the Comintern&rsquo;s formative years coincided with the Stalinist  counter-revolution in Russia, which had a disastrous effect on the Communist  Parties of the entire world. The Stalinist bureaucracy, having acquired control  in the Soviet Union developed a very conservative outlook. The theory that  socialism can be built in one country&#8212;an abomination from the standpoint of  Marx and Lenin&#8212;really reflected the mentality of the bureaucracy which had had  enough of the storm and stress of revolution and sought to get on with the task  of &ldquo;building socialism in Russia&rdquo;. That is to say, they wanted to protect and  expand their privileges and not &ldquo;waste&rdquo; the resources of the country in pursuing  world revolution. On the other hand they feared that revolution in other  countries could develop on healthy lines and pose a threat to their own  domination in Russia, and therefore, at a certain stage, sought actively to  prevent revolution elsewhere.</p>
  <p>
        Instead of pursuing a revolutionary policy based on class independence, as  Lenin had always advocated, they proposed an alliance of the Communist Parties  with the &ldquo;national progressive bourgeoisie&rdquo; (and if there was not one easily at  hand, they were quite prepared to invent it) to carry through the democratic  revolution, and afterwards, later on, in the far distant future, when the  country had developed a fully fledged capitalist economy, fight for socialism.  This policy represented a complete break with Leninism and a return to the old  discredited position of Menshevism&#8212;the theory of the &ldquo;two stages&rdquo;.</p>
  <h4>
  <strong>Role of the Communist Parties</strong> </h4>
  <p>
        This theory was to play a criminal role in the development of the  revolution in the colonial world. In China the young Communist Party was forced  into the ranks of the national bourgeois Kuomintang which then proceeded to  liquidate physically the Communist Party, the trade unions and the peasant  soviets during the 1925-27 Chinese revolution. The reason why the second  Chinese revolution took the form of a peasant war in which the working class  remained passive was to a large extent determined by the crushing of the  Chinese proletariat as a result of Stalin&rsquo;s policies which Trotsky  characterised as &ldquo;a malicious caricature of Menshevism.&rdquo; Wherever it has been  applied in the colonial world, the Stalinist theory of the &ldquo;two stages&rdquo; has led  to one catastrophe after another.</p>
  <p>
        In Sudan and Iraq in the 1950s and 1960s, the Communist Parties were mass  forces able to call demonstrations of a million people in Baghdad and two  million in Khartoum. Instead of pursuing a policy of class independence and  leading the workers and peasants to the taking of power, they looked for  alliances with the &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; bourgeoisie and the &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; sections of  the army. The latter, having taken power on the backs of the Communist Parties,  then proceeded to eliminate them by murdering and jailing their members and  leaders. In Sudan, the same process happened not once but twice. Yet, even to  this day, the leaders of the Sudanese Communist Party have a policy of a &ldquo;Patriotic  Alliance&rdquo; with the guerrillas in the South (now backed by US imperialism) and  the &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; bourgeoisie in the North against the fundamentalist regime.  These so-called Communist leaders are like the Bourbons of old who &ldquo;forget  nothing and learn nothing.&rdquo; Their policies are a finished recipe for one bloody  defeat after another.</p>
  <p>
        The most tragic example of the disastrous consequences of the two stages  theory is that of Indonesia. In the 1960s the Indonesian Communist Party was  the main mass force in the country. It was the biggest Communist party in the  world outside the Soviet Bloc, with 3 million members, as well as 10 million  affiliated to its trade union and peasant organisations and even claimed the  support of 40 per cent of the army (including sections of the officers). The  Russian Bolsheviks did not have as much organised support at the time of the  October revolution! The Indonesian CP could have easily taken power and started  the socialist transformation of society which would have had a tremendous  effect in the whole of the colonial world, setting off a chain of revolutions  in Asia. Instead of that, the leaders of the CP (under the control of the  Chinese Maoists) had an alliance with Sukarno, a bourgeois nationalist leader  who at that time had adopted a &ldquo;left&rdquo; phraseology. Those policies left the  Communist Party completely unprepared when the bourgeoisie (under direct  instructions from the CIA) organised a massacre of Communist Party members and  sympathisers in which at least 1.5 million people were slaughtered. </p>
  <p>
        Despite all defeats and setbacks, the workers and peasants will inevitably  take the road of struggle time after time. The recent events in Indonesia are a  graphic indication of this fact. They are an anticipation of what will happen  in one Asian country after another. And this is only the beginning of a  revolutionary process that will unfold over a period of years. If a genuinely  Leninist party existed, this could end in a proletarian revolution on classical  lines. The question of guerrillaism or proletarian bonapartism would not arise.  Here, as always, the subjective factor is decisive. Unfortunately the  leaderships of the Communist parties in these countries are repeating all the  same old mistakes which led to defeat and slaughter in the past. Although Japan  is not a colonial country, it is worth noting the spectacular growth of the  Japanese Communist Party as a result of the country&rsquo;s economic crisis. The JCP  has became the first party in number of local councillors, is the second  biggest party in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly and its daily paper has a  circulation of 2.3 million.</p>
  <p>
        The wave of radicalisation that is sweeping through Asia has also affected  the Japanese working class. This year&rsquo;s May Day celebrations in Japan were the  biggest in years. No fewer than 2 million workers participated in rallies up  and down the country. This is a clear example of how consciousness can change  at lightning speed when conditions change. But unfortunately the policies of  the JCP leadership are completely remote from the real tasks facing the  Japanese working class. According to Kimitoshi Morihara, vice-head of the  Japanese Communist Party&rsquo;s international department, &ldquo;we work towards the establishment  of a democratic government which seeks to resolve these problems, within the  framework of capitalism, by early next century.&rdquo; (interview in Green Left  Weekly issue 317). They have perfected the old Stalinist two stage theory by  adding an extra stage! This is the &ldquo;perspective for social progress in Japan:  democratic coalition government, democratic revolution and socialist  revolution.&rdquo;(?). This is even more puzzling since, as Japan is already the  second industrial power on earth, one would imagine it could do without a &ldquo;democratic  revolution&rdquo;. It seems that any excuse will do to put the socialist revolution  off the agenda.</p>
  <p>
        For many decades the working class of the colonial and ex-colonial  countries has demonstrated its colossal courage and revolutionary potential.  Time and time again it has moved to carry out the revolutionary transformation  of society. In Iraq, Sudan, Iran, Chile, Argentina, India, Pakistan and  Indonesia, the workers have shown that they wished to be the masters of  society. If they failed, it is not because they could not have succeeded, but  because they lacked the indispensable prerequisite for taking power. In every  case, they beat their heads against a brick wall because the parties and  leaders that they trusted to lead them to the socialist transformation of  society became transformed into gigantic obstacles.</p>
  <p>
        In order to take power, it is not enough that the workers are prepared to  fight. If that were the case, the working class could have taken power in all  these countries long ago. It would have been easy, because they were in a far  stronger position than the Russian workers in 1917. But they did not take  power. Why not? Because the working class needs a party and a leadership. To  deny this elementary fact of life is mere childish anarchism. Marx explained  long ago that, without organisation, the working class is merely raw material  for exploitation. Despite its numerical strength and its key role in  production, the proletariat cannot transform society unless it becomes a class &ldquo;in-and-for-itself&rdquo;  with the necessary consciousness, perspectives and understanding. To wait until  the class as a whole possesses the necessary understanding of all that is  required to take power and transform society is an utopian proposition which is  tantamount to postponing the revolution indefinitely. It is necessary to  organise the most advanced layers of the class, to educate the cadres, and  imbue them with the perspective of revolution, not only on a national but on an  international scale, to integrate them in the masses at every level, and to  patiently prepare for the moment when the partial struggles of the masses  become combined into a general revolutionary offensive.</p>
  <p>
        Without a revolutionary party, the potential power of the proletariat will  remain just that &#8212;a potential. The relationship between the class and the  party is similar to that between steam and a piston box. But even the existence  of the party is not enough to ensure success. The party must be led by men and  women who are equipped with the necessary understanding of the tasks of the  revolution, of tactics, strategy and perspectives, not only the national but  also the international perspectives. The objective situation in Indonesia in  1964-65 could not have been more favourable. The masses had defeated Dutch  Imperialism. The Communists had the support of the overwhelming majority of the  working class and peasantry. But a false policy and perspective were sufficient  to bring about the total ruin of the revolution. If the October revolution  proves the correctness of the permanent revolution in a positive sense, the  Indonesian catastrophe furnishes us with a negative proof in the most terrible  way.</p>
  <p>
        The peculiar distorted way in which the colonial revolution has unfolded  since 1945 is not only the result of backwardness, or the delay of the  socialist revolution in the advanced capitalist countries. It was not something  inevitable and determined in advance by the laws of history. It was above all  the result of the absence of the subjective factor, of a genuine revolutionary  party and leadership which could have imparted an entirely different character  and direction to the revolution. Objectively speaking, there was nothing to  prevent the revolution in China, for example, from playing the same role as the  Russian revolution of 1917, on condition that the Chinese Communist leaders had  behaved like Lenin and Trotsky. But the Stalinist leaders feared the  independent movement of the working class and did everything in their power to  prevent it. The peculiar way in which the Chinese revolution came about in  1949, as a distorted revolution in the image of Stalin&rsquo;s Russia, meant that it  had little appeal to the workers of the advanced countries, although it gave an  important stimulus to the revolution in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The  same was true of the other regimes of proletarian bonapartism that came into  existence later. Although they undoubtedly represented a step forward, they  were really an aberration and a departure from the norm of proletarian  revolution established by Lenin and made reality in October 1917. This fact  must be firmly borne in mind if we are to understand the real significance of  the colonial revolution after 1945.</p>
  <h4>
  <strong>The Chinese revolution</strong> </h4>
  <p>
        From time to time it is necessary to draw a balance sheet of our ideas and  theoretical positions. How did they work out in practice over the past fifty  years? If there is a major contribution of our tendency to Marxism, this is our  analysis of the colonial revolution and the development of proletarian  bonapartism, beginning with our analysis of the Chinese revolution after 1945.  It was precisely the impasse of capitalism in these countries and the pressing  need of the masses for a way forward which gave rise to the phenomena of  proletarian bonapartism. This was due to a number of different factors. In the  first place, the complete impasse of society in the backward countries and the  inability of the colonial bourgeoisie to show a way forward. Secondly, the  inability of imperialism to maintain its control by the old means of direct  military-bureaucratic rule. Thirdly, the delay of the proletarian revolution in  the advanced capitalist countries and the weakness of the subjective factor.  And lastly, the existence of a powerful regime of proletarian bonapartism in  the Soviet Union.</p>
  <p>
        The victory of the USSR in the Second World War, and the strengthening of  Stalinism after the War with its extension to Eastern Europe and the victory of  the Chinese revolution were all factors that combined to condition the  development of proletarian bonapartism as a peculiar variant of the permanent  revolution which was only understood by our tendency. This was an entirely  unprecedented and unexpected phenomenon. Nowhere in the classics of Marxism was  it even considered as a theoretical possibility that a peasant war could lead  to the establishment of even a deformed workers&rsquo; state. Yet this is precisely  what occurred in China, and later in Cuba and Vietnam.</p>
  <p>
        We characterised the Chinese revolution as the second greatest event in  world history, after the Russian revolution of 1917. It had an enormous effect  in the subsequent development of the colonial revolution. But this revolution  did not take place on the classical lines of the Russian revolution in 1917 or  the Chinese revolution of 1925-27. The working class played no important role.  Mao came to power on the basis of a mighty peasant war, in the traditions of  China. The only way Mao was able to win the civil war of 1944-49 was by  offering a programme of social liberation to the peasant armies of Chiang  Kai-shek, who was armed and backed by American imperialism. But the Stalinist  leaders of the peasant Red Army had no perspective of leading the workers to  power as did Lenin and Trotsky in 1917. When Mao&rsquo;s peasant armies arrived at  the cities, and the workers spontaneously occupied the factories and greeted  Mao&rsquo;s armies with red flags, Mao gave the order that these demonstrations  should be suppressed and the workers were shot.</p>
  <p>
        Initially, Mao did not intend to expropriate the Chinese capitalists. His  perspectives for the Chinese revolution were outlined in a pamphlet called &ldquo;New  democracy&rdquo; in which he wrote that the socialist revolution was not on the order  of the day in China, and that the only development that could take place was a  mixed economy, i.e. capitalism. This was the classical &ldquo;two stage&rdquo; Menshevik  theory which had been adopted by the Stalinist bureaucracy and had led to the  defeat of the Chinese revolution in 1925-27. But our tendency understood that  under the concrete conditions that had developed that Mao would be forced to  expropriate capitalism.</p>
  <p>
        Not only that but we also predicted in advance the fact that Mao would be  forced to break with Stalin. Already in early 1949 we wrote: </p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;The fact that Mao  has a genuine mass base independent of the Russian Red Army, will in all  likelihood provide for the first time an independent base for Chinese Stalinism  which will no longer rest directly on Moscow. As with Tito, so with Mao,  despite the role of the Red Army in Manchuria, Chinese Stalinism is developing  an independent base. Because of the national aspirations of the Chinese masses,  the traditional struggle against foreign domination, the economic needs of the  country and above all, the powerful base in an independent state apparatus, the  danger of a new and really formidable Tito in China is a factor which is  causing anxiety in Moscow &hellip;</p>
  <p class="quote">
  &ldquo;However, the subordination of the Chinese economy to the benefit of the  Russian bureaucracy, with the attempts to place puppets in control who will be  completely subordinate to Moscow&#8212;in other words, the national oppression of  the Chinese&#8212;will create the basis for a clash with the Kremlin of great  magnitude and significance. Mao, with an independent and powerful state  apparatus, with the possibility of manoeuvring with the imperialists of the  West (who will seek to negotiate with China for trade and try and drive a wedge  between Peking and Moscow) and with the support of the Chinese masses as the  victorious leader against the Kuomintang, will have powerful points of support  against Moscow.</p>
  <p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Stalin&rsquo;s very efforts to try and forestall this development will tend to  accelerate and intensify the resentment and the conflict.&rdquo; (&ldquo;<a href="../../1949/james.htm">Reply to David James</a>&rdquo;,  reprinted in E. Grant, The Unbroken Thread, p. 304.)</p>
  <p>
        These lines were written more than a decade before the outbreak of the  Sino-Soviet conflict, when the Chinese and Russian bureaucracies seemed to be  inseparable allies.</p>
  <p>
        The victory of Mao&rsquo;s peasant armies in China was due to a number of  factors: the complete and utter impasse of Chinese capitalism and landlordism,  the inability of imperialism to intervene because of the war-weariness of the  imperialist troops after the Second World War, and also because of the colossal  power of attraction of the nationalised planned economy in Stalinist Russia  which demonstrated its superiority during the war with Hitler&rsquo;s Germany.</p>
  <p>
        The fact that the peasantry was used to carry through a social revolution  was a completely new development in the history of China. China was the  classical country of peasant wars, which took place at regular intervals. But  even when these wars were victorious this merely resulted in the fusion of the  leading elements of the peasant armies with the elite in the towns, resulting  in the formation of a new dynasty. It was a vicious circle which characterised  Chinese history for over 2,000 years. But here we had a fundamental departure.  The peasant army under Mao was able to smash capitalism and create a society on  the image of Stalin&rsquo;s Moscow. Of course, there could be no question of a  healthy workers&rsquo; state as in Russia in November 1917 being established by such  means. For that, the active participation and leadership of the working class  would be required. But a peasant army, without the leadership of the working  class, is the classical instrument of Bonapartism, not workers&rsquo; power. The  Chinese Revolution of 1949 began where the Russian Revolution had ended. There  was no question of soviets or workers&rsquo; democracy. From the very beginning it  was a monstrously deformed workers&rsquo; state. Our tendency underlined that on the  world scale the only class which can bring about the triumph of socialism is  the proletariat.</p>
  <p>
        Once Mao had taken power and created a state apparatus on the basis of the  hierarchy of the Red Army he did not have any need to ally himself with the  bourgeoisie. In a typical bonapartist fashion, Mao balanced between the  different classes. He leaned on the peasantry and to a certain extent on the  working class to expropriate the capitalists, but once these had been defeated  he then proceeded to eliminate any elements of workers democracy that might  have existed. This phenomena was possible precisely because of the delay of the  world revolution and the impasse of society. He had the powerful example of  Stalinism in Russia, where a strong bureaucracy was parasiting the planned  economy and benefiting from it, so he decided to follow the same model. Despite  its monstrously deformed character, the Chinese Revolution nevertheless  represented a gigantic step forward for hundreds of millions of people who had  been the beasts of burden of imperialism.</p>
  <h4>
  <strong>Proletarian bonapartism</strong> </h4>
  <p>
        In working out the processes that occurred in the colonial revolution in the  period after the Second World War, we took as our basic starting point Trotsky&rsquo;s  theory of the permanent revolution, which, as we have seen, has been  brilliantly confirmed by history. But in practice theories do not necessarily  work out in a pure, chemically distilled way. There can be all kinds of  peculiar variants, distortions and departures from the norm. This can be seen  in all sorts of ways.</p>
  <p>
        The classical period of the bourgeois-democratic revolution commenced two  or even three hundred years ago with the revolutions in Holland, England and  France. Marx took the French revolution of 1789-93 as his model for the  bourgeois-democratic revolution in the political sense (while England provided  the economic model). But there were always exceptions to the classical norm,  for example, Germany, where the basic tasks of the bourgeois-democratic  revolution were carried out in a peculiar way, from the top, by the old feudal  Junker state under Bismarck. Of course, there were many contradictions and  elements left over from feudalism which were only cleared away by the  revolution of November 1918&#8212;a defeated proletarian revolution, in which the  workers overthrew the old state, and then the Social Democratic leaders handed  power over to the bourgeoisie. Similarly in Japan, it was the old feudal state  that began the process of the bourgeois-democratic revolution in the 1860s,  under the pressure of external forces, and the process was only completed by  the American occupying forces after 1945, in an attempt to prevent revolution  in Japan.</p>
  <p>
        The phenomenon of proletarian bonapartism bears a similar relation to the  theory of permanent revolution as do the processes that took place in Germany  and Japan to the classical norm of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, that is  as aberrations that arose from a specific historical concatenation of  circumstances. This phenomenon can only be understood on the basis of the  complete impasse of these societies and the delay of the revolution in the  West. The masses in the colonial countries could not wait any longer. That is  the fundamental explanation. But we must also take into consideration the  specific peculiarities of the colonial and ex-colonial countries, which make  them different from the advanced countries of capitalism, and therefore permit  certain peculiar variants which were not foreseen by the classics of Marxism.  We refer here specifically to the state.</p>
  <p>
        Marxism would be a very simple affair if it were merely a question of  learning by rote the elementary formulas derived from the classical texts and  applying these in a thoughtless and mechanical fashion to each and every  situation. The dialectical method demands that we proceed from an objective  consideration of the given phenomena, taking each case in its concreteness and  regarding it from all points of view. A serious analysis of the colonial and  ex-colonial states reveals profound differences with the type of state that  exists in the developed capitalist nations and which provided the basic model  for the classical works of Engels and Lenin. These had been created and  perfected by the bourgeoisie as a tool for its rule. At every level these  states were staffed by loyal representatives formed and trained to serve its  interests. Above all these advanced industrial countries could develop the  productive forces. But the newly-formed states in these countries were  completely different from the ones created and developed over generations by  the bourgeoisie in the West. In places like Syria or Burma these societies were  in an impasse, could not develop the productive forces and were in complete  turmoil.</p>
  <p>
        It is an elementary proposition of Marxism that the state is not an  independent force, that it must reflect the interests of a group or class  within society. In normal times they reflect the position of the ruling class.  But in periods of crisis and social instability the state and the army are  split and divided in numerous factions. The states which had been created on  the basis of the withdrawal of imperialism, although bourgeois in character,  were very weak. In these countries&#8212;Burma, Syria, Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia,  Somalia, Afghanistan and other states which moved to proletarian  bonapartism&#8212;the state was subjected to continuous coups and crisis. With the  complete impasse of the regime and the delay of the revolution in the West, the  example of Stalinism, which at this stage was developing the productive forces,  became an irresistible force of attraction for certain layers within the  apparatus of the state.</p>
  <p>
        The example of China reinforced the attraction of Stalinism as a way  forward not only for the masses of poor peasants in former colonial countries,  but also for sections of the state apparatus in these countries. A whole series  of states which were in a situation of collapse and disintegration, moved in  the direction of proletarian bonapartism. Sections of the officer caste rested  on the working class and the peasants to carry through a revolution, to  overthrow capitalism and landlordism. They saw Stalinism as a regime which was  taking society forward but at the same time allowed for a bureaucratic caste to  have privileges and run society. This was the process especially in the most  backward of the colonial countries like Ethiopia, Angola, Afghanistan, etc.,  where the proletariat was (and still is) very weak or almost non-existent.</p>
  <p>
        Another important factor in the movement towards proletarian bonapartism in  all these countries was the world-wide tendency towards statisation. This  phenomenon was already dealt with by Engels, who refers to the &ldquo;invading  socialist economy&rdquo; and later by Lenin, who described it as state monopoly  capitalism. The fact that private ownership of the means of production has  reached its limits is expressed by the fact that in all capitalist countries  large sections of the economy are in the hands of the state, although, of  course, the key elements, the most profitable sectors remain in private hands.  The state sector did not play an independent role, but merely served as the  handmaiden of the private sector, providing the capitalists with cheap steel,  cheap electricity, cheap coal, etc. </p>
  <p>
        The same process affected the third world, not only in the regimes of  proletarian bonapartism, but even in the relatively more developed bourgeois  states like Argentina, Mexico, India, etc. Many of these bourgeois leaders  described themselves as &ldquo;socialists&rdquo; (like Nasser in Egypt, Nyerere in  Tanzania, Nehru in India and Nkrumah in Ghana) and nationalised large sections  of the economy. In cases such as Syria, Ethiopia and others, a section of the  officer caste actually carried the process to a conclusion, leaning on the  working class to expropriate the bourgeoisie entirely. They established regimes  in the image of Moscow and Beijing, in which capitalism was abolished but the  workers were subjected to a new tyranny in the form of bureaucratic one-party  totalitarian regimes. Of course, such regimes had nothing in common with  socialism or even a healthy workers&rsquo; state. In every case where the historical  tasks of one class have been carried through in a distorted way by another  class, there is always a price to be paid. We explained that, in order to  advance in the direction of socialism, a new revolution would be necessary. Not  a social revolution to establish new property relations (since this had already  been done), but a political revolution against the ruling bureaucratic caste in  order to establish a genuine regime of workers&rsquo; democracy. Nevertheless, the  abolition of landlordism and capitalism in these countries represented a step  forward and a blow against imperialism and, as such, was welcomed by the  Marxists.</p>
  <p>
        In most if not all of these cases, Moscow and Beijing played no role. More  often than not, they were opposed to the overthrow of capitalism, and did what  they could to prevent it. The Cuban CP supported Batista against Castro. Later,  the Russian and Cuban bureaucracies put pressure on the sandinistas not to  carry through the expropriation of capitalism in Nicaragua. Of course, where  the process took place anyway, they took advantage of it to improve their own  position vis-a-vis US imperialism. This was also the case in Afghanistan, where  the Stalinist army officers carried through the revolution from the top,  without any reference to Moscow. The Russian bureaucracy had very good relations  with the bourgeois regime of Doud in Kabul, and were even prepared to sacrifice  the CP to the latter. But once the revolution was a fact, they had to accept  it.</p>
  <p>
        The imperialists responded to the revolution in Afghanistan by arming and  financing groups of bandits and lumpens which waged war against the new regime.  Had the latter pursued the same policies as the Bolsheviks, basing themselves  on the masses in the struggle against imperialism and reaction, they might have  won, although it must be admitted that in conditions of such terrible  backwardness even a healthy workers&rsquo; state would have faced enormous  difficulties. It would have been necessary to proceed gradually and with great  caution, especially on the question of religion. But the attempt to foist  change on society from the top, in a heavy-handed bureaucratic character,  reinforced by the Russian invasion and the monstrous purging and in-fighting  that resulted, fatally weakened the revolution in the face of the concerted  onslaught of the counterrevolutionary forces backed by America and Pakistan.</p>
  <p>
        A similar process occurred in Africa, where the imperialists utilised the  services of South Africa to overthrow the proletarian bonapartist regimes in  Angola and Mozambique. As in Afghanistan, they armed and financed an army of  mercenary cut-throats and bandits. This was not a political struggle, but  merely the mobilisation of the &ldquo;Dark Forces&rdquo; to murder, burn, rape and pillage.  Imperialism could not tolerate the existence of even deformed workers&rsquo; states in  the heart of Africa because of the example it would represent for South Africa.  Rather than see this happen, they preferred to plunge Angola, Mozambique and  Afghanistan into the dark ages.</p>
  <h4>
  <strong>Are new regimes of proletarian bonapartism  possible?</strong> </h4>
  <p>
        Basing ourselves on this analysis, what are the possibilities for the  formation of new regimes of proletarian bonapartism? In order to answer this  question, it is necessary to proceed from general world perspectives. The  world-wide tendency towards the intervention of the state in the economy was  reversed after the 1974 slump and turned into its opposite, especially since  the process of privatisations started by Thatcher in the 80s. This reflects the  impasse of capitalism on a world scale and the bankruptcy of the old model of  Keynesianism. The colonial countries have been largely forced through the  dictates of the IMF and the World Bank to &ldquo;open up&rdquo; their markets and privatise  the nationalised industries. This is really a looting of the state. It will  have far-reaching consequences in the next period. Far from being an advance as  they try to claim, it is an expression of the crisis of capitalism. They have  created a whole new language (&ldquo;downsizing&rdquo;, &ldquo;liberalisation&rdquo;, &ldquo;opening up of  the markets&rdquo;, &ldquo;freeing the economy&rdquo;, etc.) to cover up for what is really a  massive destruction of productive forces and jobs. This reminds one of the &ldquo;Newspeak&rdquo;  of George Orwell&rsquo;s 1984, where the Ministry of Plenty presides over shortages,  the Ministry of Peace is the Ministry of War, and the Ministry of Love is the  secret police.</p>
  <p>
        The advocates of the &ldquo;free market&rdquo; conveniently forget that capitalism  developed precisely on the basis of high tariff barriers and protectionism. In  the early phase of capitalism British capitalism sheltered behind high trade  barriers in order to defend its own national nascent industries. Only when its  industry became strong did the British bourgeoisie become a fervent advocate of  the &ldquo;principle&rdquo; of free trade. The same was true of France, Germany, America,  Japan and all the others who now preach the virtues of free trade to the  nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America. But this process creates new  contradictions. Sections of the state apparatus and the national bourgeoisie  see how this cuts their own share of the cake and also fear an explosion on the  part of the masses. This leads some of them to oppose (at least in words)  imperialism, for fear of losing their position&#8212;or even their own heads.</p>
  <p>
        This is the case with the Nigerian junta, which is opposing some of the  privatisation plans of the IMF. Sections of the ruling PRI in Mexico are  starting to make noises against &ldquo;neo-liberalism&rdquo; because they see how it erodes  their traditional base of bureaucratic control in society. Even Mobutu, Zaire&rsquo;s  dictator, opposed privatisation in his last days in power&#8212; a policy obviously  not dictated by any desire to alleviate the burden of the population, but in  order to defend his own vested interests. Already, as a result of the crisis in  South East Asia we see the development of protectionist, anti-Western attitudes  in some of these countries. This is the case in South Korea and even on the  part of Suharto, who in his last days, like Mobutu, clashed with the IMF. The  same is true of the &ldquo;anti-imperialist&rdquo; demagogy of Mohathir in Malaysia. This  is no accident. Since the collapse in Asia, the imperialists have moved swiftly  to buy up property at bargain prices and force the Asian economies to accept an  even more humiliating dependence than before. These are just some indications  of the fact that the ruthless exploitation of the former colonial countries  through the IMF and the World Bank is preparing a massive backlash against the  policies of privatisation, &ldquo;globalisation&rdquo; and so on. Even in the West we can  see the beginnings of mass movements against the cuts in the Welfare state and  privatisation. In the next period we will see a massive swing in the opposite  direction, especially with the coming world economic slump.</p>
  <p>
        It is necessary to have a dialectical understanding of the process, not  merely accept the &ldquo;accomplished fact&rdquo; as something fixed for all time. It is  precisely the empiricism of the bourgeois and its strategists which blinds them  to the real processes and compels them to stagger on along the path leading  inexorably to disaster. In pursuit of short-term gains, they are provoking the  masses in Asia&#8212;and the ex-colonial world in general&#8212;to the limits of their  endurance. At a certain point, the whole process we have seen in the last  decade or so will be thrown into reverse. Therefore we can conclude that in the  next period, given the impasse of capitalism in the colonial countries, the  backlash against privatisation and the pressing needs of the masses in these  countries, we will witness new movements in the direction of proletarian  bonapartism. This will be the case especially in the weakest of these  countries. The outcome of the process of capitalist restoration in Russia and  China will, of course, have an enormous effect on these developments one way or  another. But that is a separate question. Sufficient to say that, in the event  of a deep slump on a world scale, the plans for capitalist restoration in these  countries will inevitably be thrown back into the melting pot. It is entirely  possible that the first candidate for a reversion to some form of proletarian  bonapartism could be Russia itself. That perspective depends on the entire  course of developments in Russia and on a world scale. We must be prepared for  all eventualities, while fighting for the cause of workers&rsquo; power, in order not  to be taken by surprise by events.</p>
  <h4><strong>The Cuban Revolution </strong> </h4>
  <p>
The extension of proletarian bonapartism in the colonial world also raised  another issue&#8212; that of the role of the peasantry in the revolution. For a  whole period it looked as if the classical analysis of Marxism concerning the  leading role of the proletariat in the revolution had been falsified by  history. Practically every other tendency with the exception of ourselves  accepted the new-fangled theories of guerrilla warfare. We were the only ones  to explain that no other class other than the proletariat can lead to the  establishment of a healthy workers state.</p>
  <p>
As we have pointed out, no reference or hint at the possibility that the  peasantry can bring about a socialist revolution can be found in the writings  of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky. The reason for that is the extreme  heterogeneity of the peasantry as a class. It is divided into many layers, from  the landless labourers (who are really rural proletarians) to the rich peasants  who employ other peasants as wage labourers. They do not have a common interest  and therefore cannot play an independent role in society. Historically they  have supported different classes or groups in the cities. The only class able  to lead a successful socialist revolution is the working class. This is not for  sentimental reasons but because the place it occupies in society and the  collective character of its role in production.</p>
  <p>
Marxists have always conceived the peasant war as an auxiliary of the  workers in the struggle for power. That position was first developed by Marx  during the German revolution of 1848, when he argued that the German revolution  could only triumph as a second edition of the Peasants&rsquo; War. That is to say,  the movement of the workers in the towns would have to draw behind it the  peasant masses. The Bolsheviks also explained that it was the workers in the  cities who had to lead the peasants behind them. It is important to note that  during the Russian revolution the industrial working class represented no more  than 10 per cent of the population. Yet the proletariat played the leading role  in the Russian revolution, drawing behind itself the multi-millioned mass of  poor peasants&#8212;the natural ally of the proletariat.</p>
  <p>
This perspective seemed to be falsified after the Second World War when a  number of guerrilla wars ended up in victory in Cuba, Vietnam, Angola,  Mozambique, etc. The Cuban revolution was yet another peculiar case, though in  its essentials it was similar to China. It is not generally realised that  Castro started out as a bourgeois-democrat. His model was the American  Revolution of 1776! But then Mao also originally had the perspective of a long  period of capitalist development in China. In both cases the logic of the  situation dictated the outcome which was different to that envisaged by the  leadership.</p>
  <p>
Having smashed the old Batista state (against the advice of the Cuban CP  who condemned Castro as a petty bourgeois adventurer), Castro found himself in  an entirely unforeseen position. He attempted to introduce reforms and tax the  US companies, who replied with a campaign of sabotage, although the taxes they  were being asked to pay in Cuba were less than in the USA. Washington began a  blockade of Cuba. In reply, Castro seized all the US assets in Cuba. Since  nine-tenths of the economy was owned by US imperialism, this meant that  practically the whole economy was nationalised, so they decided to finish the  job and nationalised the remaining ten percent. With the model of Moscow before  them, the Cuban leaders manoeuvred to set up a proletarian bonapartist regime.</p>
  <p>
The Cuban revolution acted as a beacon to the oppressed workers and  peasants of Central and Latin America. In several countries, there were  attempts to follow the Cuban road of guerrilla warfare, but, despite its  initial attraction, especially to the student youth, it failed everywhere, with  catastrophic results. Our tendency explained that many of these victories were  achieved not by the guerrilla war itself but by the workers declaring general  strikes in the cities as the decisive factor. That was the case in Cuba and  also in Nicaragua. We also explained that a guerrilla war, even if victorious,  could at most lead to a deformed (proletarian bonapartist) workers&rsquo; state. The  very nature of the organisation of a guerrilla army does not allow a democratic  structure and the lack of participation of the workers in the overthrowing of  the regime in an organised way meant that the hierarchy of the guerrilla army  would form the new state bureaucracy.</p>
  <p>
Therefore, our tendency, while giving critical support to the different  guerrilla movements, as an expression of the struggle of the peoples against  oppression, insisted that the main factor was the conscious organisation of the  working class to change society. The working class in almost all of the  countries where guerrilla wars developed was at least as big as it was during  the Russian revolution in 1917, and much bigger as a proportion to the total  population. Under the leadership of a genuine Leninist party, the workers could  carry out a classical proletarian revolution on the lines of the October  revolution, in all but the most backward of countries. Moreover, in many, if  not most, of these countries, the majority of the population now lives in urban  areas. The working class is numerically far stronger than was the case in  Russia in 1917. Only the lack of the subjective factor&#8212;a revolutionary party  and leadership&#8212;has prevented this from coming about.</p>
  <p>
All the so-called &ldquo;Trotskyist&rdquo; groups at the time started to defend  guerrilla war in the Third World as the only means for a socialist revolution.  They even went so far as to declare guerrilla war as the main tactic even in  countries where the peasantry did not represent a sizeable section of the  population, developing the crazy idea of &ldquo;urban guerrillaism&rdquo; which lead to the  destruction of a whole generation of revolutionary youth in countries like  Argentina, Uruguay and others.</p>
  <p>
The organic opportunism of the CP leaders, their embracing of the  bourgeoisie under the banner of the &ldquo;two stages&rdquo; theory, pushed a large section  of the student youth in the direction of adventurism&#8212;individual terrorism and  guerrillaism&#8212;in search of a short cut. This led to a catastrophe in Latin  America, where these tactics led to the massacre of an entire generation of  young revolutionary cadres and, ultimately, to the nightmare of military  dictatorships in Argentina and Uruguay. Criminally, the so-called Trotskyists  not only did not combat these tendencies, but actively encouraged them and even  participated in them. This fact shows just how far the degeneration of these  people had gone. Ideas that had already been discredited in the prehistory of the  movement now re-emerged from the dust-bin of history, parading as something new  and original. But Russian Marxism was born in struggle against all forms of  individual terrorism and &ldquo;guerrillaism&rdquo;. Such methods must lead to defeat, but  even if they succeed, they cannot lead to the establishment of a healthy  workers&rsquo; state, but only a bureaucratic caricature.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>Guerrilla war</strong> </h4>
  <p>
The failure of the guerrillas in El Salvador and Guatemala showed the  limitations of this tactic. Whereas the Cuban revolution took the imperialists  by surprise, they were better prepared to deal with the problem elsewhere. Even  so, with a correct policy and tactics, the revolution could have succeeded in  El Salvador, where conditions existed at the outset for a mass movement in the  towns. The petty bourgeois leadership was infatuated with the idea of guerrilla  warfare and led the movement to a bloody defeat. In Nicaragua, the sandinistas  had been waging guerrilla war for decades with no result. What decided the  issue was not the guerrillas but the fact that there was a mass insurrection  and a general strike in Managua.</p>
  <p>
Here again we see the counter-revolutionary role of Stalinism. The  sandinistas could easily have gone to the end and carried through the socialist  revolution. Of course, in a small country like Nicaragua, they could not have  held out for long. But herein lies the central point of the permanent  revolution. The Central American revolution is, in reality, a single whole.  Having taken power in Nicaragua, the sandinistas should then have appealed to  the workers and peasants of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica to  follow their example. Above all, it was necessary to spread the revolution to  Mexico. The Nicaraguan revolution will conquer as part of the revolution in Central  and South America or not at all. Probably the sandinista leaders would have  been prepared to carry the revolution through to the end by abolishing  capitalism in Nicaragua. But they were prevented from doing this by pressure  from Moscow and Havana. The Russian and Cuban bureaucracies, motivated by  narrow national considerations, did not want to provoke Washington and  persuaded the sandinistas to halt the revolution half-way. This was a disaster  for the revolution. The US imperialists organised and armed the  counterrevolutionary Contras and slowly throttled the Nicaraguan revolution.</p>
  <p>
The imperialists have learned the lesson of guerrilla wars and seek to  destroy them at an early stage. In the last period a number of different  guerrilla groups have abandoned their tactics and reached agreements to  participate in civilian politics. But this has been more as a result of the  demoralisation of their Stalinist-leaning leaders rather than a genuine  solution of the problems which gave rise to guerrilla war in the first place.  We can see how in countries like El Salvador or Guatemala, the army-organised  death squads still operate freely and the problem of the land is far from being  resolved. Therefore the possibility of new outbreaks of guerrilla war is still  present in the situation. In Nicaragua for example different groups have taken  arms again when the promises for land and cheap credits to work in them were  not fulfilled by the government.</p>
  <p>
The fact that the guerrillas have given up in a number of countries does not  rule out the possibility of new guerrilla outbreaks. On the contrary. They are  inevitable in the next period, and may even end in victory in some cases. The  same factors that led to guerrilla wars in the past are still present. The  desperate situation of the peasantry in most of the colonial countries, the  need to liquidate the remains of the feudal system of land property which still  exists in many places&#8212;all these factors make new guerrilla wars inevitable. A  clear indication of this was given by the emergence of the zapatista army  (EZLN) in Chiapas, Mexico in 1994. In the absence of a genuine revolutionary  alternative, there is a danger that a layer of the youth will be inclined to  resort to the methods of guerrillaism and terrorism. Yet the EZLN is a good  example of the need for the peasant movement to link up with the labour  movement in the cities. Every time the Mexican army has tried to go in and  smash the zapatistas the mass demonstrations in the cities have stopped them.  The programme of the EZLN is at best a bourgeois-democratic programme, but even  their limited demands cannot be achieved within the limits of capitalism. This  is a confirmation of the theory of the permanent revolution. The lack of  alternatives on the part of the EZLN leaders has allowed the government to go  on the offensive and try to dismantle the different &ldquo;autonomous municipalities&rdquo;  under zapatista control one by one.</p>
  <p>
The leaders of the EZLN do not have a programme which could appeal to the  workers and their efforts to go beyond their basis of support amongst the  peasants have been oriented mainly to the petty-bourgeois intellectuals and  middle classes in the cities. We must remember that in Mexico today, 70 per  cent of the population live in urban areas. The key to the revolution in  Mexico, and in the rest of Latin America lies, not in the peasantry, but in the  multi-millioned ranks of the labour movement.</p>
  <p>
In Colombia, the guerrilla movement is not only still active but controls  some 60 per cent of the country&rsquo;s territory and continues to advance. It is not  ruled out that they could take power. US imperialism is so worried about this  prospect that it is sending military advisers to the country. Let us remember  that this is just how the US involvement in Vietnam started in the early 1960s.  The analogy has already been made by bourgeois observers. Ever since the  Vietnam war, US imperialism has tried to avoid committing ground troops in  foreign conflicts, preferring to rely upon air bombardment. But wars cannot be  won by bombing alone. It is possible that, if the Colombian guerrillas look  like coming to power, the US involvement will escalate, as it did in Vietnam.  Such a development would have incalculable results in the whole of Central and  Latin America, and in the USA itself. That is just what Trotsky meant when he  spoke of dynamite being incorporated into the foundations of US imperialism as  a result of its role as world policeman in the epoch of imperialist decay.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>Interimperialist contradictions</strong> </h4>
  <p>
One important effect of the fall of Stalinism has been the intensification  of interimperialist contradictions. In the past they were to some extent united  against the common enemy of Stalinism, but now that this has disappeared&#8212;at  least for the time being. The conflicting interests of the different  imperialist powers have come to the fore. The division of the whole world into  three giant blocs continues apace. The EU, dominated by Germany with France as  a junior &ldquo;partner&rdquo; is busy carving out spheres of influence in Eastern and  Central Europe, and also has a whole series of semi-colonies in North Africa,  Africa and the Caribbean. The USA is attempting to increase its stranglehold on  Central and South America, and at the same time is asserting its dominant  influence on a world scale. This sometimes brings it into conflict with its  European and Japanese &ldquo;allies&rdquo;, as we have seen. For reasons we have already  explained in other documents, under modern conditions, a world war between the  major powers is ruled out. But &ldquo;small&rdquo; wars in the Third World involving  surrogate armies from client states will take place continuously. </p>
  <p>
The bourgeois press invariably tries to present wars and conflicts in these  countries as &ldquo;racial&rdquo; or &ldquo;ethnically motivated&rdquo;. As a matter of fact, poverty,  caused by the ruthless over-exploitation of these countries by imperialism, is  one of the main factors sparking these conflicts and wars. Another one is the  divide and rule policy of the old imperialist masters and the artificially  drawn border of these countries. Eight of the 10 most indebted countries have  suffered civil war or violent conflict since 1990. Of the 25 most indebted  countries, 15 suffer from such conflicts. In some countries, notably, but not  exclusively, in sub-Saharan Africa, we are witnessing the destruction of the  very structures of society and the state and the reappearance of elements of  barbarism. Countries devastated by decades of imperialist pillage and looting  in which armed gangs of people rule in a permanent state of in-fighting and the  bourgeois state has collapsed. These is the case mainly in those countries  where the working class has always been extremely weak. As examples of this  phenomena it is sufficient to recall Somalia, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan.</p>
  <p>
The imperialists are fighting bitterly for every market and every strategic  position in the world arena. This gives rise to enormous instability and  produces a situation far more similar to that of the turn of the century than  the long period of relative stability in international relations in the half  century that followed the Second World War. This can be seen clearly in Africa  where we are witnessing the struggle between a decaying imperialist power  (France) and a rising power with few previous interests in the continent (the  USA). This inter-imperialist conflict has been an important underlying factor  in the wars in the Central Lakes region in Africa, in the former Zaire, in  Congo-Brazzaville, in Sudan, etc. Thus, Uganda has become one of the important  pawns of Washington in the region helping Washington to win positions in  Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire which have, in effect, switched to the US sphere of  influence. France was the loser in this conflict.</p>
  <p>
In Sudan we can see a combined campaign of US-backed countries (Uganda,  Rwanda, Ethiopia) to oust the Islamic government in the North by supporting the  guerrillas in the South. France, once again, finds itself on the wrong side of  the equation. But the most startling example of the great imperialist powers  fighting over natural resources over the dead bodies of thousands of ordinary  people was, without doubt, the war in Congo-Brazzaville during the Summer of  1997. This was a war openly fought between French and US oil companies (with  the backing of the governments of Paris and Washington and their allies in the  area) for the control of the country&rsquo;s oil resources. A few months after, the  country was almost completely destroyed, 10,000 people had died, and the French  oil company Elf had regained its contracts over the Congo&rsquo;s resources. This  same conflict of interests is repeated all over the world. France, Russia and  the USA are fighting over the oil in the Middle East (especially in Iraq), and  in Central Asia. Afghanistan is still being torn apart by rival factions, each  of which is backed by one or another foreign power&#8212;Pakistan, Iran, Saudi  Arabia, Russia, the USA. The whole of Asia is the arena of a vast struggle for  markets by all the main imperialist powers.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>Imperialism forced to retreat</strong> </h4>
  <p>
For the imperialist powers direct military domination in the colonial world  had by 1945 become too expensive. Even before the Second World War, Trotsky  explained that the cost of direct imperialist domination of the colonial world  was greater than the tribute that they received in exploitation. However, many  of the imperialist countries were reluctant to withdraw from these countries  and therefore there were mass movements in South East Asia against French and  US imperialism; in Africa (Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria) against British  imperialism and against French imperialism in Algeria. But even where  independence was granted, it did not solve the problems of the masses in these  countries. This independence was only formal, as the imperialist domination  continued through, more subtle, economic means.</p>
  <p>
This domination is mainly exercised through the mechanism of the world  market and the unequal terms of trade, where commodities which represent more  labour are exchanged for commodities which represent less labour. Imperialism  forced many of these countries into monocrop economies, whether it consists of  agricultural products, like coffee, cocoa, bananas, cotton, etc., or minerals  like copper, diamonds, tin, etc. The prices of these products are heavily  controlled by a few multinationals and the general tendency has been going down  for decades. At the same time, the prices of manufactured products bought in  exchange have been rising creating a vicious circle from which it is impossible  to escape. It is not a coincidence that the Rwandan crisis was preceded by a  steep fall in prices of coffee. This ruined thousands of mainly Hutu peasants  who moved to the cities where they became fodder for the gangs who organised  the genocide. Prices of raw materials and agricultural products are now lower  in real terms than they were 70 years ago during the Great Depression.</p>
  <p>
The whole history of the world since 1945 only serves to confirm the theory  of the permanent revolution, which was already demonstrated by the Russian  Revolution itself. Let us not forget that, before 1917, tsarist Russia was an  extremely backward, semi-feudal and semi-colonial country (its complete  dependence on foreign imperialism was not altered by the fact that it was also  itself a weak imperialist power.) As early as 1904, Trotsky explained the basic  inability of the bourgeoisie to solve any of the problems facing Russian  society. This is true of the national bourgeoisie of all the former colonial  countries in the era of imperialist domination. For this reason, in the Second  Congress of the Communist International, Lenin insisted in rejecting the phrase  &ldquo;bourgeois-democratic revolution&rdquo;, replacing it with the slogan of the  national-democratic revolution. This was to underline the rottenness of the  colonial bourgeoisie, its utter inability to play any progressive role in the modern  epoch. This is most clearly shown by the case of India.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>India </strong> </h4>
  <p>
For over half a century, the Indian bourgeoisie has had plenty of time to  show what it is capable of. And now it stands condemned before history. Fifty  years after independence, despite the colossal productive capacity of India,  the Indian bourgeoisie has not been able to solve any of the urgent problems of  the country. Although there has been a certain development of industry (India  now has more industry than Britain), India is today as dependent on imperialism  as it was when it achieved formal independence, and the problems of the land,  the national question and even the caste system remain unsolved.</p>
  <p>
The Indian bourgeoisie was only able to rule after independence because of  the policies of the Communist Party which declared a truce during the struggle  for independence. The same anti-Leninist policy of the &ldquo;two stages&rdquo; was pursued  by all the CPs in the colonial world: support the &ldquo;progressive national  bourgeois&rdquo; against imperialism, relegating the fight for socialism to the dim  and distant future. In reality, India achieved formal independence as part of  the process of the mass movements of the colonial people&rsquo;s which took place in  the period after the Second World War. This was probably the biggest movement  of the peoples in the whole of history. The multi-million masses of the  colonial countries fought against imperialism and defeated it in most of the  cases winning independence.</p>
  <p>
The Congress Party under Nehru proclaimed itself to be both secular and &ldquo;socialist&rdquo;.  Yet half a century later, we see the victory of Hindu fundamentalism in the  form of the reactionary BJP. This is the price that India has paid for the rule  of the bourgeoisie. The main responsibility lies with the leaders of the pro-Moscow  CPI and pro-Beijing CPI (M) who had an agreement with Congress (the &ldquo;two stages&rdquo;  again). Yet it was not Congress but the millions of Indian workers and peasants  who freed India from British rule. For 300 years the British had ruled India  with Indian troops. Once the Indian people stood up and said no, the British  realised that the game was up. General Auckinlech telegraphed London to say  that he could hold India for no more than four days. Moreover Congress betrayed  India by accepting the bloody and reactionary partition in which anything  between 10 and 20 million people were slaughtered. This was a crime of British  imperialism which, under the pretext of &ldquo;preventing bloodshed&rdquo;, cynically  divided the living body of India, thus sowing the seeds of new wars and  conflicts.</p>
  <p>
The fall of Stalinism meant important changes for the colonial world. In  the past the colonial countries had the opportunity of balancing between the  USA and the USSR and get some advantages out of it. This is no longer the case.  This has decisively affected countries like India, which in the past, relying  to a certain extent on their trade and political links with the Moscow  bureaucracy, achieved a relative independence from Washington. Now that is no  longer the case. Under the pressure of imperialism India is being ruthlessly  forced to open up its markets, with catastrophic consequences for local  industry. The same picture can be seen all over the ex-colonial world. The  dreams of progress through independence have been exposed as a cruel fraud.  Under the capitalist system, the winning of formal independence&#8212;though in  itself a progressive development&#8212;can solve none of the most fundamental  problems of society in backward countries.</p>
  <p>
At present, 70 per cent of India&rsquo;s budget goes on debt repayment, and now  the BJP government has announced a big increase in arms expenditure. This will  impose new and harsh burdens on the shoulders of the workers and peasants, who  will soon see the BJP government for what it is. As The Economist sarcastically  put it, the BJP&rsquo;s slogan of &ldquo;self-reliance&rdquo; really means: &ldquo;You had better get  used to being poor.&rdquo; As a result, already the BJP government is beginning to  come apart at the seams. In the first of June budget announced shortly after  the nuclear test, the government announced big cuts in fertiliser subsidies and  raised fuel prices to market levels. But so weak is the coalition that when  opposition parties protested, Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha immediately  backed down, reducing the subsidy cut by one half and dropping the fuel price  increases, saying that they were &ldquo;mistakes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
Since then, the stock exchange has fallen by 30 percent, the rupee has  fallen 7 percent against the dollar, and, in the first week of June alone, $130  million worth of foreign investments left India. And this is before sanctions  have begun to take effect. According to some estimates, sanctions could cut  India&rsquo;s growth to 4 percent, far too weak to create the jobs needed to combat  unemployment. And inflation, which was only 4.5 percent, could rise to 10  percent. Thus, the BJP will preside over a rise in unemployment and prices and  a further fall in living standards. Once the fog of chauvinism whipped up over  the nuclear test has blown away&#8212;and this has already begun to happen&#8212;the stage  will be set for big movements. If the CPI and CPI (M) had a genuine communist  programme, the future of the Indian revolution would be assured. Unfortunately,  both parties are pursuing a reformist line, based on pacts and alliances with  different sections of the national bourgeoisie. On this road lies only the  perspective of defeat and reaction. In the course of struggle, the Indian  workers, beginning with the most conscious sections of the CPI and CPI (M),  will have to find the road to a real Leninist policy which can alone guarantee  success.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>Pakistan</strong> </h4>
  <p>
For 26 out of the last 51 years, Pakistan has been under army rule. It has  staggered from unstable democratic regimes to dictatorship and back again,  without solving any of the problems. On the contrary, the problems have got  steadily worse. The majority of the budget goes on defence spending and debt  repayment. The IMF is demanding a reduction in military spending&#8212;though not  debt repayment! The imperialists do not want a coup and they certainly do not  want a war between India and Pakistan. But the testing of a nuclear device by  India immediately provoked the Pakistan regime to follow suit. This shows the  limited ability of imperialism to control the situation. The ruling class in  both India and Pakistan are undoubtedly using the nuclear question as a  diversion, whipping up chauvinist sentiments in order to try to prevent the  development of revolution. But this can only be a temporary phenomenon. Once  the effects wear off, the attention of the masses will once more be focused on  their most pressing needs, for work, land, bread and shelter.</p>
  <p>
Pakistan capitalism remains extremely weak and unstable. All the  contradictions have been piling up for decades, producing an explosive  situation. Under the remorseless pressure of imperialism, Pakistan reduced its  tariffs. As a result, 3,462 medium and large companies closed. The country is,  effectively, bankrupt. In the last quarter of 1996 alone, $550 million went on  servicing the foreign debt. If it were not for the huge black economy (drugs,  gun-running etc.) the economy would collapse altogether. But in any case, the  present situation cannot be maintained for any length of time. There is  constant pressure from the IMF to raise indirect taxes on kerosene, gas,  electricity, and so cut the already miserable living standards of the masses.  But they are playing with fire. As in India, the Pakistan ruling clique tried  to divert the anger of the masses to the external enemy and whip up patriotic  sentiment over the issue of the nuclear test explosion. Probably Nawar Sharif  had no alternative but to follow the example of India. The military caste would  have accepted nothing less. But the consequences for Pakistan will be far more  serious than for India. The cutting-off of US aid will have far worse effects  on the finances of a state that is already teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.  New Delhi has $26 billion in foreign-exchange reserves, while Pakistan has only  $1.2 billion, barely enough for five weeks of imports. The merciless squeezing  of the masses is preparing an explosion in both countries. The 1968 revolution  was sparked off by a 10 per cent rise in the price of sugar. The same thing can  happen again.</p>
  <p>
There are many parallels between Pakistan and Russian tsarism. Like Russia,  Pakistan is a semi-feudal society upon which capitalism has been grafted in a  few areas, mainly Karachi and parts of the Punjab. The national question is  also similar, with the dominant Punjabis oppressing the Sindhis, Baluchis,  Pushtoons etc. If the working class does not take power, it is quite possible  that Pakistan could break up in the future. This possibility was already seen  with the bloody breakaway of Bangladesh (the former East Bengal.) Given the  mixing up of populations that has occurred (for example, Sindhis are in a  minority in Karachi, and Baluchis are in a minority in the cities of  Baluchistan), the break-up of Pakistan into its constituent parts would be an  absolute nightmare. Only the united revolutionary struggle of the Pakistani  working class can prevent this and solve the national question on the basis of  a democratic socialist federation, which could be the starting-point for the  Socialist Federation of the Indian Sub-continent. Only this can prevent the  horrors of wars and communal violence which will inevitably result from the  crisis of capitalism.</p>
  <p>
The PPP government of Benazir Bhutto was corrupt, but the present  government of Nawar Sharif is even worse. It is a government of the most rotten  sections of the compradore bourgeoisie, linked to the drug barons, which leans  on open fundamentalist reaction. The present unstable situation cannot last for  long. In the second half of 1997 500.000 jobs were destroyed as a result of the  imposition of IMF policies. This has temporarily had a stunning effect on the  working class with thousands of factories being closed. The population of  Pakistan is growing at a rate of 3.3 per cent per annum. The growth of the  economy cannot match this population growth. With the highest birth rate in the  world the country has among the lowest literacy rates and one of the worst  health care records in the world. The state spends on medicine about five pence  per person per year. The infrastructure of the country is collapsing. In the  last few years 7,500 kilometres of rail track have been closed. All state  assets are being prepared for privatisation. But even if they sold all these  assets (about &pound;5 billion worth) it would not even be enough to pay one year&rsquo;s  interest on the debt which amounts to &pound;7 billion. It is in the midst of this  social and economic crisis that the Pakistani ruling class is going ahead with  its nuclear arms programme. It reflects the deep impasse facing the ruling  class. In order to divert the attention of the masses away from the real  problems they are building up the outside enemy, India. This will not save the  Pakistani ruling class from the wrath of the masses once these begin to move.</p>
  <p>
All the signs indicate that the objective situation is beginning to change.  The mood of the masses is turning against the Nawar Sharif government. The PPP  called a demonstration in Karachi recently where Benazir Bhutto spoke. She was  expecting a turn-out of 5,000, but she found herself addressing a gathering of  500,000. Just the kind of support that she doesn&rsquo;t want. The leadership of the  PPP would prefer a situation where strikes are unsuccessful and demonstrations  only attract a small number of people, so that they can discourage the masses by  saying that the situation is difficult. To have half a million people on a  demonstration can only serve as a boost to the workers and students of  Pakistan. Apart from that demonstration there are many other indications that a  changing mood is taking place even in Karachi.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>Democracy or dictatorship?</strong> </h4>
  <p>
Another important characteristic of the current situation in the colonial  world is the shift of imperialism from supporting military rule to supporting &ldquo;democratic  rule&rdquo; wherever that has been possible. We saw that in Haiti, in the Philippines  and in a number of other countries, where Washington withdrew its support from  puppets on whom Washington based itself in the past. The two main reasons for  this change are on the one hand the fact that Stalinism is no longer a threat  and therefore, under the pressure of the masses, they are able to concede  formal democracy, as long as it does not threaten their economic and strategic  interests. On the other hand dictatorial rule tends to acquire a dynamic of its  own. Dictatorships create a massive and expensive bureaucratic apparatus, and  the dictators themselves have a tendency to cronyism and to luxury which eats  up part of the cake which the multinational companies are able to extract from  these countries. Some of them even dare to challenge their masters and cause  trouble for the Americans. This was the case with Noriega in Panama and with  Sadam Hussein in Iraq, to name just a couple.</p>
  <p>
As long as the pressure of the mass movement does not threaten the very  existence of the capitalist system, democracy is the most economical means of  government from the capitalist point of view. In any case, the most important  decisions will still be taken in Washington, Paris and London. The fact that,  for the time being, imperialism prefers &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; rule does not mean that it  is always able to achieve it. We should not forget that two of the countries  which were supposed to have smooth transitions to bourgeois democracy as part  of the New World Order scheme were Mobutu&rsquo;s Zaire and Nigeria. In both these  countries the military rulers had other ideas and cancelled the processes, much  to the chagrin of the imperialists. </p>
  <p>
This is also linked to the reluctance of US imperialism to get involved in  direct military intervention abroad. Our tendency has explained that the defeat  of the US in the Vietnam war was mainly due to mass opposition at home and the  restless mood amongst the troops. One US general actually compared the  situation amongst the soldiers in Vietnam to that of the Petrograd garrison in  1917. If the American Socialist Workers Party had had a genuine revolutionary  programme, the US would have been on the verge of a revolutionary situation  even at that time. That was the first time ever that the US had been defeated  in a war. At the time our tendency explained that would prevent them from  intervening with ground troops in a foreign country. The only exception that we  made was that of the Middle East, where we explained that the key importance of  oil for imperialism could force them to intervene in the case of a  revolutionary situation in Saudi Arabia.</p>
  <p>
Since then we have seen the US, the most powerful imperialist power in  history, withdraw its troops from Lebanon and Somalia. The only cases of actual  intervention with ground troops have been in tiny countries like Grenada,  Panama and Haiti where it was a question of a quick operation against small and  weak countries with very little risk.</p>
  <p>
By contrast, the Gulf war against Iraq was mainly based on aerial bombing.  Even when they smashed through the Iraqi lines and the road to Baghdad lay  open, they failed to march on Baghdad. They feared getting bogged down into a  protracted guerrilla war which would face mass opposition at home once the  soldiers started to be sent back in body-bags. Thus, we have the contradictory  situation of the most powerful imperialist power in history which at the same  time is impotent to intervene militarily with ground troops even in a small  weak country like Somalia. Nevertheless, this sudden &ldquo;love affair&rdquo; of imperialism  and democracy will only last for as long as formal democracy is able to  guarantee their economic domination. In any case, what sort of &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; is  this? At most, we can consider it as a semi-democracy, a fraud and a fig-leaf  to cover the domination of the banks, monopolies and imperialism. And as soon  as the working class and the peasantry present any serious challenge to  capitalist rule, they will resort again, without hesitation, to the same old  methods of ruthless dictatorships.</p>
  <p>
In Latin America, most of the dictatorial regimes fell and we now have &ldquo;normal&rdquo;  bourgeois democracy in almost the whole of the continent. But even here, as the  class conflicts became more acute, sections of the state apparatus are already  displaying their eagerness to go back to open repression against the labour  movement and its organisations. Already in Peru we have a regime of  parliamentary bonapartism in which increasingly the Army is being given a  bigger role in running the state, the justice system, etc. In many Latin  American countries the ruling class resorts to hired assassins to settle  matters with trade union activists. In Honduras, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina,  to name just a few formally democratic countries, trade union and peasant  activists have been killed in open daylight. From this to open dictatorships  there is still a step, but one which the ruling class in these countries, with  the full backing of US imperialism, will not hesitate to take when conditions  demand it.</p>
  <p>
However, they will only resort to this when the movement of the workers  fundamentally threatens the rule of capital. At the moment, in Latin America,  the pendulum has already started to shift to the left. We have seen massive  movements of the working class in the last period. Strikes, general strikes and  virtual regional insurrections have taken place in most of these countries. In  Ecuador the general strike, which had insurrectional features, overthrew the  hated Buccaram government, but because of the lack of a political alternative,  this was replaced by a more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; bourgeois government. Bolivia is the  clearest example of the limitations of militant trade unionism without a  political alternative and expression. In Bolivia we have seen the heroism of  the workers organising all-out general strikes almost on a yearly basis. But  without a revolutionary party, no way out is possible. Under conditions of  capitalist crisis, even the stormiest strikes cannot solve the fundamental  problems of the working class.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>Mexico</strong> </h4>
  <p>
On the surface it would seem that the Mexican economy has fully recovered  from the currency collapse of 1994/95, and some international analysts are even  saying that Mexico is the example the Asian economies should use to get out of  their recession as quickly as possible. Reality, however is very different.  After a horrific economic contraction in 1995 of 6.2 per cent, the economy grew  again in 1996 and even reached an impressive (official) 7 per cent growth in  1997. If these figures are averaged out over this three year period we get a mere  1.8 growth rate a year which is lower than the annual 1.9 per cent increase in  population. Real wages for workers, far from growing, have been falling,  according to a university study, by 34.5 per cent in the last three years. This  decline in wages is part of a more long term trend, for instance, the  purchasing power of the legal minimum wage is now only 25 per cent of what it  was in 1980.</p>
  <p>
One of the main reasons for this economic growth is precisely the increased  competitiveness of Mexican exports as a result of the devaluation of the peso.  This has mainly benefited the &ldquo;maquiladora&rdquo; sector, of assembly factories for  US companies concentrated in the US-Mexican border with appalling working  practices. This sector is facing increased competition from South East Asian  exports, now much cheaper after the collapse of their currencies.  (Incidentally, the maquiladora workers are starting to organise in a similar  process to the one in SE Asian low wage economies). This is putting pressure on  the Mexican currency, and another collapse of the peso is not ruled out,  especially when one takes into account that bad debts represent 42 per cent of  the total. The Mexican government is trying to prevent this with a policy of  controlled devaluation.</p>
  <p>
The fall in the price of oil has also badly hurt the Mexican economy  because, although oil exports represent only 9 per cent of GNP, they account  for 40 per cent of state revenue. So far this year the government has  introduced two packages of budgetary cuts directly as a result of the fall in  oil prices. Taking all these factors into account, and in the context of a  bleak perspective for the world economy, the official forecast for economic  growth in 1998 of 5.2 per cent is quite clearly exaggerated (and in fact the  government has already revised this figure down twice).</p>
  <p>
Given the weak economic situation it comes as no surprise that the process  of decomposition of the regime (which started at the end of the 80s and  accelerated after the zapatista uprising in 1994) has continued. Increasingly,  sections of the PRI bureaucrats are leaving the party, like rats deserting the  sinking ship, forming their own parties, or joining the left wing PRD or the  right wing PAN. In 1997 even an important section of the official union  bureaucracy split off from the official trade union federation (the CTM) and  formed their own National Workers Union (UNT), which maintains their old  anti-democratic internal practices but nevertheless opposes the government&rsquo;s  economic policy, which is undermining their wealth and privileges as trade  union leaders.</p>
  <p>
The developing crisis is shown by the splits in the ruling elite. There are  sections of the state apparatus and the bosses who favour a &ldquo;tough&rdquo; policy  against all opposition movements. Their main concern is the zapatista movement  and they have taken a number of measures in order to force them to surrender or  eliminate them. They passed an indigenous rights law in Parliament which is  opposed by the PRD and breaks all previous agreements between the government and  the EZLN. They have launched a campaign to expel foreigners working in  different NGOs from Chiapas (200 of them so far have been expelled) in order to  get rid of unwanted witnesses. Finally they have stepped up the army presence  in Chiapas, setting up army check-points, with army helicopters and planes  flying at low height over the zapatista communities, etc. The government is  also financing, arming and training paramilitary organisations, not only in  Chiapas but in other conflict-ridden areas of the country. A number of the  zapatista-created &ldquo;autonomous municipalities&rdquo; in Chiapas have already been  disbanded by the army and recently the army carried out a massacre in Guerrero,  allegedly trying to disband a unit of the People&rsquo;s Revolutionary army (EPR).</p>
  <p>
The repression is not, of course, aimed only at the zapatistas. Trade union  activists, debtors organisations, peasant leaders, etc. all have been harassed  with illegal arrests (like in the case of trade union leader Aquiles Maga&ntilde;a),  assassination attempts (like in the case of debtors organisation leader and  Marxist Federico Valdez in Chiapas) and actual murders (more than 600 PRD  members have been murdered in the last 10 years). This increase in repression,  nevertheless, is not a sign of strength on the part of the PRI regime, but of  weakness. Increasingly, people are losing their fear of repression. Although  strike levels are low, mainly due to high unemployment and job insecurity, the  process of formation of democratic currents within the official unions is accelerating.  Workers and peasants are joining the PRD as the only channel where they can  express their aspirations for change, despite the corrupt and careerist nature  of many of its leaders. The working class is the main factor in the situation  in Mexico (and most of the other countries in Latin America) and has proved  this time and again. The participation of the workers in the political scene,  especially in the million strong May Day demonstrations in 1994 and 1995 marked  an important milestone in the decomposition of the PRI regime.</p>
  <p>
The rise of the PRD is illustrated by their election victory in the Federal  District (DF) last summer, which everyone though it was going to be won by the  PAN, and also by the fact that the PRI lost the overall majority in Congress  for the first time. Now the PRI bureaucracy and national government are trying  to undermine and sabotage Cardenas as mayor of Mexico City in order to weaken  him in the run-up to the presidential elections in 2000. Nevertheless the  masses still have considerable illusions in the PRD (especially in Cardenas  who, together with Manuel L&oacute;pez Obrador, represents its &ldquo;left&rdquo; wing). Inside  the PRD the divisions between the left and the right (represented by Mu&ntilde;oz  Ledo) are on the increase. The recent PRD Congress declared that the party was  a &ldquo;left wing party&rdquo;, a move which obviously reflects the pressure from below.  The DF organisation of the party is controlled by the so-called Democratic Left  Current.</p>
  <p>
It is possible that the PRD will win the elections in the year 2000. But if  the PRD comes to power and does not carry out a revolutionary programme, it  will inevitably prepare the way for reaction and a worse situation than before.  In the context of a world slump and a collapse of the Mexican economy, they  would come under the enormous pressure of contradictory forces. On the one hand  imperialism would try to use the PRD&rsquo;s authority amongst the masses to carry  through a policy of even more cuts and privatisations. On the other hand the  workers and peasants would expect a PRD government to solve their most urgent  problems: wages, trade union democracy, corruption, the land, etc. The initial  euphoria would rapidly dissipate under conditions of capitalist crisis and the  masses would go on the offensive, not even waiting for the government to act.  The pressure of the mass movement will be reflected in the PRD with the  emergence of a more clearly defined left wing increasingly faced to those  leaders more openly linked to the bourgeoisie.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>Nigeria after Abacha</strong> </h4>
  <p>
After South Africa, the key country in Africa is Nigeria. It is the biggest  country in Black Africa with a population of over 100 million. One in five  Africans live in Nigeria. Since its formal independence in the early 1960s,  Nigeria has experienced continual political crisis, civil war, and lengthy  periods of military rule. The civilian government of Shagari, which presided  over widespread corruption, the doubling of foreign debt and the destruction of  the country&rsquo;s manufacturing base, prepared the way for the military coup of  General Babangida in 1985, who in turn was replaced by Abacha. Under the  military the country slipped further into economic crisis. Today Nigeria has  debts of &pound;19 billion. Despite its exceptionally valuable resources&#8212;Nigeria is  the world&rsquo;s fifth-largest oil producer&#8212;the country suffers from an acute  energy crisis. The breakdown in infrastructure has led to a position where only  one of its refineries is working and its power stations are operating at only  32 per cent of their normal capacity. The impasse of Nigerian society is  revealed by the fact that 64 per cent lack access to clean water and  sanitation, half of the population is illiterate, and life expectancy is only  51 years.</p>
  <p>
As with the rest of the ex-colonial world, aid was linked to arms deals.  Between 1988 and 1992 arms poured in to Nigeria: Italy provided $143 million  worth, Czechoslovakia $134 million, France $74 million and Britain $75 million.  Even after the annulment of the 1993 elections, and the hanging of Ken  Sara-Wiwa, finance and arms came in from abroad.</p>
  <p>
In August 1994 the military government disbanded the national executives of  the Nigerian Labour Congress, and the oil and gas workers&rsquo; unions. The regime  has clamped down hard on opponents, attacking trade unionists, closing universities  and arresting oppositionists. But the Nigerian working class is one of the most  powerful in Africa and has a militant tradition. The death of Abacha opens up  an entirely new and stormy situation in Nigeria. On the 12th March 1998, we  wrote to the Nigerian Marxists: &ldquo;The bourgeoisie will move to abandon the  military government when they feel the ground trembling beneath their feet.  They may go towards a popular front&#8212;where the representatives of the working  class are brought into the government to do the dirty work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
Far sooner than we anticipated, this perspective has been confirmed by  events. The sudden death of Abacha is unlikely to have been the result of  natural causes. More likely the imperialists, who have big interests in Nigeria  were terrified of an explosion, which was clearly being prepared, and decided  to get rid of him, since all their pressure had no effect. But in the same way  that the resignation of Suharto marks the beginning of the revolution in  Indonesia, so the death of Abacha is the first episode in the revolution in the  most important country in Black Africa. The masses spontaneously came out onto  the streets to express their joy at the removal of the hated oppressor. But now  the bourgeoisie and the imperialists will move quickly to try to head off the  movement of the masses, by shifting from the right boot to the left.</p>
  <p>
Whatever bourgeois regime is established we do not give it any shred of  support politically. However, we must use the limited democratic rights that  may be granted to step up our propaganda for the overthrow of the bourgeois  regime and the coming to power of the working class. Again, we will stress the  working class has to rely on its own power, its own strength, its own  organisation and its own independent strategy and tactics. In no way can the  Marxists support the so-called &ldquo;democrat&rdquo; Abiola. An independent position must  be maintained. Even when Lenin stood for bourgeois democracy in Russia, he  always opposed the liberal bourgeoisie under tsarism and in other countries. He  constantly hammered away at the main theme: no faith in the bourgeois liberals!  Trust only in your own forces to find a solution to the problems of the working  class! It was the Stalinists who poisoned the movement with their class  collaborationist ideas and their support for the liberals. The same thing is  true for Nigeria. Were he alive today, Lenin would say to the Nigerian masses:  rely on your own forces, strength, organisation. Have no illusions whatsoever  in the liberal bourgeoisie. Of course, after a long period of military  dictatorship there will be illusions in bourgeois democracy. We must take this  into account and fight for all serious democratic demands, especially the  demand for a Constituent Assembly. But we must link democratic demands to the  socialist demands in a transitional way.</p>
  <p>
We do not call for support for one bourgeois government as opposed to  another. However, the overthrow of the Junta, even if it leads to a new  bourgeois government, would be a step forward. New conditions would be created  that would permit the proletariat to organise more freely and give us new  platforms for our ideas. Every single democratic right that is gained by the  working class is a step forward to be used to further the cause of the  socialist revolution. At the same time, we have no trust in any new &ldquo;democratic&rdquo;  bourgeois government. That was the position of Lenin and Trotsky in 1917, as  opposed to the conciliationism of Stalin and Kamenev who wanted to support the  Provisional Government &ldquo;in so far&rdquo; as it supported the revolution.</p>
  <p>
The whole history of Nigeria, which has swung between &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; and  dictatorship, is indicative of the instability of society. Only the force of  mass action and revolution can force the Junta out, and lay the basis for the conquest  of all the democratic demands. That was the reason NOT to vote for Abiola in  the elections of June 1993. We must not reinforce any illusions in him. It was  entirely false to urge the workers to vote for Abiola as the &ldquo;lesser evil&rdquo;. The  two parties are both in reality government parties. The military allowed the  election on the basis of two official government-approved parties alone. That  was a farce and we could not support it. Either way the ruling clique would  win! In the United States we would not support any of the bourgeois candidates  for the presidential election. That would be a betrayal of our class position.  We campaign for the US Labour Party to put up a candidate against the  bourgeoisie. When in Nigeria the Junta annulled the election, the only way  forward was mass action by the trade unions and the working class. We are  obviously in favour of the overthrow of the Junta, but have no illusions in the  type of bourgeois democrats that are now being pushed forward.</p>
  <p>
The Nigerian bourgeoisie is afraid of bourgeois democracy because it fears  the masses. Only when there was the threat of revolution did imperialism  intervene to support the bourgeois democrats, as in Latin America. Even Abiola  had, in effect, supported the Junta, allowing himself to be selected as a &ldquo;reliable&rdquo;  man for the election. For that very reason he is now being pushed forward again  as a supposed &ldquo;democratic alternative&rdquo;. He poses no threat to the ruling elite  or imperialism. The leadership of the Nigerian Labour Congress, now staffed  with government stooges, is not prepared to fight, as it would mean conducting  a revolutionary struggle. We must base ourselves on the working class,  particularly its more militant sections like the oil workers. The Nigerian  Marxists correctly call for committees of action to co-ordinate mass action and  advance transitional demands such as the confiscation of the property of the  imperialists, nationalisation, Constituent Assembly&#8212;this is the only really  revolutionary policy: one that links the democratic demands with an  anti-capitalist programme.</p>
  <p>
For the mass, a solution to their problems would be in &ldquo;elections&rdquo; or an &ldquo;assembly&rdquo;  of some kind. A military police dictatorship always reinforces illusions in  bourgeois democracy amongst the mass. All eyes are centred on the fall of the  dictatorship and the return to &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;. The masses see &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; as a  means to solve their problems. For the &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; bourgeois it is a means of  heading off the revolutionary potential in the masses. The Marxists have to  take this situation into account. Trotsky makes the same point in relation to  the Chinese revolution and the need for the Trotskyists to take into  consideration the desire for democratic rights after being under the heel of  Bonapartist dictatorship. This is a natural feeling after the experience of the  military junta. &ldquo;We want our basic democratic rights&rdquo; will be a widespread  feeling. We must use this feeling to our advantage. Our task is to link the  desire for democratic rights&#8212;the right to organise trade unions and political  parties, the right to strike, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly,  etc.&#8212;to the question of and a programme for, the socialist revolution. We must  give a class content to this expression for democratic rights. We must expose  the bourgeoisie&rsquo;s claim to be the champions of &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;. This approach will  give us the ear of the masses and an opportunity to explain the Marxist case.</p>
  <p>
The position of &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; first, then socialism later is a variety of  Stalinism. Of course, the Constituent Assembly remains a rallying point for the  working class, but is no solution in and of itself. Only by a workers&rsquo;  government taking over the economy can the problems begin to be solved. Of  course only by spreading the revolution to the rest of Africa and the West can  there be a real solution.</p>
  <p>
In view of the radicalisation of the masses and the fear of an uprising,  the bourgeois reformists and left reformists are clearly afraid of this development  and wish to avoid it. We cannot support a class collaborationist policy.  Instead of adapting to the pressure of the petty bourgeois, the Marxists need  to put forward clear class ideas. Of course, under conditions of semi-legality  or illegality, it is difficult to maintain a clear class position. The truth of  this assertion is shown by the experience of the Bolsheviks in 1917 when  Stalin, Kamenev and Zinoviev wavered and succumbed to the pressure of the  bourgeois and petty bourgeois public opinion and took the line of least  resistance. But it is necessary to fight against the stream. Without a clear  and independent class position, no way out is possible.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>South Africa</strong> </h4>
  <p>
South Africa remains the key country in the whole of Africa. For decades,  the magnificent black proletariat has given ample proof of its bravery and its  marvellous revolutionary instinct. Only the lack of the subjective factor stood  in the way of a classical proletarian revolution in South Africa. Although  events have evolved differently to what we had originally envisaged, the  fundamental perspectives remain the same. On a capitalist basis there is no  future for South Africa, any more than any other country. The main reason was  that the ANC leadership, especially Mandela, after the fall of Stalinism, where  quite prepared to make a deal with the white ruling class so that they would  become part of it. In exchange they assured them that nothing fundamental would  change. The ANC leaders committed themselves to capitalist policies, to the acceptance  of the continued rule of the white big business community, no actions to be  taken against those responsible for past crimes against the people, and so on.  In other words, they agreed to a complete sell-out.</p>
  <p>
US imperialism had for some time recognised that the situation could not be  maintained as before. The pressure and militancy of the black working class had  become too strong as to be put down simply by repression. As always, reforms  are a by-product of revolution. Terrified of the danger of a revolution in  South Africa, Washington put heavy pressure on De Klerk and the other  representatives of the white ruling class to force them to accept some kind of &ldquo;majority  rule&rdquo;, with a number of conditions. For once, overruling his petty bourgeois  Afrikaner followers, De Klerk reached a deal with the ANC&#8212;something that we  had not expected. In the past, whenever it looked as if a deal would be done  against their interests, they always split away and succeeded in turning the  situation back again. The National Party was itself the result of such a split  before the War. It seemed most likely that something of the sort would occur  again. But the specific weight of the Afrikaners (mainly farmers) had declined  over the past few decades, to the point where they could not exercise the kind  of decisive influence as in the past. In the moment of truth, the Afrikaners  were reduced to impotent gestures and terrorism. It was big business and  imperialism that decided.</p>
  <p>
Incidentally, it was by no means a foregone conclusion that the deal would  be struck. All the elements that we based our perspectives on were present in  the process. There were many instances in which the process seemed to be  breaking down. One of them was after the assassination of Chris Hani when the  black youth rioted and demanded action on the part of the ANC leaders. The only  reply they got was &ldquo;maintain calm&rdquo;. The white Afrikaners also resorted to  violence and the actions of the ABW and the extreme right wing elements within  the state apparatus were directed to try and destabilise the situation. They  also resorted to a campaign of terror, making use of the services of the  reactionary &ldquo;Zulu&rdquo; Inkatha movement which nearly prevented the elections from  taking place in some regions. But in the end the elements working in favour of  the agreement were stronger than what we had thought and the elections went  ahead.</p>
  <p>
The fact that things have turned out differently to what we expected does  not at all invalidate our general perspectives for South Africa. Even now there  is no majority rule in South Africa, in any meaningful sense. The agreement  arrived at between de Klerk and the ANC was for a National Government to be  formed with representatives from all parties. It will not be until after the  1999 general elections that a normal procedure for the formation of governments  will be in place.</p>
  <p>
We should not underestimate the effect of the conceding of some democratic  rights amongst the black population. Inevitably, at the beginning, there were  some illusions. The concession of some things like electricity and clean water  in the townships, in particular, will be seen by the blacks as a major advance.  But the hopes placed in the ANC leaders by the masses far exceed such  concessions. The black workers and especially the youth have grown increasingly  angry at the conduct of the ANC leaders. After generations of what amounted to  slavery, the mass of black South Africans aspire to real equality and civilised  conditions of existence. For the masses the question of democracy is always a  concrete question, linked to jobs, wages and housing. The ANC-led government  introduced through the misnamed Growth, Employment and Redistribution plan  (GEAR) a number of attacks on trade union rights, privatisation of the  utilities, etc. This forced the COSATU leaders (which described GEAR as a &ldquo;programme  of finance capital&rdquo;) to call a number of important strikes and movements. They  did so mainly to let-off steam and maintain their prestige within the movement,  but the clashes between an ANC coalition government and COSATU reflect a deeper  trend.</p>
  <p>
As we said in 1992: &ldquo;the &lsquo;reform&rsquo; will not prevent social upheaval,  especially in the event of a downturn in the world economy, which would be a  catastrophe for the black population. It would also threaten the jobs and  privilege of the whites, who would begin to desert de Klerk and move towards  reaction. In the same way, as the mass of blacks realise that they have been  deceived, the ANC&rsquo;s base will begin to decline. Crises and splits will open up  within the ANC itself. Despite everything, it is not certain that agreement  will be reached. But even if a deal is signed, that would solve none of the  fundamental contradictions in South African society. It would usher in a new  period of social upheavals and turbulence.&rdquo; (World Perspectives, August 1992)</p>
  <p>
We can see that already happening. There is a growing discontent within the  ANC rank and file and the unions about this government and the way a new black  elite has joined the white bourgeoisie leaving the majority of the black  population still living in conditions of poverty.</p>
  <p>
The extent to which the ANC leaders have retreated could be seen in the  50th ANC Conference. In a report for the Australian magazine GreenLeft Weekly,  Oupa Lehulere writes that: &ldquo;Nelson Mandela singled out only Chief Mangosuthu  Gatsha Buthelezi&rsquo;s Inkatha Freedom Party for praise and personally introduced  the IFP representative to loud applause. &hellip; The ANC public is being prepared for  a possible merger of the two organisations, and the accession of Mangosuthu  Buthelezi to the position of the deputy presidency of South Africa. The new ANC  deputy president, Jacob Zuma from KwaZulu-Natal, is believed to favour such a  merger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
We already warned in 1992 that &ldquo;as the mass of blacks realise that they  have been deceived, the ANC&rsquo;s base will begin to decline.&rdquo; (WP, 1992). The same  report comments: &ldquo;Organisational weaknesses, falling membership and  non-functioning branches also conspired to help smooth the victory of the ANC  right at Mafikeng. The Eastern Cape delegation, once the strongest ANC region,  was only half its 1994 strength due to falling membership.&rdquo; (GreenLeft Weekly)</p>
  <p>
At the end of the day, the masses will judge the success of &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; by  its ability to provide houses, jobs and decent living conditions. The ANC  leaders promised all these things. But now it is becoming clear that the  improvement in living standards is being confined to a small minority of middle  class blacks. The great majority have gained little. Some blacks have succeeded  in entering the boards of directors of the big monopolies where the white elite  has made room for them. This incudes a number of prominent ANC leaders, who  have joined the ruling class. Thus, the whole swindle of &ldquo;reform&rdquo; is reduced to  the enrichment of a tiny handful of privileged blacks and the preservation of  the rule of the same old white oligarchy under the protection of the ANC. Thabo  Mbeki is the consummate representative of this layer of black bourgeois.</p>
  <p>
A statistical report recently published described South Africa as having  the second widest gap between poor and rich, after only Brazil. The poorest 40  percent of the South African population earns a mere 11 percent of the country&rsquo;s  income, and the richest 7 percent an astronomical 40 percent. But while in the  past this gap was associated with the racial divide this is not so much the  case now, as an enormous gap has opened amongst black South Africans. Those at  the top now live in the same conditions and neighbourhoods, go to the same  clubs, etc. as the white businessmen while those at the bottom have seen their  living standards plunge. There are actually more blacks than whites in the  country&rsquo;s top income group.</p>
  <p>
The report graphically explains how &ldquo;the share of national income earned by  black South Africa&rsquo;s poorest 40 percent has shrunk by 48 percent, whereas the  share of the richest 10 percent has grown by 43 percent&rdquo;. This is the reason  behind the much publicised rise in criminality and lawlessness, not the &ldquo;legacy  of the methods used in the struggle against apartheid&rdquo; as the bourgeois press  likes to claim. The wealthy live in fortified houses, in fear of the wrath of  the poor. The situation is turning into a nightmare for all sections of  society&#8212;blacks, coloureds and whites alike. And on the basis of the crisis of  capitalism, things can only get worse. The ANC leaders want to attract foreign  investors, but at the same time must try to keep the masses quiet by at least  the semblance of reforms. This policy will in the end satisfy nobody.</p>
  <p>
The black workers did not struggle for decades for this. The discontent and  anger of the workers will result in a new wave of struggle like those of the  past, but on a higher level. Having got rid of Apartheid (at least in its  formal sense), and thrust the ANC leaders into power, the workers will come to  understand the need for class politics. The way will be open for the formation  of a genuine Marxist tendency. Particularly important in this respect is the  SACP. There is the possibility of the South African Communist Party splitting  off from the ANC and making an alliance with the powerful union confederation  COSATU. This is without doubt an expression of the enormous pressure of the  rank and file members.</p>
  <p>
Cape Town&rsquo;s daily &ldquo;Die Burger&rdquo; draws the same conclusion as Marxists: &ldquo;The  government&rsquo;s policy has effectively enriched the rich, especially rich blacks,  and largely left the poor of all races to their fate. Thus a time bomb is being  created that may yet see Marx&rsquo;s revolutionary dreams being realised in South  Africa.&rdquo; (Die Burger (Internet Version) in English 16 June 98).</p>
  <p>
South Africa&rsquo;s GDP grew only by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 1998  and the coming world slump is likely to have serious consequences on the  country&rsquo;s economy. The growing frustration of the black working class will find  an expression through its organisations provoking splits and turmoil within the  ANC, the SACP and COSATU. With the revolutionary traditions of the black  proletariat and youth we can expect big class battles in the coming period in  South Africa. </p>
  <h4>
<strong>The Middle East</strong> </h4>
  <p>
There is not a single stable regime in the Middle East. Even Saudi Arabia  is in crisis, as the falling price of oil undermines its revenues. There are no  longer the same possibilities for buying the allegiance of the population with lavish  subsidies. The splits and crises at the top are an indication of the impasse of  the regime. The crisis in Bahrain has already led to disturbances and a &ldquo;pro-democracy&rdquo;  movement. This in turn has split the Saudi ruling elite. One section (king  Fahd) is said to favour concessions, while officially the Saudi government,  headed by the weak acting prime minister Prince Abdullah, is opposed to  concessions. The ferment of unrest was shown by the car-bomb that killed five  Americans and two Indians in a US-managed office in Saudi Arabia. A revolution  in Saudi Arabia is not at all ruled out in the next period. That is why Saudi  Arabia was anxious to avoid a new US attack on Iraq, which could have provoked  mass opposition at home, and even led to the downfall of the regime. Such a  turn in the situation would have the most serious consequences as a result of  the key economic and strategic importance of Saudi Arabia for US imperialism.  The USA would be forced to intervene, which would provoke a revolutionary explosion  throughout the Middle East and beyond.</p>
  <p>
In the Middle East the policy of the two stages has had its most pernicious  results, leading to the defeat of the revolution in one country after another,  and the rise of fundamentalist reaction. The bourgeois and imperialists, who at  first backed the fundamentalists as a counterweight to the danger of  revolution, are now terrified of the consequences of their own actions. In  Algeria, the masses showed tremendous courage and determination in the war of  liberation against French imperialism. That could have led to the socialist  revolution in both Algeria and France, had it not been for the policies of the  French Stalinists and the national limitedness of the leaders of the FLN. The  latter did not see the need to make a class appeal to the French working class,  but adopted a purely nationalist policy. Consequently the one and a half  million French settlers, many of them skilled people whose services would have  been useful to the Algerian people, fled the country, causing great  difficulties to the economy. The petty bourgeois nationalist leaders of the FLN  called themselves socialists and carried through measures of nationalisation,  but did not finish the job of expropriating capital and breaking with  imperialism. (The Chinese Stalinists, in the person of Chou En Lai actively  discouraged them from doing this.) As a result, they prepared the way for  reaction, first with the coup of Boumidienne, and later, with catastrophic  results, the rise of fundamentalism. </p>
  <p>
After almost four decades of independence on a bourgeois basis, Algeria is  in mess despite huge potential oil wealth. Millions of young people are  unemployed and have no future. The crisis of capitalism means that the safety  valve of emigration to France is virtually closed. The brilliant success in the  war of liberation has turned to ashes in their mouths. In desperation, they  turn to fundamentalism. This is a terrible irony, since the traditions of the  Algerian revolution were secular and progressive. Islamic reaction&#8212;in common  with Jewish, Catholic, Protestant and Hindu fundamentalism&#8212;combines in equal  proportion religious fanaticism and black reaction. The anti-imperialist  demagogy they use does not change this fact. The real face of fundamentalism is  shown by the barbaric massacre of men, women and children, although many of  these massacres are clearly the work of the state forces. There is nothing to  choose between them. The bloody impasse in Algeria is the result of the failure  of the FLN to carry through the revolution to the end. It sharply reminds us of  Marx&rsquo;s famous statement of the choice facing humanity&#8212;socialism or barbarism.  The same kind of barbarism we see in Algeria will face other nations, and not  only in the Third World, if the working class does not take power.</p>
  <p>
At the heart of the crisis in the Middle East is the Israel-Palestinian  conflict. This has already led to four wars, and is still unresolved. The  so-called peace deal brokered by US imperialism has solved nothing. Washington  would like a peaceful settlement because it does not want conflicts that could  place in jeopardy its huge investments in the area, and despite its close links  with the ruling elite in Saudi Arabia, it will always in the end come down in  favour of Israel, because it remains the only firm ally it possesses in that  part of the world. Despite its annoyance at the provocative policy pursued by  Tel Aviv, it has no alternative but to accept.</p>
  <p>
Our tendency consistently opposed the insane policies of terrorism and  guerrillaism (it was really the same thing) pursued by the PLO leadership in  the past. This led to one disaster after another and did nothing to bring about  the solution of the problems of the Palestinian people. On the contrary, it  played into the hands of the Israeli ruling class and alienated the Jewish  masses. We must remind ourselves that we were the only ones to point out that  the only way to defeat Israeli imperialism was through the development of mass  struggle in the occupied territories, especially the West Bank.</p>
  <p>
This perspective was shown to be correct by the magnificent  Intifada&#8212;something the PLO leaders had not expected and did nothing to  prepare. The Intifada was a partial success. It could not be more than partial  in the absence of a conscious leadership capable of making a class appeal to  the Jewish workers and soldiers. That is the key to success. It is necessary to  build a fighting alliance between the Palestinian masses and the working class  in Israel. The latter is subject to the attacks of the Israeli ruling class,  and are fighting back. The early pioneers of Israel were really utopian  socialists who stood for the nationalisation of the economy. The trade union,  the Histadruth actually owns a large slice of the economy. But, in common with  all other capitalist countries, the Israeli ruling class is carrying out a  vicious policy of cuts and privatisation. This has led to an explosion of the  class struggle in Israel.</p>
  <p>
At the beginning of December 1997, Israel was rocked by a general strike  called by the General Federation of labour, Histadruth. The strike started on  December 3rd, lasted for five days and ended in victory. 700,000 workers  participated in the open ended strike despite the media attacks and the threats  of the Netanyahu government to use the law against the strikers, fine the union  and jail their leaders, and the courts declaring the strike &ldquo;non-legal&rdquo;. One  year before Sholo Shani, Histadruth&rsquo;s number two, was arrested for &ldquo;contempt of  court&rdquo; over a wave of strikes and also that the first attempt of Histadruth&rsquo;s  to call a general strike last September was halted after a few hours by the  courts. The general strike was not just an isolated issue but part of the  general concern over the growing economic crisis hitting Israel. There have  been a number of bitter strikes, like the occupation of the Kitan textile  factory in Nazareth Elite by its workforce protesting against closure, the  struggle of the Tel Aviv refuse collectors against privatisation, the struggle  at Haifa Chemicals, etc. In some of them, like the protests at the &ldquo;development  town&rdquo; of Ofakim against unemployment, Jewish and Arab workers have demonstrated  together. It was actually the Histadruth members at different works councils  the ones who forced their leaders to call the general strike.</p>
  <p>
This new divide in Israeli society over class issues has also had an effect  in its politics. There has been talk of the need to create a party based on the  unions and the works councils, and even the Labour Party MP and general  secretary of Histadruth Amir Peretz, has made sympathetic comments about the  idea. The Labour Party, traditionally based in the more middle class Ashkenazi  Jews (of European origin), and during the general strike showed no support at  all for it, and actually some of their leaders said if they were in power they  would apply the same politics as Netanyahu. The divisions are also affecting  Likud, traditionally based in the poorer, working class Sephardic Jews (of  Middle Eastern origin) which has been seen as abandoning its traditional supporters  by applying an openly &ldquo;thatcherite revolution&rdquo; programme. This is the reason  behind the resignation of one of Netanyahu&rsquo;s coalition government ministers,  David Levy, because of his opposition to the cuts in social spending. He was  obviously worried about the loss of support for his small party among Jewish  workers. These developments show that a class based programme, would be able to  unite Jew and Arab workers, Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews cutting across  national and religious hatred. But the tactics of groups like Hamas have  precisely the opposite effect, pushing the Israeli masses behind the Likud, and  giving help and encouragement to the most reactionary elements in Israeli  society, while sacrificing some of the most courageous elements of the Palestinian  youth who have given their lives to no purpose.</p>
  <p>
The madness of fundamentalism was never part of the Palestinian tradition.  As in Algeria, it is the price that is paid for the refusal of the leadership  to pursue a socialist policy. Only a programme based on class and  internationalist policies can succeed in uniting the Arab and Israeli masses  against the common enemy. The socialist revolution in Israel can be the  starting point of the revolution throughout the Middle East. In order to  succeed, it cannot be limited to Israel and the occupied territories, but must  be fought for in the whole of the Middle East as a first step if it is to  succeed at all.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>The SE Asian &ldquo;miracle&rdquo;</strong> </h4>
  <p>
The one place in the former colonial world where there had been a  significant growth of the economy until very recently was in South East Asia,  where the so-called &ldquo;tiger economies&rdquo; were held up as models of how capitalism  could provide a formula for overcoming backwardness. In fact, there are  specific historical reasons why Japan, South Korea and even Taiwan developed in  this way. It was mainly as a result of the peculiar correlation of forces which  developed after the Second World War. Trotsky made the point that reforms and  all kinds of important changes are the by-product of revolution. This law is  applicable, not just in a particular country, but internationally. The agrarian  reform which was the fundamental task of the bourgeois democratic revolution in  Japan and South Korea was introduced as a result of the fear of US imperialism  of an extension of the Chinese revolution (in the case of Japan it was  introduced directly by the US occupation forces after the Second World War).  They carried through a profound reform from the top to prevent a revolution  from below. Does that contradict the theory of the permanent revolution? No, it  does not. These countries are precisely exceptions, not the rule. And if South  Korea, Japan and Taiwan are exceptions, Hong Kong and Singapore are even more  peculiar exceptions. They are not countries at all, but city-states which have  benefited from certain developments in the world economy.</p>
  <p>
It is also worth noting that these economies did not develop on the basis  of free market and opening up of the markets, but on the contrary on the basis  of state intervention in the economy and high tariff barriers to protect their  national industries. In South Korea there were 5 year plans and banks were told  which companies to lend money to, and the companies were told where to invest  and what products to develop.</p>
  <p>
Only a year ago, Asia was held up as a brilliant example of the successes  of capitalism and the market. The bourgeoisie was drunk with the illusion that  Asia could guarantee a dazzling future of continuous growth and prosperity.  These illusions even found an echo inside the ranks of the Marxists. The  question was asked as to whether the development of Asia, together with new  fields of investment like information technology and globalisation, did not  signify a new period of capitalist upswing, like the one that followed 1945. We  pointed out that there was nothing new about these developments. One can find  analogous processes in every period in the development of capitalism, from the 16th  century onwards. The rate of profits which the foreign investors originally got  were huge&#8212;in the order of 20, 30 or even 50 per cent. That is a magnet for  investment and growth. But Marx explained that this is only possible in the  first stages. In the longer term the rate of profits tends to fall to the  average rate.</p>
  <p>
That is exactly what happened in South East Asia. The development of the  working class means the development of a strike movement, the fight against  exploitation, which at a certain stage will lead to higher wages and the  cancellation of the initial advantages. In the meantime the contradictions have  become sharper. In other words you have the objective conditions for socialist  revolution. The classical laws of capitalism apply in this case as in all  others. Two or three years ago the bourgeois were euphoric about SE Asia and  China. But now they are facing massive over capacity, or, in other words,  over-production. What has happened in the countries of SE Asia&#8212;and that was  easily predictable from a Marxist point of view&#8212;is that now they are entering  a normal capitalist situation. They face massive over-capacity in all sectors  of production: cars, semiconductors, consumer electronics, micro-chips and  chemical processing. This is a classical capitalist model as described by Marx.</p>
  <p>
We welcomed the investment and the industrialisation of SE Asia. From a  Marxist point of view it is a good thing, because it creates a strong working  class and thereby creates the objective conditions for socialist revolution. As  with tsarist Russia one hundred years ago, these foreign investments do not  remove the social antagonisms but only exacerbate them. These processes are  very similar to what happened in Russia at the turn of the century. In the  1890s there was a colossal development of the productive forces, although  limited to certain regions. This was exclusively based in foreign capital in  the area around Moscow, St. Petersburg, the Urals and the West of Russia. But  Russia remained an extremely backward country. There were only 3 million  workers out of a total population of 150 million. That is much more backward  than the India of today. The kind of industries that were established in Russia  then, because of the law of uneven and unequal development, were the most  modern industries in the world, with very high rates of growth and high  concentration of the labour force. And on the basis of very low wages, they got  very high rates of profits. Exactly the same position we have seen in the &ldquo;tiger  economies&rdquo; up until recently. The period of explosive economic growth in  tsarist Russia ended in the revolutions of 1905 and 1917. </p>
  <p>
The bourgeoisie always looks for higher rates of profit and when it finds  them they pile in it, and they invest like mad. The first ones to get there get  massive profits, but because of the anarchy of capitalist production they  eventually cause massive overproduction. That is the root cause of the crisis  which in SE Asia (which was supposed to have escaped from the normal laws of  capitalism and established a uniquely Asian model based on perpetual  growth&#8212;like the old dream of a &ldquo;perpetual motion&rdquo; machine) now appears in its  classical form. The problem is that the bourgeoisie only saw these countries as  a market and field of investment. They did not realise that once the latter had  build up their industry they would start to export. China has now overtaken  Japan as the country with the biggest trade surplus with the USA, as a  consequence of which, sections of the American Congress have developed a sudden  pious concern for &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; in China. Every period of capitalist  development has been accompanied by the opening up of new areas of the globe,  from the discovery of the New World at the dawn of capitalism, through the  development of colonialism in the 18th and 19th centuries, China, California  and Australia in the last century, and so on.</p>
  <p>
Already in the pages of the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels already  explained that the capitalist system, unlike all preceding modes of production,  constantly develops the means of production by seeking new areas of investment.  This was precisely the progressive side of capitalism. What is striking about  the present epoch is not the existence of new areas of productive  investment&#8212;without which the system could not exist&#8212;but the paucity of  productive investment and the enormous amount of capital devoted to  non-productive and parasitic activities: currency speculation, derivatives,  gambling on the stock exchange, property, take-overs, and also the systematic  looting of the state in all countries under the name of privatisation. All this  is preparing the way for a deep slump on a world scale in the next period.</p>
  <p>
As far as &ldquo;globalisation&rdquo; is concerned, this was also dealt with in the  Communist Manifesto. Even at the present time, it is a moot point whether the  degree of integration of the world economy is, in fact, greater in the period  between 1870 and 1914. It is true that the international division of labour and  world trade have enormously expanded in the past period. This was the principal  motor force of capitalist development for a whole period after 1945, acting as  a colossal stimulus on investment and production. But, as we have explained in  previous documents (see &ldquo;A New Stage in the World Revolution&rdquo;) this has now  reached its limits, and the expansion of world trade no longer has the same  effects. True, in search of extra profits, the bourgeoisie has invested large  sums of money in Asia and, to a lesser effect, in other &ldquo;emerging markets&rdquo;  (Latin America, parts of Eastern Europe). Marx explains that one of the means  whereby the capitalists can combat the tendency of the rate of profit to fall  is precisely through world trade and specifically, trade with the colonial  countries which involves the exchange of more labour for less.</p>
  <p>
Here a similar process occurs as when capitalists invest in a new branch of  technology which cheapens products and enables them to capture a large share of  the market. Those who get in first can make huge profits for a while. But this cannot  last. Motivated by the greed for super profits, other capitalists pile in,  causing a glut of production. The rate of profit again falls to the average.  Eventually the over-investment outstrips the limited demand, giving rise to  over-production. Prices stagnate and then fall. Instead of a falling rate of  profit, we saw a fall in the mass of profit, producing a slump which will last  until all the surplus product is disposed of, along with the closure of  factories, mass unemployment and the forcible destruction of the means of  production that eventually creates the possibility for new markets and fields  of investments and a new boom.</p>
  <p>
The investments in South East Asia and China have enormously developed the  economy. The question is, has that resolved the contradictions of capitalism?  On the contrary. The increased participation on world markets, the sweeping  aside of all barriers to the movement of capital, merely reproduces the old  contradictions on a higher level and in a more intense fashion, on a world  scale. What is being prepared here is a truly global crisis of capitalism,  which will hit the economies of Asia, Africa and Latin America with the  greatest violence, enormously aggravating all the tensions that have been  accumulating over decades. The present economic crisis in Asia is a warning of  what is coming on a world scale in the next period. The theory of the permanent  revolution does not say that you cannot have important economic development in  a colonial country. It says precisely the opposite. What it does say is that  the colonial bourgeoisie is not capable of resolving the problems of society.  And here we see that this is absolutely true.</p>
  <p>
The reason why the Americans have begun to attack China for its record on  workers&rsquo; rights, and labour conditions and wages in South Korea is because  these countries have built up their industry to the point where it is competing  with Western products on world markets. But wages in South Korea are already  too high, from the capitalist standpoint, compared to other regional  competitors. In fact, South Korean companies, even before the crisis, were  already moving to lower wage countries like Indonesia, Philippines and  Malaysia. This created an explosive situation in South Korea, where the bosses  are compelled to launch an attack on the wages, conditions and jobs of the  workers. This led to an outburst of the class struggle in the form of the  general strike of December of 1996/January 1997. These developments mark the  awakening of the Asian proletariat, immensely strengthened by the development  of industry in the last period. In fact, it is incorrect to call South Korea a  colonial country now. This is now the eighth strongest economy in the world and  its companies are investing abroad even in South Wales where labour costs are  now actually lower than in South Korea.</p>
  <p>
As shown in South Korea, in all these countries the working class is in a  position to play a leading role, provided it has a revolutionary leadership.  The workers in South Korea have shown time and again their determination to  fight against capitalism but time and again their leaders have let them down.  Even the leaders of the illegal and militant trade union confederation, the  KCTU, accepted class collaboration policies and signed the IMF tripartite agreements  with the government and the bosses allowing mass lay-offs, at the beginning of  the crisis. But the rank and file of the union immediately called a national  meeting of workplace representatives in which the agreement was voted down and  the leadership replaced by a more militant one made up of the representatives  of the metal workers union. This was a significant development which shows how  the mass organisations will be shaken to the foundations in one country after  another as the crisis develops.</p>
  <p>
But not even this more radical leadership was up to the tasks, as shown in  the recent movement in the beginning of June, when after a 200,000-strong  warning strike, they cancelled the planned all-out general strike. This has led  to a further ferment of criticism in the rank and file. This example  illustrates the fact that, as militant as a union might be, in circumstances  like this, if it is not armed with a political programme of socialist change in  society, it is bound to fall under the pressure of capitalism. The situation in  South Korea only admits two solutions: either the workers take over the  chaebols or the policy of Kim Dae Jung must be swallowed whole&#8212;the &ldquo;whole  nation makes sacrifices to get out of the crisis&rdquo; (i.e. the workers carry the  burden of the crisis through mass redundancies, wage cuts, etc.). There is no  middle way.</p>
  <h4><strong>Marx on colonialism</strong> </h4>
  <p>
Marx wrote very little about the colonial revolution, because at that stage  the question of a socialist revolution in a backward country did not apply. But  in the third volume of Capital there is a very interesting section on  colonialism and the role of investment in the colonial countries which is  completely applicable to the present situation. Marx explains, in the section  on the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, that one of the ways in which  capitalism combats this tendency is a) by participating in world markets, which  is precisely what they are doing; and b) specifically through colonial trade  and colonial investment. How does that work? The capitalists who invest in  colonial countries, particularly the first ones, can benefit from a very low  organic composition of capital: low wages, industries with a high labour  content, and the way that this exploitation works through world trade is that  they exchange less labour for more.</p>
  <p>
In the same way that the first capitalists to invest in new machinery can  get an advantage, the first capitalists to invest in Asia obtained fabulous  rates of profit, as we have already mentioned. These backward countries with  huge populations, hungry for investment, Western industry and technique, seemed  to open up an endless vista for expansion and profit-making. The same illusion  has been repeated many times in the past. In the last century, Engels commented  ironically on the illusions of the Manchester cotton manufacturers who believed  that the China market (yes, China!) would guarantee a market for their products  that would last forever. That dream ended in a slump, as it always does. But  for a time, on the basis of low wages and new technology, huge  profits&#8212;super-profits&#8212;were possible. But now all these economies have  collapsed and are in deep recession. This has already sparked off the  Indonesian revolution and important movements in other countries. The limits of  Asia have been reached (from a capitalist point of view, of course, in  practice, the development of Asia has scarcely begun.)</p>
  <p>
The huge amounts of investment have produced a vast glut of commodities  which cannot be sold. The rapid expansion of capitalist production in Asia (the  only area where such spectacular results were achieved) have come into  collision with the limited purchasing power of the masses. Incidentally, low  wages, in and of themselves are not necessarily a source of profits. There can  be other factors which off-set the lower wages, for example low productivity.  Many of these countries do not have a sufficiently large skilled working class,  as is the case of Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, etc. In addition to this there  are taxes, corruption, bad infrastructure, transport costs to the European and  US markets, etc. In any case, labour costs are rising in all these countries.  If they want to compete, even amongst each other, they must drive wages down.  But the Korean bourgeois are faced with a very strong working class which is  not willing to surrender its gains without a fight.</p>
  <p>
Fabulous profits have been made from investment in South East Asia in the  last ten years. And also in China, which is a very peculiar case, because  although it remains a deformed workers&rsquo; state, it has encouraged the  development of capitalism in certain areas. Incidentally, Lenin intended to do  something similar in the 1920s when he offered foreign investors all sorts of  concessions, but always with the workers&rsquo; state remaining firmly in control.  The idea was to benefit from the modern technology which could have only been  developed in the Soviet Union at a greater cost. But that was not possible  because Russia was a fundamentally healthy workers state and instead of  investing in it, the capitalists wanted to destroy the Soviet state. However,  if the Bolsheviks could have got the investment they would have accepted it.</p>
  <p>
In China the situation is different since the bureaucracy, and not the  working class, is in control and they do not represent a fundamental threat to  capitalism world-wide. Therefore, the capitalists feel that this is a regime  one can do business with! In fact, China has played the role they initially  envisaged for Russia in the last period. There has been quite a lot of investment  and economic growth has been impressive. (Incidentally, this economic growth,  made possible by the participation in world markets, illustrates the madness of  Stalin&rsquo;s and Mao&rsquo;s policy of autarchy.) The large amount of foreign investment  in China gave rise to illusions on the part of the Western capitalists, and  even among some Marxists. Could China and Asia open up a new period of  capitalist expansion like the one that followed World War Two?</p>
  <p>
As a matter of fact, most of the investment in China has been limited to a  few coastal areas around the Special Economic Zones and has created enormous  imbalances and contradictions. Millions of peasants have moved from the more  backward rural areas to the fast-growing urban centres creating a surplus  labour force of millions. This could be maintained to a certain extent while  the economy was growing at double-digit rates. But now that the economy is  starting to slow down all the contradictions will come to the fore. There have  already been numerous reports of riots involving tens of thousands both in  rural and urban areas, and this is only the beginning.</p>
  <p>
To make matters worse, the collapse of the South East Asian economies and  the steady fall of the Japanese yen have already cut most of the competitive  advantage off Chinese exports and will eventually force it to devalue its  currency&#8212;the only one which seemed stable during the SE Asian collapse. The  level of bad debts of the Chinese banks is even greater than in the rest of the  region and a serious economic crisis is only a matter of time. This will plunge  the country into even deeper trouble. The Chinese authorities tried to suppress  all news of the Indonesian revolution or presented it merely as an anti-Chinese  riot. In 1989, before the Tian An Men Square massacre it was mainly the  students who participated in the movement. Workers and peasants remained mainly  passive as their economic situation was still acceptable. This time it will be  completely different, and even as we have seen in Indonesia, a movement starting  with the students could lead to a mass uprising. This will be in the last  instance what will decide the fate of China&rsquo;s pro-capitalist reforms. Faced  with a movement of this character and an economic crisis, sections of the  bureaucracy are bound to abandon the road to capitalism even if it is only out  of pure self-interest.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>China also facing revolution</strong> </h4>
  <p>
The capitalists try to comfort themselves with the thought that at least  China has not yet plunged into crisis. But China cannot stand aloof from the  general crisis in Asia. On the contrary, everything seems to indicate that  China is on the eve of revolutionary developments. The attempt to speed up the  process of &ldquo;reform&rdquo; (i.e. capitalist counterrevolution) in China under  conditions of capitalist crisis is provoking colossal social and economic  dislocation. Deng was always cautious, moving slowly towards denationalisation,  while ensuring the continued monopoly of political power in the hands of the  bureaucracy. But now the ruling clique, dominated by the pro-capitalist wing,  wants to speed things up. The result is a catastrophe for the Chinese people  and an explosion of the class struggle. Pro-market reform in the villages has  given rise to extreme inequality and a polarisation between a small minority  who have done well and the big majority who have been impoverished. Millions  have fled to the towns and coastal areas where industry, despite the rapid rate  of growth, is unable to absorb them. At least 150 million are unemployed. The  attempt to deregulate and privatise state-owned industry will cause this figure  to multiply several times over. The slowdown in Asia has already begun to hit  Chinese exports which largely accounted for the high growth rates in the last  few years, causing a slowdown. This will have the most severe effects in China,  not only economically, but socially and politically.</p>
  <p>
The fall in the value of the yen has caused alarm in Beijing. The  devaluation worries come when unemployment is increasing rapidly. Economic  growth could fall below 6.5 per cent by the end of the year, nowhere near the  official 8 per cent target. China needs high growth to absorb the more than 5  million workers expected to lose jobs this year as a result of the  restructuring of companies. The biggest threat to China&rsquo;s mid- and low-tech  companies is not Japan itself, which exports high-end goods. What the Chinese  are worried about is how a Japanese devaluation could affect Korea. If the yen  weakens to 150 to the dollar, the Korean won is likely to be devalued in an  effort to make Korean industry competitive. That would mean increased  competition for Chinese companies already struggling to fend off the Koreans at  home and in other markets. In China&rsquo;s steel industry, for example, profits are  down, in part because of new competition from the Koreans. That&rsquo;s also true in  the petrochemical industry, a sector in which prices have dropped 20 per cent  since October. &ldquo;There will be further pressure on domestic corporations,&rdquo;  predicts Andy Xie, an economist with Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.</p>
  <p>
Despite the confident claims that China will not devalue the renminbi, it  is hard to see how this can be avoided in the next period. And a devaluation of  the renminbi (or yuan, as it is also called) would provoke a devastating chain  of competitive devaluations in Asia and beyond and possibly drag the whole  world into recession. The furious attempts by America and Europe to put  pressure on Japan to reflate is directly linked to fears about China. As  Business Week pointed out: &ldquo;With US business leaders growing increasingly  uneasy about the soaring dollar and Chinese leaders pressing for relief&#8212;to  prevent a devaluation of the renminbi&#8212;Treasure officials began pondering an  intervention over the weekend of June 13-14. After intense consultations with  their Japanese counterparts over the next 72 hours, Rubin &amp; Co. settled on  a $2 billion government purchase of yen.</p>
  <p class="quote">
&ldquo;The biggest impetus was the mounting anxiety in Asia as the yen plummeted  in the first two weeks of June. Especially alarmed were Chinese officials who  feared their grand economic plans would be undone by a tumbling yen. The  Chinese started lobbying the US privately for an intervention in advance of  Clinton&rsquo;s arrival in Beijing on June 25. &lsquo;The Chinese have been complaining  that we haven&rsquo;t been doing enough to stop the depreciation of the yen,&rsquo; which  makes Chinese exports less competitive, says a top Administration official.  Meanwhile, public statements showed Beijing preparing the way for their own  devaluation. Chinese sources indicate that Beijing finance officials figured a  yen weaker than 150 spelled disaster and would force a defensive action.&rdquo;  (BusinessWeek, 29/6/98.)</p>
  <p>
The perspective of a deepening economic crisis places the class struggle  firmly on the agenda in China. Already there have been big movements. According  to the French press agency Agence France-Presse (Hong Kong):</p>
  <p class="quote">
&ldquo;Sporadic worker unrest has been on the rise across China, as government  reforms forcing loss-making state-owned enterprises to profit or perish take  hold. Hundreds of firms drowning in red ink have been allowed to go bankrupt,  and the remainder are laying off millions of surplus workers to raise  efficiency. The state sector will shed an estimated 11 million urban jobs this  year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
The same source states that: &ldquo;Hundreds of retired workers from a state-run  factory in central Wuhan city marched on their former enterprise Tuesday to  protest unpaid pensions. The general manager&rsquo;s office of the China Number-One  Metallurgical Company denied any demonstration took place, but a security guard  told AFP that between 100 and 200 people gathered in front of the factory. He  said the ex-workers, mostly pensioners, were allowed to meet company officials  before a noisy protest could develop and then left nearly three hours later.  Contacted by telephone, a retired employee who chose not to participate, Li  Qingrong, said the demonstration involved around 200 workers. The 71-year-old  said in the last three months, the company had sent him only one partial  monthly payment instead of the required three of 400 yuan (48 dollars) each.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
The degree of worker unrest in China is widespread&#8212;although there is a  conspiracy of silence about this in the Western press. In an article entitled &lsquo;Labor  Turmoil Involving 100,000 Workers in Four Cities. A True Account of Workers  Unrest and Riot in Heilongjiang&rsquo;, a Hong Kong paper reports: &ldquo;From 25 November  to 3 December, workers&rsquo; and shopkeepers&rsquo; strikes took place one after another  in the cities of Qiqihar, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, and Yichun in Heilongjiang  province. Strikers besieged party and government office buildings, locked up  enterprise&rsquo;s party committee offices and plant managers&rsquo; offices, set fire to  party and government officials&rsquo; cars and public security vehicles, stormed  public security bureaux, detention houses, and airports, and took over airport  control towers, and so on. They even clashed with public security and armed  police personnel who were sent to the scene to quell the strikes. Casualties  were reported in Jiamusi and Yichun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
According to an internal report released by the Heilongjiang provincial  public security department on 10 December 1997, nearly 105,000 staff members,  workers, cadres, and urban residents participated or were involved in the  turmoil which burst out in the four cities of Qiqihar, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, and  Yichun, during the week from 25 November to 3 December. As the turmoil turned  into riot, more than 70 people were injured; 25 public security and armed  police personnel who rushed to the scenes to keep order were injured when  assaulted by stones, iron-made objects, hunting rifles, and ordinary rifles,  and four of these policemen died as a result of their injuries. This official  report made no mention of casualties on the part of workers and ordinary  people, but disclosed that a total of more than 150 people were arrested during  the week of unrest and riot.</p>
  <p>
The Heilongjiang Provincial CPC Committee and provincial government noted  that there were complicated political factors behind the unrest and riot, some  of the incidents were &ldquo;well engineered and organised by hostile elements who  had sneaked into party and government organisations, and some were stirred up  by outside hostile forces.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
The provincial party committee and government also pointed out that the  turmoil was stirred up in the wake of personnel lay-offs as a result of  enterprise reform, corruption among enterprise cadres, unhealthy work styles  among some cadres, and some contingent incidents such as traffic accidents. The  provincial party committee and government also attributed the riot to &ldquo;local  party and government leaders overlooking the complicated conditions of the  local community and their lost vigilance against latent hostile forces.&rdquo; In  other words, the strikers were joined or perhaps even led by members of the  Communist Party. This confirms what we have always maintained&#8212;that, once the  working class begins to move, the lower ranks of the bureaucracy would come  over.</p>
  <p>
Another report states that: &ldquo;On 29 November, the staff and workers of the  locomotive plant and timber processing plant went on strike and held rallies.  They were supported by the workers from seven other state-owned enterprises in  Qiqihar (of which two heavy-duty machinery plants, two electric appliance  plants, and an integrated dairy complex belong to the foreign trade sector).  More than 30,000 staff members and workers, together with their family members,  joined the strikes and attended the rallies. Workers from some enterprises put  forth such slogans as: &lsquo;all power and property belong to the people,&rsquo; strike  down power, economic, and political exploitation and oppression.&rsquo; The staff and  workers of United Timber Processing Plant sealed the plant manager&rsquo;s office and  financial department with paper strips. They dashed into the plant party  committee secretary&rsquo;s office and asked the plant manager and party committee  secretary to produce a statement itemising the plant&rsquo;s financial expenses. They  also resisted public security officers who came to arrest them. The confrontation  lasted from 1300 to about 2200. Public security officials called armed police  to the site to maintain order, and place the area under control, and to arrest  the strikers. Some 600 public security and armed police clashed with nearly  2,000 staff members and workers. More than 20 people were injured and more than  30 staff members and workers were arrested. As of 1 December Qiqihar United  Timber Processing Plant had not resumed production.&rdquo; (Hong Kong Cheng Ming in  Chinese, 1/1/98.)</p>

This is highly significant. The struggles of the Chinese workers, to judge  from these reports, are not only increasing, but tend to take on an  insurrectionary character. The workers and peasants have passed through the  school of capitalism, and have drawn the necessary conclusions. The workers  oppose both capitalism and bureaucracy: &ldquo;All power and property belong to the  people!&rdquo; This is the slogan of the political revolution in China. We must be  prepared for sudden turns and explosive developments all over Asia, but  particularly in China. The development of the productive forces has enormously  strengthened the Chinese proletariat. A revolutionary movement in China under  present-day conditions would not repeat the position of 1949, when the working  class was far weaker and still not fully recovered from the defeats of the  past. The class balance of forces has been completely transformed. If a Marxist  party existed in China, there would be the possibility of a classical  proletarian revolution on the lines of October 1917, in which the proletariat  would put itself at the head of the multi-millioned peasant masses. The  revolutionary potential of China was shown in outline by the Tian An Men Square  events a decade ago. That heroic movement of the youth was defeated because it  did not receive the active support of the workers in time. The economy was  still going forward, and the ruling bureaucracy still had a margin of support.  Now all that has changed. A new revolutionary movement of the youth is  inevitable, and this time it will not be isolated. Once it is armed with the  scientific programme of Marxism, such a movement would be invincible. A  political revolution in China would shake the world. It would place revolution  on the order of the day not only in the rest of Asia, but in Russia and also in  the advanced capitalist countries. The destiny of the world revolution is  therefore intimately bound up with the fate of China.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>Indonesia and the permanent revolution</strong> </h4>
  <p>
The present discussion is not at all of an academic character, but a  burning issue for today&rsquo;s revolutionary developments in the Third World. The  revolution has already started in Indonesia and this is a fact of decisive  importance, not just for Asia, but potentially for the entire world. In the  stormy period before the Second World War, at different times, Trotsky said  that the key to the world situation was to be found in different  countries&#8212;Germany, France, Spain etc. He insisted that the whole International  should pay special attention to these developments, following them on a regular  basis, drawing the necessary conclusions, political, tactical and  organisational, mainly for the sake of educating the cadres, but also, to the  degree that it was possible, to intervene. At that time, the small forces of  Trotskyism were weak and isolated. The colossal strength of Stalinism on a  world scale effectively blocked the road of the genuine Bolshevik-Leninists to  the most advanced and revolutionary workers and youth in the ranks of the  Communist Parties. Now this is no longer the case. The collapse of Stalinism  has completely transformed the situation. The best of the Communist workers and  youth are looking for ideas. They are striving to find the revolutionary road,  and we must help them to find it.</p>
  <p>
For decades our tendency has struggled to defend the banner, the programme,  methods and traditions of the October Revolution and Bolshevism. We were forced  to swim against the stream. Now, for the first time, we are beginning to swim  with the current. The fact that our ideas are getting a favourable echo among  Communists in Indonesia even now, at an early stage in the revolution, is an  indication of what will be possible in the period that opens up before us. The  important fact to grasp is that this would not have been possible ten years  ago. It is a symptom that the whole situation is beginning to change on a world  scale.</p>
  <p>
It is very important to understand what the theory of the permanent  revolution means in practice and what concrete slogans should be advanced by  revolutionaries in these conditions. On the one hand it is important to defend  democratic slogans and demands (as the PRD is correctly doing). But at the same  time the main task should be to explain that the national bourgeoisie is  completely unable to carry them through. The workers and youth must be educated  in a spirit of implacable opposition to class collaboration, to mistrust even  the most radical-sounding bourgeois politicians of the &ldquo;opposition&rdquo;, and to  fight for an independent proletarian revolutionary line. Of course, it will be  necessary to make temporary alliances for practical purposes with  non-proletarian forces. But in the main these will be the petit bourgeoisie and  peasantry, not the bourgeois Liberals. Secondly, the prior condition of any  agreements is the maintenance at all times of a clear revolutionary programme  and policy. The Bolshevik slogan was always: &ldquo;March separately and strike  together!&rdquo; There must be no programmatic blocs, no mixing up of programmes and  banners. The only kind of unity that we want is unity in struggle. Whoever is  willing to fight against Suhartoism and imperialism in deeds not in words is  welcome to do so. But we do not drop a single point in our programme to please  anybody, and, while supporting even the smallest progressive action of the petit-bourgeois  democrats, reserve the right to criticise their shortcomings, their hesitations  and backsliding before the masses. Only by such means can we help them to  overcome their hesitations and adopt a consistent democratic position.</p>
  <h4>
<strong>Which way forward for Indonesia?</strong> </h4>
  <p>
It goes without saying that a revolutionary party in Indonesia would  agitate for democratic demands (legalisation of all political parties, trade  unions and student&rsquo;s organisations, the right to strike, the repeal of all  repressive laws, etc.), and as part of this would call for a Constituent  Assembly to be democratically elected. While agitating for these demands, a  revolutionary party would start to build committees of action (that is soviets  with another name), based in every factory, working class neighbourhood,  peasant village and university campus. These democratically elected committees  of action should be linked at local level through democratically elected and  recallable representatives. This linking up of the committees would eventually  have to reach the national level, thus becoming a counter power to the official  existing power, be it the Habibie government or a government of the democratic  bourgeois opposition. The building of committees (soviets) is key because  without them the masses have no way of expressing in a direct and immediate  manner the changes in their political awareness, their increasing frustration  with the inability of the democratic bourgeois politicians to solve their most  urgent needs: food, land and jobs.</p>
  <p>
At the same time we demand the immediate expropriation of the wealth of  Suharto, his family and all the other cronies and collaborators, including  those who now try to dress themselves up as &ldquo;democrats.&rdquo; Such a demand would  get an immediate echo among the masses, not only of the workers, but among the  mass of peasants, middle classes and even small business people who have been  ruined by the ruling clique. Moreover, it would signify the nationalisation of  most of the Indonesian economy. There must be no question of compensation.  These wealthy parasites have looted and robbed the people for long enough! And  why stop at this? If the slogan of the national-democratic revolution means  anything at all, it must signify a radical break with imperialism. Repudiate  all foreign debts and deals with the IMF! Nationalise the property of the  imperialists! Only such a programme can begin to make a reality of the  national-democratic revolution. Anything less means a sell-out of the  Indonesian people to imperialism. But such a programme would signify, in  practice, the passing-over of the bourgeois-democratic revolution to the  socialist revolution.</p>
  <p>
Under present-day conditions, it is impossible to separate them. A  consistent struggle for national-democratic demands leads inevitably to the  expropriation of the imperialists and their local office-boys, and thus, the  expropriation of the basic points of support for capitalism in Indonesia. Under  the democratic control and administration of the working people, the  nationalisation of the means of production would be the first condition for  putting an end to the economic crisis and thus preventing the catastrophe which  menaces Indonesia. This is a question of life and death, since all the  bourgeois commentators are agreed that in a few months, if drastic steps are  not taken, the government of Jakarta will run out of money and imports of food  will cease.</p>
  <p>
The reforms of the Habibie government mostly have a cosmetic character, and  do not touch the root causes of the problems facing the country. The wealth of  the Suharto family remains untouched. None of the criminals responsible for  past atrocities have been put on trial. Newspapers still have to be licensed.  Political prisoners still languish in gaol, although some have been released.  The national question remains unsolved. Habibie&rsquo;s offer to the oppressed people  of East Timor of a &ldquo;special status&rdquo;&#8212;like Jakarta&#8212;is an insult to their  national aspirations. Their leader, Xanana Gusmao, remains in prison. Above  all, the poverty and exploitation of millions of workers and peasants remains  with no perspective in sight except more unemployment and hunger. And Habibie  just smiles at the cameras and asks for &ldquo;more time&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>
The Muslim &ldquo;oppositionist&rdquo; Amien Rais has already shown his true colours  and is, in effect, backing Habibie. For her part, Megawati Sukarnoputri is  waiting for the power to drop into her lap like a rotten apple. All these  leaders do nothing to mobilise the masses in struggle, because they are  terrified of the mass movement. They could easily take power, but want to stay  out of government as long as possible because they know they have no programme  to solve the burning problems of the masses. The bourgeois politicians can  afford to wait, but the masses cannot. The people will be faced with mass  unemployment, poverty and starvation. By withdrawing their money, the  imperialists hope to teach the Indonesian people a lesson and show them who is  boss. A serious challenge, which demands a serious answer! But not one of the  so-called bourgeois opposition leaders is prepared to pick up the gauntlet. The  economic crisis is continually worsening. In the first quarter, the economy  shrank by no less than 8.5 per cent. The rupiah, which has already lost 80 per  cent of its value against the dollar, is still vulnerable, and likely to fall  still further, forcing prices upwards. Inflation is expected to reach 80 per  cent this year. The Economist (6/6/98) comments that the collapsing currency &ldquo;has  also forced Indonesian companies to reschedule a mountain of some $80 billion  of private sector foreign debt,&rdquo; but adds that &ldquo;Even after they reached  agreement with their creditors on June 4th, and even if the IMF, as expected,  soon resumes doling out its rescue funds, confidence will not magically return.  The banking system is still bust.</p>
  <p class="quote">
&ldquo;Indonesia faces, in a particularly vicious form, a downward spiral seen in  Thailand and, to a lesser extent, Malaysia. Interest rates are high&#8212;partly to  stop further runs on the currencies, partly because governments are borrowing  heavily to finance the emergency transfusions they are giving ailing banks.  High interest rates and a drying up of credit in turn mean more companies are  unable to repay debt. So banks&rsquo; non-performing loans rise inexorably and  governments take over more financial institutions, using up even more liquidity  to keep them alive.</p>
  <p class="quote">
&ldquo;Matters are made worse by the new weakness of the Japanese yen. It puts  more competitive pressure on South-East Asia&rsquo;s currencies, which, with the  exception of the rupiah, have no more of an edge against the yen now than they  did three years ago. It also raises fears that China may devalue. In a nervous  climate, the baht, the Malaysian ringgit and the Philippine peso have begun to  slide again after months of relative stability.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
The general crisis in Asia, despite all the optimistic predictions, shows  no sign of being resolved. On the contrary. As this extract shows, it will get  worse in the next few months, and maybe years, raising the real possibility of  a slump in Japan which could be the signal for a slump on a world scale. such a  development would have profound social and political effects everywhere. Even  without a slump, the economic crisis is having a serious effect in all the  countries of Asia, particularly Indonesia. Food shortages are already being  felt in the east of the country and may soon spread to the rest.</p>
  <p>
So what is the policy being put forward by the PRD (which is in effect the  Indonesian Communist Party operates)? In a press release of May 25th, 1998,  that is after Suharto had resigned and been replaced by Habibie, the PRD, after  correctly stating that this was just a manoeuvre and should not stop the  protests puts forward a number of demands: </p>
      <ol type="disc">
        <li>&ldquo;Repeal Five Political Laws of 1985 </li>
        <li>Ending to Dual Function of ABRI </li>
        <li>Responsibility and Trial for       Suharto </li>
        <li>Confiscation of the cronies&rsquo; business assets </li>
        <li>Confiscation of the wealth of corrupt       officials </li>
        <li>Free, democratic,       multi-party election </li>
        <li>Release of political       prisoners&rdquo; </li>
      </ol>
      <p>We would agree with all the points except with 6) where we would put  forward the idea of a democratic Constituent Assembly. The idea of a  Constituent Assembly has been raised in a somewhat confused form by the PRD  under the name of an &ldquo;independent people&rsquo;s council&rdquo;. The main problem with this  is that the confused way in which they put forward this slogan leads them to  make decisive blunders in the key moments. The bourgeois opposition leaders  created a coalition organisation called precisely &ldquo;people&rsquo;s council&rdquo; thus  leaving the PRD activists without a clear alternative to the position put  forward to the opportunist bourgeois &ldquo;opposition&rdquo;. The lack of theoretical  clarity of the PRD leaders led them to issue the following appeal to bourgeois  opposition leaders during the mass demonstrations which led to Suharto&rsquo;s  resignation:</p>
  <p>
  &ldquo;To Megawati Sukarnoputri, ousted leader of the Indonesian Democratic  Party], Amien Rais head of the Muslim mass organisation Muhammadiyah], Budiman  Sudjatmiko jailed chairperson of the PRD], Sri-Bintang Pamukas jailed  chairperson of the Indonesian United Development Party and others. It is time  for you to state your readiness to replace Suharto. This must be done soon  because Suharto is no longer wanted by the people and is ready to step down.&rdquo;  What does this mean in practice? That the leaders of the PRD are begging the  bourgeois opposition to take power. But events have demonstrated that neither  Rais nor Sukarnoputra are in any hurry to take power, preferring to leave it in  the hands of Habibie. The &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; is propping up Habibie, that reactionary  crony of Suharto, who, in turn, is doing everything in his power to protect his  old boss and his family, and to leave as much as possible of the old regime  untouched. But the mass of workers, peasants and students will never accept  this. They did not fight against Suharto merely to see the continuation of the  old system with just a few cosmetic changes. The bourgeois opposition leaders  are acting as just the left cover for Habibie, who represents the continuation  of the old regime. The PRD must not act as a left cover for the bourgeois  opposition! They must be exposed before the masses for the treacherous role  they are playing. The PRD must fight to win the masses away from the pernicious  influence of the bourgeois pseudo-opposition.</p>
  <p>
        This situation has striking parallels with the February revolution in  Russia. The masses took to the streets and defeated the hated tsarist regime  and the democratic bourgeois jumped on the bandwagon and formed the Provisional  government. This is a normal development, in every revolution. The bourgeois  try to rob the masses of the fruits of their victory, obtaining by fraud and  trickery what the old regime could not defend by force. At the start of every  revolution, there is a phase of democratic illusions, a sort of carnival in  which the natural rejoicing of the masses at the overthrow of the old regime is  accompanied by a general intoxication of democratic phrases and speeches that  seek to conceal the reality that, in fundamentals, nothing has changed. The old  exploiters and oppressors of the people still hold onto power and are moving  the threads behind the scenes, hatching all kinds of plots and conspiracies  with the tops of the army, waiting for the masses to become tired and fall back  into inactivity before staging a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat.</p>
  <p>
        All this is a well-known feature of revolutions. But it is necessary for  the revolutionary party and its leadership to remain separate and apart from  this democratic farce and explain to the masses that the problem has not been  resolved&#8212;that there is still serious work to be done. as soon as he heard the  news of the overthrow of the tsar, Lenin, still an exile in Switzerland  immediately telegraphed the following message to the Bolsheviks in Petrograd:</p>
  <p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Our tactic: absolute lack of confidence; no support to the new government;  suspect Kerensky especially; arming of the proletariat the sole guarantee;  immediate elections to the Petrograd Duma; no rapprochement with other parties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
        Unfortunately, the Bolshevik leaders in Petrograd (at that time, Stalin and  Kamenev amongst others) took no notice of Lenin&rsquo;s advice. They were drunk with  democratic illusions, affected by the general mood and the constant appeals for  &ldquo;unity of all democratic forces.&rdquo; Against Lenin&rsquo;s advice, they supported the  bourgeois Provisional government. In the same way, the leaders of the PRD  appeal to the bourgeois opposition leaders in Indonesia to take power, not  understanding the real nature and role of these leaders.</p>
  <p>
        Fortunately, this was not the end of the story in Russia. Lenin managed to  change the course of the party after his arrival from exile in April 1917,  although only after a sharp internal struggle. The policy of the Bolsheviks  from then on was to &ldquo;patiently explain&rdquo; to the mass of the workers and peasants  that the only way to get their most immediate demands was for the soviets to  take power and not to put any trust in the Liberal bourgeois. This issue is  obviously under discussion within the PRD itself as it is proved by a statement  issued a few days latter by the PRD in reply to a left wing intellectual who  was proposing a transitional government of opposition forces and &ldquo;democratic&rdquo;  army generals. First of all the statement correctly asks who mobilised the people:</p>
  <p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Who were the leaders of the crowds? Who mobilised them? Amien Rais,  Megawati, or Gus Dur? Or was it the activists who had been struggling to start  various actions by dozens of people, that then became actions of hundreds, then  thousands, then tens of thousands, etc.? There were many of them and they were  not given wide exposure in the mass media.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Those people, especially in Jakarta, were without leaders. That was why  they lost direction and could easily be provoked into rioting. Did Amien Rais  direct them to launch a peaceful action, marching toward the Parliament  building, or the Merdeka Palace, or the state radio station? Or, did Megawati,  Gus Dur, or other figures do any of these tasks?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
        These observations are one hundred percent correct and go right to the  heart of the matter. If it was not the bourgeois democratic opposition who led  the people in the streets, why should they be entrusted with the leadership of  the masses?:</p>
  <p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Then, who should represent these people in this transitional government? For  me, the people have to choose the leaders themselves. The only way to do it is  by establishing people&rsquo;s councils from the lowest level (maybe the Kampung,  campus, factory, offices, etc.). After electing the leaders at this lowest  level, they can move to higher level, etc. up to the national level. This way a  genuine leader will come out, i.e., a leader who is indeed a representation  from below.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
        This is a programme which we would wholeheartedly support, and it proves  that within the PRD there must be many honest activists looking for a real  revolutionary programme. If the PRD was to adopt a programme of no confidence  in the liberal bourgeois and start to create committees in every factory,  campus and neighbourhood this, with time, would enormously increase its  authority amongst the masses, preparing the basis for a transfer of power to  the workers and peasants as did the work of the Bolshevik party in the period  from February to October. It is essential that we establish contact with this  layer as quickly as possible to assist in the development of a genuinely  revolutionary current which, in the prevailing conditions, could rapidly  acquire a mass character.</p>
  <p>
        The programme of democratic demands and for the nationalisation of the  economy should be combined with an internationalist appeal to the people&rsquo;s of  South East Asia and the proletariat in the West to defend the Indonesian  revolution. This is the second part of the theory of the permanent revolution.  Trotsky stated that the proletariat can be victorious in a backward country  and, starting with the bourgeois-democratic tasks of the revolution, go over to  the socialist tasks. But, in the end, the necessary condition for holding onto  power is the extension of the revolution to the advanced industrialised countries.  The crisis of capitalism is creating favourable conditions for the extension of  the revolution throughout the whole of Asia. In this process, the Indonesian  revolution is the key. Suharto&rsquo;s resignation has had an enormous effect in the  whole region and internationally. The process will be protracted, but a  victorious revolution in Indonesia would spread like wildfire all over Asia,  where the conditions faced by the masses in Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea,  etc. are much the same, and would also have an electrifying effect in the West,  especially if the Indonesian workers come to power on the basis of a classical  proletarian revolution led by a genuine Marxist party with an internationalist  policy and perspective.</p>
  <p>
        The PRD now occupies a decisive position. It has the activists who in  reality led the overthrow of Suharto. This is a huge achievement, but it is  only half the task. The greater half still remains. In order to fulfil this  task one thing is required. The fate of the Indonesian revolution depends on  the building of a genuine Leninist leadership, armed with the necessary  perspectives for the revolution. We stand on the basis of complete class  independence! Any other policy will inevitably lead to the road of compromise  and ultimately the shipwreck of the revolution. The entire history of the  colonial revolution, and especially of Indonesia, is proof of this. Above all  it is necessary to understand the limitations of a revolution in a backward  country, even one as big as Indonesia. The fate of Russia and China are a stern  warning of what happened to the attempts to build &ldquo;socialism in one country.&rdquo;  It is necessary to prepare the working class for the taking of power, but it is  also necessary to explain that the destiny of the Indonesian revolution is  inseparably bound up with the perspective of revolution in the rest of Asia and  on a world scale. In 1848, drawing the conclusions from the defeat of the  revolution in Germany as a result of the betrayal of the bourgeois liberals,  the founders of scientific socialism, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, issued a  stirring appeal to the workers which retains all its force. This remains our  rallying-call and our fighting slogan today:</p>
  <p class="quote">&ldquo;But they themselves must do the utmost for their final victory by  clarifying their minds as to what their class interests are, by taking up their  position as an independent party as soon as possible and by not allowing  themselves to be seduceed for a single moment by the hypocritical phrases of  the democratic petty bourgeoisie into refraining from the independent  organisation of the party of the proletariat. Their battle cry must be: The  Revolution in Permanence.&rdquo; (K. Marx and F. Engels, Address to the CC of the  Communist League, March 1850, MESW, vol. 1, p. 185.)</p>
