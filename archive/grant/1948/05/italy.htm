The victory
of the Christian Democrats in the Italian elections marks a decisive set-back
for the Stalinists and a victory for Wall Street and the &#8220;Western Bloc&#8221; in the
struggle for the domination of Europe.
</p>
<p>
The polls
took place on the background of direct intervention by Anglo-American
Imperialism with threats to cut off all aid if the Italians voted for the
&#8220;Popular Front&#8221; lists dominated by the Communist Party. During the election
period America and Britain attempted to undermine the Stalinists by offering to
support the return of Trieste to Italy.
</p>
<p>
According to
reports front the State Department &#163;1,000,000 was spent from a special fund for
the purpose of supporting the struggle against &#8220;Communism&#8221; in Italy. Thus, as
after World War I, the weapon of food and other support is used to back up the
forces of counter-revolution in Europe.
</p>
<h4>Mass movements</h4>
<p class="fst">
When the
election campaign commenced the Allied reaction was not at all sure of the
victory of their puppets in Italy. Ever since the fall of Mussolini the
peninsula has been the scene of a tremendous upsurge on the part of the Italian
masses. The disillusionment following the &#8220;liberation&#8221; by Allied troops and the
ending of the war has been intense. Over the past two years the hungry Italian
masses have moved into action again and again. Strike struggles in Milan,
Turin, Genoa and other cities by the industrial workers have been followed by a
movement of the agricultural workers in the Po Valley and, emulating their
example of the landed labourers and peasants in the formerly backward south. In
September of last year a million agricultural workers struck in the Po Valley,
the strike spreading to Venezia, Rovigo and Ferrara Provinces. They were
followed by 900,000 steel workers who struck in the same month, and 40,000
technicians and employees in textiles. A million workers in Rome, Turin and
other large cities demonstrated against the hunger government. An agricultural
strike involving 30,000 to 60,000 took place near the capital and several
thousand peasants seized the land. Sympathy strikes of the workers took place
in Civitavecchia and Monte Rotondo.
</p>
<h4>C.P. pressed for coalition</h4>
<p class="fst">
However, as
late as September 26<sup>th</sup> in the Italian Parliament, Togliatti the C.P.
leader denied any revolutionary intentions and again pressed the demand for a
new coalition with the Christian Democrats. Clearly the C.P. was using the
revolutionary pressure of the masses for the purpose of arriving at an
agreement with Italian capitalism in the interests of Russian foreign policy.
Now this policy has reaped its reward in the election and has helped in the
turning of Italian capitalism firmly in the direction of Washington. It is
interesting to note that in the same debate the Uomo Qualunque, a semi-fascist
party also asked for the co-operation of the Christian Democrats.
</p>
<h4>Thrown out by government</h4>
<p class="fst">
The employers
and landowners having successfully used the Stalinists and Socialists in the
Cabinet in order to prevent the workers from seizing control, and having
rebuilt an apparatus of repression, at the behest of Wall Street, threw the
Stalinists and Socialists out of the Government. Meanwhile reaction had so
consolidated itself that the Fascists began their series of provocations and
murders against the militant elements within the working class. It was on this
basis that the workers replied by militant strike action against the premises
and organisations of the fascists. With the militant mood of the workers the
Government was powerless and it would have been possible for the Stalinists and
Socialists to overthrow the Government without any serious resistance.
</p>
<p>
But afraid of
the repercussions of direct revolutionary action on the part of the masses the
Stalinists held them back, hoping to come to power through a general election.
They wished to gain control from the top, supplemented by a movement from the
bottom so that they could maintain control of the movement throughout and
speedily bureaucratise and strangle it on the lines of the movement in
Czechoslovakia. Thus is the explanation of their failure to seize control
during the last couple of years when power was in their grasp.
</p>
<h4>Reaction united</h4>
<p class="fst">
The Vatican,
the industrialists and the landlords united in an intensive drive to rally
round the Christian Democrats. Using the events in Czechoslovakia as a basis,
they raised the danger of Stalinist totalitarianism as a means to scare the
middle class and indifferent and backward elements, large numbers of whom were
normally too apathetic even to vote, in order to drive them to the polls.
</p>
<p>
Despite the
chronic misery of the workers and peasants and the destitution of 1,500,000
unemployed they succeeded in this objective.
</p>
<p>
And their
success marks a definite change of relationship between the workers and the
capitalists, and the Stalinist bureaucracy and Anglo-American Imperialism since
the end of the war. Through the Marshall Plan the Imperialists hope to prop up
capitalism in the West and prepare for the future conflict with the Soviet
Union. This is the fruit of the policy of Stalinism in Western Europe.
</p>
<h4>Stalinists confuse the workers</h4>
<p class="fst">
Instead of
explaining the role of the Church and of the capitalists, instead of attacking
the hypocrisy of capitalist nationalism and putting forward the idea of
international Socialism, the Stalinists vied with the reaction in frenzied
chauvinism; this in their attacks on America. Instead of explaining the need
for workers&#8217; and peasants&#8217; control of the state, the Stalinists competed with
the capitalist parties in demagogy about constitutionalism, liberty and
democracy. Their attempts to paint the Czech crisis as one settled purely by
constitutional means could not impress any wavering elements as anything but
cynical lies. The Stalinists had voted in the Constituent Assembly for the
Lateran Treaty between Mussolini and the Vatican to become Part of the
Constitution. This makes Catholicism the state religion and gives the Church
special privileges in the schools and in the country. They guided the
revolutionary movement of the masses into harmless channels.
</p>
<h4>Popular Bloc had gained</h4>
<p class="fst">
However, with
the Stalinists and Socialists forced out of the Government and in opposition
during the last few months, there was a steady growth in the influence of the
Popular Bloc, composed of the Socialists supporting Nenni, the Communist Party
and some other small groupings. For the first time they began to penetrate the
backward peasant masses in the former stronghold of the Right Wing, the
Southern part of Italy. In the municipal elections of November 8<sup>th</sup>
in 143 municipalities including Rome, Naples, Genoa Turin, Florence and Palermo
the Popular Bloc emerged as the strongest force.
</p>
<p class="fst">
The C.P.-S.P.
Bloc secured 775,915 votes<br />
Christian Democrats 379,588<br />
Uomo Qualunque 231,168<br />
Liberals 122,551<br />
Monarchists 97,041<br />
Republicans 58,639<br />
Other Parties 21,889
</p>
<p>
The Popular
Bloc improved their positions in all the cities in comparison with the former
general election. Even in Sicily, one of the most politically stagnant areas of
the South, the Popular Bloc headed the poll with 590,870 in comparison with the
Christian Democrats 399,125. In the previous elections the extreme reactionary
parties had three times the number of votes as the parties of the Popular Bloc.
</p>
<h4>Tendency reversed</h4>
<p class="fst">
But this
tendency was sharply reversed in the present general election. In nearly all
the cities, even of the industrial North, the Christian Democrat poll topped
that of the Popular Bloc. In the 1946 general election the C.P., S.P. and the
Action Party received 9,421,229 votes together amounting to 41.1% of the votes,
the Christian Democrats 8,083,208 votes or 35.2% and other Right Wing parties
the balance. Now the Popular Front received 8,025,990 or 30.7% together with
the Socialist Unity Party who split from the Nenni Socialist Party and received
1,860,528 or 7% of the votes, a total of 9,886,518 votes. This is 465,000 more
than the last election but only 27.7% of the total vote or 3.4% less than
formerly. The Christian Democrats gathering round themselves the bulk of the
reaction and polled 12,751,841 votes or 48.7% of the total this time. This
represented an increase of nearly 4,750,000 votes! Most of the Right Wing
parties did badly but the split-away fascist grouping from the Uomo Qualunque,
putting up candidates for the first time received 525,408 votes. Thus three
years after the war and despite the experience of 20 years of fascism they can
now come forward and dare to flaunt their doctrines in the face of the working
class.
</p>
<h4>Present
situation</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
Stalinists apparently intend to accept the swing of Italy over to the
Anglo-American bloc for the time being. In the meantime some of the Nenni
Socialists led by the former Socialist Minister of the Interior apparently
intend to split towards the Right Wing Saragat Grouping which is to become part
of the coalition Government with the Christian Democrats. The Stalinist Di
Vittorio, secretary-general of the Italian T.U.C. [the C.G.I.L.], which is
dominated by the Communist Party, declared on the Marshall Plan (according to
the <em>Daily Herald</em> of 22<sup>nd</sup> April and not denied by the C.P.),
&#8220;When someone wants to help you, it is ridiculous to slap him in the face.&#8221;
</p>
<h4>No lasting solution</h4>
<p class="fst">
The American
Imperialists are preparing to rush supplies to Italy. The Allies are already
discussing bringing Italy into the Western Bloc, i.e., the joint conspiracy
against the Socialist revolution in Europe and for ultimate war against the
Soviet Union.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, De
Gasperi is selecting and training a police force from which &#8220;subversive forces&#8221;
have been weeded out and which the Italian capitalists consider will be
entirely reliable for use against the workers. With the lack of a revolutionary
alternative the capitalists, especially with Marshall aid may succeed in
temporarily stabilising the situation. But such a situation cannot endure for
many years. The Christian Democrats, like all the middle-of-the-way capitalist
exploiters of the middle class are doomed to break up. The urban middle class
and the peasants will swing away to Right and to Left. As the correspondent of
the <em>Daily Mail</em> remarks with foreboding, a permanent solution has not at
all been attained. The temporary stampede of the middle class and backward
peasants and workers can rapidly change on the basis of the crisis of
capitalism in Italy. This crisis cannot be fundamentally eliminated even with
Marshall aid. A new polarisation of the classes is inevitable. In the coming
days the membership of the C.P. too, will begin to ask why the C.P. fails to
give a revolutionary lead.
</p>
<p>
The
alternative will inexorably be posed: either the conquest of power by the
workers led by a genuine revolutionary Communist Party or the crushing of the
workers and their organisations in a new fascist dictatorship.
