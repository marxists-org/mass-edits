<p class="fst">The sensational expulsion of the Yugoslavian Communist Party from
the Cominform<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup> and the open breach between
Moscow and Belgrade has aroused a lively discussion in the ranks of
the working class. What lies behind these sensational events? That is
the question everyone is asking. Only political children accept the
statement issued by the Cominform as to the basis of the dispute.
</p>


<P>Whatever it is, however, it must be of tremendous importance for
the Stalinists to precipitate the open breach which amounts to a
considerable diplomatic and political set-back.</p>


<P>The conflict will undoubtedly have wide repercussions in the
Communist Parties on an international scale. It marks a new stage in
the development of international Stalinism which must be closely
followed by revolutionary and militant workers.</p>


<P>The struggle must have been going on behind the scenes for a
considerable time. Moscow would only have brought the question out
into the open when it had failed to gain control of the Yugoslav
Communist Party, when the Russian secret police, the MVD, in
Yugoslavia had suffered a decisive defeat; when it was considered no
longer possible to win Tito or his supporters; and probably, when
Tito was gaining support for his policy against Moscow in the other
Balkan Communist Parties. This latter event would be the most potent
factor in arousing the hatred and fear of Moscow.</p>


<P>The real issues of the dispute come out only covertly. What
appears to be at stake is the demand by the Russian bureaucracy in
Moscow for complete and absolute control over the satellite states,
even to the smallest detail of internal policy, and Tito's hostility
and opposition to complete subjugation to Russia.</p>


<P>Moscow is faced with two possibilities in the evolution of its
policy towards the satellite states in the coming period.</p>


<P>The first is to incorporate these states openly into the USSR as a
means of ensuring complete and undisputed control; the second is to
accept the nominal independence of these states but to try so to
organise their internal regimes and arrange their relations with each
other as to ensure that the real control is centred in Moscow.</p>


<P>The first policy has considerable disadvantages in that it would
violate the national aspirations of the people of the border states
and meet with widespread opposition not only from the broad mass of
the people, but even from the ranks of the Communist Parties
themselves. It could only be carried out after long preparation and
the assurance of one hundred per cent state domination centrally and
in the localities by the Russian Stalinists. To carry it out with any
measure of force would arouse the hostility of the whole of the
European working class.</p>


<h4>Stalin's Great Russian Chauvinism</h4>

<P>The second policy would not ensure such complete subjugation and
control of the border states but it has certain advantages in that
the real control would rest in Moscow while thc nominal independence
of these countries could be used to diplomatic and economic
advantage. It would still be possible to prevent the federation of
the border states strengthen their relative independence in relation
to Moscow.</p>


<P>The whole history of Stalinism - of great Russian chauvinism - and
especially the most recent conflicts of policy, indicate that Stalin
will fight with every possible weapon to prevent the creation of
independent groups of states within the Eastern European countries.
</p>


<P>A key to the conflict is given in the repeated demand from Tito
for the Federation of Bulgaria, Albania and Yugoslavia and his
reported ambitions for a federation of the Balkan countries. The
importance of this policy as an issue in dispute is seen in the fact
that the Yugoslavian Communist Party has restated its Balkans
federation policy immediately following on the heels of its
expulsion. It must be remembered that
Dimitrov<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup> was recently hauled over the coals
by Moscow for advocating a federation. In a federation of the three
countries, Yugoslavia would obviously play the dominant role.</p>


<P>Such a federation at the present time would undoubtedly result in
a strengthening of the Communist Parties of these countries and their
states as against the domination of Moscow. It is, therefore, one
policy which Moscow will fight with every weapon it can muster until
and unless, it is assured of absolute control through puppets.</p>


<P>In the statement of the Cominform, as quoted in the <em>Daily
Worker </em>of June 30th, they say:

<p class="quote">&quot;The leadership of the Yugoslav
Communist Party is carrying out a policy unfriendly toward the Soviet
Union and to the All-Union Communist Party. In Yugoslavia an unworthy
policy of belittling Soviet military experts and discrediting the
Soviet Army has been permitted. Soviet civilian specialists in
Yugoslavia have been subjected to a special regime, on the basis of
which they were put under the surveillance of State security organs
and subjected to shadowing. The representative of the All-Union
Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the Information Bureau, Comrade
Yudin, and a number of official representatives of the Soviet Union
in Yugoslavia, were subjected to the same shadowing and supervision
on the part of the State security organs of Yugoslavia.</p>


<P class="quote">&quot;All these and similar facts prove that the leaders of the
Yugoslav Communist Party have taken up an attitude unworthy of
Communists, on the basis of which the Yugoslav leaders began to
identify the foreign policy of the USSR with the foreign policy of
the imperialist powers and behaved towards the Soviet Union in the
same manner as toward the bourgeois states. Precisely as a
consequence of that anti-Soviet attitude, slanderous propaganda -
borrowed from the arsenal of counter-revolutionary Trotskyism - on
the degeneration of the All-Union Communist Party, on the
degeneration of the Soviet Union and so on has become current in the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.&quot;</p>


<P class="fst">The same issue of the <em>Dally Worker </em>quotes the reply of Tito
and Co to the accusation that Russian &quot;specialists&quot; were shadowed, as
follows: &quot;This is a definite lie&#133;it is a definite lie that
anybody was followed. From the liberation until today all members of
the Party have given full co-operation to Soviet citizens.&quot;</p>


<P>The <em>Daily Worker </em>did not finish the quotation and in this
it both deliberately misinformed its readers, and indicated that its
editors were not prepared to state the case for the Yugoslavs fairly
and objectively. Already they had taken sides in the dispute as mere
Russian hacks. The Yugoslavian Communist Party statement went on to
declare that: &quot;On the contrary, it is absolutely true, as pointed out
in our letter of April 13th, that from the time of the liberation
until today members of the Soviet intelligence service attempted
without consideration to recruit Yugoslavs.&quot; Let the editors of the
<em>Daily Worker </em>explain to its readers the omission of this
fundamental part of its brother Party's reply.</p>


<P>The facts are that the Stalinist military and &quot;civil&quot; specialists
in Yugoslavia, as in all other satellite countries have, or seek, what
amounts to extra-territorial rights. The apparatus of the MVD is
built to ensure the carrying out of Russian policies and the
elimination of anti-Stalinist elements. But it seems that Tito was
not prepared to give Stalin freedom to build an independent military
and police apparatus which could be used against himself and the
other members of the Yugoslav Communist Party who supported the
orientation of achieving a large measure of independence from Moscow.
</p>


<P>The <em>Daily Worker </em>was guilty of a further distortion. In
printing Tito's protest against accusations that there had been no
elections in the Yugoslav CP, they had refused to print the reply
that Stalin's Party was no better. &quot;As for the fact that in a few
sections there have been no elections, this was caused only by
war-time conditions. It has been the case in many parties including
the Russian Bolshevik Party.&quot;</p>


<P>That the Stalinist secret police have been defeated is indicated
by the complaints in the Cominform statement both as regards the
supervision of Russian &quot;specialists&quot; and by the demands for democracy
in the Yugoslav CP.</p>


<P>The Yugoslav pupils seem to have learned too well from the Russian
master. They got in first and expelled Stalin's stooges from the
Party. It cannot be excluded that the recent execution of leading
members of the Yugoslav Communist Party as &quot;British agents&quot; was
another example of the Stalinist method of eliminating political
opponents. A little Balkan version of the Moscow Trials.</p>


<P>The Cominform declaration that the &quot;Yugoslav leaders began to
identify the foreign policy of the USSR with the foreign policy of
the imperialist powers&#133;&quot; is clear evidence that the Yugoslavs
were objecting to the demands of the Russians, which they considered
to be in violation of the interests and national aspirations of the
Yugoslavs.</p>


<h4>Lenin Opposed Stalin On National Question</h4>

<P>The tendency of Stalin to Great Russian chauvinism is nothing new.
He has been built up as the great &quot;Leninist authority&quot; on the
National Question. In fact, one of the last struggles which Lenin
conducted against Stalin before he died was precisely to oppose
Stalin's bureaucratic policy towards national minorities. But this,
like Lenin's last letter to the Bolshevik Party demanding the removal
of Stalin from the position of General Secretary of the Party, has
been hidden from the rank and file communists until this present day.
This tendency against which Lenin fought, became more pronounced
after his death when Stalin succeeded in usurping complete control.
During the great purges, the entire Governments of National Republics
were wiped out, massacred, as part of Stalin's policy of national
oppression. Tito appears to have learnt some lessons from the purges.
</p>


<P>If the leaders of the Yugoslavian Party have indeed criticised
Moscow as the Cominform statement alleges, with arguments &quot;borrowed
from the arsenal of counter-revolutionary Trotskyism - on the
degeneration of the All-Union Communist Party, on the degeneration of
the Soviet Union and so on&#133;&quot;, we can only hope that some spark
of light has penetrated the ranks of the Yugoslav Communist Party.
One thing we know. Tito is no Trotskyist. Organisationally and
ideologically he is the enemy of Trotskyism. At the period of the
liberation of Yugoslavia, Tito was responsible for the physical
annihilation of the &quot;Trotskyists&quot;.</p>


<P>If the pressure fails to take effect and Tito refuses to
capitulate, Stalin may be compelled to come to some agreement.</p>


<P>Even now, far from attacking the real crimes of the Stalinist
bureaucracy, it appears that Tito will try to arrive at some
compromise. Experience teaches that Stalin will stop at nothing to
wipe out the opposition of the character with which he is now faced
in Yugoslavia. The whole monstrous apparatus of Russian propaganda
will be turned against the leaders of the Yugoslav regime. The
miserable Stalinist hacks in this country, who only yesterday were
blazoning Yugoslavia, Tito and his achievements in their press, will
now turn their pens against the regime to undermine it and denigrate
its leaders.</p>


<P>For the first time, and only in order to discredit the dissident
Tito and his regime, the Stalinists now blurt out some truths.
Criticisms that Trotskyists have made of the regime in Yugoslavia,
are now revealed as true by the Stalinists themselves. The Cominform
statement says:</p>


<P class="quote">&quot;Inside Yugoslavia the Party does not have any internal party
democracy, elections are not held, there is no criticism or self
criticism. The Central Committee of the Party&#133;consists in its
majority not of elected but co-opted members&#133;It is quite
intolerable that in the Yugoslav Communist Party the most elementary
rights of party members are being trampled upon, that the slightest
criticism of the incorrect way in which things are run in the Party
is followed by grave repressions. The Information Bureau regards as
disgraceful such facts as the expulsion from the Party and arrest of
members of the Central Committee Comrades Zujovic and Hebrang,
because they dared to criticise the anti-Soviet attitude of leaders
of the Yugoslav Communist Party and to advocate friendship between
Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Such an ignominious, purely Turkish
[!!] terrorist regime cannot be tolerated by the Yugoslav Communist
Party&#133;the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist Party, are infected
by excessive ambition, haughtiness and conceit.&quot;</p>


<P class="fst">If ever there was a case of a pot calling the kettle black, here
it is! Tongue in cheek, the Moscow bureaucracy attacks Tito for the
lack of democracy. This bureaucracy which murdered practically all
the leaders of the October Revolution, which killed and exiled
millions to Siberia for opposition to their regime, which is so
contemptuous of the rights of the rank and file, that in violation of
the Constitution, they have not bothered to hold a Party Conference
in Russia for nearly ten years. The last Congress of the Russian
Communist Party was held in October 1938. In Lenin's time the
Congress was held at least once a year, even during the Civil War.
</p>


<P>Any who dare offer a criticism of Stalin are soon on the road to
Siberia or destined to die at the hands of a hired assassin. Tito's
regime is probably a model of democracy compared to the Russian
regime which is the most totalitarian and bureaucratic in the whole
of history.</p>


<P>Some of the economic criticisms are undoubtedly correct. They
repeat in a distorted way, the criticism which Trotsky made of
Stalin's policy from 1923 to 1927. First that Tito underestimated the
Kulak elements in the villages, and the danger which arises from
this, then, after criticism, reversed his policy and proceeded to
nationalise small shops and other small industries and to take action
in the villages before the economic basis had been prepared.
Precisely the way Stalin proceeded! From opposing collectivisation to
&quot;liquidating the Kulaks as a class&quot; and introducing 100%
collectivisation. The bureaucrats in Moscow and in the Cominform must
have necks of brass to make the criticism that there is no
nationalisation of the land in Yugoslavia. This is a correct
criticism. But it happens that they have not nationalised the land in
a single one of the satellite states either.</p>


<P>The question immediately springs to mind: why were the facts now
enumerated by the Cominform concealed for years? Why is it revealed
only when Tito refuses to bow the knee to Stalin and uses Stalin's
tricks against him? In place of Stalin's MVD, Tito has an efficient
instrument of his own and is arresting Stalin's stooges, apparently
on charges of being in the pay of British and American imperialism!
It may even be true that in the circles of the Yugoslav CP, Marshall
Tito while he does not dare bring this into the open, has been
secretly denouncing the degeneration of the Russian Communist Party
and regime.</p>


<P>In the past Moscow succeeded in asserting its will, and removing
or destroying the leadership of national sections without a serious
crisis. The history of the Comintern is saturated with the
bureaucratic elimination of Stalin's opponents and agents who have
been sacrificed in the interests of the bureaucracy.</p>


<P>In Russia, every member of the Central Committee of the Russian
Communist Party who was in the leadership of the revolution from 1917
to 1921 - every member other than those who died at the hands of the
capitalist counter-revolution or by natural means - has been shot or
otherwise driven to death. Madame Kollontai and Stalin are the sole
survivors of the 24 members.</p>


<P>The Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party and Young
Communist League were massacred to a man when living in Russia
because of illegal conditions, not once but twice during the late
1930s.</p>


<P>These purges took place without great disturbance. But once the
national parties have control of their own state apparatus, all the
levers of finance, economy, the military and the police, the
inevitable effect of such a transformation is to strengthen the
position of the national leadership and to create conditions of
independence from Moscow.</p>


<P>The importance of the present conflict lies in the fact that it is
the first important crack in the international front of Stalinism
since the end of the war. It is bound to have profound effects on the
rank and file members of the Communist Parties throughout the world,
especially in Western Europe and Britain. It is the beginning of a
process of differentiation within the Communist Parties, which in the
long run will lead to splits.</p>


<P>The extension of the power of the Russian bureaucracy further west
from the Russian borders creates new problems for them. While
temporarily strengthening them, in the long run it will undermine
their position.</p>


<P>It is clear that any Leninist must support the right of any small
country to national liberation and freedom if it so desires. All
socialists will give critical support to the movement in Yugoslavia
to federate with Bulgaria and to gain freedom from direct Moscow
domination. At the same time the workers in Yugoslavia and these
countries will fight for the installation of genuine workers'
democracy, of the control of the administration of the state and of
industry as in days of Lenin and Trotsky in Russia. This is
impossible under the present Tito regime.</p>


<P><em>For an Independent Socialist Soviet Yugoslavia within an
Independent Socialist Soviet Balkans. This can only be part of the
struggle for the overthrow of the Capitalist Governments in Europe
and the installation of Workers' Democracy in Russia.</em></p>


<P>Communism means the widest possible freedom and democracy for the
people. Without the participation and control of the workers there
can be no transition to socialism. These developments in the Balkans
are a symptom of the real situation which exists in Russia and the
Eastern States. The sole solution lies in a genuinely democratic
Soviet regime with full autonomy and freedom for the national states
within the boundaries of a socialist federation of states.</p>

<P><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-1" name="foot-1">(1)</a></sup> The Cominform - The Communist Information
Bureau was established following the March 1947 &quot;Truman Doctrine&quot;
whereby US President Truman launched an &quot;ideological and economic
crusade against communism&quot;. This included the Marshall Plan of
economic aid for Europe which had as one aim to assist the recovery
of capitalism in Eastern Europe. The Cominform was founded in Warsaw
in September 1947 primarily to consolidate the domination of the
Russian bureaucracy over their &quot;fraternal&quot; allies in Eastern Europe.
