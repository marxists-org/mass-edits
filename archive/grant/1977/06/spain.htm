<p class="fst">
The Spanish Revolution is still in its early stages. The
Spanish and world capitalist class must count themselves as
exceedingly fortunate in making the transition from a totalitarian
police system in an advanced stage of putrefaction and dissolution to
a sham monarchist-capitalist &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
From the illusions of totalitarian control&mdash;when the reality has
collapsed&mdash;the capitalists, in order to maintain their power, have
moved to a form of parliamentary rule. The capitalist class is very
flexible in the form of its control of society&mdash;so long as its
ownership of property and the means of production, which means its
domination over society and the source of exploitation and wealth, is
guaranteed.
</p>
<h4>Rigged</h4>
<p class="fst">
They
have set the framework of a rigid bonapartist constitution with the
monarchy having a veto and the right to nominate 41 out of 248
senators. They have given the rural areas in both the senate and the
assembly a disproportionate share of the seats.
Many times more votes are necessary for the election to the assembly
or senate from the highly populated towns and areas than from the
rural provinces.
</p>
<p>
This
bias in the rigged constitution is intended to maintain firm control
in the hands of the King and the &ldquo;new&rdquo; regime. <i>The
regime has maintained intact all the forces of repression: the army,
the civil guard, the police, the top civil servants, i.e. the state
machine, including the most odious torturers.</i>
</p>
<p>
Voting for the congress is by lists and proportional
representation for the individual constituency. But for the senate it
is by simple majority vote. The senate, apart from the king&rsquo;s
nominations, will be rigged even more heavily in favour of the rural,
more conservative inclined voters, who are also more under control
and fear the local landlords, local bosses, the police and state
authorities. Many will vote in the way they are instructed by these
gangsters.
</p>
<p>
No wonder the <i>Financial Times</i>, journal of
the British Stock Exchange, comments ironically: &ldquo;inevitably the
rules have been affected by the entrenched members of the Franco
regime seeking to ensure a superficial, controlled democracy weighed
against the vociferous demands of the left.&rdquo; (June 9, 1977)
</p>
<p>
The regime, in its provisions, has many of the aspects of the Primo de
Rivera dictatorship of the 1920s. But because of the situation it is
a more &ldquo;democratic&rdquo;-looking form of rule, balancing between the
different classes. The rights of the trade unions and of the main
political parties of the working class, the Socialist Party (PSOE)
and Communist Party have been formally restored especially during the
election period. But the rights of meetings, to demonstrate, etc.,
are still subject to the whim of the superintendent of police. The
banning of meetings and of demonstrations have been almost a daily
occurrence before the elections.
</p>
<p>
It is only the policy of the leaders of the CP and the
PSOE which have allowed Suarez, the Prime Minister, to pose and strut
as a new found &ldquo;Democrat&rdquo;. With a Marxist policy on the part of
the leaders of these organisations the whole pretence could have been
swept away by the working class. In reality the rights obtained by
the workers&rsquo; organisations, to strike, to demonstrate and free
speech have been won by the heroic battles and struggles of the last
ten years. Nothing has been given that has not been conceded and won
by the sacrifices, struggles and blood of countless Spanish workers
during the past period.
</p>
<p>
The ruling class understood that if they did not introduce niggardly
reform from the top it would mean revolution from the bottom. The
experience of Portugal is haunting the Spanish capitalists. In the
elections Suarez is being pictured as the man who benevolently and
graciously gave democracy to Spain. The CP leaders have gone out of
their way to declare the Franco flag the national flag of Spain, to
accept the monarchy, and to picture Suarez as a democrat.
</p>
<p>
In an interview in the <i>Morning Star</i> (June 9, 1977)
Federico Melchor, editor of <i>Mundo Obrero</i>, the
Communist Party paper, declared
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;take for example the question of the national flag. It must not be
forgotten that Franco fought the civil war under that flag, against
the legally elected government of the republic which had a different
flag. But when at our meetings we tell people, most of whom are
republicans, that the state flag is also our flag and should not be
allowed to become the possession of the ultra-right [!?!], they
applaud our actions.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;People also show their approval when we declare that while Premier
Adolfo Suarez is our political adversary, but not our enemy, the
enemy is the ultra-right&hellip;then there is the question of fear. There
is a real fear among the people, and it is in the first place the
fear of those fascist elements who did well out of 40 years of Franco
dictatorship and of what they might do in defeat.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;In small towns people are very conscious of the fact that the
local civil guard, sergeants and officers are the same who were
beating people up not so long ago, while the Mayors, the local police
chiefs and most of the army commanders are also the same.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;&hellip;they [people] also know that Suarez legalised the CP, the trade
unions, liquidated Franco&rsquo;s fascist movement, the only legal
political party, gave access on radio and television to the
opposition parties and insisted that on television the CP should be
treated like other parties&hellip;
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;&hellip;And we think so, too, that Suarez is making this contribution
despite his own fascist past. But who has not got a fascist past in
the ruling circles of this country? The important thing is what
people are doing now.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
This
disgusting crawling on all fours in front of Suarez and the ruling
class marks a peak in the degeneration of the CP. Imagine Lenin or
Trotsky or even any of the <i>Mensheviks</i>
behaving in this way before the revolution of 1917! It is as if
Suarez and the ruling class had suddenly had a religious conversion
and seen the light of &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;. The rigged constitution&mdash;passed
by Franco&rsquo;s Cortes&mdash;provides an annihilating comment on the CP
which has completely lost the rudder of Marxist theory and Marxist
perspectives.
</p>
<p>
It trails behind the ruling class and imagines that the
former fascists and their masters the capitalists have had a &ldquo;change
of heart&rdquo;. This snivelling crew has no confidence in the power
developed by the Spanish working class, with precarious or almost
non-existent organisation, in their strikes and demonstrations.
</p>
<p>
Having learnt nothing from the history of the Civil War
and the disastrous policy of class collaboration with the
&ldquo;democratic&rdquo;, &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; capitalists and their representatives
and spokesmen, which led to defeat in the 1930s, the leaders of the
CP have adopted an even worse policy.
</p>
<p>
If there is not a Popular Front in the election it is
because the capitalist Liberal parties and the Socialist Party&mdash;for
the moment&mdash;have rejected it despite the plans of the CP leaders.
They will adopt this &ldquo;strike-breaking policy&rdquo; when the movement
of the workers becomes impossible to contain in any other way.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the policy of the Communist Party leaders is
far to the right of that of Felipe Gonzalez, leader of the Socialist
Party. Despite weaker organisation the Socialist Party is gaining
heavily, among other reasons because of the more left, more
&ldquo;socialist&rdquo; policy Felipe and the other leaders of the party are
putting forward. They may gain 25-35 percent of the votes in the
election.
</p>
<h4>General Strike</h4>
<p class="fst">
The workers&rsquo; parties together may come close to
gaining between 35 percent and 50 percent of the votes. In comparison
with the first free election in Portugal where they gained more than
two thirds, that seems small. But in Portugal that was after the
overthrow of the dictatorship which unleashed an enormous movement in
the working class. Mass action strengthens the organisations of the
proletariat. Thus in Portugal with only one third of the population
working class in composition, they drew behind them all the viable
sections of the peasantry and middle class.
</p>
<p>
A
dynamic policy of the workers <i>in
action</i> has
consequences on the electoral field also. But
the electoral statistics are only a barometer of support and
relations between the classes at one particular moment in time. Even
if Suarez and the ruling class succeed by a rigged system in gaining
a majority they will not be able to maintain this for any length of
time.
</p>
<p>
The whole artificial structure will either be &ldquo;reformed&rdquo;
or collapse under the blows of the workers. The light-mindedness of
the regime in thinking that they can preserve intact the whole
framework of the old system and keep control in their hands is
demonstrated by events in the Basque Country during the course of the
election campaign itself. The demand for amnesty for all political
prisoners resulted in a mass demonstration of workers which was fired
on by Civil Guards, killing a few.
</p>
<p>
The reply of the workers was a 24 hour General Strike in the Basque
country involving 500,000 workers. This was joined by the shopkeepers
and small business people, professional people and practically every
section of the working population. The government which had been
adamant was forced to concede to this mass movement and all or
practically all Basque prisoners have been released.
</p>
<p>
<i>Had it not been for the sabotage and strike-breaking of the Communist
Party and the leaders of the Workers&rsquo; Commissions the General
Strike would have been of an all-Spain character and profoundly
affected and quickened the tempo of events.</i>
</p>
<p>
But the strike in itself is a demonstration of the
utopian dream of the old regime of a &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; democratic
bonapartism. Spain more than any other country will reveal
lightning-like changes and complete turns in the situation in the
coming period.
</p>
<p>
With the world economic background and the sickness of
Spanish capitalism, the disease of all the sick men of Europe (Italy,
Britain and France) infects also the Iberian Peninsula. With over 30
percent inflation, falling investment, a massive flight of capital
abroad and over a million unemployed in a population of 35 million
the way is being prepared for future social explosions. The
frustrations of military and police repressions, the nightmares and
insecurity of the last 40 years cannot be exorcised by lifting the
lid in order to create a makeshift safety valve.
</p>
<p>
The concession of municipal elections after the brief
dictatorship of Primo de Rivera in the 1920s, despite his leaning on
the rural &ldquo;Royalist&rdquo; votes in the countryside could not prevent
the immediate collapse of the monarchy in 1931 and give an impetus to
the developing revolution.
</p>
<p>
With the temperament and tradition of the Spanish
workers, with 35 to 50 percent of the votes for the left parties, in
spite of the role of their leaders, feeling cheated in a rigged poll,
it is not excluded that there could be a massive movement of strikes
and demonstrations bringing down a Suarez dominated government almost
immediately.
</p>
<p>
In the election campaign there have been very large
meetings&mdash;rousing demonstrations&mdash;of tens and hundreds of thousands
by the workers&rsquo; parties. This marks the first movements by some
sections of the workers and middle class who have been previously
inert. Events and even accidental conflicts will bring more and more
layers of the workers into movement in strikes, sit-ins,
demonstrations and other actions.
</p>
<h4>CIA</h4>
<p class="fst">
The ruling clique sought to tame and harness the revolution in a
&ldquo;controlled&rdquo; i.e. sham &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;. They have miscalculated
completely despite the leaders of the Communist Party and the
Socialist Party. In the same way the CIA and the leaders of German
and Swedish Social Democracy hope to have a &ldquo;controlled&rdquo;
Socialist Party in the PSOE.
</p>
<p>
<i>Militant </i>predicted that the
PSOE would become the principal mass tendency of the working class
and the UGT (the Socialist Party trade union) possibly the most
powerful trade union force. That prediction is being realised, the
PSOE will become the principal medium for the revolutionary workers.
</p>
<p>
Despite this or that lull or bafflement of the workers,
despite the illusions in capitalist democracy, like the illusions in
the 1920s and 1930s of the workers in the Republic, and partly
because of these illusions, sharp movements of indignation and sudden
explosions of anger are inevitable. The young workers in the PSOE and
the Spanish Young Socialists, in a whole series of waves, can be won
over to the ideas of Marxism. The PSOE can be transformed in this
process. Over a period of months and even years there will be a
series of crises of policy within the working class and the party.
Events, events, events will drive the working class in Spain towards
the policies of social revolution.
