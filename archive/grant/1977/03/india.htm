Mrs
Gandhi&rsquo;s gamble has failed. The Janata &ldquo;party&rdquo; (in reality, a
coalition) has won the election.
With 536 of the 542 results officially announced the parties&rsquo;
positions were (with present seats in brackets):

<p>
The
reason for Mrs Gandhi&rsquo;s defeat was the brutal &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; which
she instituted. Tens of thousands of opponents were imprisoned
without trial. Fernandes, the railwaymen&rsquo;s leader, and other trade
unionists, were jailed. Millions were coerced, some forcibly, into
&ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; sterilisation to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; India&rsquo;s
&ldquo;over-population&rdquo;. There was a censorship of the press and a
shackling of the unions.
</p>
<p>
Mrs
Gandhi raised the state above parliament, though based on the
obedient votes of the Congress deputies. She ruled by decree. Her
regime was one that Marxists call bonapartist. She balanced between
the classes, leaning on the mass organisations of the Congress,
especially the youth Congress under the control of her son Sanjay.
But at the same time, Mrs Gandhi used the police as a terror weapon
against the workers, peasants and any opposition within the middle
class.
</p>
<p>
Blind
to the effects of her measures, and boasting like Mussolini that the
trains now ran on time, she called elections confident that she would
obtain again a big majority.
</p>
<p>
India
is a country of stark poverty. Hundreds of millions live in
semi-starvation in the villages. Tens of millions are homeless. Tens
of millions live in hovels. Hundreds of thousands live on the
pavements in Calcutta. While the masses starve, a comparative handful
live lives of opulent splendour. Millionaires flaunt their wealth.
Extremes of poverty contrast with extremes of wealth. The landlords
and industrialists, the black market merchants and racketeers, live
off the backs of the population.
</p>
<p>
Industrial
workers live in hovels, under conditions of extreme poverty. It is
these conditions, and the effect of the revolutions in China and
Russia, which force Mrs Gandhi and her opponents to pretend to stand
for some form of &ldquo;socialism&rdquo;. This indicates that not only the
workers, but the peasants too understand that the elimination of
their misery is linked with the abolition of landlordism and
capitalism.
</p>
<p>
The
opposition which has defeated Mrs Gandhi is even more reactionary.
The sole purpose of the &ldquo;Janata&rdquo; &ldquo;Party&rdquo; was to oust Mrs
Gandhi. It is a combination of the extreme right-wing Jan Sangh
(Hindu communalists and virtual fascists) with Morarji Desai&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Congress Democrats&rdquo; (a big business right-wing split-off from
Mrs Gandhi&rsquo;s National Congress), pacifists [and] &ldquo;socialists&rdquo;
like Jai Prakash, Narain and other reformist socialists.
</p>
<p>
In
British terms it would be like a combination of Thatcherite Tories,
Powellites, Liberals and Labour in a single &ldquo;Party&rdquo;. The views of
Jan Sangh, however, are far to the right of Powell. They have incited
and organised many anti-Muslim riots and pogroms. This coalition will
start disintegrating the moment they try to advance any programme.
</p>
<p>
In
a society beset by problems of hunger and lack of the barest
civilised amenities it was inevitable that the workers would move
towards what they thought was Marxism. The Communist Party of India
gained mass support. But like their brother parties in the West,
turned towards an even more pernicious form of reformism. They have
clung to the coat-tails of Mrs Gandhi and the capitalist-landlord
Congress Party.
</p>
<h4>Collaboration</h4>
<p class="fst">
Marx
and Lenin made the point that the further East one travels, the more
rotten, degenerate and repulsive became the capitalist class. Yet
instead of the policy of Lenin&mdash;implacable opposition to the liberal
capitalists in the struggle against Czarism&mdash;the CPI, despite Mrs
Gandhi&rsquo;s policies, supported the &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; measures. Instead
of a struggle against the rotten Congress they collaborated with
them!
</p>
<p>
Instead
of Lenin&rsquo;s policy of teaching the workers to rely only on their own
independent strength, forces and organisation, drawing behind them in
struggle the peasants and middle class, they preached support for the
&ldquo;emergency&rdquo; and thus all its repressive measures, including the
arrest and imprisonment of many rank-and-file and lower-rank leaders
of the Communist Party.
</p>
<p>
Despite
this, Sanjay Gandhi and Mrs Gandhi herself did not fail to remind the
CP leaders of the CP&rsquo;s support of British imperialism in the war,
while the Congress leaders were imprisoned.
</p>
<p>
The
alliance, however, has led to the electoral rout, not only of Mrs
Gandhi&rsquo;s Congress, but of the CP as well! They have gained nothing
but discredit from this shameful alliance. The <i>Morning
Star </i>(21<sup>st</sup>
March) discreetly reports the fiasco without comment. But before they
enthusiastically endorsed the position of the Indian CP!
</p>
<p>
The
CPI (M) (Communist Party of India Marxist) split from the CPI under
the influence of Maoism, denouncing the latter&rsquo;s reformism, but
without Marxist perspectives or policies. Failing to analyse the
mistakes of Stalin and Mao, they too inevitably succumbed to
reformism.
</p>
<p>
They
began by rejecting Mrs Gandhi&rsquo;s &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; measures, but
without organising a struggle against them. They never adopted an
independent class position, looking for support from the masses.
Rejecting Mrs Gandhi, they then embraced the Janata Party&mdash;i.e. were
prepared to come to an agreement with a hodge-podge including the Jan
Sangh communalists! They thus adopted an even worse position than the
CPI!
</p>
<p>
Lip
service to democracy by the Janata Party will soon be abandoned and
the coalition will fall to pieces. But the most vicious reactionaries
will have gained the most.
</p>
<p>
In
the resulting chaos and conflicts, nationalities in the South and
North will struggle against national oppression. The Hindu Jan Sangh
will unleash their thugs against the Muslim minority.
</p>
<p>
The
workers will fight for better conditions and a bigger share of the
wealth they produce. The peasants and lower middle class will look at
least for an alleviation of their misery.
</p>
<p>
The
showpiece of capitalist &ldquo;Democracy&rdquo; in the colonial, or former
colonial, world was India. The emergency of Mrs Gandhi tarnished this
picture. Now the world economic crisis places enormous burdens on the
weaker &ldquo;underdeveloped&rdquo; world. If Mrs Gandhi had won, the
position would not be fundamentally different. On a capitalist basis
the problems of India are now insoluble.
</p>
<p>
With
the new influence of the Jan Sangh reactionaries on the government,
their vile communal thugs will consider the results a licence to
attack the Muslims, the Communist Party which supported Mrs Gandhi,
their &ldquo;allies&rdquo; of the CPI (M), and any trade unionists or workers
and peasants who take action in defence of their interests. Without a
bold lead from the mass parties, there is the danger and the
possibility of the army taking control and establishing a
military-police dictatorship, or possibly the break-up of India, or
both.
</p>
<p>
One
country after another in Asia, Africa and Latin America, because of
the poverty of the masses, and the super-exploitation by Western
imperialism, has taken the road to military-police dictatorship and
savage repression of the workers and peasants. Now it is the turn of
India.
</p>
<p>
The
CPI supported Mrs Gandhi&rsquo;s regime, which was well on the way to
this &ldquo;solution&rdquo;. In their folly, the CPI had the enthusiastic
support of the leaders of the British Communist Party and other
&ldquo;national&rdquo; Communist Parties, including that of the Soviet Union.
</p>
<p>
The
CPI (M), yesterday&rsquo;s self-styled revolutionaries, have recoiled
from Mrs Gandhi into the arms of Mararji Desai, the representative of
the big business right-wing of Congress, and the communalist Jan
Sangh.
</p>
<p>
Neither
of these self-styled Marxist parties stands on the class independence
of the working class, and thus in reality are to the right of the
British Labour Party.
</p>
<p>
The
two Communist parties of India had a greater base in numbers and
support than the Bolsheviks in the early days of the Russian
revolution. But if it depends on the leaders of these parties, their
members will be led to the slavery of a complete capitalist
dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
Yet
from the ranks of the Communist Party&rsquo;s membership of militant
workers, once they adopt the ideas of Marxism, can come the forces to
transform India. Avoiding the nightmare of Stalinist Russia and
Maoist China, they could establish a workers&rsquo; democracy, looking to
the fraternal support of the workers of the West and of the world.
That is the alternative for India: open capitalist dictatorship&mdash;or
workers&rsquo; democracy rallying the people of India behind the
programme of socialist transformation.
