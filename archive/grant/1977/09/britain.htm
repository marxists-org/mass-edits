<p class="fst">Within the web of the general crisis of world
capitalism exists the special crisis of British capitalism. In
reality, for the whole of the twentieth century there has been a
decline in the power and position of British capitalism. This has
been disguised because of the difficulties, upheavals and
revolutionary crises which have faced her rivals, especially
between the two world wars.</p>


<p>But even more important has been the relative
social stability given to British capitalism by the policies of
the leaders of the mass organisations of the working class - the
Labour Party and trade unions - in periods of both Tory and
Labour governments. In the period since the second world war,
there has been a collapse of British power, unprecedented in
scope and depth. The only thing that has cushioned the frightful
social consequences of this steep decline has been the growth of
world trade and of the world market during the world economic
upswing.</p>


<p>British capitalism has fallen further and
further behind her main rivals. In 1960 Britain's share of world
trade in manufactured goods was 16.5 per cent. In 1973 it had
fallen to 9.5 per cent.</p>


<p>While her rivals increased their industrial
production at a record pace, during the world economic upswing
British capitalism increased much more slowly. Consequently, her
position relative to her rivals declined.</p>


<p>The <em>National Westminster Bank Review </em>of
November 1975 points out that from 1969 to 1974 Britain's
National Product increased by 11.4 per cent in real terms. But
industrial production only increased by 6.7 per cent in real
terms. 'Thus industrial production fell by 5 per cent in relation
to the National Product.'</p>


<p>Again, industrial production in the ten years
from the first quarter of 1955 to the first quarter of 1965
increased by 35 per cent. But in the next ten years it increased
by only 15 per cent.</p>


<p>'Thus the annual growth of industrial
production has actually fallen by one half since 1965.'</p>


<p>Productive capacity increased by 35 per cent or
3 per cent per annum between 1955 and 1965, by 22 per cent or 2.5
per cent per annum between 1965 and 1973. Since 1973 the growth
rate has been only 1.5 per cent.</p>


<p>The ratio of net investment to value added was
8.6 per cent in 1965. It was only 3 per cent to 5 per cent in
1971-73. Inclusive of investment in petrol and gas it rose in
1974 to 6.3 per cent. But without petrol, for the rest of
industry, it was only 4.9 per cent. The ratio of gross investment
in industry fell from 17 per cent in 1965 to 14 per cent in 1972
and 1973.</p>


<p>However, as the <em>National Westminster Review </em>says:
'Government statisticians believe that something like 10 per cent
of industrial production must be invested in industry each year
to maintain the industrial capital stock and make good wear and
tear, technical obsolescence...' According to estimates they
quote, industrial capital stock increased by 8.6 per cent of
industrial production in 1965, only 3.4 per cent in 1972 and 4.1
per cent in 1973. This has worsened since the recession and the
following squeeze. The rate of growth of productive potential is
now only 2 per cent per annum.</p>


<p>The rate of net investment fell by one-half
during 1965-74 and employment fell by 12.5 per cent in
manufacturing in the same period. The 'de-industrialisation' of
Britain, of which Tony Benn has spoken, is shown by the fact that
<em>industrial profits </em>have not been ploughed back but
invested in more profitable fields <em>outside </em>industry. 19.1
per cent of industrial production was invested outside industry
in 1965. This had risen to 26.5 per cent in 1973.</p>


<p>An OECD report points out that Britain 'has
lost ground not only in productivity but in quality, design,
punctuality of delivery, and after-sales delivery, and
after-sales service...'</p>


<p>The <em>Midland Bank Review </em>of May 1977
says: 'Economic miracles seem at a discount, and the prospect is
for no more than a minor upturn in a long recession.'</p>


<p>Manufacturing in Britain accounted for 37 per
cent of employment in 1961, and only 30 per cent in 1976, such
has been the fall in the rate of industrial investment. With
shipbuilding, for example, Britain's share of world production in
1955 was 26.6 per cent; in 1976 it was 4 per cent.</p>


<p>In 1960 Britain's share of world manufactured
goods exported was 15.3 per cent, according to statistics
compiled by the OECD. In 1975 this had dropped to 8.9 per cent.
France and Germany's share remained about the same. France's
share of world exports fell only by 0.1 per cent to 9 per cent.
But now it slightly exceeds the British share.</p>


<p>Germany's industrial exports, which were about
20 per cent higher in 1960 at 18.2 per cent of world exports of
manufactured goods, are now more than double those of Britain.</p>


<p>Italy, the other sick man of Europe, has
increased her share of world manufactured exports by nearly half
from 4.5 per cent to 6.7 per cent. This is a little over 2 per
cent less than Britain, whereas in 1960 Britain's share was three
times as great.</p>


<p>The one economy of world capitalism that really
developed in the last two decades was that of Japan. In the
period of capitalism's impasse, that will guarantee future
convulsions. For the moment Japan has outstripped her rivals in
development of exports. From less than half that of Britain, at
6.5 per cent in 1960, she has increased her share nearly 2.5
times to 15 per cent - more than 50 per cent higher than the
share of Britain.</p>


<p>The USA still remains the world's biggest
industrial exporter, though her share of world trade has declined
somewhat. It has fallen from 22.8 per cent in 1960 to 19.0 per
cent in 1975. But West Germany and Japan are treading on her toes
(Japan even in the American market) to anguished shrieks from the
industries affected.</p>


<p>The absolutely astounding collapse and
enfeeblement of British capitalism can be seen in these figures.
In the past, the British ruling class looked down on the 'lesser
breeds'. Through the virtually exclusive domination of the
empire, they could afford to concede a higher standard of living
in the upper layers of the working class and even the working
class a whole. Now, Denis Healey, the Chancellor, boasts to
industrialists that they have the cheapest labour of all the
industrialised countries, big and small. This was true already in
1975 <em>before </em>the 'Social Contract' and the deep cuts in the
living standards of the working class.</p>


<p>The United States Bureau of Labour Statistics
for 1975 gives the average hourly remuneration in industry,
according to preliminary estimates in the leading industrial
countries. For the UK it was $3.37. Japan had increased her wage
rates by practically three times since 1970 reaching $3.32&#8212;a
negligible difference from Britain. Now she has outstripped
Britain in this field as well!</p>


<p>In France the hourly pay in industry was $5.47.
West Germany was $6.21 and the disparity has increased yet
further since 1975. Even the pay of workers in formerly backward
Italy considerably exceeded that of British workers reaching
$5.51 per hour in 1975. The United States rate was $7.26, second
highest in the world to Sweden. These wage rates do not take into
account the level of prices, which is far higher in all these
countries than in Britain. Nevertheless, it is a rough index of
how the British workers, from being among the highest paid, have
now fallen to the status of the 'coolies' of Western Europe.</p>


<p>One of the peculiar problems of British
capitalism is the domination of the City of London and thus of
finance-capital. Between 1975 and 1976, 'invisible exports' ie
shipping, insurance, banking, dividends from investments abroad
and tourism rose by 25 per cent to &pound;13,000 million - <em>more
than half </em>the total value of exports. With 9.9 per cent of
the worlds' invisible earnings, British capitalism was second
only to Wall Street.</p>


<p>The division of interests in Britain between
the City (finance-capital) and industrial capital is one of the
causes of the steep decline in industrial strength of British
capitalism. Concerned only with financial return rather than the
production of real wealth in the form of factories, machinery and
consumer goods, the City has sapped and undermined the economy of
the country. It is these contradictions which have undermined
completely the role of British capitalism on a world scale.</p>


<p>The partial turning of Britain into a parasitic
<em>rentier </em>state, similar to that of France in the past, has
been the result of the export of capital and services such as
banking and insurance. A Treasury Report of June 1977, confirms:
'Gross invisible receipts were &pound;13,700 million per annum and
that <em>invisible earnings now exceed the value of the export of
finished manufactures </em>and, last year, were equal to over half
the earnings from all exports of goods.'</p>


<p>'In the recession years of 1971, 1972 and 1975,
about one million manufacturing jobs disappeared', according to
the <em>Economic Progress Report </em>of the information division
of the Treasury of June 1977.</p>


<p>As late as 1970 there were 8.2 million people
employed in manufacturing, but in 1977 the total was only 7.2
million. Average production per head in 1977 was only equal of
that in 1973. But 1973 manufacturing output-per-person-employed
was 15 per cent lower than in 1970! This indicated a critical
fall.</p>


<p>The reason for this is the failure of big
business to invest the surplus extracted from the labour of the
working class. <em>Management Today </em>in its issue of July 1977
admits: 'Investment in British manufacturing industry remains
low. Since (1965) total capitalisation per worker has fallen well
behind that of Britain's EEC partners and other industrial
nations. It is not uncommon to find capital available per worker
in West Germany, say, amounting to 2-3 times the British level -
particularly in such industries as motor manufacturing.'</p>


<p>In 1972, Japan's investment ratio to Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) was 34.4 per cent; West Germany 26.3 per
cent; France 26.34 per cent; Sweden 22 per cent; and the UK 18.2
per cent</p>


<p>Thus Britain has fallen further and further
behind in the booms and recessions of the post-war period. In
1965 capital expenditure per employee in manufacturing industry
was &pound;142. In 1970 this had reached &pound;191 and then fell back in
succeeding years to &pound;158 in 1975.</p>


<p>All the measures taken by the government in the
post-war period to 'control the economy' have only made the
situation worse. However, in the main, the same ills affecting
British capitalism have affected her rivals as well. Such is the
case with the tendency for the rate of profit to decline. The
fall in West Germany and other countries has been as steep. But
the surplus in Britain has flowed into property speculations,
service industries, investment abroad etc., and not back into
manufacturing.</p>


<p>In the Bank of England <em>Quarterly Report </em>of
March 1976, it was estimated that the 'real' (ie after interest
and other charges) return on capital employed by industrial
companies fell from about 11 per cent in the early 1960s to
around 4 per cent within the decade, and was down to 2 per cent
in 1974.</p>


<p>The OECD confirmed this by pointing to the fall
in rates of return on capital employed by industrial companies
from about 12 per cent in the first half of the sixties to 4 per
cent - 'among the lowest in the OECD area'.</p>


<p>In their blind greed for profit, each monopoly,
combine, bank trust or individual capitalist is only concerned to
maximise its returns, without worrying about the resulting effect
on the economy as a whole. Thus the enormous speculation in
property until the bubble burst recently. Now there is as much
speculation in agricultural land as there was formerly in
building property. The money pouring into agriculture matches
that still pouring into buildings.</p>


<p>Despite a heavy premium on money invested
abroad, it remains at a very high level, reaching &pound;1500 million
in 1976. Lavish inducements have been given to industry and a
'bonanza' of nearly &pound;2000 million a year extra profit made out
of the limitation of wages by the Labour government's 'Social
Contract'. In spite of this, investment is still very sluggish in
1977 and according to projected figures, may reach an increase of
only 3 per cent over the low levels of recent years.</p>


<p>This means a further falling behind for
Britain. The 100 monopolies which control 80 per cent of British
exports use currency fluctuations to increase their profits
rather than to increase the share of Britain on world markets.
Consequently the situation for British capitalism is actually
worsened. Prices of imported manufactured goods rise, but British
capitalism does not gain even the advantage of a breathing space
for new investment. The monopolies will not increase investment
to increase capacity because their market abroad is not increased
and inflation further limits their market at home.</p>


<p>As<em> The Director </em>of June 1977 cynically
observes '...in a world of complex products, multi-national
corporations, oligopolistic competition, price leadership and
price discrimination...short term exchange rate changes are
likely to be regarded as a windfall addition to profits.'</p>


<p>During the course of the post-war period, the
'Welfare State' was the theme of the speeches and articles of the
right wing and left wing reformists. The 'difference' between
Britain and other countries was emphasised by the right wing
theorists like John Strachey, Douglas Jay, Anthony Crosland, Roy
Jenkins, and others. In this, they merely echoed the propaganda
of the spokesmen of big business.</p>


<p>Now nothing is left of the 'Welfare State'
except the shell. In comparison with most of the main capitalist
countries, the British workers are worse off in welfare
expenditure. More of the GNP of many of these countries goes on
transport, health, education, social services and unemployment
pay, than in Britain. This was so even before the drastic cuts of
1976 and 1977.</p>


<p>The expenditure by the state and its share of
GDP was not much different in Britain to that of her main
European rivals, contrary to the poisonous propaganda in the
media. The massive cuts of the last three years, in fact, must
have brought state expenditure's share of GDP below that of her
major competitors.</p>


<p>These cuts have been mainly in public sector
investment, because the local and state authorities have found it
difficult, especially with an inflation rate of 17 per cent, to
cut actual expenditure. It has been estimated by government
statisticians that, on present levels, by 1978-9 public sector
investment will be back to the level of 1965, in real terms, 13
per cent below the average since 1966.</p>


<p>This will mean a further fall in the 'social
wage' in coming years. As an article in <em>Management Today </em>of
July 1977 cynically comments: 'Perhaps because of the fanfare
with which this was introduced, the cost of the British welfare
state has ever since been the main target of those who reject the
phenomenon altogether...'</p>


<p>John Strachey, who wrote <em>Contemporary
Capitalism </em>as an apology for the policies of right wing
reformism, must be turning in his grave. If the contemporary
right wingers are not writhing it is because those in the Cabinet
and government have, as predicted abandoned all the false
shibboleths of reformism and adopted instead a programme of
'extremist' Tory measures to try and save capitalism. Of course
they will be impaled on the contradictions this engenders in the
struggle between the classes for the division of the national
product produced by the labour of the working class.</p>


<p>So far as health expenditure is concerned,
despite the former fame of the National Health Service, Britain
is falling behind in her percentage of GNP devoted to health. In
the field of medicine and health care the UK spends 4 per cent of
the GNP. Her main rivals spend far more: Holland 5 per cent; West
Germany and France 6 per cent; Sweden 7 per cent; and the USA 6.5
per cent.</p>


<p>In fact in practically every field of social
services Britain is behind most of her rivals. This should give
her an advantage in the field of competivity. Her industrialists
have the lowest wages to pay and the highest subsidies; yet they
are falling further and further behind.</p>


<p>The continuation of sluggish production is due
partly to the measures of the government in the alleged fight
against inflation. These were, in reality, measures to cut the
share of the working class in the national product in order to
increase the share of the capitalists, in a vain endeavour to
give a push to investment.</p>


<p>Writing for the literate members of their
class, the journals of capitalism are sometimes brutally frank.
Thus <em>Management Today </em>of July 1977, says on the so-called
Social Contract, 'the unions...accepted what was, in everything
save the name, an enforced restraint of wages.'</p>


<p><em>The Economist, </em>right wing Tory journal,
points out that the 'stage 2 agreement...cut real earnings by a
remarkable 7 per cent. This is a signal achievement. No previous
post-war income policy, statutory or voluntary has achieved such
a gap between pay and prices.' (23 July 1977)</p>


<p>The real secret of the world economic upswing
was the dovetailing of a whole series of factors, all interacting
on each other. One of them was increased division of labour with
the greatest increase of world trade for a whole historical
period. This led to a dismantling of tariff barriers and many
other obstructions to trade. Another factor was the development
of new industries on the basis of the expansion of the world
market</p>


<p>This in turn led to increased standards of
living in the industrialised countries. Increased super-profits
were wrung by the industrialised countries from the colonial
world, and a whole series of other factors led to the expansion
of the market. This in turn led to an explosion of investment in
the capitalist world. Investment of a great part of the surplus
extracted from the labour of the workers is the vital essential
for the development of an economy. Most of the OECD countries
were re-investing 25 per cent of total output each year. In the
inter-war period the average had been less than half that, at 12
per cent. It was usually less than 10 per cent per annum in the
nineteenth century. Since the war, Britain's investment has been
lower than that of her rivals.</p>


<p>British capitalism for the whole of the
twentieth century has been sluggish in investment. Previously she
relied on her entrenched position and her accumulated wealth and
industrial power.</p>


<p>All these advantages have disappeared. Even in
banking, the French and German banks are now bigger than the
British banks. The <em>Banker </em>of June 1977, laments: 'Our list
of top 300 banks in the world...reveals sharp declines in the
rankings of the major British banks. No British bank is amongst
the ten largest banks. Barclays has slipped to twelfth place,
National Westminster to twentieth, Midland to fortieth and Lloyds
to forty-second place. At the other end some merchant banks have
dropped out of the list altogether. Japanese, French and German
banks have taken up the running.'</p>


<p>Thus even the City has not been exempt from the
general decline of British capitalism.</p>


<p>With the change in the world economic outlook
the situation has changed for the worse for British capitalism.
From a haughty dispenser of favours she has become a supplicant.
Despite the favourable factors of coal and now <em>oil </em>resources,
the capitalists, afflicted by the general crisis, have not taken
advantage of the measures of the Labour government which
restricted the share of the working class in the wealth they
produce. The capitalists, fearful of a new slump, have not been
prepared to invest in manufacturing when only 80 per cent of
productive capacity can be used because of the restriction of the
market by wage restraint and cuts in state expenditure.</p>


<p>The reformists have been endeavouring to
increase the profits of the capitalists by cutting the share of
the workers and to cure inflation by cutting budget deficits. But
they are caught on the other horn of the dilemma of capitalism -
without big profits the capitalists will not invest. The result
has been that in 1976, despite the practical standstill in
production, the volume of imports (excluding oil) rose by 8 per
cent.</p>


<p>Manufacturing output in 1976 was 6 per cent
below the level of the crisis year of 1974. This was the year of
the 'confrontation' politics of Heath leading to the three-day
week and an enormous loss in production. Last year, too, the
output of the building industry fell by 17 per cent compared to
that of 1973.</p>


<p>Personal income, according to official figures,
fell by 0.5 per cent. 'Consumer spending' in 1977 fell a further
1.5 per cent in April to June 1977. This downturn depressed the
market.</p>


<p>All the sacrifices and falling living
standards, all the state cuts in the social wage have not moved
the hard-faced and hard-fisted capitalists. They failed in their
objective. The programme of counter-reforms has left British
capitalism in an even worse state than formerly.</p>


<p>The crisis of capitalism has produced different
wings among the politicians and among the economic witch-doctors.
Some are willing to risk a further bout of inflation by
increasing state expenditure to try and increase the markets. <em>Others,
the majority, are in favour of even more drastic cuts in state
expenditure. </em>All are for holding down the wages of workers.</p>


<p><em>The windfall of North Sea oil </em>(only
rendered economic by the quadrupled price of Middle East oil) <em>will
not solve the problems of British capitalism. </em>If the price of
oil on the world market were to drop in the next recession it
would cut some of the advantages of British oil production. The
oil is extracted at fifteen times the cost of extraction of the
oil of the Arab states.</p>


<p>But even if the oil price remains steady, or
continues to rise slowly, the main advantage will be to remove
one element of instability in the British economy. It could
result in a favourable balance of payments in world trade and
increase the revenue of the state by some few per cent. But it
will not change this fundamentally.</p>


<p><em>The Economist </em>of 23 April 1977, points
out:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Britain's pessimists like Mr Wynne Godley
of Cambridge believe that private industry is more likely to
slide from recession to extinction - a slow death obscured by an
oil-buoyant balance of payments; that the government is likely to
float sterling too high too long on that buoyancy, eroding export
profit margins and pushing Britain's share of less than exuberant
world trade down even more sharply; and that a strong boost to
the economy is needed to raise growth from Mr Healey's forecast
1.5 per cent for 1977-8 to 5 per cent a year, if Britain is not
to emerge from its oil years with 3 million unemployed and a
skeletal industrial base.&quot;</p>


<p class="fst">The reformists, like the bourgeois, would like
a high growth rate, but are constrained by the inevitable
increase in inflation that further deficit-financing would
engender. That is why they have capitulated to the treasury
'experts', who really decide policy, and to the pressure of big
business.</p>


<p>Thus the spokesmen of capital vacillate between
the 'orthodox' monetarists and the neo-Keynesians. Both sets of
'remedies' are worse than the disease.</p>


<h4>The Conservative Party</h4>

<p>An inevitable future split in the Conservative
Party between the right wing 'ultras' and the so-called
'moderates' is foreshadowed by the differences between Keith
Joseph and the shadow Labour Minister, James Prior, over the
Grunwick strike.</p>


<p>The right wing Bourbons, using the
'philosopher' Joseph as a front (though his views are of the
blackest reaction) want an out-and-out struggle against the trade
unions, bringing down the full force of the state and the 'law'
against the organised workers. They represent one wing of the
ruling class, which comprises those sections of big business who
are financing the National Association For Freedom (NAFF)
<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup> -
'freedom not to belong to a union' ie the 'divine right' of
employers to tyrannise and doubly exploit unorganised workers in
getting them to meekly accept low wages, their 'right' to decide
everything in the workshop and to destroy the 'closed shop' - the
solid defence of the well organised workers.</p>


<p>This split in the ruling class party of big
business - which will be patched up and papered over for the
moment - is an indication of the beginning of a revolutionary
crisis in Britain. It is only at moments of great social tension
and stress that the ruling class openly reveals their differences
in strategy and tactics. That is especially so in the case of the
Tory Party in Britain.</p>


<p>This party has based itself not only on the
interests of the capitalist class and landowners. It has also
rested on the active support of the different layers of the
middle class - especially its professional and upper layers - and
on the passive support of an important minority of the
politically backward workers - including even a third of the
workers organised in the trade unions.</p>


<p>The support of these sections is due only to
the bankruptcy of the policies of reformism. Labour governments
have solidified and hardened the prejudices of these layers by
their failure to carry out their promises and programme when in
power. Without this Support the Tory Party would long ago have
collapsed. The failure of the last Tory government with their
policy of confrontation with the unions and the working class
reduced them to a suburban and mainly South East England party.</p>


<p>The counter-reforms of the right wing Labour
government have allowed the Tories to make an <em>electoral </em>recovery.
The disillusionment with increased inflation, greater
unemployment and lower living standards has meant a comeback.</p>


<p>But the background to this comeback is the
sickness of British capitalism sketched in these perspectives.
For a time the Tories tried to paint themselves as a second party
of reform - Tweedledum to Labour's Tweedledee. In fact, after the
<em>deflationary </em>policies of the 1964-70 Labour government, it
seemed for a moment that the parties had changed roles. With the
failure of the policies of the first two years of the Heath
government, the Tories became a party of heavy state expenditure
as against Labour's 'orthodox' financial policies of the last
period of office.</p>


<p>In reality this merely reflected the desperate
crisis of British capitalism and the frenzied policies of the
representatives of big business to find a way out. Now, in place
of the Labour government's policy of savage cuts and measures to
reduce living standards, <em>the Tories stand for a policy of even
more draconian cuts in state expenditure </em>and even deeper cuts
in living standards.</p>


<p>On this theme the ravings of the former 'sober'
journal - the voice of Toryism and of big business - <em>The
Times, is </em>an indication of the cul-de-sac in which British
capitalism finds itself. Some Tory MPs, reflecting the views and
interests of 'the City', (ie finance-capital) even rationalise
the bankruptcy of British capitalism. They seriously suggest the
'service' sector (ie insurance, banking, and investment abroad,
tourism, catering etc) should replace manufacturing industry as
the basis of British capitalism.</p>


<p>By the enormous investment of the surplus
produced by the workers overseas and the services of the City,
they wish to undertake a caricature of the role French capitalism
played pre-World War One and partially between wars. But the
world situation has changed. Upheavals abroad would be reflected
in Britain.</p>


<p>This same wing of the Tories, like the rest, is
also constantly raving about the need for more expenditure on
arms and <em>more </em>arms. With a shrinking industrial base that
would impose even greater burdens on the workers. This parasitic
clique has long forgotten that the only real wealth is
manufacturing wealth and that investing abroad, especially in the
'under-developed' world, is to give hostages to fortune.</p>


<p>Rather than the 3 million unemployed which
Keith Joseph complacently contemplates, a shrinking industrial
base would mean 5 or even 7 million unemployed with one third of
the population redundant to requirements. Britain is a
manufacturing nation or it is nothing.</p>


<p>But the threshing about of the Tories like a
wounded ox (an appropriate analogy for the castrated capitalism
they would see) is itself a symptom of the deep crisis of British
capitalism. The switch from Keynesianism to 'monetarist' ravings
is an empirical expression of the blind alley of world and
British capitalism.</p>


<p>The ruling class tried to crush and tame and
render impotent the organised working class, using the
Conservative government as its instrument. In this first dress
rehearsal they were defeated, without a real mobilisation of the
working class by the trade union leaders, or even a clear
explanation of the issues and what lay behind the battle. This
was not even a real show-down because of the weakness of British
capitalism's forces and the mighty potential and actual strength
of the organised working class.</p>


<p>But the desperate situation of British
capitalism forces the ruling class to try and undermine their
moral enemy whom they regard with fury and hatred - the organised
working class. <em>If they come to power, driven forward by the
pressures of their class needs, the Tories will try again to
undermine, subvert and tame the unions.</em></p>


<p>The stark reactionism of Thatcher, Keith Joseph
and Heseltine shows that this is an undercurrent within the Tory
Party. The cannibalistic ravings against the closed shop, from
the Secretary General of the Institute of Directors, Jan
Hildreth, in <em>The Director, </em>shows the feelings of his
class. He claims the support of the overwhelming majority of
directors in industry and commerce.</p>


<p>They work empirically from day to day without
thinking or really understanding the relation of forces and what
tomorrow will bring. Yesterday they leaned heavily on the Labour
government 'to do the dirty work', as Tory MPs explained in the
lobby of Parliament and in the privacy of their clubs. No-one but
a right wing Labour government could impose big cuts in standards
of living and reduce the welfare state to a decrepit shadow of
what it had been.</p>


<p>'The Moor having done his duty...' the ruling
class is preparing to abandon him. When the labour and trade
union leaders can no longer hold back the movement of the workers
to regain what they have lost in living standards during the last
three years, the capitalists will turn towards an open
reactionary government either of the Tories or a National
government.</p>


<p>In spite of the lessons of 1970-4 the
representatives of capital are preparing to embark on a new
conflict with the unions. Politics is not a question of
rationality but the movement of class forces, dictated in the
last analysis by class economic interests. The crisis of the
system is such that they must attempt again a showdown with the
unions.</p>


<p>This is a recipe for class conflict which
dwarfs anything in British history. Gone is the boast about the
British 'genius for compromise' which was the theme <em>ad nauseam
</em>of the media in the whole of the post-war period. It is
certainly true that British capitalism in the past could work on
the principle of agreement and bargaining with the working class,
owing to her privileged position, stemming from her industrial
ascendancy and the centuries of pillage of the colonial and other
peoples.</p>


<p>That was the historical basis of 'enlightened
Toryism'. The fat years are now ended and an epoch of lean years
begins. There is no room for compromise, except very temporarily,
between the classes. Consequently Toryism will be forced more and
more to reveal its real policy - the defence of the interests of
big business.</p>


<p>If only the labour and trade union 'lefts' had
one per cent of the determination and will of the strategists of
capital, the social overturn would be smooth and peaceful. In
addition, in a primitive way - a groping and empirical way -
these strategists work on the basis of perspectives. The labour
and trade union leaders, right and left, prepare nothing and
foresee nothing; they act only when they get burned by the fire
of events.</p>


<p>The Tories have been emboldened by the recovery
of their support. But the support they have regained is from the
disillusioned middle class, many traditional supporters of the
Labour Party, typified by the now reactionary playwrights John
Braine and John Osborne, and the journalist Paul Johnson. They
reflect the frenzy of the middle class, faced with high taxes and
declining living standards.</p>


<p>In addition sections of the lumpen-proletariat
and the politically backward workers have swung back to the
Tories. But the basic core of organised labour has remained
faithful to its traditional organisations.</p>


<p>This means that an election victory either for
the Tory Party under its own banner or under the disguise of a
National government would be a Pyrrhic one. Their electoral
recovery in the industrial areas of England and in some areas of
Wales and Scotland will be very temporary. Even in the middle
class suburbs they will lose ground as the crisis of capitalism
in Britain and the world develops. Their complete incapacity to
solve the problems of the workers or of the middle class will
become clear to the masses.</p>


<p>In elections and 'on the knocker' the Tories
conduct a campaign of demagogy and of lies to deceive the people.
But the real programme of the dominant leadership of Thatcher,
Heseltine and Joseph is the absolutely utopian one of a return to
the untrammeled exploitative society of Victorian times which
'built Britain's greatness'. The idea of 'back to Adam Smith' or
'back to laissez faire' is an impotent dream of the long gone
past.</p>


<p>The reality is the interest of the monopolies
which dominate the British economy. The reality will also be the
3 million unemployed to be used as a whip against the employed
and against the unions.</p>


<p>Any attempt to 'confront the unions' would soon
be abandoned because of the conflict it will provoke and the
impotence of parliamentary laws to make a decisive difference.</p>


<p>What is written with workers' organisation and
mobilisation cannot be changed by lawyers' tricks. That is why <em>The
Times, </em>reflecting the impotence of the ruling class, is
ultimately threatening - in effect - physical confrontation with
the workers. That is why supplies of CS gas, riot shields and
other paraphernalia are already being stockpiled and why shields
were used at Lewisham<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup> as a test.</p>


<p>Before the 1970 election the manoeuvres of the
Tories were similar. There was the Heathian 'Selsdon Man' and the
bloodcurdling threats to 'deal with the unions' and 'cut them
down to size'. The reality was different; the fantasies of
reaction and their actions provoked a counter-attack by the
organisations of the working class. The Tories were shattered by
trade union resistance, which included the miners' strike.</p>


<p>Now an even more hopeless period is opening up.
The projection of the production of 35 to 40 million tons of
steel by 1985 has been abandoned and a minuscule target of 25 to
27 million tons set instead. The latter figure is only as high as
that reached by British capitalism in 1973. This means a further
deterioration in living standards, far lower than the last three
years, and a continuation of the ruin and decay of Britain.
Consequently the support for a Tory government would melt away
faster even than in 1970-4.</p>


<p>But the ruling class prefers to rule through
their direct instrument, the Tory Party, where possible, both in
times of calm and in times of social turbulence. They concede to
Labour governments only when they perceive there is no other way
of 'disciplining' the workers at a time of crisis.</p>


<p>Now the large number of small strikes in every
area - affecting engineering and other industries - indicates
that the usefulness of the Labour government as a brake on the
movement of the workers is very limited.</p>


<p>In a period of turmoil, under pressure, a
Labour government would concede far more than a Conservative
government. If possible the strategists of capital would,
therefore, prefer a Tory or possibly a 'National government'.</p>


<p>If the next election is fought with the main
parties intact and under their own banner, it seems likely that
the Conservative Party will gain a majority, probably of 30 to 50
seats. The size of the majority will be small because of the
image of Thatcher-Joseph-Heseltine, and because a decisive
section of organised workers will rally round their party, the
party of the trade unions. But this is just an estimate of the
situation at the present time. It is always difficult to predict
the result of elections. This is especially true in a period of
volatility in class relations, with the sharp changes of opinion
in the working class and especially the erratic swings of opinion
in the middle class. <em>An epoch of reformism is at an
end. Reform and concessions can still be gained through pressure
and struggle, but can only be temporary. </em>At this time the
bourgeoisie prefers to try and install a reliable government
which will be prepared to serve its interests without looking
over its shoulder at the union leaders and the Labour Party.</p>


<p>Big business ruled and got measures in their
interests due to the acquiescence and acceptance of the trade
union leaders and the Labour government during the last three
years, although the interests of capital have always been decked
up as the 'national interest'. The right wing trade union
leaders, and sections of the left, through lack of alternative
policies (which would have meant a policy for the overthrow of
the rule of capital), persuaded the rank and file to accept lower
wages and the whittling down of the welfare state. They leaned on
the workers' loyalty and trust in their leaders and their
organisations. The faith of the workers was put at the service of
capital.</p>


<p>But the advanced workers have decided 'enough
is enough'. They see such policies resulting only in an electoral
weakening of the Labour government. They see the sacrifices as
having been useless, the numbers of unemployed getting worse and
inflation still continuing at a high rate. The ruling class too
has decided that that particular 'ballgame' is over. They must
look to different methods of rule, not the conveyor belt but
rather more open 'confrontation' and bludgeoning of the workers.</p>


<p>In the inter-war period and particularly during
the Tory government of 1951-64 there was a tacit acceptance by
the right wing trade union leaders and by the right wing leaders
of the Labour Party, of the 'divine right to rule' of the
capitalists and their representatives, the Tory Party.</p>


<p>The Labour Party was a tame and 'loyal'
opposition only suggesting meekly the amelioration of some of the
worst sores of capitalism The trade union leaders were ensnared
and entwined with the capitalist state; there had not been any
national official strikes for decades. The unions were regarded
almost as a department of the state machine.</p>


<p>But the developing crisis of decaying British
capitalism resulted in the election of a Labour government in
1964. By 1967-8 already there were symptoms of the breakdown of
this relationship by the pressures of the rank and file. Even
under a Labour government there were official national strikes
such as those of the seamen.</p>


<p>The strategists of capital evolved policies to
put the unions in a straitjacket through enforced collaboration
of the unions with the state in lowering living standards. This
was the meaning of 'In Place of Strife', Labour's proposed
anti-union bill which was smashed by the resistance of the unions
and the rank and file of the Labour Party.</p>


<p>The attempt of capital, through the Labour
leaders, to force this collaboration with the state was
unsuccessful, however. The pressure of the workers, the move to
radicalism and the active participation of the advanced layers
led to a partial transformation of the unions. Left leaders more
sensitive to the pressures of the rank and file were elected.
They broke away from the embraces of the state machine.</p>


<p>In a sense the same process is taking place at
the present time though the union leaders are terrified of the
possible consequences. Cautiously the 'Social Contract' wage
restraint policies have been repudiated at conferences and at the
TUC, though the leadership has succeeded in formal votes
reaffirming the rule that there should only be one wage claim
every twelve months. Whether they can make this hold remains to
be seen.</p>


<p>Protest against actual cuts in living standards
has been muted. The trade union leaders have been terrified of
the consequences of an avalanche of strikes and social conflict.
In 1968 to 1970 they were prepared to show the way in defence of
the workers' living standards. Paradoxically, the repetition of
the same process has been muted by fear of a clash with the
forces of the state, opening up incalculable consequences.</p>


<p>The secret discussions between the Tory Shadow
Labour Minister, Prior, and leading members of the TUC (including
former left wingers like Scanlon and Jones) were intended to find
a way of compromising with the Tories if they come to power.</p>


<p>The TUC is trying to avoid a clash with the
state similar to 1970-4, which had been provoked by the
Industrial Relations Act. But the clash was not caused simply by
the wish or the stupidity of the ruling class. It was caused by
the frightful decay of British; capitalism. <em>It was the
expression of the irreconcilable clash of class interests in the
division of </em>'<em>the national cake</em>'.</p>


<p>The TUC would like to return to the
relationship they had with the Tories and the state of 1951-64.
They are terrified of the implications of a renewed battle on the
lines of 1970-4, not because the unions are weak but because they
are <em>stronger</em>! Despite mass unemployment, more
workers are organised than in the whole of British history - 11.5
million - more than half of the working population. A much higher
proportion of the industrial working class is now organised than
ever before in Britain.</p>


<p>Lenin conceived that it would be very difficult
under capitalism for more than one-third of the workers to become
organised in unions. Yet, in most of the industrialised world,
the unions now comprise the majority of the working class. That
is the expression of the immense power accumulated by the working
class during the last three decades.</p>


<p>The TUC leaders and the 'sober and moderate'
Tory representatives of capital (terrified by their own
weakness as revealed in the events of 1970-4) may wish to come to
an agreement. But such an agreement will be built on sand. The
rabid bayings of the directors against the closed shop indicate
the real attitude of capital.</p>


<p>On the other hand, the sweet cooings of
Margaret Thatcher are a deception (her ideas are in reality those
of Keith Joseph). She merely intends to paper over the cracks in
the unity of the Tory Party before a general election. As a
representative of capital she does not wish to rouse the trade
union movement to mobilise the workers in advance. The serious
strategists of capital wish to avoid a conflict. It is a
different situation to that of 1926 or 1937-9. The ruling class
prepared to provoke the General Strike on the one hand and
confidently prepared in the latter period, for a bloody
repression of the workers through civil war.</p>


<p>Now, because of social weakness, the ruling
classes wish for some sort of <em>modus vivendi </em>with the trade
union leaders, some sort of arrangement like that of 1951-64. The
union leaders, fearful of the forces awakened and aroused in the
mass movement of 1970-4, are only too willing to reciprocate and
as Len Murray the General Secretary of the TUC said: 'Talk
business with any government.'</p>


<p>But the decline of Britain, in the long term,
makes this impossible. The social forces of workers and bosses
cannot be reconciled. Conflict will open up, opening up in turn,
not differences but great rifts in the Tory Party as to how to
'deal with the organised workers'. Nor can the trade union
leaders hope to hold their members when they see further cuts in
living standards while the rotten bourgeoisie is further pampered
and cosseted with massive subsidies by the state.</p>


<p>The press, radio and TV - the entire mass media
- have conducted a poisonous campaign of vilification and
denigration for ten to fifteen years against the trade union
movement. The difficulty for them has been that practically every
section of organised workers in the different trade unions has
been involved in battle and suffered from the lies, distortions
and demagogy of the press since 1966.</p>


<p>In the meantime an element of control or, at
least, checking of arbitrary sackings, has developed in the
organised factories, workshops and even in organised offices and
amongst white-collar workers. Solidarity action for fellow
workers on strike has been developed in a whole series of
disputes. This is the first heat-lightning of even bigger actions
in the future.</p>


<p>Not seeing any mass alternative however, and
regarding the Labour government as their 'own' government for a
period of years, the rank and file of the trade union movement
has accepted increased unemployment, inflation and cuts in living
standards without mass protest.</p>


<p>The experience of the last three years has
resulted in the accumulation of an enormous pent-up anger,
resentment, frustration and bewilderment among the workers. The
changed votes at union conferences, and the refusal of the TUC
leaders openly to commit themselves to the 10 per cent limit on
wage increases of the 'third phase' of wage restraint, was a
reflection of this. The Tories might succeed in mobilising the
middle class, former Liberal voters and sections of the
politically backward workers in electoral terms, because of the
counter-reforms and counter-revolutionary policy of the right
wing government. But in terms of social forces, this will not be
decisive.</p>


<p>The mood of the workers is changing. They will
not tolerate from a Tory government, their class enemy, what they
would accept - for a time - from 'their' government. The world
economic situation, as well as the shaky national situation would
undermine the position of the Tory Party from its very first
days.</p>


<p>The social peace of 1951-64 cannot be repeated.
The crisis of capitalism has reached a chronic phase which
threatens to engulf the workers in poverty, want and penury.
Consequently, the battle of the workers will be more bitter.</p>


<p>Marx once wrote that a whole series of titanic
battles were necessary to educate the working class - a period of
wars and class struggles. The period of the last 70 years has
been such a period. If capitalism has only lost a third of the
world - and that mainly in the peripheral, backward areas - that
has been because of the role of Stalinism and reformism.</p>


<p>But in Britain the policy of 'enlightened'
reforms is now at an end. The ruling class is caught in the toils
of the contradictions of capitalism and its own incapacity to
fulfil the mighty role that it played in the past, a role that
was relatively progressive for a period.</p>


<p>It is not a question of 'rationality', as the
pragmatists in the leadership of the Labour Party and trade
unions have imagined in the past. It is the lack of resources on
a capitalist basis which demand the 'irrational' holding down of
the wages of the workers under a Labour government, cutting
consumption and therefore the market. If that is so under a
Labour government, caught in the toils and the contradictions of
capitalism, how much more so under the Tories?</p>


<p>The capitalists, in the last resort, do not
dictate policies. The <em>policies are dictated to them by the
crisis of their system, </em>for which there is no way out -
except possibly for a period, at the expense of the working
class. Workers are in no mood to accept tamely more sacrifices
and insecurity for the benefit of big business. This is because
of the impossibility of reconciling this fundamental
contradiction, which the reformist and Stalinist leaders can
never understand. Class conflict is inevitable.</p>


<p>The clash of forces will decide. The crisis -
the battle over the division of the surplus produced by the
workers - will therefore be very basic. There is not room for
much horse-trading and bargaining as there was during the period
of super-profits. Consequently, <em>despite the desires of the
representatives of both antagonists - union leaders and Tory
leaders - their relations will become even more stormy than under
the Heath government of 1970-4</em>. Under the pressure of their
impotence in the face of mass action a further differentiation
would take place in the Tory Party. A gulf would open up with the
backwoodsmen right wingers impatient at the failure to come to
grips with the trade unions and their leadership. The right wing
would be financed by the most impatient and the most stupid and
reactionary wing of big business. Fissures and even an open split
would develop in the Conservative Party.</p>


<p>At present both sides, capitalists and the
leaders of the trade unions, dread a general strike - the
capitalists because of their weakness, the trade union leaders
because of the massed strength of the forces behind them.
Nevertheless, there looms the possibility of a general strike as
the culminating point of a series of clashes in various
industries - local, regional and national - possibly within one
or two years of a Tory government coming to power.</p>


<p>If Mrs Thatcher is not prepared to support her
mentor, Joseph, in the question of legislation outlawing the
closed shop under the next Tory government, it is because such
legislation has been shown to be useless and had the opposite
effect on the organised workers. It was counter-productive and
merely imbued the workers with contempt for capitalist law which
was clearly operating in the interests of big business. It
demonstrated to the working class the immense latent power of
their organisations.</p>


<p>The events of 1970-4 taught the strategists of
capital a painful lesson. It was not possible to act on the level
of 1917-20 or 1926, dangerous as these actions were to the
capitalists. Even then a threat was posed to the existence of
capitalist society.</p>


<p>But they could secure the capitulation of the
trade union leaders without much difficulty. They could win a
victory in 1926, although at some cost, because the generals of
the enemy like JH Thomas, the railwaymen's leader, were bent on
capitulation from the first hour - indeed even before the strike
started.</p>


<p>As the great Marxists, Lenin and Trotsky
explained, an all-out general strike always poses the problem of
power. It is a question of either/or. Under modern conditions,
the problem would be even more starkly posed. With a Marxist
leadership, the trade unions could assume power peacefully, as
was possible in France in 1968.<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">(3)</a></sup> With the weakness of
Marxism within the labour movement and within the working class
at the present time, however, the problem will not present itself
in the same way in a possible future general strike. The results
could be very different to those of 1926. Before the general
strike Trotsky posed the possibility that it could push the
labour and trade union leaders into power. With the present
relationship of forces, a general strike could mean the collapse
of a Tory government and its resignation. It could force a
general election. Under such circumstances, with a roused working
class, Labour would win. A left Labour government would be
propelled into power with all the pressures that that would set
into motion.</p>


<p>The question is only posed here because it is
necessary for Marxists to understand and prepare for the
possibility of events which seem remote at the present time. <em>This
is a period of sudden turns and breakneck changes more that at
any other time in history. </em>The events in France of 1968 are a
warning that we must keep a sensitive finger on the pulse of the
changing mood of the working class.</p>


<p>The possible collapse of a future Tory
government would see the coming to power of a left Labour
government. Because of the acceleration and deepening of the
processes taking place within the working class and the absolute
impossibility of solving the problems of the crisis of capitalism
(except precariously for very short periods), such a government
might be forced, under the pressure of an aroused movement of
millions, to go much further than its leaders would think
possible at the present time.</p>


<p>The events in Chile in 1973 however, constitute
a warning of the lengths to which the ruling class will go in
defence of their profits and privileges, if they are able. It was
no accident that <em>The Times </em>and <em>The Economist </em>showed
approval of the coup in their editorials. The major world
industrial capitalist powers have re-adopted a democratic
posture, including the hypocritical espousal of 'human rights',
only because there is no viable alternative for the next period.</p>


<p>The example of Italy has highlighted their
dilemma. They have almost stepped over the point of no return in
preparing to organise a military police takeover and
dictatorship. Fear of the consequences, not love of democracy,
has stayed their hand - fear of a counter attack by the working
class on the lines of the Spanish workers' reply to the Franco
coup of July 1936. But this will not permanently hold them from
taking action, given the organic crisis of capitalism.</p>


<p>The position of the British workers is much
more powerful than their Italian brothers and sisters. Their
organisations are potentially much stronger. They constitute the
overwhelming majority of the population. It is this power which
causes the strategists of capital, like <em>The Times </em>editorial
writers, to gnash their teeth in impotent rage.</p>


<p>The ruling class would like to emasculate the
power of the trade union and labour movement and turn it into a
harmless eunuch, completely obedient to the whims and dictates of
capital. But they cannot do this easily. It would require a
surgical operation, ie civil war. Like the Italian ruling class,
they are not at all certain of victory under such circumstances.
They toyed with and swiftly rejected the idea of a military coup
in 1974; they were faced with the revolt of the miners, backed by
the labour and trade union organisations - at the bottom, and
even to a large extent at the top. They had to drop the idea and
were defeated in the subsequent general election.</p>


<p>For a whole historical period of years,
stretching to possibly even a decade or more, British capitalism
will stagger from crisis to crisis. The ruling class will swing
desperately from one government to another.</p>


<p>There will be further radicalisation of the
workers. Millions will be involved in political and trade union
activity. The middle class will swing feverishly from one side to
the other. The lumpen-proletariat will be stirred from its usual
passivity into political action. They too will swing from one
extreme to the opposite.</p>


<p>What we will have in Britain, given the deep
organic crisis, is the Italianisation of British politics.</p>


<p>There may even be the lunatic terrorist
activities of a home grown English variety of ultra-lefts. The
fascists have already begun such activities from the right. Like
a stagnant pond under the influence of social storms the scum
rises to the surface first.</p>


<p>But however long such a period will last,
because of the weakness of the subjective factor to take
advantage of this, in the ultimate, it will have to end in a
solution. The militarists will risk all and take to arms to crush
the labour movement even if it means civil war. <em>The social
crisis of Britain will be protracted. </em>It will end either in
the greatest victory of the working class achieving power and the
overthrow of the rule of capital, with the installation of
workers' democracy, or a military police dictatorship which will
destroy the labour movement and kill millions of advanced
workers, shop stewards, ward secretaries, Labour youth, trade
union branch secretaries, and even individual members of the
labour movement. The workers have an ominous warning - the
example of Chile.</p>


<p>These are <em>long-term perspectives </em>over
the coming period of 10 to 15 years. Events in Britain will be
affected by events on the Continent, such as developments in
Spain, Italy and France.</p>


<h4>Liberals</h4>

<p>The Liberals are a secondary party of big
business in the eyes of the strategists of capital. Their
function since the war was to prevent a complete and open
polarisation of society between the Labour Party, as
representatives of the workers, and the Tory Party, as the party
of big business.</p>


<p>In periods of Tory government with economic
difficulties and class conflict, the mass media, including the
press, TV and radio, skilfully built up the Liberals. The
calculation was to create a safety net to prevent disillusioned
elements, particularly among the middle class and among
politically backward workers, from swinging to a changing Labour
Party - one which was no longer a bulwark of stability for the
social system. Thus they would prevent the Labour Party from
gaining an absolute majority of the votes.</p>


<p>It is true that they were helped in this by the
timid and false policies of the Labour leaders. But leaving this
aside, the ruling class have always been fearful of the effect on
the workers of an absolute majority of votes for Labour,
particularly if the only other party was the Tories.</p>


<p>In periods of Labour government the need for a
safety net is not so pressing. The decisive section of big
business, and their obedient tools in the media, wish for a swing
to the Tories and a Tory majority. Thus the Liberals receive
mainly bad publicity when they are given any prominence at all.</p>


<p>While desiring the continuation of the Liberal
Party, for future use, the main goal of big business is a
systematic smearing of the Labour Party, to the benefit of the
Tories. Once right wing Labour has done sufficient to discredit
the ideas of 'socialism' the way must be cleared for a strong
reactionary Conservative government.</p>


<p>Consequently the ruling class does not worry
too much if the support for the Liberals shrinks and they become
a mere handful in Parliament. In any case, polarisation of the
classes tends to take place under such conditions. The
professional people and those sections of the middle class
inclined to vote Liberal tend to swing over to the Tories. Trying
to paint themselves as the 'middle way' between Labour and Tory,
the Liberals are almost obliterated by the class poles of
attraction.</p>


<p>The Liberals were 'converted' to proportional
representation when their support had dwindled to a small
minority of voters. They want that system because they hope to
hold the balance, like the Free Democrats in Germany, between the
two big parties.</p>


<p>Alarmed by the developing swing to the left of
the workers in the trade unions and the Labour Party, the media
started a campaign for proportional representation. This has been
dropped - for the present - because of the opposition of the main
group of Tory polititians led by Mrs Thatcher. They are afraid
that <em>they </em>will not gain an absolute majority of votes at
the next election. The possibility would exist then of an open
Lib-Lab coalition, or more likely, as in 1924 and in 1929-31, a
Labour government dependent on Liberal votes. This would be a
more decisive version of the present situation.</p>


<p>In addition, the Tories with their utilitarian
and empirical approach, thinking in fixed terms, see the Liberals
as permanent arbiters deciding whether there will be Tory or
Labour governments. (They see social processes very dimly and
only through the spectacles of their class interest, as well as
the narrow interest of their own political party and personal
ambitions). They have scented the possibility of a Tory majority
in the next elections. That determines their immediate policies
on this question.</p>


<p>Of course, with a Marxist policy and leaders,
the labour and trade union movement could gain a crushing
majority of votes in the polls. Even without it, the
intensification of the class struggles, which is inevitable in
the next stage, will see millions actively involved and
discussing politics.</p>


<p>A Tory government would mean further
instability of class relations The formula of
Thatcher-Joseph-Heseltine, giving further lavish concessions to
big business and taking away concessions to the workers (even if
the formula was diluted), would exacerbate relations between two
classes. Consequently, mass action, demonstrations and strikes
could then result in a sizeable majority of votes for Labour at
the polls in the future.</p>


<p>The Liberals have been squeezed because the
capitalists and their representatives the Tories are playing for
safety and the 'assurance' of rule by the Tories gaining a
victory at the next election.</p>


<p>The Liberal leaders have been the chief
propagandists for a 'National government'. This would mean a much
bigger contingent of Liberals in Parliament on the 'National
ticket' - a 'government comprising all parties' ie Tory, Liberal
and right wing Labour. The latter are not far removed from the
Liberals in outlook anyway, as Prentice, Taverne, Mayhew and
George Brown<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-4" name="doc-4">(4)</a></sup> have shown. There are others of the same ilk still in
the Parliamentary Labour Party.</p>


<p>Ironically, by the dialectic of the class
struggle, the polarisation of classes that this would involve
would mean, over a period, not the enhancement of the role of the
Liberals, but their massive destruction as a serious political
force.</p>


<h4>The Labour Government</h4>

<p>Disillusionment among the advanced workers at
the result of the policies of the Labour government is
widespread. Among the backward workers there has been a revulsion
against Labour politics.</p>


<p>The Social Contract was accepted grudgingly by
the workers because they believed the pleas of the Labour leaders
who argued that through the acceptance of sacrifices and lowered
standards of living they would secure the end of inflation and
mass unemployment. The promises of massive industrial revival
through greatly increased investment which would lead to greater
increases in living standards had their effect. In addition, the
appeals for patriotism and the 'Give a year for Britain' slogan
undoubtedly evoked a response.</p>


<p>But the main reason for this support was the
lack of a viable <em>mass alternative </em>that the workers could
see offering a way out. With the left trade union leaders
committed to acceptance of government policies, with only faintly
expressed criticism from the Tribunite MPs, the workers could see
no practical way out.</p>


<p>Even most of those militant layers of the shop
stewards' committees who were sceptical of the government's
promises and the attitude of their own union leaders could not
convince the rank and file on the shop floor that it was a
practicable proposition to take on the combined weight of the
employers, the government and their own union leaders at the same
time. The mood of the workers was to accept and hope for better
times in the short term future. After two years of falling living
standards, increased unemployment (which shows no sign of
abating) and with inflation still at a high level, the mood has
begun to change.</p>


<p>A 10 per cent limit on wage increases (the
official target) would not even allow compensation for the
inflation of 17 per cent let alone taking into account the level
of taxes which would reduce the increases for the higher levels
of earning by at least 30 per cent to 50 per cent. The excuse
used for increasing prices was 'extraneous influences', like
devaluation. This is one of the main causes of the present
inflation and represents a further cut in real wages as its
effects work through the economy.</p>


<p>The myth of wage increases being responsible
for price increases and for the rise in unemployment has largely
been exploded in the minds of the big majority of workers. The
attempts to maintain a third year of wage restraint, with the
support of the union leaders, has met resistance and has been
rejected by delegate conferences representing a majority of
workers and even at the TUC itself.</p>


<p>However, the limit of 12 months between wage
settlements was accepted by the TUC conference. There is enormous
pressure on the individual union leaders to make it stick.
Reluctantly, large sections of workers have accepted it. But it
just requires one important union to break through for it to
collapse. Even if there were a national strike on the issue by
one union the psychological barriers would be broken.</p>


<p>To maintain the 10 per cent limit on wage
increases will be virtually impossible. The hyena press would
once again be perfidiously howling that wage increases cause
inflation.</p>


<p>The slight fall in the inflation rate from 17
per cent to 16.5 per cent announced in September 1977 (on the
July figures) has been caused by the difficulties of the world
market and the fall in the price of raw materials and foodstuffs
imported from abroad. This trend may continue if the <em>decline
in the rate of increase </em>of world capitalist industry
continues and the capitalist world moves into recession and
slump.</p>


<p>But as in 1974-5 that will not mean a fall in
prices, merely <em>a fall in the rate of increase in prices </em>and
much bigger unemployment. Under present day capitalism the
workers are trapped between the devil of high inflation and the
deep sea of recession, suffering both at once in what has been
termed 'recession-flation' or 'slumpflation'.</p>


<p>After all the sacrifices, Britain will simply
have moved from slump to slump. The media, after the TUC
conference, changed tactics. They had been careful, slanting the
news to undermine the Labour government and even attacking the
Prime Minister, who ceased to be 'Sunny Jim' Callaghan and became
a 'shifty politician' not to be trusted. Now they changed to
present the situation of 'the country' as rosy - a balance of
payments surplus, inflation overcome, share prices booming, good
prospects for industry - 'Britain' is ready to leap ahead again.
The reason for this is that the organised workers want to regain
the standards of living lost over the last three years. They are
thoroughly angered by the results of enforced wage restraint.</p>


<p>The ruling class is still hoping that the 12
month rule can be maintained and that they can limit wage
increases by the fear of renewed inflation. Hence the propaganda
that there will be a 'solution' of British capitalism's problems
in the coming period. They gloss over and hide the fact that the <em>increase
in investment is miniscule and that there is an actual fall in
production.</em></p>


<p>The ruling class have - temporarily - reversed
their attitude to the Labour government in the faint hope that it
can still 'deliver the goods', through the aid of the trade union
leaders, and at least partially maintain wage restraint. The City
and the industrialists must hardly believe their luck in
succeeding to cut standards of living by the biggest amount in
over 40 years - and this without any mass upheaval.</p>


<p>One reason why the Labour government maintained
itself in power for a much longer period than the Marxists
anticipated was because the ruling class had no immediate
alternative. As long as the government was increasing their
profits and succeeding in holding back the workers, why risk a
change and stir up the opposition of the organised workers?</p>


<p>The acceptance by the workers of the measures
of the Labour government (because the organised workers saw no
other way out) had, as a further consequence, created the
political and industrial 'lull' which lasted for about 12 months.
It was not only a period of lull but even of mild reaction. The
right wing in the trade unions and the Labour Party had a
temporary resurgence. Amongst the advanced workers there was a
feeling of frustration and dismay, in many cases verging on
demoralisation.</p>


<p>A mood of pessimism and confusion swept the
advanced trade unionists and active Labour Party workers. This
mood, and the apathy and inertia of the mass, yet further
emboldened the worst reactionary elements in the
factories, even to the extent of the more demoralised elements
supporting, half-surreptitiously, the National Front.</p>


<p>One main reason for this development was the
lack of understanding on the part of the advanced layers of shop
stewards and active workers in the trade unions and labour
movement of perspectives and theory - ie the fundamental ideas of
Marxism. Historically of course, this is understandable, given
the policies of the left reformist trade union and labour leaders
and the degeneration of the Communist Party leadership.</p>


<p>What it meant was that, in the eyes of the
masses, the workshop union representatives and the leading
elements in the Party branches had no explanation and no
answer to the problems of inflation and unemployment.</p>


<p>In fact many millions even half accepted the
propaganda of the Labour and TUC leaders. Most were bewildered
and confused. This reacted on the mass of more inert and
politically indifferent trade unionists on the shop floor - even
on those closest to the rank and file workers, the shop stewards.
It was a case of one factor reacting on the other and back again.</p>


<p>Many of the most militant shop stewards,
councillors and Labour Party activists, failing to understand the
temporary mood of the workers, and instinctively recognising that
they were being duped, succumbed to moods of despair themselves.
The mood of the ranks infected the attitude of their leaders.
This in turn was relayed back further reinforcing the mild
reaction.</p>


<p>Even within the most revolutionary periods
there will be interludes of reaction, despair, frustration,
indifference and apathy. There will be irrational actions
and reactionary attitudes by broad sections of the working class.
Even advanced layers, not understanding the reasons for this, can
lapse into reactionary moods of despising and blaming the workers
for their apparent quiescence or particular mood, regarding
themselves as separate and apart from the workers. In a sense
that is the basis for Stalinism and reformism among some layers
of the advanced workers.</p>


<p>Experience will teach the workers en masse as
they move into activity, which will be forced on them by the
struggle against unemployment, for shorter hours, better
conditions etc, in defence of living standards and for their
improvement. They will come up against the granite barrier of the
world crisis of capitalism. More and more broad sections will
begin to understand that capitalism is responsible for their
daily problems and anxieties.</p>


<p>The real difficulty has been that the most
active and advanced workers in the trade union and labour
movement, though feeling this themselves, have not been able to
convey it to the working class as a whole, even to the rank and
file workers in the factories where they work. This problem
arises from the mix-education of militants by the Communist Party
and from the narrow, merely trade union 'education' of shop
stewards by the unions themselves.</p>


<p>The lull, in terms of the passivity of the
workers, is now at an end. There have been no big defeats of the
working class during the last three years.</p>


<p>In a sense the workers have been resting after
the Herculean struggles of 1970-4. They have waited on events,
hoping for some miraculous changes from the Labour government
which they brought to power.</p>


<p>Disappointed in their hopes, they have begun to
turn to the industrial struggle. Far more than in 1968-70 there
has been an epidemic of small strikes in most important
industries and in practically every sizeable town in every
region.</p>


<p>The media has deliberately refrained from
giving publicity to these strikes, as they have covered up
reports of strikes in other countries. They are afraid that, with
the present mood, the contagion may spread.</p>


<p>Only strikes such as the bakers', or ones
involving tens of thousands of workers in lay-offs or actions
like the strike in the car industry, have been given any real
publicity. The small strikes taking place are on a whole host of
different issues - victimisation, conditions, bonuses, holidays,
sick pay, pensions and wages among many others.</p>


<p>An important development is the large number of
small factories and workshops, previously unorganised or with
small union membership, fighting against sweatshop conditions and
for union organisation and recognition. Contrary to what the
sectarians would have us believe, this indicates the enormously
attractive power of the organised trade union and labour
movenent, inherited from the past.</p>


<p>It is no longer possible for the employers to
concede a comfortable and bearable standard of living - that is
why Callaghan and Healey have openly warned against attempts to
regain lost living standards, because British capitalism cannot
afford this. It will be impossible for any length of time for
trade union leaders to hold back their members. Pressure of the
members, particularly the active layers, will force them to
change attitudes as is the case with the miners, the railwaymen
and, partly, the TGWU leaders. With a conflict of interests of
massive proportions, the employers in the strong sectors of
engineering who employ large numbers of workers - on the docks,
in the car industry etc, will have to concede increases higher
than 10 per cent or face bitter strikes.</p>


<p>If the union leaders will not lead official
national strikes, over a period there will be a rash of
unofficial strikes in many areas. Learning that isolated action
would not be sufficient, there would then be the tendency to link
up through the shop stewards on a national scale to take joint
action.</p>


<p>Such mounting pressure is more likely to have
the result that union leaders would act on a national scale;
national strikes would be on the order of the day. The struggles
already involve skilled and unskilled, white collar as well as
industrial workers. Some of the mass production industries, like
Leyland and Fords, have seen big, unofficial strikes and
demonstrations.</p>


<p>What happened after similar periods of
'restraint' (ie after disguised cuts in real wages) will be
repeated on a higher scale, this time not during a period of Tory
government, but of Labour government. The Labour government can
maintain itself in power over the next months, and possibly into
the New Year, so long as it can maintain even a partial incomes
policy.</p>


<p>From the viewpoint of the capitalists this is
'the best government we have got' while it acts so favourably. It
is not accidental that, for the first time in history, the
possibility of the coming to power of a Tory government resulted
in a fall in shares on the Stock Exchange. &pound;1400 million was
wiped out in 24 hours in March of this year (1977), when the vote
of no confidence in the Labour government was being moved.</p>


<p>That expressed a lack of confidence that the
Thatcher leadership could prevent a titanic confrontation between
the classes. For the same reason, after the TUC's reassurance on
the 12 month rule, shares rose recently.</p>


<p>The inevitable exasperation of the working
class, expressing itself in mass action, will result in pressure
on the government, the TUC, the left Labour MPs and the union
leaders. This will be particularly so in the industrial unions
like the TGWU, the AUEW and even the GMWU.</p>


<p>Under such conditions, with a further fall in
production, any small reflationary measures from Healey, like the
suggested &pound;1000 million or even &pound;2000 million, will evaporate
like a drop of water on a hot stove.</p>


<p>Mounting unemployment of up to 2 million this
winter will get the government into serious difficulties. There
will be irresistible pressure for further action to be taken,
though it goes against the wishes of the TUC leaders who want to
do nothing but wait for a better situation next year.</p>


<p>The recession which is developing on a world
scale may be temporarily halted by panic measures on the part of
the powerful states of capitalism - West Germany, Japan and the
United States - and following them, the others. But marginal
measures of deficit spending etc, will be merely cosmetic without
affecting the situation fundamentally. If they are not then
successful, the decline in world trade of the last few months
will increase even further. That will have a catastrophic effect
on all the major capitalist countries, particularly the weaker
ones like Britain.</p>


<p>The big employers have had a profits binge
during the last few years of wage restraint. If the TUC and the
union leaders can succeed in compromising and preventing big
strikes in such industries as engineering and mining, there is
still the possibility of the minority Labour government
staggering on well into next year.</p>


<p>The strategists of capital are still hoping
that they can manoeuvre the trade union and labour leaders to
restore right wing control of the Labour Party, by new reforms
which would re-institute control by the right-wing over the NEC
and the constituencies. This would give them the old game of
Peter and Paul once again. They build their hopes on such
fantasies.</p>


<p>The objective situation which is developing
however - the collisions between the classes - would make this a
repulsive anachronism. The eggs have been broken, and cannot be
put back in the shell again. Any attempt on these lines would
provoke a violent reaction from the rank and file of the trade
unions and the Labour Party.</p>


<p>Such schemes are hatched in the editorial
offices of <em>The Times </em>and the Tory clubs where the right
wing Labour leaders and some right wing trade union leaders are
quite at home, completely remote from the rank and file of the
wards and union branches. The right wing of the Labour Party
still fantasises that it can restore complete and untrammelled
domination of the Labour Party and the trade unions as in the
'fifties' and early 'sixties'. They delude their cronies in big
business that this is still possible.</p>


<p>The serious elements like Roy Jenkins<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-5" name="doc-5">(5)</a></sup> have
accepted the impossibility of regaining complete control of the
Labour Party or of organising an intermediate 'social democratic'
(in reality pseudo-Liberal) Party through agreement, fusion or
alliance with the Liberals. He has departed to the lush pastures
of the EEC Comission. Brian Walden has followed to a highly paid
job in TV. Dick Taverne, Christopher Mayhew, Woodrow Wyatt
and Reg Prentice, being more obtuse, have tried the 'middle way'
and will sink into obscurity. The parlous plight of the Liberals
at the present time is sufficient testimony to this dead-end.</p>


<p>If there were a new 'golden age' of capitalism
internationally and nationally - a new period of capitalist
expansion - then a middle way would be a viable proposition. The
ruling class could make some concessions to the workers giving
them some crumbs from a greatly increased cake. But that is not
the perspective. More and more right wing ideas will seem
as if they come from an antediluvian past. The right wing MPs are
Neanderthal fossils.</p>


<p>The strategists of capital have inconsistent
and contradictory aims. On the one hand they try to paint a
picture of Callaghan and Healey having 'solved' the problems of
the economy, in order to reconcile the workers with the 12 month
rule, salvaging as much of the Social Contract incomes policy as
possible. On the other hand they wish to rub the noses of the
masses in the mess, to convince them of the errors and
consequences of 'socialism'.</p>


<p><em>The strategists of capital will switch to an
out and out reactionary government, more right wing than the
Tories have been for generations, </em>with its leaders even more
reactionary than Baldwin in the 1920s. But before they do that,
they will try and demoralise the working class by further attacks
on living standards, discrediting the union leaders by making
them accomplices of the Labour government in these measures.</p>


<p>Nineteen seventy-eight will be the fourth year
of the Labour government. This is the usual 'normal term' of a
government in Britain. Dialectically, one of the reasons for the
lasting in office of what is now a minority Labour government, is
the extreme enfeeblement of British capitalism. The government is
delaying an election like Mr Micawber in Dickens' novel, <em>David
Copperfield </em>- in the hope that 'something will turn
up'.</p>


<p>But the realities of the world market, the grim
fall in industrial production, in the output of real wealth, a
possible increase in the number of unemployed to close to 2
million during the winter all makes the outlook for what might
'turn up' quite grim.</p>


<p>The figures of profits and stock exchange
shares, the balance of payments figures, a small fall in
inflation, cannot provoke more than a passing euphoria, despite
the propaganda of the media. The workers will contrast them with
the continuing fall in their real wages, the lack of spending
money for a few 'extras', and the stark poverty of the lower paid
just above or, in many cases, below social security levels. This
will alienate them even more. The flaunting of the frivolous
waste of resources by the rich, while many more youngsters are
plunged into the insecurity and despair of life on the dole will
further anger the workers. More redundancies and more insecurity,
the lack of real investment in manufacturing industry will
infuriate the workers as the facts percolate through to them</p>


<p>The expectation of Denis Healey or, in reality,
the Treasury officials, of an increase in world trade giving
succour to the British economy was a gambler's throw against all
the odds. World trade is already beginning to fall and that will
create new difficulties for British capitalism.</p>


<h4>The Labour Party</h4>

<p>It now seems unlikely that the Labour Party can
win an election next year.</p>


<p>Organisationally the Party has suffered a
further decline. As its 1977 conference report shows, the
membership of the wards and constituencies has declined. In many
areas the wards and General Management Committees (GMCs) are
composed largely of old people. Many wards and GMCs have shrunk
to a handful of Neanderthal councillors, with a small clique of
supporters.</p>


<p>The right wing policies of the Labour
government are hardly a means of stimulating the active rank and
file with enthusiasm. Nor are they calculated to induce active
trade union workers and shop stewards to join. Most of those who
join, at present, are more likely to do so to oppose the present
policies of the government.</p>


<p>This steady decline in the active membership
has extended over more than a quarter of a century with many
minor ups and downs. But the decline in the passive dues-paying
membership has been even more marked.</p>


<p>Despite this there has been an even greater
decline in the power and influence of the Neanderthal MPs and
councillors. They retain a semblance of influence only in the
worst rotten boroughs, wards and GMCs that have a 'dead'
membership and a virtually complete lack of outside activity.
These are almost the only parties where the right wing has
succeeded in maintaining their influence.</p>


<p>Even there, the influx of some active people,
in many cases putting forward some sort of alternative policies,
can rapidly change the position. That is an anticipation and a
harbinger of the coming processes of change.</p>


<p>The experiences of the Labour government of
1964-70 and of the present Labour government are preparing
explosive changes of consciousness of the active workers in the
Labour Party and trade unions.</p>


<p>Also, within the broad masses - usually
apathetic or even luke-warm, politically - changes of
consciousness are forcing themselves to the surface under the
whip of necessity. As in the past, there remains a core of
organised workers supporting the Labour movement.</p>


<p>As events develop, particularly with a
reactionary government with Labour in opposition and the trade
unions and the Labour Party swinging to the left, new layers will
become active. They will turn inevitably to the mass trade unions
and to their political expression, the Labour Party.</p>


<p>What the sectarians on a world and national
scale are incapable of understanding is the practically
inexhaustible reservoir of support retained by the traditional
organisations of the working class, especially the Labour Party
in Britain.</p>


<p>Millions of workers, not awakened to active
political life, are being shaken up by the results of
capitalism's inability to maintain employment or to give
reasonable conditions of existence. They will turn to the trade
unions first and then, drawing political conclusions, will swing
to the Labour Party.</p>


<p>With the convulsions that capitalism is
suffering, a Thatcher-led Tory government would provoke countless
thousands of workers to mobilise against them. It was in this
sense that Marx spoke of the revolution sometimes needing the
whip of the counter-revolution. Of course Toryism is not
counter-revolution as such, but it will be a government of
counter-reforms in relation to the living standards and the
social wage and one of capitalist attack. It will correspondingly
rouse the active workers into opposition.</p>


<p>This will be because of an enormous wave of
criticism in the Labour Party and the trade unions as a
consequence of a new defeat for Labour, following the
counter-reformist policies taken by the Callaghan government. The
Labour Party, under a left, Tribunite leadership, will move
further towards radical policies than at any time in its history.
The groundswell of criticism will have this effect. In addition,
the influence of Marxism in the Labour Party will be increased.
It has already under difficult conditions, had a perceptible
effect in raising the level of consciousness wherever Marxist
ideas have been influential.</p>


<p>There will be an enormous ferment of ideas
among the workers, and hundreds of thousands will become active,
as the crisis deepens and the battle between the classes
develops. The clear ideas of Marxism must be expounded with a
patient, friendly approach. The platform of Marxism will gain a
greater support <em>as events demonstrate its correctness. </em>The
ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky will become a powerful
influence throughout the labour movement.</p>


<p>Nevertheless, initially the ideas of the left
Tribunite MPs and the left leaders will become the dominant ones
in the movement - both in the trade unions and the Labour Party.
In the decisive areas they will become almost completely dominant
and practically take control of the organisation of the Labour
Party and the unions.</p>


<p>In a sense <em>they would constitute the labour
movement. </em>Processes that have been accumulating for more than
a decade would have meant a quantitative leading to a qualitative
change.</p>


<h4>The Youth</h4>

<p>Mass unemployment will now be a permanent
feature of capitalism throughout the now shortened trade cycle,
both under 'boom' and 'slump' conditions. It bears particularly
harshly upon the youth and upon women workers.</p>


<p>More than half the unemployed are aged 25 or
under. Hundreds of thousands are going straight onto the dole
from university, colleges and schools. A great part of the
unemployed youth are black, without hope of a job.</p>


<p>The youth on the dole will be looking for an
explanation of their misfortune and a solution to their problems.
Hatred of the capitalist system will grow. Tens of thousands
could be won to the programme of Marxism. Even more important are
the new layers of youth entering employment in industry, the
factories and also the offices. They too will be looking for a
political lead. Tens and even hundreds of thousands of young
people in the schools and universities are worried about their
future.</p>


<p>New moods begin to affect the youth even before
they affect the working class as a whole, and before it moves
into action. In that sense they are like the students - a
barometer of moods in society as a whole.</p>


<p>In particular, the middle class fluctuates and
moves in a very violent and volatile way in periods of social
crisis. Electorally, for example, sections of the middle class in
Britain have swung 180 degrees to the Tories after swinging
completely against them in 1974.</p>


<p>The middle class, and particularly students, do
not have a stable social basis in society as do the bourgeoisie
and the proletariat. They are squeezed between the mighty
antagonists in class society and swing between the opposite class
poles.</p>


<p>In the rarified atmosphere of the universities
all sorts of sects can get a hearing. The students they influence
usually drop out of politics soon after leaving the isolated
cloisters of the universities, when the huge gap between the
ideas they have accepted and the reality of life become apparent.</p>


<p>But many layers of worthwhile students, school
students and, in particular, students in the colleges of further
education from working class origin, can be won to the standpoint
and ideology of the working class.</p>


<p>Throughout history, in all countries, the youth
have been the backbone of the revolutionary movement in its early
stages of development. This is just as true in relation to the
movement in Britain. When convinced of ideas, young people will
apply enormous energy, enthusiasm and sacrifice for the cause.</p>


<h4>The Communist Party</h4>

<p>After 50 years of existence the Communist Party
of Britain (CP) is once again in crisis. Lacking the advantage of
the mass membership and support that the Communist Parties of
Italy and France have, it finds itself in difficulties, similar
to those being experienced by the small Communist Parties of
Western Europe.</p>


<p>Where the masses can discern no fundamental
difference between a mass party and a very much smaller one, they
will tend to support the bigger one. That is a social law of
politics.</p>


<p>In the past the association with the October
revolution was a powerful magnet and a source of strength for the
Communist Party in Britain. That has changed into its opposite.
The abandonment of 'Marxist-Leninist' pretences by the leadership
has reinforced this process. There is not room for two mass
reformist parties in Britain; therefore the reformist
degeneration of the British CP has contributed massively to the
decline of its organisation.</p>


<p>They have the worst of both worlds. They have
the odium of totalitarian policies linked to Moscow and have lost
the dynamism of the past and the revolutionary policies that
constitute the real attraction for the militant minority. As a
consequence there has been a staggering decline in the mass
support of the CP.</p>


<p>At elections, under conditions of mass upsurge,
their vote has fallen below that of nearly half a century ago. In
this parliament they have not dared to put a single candidate
forward in by-elections because they probably would have obtained
an even more derisory vote than the sects.</p>


<p>At a time of disillusionment with the policies
of the Labour government, a genuine revolutionary Communist Party
might have made at least limited gains in mass support and big
gains in the support of the active conscious layer of workers
seeking an alternative to the counter-reformist policies of the
Labour government But far from this, they have declined in
support not only among the masses, but among the trade union and
Labour Party activists.</p>


<p>Only among the students, ironically the former
stamping ground of the ultra-left sects, has the Communist Party
made any sizeable gains. Even in Scotland they have declined,
where for a period they seemed to be holding their ground in the
traditionally red areas of Clydeside and other industrial areas.
Their appeal to youth - the key in the long term - is negligible.
It was not for nothing that Lenin declared that 'he who has the
youth has the future'. The Young Communist League is an
organisation of a few hundred mainly 'paper members'. Without
education, without real cadres, with its leaders as much soaked
in the cynicism and contempt for the working class as their
elders, this organisation has no future as a mass organisation.
It is largely a fictitious organisation propped up by the CP in a
desperate attempt to build a counter-weight to the Labour youth
who have rejected Stalinism.</p>


<p>Among the unions, however - particularly the
key ones of the miners, TGWU, AUEW and other industrial workers'
unions - they have retained powerful positions inherited from the
past. They also have strategic and influential positions in some
engineering factories among the shop stewards.</p>


<p>The organic scepticism and lack of perspectives
of members of the CP is reflected in its degeneration in many
areas into an old peoples' club. It has no attraction for people
looking for a revolutionary way out of their problems. Harold
Wilson's sneer at the lack of social danger to capitalism from
the palsied and sclerotic Communist Party is not very wide of the
mark.</p>


<p>The Stalinists retain all the worst vices of
bureaucratic centralism inherited from the past. The have lost
the former revolutionary faith of their predecessors. At least
the old leadership such as Gallacher, Pollitt and Campbell, had
some real connection with the revolutionary movements of the
workers in the past. The new leaders reek of middle class
respectability. The degeneration of the CP into largely a
petit-bourgeois sect - in outlook and now, to some extent in
membership - is faithfully reflected in the leadership.</p>


<p>The CP leadership has never intended to
institute a real Marxist criticism of the way the Moscow
bureaucracy grew up and carried through a <em>political
counter-revolution </em>against the state set up by Lenin and
Trotsky, or of the fact that, while state ownership and a plan
remain without workers' democracy and control, the state will
continue to be used for the purpose of defending and increasing
the power, privileges, incomes and prestige of the bureaucratic
caste who control the USSR. <em>They will not explain that Russia
remains a grotesque caricature of the ideal of Marx, Lenin and
Trotsky and that it is a monstrously deformed, bureaucratic
Bonapartist workers' state.</em></p>


<p>While they assert their 'independence' from
Moscow in their own mild way, the CP leadership has become
dependent on another pole of attraction - the pole of reformism
which, in the last analysis, reflects the pressures of the
interests of capitalism in a class society.</p>


<p>The reason for the muffled discontent of
industrial workers in the Communist Party with the policies of
their leaders, is that they have become indistinguishable from
the policies of the left union leaders and the left Tribunite
MPs. They wish to ingratiate themselves with 'respectable
society' by showing that they are as 'realistic' and 'down to
earth' as the reformists. This arises from an underlying contempt
for the workers and a disbelief in revolutionary perspectives.</p>


<p>The modern leaders of the CP have never really
studied the works of the great teachers of Marxism, as a
fundamental guide to action, strategy and tactics. They have
busied themselves with little horse-deals and manoeuvres with the
ruling class parties and the reformists. They have miseducated
their members for decades. This has taken its toll on them.</p>


<p>The CP can out-match the reformist leaders in
every way as far as 'putting it across on their own members' is
concerned, but now the chickens are coming home to roost. If
their policy is hardly distinguishable from that of the left
reformists, why should the mass of workers support them,
especially since, in spite of cautious and careful efforts at
presenting themselves as 'independent', their party is tarred
with the same brush as 'totalitarian Russia'.</p>


<p>The lack of a decisive break with Moscow on
Marxist lines condemns the 'liberal' wing of the Communist Party
to sterility. Their organic contempt for theory as a guide (not
as some abstract mysticism) condemns them to oscillate between
left-reformism in their own country and muted criticisms of
Russian Stalinism and a break with their own past and with
Stalinism in Russia.</p>


<p>They have edged away from nationalist Russian
Stalinism, not back to the internationalism of Lenin but to a
vulgar petit-bourgeois nationalism. If they have not yet reached
the depth of reformism reached by the Spanish and Italian
Communist Parties, it is because of their own weakness.</p>


<p>The active sections of the official CP, in the
leadership as well as in many branches, are now dominated by
trendy middle class types. The students and professional people
tend to elbow out the workers and to set the tone in the
attitudes of the Communist Party. Like the sects they take up as
major issues all sorts of incidental by-products of the class
system.</p>


<p>The CP remains a sect. If somewhat smaller than
it was, it is still by far the biggest of the sects.</p>


<h4>Fascism</h4>

<p>The decay of capitalism brings in its train
misery and want for large sections of the population. To the
working and middle class it brings anxieties, worries,
unemployment and privation for many. The inner areas of the big
cities have been left to decay and rot, as has happened in the
strongest capitalist country in the world, the United States.</p>


<p>All the utopias of the reformists, left and
right, of unemployment being a thing of the past, of an
enlightened state looking after the unfortunate victims of a
competitive society, of cities booming, are now shown up for what
they are - mere fictions. The Macmillanite and Churchillite
Tories also disseminated the illusion of a 'never had it so good'
society. Now a Labour government presides over a real slashing of
living standards. So far this year (1977), according to official
figures (which are dolled up with averages), earnings including
overtime etc, have risen by 8.8 per cent while prices (to
September) have risen by 17.8 per cent, which is more than double
the rise in earnings not allowing for taxation.</p>


<p>The social wage has also been slashed. Health,
housing, transport and social services have been cut to the bone,
while in many cities some Labour, as well as Tory councillors,
have grown fat on graft and corruption. In decaying inner city
areas, vandalism among the youth is rife. Football hooliganism is
a symptom of despair amongst the youth who vent their
frustrations by emotional involvement with a certain team.</p>


<p>Petty crime among black and white youth has
leaped to unheard of figures. Youth without jobs and without
amenities are searching for answers to their problems.</p>


<p>For a period, the trade unions supplied no
answer because of the Social Contract.</p>


<p>The black population has tended to be
concentrated in the worst areas of housing and congestion in the
slums of the big cities. They came at a time of great
opportunities for employment etc. Now these are past and there is
competition for even the most menial of jobs.</p>


<p>Many youth, adults and old people are not at
work, where they would become subject to the disciplines of a job
and come under pressure to adopt a trade union outlook involving
solidarity and organisation.</p>


<p>The poorer strata of the population are now
virtual paupers, worse off than pre-war. Labour councils, in
power for decades have merely uprooted many communities and
replaced them with the abomination of high rise flats. The Labour
government seems to have forgotten them. All these factors, and
many more have resulted in the demoralisation of some of the
lower strata of the population.</p>


<p>The middle class too has received short shrift
from both Labour and Tory governments. That is why in Scotland
and to a certain extent in Wales also there has been a resurgence
of long dead nationalism. Scotland and the Strathclyde area in
particular have the worst slums in Europe. This is the climate of
despair in which small shopkeepers, professional people, small
businessmen and farmers react against the remote and 'uncaring'
English bureaucrats and officials in London, pulling behind them
also politically backward layers of white collar workers and even
industrial workers.</p>


<p>There have been Labour governments in Britain
for 16 years, but in every direction people can see only a
worsening of the situation. Nationalism was the penalty the
labour movement paid for the policies of reformism which have
collapsed in ruins.</p>


<p>In England, for similar reasons though on a
smaller scale there has been resurgence of reaction. Rising
prices, lack of jobs, no solution to the housing problems - the
whole gangrenous sickness of capitalism in decay leads to
frustration and anger. For the moment the middle class have swung
back to the Tories.</p>


<p>Many prejudices among the backward layers of
the working class have been inherited from the imperialist past.
Many of the old people have been shaken by the influx of 'aliens'
or black 'foreigners' into their areas. There is an acute
shortage of any sort of accommodation. Unemployment affects the
inner areas of the big cities nearly as much as the 'depressed
regions' of the North East, Wales, Scotland and Merseyside. There
all the problems of capitalism come together in an acute and
aggravated form.</p>


<p>There is frustration too at the apparent
passivity and acceptance of cuts in living standards by the
labour and trade union movement, at the failures of the
'socialism' of the Labour government and the incapacity and
feebleness of the Communist Party.</p>


<p>The large scale immigration of an earlier
period was used in the poisonous slanting of news in the mass
media, planting the idea that immigrants were taking jobs and
housing from the native population, or were living in luxury on
social security payments etc.</p>


<p>All this had its effect on the backward layers
of the population. The black immigrant population was an ideal
target as a scapegoat. It is in this atmosphere that various
virulent groups have sprung up.</p>


<p>As we predicted, the 'high-falutin' fascist
reaction of Mosley was a non-starter. He based himself on the
grandiose dream of being the 'leader of one European nation'
(impossible to create because of the discordant
imperialist-capitalist antagonisms) with the whole of Africa
turned into a slave satellite.</p>


<p>Mosley ingloriously faded away. Fascism
requires not a world utopia but a reactionary <em>nationalist </em>standpoint,
appealing to the prejudices of the backward layers of the
population.</p>


<p>The National Front, stemming partly from the
defunct 'League of Empire Loyalists', bases itself on the gut
prejudices of the criminal lumpen proletariat that infest the
inner areas of big cities like London and Birmingham.</p>


<p>Since the split with Kingsley Reed forming the
National Party, it has taken on many of the attributes of the
open fascist and nazi groupings from which its main leaders, John
Tyndall and Martin Webster came. This association with fascism
will, in the long run, be the kiss of death for the Front.</p>


<p>The lurid campaigns in the press about the tens
of thousands of Ugandan Asians descending after their expulsion
by Amin,<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-6" name="doc-6">(6)</a></sup> came as a tonic to the National Front at a time when
they were in the doldrums. The stoking up of prejudice by the
press prevented the disintegration of the Front at that time.</p>


<p>But it is significant that most of their gains
have come from the demoralised lumpen section of the population
in the inner areas of some of the big towns and cities. These are
areas of high concentration of immigrant populations.</p>


<p>In the East End of London, they have gained
support in the former areas where Mosley was strong - in some
parts of Hackney, Shoreditch, Limehouse and Bethnal Green.</p>


<p>The same types of hawkers, small businessmen
and small shopkeepers looking for some explanation for their
difficulties have fallen for the poison of racialism expressed in
an even viler form since the split: Webster and Tyndall have
adopted the Nazi and Ku Klux Klan definition of an Indian and a
Negro as anyone with a single grandparent of this origin. All are
to be forcibly deported without exception! This repugnant
racialism delights the criminal lumpens who compensate themselves
for their lowly position by regarding themselves as belonging to
a 'superior' race. These are the overtones of open nazism - not
disguised but open racialism.</p>


<p>There is a sprinkling of middle class elements
and even some politically backward workers within their ranks.
But from the point of view of a would-be fascist organisation,
the tactics of the Front have been suicidal for the long-term.</p>


<p>They have attempted to get a basis among the
working class, trying to penetrate areas and constituencies where
the Labour Party and the labour movement are strongest. This will
be a fatal turn for the Front because a fascist movement must
gain its <em>main</em> support from the middle class. With such a
basis it can <em>then </em>draw behind it certain crazed sections
of embittered and backward workers.</p>


<p>Fascism by its very nature must draw its main
forces from the 'frenzied petit-bourgeois, ruined by capitalism'.
This is only possible where the labour movement is paralysed by
its leaders, and fails to show an alternative to the people as a
whole.</p>


<p>In any event the situation has changed
completely since the pre-war years. The ruling class has learned
a sharp lesson in the dangers of losing political control and
handing over the reins of the state to mad demagogues such as
Hitler and Mussolini. They are not predisposed to cede power to
their slavish and lunatic imitators in Britain or any other
country for that matter.</p>


<p>In countries where there has been a
counter-revolution in the post-war period such as Greece and
Chile it is the <em>army and police apparatus </em>which has been
used to establish a military-police Bonapartist dictatorship. It
is true that these have acted in the same way as the fascists,
using them as a model in order to establish a totalitarian state.
They have attempted the complete destruction of the organisations
of the working class and all the democratic rights which go with
them. But they have been far weaker and without a mass basis. The
Greek Colonels' regime<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-7" name="doc-7">(7)</a></sup> collapsed after seven years - a relatively short
period. Probably the Chilean regime will not last much longer,
despite ferocious repression.</p>


<p>The Chilean ruling class used the fascist
'Fatherland and Freedom' party as an <em>auxiliary </em>to the
generals. Their role was one of provocations, bombings,
assassinations and the creation of chaos in the country. <em>They
could never hope to take power on their own. </em>They have played
no significant or any independent role since the assumption of
power by the Generals' junta.</p>


<p>In Italy the neo-fascists have tried to play
the same role. They did not dare to aspire to seize power for
themselves. The working class, through its organisations - trade
unions and workers' parties - was too strong for them to be able
to do so.</p>


<p>They have played the role of <em>jackal </em>to
the military, trying to provoke the army to take power by
creating an atmosphere of lawlessness and chaos with bombings and
assassinations. They have attacked trade unions and workers'
political demonstrations and headquarters with bombs, blown up
banks and business premises etc, all to give the impression of an
anarchic breakdown of society.</p>


<p>All these activities over a period of years
(over a decade or so) were carried out in collusion with the
Christian Democratic Ministers of Interior and Justice, and with
the heads of police, Military Intelligence and the Special
Branch.</p>


<p><em>The neo-fascists were merely an auxiliary of
the state to carry out the dirty work for capitalism in a society
undergoing crisis.</em></p>


<p>This is entirely different to the position with
Mussolini and his fascists. He burned, assassinated and butchered
his way to gain support for fascism from among the
petit-bourgeois and prepare his own coup with a mass force behind
him. This was also the position with Hitler. The forces of the
state were placed at his disposal once he had won the big
majority of the maddened middle class.</p>


<p>In Italy, at the prompting of the CIA, the
bourgeoisie and the state machine braced themselves for a seizure
of power by the military, with the fascist thugs as an auxiliary.
At the last moment they hesitated and abandoned the project.</p>


<p>The reason was their fear of the inevitable
reaction from the powerful proletariat. <em>It would lead to a
civil war, </em>which they were not certain they would win. A coup
of the military would have provoked a situation like that of July
1936 in Spain.</p>


<p>So the capitalist rulers are not prepared to
risk this kind of action until there is absolutely no other way
out and they are forced to put their whole existence at stake.
Consequently they have largely dispensed with the service of the
neo-fascists - at least for the time being. The latter have
anyway split in two and are now completely ineffective.</p>


<p>Thus we see that <em>it is wrong to draw lessons
from the past in the way the sects do - expecting every detail to
be repeated in exactly the same way. </em>The only time they use
the writings of Lenin and Trotsky they misuse them because of
their lack of understanding of Marxist method.</p>


<p>This method takes all social processes in the
interaction on the classes in society, the strength and the
relation of forces, the international environment, balance of
classes and so on. The enormous preponderance of the working
class as a social force, the fact that it is the overwhelming
majority in all the main countries of industrialised capitalism
must be weighed against the shrinking numbers, strength and
cohesion of the various strata of the middle class. Their
combative power is shrinking when opposed to that of the working
class. </p>


<p>Of course, it is possible for individuals and
even small politically backward groups infected with racialist
ideas to support the National Front. Some will even join. But
they can only be attracted in any numbers by a dynamic mass
movement of fascism - even then they will be mainly unemployed
and absolutely demoralised workers. This kind of development can
only come after <em>some decisive defeats </em>of the workers. Not
only one, but under modern conditions there would have to be a
few. Yet there has been no great defeat for the proletariat in
decades.</p>


<p>Despite unemployment, the trade unions are
growing in numbers and strength! The position of the proletariat
is one of unprecedented power, despite the recent paralysis
caused by the Social Contract and the disillusionment with the
measures of the Labour government.</p>


<p>The Marxists must publicise the dangers of
fascist reaction and attacks on Labour Party premises and
meetings. The attempts to burn down various left wing bookshops
and premises underline the danger these scum represent to the
labour movement even at the present time.</p>


<p>The movement and the working class must be
educated to the danger these organisations, however small,
represent to the rights of workers.</p>


<p>Supporters of Marxism will never tire of
pointing out that the real aim of these organisations is to
atomise <em>the working class </em>and render it helpless in the
face of the ravages of the capitalists.</p>


<p>Their programme is the complete destruction of
the trade unions and the Labour Party, to take away from the
workers all their democratic rights - the right to organise, the
right to strike, the right of assembly, free speech and a free
press and even the democratic rights of elections and the right
to vote freely for candidates of their own choice. That is, the
fascists aim to destroy the elements of a new society that exist
in the labour and trade union movement. They would stop at
nothing to prevent the possibility of an overthrow of capitalism,
using the savage methods of concentration camps, police and
military terror etc.</p>


<p>Marxist supporters must expose these views but
they must have a sense of proportion as Marxists did in the
post-war struggle against the Mosleyites. As we predicted, the
latter have largely disappeared as an organised force. The
esoteric doctrines of their leader had no appeal to plain
reactionary petit-bourgeoisie.</p>


<p>The real menace of fascism, perhaps in the not
too distant future will probably come from the reactionary wing
of the Tory Party. The howls over the closed shop and the bayings
for action embodied in resolutions from the Tory constituency
parties, are indications of upper middle class and middle class
reaction.</p>


<p>Under conditions of a protracted economic
decline, with the social storms which would face a Tory or
National government, the right wing Tories, plus so-called
'liberal' Tories in groupings like the Tory Reform Group, plus a
section of ex-Labour Party right wing reformists, would reveal
increasing discontent. They would demand drastic action against
the unions, 'those Bolsheviks and extremists', with their
'unreasonable' and 'intolerable pressures', 'throwing their
weight about' etc.</p>


<p>The elements that form the Monday Club are the
types that would hive off to the right and form the core of a new
organisation. Besides union-bashing, they would also engage in
social demagogy. Like the Monday Club, such an organisation's
racialism would be overt - 'stop all coloured immigration', 'send
back all illegal immigrants and black criminals and muggers'. The
poison would be there without the crude nazi-like ravings and
outpourings of the National Front.</p>


<p>If there were a <em>big majority </em>National or
Tory government the right wing would move increasingly into
opposition over the lack of measures against the workers'
organisations. Under heated conditions, an early split would be
possible. More likely a split from the Tories would take place
under a new Labour government, particularly if it were a left
wing one, and the Tory Party were incapable of effective
opposition.</p>


<p>Such a right wing party would try to organise
the small shopkeepers, the small business people, professionals,
technicians, managers, staff, white-collar workers and
politically backward workers, lumpens and criminals into some
sort of force.</p>


<p><em>But we have to emphasise that it would only
be the failure of the labour movement to transform society which
would bring about this punishment. </em>It would be the penalty to
be paid for temporising over drastic measures against capitalism
which could result in a further recoil of the middle class from
the 'crime' of reformism, just as nationalism in Scotland, and
partly in Wales is the consequence of local and national
incompetence by the reformists.</p>


<p>But with the rise of a mass movement, as
workers, the Labour Party and trade unions move into action with
demonstrations and strikes and other means of struggle, the
advanced workers will draw behind them the big majority of the
more politically backward layers. The National Front has only
gained because of the passivity and inaction of the labour
movement during the last two or three years.</p>


<p>Once the movement goes into action the Front
will be left stranded. Feuding amongst the fuehrers and
ego-maniacs who compose its leaders will break out again as
support ebbs. The National Front will have new splits as they
will be incapable of explaining or understanding what will be
happening with the movement of the working class.</p>


<p>Like the sects they live in the past without
understanding the specific conditions which led to the victory of
fascists in Italy, Germany and Spain. They will be like a
poisonous insect which irritates a giant who moves to crush it
because it stings. Recently, when the North West TUC moved -
threatening to bring 20,000 workers into action, distributing 2
million leaflets etc, the authorities were compelled reluctantly
to take action and ban the National Front march in Tameside. </p>


<p>Nevertheless the opportunity should be taken by
Marxists to explain the deadly effects of racialism, the evils of
capitalism and the loathsome, evil and malignant cancer of
fascism and of the National Front itself.</p>


<p>The dialectics of class relations are like a
book sealed with seven seals to the 'gentlemen' of the sects. The
'old cart horse' of the TUC, under the flick of the whip of
reaction, would flex its muscles and the working class would show
its strength.</p>


<p>By involving the mighty Labour Party and trade
unions in the struggles against fascism and racialism, typified
by the activities of the National Front, Marxists can raise the
level of understanding of the working class as a whole to the
need to change society.</p>
