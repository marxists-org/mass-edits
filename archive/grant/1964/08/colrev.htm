<p class="fst">The Second World War ended with a revolutionary
wave in Western Europe which, thanks to the aid of Stalinism and
social democracy, capitalism survived. Stalinism in the Soviet
Union, temporarily for a whole historical period, emerged strengthened.</p>


<p>In the history of society there have been many
methods of class rule. This is especially true of capitalist
society, with many peculiar and variegated forms: republic,
monarchy, fascism, democracy, Bonapartist, centralised and
federal, to give some examples.</p>


<p>In a period where the revolution (apart from
Czechoslovakia) has taken place in backward or undeveloped
countries, distortions, even monstrous distortions in the nature
of the state created by the revolution are inevitable, so long as
the most vital industrialised areas of the world remain under the
control of capital.</p>


<p>A decisive cause of the developments is the
Bonapartist counter-revolution in the Soviet Union. The malignant
power of the state and the uncontrolled rule of the privileged
layers in the Soviet Union have served as a model for &#8220;socialism&#8221;
in these countries. Bourgeois Bonapartism reflects a society in a
state of crisis, where the state raises itself above society and
the classes and obtains a relatively independent role, only in
the last analysis directly reflecting the propertied classes,
because of the defence of private property on which it is based.</p>


<p>The proletariat is not a &#8220;sacred cow&#8221; to which
analogous processes cannot take place. Proletarian Bonapartism
represents a most peculiar form of workers&#8217; rule. Contradictions
in a largely backward society in which the proletariat represents
a small minority, as Lenin pointed out, can lead to the
dictatorship manifesting itself through the rule of one man.</p>


<p>A proletarian form of Bonapartism by its very
nature represents a caricature of workers&#8217; rule. In a society
where private ownership has been abolished and there is no
democracy, the powers of the state gain enormous extension. The
state raises itself above society and becomes a tool of the
bureaucracy in its various forms: military, police, party, &#8220;trade
union&#8221; and managerial. These are the privileged strata within the
society. They are the sole commanding stratum. In the transition
from capitalist society to socialism the form of economy can only
be state ownership of the means of production, with the
organisation of production on the basis of a plan. Only the
democratic control of the workers and peasants can guarantee such
a transition. That is why political revolution in these countries
is inevitable before workers&#8217; democracy is instituted as an
indispensable necessity if the state is to &#8220;wither away&#8221;, but
such &#8220;transition regimes&#8221; can only be workers&#8217; states&mdash;deformed
workers&#8217; states&mdash;because the economy of these states is based on
nationalisation of the means of production, the operation of the
economy on the basis of a plan.</p>


<p>Marx never considered the problem of revolution
in backward countries as he considered the revolution would come
in the advanced capitalist countries first. These Bonapartist
regimes&mdash;regimes of crisis&mdash;reflect the unresolved economic and
social problems, both on the narrow national plane and
internationally&mdash;crises which can only be resolved by world
revolution, especially in the advanced countries.</p>


<p>The development of the Chinese revolution, next
to the Russian revolution the &#8220;greatest event in human history&#8221;
as the documents of the Revolutionary Communist Party proclaimed
in advance, took place with a mighty deformed workers&#8217; state at
its back, plus the frustration of the revolutionary tide in the
West. Without the existence of the monstrously deformed workers&#8217;
state in the East, and the paralysing of the hands of imperialism
by the radicalisation of the workers in the West, the Chinese
revolution could not have taken the form which it did.</p>

<!-- begin not in TUT -->
<p>The Chinese revolution unfolded as a peasant war (see documents where this is developed) led by ex-Marxists. Thus as in Eastern Europe the revolution from the beginning assumed a Bonapartist character, with the classical instruments of Bonapartism, the peasant army. It was the complete incapacity of the Chinese bourgeoisie to solve a single one of the tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, which resulted in the revolution taking the form which it did.</p>
<!-- end not in TUT -->

<p>Trotsky in the pre-war period had posed the
problem of what would happen in the case of the Chinese &#8220;Red&#8221;
Armies emerging victorious in the civil war against Chiang
Kai-Shek. He had tentatively forecast that the tops of the Red
Army would betray their peasant base, and in the cities, with the
passivity of the proletariat, would fuse with the bourgeoisie,
leading to a classical capitalist development.</p>


<p>This did not take place because on the road of
capitalist development there was no way forward for China. With
the model of Russia, the Stalinist leadership of the peasant
armies manoeuvred between the classes, at one time resting on the
&#8220;national&#8221; bourgeoisie, or the peasants, and at others on the
working class and constructed a strong Stalinist leadership in
the image of Moscow. At no time was there a period of workers&#8217;
rule such as in Russia in 1917, when the workers through their
Soviets controlled the state and society.</p>


<p>Just as bourgeois Bonapartism, manoeuvring
between the classes, <!-- begin not in TUT -->nevertheless<!-- end not in TUT --> in the last analysis, defends the basis of
capitalist society, so in the same way proletarian Bonapartism
rests in the last analysis on the base created by the revolution:
the nationalised economy.</p>


<p>The Chinese revolution solved all those
problems which bourgeois society was incapable of solving. The
three decades of rule by Chiang Kai-Shek, the Bonapartist
representative of finance capital, revealed the complete
incapacity of the bourgeoisie to unify China, to carry through
the agrarian revolution, to overthrow imperialism. It could only
usher in a new period of decay for Chinese society. It was this
which gave the impulse to the leadership of the peasant armies to
overthrow the bourgeoisie and, thanks to the model of Russia at
her back, construct a state on the Stalinist model.</p>


<p>The leadership was without international or
Marxist perspectives. The conscious role and leadership of the
proletariat, without which socialism is impossible, was absent.
The Stalinist leadership, in the conquest of the cities, used the
passivity of the proletariat, and where elements of proletarian
action emerged spontaneously, met these with the execution of the
leading participants.</p>


<p>However, the welding of the atomised and
separate provinces into a single unified national state on modern
lines, for the first time in the history of China; the agrarian
revolution; the nationalisation of the means of production: all
these gave a mighty impulse to the development of the productive
forces. China advanced as no colonial economy has advanced for
decades.</p>


<p>The Chinese bureaucracy, like all bureaucracies
of a similar character, is interested mainly in advancing its own
power, privileges, income and prestige. It defends the base of
nationalised property on which it rests, because this is the
basis of its income and power.</p>


<p>As predicted in advance, before the Chinese
bureaucracy came to power, the possibility of a conflict between
it and the Russian bureaucracy, was inherent in the situation.
The attempt of the Russian bureaucracy to arrive at an agreement
with American imperialism, without giving consideration to the
needs and interests of the Chinese bureaucracy, precipitated the
split between the two tendencies.</p>


<p>The rationalisation of the split by
&#8220;ideological&#8221; considerations was a means to try and gain support
within the Communist Parties, on a world scale. The Chinese, for
the moment, have used radical slogans as a means of mobilising
support in the Stalinist world movement against the Russians,
especially among the colonial peoples. Their open support of
Stalin, repelling the workers in the Soviet Union and the West,
among other calculations, is intended to draw a line of blood and
confusion between the Communist workers looking for a Marxist
solution, and &#8220;Trotskyism&#8221;, ie genuine Marxism-Leninism.</p>


<p>Because of their radical slogans, at this time,
the Chinese appeal to the cadre elements in the Stalinist parties
looking for a revolutionary road. In that sense, every nuance,
every cranny, must be utilised by the Marxist tendency for the
purpose of finding a way to the sincere Stalinist workers.</p>


<p>The real face of Chinese Stalinism is revealed
in the opportunism of the leadership in the colonial world, where
they have given support to the rotting, feudal, bourgeois upper
strata in many countries. The support of the Imam in the Yemen,
the loans to Afghanistan, to Sri Lanka, to Pakistan, support of
Sukarno in Indonesia, etc. Without being able to compete in
resources, they have used the slender means of the Chinese
economy in competition with the Russian bureaucracy and with
imperialism. Their ideology, their conceptions, cannot rise above
the narrow national interests of the Chinese bureaucracy.</p>


<p>Their &#8220;internationalism&#8221; consists in trying to
build an instrument of support similar to that possessed by the
Russian Stalinist bureaucracy. Their ideology, methods and
attitudes are a counterfeit of Marxism, as much as that of the
Russian bureaucracy, at various stages of its development.</p>


<p>The idealisation of Stalinism in its crudest
and most repressive form, is for the above-mentioned reason of
the need to prevent any tendency of the militant workers to drift
towards &#8220;Trotskyism&#8221; and because of the nature of the Chinese
economy. Like the Russian before it, such a regime, on the basis
of the Chinese economy alone, may endure for decades, with its
slender base in industry, in comparison with the hundreds of
millions of peasants. Only the socialist revolution in the West,
or the political revolution in the Soviet Union, could alter this
perspective.</p>


<p>The viciousness with which the bureaucracy of
the Soviet Union supported India in the conflict with China,
withdrew their technicians and destroyed plans and blueprints in
their endeavours to weaken China, is an indication of the real
character of the bureaucracy in the Soviet Union. They have been
ready to lavish loans and aid on the bourgeoisie and parasitic
upper layers of the colonial countries, in order to prop up these
regimes in competition with imperialism. But to the bureaucracy
of another workers&#8217; state coming into conflict with them, they
demonstrated their selfish national aims.</p>


<p>Similarly, China&mdash;as with the diplomatic
agreement with Pakistan and the tour of Prime Minister Chou En
Lai, in Africa&mdash;apes the Russian bureaucracy in its endeavour to
find friends. In Zanzibar they came to an agreement with the
Sultan, before he was overthrown; they made no criticism of the
governments of Tanganyika, Uganda and Kenya for calling British
troops against their own mutinous troops.</p>


<p>The Chinese Stalinists, not accidentally,
advised the Algerians to &#8220;go slow&#8221; with their revolution. This
was because of the forthcoming diplomatic agreement with French
imperialism. The basic perspectives of Chinese Stalinism are
determined by their national aims of obtaining a seat in the
United Nations, and for strengthening the Chinese national state
through whatever means possible, agreement with imperialism for
trade etc. They have attempted to mobilise the Afro-Asian bloc
with this in mind and not at all with the international
perspectives of socialism and the social revolution.</p>


<p>The split between Russia and China, as with the
split between Yugoslavia and Russia and now the development of
new national Stalinism in the countries of Eastern Europe,
Poland, Rumania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, etc., is a symptom of
Stalinist decay and, simultaneously, of the weakness of the
revolutionary forces of Marxism on a world scale at the present
time. Had there been in existence mighty Marxist revolutionary
forces of the proletariat, consciously preparing the revolution
in the industrially advanced countries of the world, such a
phenomenon would have been impossible. As at the time of the
Hungarian political revolution of 1956, before which the
bureaucracies of these countries trembled and drew together for
mutual protection and support, the Chinese bureaucracy would not
have dared to launch the campaign against Russian &#8220;revisionism&#8221;.
All these bureaucracies would have been facing collapse and
overthrow.</p>


<p>The split between the Stalinist bureaucracies
on national lines adds further confusion among the broad masses
throughout the world. Even among the advanced workers, while
creating certain opportunities for the ideas of Marxism, it
further complicates the task of revolutionary Marxism. However,
in the long term, it undermines completely the former monolithism
of Stalinism and its hold on the masses. The way is prepared for,
on the basis of great events, tens and hundreds of thousands of
workers to enter the revolutionary road. In the next great
upheavals, both East and West, of social and political
revolutions, Stalinism will crumble away.</p>


<p>Nevertheless, one of the basic tasks of the
period is the education of the most conscious workers not to be
infected by any of the variants of Stalinism. There is as great a
gulf between Stalinism in its various forms, both of state and
ideology and real workers&#8217; democracy and Marxism as there is
between Bonapartism, fascism and bourgeois democratic state and
ideology.</p>


<p>While defending the progressive aspects of the
economy in Russia, China, Cuba and Eastern Europe, at the same
time it is necessary to draw a fundamental distinction between
the rotten nationalist bureaucratic ideology of Stalinism and its
states, and the conscious control of the economy and of the
movement towards socialism of the working class as explained in
the methods and conceptions of international socialism.</p>

<h4>The Colonial Revolution in Asia, Africa and Latin America</h4>
<!-- end not in TUT -->

<p>Following the failure of the post-war
revolutionary wave in the West, capitalism succeeded in
stabilising itself for an entire epoch. Consequences became
cause. A new period of capitalist growth was ushered in for all
the metropolitan countries, of greater or lesser strength. The
increasing power of the Soviet Union with its far faster tempo of
industrial growth, together with the growth of the workers&#8217;
states and the stabilisation of a mighty China, resulted in a new
balance of forces on a world scale between the capitalist forces
of the West and the workers&#8217; states of the East.</p>


<p>This is the background on which, in one country
after the other, there has been the continual upheaval of
national upsurge and revolution against imperialist domination
and national oppression. At a time of rapid growth of productive
forces in the metropolitan countries the gap between the
industrially developed countries and the so-called &#8220;undeveloped&#8221;
areas of the world has become twice as great as before the Second
World War. The growth of industry on a modest scale in these
latter countries has exacerbated the social contradictions.</p>


<p>In all these countries, the problems of the
national revolution, the agrarian revolution, the liquidation of
feudal and pre-feudal survivals, could not be solved on the old
basis. This has been the period of national awakening of the
oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America.</p>


<p>Faced with this upsurge of the colonial masses,
the imperialists have been compelled to retreat. A century ago,
Marx explained that only the lack of national consciousness among
the peasant masses allowed the imperialists to conquer and
dominate the East and Africa. Once they were aroused, it was
practically impossible to hold a whole nation in chains. Trotsky
in the year prior to the Second World War, had observed that the
task of &#8220;pacification&#8221; of the colonial revolts had become far
more expensive than the fruits of the exploitation of the
colonies. And this in a period when colonial uprisings were at an
early stage.</p>


<p>Already in 1945, Britain had drawn the
conclusion from the revolt of the Indian people, of the necessity
to arrive at some sort of compromise with the Indian bourgeoisie
and landlords. Partly this was due to the impossibility, because
of the radical mood of the soldiers of Allied imperialism and of
the working class in Britain, of waging a large scale war of
conquest or re-conquest of India and partly for fear of the
upsurge of the Indian people.</p>


<p>French and Dutch imperialism had to learn the
lessons after the squandering of blood and treasure in Indonesia,
Indo-China, Algeria, etc. The Bourbons<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup>
of Portugal are in the process of learning the lesson at the present time.</p>


<p>Thus the lag of the revolution in Europe and
other metropolitan countries has pushed the revolution to the
extremities of the capitalist world, to the weakest links in the
chain of capitalism. However, the development of Stalinism in
Russia and its extension to China and Eastern Europe, the
frustration of the revolution in the industrially decisive areas
of the capitalist world, has meant that <em>the development of the
permanent revolution in these underdeveloped countries has taken
a distorted pattern. </em>The degeneration of the Russian
revolution, the Bonapartist form of the Chinese revolution, in
spite of its splendours, has meant in its turn that the
revolution in the colonial countries begins with nationally
limited perspectives and with fundamental deformations from the
very beginning.</p>


<p>The revolution in Russia, which began as a
bourgeois-democratic revolution, ended in a proletarian
revolution of the most classic proportions, with the dominating
role of the proletariat as the main decisive force of the
revolution. It culminated in the October insurrection of the <em>working
class, </em>which throughout was based on internationalist and
Marxist perspectives. The Chinese peasant revolt, which
culminated in the peasant war of 1944-9, was in a sense derived
from the defeated revolution of 1925-7, but entirely different
from it in the role of the working class. It was a <em>peasant war</em>
carried out first as a guerrilla war, and culminating in the
conquest of the cities by the armies of the peasants.</p>


<p>The socialist revolution, in contrast with all
previous revolutions, requires the conscious participation and
control of the working class. Without it, there can be no
revolution leading to the dictatorship of the proletariat as
understood by Marx and Lenin, nor can there be a transition in
the direction of socialism.</p>


<p>A revolution in which the prime force is the
peasantry cannot rise to the height of the tasks posed by
history. The peasantry cannot play an independent role; either
they support the bourgeoisie or the proletariat. Where the
proletariat is not playing a leading part in the revolution, the
peasant army, with the impasse of bourgeois society, can be used,
especially with the existence of ready-made models, for the
expropriation of bourgeois society in the Bonapartist manoeuvring
between classes and the construction of a state on the model of
Stalinist Russia.</p>


<p>The bourgeoisie of the colonial areas has come
too late on the world arena to be enabled to play the progressive
role which the Western bourgeoisie played in the development of
capitalist society. They are too weak, their resources are too
narrow to hope to compete with the industrial economies of the
capitalist West. The disparity between the weak and
underdeveloped economies of the colonial world and the
metropolitan areas, far from being ameliorated, is gathering
speed. It has been further emphasised during the last two decades
by the upswing of capitalist economy in the metropolitan areas.
Whereas in the capitalist economy in the West, the standard of
living of the masses has increased in absolute terms, even though
the rate of exploitation has increased, there has been an
absolute decline in living standards in the East. By the peculiar
dialectic of the revolution, the colonial revolution itself has actually
helped the economies of the metropolitan countries by creating a
market for capital goods.</p>


<p>The imperialists, except for the Portuguese,
were forced to abandon the old method of direct military
domination in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Economic
domination with nominally independent states became the norm.</p>


<p>The <span class="inote">[period since the]</span> Second World War has seen
unprecedented upheavals in the colonial areas. The period of
national awakening of all oppressed peoples has been on a scale
and in a measure that military means are doomed to failure, as
evidenced by the British in even such as small island as Cyprus,
the French in Algeria, and tomorrow the collapse of the attempt
to pacify Angola.</p>


<p>All these revolutions and national awakenings
have taken place with a lag and delay of the revolution in the
West. However, the greatest force for change in society, which
must always be regarded from an internationalist perspective,
still lies in the decisive areas of Western Europe, Britain,
Japan and the United States in the capitalist world, and Russia
and Eastern Europe in the deformed workers&#8217; states. From the
point of view of the change from one society to another, while of
fundamental importance to revolutionaries involved in the actual
struggle, a decade or two in the development of society is of
secondary significance. The very growth of the capitalist world,
the very development of the economy in the underdeveloped areas
of the world, are all drawing together the threads of change on a
world scale. In the endeavour to compete with the advancing
economies of the Stalinist countries, capitalism has been
compelled to use up a great part of its social reserves. Direct
domination and colonial tribute as a consequence of a military
overlordship, have disappeared or are in the process of
disappearing.</p>


<p>Economic domination and the crushing
preponderance of the metropolitan economies over the frail
economies of the colonial or ex-colonial states is even greater
and further increasing than in the past. At the same time, in the
metropolitan countries themselves, the very <!-- begin not in TUT -->growth of the productive apparatus has led to a situation where the social reserves of the ruling class are becoming narrowed. The<!-- end not in TUT --> growth of monopoly, the growth of industry, the industrialisation of agriculture,
have all led to the contraction of the peasantry and the
petit-bourgeoisie and a further increase in the decisive weight
in society of the proletariat.</p>


<p>From the point of view of Marxism, no more
favourable situation could be envisaged. The potential power of
the proletariat in both the deformed workers&#8217; states on the one
side, and the capitalist countries on the other, has never
reached a greater scope than in the present epoch. From this
point of view, a tremendously optimistic perspective opens out
for the future. The tremendous upsurge of productive forces will
inevitably reach its end and result in a new period of paralysis
and decay, such as the inter-war period, in the capitalist
countries. In the Soviet Union and the East, the further
development of productive forces will come increasingly into
collision with the stranglehold of bureaucratic control. The
bureaucracy will become more and more incompatible with the
development of society. A new period of social revolution in the
West and of political revolution in the East will be opened out.</p>


<p>It is on this background and with this
perspective constantly in mind that the colonial revolution in
Asia, Africa and Latin America must be regarded. Had Russia been
a healthy workers&#8217; state, or even a state with the relatively
mild deformations of the era of Lenin and Trotsky, then
undoubtedly the revolution in all backward countries would most
likely have taken a different form. As Lenin had optimistically
declared with the first wave of revolutionary awakening in the
backward countries of the world, it would have been possible for
even tribal areas of Africa to &#8220;go straight to communism&#8221; without
any intervening period whatsoever. This could only have been, of
course, on the basis of <!-- begin not in TUT -->the integration of the economies of these countries with that of the mightily developed Soviet Union, on the basis of <!-- end not in TUT -->a genuine and fraternal federation, for
the benefit of all. Of course, in any event, the problem would
have been posed entirely differently; a healthy workers&#8217; state in
Russia would have led to the victory of the revolution in Europe
and the industrially advanced countries of the world, thus posing
the problem for undeveloped areas in an entirely different way.
That was the scheme of Marx, who had thought that with the
accomplishment of the revolution in Britain, France and Germany,
the rest of the world (with the crushing industrial preponderance
of these areas at the time) would have been compelled to follow
willy nilly.</p>


<p>The explanation for the way in which the
revolution is developing in the colonial countries lies in the
delay and over-ripeness of the revolution in the West, on the one
side, and the deformation of the revolution in Russia and China
on the other side. At the same time, it is impossible to continue
on the old lines and old pattern of social relations. If, from an
historical view, the bourgeoisie has exhausted its social role in
the metropolitan capitalist countries, in the present stage of
world society, it is even more incapable of rising to the tasks
posed by history in the colonial areas of the world.</p>


<p>The rotten bourgeoisie of the East and the
nascent bourgeoisie of Africa are quite incapable of rising to
the tasks solved long ago by the bourgeoisie in the West.
Meanwhile the bourgeois-democratic and national revolution in the
colonial areas cannot be stayed. The rise in national
consciousness in all these areas imperatively demands a solution
to the tasks posed by the pressure of the more developed
countries of the West.</p>


<p>The decay of world imperialism and the rise of
two mighty Stalinist states, of Russia in Europe and China in
Asia, has resulted in a peculiar balance of world forces. The
bourgeoisie and to a certain extent the national
petit-bourgeoisie and upper layers of colonial society, was
allowed a role which would have been impossible without the world
relationship of forces which emerged as a result of the Second
World War. Even the heightened role which the Afro-Asian bloc
plays in the United Nations (albeit on secondary questions&mdash;they
cannot play the same role when it comes to a fundamental issue)
is an indication of this change. The competition between the West
and Russia&mdash;and now China, Russia and the West&mdash;for the aid and
support of the ruling circles in Africa and Latin America and
Asia, is an indication of the result of this precarious balance
of forces.</p>


<p>The degeneration of the Russian Revolution and
the strengthening of Stalinism for a whole historical epoch was
the main reason why the revolution in China began right from the
start on Bonapartist lines. This in its turn has meant that <em>the
revolution in other countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America
had a ready-made Bonapartist model </em>- which is associated in
the minds of the leading circles of the intellectual strata as
&#8220;socialism&#8221;. Whilst the Chinese revolution was accomplished
largely through a peasant war, and a peasant army as an
instrument of proletarian Bonapartism, at least lip service was
given in the later stages of the revolution, after the conquest
of power, to the rule of the proletariat. This was the case in
Cuba also, where the peasant army and the guerrilla war played
the dominant role in the revolution, until the uprising of the
proletariat in Havana. After the transformation of the
bourgeois-democratic revolution under Castro&#8217;s leadership into a
state on the model of Yugoslavia, China and Russia, also a
dominant role of the proletariat was conceded, but again in
words.</p>


<p>All history has demonstrated that the peasantry
by its very nature as a class, can never play the dominant role
in society. It can support either the proletariat or the
bourgeoisie. Under modern conditions, it can also support the
proletarian Bonapartist leaders or ex-leaders of the proletariat.
However, <em>in doing so, a distortion of the revolution is
inevitable. </em>A distortion in one form or another on the lines
of a military-police state.</p>


<p>Every Marxist who claims to base themselves on
the scientific theory of Marx and Engels, with its deepening and
extension in the ideas of Lenin and Trotsky, has explained the
necessary role of the proletariat&mdash;and in the role of the
proletariat of socialist consciousness&mdash;as the driving force of
the changeover from capitalism into the new society. Without
socialist consciousness, there can be no socialist revolution and
no transition of society to socialism. Marxists like Lenin and
Trotsky have not emphasised the role of socialist consciousness
and the conscious participation of the proletariat in the course
of the socialist revolution in the overthrow of the old society
for idealist or sentimental reasons. They did so because without
the participation of the proletariat in the socialist revolution
(in the West, the success of such a revolution is impossible
without the mobilisation of all the forces of the proletariat)
and its conscious control and organisation of the transitional
society, a development towards socialism is absolutely
impossible.</p>


<p>There is no automatism of the productive forces
without the control <span class="inote">[by the workers of the state]</span>&mdash;even in a highly
industrialised state like Britain or America, the very existence
of a state would be a capitalist survival from the past. Without
conscious control on the part of the proletariat, whose
dictatorship is intended to speedily dissolve all elements of
state coercion into society, the state as evidenced in Russia and
China, inevitably gains an impetus and a movement of its own.</p>


<p>If in China the bourgeoisie revealed its utter
incapacity to solve a single one of the tasks of the
bourgeois-democratic revolution, events will demonstrate the even
greater incapacity of the Indian, still less of the other Asian
and African, bourgeois elements to solve a single one of the
problems posed in front of these countries by history.</p>


<p>It is the incapacity of the bourgeois,
semi-bourgeois, upper middle class, landlords and petit-bourgeois
to solve these tasks, that poses the problem of the permanent
revolution in a distorted way. Had there been in existence strong
Marxist parties and tendencies in the colonial areas of the
world, the problem of power would have been posed somewhat
differently. It would have been posed with an internationalist
perspective. <!-- begin not in TUT -->But even then a prolonged isolation could only have had the same effect as in Russia and China. <!-- end not in TUT -->Even more than in the industrially developed
countries of the West, socialism in one country, or, one might
add, in a series of backward countries, is an impossible chimera.
Nevertheless, the tasks of development in these countries are
imperiously posed. With the world balance of forces, with the
delay of the revolution in the West, with the lack of Marxist
parties in these countries and with the <!-- begin not in TUT -->balance of social forces between West and East, between imperialism and these countries, and with the <!-- end not in TUT -->social classes in these
countries themselves, new and peculiar phenomena are inevitable.</p>


<p>For example, with a mighty Chinese revolution
on its borders, developments in Burma have taken a peculiar form.
Since the end of the War Burmese society has been disorganised.
The national minorities have waged a constant struggle for
self-determination and national autonomy in their own states
(Kachins, Shans, etc.) and at the same time, different factions of
the Stalinist party have waged a terrific guerrilla war. One
government has succeeded another, but each has been incapable of<!-- begin not in TUT --> solving the problems of Burmese society. The weak bourgeoisie has been incapable of <!-- end not in TUT -->
putting its stamp on society. Like the Chinese bourgeoisie before
it, it has been incapable of unifying society, giving it social
cohesion and satisfying the land hunger of the peasants, or
breaking the economic power of imperialism. It is a striking
symptom of the new developments in these backward countries that
all the factions in Burma claim to be &#8220;socialist&#8221;. Imperialism
dominated the economy, by its ownership, largely, of whatever
industry existed and <span class="inote">[of]</span> the main economic forces such as teak
plantations, oil and transport.</p>


<p>With the example of China on the border, it
became more and more apparent to the upper layers of the
petit-bourgeois that on the road of bourgeois society there was
no way forward for Burma. As in China, in the decades before the
revolution, the bourgeoisie was incapable of bringing the guerrilla
war to an end and ensuring the development of a stable society
and the inauguration of industrialisation and the creation of a
modern state.</p>


<p>Each succeeding government made only the
feeblest attempts to try and develop the economy. The weakness of
imperialism, the balance of forces nationally and
internationally, led to a situation where the officer caste posed
the problem before itself of finding some stability within
society. In all these countries, the development of the bourgeois
revolution, a bourgeois democratic state, and a development
towards a modern bourgeois democracy, given the existing
relationship of class and national forces and with the pressure
of the world economy, <!-- begin not in TUT -->at any rate<!-- end not in TUT --> for any lengthy period is impossible.</p>


<p>Consequently, some form of Bonapartism, some
form of military-police state, was inevitable in Burma. The
<!-- begin not in TUT -->army<!-- end not in TUT --> officer caste saw itself in the role of the only strata which
could &#8220;save&#8221; society from disintegration and collapse, as the
feeble bourgeoisie obviously offered no solution. Consequently,
the officer caste which had participated as one of the
&#8220;socialist&#8221; factions, decided that the only way forward was on
the model of &#8220;socialist&#8221; China, but called a &#8220;Burmese model&#8221; of
&#8220;socialism&#8221;. They have moved rapidly on familiar lines&mdash;a
one-party totalitarian state, and the nationalisation of
foreign-owned interests, including oil, teak, transport etc. <em>They
have begun the expropriation of the indigenous bourgeoisie. </em>They
even threatened the nationalisation of the small shops. <em>They
based themselves on the peasants and the working class. But they
do not have a model of scientific socialism, </em>on the contrary,
their programme is one of &#8220;Burmese-Buddhist socialism&#8221;.</p>


<p>Thus we see the same process at one pace or
another in all the colonial countries. At the moment the process
is becoming marked in the Arab countries, which have been in a
state of ferment for the last decade. In Egypt the revolution
against the incompetent and corrupt Farouk<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup> regime, agency of
imperialism, was led by the officer caste. Over a period, Nasser
<!-- begin not in TUT -->has<!-- end not in TUT --> adopted the policy of &#8220;Arab socialism&#8221;.</p>


<p>The monotony with which such tendencies appear
in all these countries is striking. <!-- begin not in TUT -->Already a great part of the economy of Egypt is nationalised.<!-- end not in TUT --> The Great Aswan Dam, from the
beginning, was owned by the state. <!-- begin not in TUT -->During this year the Nasser regime has nationalised the greater part of industry.<!-- end not in TUT --> Under the impact of economic
crisis on a world scale, it can be predicted that the ruling
caste, with the support of the workers and peasants, will
nationalise the rest of the economy. The bourgeoisie is so weak
and impotent that they are incapable of resistance. The officer
caste which carried out the revolution, with the support and
sympathy of the masses undeniably, did so because there was no
perspective of modern development for the nation under the old
system. There were no forces capable of resisting such change.
Imperialism is too weak and has learned the lesson in the failure
of the wars against the national revolutions in the post-war
period. With the model of Russia, China and now a whole series of
states, with the example of developments in Algeria, there is no
doubt that the ruling petit-bourgeois castes (as well as the
basis that the Bonapartist regime of Nasser has among the workers
and peasants) will support the complete nationalisation of the
productive forces, stage by stage. Only thus can the Egyptian
state enter into world developments.</p>


<p>It is easy for this caste to play this role
because their <span class="inote">[own]</span> privileges and income, their social role, can
be reinforced and increased. The bourgeois system in these areas
is so effete and prematurely decayed that it can offer no
perspective of development.</p>


<p>The most striking demonstration of the
correctness of this thesis are the events in Iraq. The Communist
Party, through its cowardly opportunism and the policy of
Kruschev not to disturb the imperialists in this area, failed to
take advantage of the revolutionary situation provoked by the
fall of the old regime. The impulsion of the masses ended in
disappointment and demoralisation. Nevertheless, the Kassem
<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">(3)</a></sup>
regime, while waging war on the Kurds, at the same time was
preparing measures of nationalisation.</p>


<p>The recent counter-revolutionary coup of the
army took place to prevent these measures. But now to maintain
themselves in power, and in view of the hopelessness of the
situation, <em>this very caste </em>which is carrying on the
reactionary war against the Kurdish people and which carried out
the bloody counter-revolutionary coup against the temporising
regime, has <em>itself </em>now announced measures of
nationalisation, which embrace all important industry and banks.
A great part of these were foreign owned, but nevertheless this
coup has taken place. Like Algeria, for the present, the oil
industry has been exempt from these measures, for fear of
reprisals from the powerful international oil interests. But the
tendency is there and will be further reinforced in the next
period.</p>


<p>In Asia the remorseless peasant war of
liberation in Vietnam, which has continued uninterrupted for 20
years, is nearing success. The American position in South
Vietnam, tomorrow in South Korea, is becoming untenable. The
attempt to prop up the old semi-feudal landlord capitalist state
is doomed to failure, especially with the example of China in the
near vicinity. The most far-sighted representatives of capitalism
are well aware of this process. De Gaulle, after his experience
in Algeria, has understood this problem clearly and wishes to
take advantage of it in the national interests of France. They
understand that the American war of oppression is as hopeless as
the French stand in Algeria. They see that landlordism and
capitalism in this area are doomed. How to face up to this
problem? There is no question with a peasant war under Stalinist
leadership and with only limited nationalist perspectives of
revolutionary contagion of the West. <!-- begin not in TUT -->The area is doomed to be lost in any event.<!-- end not in TUT --> Why not then try and ensure
the victory of a nationalist-Stalinist regime in Vietnam and the
rest of Indo-China, independent of China, like Yugoslavia is
independent of Russia?</p>


<p>They want a Vietnam&mdash;once the regrettable and
inevitable end of capitalism in the area is accepted as the
perspective&mdash;which would look to France and even America for aid
and assistance, in order to prop it up as a force independent of
Red China. The perspective of America in relation to Yugoslavia,
Poland and Rumania is their perspective for South East Asia.
Their policy is that of the lesser evil. Why not make the best of
a bad job and make the most of the contradictions of the national
Stalinist regimes? After all, they pose no direct social threat
to the metropolitan areas, no more than Algeria under nationalist
leadership did to France.</p>


<p>In Africa, Nkrumah<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-4" name="doc-4">(4)</a></sup> in Ghana speaks of
&#8220;African socialism&#8221;. Under the impact of events it is not
excluded that Ghana might take over all industry. This would be
so in the event of economic crisis on a world scale.</p>


<p>A similar process is taking place in the
Algerian revolution. Beginning as a national revolutionary war
against colonial oppression, Algeria finds itself in an impasse.
On the lines of capitalist society, there can be no solution <!-- begin not in TUT -->of its problems<!-- end not in TUT -->.
With the result, step by step, that Ben Bella and the FLN
(National Liberation Front) are being pushed in the direction of
a &#8220;socialist solution&#8221;.</p>


<p>Algeria lacks an industrial proletariat at the
present <!-- begin not in TUT -->time<!-- end not in TUT -->. The war was waged largely by the peasant-guerrilla army
plus a large stiffening of rural proletarians and
semi-proletarians. Had the leadership of the French proletariat
conducted itself in a revolutionary way, it would have had its
effect on the Algerian struggle but the betrayal of the French
Socialist and Communist Parties in their turn pushed the struggle
of the Algerian people through the FLN on to a purely nationalist
basis.</p>


<p>This in turn led to the situation where the
French workers, and technicians in Algeria, small colons and
shopkeepers were pushed into the arms of the fascist OAS (Secret
Army Organisation). The elements in Algeria supporting the
Socialist and Communist Parties deserted to the OAS. This in its
turn exacerbated the conflict. The victory of the revolution led
to the fleeing of the French technicians, artisans and skilled
workers to France, creating exceptional difficulties for the new
Algerian state. Right from the start, the control of Algeria has
been on the basis of Bonapartism. If in the early stages, the
elements of a weak workers&#8217; control existed in the enterprises
and partially in the estates expropriated from imperialism, these
cannot be of decisive significance in the future. Without an
industrial proletariat and without a conscious revolutionary
party, with half the population unemployed, the regime will
assume a more and more Bonapartist character.</p>


<p>History will demonstrate whether this will be a
proletarian form of Bonapartism or a bourgeois variant of
Bonapartism. The development of events should push the leadership
of the FLN and the army in the direction of establishing the
regime of nationalised property and of state ownership. It can
only be, with the nationalist perspective of the leadership, with
the social organisation of Algeria, with the lack of a conscious
proletariat and in the world setting of the present time, a
Stalinist dictatorship of the familiar model&mdash;a deformed
workers&#8217; state.</p>


<p>Symptomatic of the process is the development
of the ideology as put forward by Ben Bella&mdash;of Algerian
&#8220;Muslim&#8221; socialism. This Buddhist socialism, African socialism,
Muslim socialism and various other aberrations of a similar
character sum up themselves the process as it has taken place in
the backward countries of the world. The difference between these
revolutions and the proletarian revolutions as conceived by Marx
and Lenin, is summed up in the difference between
&#8220;Buddhist-Muslim-socialism&#8221; and conscious &#8220;scientific&#8221; socialism.
Of course, every revolutionary worth their salt would hail
enthusiastically the development of the colonial revolution even
on bourgeois lines; every blow against imperialism, every lifting
of the chains of national oppression, marks a step forward in the
struggle for socialism and would even be welcomed by all
enlightened elements of society.</p>


<p>Thus in the last 15 years the development of
the colonial revolution in whatever form, is an enormous step
forward for the world proletariat and for the mass of mankind as
a whole. It marks the stepping onto the stage of history of
peoples who have been kept at the level of animal existence by
imperialism, an existence hardly worthy of being called human.</p>


<p>Thus if the revolutionary working class would
hail as a step forward the victory of the colonial revolution and
national independence, even in a bourgeois form, the defeat of
capitalism and landlordism, the destruction of the elements of
bourgeois and landlord society obviously marks an even greater
step forward in the advance of these countries and the advance of
mankind.</p>


<p>In the process of the permanent revolution, the
failure of the bourgeoisie to solve the problems of the
capitalist democratic revolution, under the conditions of
capitalist society of modern times, is pushing towards
revolutionary victory.</p>


<p>Even the victory of a Marxist party, with the
knowledge and understanding of the process of deformation and
degeneration of Russia, China and other countries, would not be
sufficient to prevent the deformation of the revolution on
Stalinist lines, given the present relationship of world forces.</p>


<p>Revolutionary victory in backward countries
such as Algeria, under present conditions, whilst constituting a
tremendous victory for the world revolution and the world
proletariat, to be enthusiastically supported and aided by the
vanguard as well as by the world proletariat, cannot but be on
the lines of a totalitarian <!-- begin not in TUT -->Stalinist<!-- end not in TUT --> state.</p>


<p>Whilst constituting an enormous step forward
from the point of view of ending the stagnation and restriction
of productive forces imposed by imperialism, capitalism and
landlordism and bringing these countries onto the road of a
modern industrialised society, it cannot solve the problems posed
in front of these societies. New contradictions on a higher level
will inexorably be posed. The delay in the revolution in the West
has, as a penalty for colonial peoples, meant that the revolution
against imperialism and landlordism, moving forward to the
proletarian revolution, takes place on the basis of Bonapartist
deformation.</p>


<p>It is a striking indication of the weakness of
&#8220;Marxist&#8221; theorists and their lack of conscientiousness towards
the problems of the socialist revolution, that nowhere are the
problems of the different countries considered from the point of
view of world revolution and world socialism. Even within the
ranks of the &#8220;Fourth International&#8221;, under the pressure
of the great historical regression in theory and ideas, panaceas
are put in the place of Marxist perspective.</p>


<p>Of all <span class="inote">[the]</span> historical tendencies, that of
Bolshevism alone began with a clear internationalist perspective.
The Russian revolution was carried through clearly and
consciously as the beginning of revolution in Europe. This
internationalist perspective, an indispensable necessary basis
for socialist revolution, permeated not only the leading cadres
but the masses of people led by the Bolsheviks.</p>


<p>Internationalism was not conceived as a holiday
or sentimental phrase, but as an organic part of the socialist
revolution. Internationalism is a consequence of the unity of the
world economy, which was capitalism&#8217;s historical task to develop
into a single economic whole. If Russia, with all her immense
resources, and a most highly-conscious proletariat, with the
finest Marxist leadership, could not solve its problems despite
its continental basis and resources, it is ludicrous for Marxists
even to think that in the present world conjuncture it would be
possible in any of these backward countries, in isolation from
any healthy <em>workers&#8217; state </em>to maintain anything but a
Bonapartist state of a more or less repressive character.</p>


<p>Internationalism and conscious leadership&mdash;the
two go together &mdash; are an organic part of Marxism. Without them,
it is impossible to take the necessary steps in the direction of
socialist society. Not one of these states is, in proportion to
population, even as industrially developed as was Russia at the
time of the revolution. Industrial development of a backward
economy with the pressure of imperialism and Soviet and Chinese
Bonapartism, the pressure of internal contradictions which a
developing economy would mean, inevitably, in an economy of
scarcity, would lead to the rise of privileged layers.</p>


<p>The independence of the state from its mass
base, which all these countries possess in common (even where
they have had or have the support of the mass of the population,
either enthusiastically or passively), all indicate that on the
basis of backwardness, it is impossible to start the process of
dissolution of the state into society. The necessary
dismantlement of the temporary structures of the state, which
would be involved in a society with real democratic control and
participation on the part of the population is in itself an
indispensable prerequisite of a healthy transition to socialism.
Thus, the further development of these states is dependent on the
development of the world revolution.</p>


<p>In those colonial or ex-colonial countries
where the bourgeoisie has been enabled to maintain a precarious
balance for a temporary period, such as India and Sri Lanka, they
have maintained a semblance of bourgeois democracy. In many of
the states in Asia and Latin America, bourgeois democracy in one
form or another has been maintained on the basis of the economic
upswing developed since the war. In India, which had perhaps the
strongest bourgeoisie of all the ex-colonial countries, this
regime has succeeded in maintaining itself but the bourgeoisie in
the colonial world has no real perspective.</p>


<p>Thus, on the onset of the first <!-- begin not in TUT -->deep<!-- end not in TUT --> economic
crisis, if capitalism maintains itself in India, bourgeois
democracy will be doomed. To maintain itself, the bourgeoisie
will launch on the road of capitalist Bonapartism. The process
was clearly demonstrated in Pakistan<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-5" name="doc-5">(5)</a></sup>. In the other countries of
Asia and in practically all the countries of Africa, the upper
layers of that society have only been able to maintain themselves
on the basis of a one-party Bonapartist state&mdash;Ghana, Egypt etc.</p>


<p>On a bourgeois basis, such countries will be
condemned to decay and degeneration. Economically, politically,
socially, the bourgeoisie can only develop and aggravate the
problems of society. In India, the bourgeoisie has not solved the
problem of landlordism, the national problem or even the problem
of caste. The standard of living, despite the industrial
construction that has taken place, has actually declined relative
to the increase in population. Of all these states, the Indian
bourgeoisie had possibly the best opportunity of taking the road
of the development of a modern economy and a modern state.</p>


<p>Imperialism with one hand has rendered
assistance to India and with the other hand, through terms of
trade and tribute extracted from investments, has undermined the
position of the Indian bourgeoisie. If there has been a certain
development in industry, the exports of such countries have been
of light goods such as textiles, while the imports have been of
heavy machinery. With the enormous development of trade through
the division of labour between the metropolitan countries
themselves, the imperialists could allow a certain latitude in
the import of light goods from the colonial countries.</p>


<p>However, the last couple of decades have been
the <em>best </em>economic circumstances under which these
countries could function within the world market, to which they
are bound like Prometheus to the rock, and from which there is no
escape. Even in this most favourable period for capitalism as a
whole, the colonial countries&#8217; economics, relative to those of
the advanced countries, have suffered an even greater
deterioration than in the period of colonial dependence in the
years before the war. When it will be a question of the mighty
imperialist states looking to find a way to save themselves from
the crisis which the economic <em>downswing </em>will bring, the
&#8220;concessions&#8221; which they give to the colonial countries, because
of fear of revolutions within them, will be terminated in an
endeavour to prevent the mighty social explosions which impend in
their own metropolitan areas. Thus new convulsions and new storms
will develop in the metropolitan areas and certainly in all the
colonial countries.</p>


<p>No one, neither Marx nor Lenin nor Trotsky,
could put forward a blueprint for the development of society.
Only the basic and broad perspectives could be outlined. The
failure of the revolution in the West, the degeneration of
Stalinism, the failure of successive waves of the social
revolution in Western Europe, the thwarting of the social
revolution in the West and the expansion and consolidation of
Stalinism <!-- begin not in TUT -->in the East<!-- end not in TUT -->, have been the world background on which the
revolutionary awakening of the colonial peoples has been taking
place.</p>


<p>In Asia, the Chinese revolution has imposed its
imprint on the development of events. American imperialism&#8217;s
endeavours in Vietnam, in South Korea and other areas adjacent to
China, has merely underwritten the rotting social formations of
the past. They have endeavoured to step into the vacuum caused by
the expulsion of Anglo-French and Japanese imperialism from these
areas. The military police states in Vietnam and South
Korea and other areas in South East Asia can only be compared to
the rotting regime of Chiang Kai-Shek in the period before the
Second World War.</p>


<p>The weak bourgeoisie in these countries cannot
solve the problems of the bourgeois democratic revolution.
Without the intervention of American troops and money in Vietnam
and South Korea, these regimes would collapse overnight. Even
with the support of American imperialism, the implacable peasant
war in South Vietnam, which has continued uninterrupted since the
end of the Second World War, is undermining the regime and making
the victory of the peasant armies, in the long run, certain.
South Vietnam is as much a liability as was Chiang Kai-Shek. Only
the resources of American imperialism permit the throwing of
dollars down a bottomless sink.</p>


<p>In the immediate post-war period, only the
treacherous policy of Stalinism, above all of the Russian
bureaucracy, helped to maintain the precarious balance of forces
in Asia especially in the South East. But the impossibility of
finding a road to the development of modern society in these
areas dooms these regimes to the dustbin of history.
Consequently, at any stage, when the pressure of American
imperialism will be relaxed, for whatever reasons, and even in
spite of this, the collapse of <!-- begin not in TUT -->all<!-- end not in TUT --> these regimes is certain.</p>


<p>Developments in Burma, in Laos, in Cambodia
<span class="inote">[Kampuchea]</span>, are all indicative of the way in which the process
will develop. On the road of capitalism there is no way forward,
for all the countries of Asia. <em>In one form or another, there
will be an impulse in the direction of social revolution. </em>In
India and Sri Lanka, particularly the former, with a developed
proletariat, it is possible that the bourgeois democratic
revolution could be transformed into the socialist revolution on
the basis of the classical idea of the permanent revolution. The
installation of a workers&#8217; democracy would be its crowning
achievement, once the bourgeois democratic revolution has been
accomplished, with the proletariat, directly through a
revolutionary party, leading the struggle for power.</p>


<p>However, in these countries, even under the
leadership of a Trotskyist party, such as that of the Lanka Sama
Samaja Party<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-6" name="doc-6">(6)</a></sup> in Sri Lanka, the conquest of power by the proletariat
and the firm establishment of a workers&#8217; democracy could only be
an episode, to be followed by deformation or counter-revolution
in the Stalinist form, if it were not followed, in a relatively
short historical period, by the victory of the revolution in the
advanced capitalist countries. It would, of course, even as an
&#8220;episode&#8221; be of enormous historical significance for the
proletariat of the advanced capitalist countries as well as the
peoples of the underdeveloped areas of the world. But even the
greatest revolutionary theory cannot solve the problem without
the necessary material base.</p>


<p>It is only the complete incapacity of outlived
capitalism to solve the problems on its periphery which could
allow the conquest of power in these countries. Of course, with a
sub-continent such as India, the victory of the proletariat would
have enormous consequences in Britain and other European
countries as well, if it developed on the lines of China of
1925-7, with the proletariat playing the decisive part. On the
other hand, any development of revolution on the lines of the
Chinese revolution of 1944-9, with the peasantry playing the
decisive role through guerrilla war, would unfold in the same way
as the Chinese revolution of 1944-9.</p>


<p>However, the development of industry in India,
the different traditions of the country, give the proletariat a
preponderant weight in the social life of the country. Given that
Indian Marxists should create a revolutionary party in time, then
they could lead the working class to power, with the aim of
creating a workers&#8217; democracy; with the aim of leading the
peasantry to the overthrow of the landlord regime in the
countryside; with the aim of unifying the country as a step
towards the international socialist revolution.</p>


<p>Stalinist China, in its whole outlook, in its
methods, in its ideology, <span class="inote">[is]</span> not accidentally saturated with the
narrow nationalism of a bureaucratic caste. <em>If, in the
transition from feudalism to capitalism, a whole variety of
regimes in all the kaleidoscopic colours have revealed
themselves historically, it is because in this transition the
development of productive forces themselves has assured a certain
autonomism of progress; once the decisive</em> <span class="inote">[bourgeois]</span> <em>revolution
had been accomplished in Britain, France and America</em>.</p>

<p>Historically, due to the circumstances sketched out by Trotsky in
a whole series of works, and by the British Marxists in the
post-Trotsky period, <em>if the revolution is developing first in
the backward and weakest countries, this factor </em>(the
breakdown of capitalism at its weakest links) <em>has been
decisive for a temporary period in unfolding the distortions and
deformations in which the revolution in these countries is
developing.</em></p>


<p>The national limitations of the Chinese
Stalinists, their insistence in the quarrel with the Russian
Stalinists on mixing reactionary Stalinist ideas of the worst
type with demagogic anti-imperialist demands, is an indication
above all, of their incapacity really to understand the problems
of the world revolution and of their real aims and interests.
Even the solution of the national problems of the
&#8220;undeveloped&#8221; areas of the world is only conceived as part of
the diplomatic manoeuvres of the Chinese state.</p>


<p>Their idea of each country forming a national
entity to build its own variety of socialism is reactionary
through and through. But the idea of &#8220;socialism in one country&#8221;
did not drop from the skies; it reflected the interest of the
narrow bureaucratic caste in Russia, and similarly also in
Yugoslavia, Albania, Rumania and <span class="inote">[North]</span> Korea, these ideas reflect
the same processes and the same contradictions.</p>


<p>More than a decade and a half ago the British
Trotskyists, predicting in advance the victory of Chinese
Stalinism, also foretold the probability, even the inevitability,
of this narrow nationalist clique coming into collision and
breaking away from their Moscow comrades. The revolution in China
in that sense had a two-fold contradictory character. Enormously
progressive in its solution of the problems of Chinese
development, and giving an impetus to the national awakening of
two-thirds of mankind doomed to hunger and misery in the
so-called &#8220;undeveloped&#8221; areas of the world, at the same time, it
further reinforced the Stalinist dictatorship in Russia and
strengthened Stalinism throughout the world.</p>


<p>In the metropolitan centres of capitalism the
Stalinist parties could bask, not only in the usurped mantle of
the Russian revolution, but in the aura of the great Chinese
revolution. The history of Chinese Stalinism would show, since
its advent to power, that it never rose, and by the nature of its
ideology, methods and perspectives, never could rise above the
narrow national horizon.</p>


<p>Its methods in Asia, even in the intervention
in the Korean War, were dictated not by internationalist
considerations, but purely by the strategic political and
economic interests of the &#8220;Chinese State&#8221; i.e. of the bureaucracy
itself. Its opportunist agreement with the Nehru government not
to alter the social relations of the feudal theocratic state of
Tibet, in return for an agreement with the Indian bourgeoisie,
was upset by the attempted counter-revolution in Tibet. This
compelled the bureaucracy to lean on the serfs and peasants and
destroy the old Tibetan society.</p>


<p>Even in the war with India on the border and
the strategic road between Sinkiang and Tibet, its conduct of the
war was dictated only by nationalist considerations and not that
of provoking internal class struggle in India itself. Its
criticism of Moscow and of the opportunist policies of the
French, Italian and other Communist Parties in the West, is more
or less an afterthought and an attempt to gain support for the
policies and methods and ideas of the Chinese state. <em>At no
time has it raised the ideal elementary for Marxism, of a
Federation of all Asia on a socialist basis.</em></p>


<p><em>At no time has the problem of a Russo-Chinese
Federation been put forward, which would automatically have
been the issue in the event of a revolution on Leninist
principles in China and had there been a Leninist regime in the
Soviet Union.</em> Thus, before the Chinese revolution and other
revolutions in Asia could be placed on the road of transition to
socialism, the proletariat and peasants, the people of these
countries, would have to pay with a new revolution, this time not
a social revolution, but a <em>political revolution, </em>to
install workers&#8217; democracy.</p>


<p>It is the historic task, unconsciously perhaps,
of these regimes to prepare the material and social forces (to a
certain extent, the historical task which capitalism in these
countries was incapable of developing to the same extent as in
the West) of the proletariat and of industry to prepare the base
for socialism. The victory in the backward countries of Asia of
the social revolution in a bastardised form provokes social
contradictions internally with the very growth of the productive
forces themselves and at the same time, as far as the advanced
workers of the West, and as the proletariat as a whole are
concerned, a confusion of ideas in relation to socialism and its
task.</p>


<p>The Russian revolution provoked an immense
revolutionary awakening of the proletariat of the West and of the
East. It raised the level of consciousness of the sleeping
proletariat of Western Europe to a level never seen in history
before. It raised the ideas of theory, of understanding, of
Marxism, to a new and higher level. The idea of soviets, of
workers&#8217; control, of workers&#8217; democracy, of a transitional
society, were understood by broad layers of the advanced workers
in the West.</p>


<p>This consciousness arose on the basis of the
greatest democratic and social movement of the masses in the
whole of human history. In its liberating effect, in the
theoretical conclusions, <!-- begin not in TUT -->in its raising of the level of mass consciousness,<!-- end not in TUT --> even the Paris Commune and the lessons
that the genius Marx drew from it, have paled into
insignificance.</p>


<p>Had the revolution of 1925-7 in China
succeeded, it could only have done so with a similar pattern to
the events of 1917. That is why, at the time, Trotsky looked
confidently to the effects that the Chinese revolution would have
in Russia, leading to the overthrow of the Soviet bureaucracy,
because it would rouse and mobilise in its revolutionary heat the
Soviet proletariat. At the same time it would have aroused echoes
within the proletariat of the capitalist countries of the West,
thus tying the revolution together into one indissoluble knot.
Trotsky looked to this development of &#8220;permanent revolution&#8221;
because he conceived the Chinese revolution with the background
and perspective of world socialism.</p>


<p>The bureaucracy in Russia, while at best
regarding the 1949 revolution with lukewarm favour (Stalin and
the bureaucracy not believing in <span class="inote">[the possibility of]</span> revolutionary
victory even in the caricatured form in which it was taking
place) nevertheless did not and could not regard the victory of
the bastardised Bonapartist form as a threat to the position, or,
if one wishes, an immediate threat to the position of the
bureaucracy in the Soviet Union.</p>


<p>It is an incontestable, historical fact,
foreshadowed and explained by British Marxists, that ironically,
the extension of the revolution to China, Eastern Europe and to
the other countries of Asia where Bonapartist regimes had been
established, added to the cohesion, the confidence and the power
of the bureaucracy in the Soviet Union for a whole historical
period.</p>


<p>One has only to compare the revolution in a
backward country <span class="inote">[like]</span> Spain, which Trotsky likened to the
relations of an Asiatic country rather than a modern European
state, to see the difference that a revolution in which the
proletariat plays the decisive and dominant role must have in its
national and international effects. The <span class="inote">[1931-7]</span> revolution in
Spain, had it succeeded, would have precipitated the revolution
in France, in Germany and the other countries of Western Europe.
The intervention on the scene of history of the heroic
proletariat of Spain <span class="inote">[would]</span> have undermined the position of the
Soviet bureaucracy also.</p>


<p>The desperate support of the bureaucracy for
the bourgeois counter-revolution in so-called Republican Spain
was dictated by the frantic fear of the rising of the Russian
proletariat. Victory in Spain on the basis of some form of
workers&#8217; democracy would have led swiftly to the victory of the
political revolution in the Soviet Union. In this international
and national role of the proletariat in all these revolutions can
be seen the difference between the hybrid form of the transition
even where victorious in backward countries <!-- begin not in TUT -->&mdash; under present circumstances<!-- end not in TUT --> &mdash; and the proletarian
revolution as conceived by Lenin and Trotsky.</p>

 
<p>Again it is not a question of sentiment or
formalism but of the organic connection of socialism with a
conscious participation and control of the working class.</p>


<p>One only has to compare the great Chinese
revolution with the political revolution in Hungary<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-7" name="doc-7">(7)</a></sup>, to
see the importance and difference between the revolution in its
Bonapartist form and the political revolution. In Hungary we had
the immediate participation and upsurge of the working class as
the dominant force in the revolution, <em>immediately organising its
organs of self-expression, democracy and control.</em></p>


<p>After 20 years of fascist terror, after 10
years of Stalinist terror, the workers of Hungary revealed the
tremendous tenacity of the ideas of socialism and workers&#8217;
democracy, as the only means of assuring the development of
future society. The workers, as if they had read the programme
worked out by Trotsky, in every detail put forward the demands
which Trotsky (reflecting the ideas, interests and aspirations of
the proletariat) had worked out would be the demands of the
workers in a political revolution in Russia.</p>


<p><em>Whereas the revolution in Eastern Europe and
China had been regarded as a welcome adjunct and extension of the
power, privilege and vested interests of the bureaucracy, the
revolution in Hungary struck terror in the hearts
of the bureaucrats from Peking, through Moscow to Belgrade. </em>The
fate of all the regimes of Eastern Europe hung in the balance.
Not since the Spanish revolution had there been such a social
earthquake, which stirred the proletariat of the Soviet Union and
of the other workers&#8217; states. That is why, <em>on the
frantic urging of Mao Tse-Tung and the other Stalinist leaders,
the Soviet bureaucracy had to intervene in Hungary and drown
the revolution in blood </em>before the proletariat could create
in the fire of the revolution, as always in such circumstances,
the necessary Marxist party and leadership. The hot flame of the
revolution rendered the proletarian troops of the Russian army of
occupation completely unreliable. They had to be withdrawn and
only the most backward troops from Siberia, untouched at that
stage by the revolutionary events, could be used to drown the
revolution in blood.</p>


<p>As Marxist theory would expect, whereas the
revolution in China appeared as a remote event, with perhaps the
sympathy of the more advanced workers among the proletariat of
Western Europe, it did not in the eyes of the proletariat of
Western Europe affect them as an event directly connected with
their <!-- begin not in TUT -->own<!-- end not in TUT --> interests and aspirations. The Hungarian revolution, like
the Spanish before it, immediately awakened the interest of the
mass of the working class in Western Europe. Apart from its
repercussions in the Communist Parties of the West, among the
advanced layers, it also aroused an echo among the broad masses
in the factories, in the workshops and wherever the workers were
gathered together in industry.</p>


<p>The difference between the effects of the
revolution in colonial countries at present and the revolution in
backward countries like that of China 1925-7, was because the
latter was on the model of the Russian revolution as far as the
participation of the social classes was concerned. Similarly for
the Spanish revolution, also a revolution in a backward country.
If these revolutions did not lead to victory over the
bourgeoisie, it was directly because of the proletariat&#8217;s
leadership.</p>


<p>The proletariat strove, with all the efforts of
which that class is capable, to carry through the revolutionary
transformation of society <em> la Russe. </em>In China and the
other areas where the revolution had been victorious since the
Second World War, in the main all backward countries, <em>the
proletariat did not play the same role as it did in Spain, in
China in 1925-7 and in the Hungarian revolution.</em></p>


<p>Those comrades who have newly discovered the
peasantry and the semi-proletariat and even the village
proletariat as the main revolutionary force in these colonial
revolutions, have not understood the real significance of the
role which these classes have played. Where the proletariat is
led by a conscious revolutionary party, the petit-bourgeois in
town and countryside, under the firm leadership of the
proletariat, can support the victory of the working class and the
installation of its revolutionary dictatorship, i.e. in the sense
of the dictatorship of the proletariat, in Trotsky&#8217;s expression,<em>
according to the norm</em>. Even here, this can only be done where
such a revolution organically, step by step, is linked to the
prospect and the ideas of a socialist revolution on a world
scale. In the <em>History of the Russian Revolution</em>,
 <sup><a href="../../../../archive/trotsky/1930/hrr/index.htm">[source]</a></sup> Trotsky
quotes a peasant soldier influenced by the propaganda and
agitation of Bolshevism, who spoke of the world revolution as the
only salvation for the revolution. Thus the Russian revolution in
a backward country provoked the &#8220;Ten Days that Shook the World&#8221;.</p>


<p>The idea of leaning on the peasant masses, of
the &#8220;revolutionary elements with nothing to lose&#8221; and of the
lumpen proletariat as a revolutionary force, superior to the
&#8220;respectable industrial proletariat&#8221; which has a higher standard
of living, as the decisive force in the revolution, is the idea
of Bakunin<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-8" name="doc-8">(8)</a></sup> and not of Marx or Trotsky. True, these classes under
the influence of the revolutionary leadership of the proletariat
- again dependent on the revolutionary role of its leadership -
can play an important role in the revolution, as the peasantry
did in Russia and to a certain extent <span class="inote">[as]</span> the petit-bourgeoisie in
the towns also rallied to the side of Bolshevism.</p>


<p>But by the very nature of these classes, where
they played the dominant role in a transition, where they are
&#8220;used&#8221; in the Machiavellian sense by a Stalinist, an ex-Marxist
or Bonapartist leadership, this places a decisive stamp on the
revolution. Such a role for these classes is only possible
because of the impasse of world capitalism and imperialism, on
the one side, and the existence of the present balance of world
forces on a world scale, the latent power of the proletariat in
the industrially advanced countries and, most decisive of all,
the existence of the mighty Bonapartist deformed workers&#8217; states.
But where these classes play the dominating role in the
destruction of capitalism in the backward countries, they lay
their stamp on the development of events.</p>


<p>The revolutionary peasant armies of China could
be likened to the armies of Cromwell, in the sense that the army
and the party fused together in the fight. While using the
phrases of socialism, they could not have the same collective
consciousness of socialism, which almost instinctively develops
in the proletariat in industry.</p>


<p>Thus these classes can play the key role of the
reserve troops of the revolution, of the <em>battering ram</em>, but
the sharp point of the revolution can only be a revolutionary
consciousness of the industrial working class. Religion and all
the other prejudices and superstitions accumulated for centuries
and even millennia still play an important and even decisive role
in the ideology of these states. This is reflected in the
ideology and public statements of the leaders of these movements,
such as in Algeria, and is of decisive significance in
characterising the type of state which has emerged and will
emerge in the revolutions in these countries (without a victory
of the proletariat in the industrial countries of the West).</p>


<p>These traits are not accidental. To even
suggest such abominations on the part of a Marxist leadership
would be criminal. Only Stalinism and social democracy have
debased the revolutionary consciousness for these purposes. Of
course, with all the blemishes, warts and defects, the
significance of the social change for Marxists is decisive.
Whilst not throwing out the baby with the bathwater one must, at
the same time, if one is to preserve the continuity of Marxist
ideas and find the road to a correct policy, understand the
inevitable result of the role and<!-- begin not in TUT --> relationship of classes including the petit-bourgeoisie of town and country in deciding the social role and <!-- end not in TUT -->character of the revolution.</p>


<p>These classes cannot play an <em>independent</em> role.
Where they are organised by the leadership of ex-Marxists or by
intellectual strata of the petit-bourgeoisie in one form or
another&mdash;the army officers of Burma, Egypt, the ex-Marxists in
China, the intellectual layers of the petit-bourgeoisie in Ghana
and other countries&mdash;it is possible under the historical
conditions sketched above, with a weak and rotting bourgeoisie,
or even the absence of any real bourgeoisie, for a transitional
regime of a <em>Bonapartist workers&#8217; state </em>to be set up.</p>


<p>When one considers the confusion that prevails
throughout the labour movement and infects even the advanced
layers of the Marxist cadres on these questions, one has only to
think of the crystal clear ideas of Lenin and Trotsky on the role
of the state.</p>


<p>Even under the most favourable of historical
conditions, with a developed proletariat playing a dominant role
in society, they have warned, echoing in this the elementary
ideas of Marx, <em>of the danger that lies in the very existence of
the state</em>. The state, or to be more accurate, the semi-state,
even in the advanced countries, constitutes a source of danger
and of infection, which only the highest revolutionary
consciousness and vigilance on the part of the proletariat and
its leadership can prevent from degeneration and deformation.</p>


<p>The rise of Stalinism in Russia was no
accident, but was due to the isolation of the revolution from the
advanced countries of the West. Even what is unthinkable in the
present world relationship of forces, a proletarian victory in an
advanced capitalist country that did not spread to other
countries, would be in danger over a long and historical period
of degeneration and collapse.</p>


<p>But the whole relationship of forces on a world
scale, the whole development of the epoch, has been such that a
single revolutionary victory in Western Europe, in Japan, in
Britain or America will be sufficient to transform the world
scene. It would spread like a bush fire, far faster and with far
more profound effects than even the Russian revolution.</p>


<p>Let us go further and pose the problem that in
a country like Italy or France, where the proletariat plays an
overwhelmingly decisive role and where its latent power has been
further reinforced by the development of industry, that the
Stalinists under the influence of the revolutionary wave should
be pushed into power, which is not theoretically excluded. It is
true that at the present time both the <span class="inote">[Italian and the French
Stalinist]</span> parties are second-line defenders of the bourgeois
state but, under the impact of a revolutionary wave, they would
put forward their most left face.</p>


<p><em>If they were pushed in the direction of taking
power, it could only be with a mobilisation of the full
resources, revolutionary energy and capacity for organisation and
struggle on the part of the proletariat. Such a proletariat would
not allow the development of bureaucracy as in the backward
countries, where the proletariat has not played the dominant
role.</em> Without the mobilisation of the proletariat to its
uttermost extent, as in France in 1936, as in Germany in 1918, as
in Spain in 1936 and 1937, victory over the bourgeoisie could not
be assured.</p>


<p>But a revolutionary victory would transform the
situation nationally and internationally. The Stalinist party
would burst at the seams. On the other hand one can make the
confident prognosis that the far more likely development would be
that the great new revolutionary events would cause an immediate
crisis within the ranks of the Stalinist parties in all the
industrial countries, spreading to the countries of the Eastern
bloc.</p>


<p>The events of the last two decades took place
and were influenced by the Stalinist syphilis. At the moment the
splits of world Stalinism, the development of nationalist
deviations on the part of the deformed workers&#8217; states, the
&#8220;independent&#8221; nationalist role of the Communist parties in the
capitalist countries, the ceding of the decisive role in social
transformations in Cuba, Algeria, Ghana and other countries to
petit-bourgeois layers of nationalist intellectuals, is an
historical confirmation of the role which Trotsky predicted would
mark the end of the Communist International as a revolutionary
force.</p>


<p>The crisis within world Stalinism is of such a
character that the fanatical unthinking adherence, the blind
loyalty which was given by revolutionary workers, even by the
advanced layers, has been ended. But even this takes a
dialectical form. The old type Stalinist was far more
revolutionary <!-- begin not in TUT -->in consciousness and understanding<!-- end not in TUT --> than the present layers within the ranks of the
Stalinist party, at least in the industrially advanced countries.</p>


<p>Two decades of &#8220;peaceful&#8221; social relations, in
comparison with the upheavals of the pre-war days, since the end
of the revolutionary upheavals following the Second World War,
have dulled the consciousness of the advanced layers within the
Stalinist movement. Two decades of theoretical and chauvinist
poison systematically disseminated by the Stalinist party have
lowered the theoretical level of the Stalinist movement. This,
coinciding <!-- begin not in TUT -->with and interacting <!-- end not in TUT -->with the period of capitalist upsurge and growth, and
interacting with it, has led to a lowering of the theoretical
level of the rank and file of the movement.</p>


<p>Within the ranks of the Communist parties,
however, the shocks and upheavals of the Stalinist world, the
20th Congress, Hungary, the new splits between Stalinist states,
above all the split between Russia and China, open the way at a
later stage for the decisive transformation of the relations
within these parties. Never again in the face of revolutionary
events will the rank and file accept unquestioningly the
counter-revolutionary role which the Stalinists played in the
mass capitalist countries in the past epoch.</p>


<p>However, the development on these lines will be
more complicated than could have been foreseen. In criticising
the programme of the Communist International in the early stages,
Trotsky had predicted that the theory of &#8220;socialism in one
country&#8221; would lead inevitably to the degeneration on nationalist
lines of the parties of the Communist International. In a
peculiar historical way this has been borne out by events in the
countries where the Stalinists have come to power because of the
peculiar development of history, as well as in the capitalist
countries.</p>


<p>The brilliant prediction of Trotsky, perhaps in
a way which could not have been foreseen, has nevertheless shown
the power of Marxist foresight and analysis in dealing with the
fundamental principles. These principles arise from the class
relations within society. Any tendency in the labour movement
which does not at each great historical turn review events from
this fundamental standpoint, runs the risk, possibly the
inevitability, of coming under the influence<!-- begin not in TUT --> and pressure<!-- end not in TUT --> of hostile
tendencies in the labour movement such as reformism or Stalinism.</p>


<p>The deformed character of the Chinese
revolution, its inevitable reflection of the needs and interests
of the elite bureaucracy, the shouldering aside of even the
peasants, let alone the workers, in the ruling <!-- begin not in TUT -->of the <!-- end not in TUT -->state, inevitably
stamps the outlook of the ruling Chinese clique. It has more in
common with Mandarinism<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-9" name="doc-9">(9)</a></sup>, in the tradition of China, rather than that of a
healthy workers&#8217; state, in the sense of the domination of the
state by a ruling aristocratic, bureaucratic elite.</p>


<p>Their entire criticism <span class="inote">[of other Stalinists]</span> is
dominated by nationalist considerations, as is, of course, the
rotting Stalinist bureaucracy of Russia. Their whole policy, both
in world diplomacy and in their intervention in the workers&#8217;
movement, is dictated by nationalist considerations. The most
significant aspect of their struggle against the Russian
bureaucracy is their nationalist orientation and perspective.
They go even further than Stalin himself dared, to talk about
&#8220;centuries of building socialism in China.&#8221;</p>


<p>Their criticism of the opportunism of
Togliatti, Thorez <span class="inote">[Italian CP and French CP leaders,
respectively]</span> and the British and American communists, was linked
to the idea that it was &#8220;not their business&#8221; they did not want to
&#8220;interfere&#8221; in the internal affairs of these parties; only the
criticism of the Chinese by these leaderships provoked the
retaliation of the Chinese. It is obvious that the Chinese were
not asleep for 15 years and suddenly rediscovered the works of
Marx and Lenin.</p>


<p>Their criticism of the proposed Comecon
agreement between the Eastern European states and Russia was of
the worst type of narrow nationalism. It is true that the
Russians proposed this to reinforce their control and domination
over these states. But the solution lay in proposing a Balkan
Federation of States, linked to federation with Russia. This in
turn should be linked to a mighty federation with China. <em>But that
is what is impossible with the domination of the bureaucracy of
all these countries.</em></p>


<p>What determines the policy of all of them is
the narrow clique interests of the ruling elite. Consequently
they all have to base themselves on the most reactionary
nationalist prejudices and chauvinism. Only a party resting on
the real interests of the proletariat can base itself on genuine
internationalism through the inter-penetration of the economy of
these countries, for the mutual benefit of all. The imperative
need of the world economy to be joined in unity, as against the
wastefulness and insanity of particularism, is recognised by the
bourgeoisie themselves, as evidenced in the Common Market and
other attempted agreements. The bourgeoisie cannot solve this
problem, but can only take partial measures, which in the end
will collapse into the opposite of &#8220;internationalism&#8221;&mdash;virulent
nationalism and tariff walls.</p>


<p>Trotsky many times emphasised that the twin
evils of the modern epoch were private ownership, plus the
hampering restrictions of the nation state. These were the main
impediments to the development of the productive forces of the
modern epoch and the reason why the capitalist system on a world
scale was ripe and overripe for the social revolution.</p>


<p>In the backward countries, for a temporary
historical period, the achievement of the national state by the
expulsion of imperialism remains a powerful and relatively
progressive force. But on the world scale, these states
immediately come up against the hampering and overwhelming
domination of the advanced countries.</p>


<p>But in the countries where the proletariat
would come to power, whether in advanced or backward countries,
it is the <em>international </em>perspective which is decisive.
This alone would condemn the haughty nationalist bureaucracies of
these countries. They simultaneously played a <em>progressive </em>role
in relation to the defence of the foundations of the regime, i.e.
nationalised property, but an enormously reactionary role in
defence of their privileges, which is summed up in <em>narrow
nationalism</em>.</p>


<p>It is not of importance here to go into the
theoretical perspectives of modern development and the different
variants gone into by Trotsky in his last articles, so
misunderstood and distorted by Shachtman, Deutscher<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-10" name="doc-10">(10)</a></sup> and
Cliff. But what is of interest is the emphasis which Trotsky
gives to the fact that the historical task is not only the
destruction of capitalism but the ending of the old national
economies which are constricting and hampering the development of
productive forces.</p>


<p>In fact, Trotsky gives decisive importance to
the question of the reactionary role of the national state and
shows that the mere destruction of private ownership, of enormous
historical importance, would nevertheless only be an episode
without the destruction of the former.</p>


<p>Had the Russian workers retained control of
their state, the revolutions in China and Eastern Europe could
not have assumed their reactionary nationalist character. The
problems which the development of Siberia poses, would have been
solved by the welcome emigration of tens of millions of Chinese
peasants to Siberia, to be trained by Russian technicians and the
joint use of resources of this fabulously rich area, for the
benefit of both peoples and the cementing of federation between
them.</p>


<p>Instead of this modestly practical scheme,
neither the Russian bureaucracy nor the Chinese, limited by their
caste interests, could pose the problem in this way. The Chinese,
from their point of view, pose the problem of &#8220;national&#8221;
socialism, each country developing its own resources, while the
Russians pose as &#8220;internationalist&#8221; i.e. to use the power of their
industrial position to dominate the weaker economies of the
smaller Stalinist states in Eastern Europe. The national
limitedness of Chinese Stalinism screams from every page of their
documents. In this respect, there is nothing to choose between
the two powerful Stalinist states.</p>


<p>It is one of the ironical paradoxes of history
that in the advanced economies of Western Europe, the degenerate
Stalinist leaderships clothe themselves in the stinking rags of
outmoded nationalism. They criticise <em>from the nationalist
standpoint</em> the hopeless attempts of the bourgeoisie to overcome
the impediment of the national state, a task which the modern
bourgeoisie is incapable of carrying out, despite their ludicrous
and feeble attempts.</p>


<p>For the Marxist wing in the labour movement any
criticism of the warring Stalinist factions must begin with this
standpoint. No concessions can be made to the degenerate
nationalism of all wings of Stalinism. Trotsky explained the
weakness of the Fourth International, among other reasons, by the
power of nationalist ideas and traditions.</p>


<p>Now in the metropolitan countries of the West,
the Stalinists have become partially a second reformist agency of
the bourgeoisie rather than, as in the past, a faithful tool of
the foreign policy of the Russian bureaucracy.</p>


<p>The struggle between Russia and China gives a
certain independence to the bureaucracy of the Communist parties.
Decades of poisonous and chauvinist propaganda have disorientated
the upper layers of the Communist parties in the metropolitan
countries and even affected the rank and file. But the big
majority of the cadre elements, uneasily in opposition and
looking to Peking for a revolutionary lead, will only be won to
the banner of Marxism if these aspects of internationalism and of
theory are emphasised and stressed.</p>


<p>The entire cadres of the Stalinist parties have
been miseducated on these questions for decades. It is our task
in approaching these cadres to emphasise these problems. At the
dawn of the struggle of the Left Opposition it was this problem
that was emphasised, underlined and stressed by Trotsky. Not for
nothing did Trotsky write a <em>Criticism of the Draft Programme
of the Communist International</em><sup><a href="../../../../archive/trotsky/1928/3rd/index.htm">[source]</a></sup>
on these questions. Since the
decades have passed&mdash;and what decades&mdash;every event has
demonstrated the correctness of this approach. It was always
central to the thought of Trotsky. Those comrades who dream of
an &#8220;easier&#8221; approach are deluding themselves. Nor is it feasible
to imagine that an opportunist approach on &#8220;current&#8221;, &#8220;modern&#8221;
lines will succeed, while the revolutionary approach is left for
the bedroom.</p>


<p>Why should any cadres in the Russian wing or
the Chinese wing approach the Fourth International unless they have something
to offer? What have we to offer, at this stage, except the
theories of the masters, reinforced and enriched by the
experience of the last decades? Episodic criticisms will drive
those cadres becoming critical to one side or the other. As far
as the masses are concerned, we do not have their ears as yet.</p>


<p>In some senses, the crisis of Stalinism has
sown further confusion within the ranks of the Communist parties.
Their lack of education in the fundamentals of Marxism, the
degeneration of Stalinism on nationalist lines, the apparent
lustre of revolutionary victories in China and other countries,
tomorrow the victory of the peasant war in Vietnam, have muddled
and confused their ranks. But the quarrels of all the nationalist
Stalinist factions, particularly that between China and Russia,
have laid the seeds of terrific crises in the Stalinist parties,
particularly in the metropolitan countries.</p>


<p>In a certain sense, the immediate effect of the
Russo-Chinese conflict as far as the mass membership of the
Communist Party is concerned, is to make the task of the Marxists
more difficult. Many cadres, embittered by the opportunism of the
Communist parties, have welcomed what they conceive as the
&#8220;revolutionary&#8221; turn of the Chinese. Instead of mighty Russia,
they look to mighty Peking as the revolutionary centre. They will
not be interested in incidental criticism.</p>


<p>Nevertheless, from a historical point of view,
the crisis opens up a way for the complete transformation of the
world scene. The labour bureaucracy in Western Europe have long
lost the uncritical enthusiasm of their followers. The uncritical
adherence of the ranks within the Communist Party is also now
ended. There cannot be more than one Rome or one Pope.</p>


<p>On the basis of the great events which impend
in the next decade or two, as Trotsky predicted, perhaps a little
belatedly, not one stone will remain upon the other of the old
&#8220;Internationals&#8221; of the working class. The changed consciousness
of the masses will be revealed in the mass Communist parties,
especially in France and Italy. Never again will the ranks of the
Communist parties tolerate without mighty movements of protest,
the sell-outs and betrayals of 1936 in France and Spain and in
1944-7<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-11" name="doc-11">(11)</a></sup> in France and Italy. The Communist parties would be split from top to bottom.</p>


<p>Above all, it is necessary for the Fourth International to make
an implacable criticism of the nationalism of both the Russian
and Chinese bureaucracies. For the Fourth International in the colonial
countries, the problem is exceptionally difficult. It is not easy
for peasant masses to see beyond the national horizon. Their
outlook is strictly limited. They can be led in this direction
only by the proletariat and by concrete linking up of their
material interests with that of an international perspective.</p>


<p>The doctrine of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, by its
very nature, is suited to the outlook of the proletariat at
certain stages in history. Of course the proletariat too is not
impervious to the nationalist poison. That is why it is necessary
in appealing to the advanced workers to <em>stress and emphasise the
problem of an internationalist approach </em>not only in the
advanced countries, but in the backward countries as well. Unless
they understand this, the cadres will be lost. No
concessions can be made on this question to any other tendencies
in the movement.</p>


<p>Of course, from the point of view of world
politics, the magnificent revolt of the colonial people is
preparing an entirely new relationship of forces on a world
scale. Once, however, the heavy battalions enter the scene of
history in Western Europe, Japan or America, the whole
relationship of forces on a world scale will be changed.</p>


<p>Trotsky once warned of the possibility of the
disappearance of the Fourth International if it did not find a
road to the masses. This can be reinforced with a further
warning. Unless the basic ideas of Trotskyism, enriched and
developed but in fundamentals the same, are not emphasised and
drummed into the consciousness of the cadres, the International can degenerate impressionistically and tail behind the
left reformists, Chinese Stalinists or Russian Stalinists. There
must be no empirical bowing down to events, the basic issues must
be brought forward again and again, especially in the theoretical
works and journals of the International.</p>


<p>The problem has to be posed sharply: either the
colonial revolutions have taken the particular form they have
because of the delay in the revolution in the advanced
countries...or there is no role for the Fourth International except
as self-appointed and benevolent advisors to Castro, Mao and Ben
Bella.</p>


<p>Here it should be made clear that from a
Marxist point of view the arguments of Plekhanov and the
theoreticians of Menshevism&mdash;that Russia was not ripe for
socialism in 1917 are and were perfectly correct...<em>if Russia
is taken in isolation from the world and the internationalist
perspectives of Bolshevism</em>. All other tendencies, cliques and
groupings in the labour movement are doomed to sterility and
collapse for lack of the internationalist perspective as the
basis for their work. The colonial revolutions mark a gigantic
step forward for all mankind. But <!-- begin not in TUT -->their very success poses new contradictions and convulsions for all of them. The<!-- end not in TUT -->
solution of the problem can only be found in the international
arena and in the victory of the working class in the advanced
countries.</p>

<!-- begin not in TUT -->

<p>
The conditions in which the revolution has taken place, and is developing in these countries, dooms them to new political revolutions, for the purpose of creating workers&#8217; democracy. The task of Marxism consists in arming at least the vanguard in understanding these developments and the problems they pose.</p>


<p>
Above all the advanced elements in the C.P. can be won on a firm basis, only if they understand this basic approach. An eclectic approach that the Chinese are right in this argument or the Russians right on that, will convince hardly anybody. It can only confuse the cadres of Trotskyism themselves by hair-splitting and scholasticism.</p>


<p>
The real reason for the conflict between Russia and China must be brought out sharply. For Marxists this can only be the Great Power National Interests of both Bureaucracies, i.e. the power, privileges, income and prestige of the ruling stratum in both countries. This is not incidental to the argument but must be the central theme. It is impossible to explain this phenomenon, like that of the policy of the Labour Bureaucracy, in any other way and still claim to stand on the principles of Marxism. It is not merely the ideological ghosts and rationalisations that we must be concerned with, but the real and corporeal interests of the bureaucracy.</p>


<p>
Today as always Marxism remains the science of perspectives. Without a clear perspective the international movement will be doomed to degeneration and collapse.</p>


<p>
These events in the Colonial world have been taking place on the basis of a prolonged economic upswing in the metropolitan countries. They are the best conditions that world capitalism can offer the colonial peoples. What happens in the inevitable downswing?</p>


<p>
The one party state which has issued from these revolutions and colonial liberations in many areas, is naturally Bonapartist in character. The weak bourgeoisie, where it exists is elbowed aside, in many areas of Africa and Asia, there is not even a bourgeoisie in existence. It is the intellectuals, chiefs and upper petit-bourgeois layers who have been pushed into control. That is the situation in the Congo, Ghana and former British East Africa.</p>


<p>
Under conditions of slump there will be a veritable landslide in Asia, Africa and Latin America in the direction of social revolution in this peculiar form. Only in South Africa on the African continent is there a large industrial proletariat, which can assume the decisive role played in Russia and other countries by the proletariat.</p>


<p>
The most striking feature of all these regimes is their incapacity to solve the problem of antiquated national boundaries. Nasser has failed to unify the Arab States. Kenyatta has boasted of his manoeuvre to outwit the Imperialists and gain independence by pretending to agree to an East African Federation! Nkrumah&#8217;s attempt to form an all-African Federation has been fruitless up to the present time. Thus they are all impotent to solve this fundamental question.
The curious character of the regimes issuing from the colonial revolution is due to the lag in the taking of power by the proletariat in the advanced metropolitan countries. It is a further reinforcement of the fact that capitalism has become rotten ripe for the social revolution.</p>


<p>
Where a class has come belatedly on the scene and is incapable of playing the role historically demanded of it, that task is taken over by other classes and social forces. In the transition from feudalism to capitalism, in Japan for example, the ruling nobility transformed itself into an industrial ruling class. This has laid its peculiar stamp on Japanese social relations right to the present day. In Germany the failure or incapacity of the bourgeoisie, led, as Marx and Engels pointed out to the Junkers carrying out or partially carrying out the tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. This laid its stamp on German social relations, but nevertheless remained a decisive fact for Germany for a whole historical period and left traces in social relations right up to the present clay.</p>


<p>
In the present epoch it is absurd to believe that a bourgeois state on normal lines, can develop in Ceylon, or Kenya or Iraq for example. They have come too late on the historical scene and there is no room for the development of a bourgeoisie like that of France, Britain or America. They cannot hope to compete with the mighty industrial infrastructure of the metropolitan countries.</p>


<p>
They cannot remain as the suppliers of raw materials and food in return for industrial products, under penalty of collapse and decay. Oh the road of capitalism there can only be e feeble industrial development. They must find a different road or make way for anarchy or new forces.</p>


<p>
They have a ready made model in the Bonapartist clique in Moscow. Not for nothing did Kruschev observe this process developing with the nationalist regimes in Africa with satisfaction, on his visit to Egypt. His strictures to Aref the Iraqi dictator, were followed by the nationalisations in Iraq, and the lavish Russian aid, Kruschev remarked that the nationalist peoples were following the road of "Socialism" without even having a "Communist" Party to carry it out. Such he said was the example of Russia!</p>


<p>
There are no forces of resistance in the old system in these countries. Thus the magnificent movement of history takes place on the peripheral weak links of the Capitalist system. All mankind, in a sense, benefits by these changes. But it would be a horrible betrayal to see in these regimes the authentic visage of Socialism. Under conditions of backwardness they cannot be but a horrible caricature, especially where there is no independent movement of the proletariat. Neither the bourgeoisie nor the Stalinist bureaucracy regards them with the dread which it would reserve for a healthy proletarian revolution,
These battles, important as they are, are only the first skirmishes of the proletarian world revolution. They increase its reserves. But they develop insoluble contradictions of their own on a higher level than formerly.
Once the decisive battle is joined in the metropolitan centres the world situation will change completely. A victory in Japan or Britain or any other of the highly developed metropolitan areas would transform the world situation completely. Not excluded of course is the political revolution in Eastern Europe and Russia. That too would be decisive for all mankind. A regime of workers&#8217; democracy with full liberties and a semi-state, rather than totalitarian control would act as a beacon to the whole of the World. The capitalist regimes would fall like ninepins. A Socialist Europe, Japan and America would then lead Asia, Africa and Latin America direct to Communism in a World Federation.</p>


<p>
This is the perspective which must be at the back of the work of all the cadres in all the countries of the world. Outside this perspective there is no way out for the backward areas of the world, and indeed for all humanity.</p>

<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-1" name="foot-1">(1)</a></sup> The Bourbons were the
ruling dynasty in France until the revolution (1792). They were
briefly restored from 1830-48. In Spain the Bourbons ruled almost
continuously from 1700-1931. It is used here to describe leaders
who learn little or nothing from history.</p>

Iraq&#8217;s prime minister in 1958 after leading an army coup. The
Kurds are the major population group in Kurdistan, an area

Kurds are an oppressed national minority.</p>


<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-4" name="foot-4">(4)</a></sup> Kwame Nkrumah was Prime
Minister of Ghana on independence (1957), became president in
1960 until 1966 when he was overthrown by a military coup. Ahmed
Ben Bella was elected Prime Minister of Algeria on independence
(1962) and became president in 1963 until he was overthrown in
1965.</p>


<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-5" name="foot-5">(5)</a></sup> The Pakistan
constitutions of 1956 and 1962 were both replaced by martial law.</p>


<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-6" name="foot-6">(6)</a></sup> The main workers&#8217; party
of Sri Lanka in the late 1940s, 50s and 60s was the Lanka Sama
Samaja Party. Originally a Trotskyist party, it degenerated,
entered a coalition with the bourgeois SLFP, and by the mid-1970s
had lost its mass support.</p>


<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-7" name="foot-7">(7)</a></sup> In 1956 the workers in
Hungary rose up against the ruling bureaucracy. In six weeks they
organised two general strikes and two insurrections. They were
eventually defeated by the intervention of Russian tanks.</p>

<p><sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-11" name="foot-11">(11)</a></sup> With the defeat of
the German occupation forces in 1944, the workers in France and
Italy moved in a revolutionary direction. The Communist Parties
entered into &#8220;national unity&#8221; governments which were used by the
ruling class to diffuse the workers&#8217; movement. Once the immediate
danger had passed, the CPs were jettisoned from the cabinets.</p>
