<p class="fst">
The highest
unemployment figures in August since the war, more than 550,000 out of work; that
has been the consequence of carrying out capitalist policies by the government.
It is expected that by January or February the total will reach nearly
three-quarters of a million. A cold and bleak prospect for millions of men,
women and children.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
the British economy remains sick and ailing. The deflationary measures dictated
by the CBI and the banks have not solved the problems which face Britain.
Prices have continued to rise, while unused capacity to produce goods has
increased. Despite the lavish handouts to big business, investment has
continued to decline. Capitalists produce for profits not for the sake of
producing goods. The recent speech of Gunter could have been made by any Tory
minister, industrialist or banker. 
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;It is only the expansion of our industry that can in
the end prevent even more unemployment. I do wish so many of our comrades would
stop equating profits with incest or lechery.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;If you have a profitable industry you have the means
for further investment, further development and more jobs. If you have an
unprofitable industry you do not expand and you do not get more jobs.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
For a
hundred years socialists have been pointing out that the profits made by the
capitalists come from the unpaid labour of the working class. The capitalists
have become more and more parasitic. From the labour of the workers and the
exploitation of the colonial peoples they have piled up immense wealth. But on
a capitalist basis this wealth can only be further increased by squeezing still
more profit relatively from the workers. Hence the welcome by &ldquo;private
industry&rdquo; for the speech by the Minister of Labour.
</p>
<p>
It follows
from the policy of the government. Step by step they have been compelled to
abandon the policies on which they were elected. In the same speech, without
even realising the irony, while screaming for higher profits for the
capitalists to &ldquo;induce&rdquo; them to invest, Gunter gave an indication that the
social services are to be cut, and a form of means test introduced. Like the
hypocritical capitalists who are always weeping about those in the &ldquo;greatest
need&rdquo;, &ldquo;there is no cold inhumanity in testing and probing the way and the
manner in which vast sums are paid in such benefits,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Should such
benefits as family allowances and housing subsidies be paid to those whose
financial position make them unnecessary? Or, alternatively, should not the
available resources be concentrated on those in the greatest need?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
This
probably explains the resignation of Margaret Herbison from the Cabinet, and the
resignation of Robert Willis from the prices and incomes board. Without clearly
understanding the reasons, they have seen that the policies of the government
in more stringent fashion, have followed in the wake of those of the Tories.
</p>
<p>
In addition
to the lavish handouts to private industry, first freezing and now limiting
wage increases the government are introducing an &ldquo;Enabling Act&rdquo; to give them
the right to invest in private firms to assist modernisation. Big business and
the state are to be more and more tied together. The CBI is approaching this
suggestion gingerly and hesitantly. They are afraid it might turn out to be a
two-edged weapon. They have accepted every concession of the government, only
to ask for more. They are hesitating over this proposed concession because of
the possible implications.
</p>
<p>
While the
TUC is opposing the suggested means test they have welcomed the introduction of
an &ldquo;Enabling Act&rdquo;. But workers in the labour movement must ask their leaders
why stop there? Attlee in 1934 in his book <i>Labour
in perspective</i> suggested a blanket Enabling Act to take all the necessary
measures to nationalise the economy, in the interests of the working people.
The labour and trade union movement have the necessary strength and the
necessary support to take such measures.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
the miners, dockers, printers, cotton workers are all coming into conflict with
the measures of the government. Their interests are being sacrificed to those
of their employers and big capital generally. The hypocrisy of Gunter is
indicated by the fact that one fifth of the workers, the labourers and
unskilled sections of the workers, in sweated trades such as catering, are
earning less than they could get on national assistance, counting the amount
they would receive with allowances and family allowances for their wives and
children.
</p>
<h4>Means test for bosses</h4>
<p class="fst">
In the
reign of the first Elizabeth the parish, by law, made up the wages of the
agricultural labourers up to the bare subsistence level, where their wages were
below this miserable level. In the reign of the present Elizabeth, an
&ldquo;incentive&rdquo; is provided for the labourers to continue working; this to be done
by cutting down national assistance should they become unemployed, where this
would amount to more than they receive at work. Here is an opportunity for
Gunter, and the Labour government to insist on a national minimum. The TUC has
adopted the demand for a national minimum wage of &pound;15. How about an Enabling
Act making this compulsory, and abolishing the extreme exploitation of women by
introducing equal pay for equal work? Why not make speeches against the
sweatshop capitalists, and probing and testing the inhumanity of those
capitalists, especially in unorganised industries who pay starvation wages,
below the minimum? If there is to be a means test let it be to the capitalists
who have been paid over and over again for the ruined nationalised industries:
the latest example being steel.
</p>
<p>
Why
subsidise inefficient employers? If the capitalists cannot guarantee a decent
standard of living to the working people, the problem will not be solved by
nursing them. That merely increases the misery, anxiety and worries for
millions while not solving the problem of the economy. More and more schemes,
subsidies, rake-offs and bribery for the capitalists do not solve anything. The
squeeze has resulted in unemployment, while failing to induce the capitalists
to invest more in modern machinery. &ldquo;Deflationary&rdquo; policies of taxation have
merely worsened the position of British capitalism on world markets. There has
been a &ldquo;windfall&rdquo; in the fall in the price of raw materials. But that will mean
new storms among the oppressed colonial peoples, and a decreased market for
goods. Devaluation would be a temporary shot in the arm, like opium, but would be
followed by devaluation by Britain&rsquo;s competitors. So neither inflation nor
deflation can solve ailing British capitalism&rsquo;s problems. In addition
devaluation would mean a cut in real wages for the workers by the inevitable
increase in prices, if with some delay.
</p>
<p>
Entry or
non-entry into the Common Market poses the same problems. It would ruin
sections of industry, create unemployment, while furthering the interests of
the bankers and the biggest monopolies and the most modern industries and
trades. In any case the problem has been posed too late, even for the purposes
of the capitalists. The Common Market countries are beginning to move in a more
nationalist direction as the general fall of profits in relation to investments
begins to affect them. The English sickness, is spreading to Germany and other
Common Market countries.
</p>
<p>
After
generations of leaning on the backs of the miners, this section of the
population, in whole areas is to be left derelict by capitalism. The
shipbuilding industry and the docks are to be treated in the same fashion.
</p>
<p>
While all
this is happening the &ldquo;practical&rdquo; men of the TUC are considering a &ldquo;plan&rdquo; for
the next 30 years, to deal with the effects of further automation of industry.
This is to gaze at a mirage while falling into a ditch. Increased production
will mean more unemployment, as the automation plan for the docks shows. Yet
there could be an abundance for all. An Enabling Act to nationalise the 380
monopolies, the banks and the insurance companies while &ldquo;probing&rdquo; and &ldquo;testing&rdquo;
the compensation needed for reasonable standards for the capitalists would be
the start of a new era. It is this that makes the CBI uneasy about Enabling
Acts. A democratic socialist plan of production drawing in the unions, the
working class technicians, scientists, women workers and housewives, mobilising
the enthusiasm of the youth, is the only way out for the working class.
</p>
<h4>Mobilise the workers</h4>
<p class="fst">
A
democratic socialist Britain would transform the situation nationally and
internationally. There is no other way forward for the labour movement.
</p>
<p>
Capitalist
policies can only lead to new disasters like the council elections. To mobilise
the working people they must be given a perspective for them and their
children. Then even the most downtrodden and inert would rally to the standard
of the labour movement.
