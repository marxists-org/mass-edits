Compare   this meeting with the gatherings of the Communist International in its early   years. These proceeded from the basis that the enemy of the working class was   the capitalist classes of all countries. Not from sentiment, but because of   the international foundations laid by capitalism &#8211; as explained by Marx   in the last century &#8211; the interests of the workers of all countries were   the same, consequently the need for the international organisation of the working   class. Meetings of the Communist International were called to discuss the theoretical   and practical problems of overthrowing European and world capitalism. The conference   was regarded as a meeting place of one international party to discuss the ways   and means of doing this, and the special problems facing different countries,   especially the big countries of Western Europe, and primarily to find the road   to a United Socialist Europe. Consequently they were regarded with fear and   horror by the capitalists of the world, especially Western Europe.</p><p>  Contrast the situation today! Although Capitalism has been overthrown in Eastern   Europe (even though totalitarian one party systems have been set up) this Conference   is regarded with complacence by the Western European and international capitalists.   It is a conference not of one international party but of separate parties, both   in the countries where power has been seized, and in the countries of Western   Europe.</p><p>  The Greek representative, speaking of the army coup stressed the need for the   &#8216;neutrality&#8217; of Greece from West Germany and America! As if it was   not a question of landlordism and capitalism setting up this criminal Bonapartist   dictatorship for fear of the Greek workers and peasants. As if it was not a   question of organising the Greek people for the overthrow of this regime and   calling for the support of the workers of the world for a struggle for a Socialist   Greece.</p><p>  John Gollan, the General Secretary of the &#8216;British&#8217; party spoke   like the other delegates, not from the outlook of internationalism but as a   Britisher representing &#8216;British&#8217; interests. The Morning Star of   April 26th reports proudly how Gollan spoke at length:</p><p class="quoteb">  &#8220;The British Government far from taking a firm stand against the revenge-seeking   aims of the West German Government, is evasive about the Oder-Neisse frontier,   and refuses to make a categorical and complete denunciation of the Munich agreement.   Despite the heavy expenditure entailed, the British Government maintains troops   in West Germany.&#8221;</p><p class="quoteb">  &#8220;Mr. Gollan said this was &#8216;not to fulfil any post-war pledge of   preventing the emergence of fascism again, nor to save Europe from a mythical   &#8216;Soviet threat&#8217;.&#8217;</p><p class="quoteb">  &#8220;The aim was in effect &#8216;to support the West German Government with   its military ambitions against other European States.&#8217;</p><p class="quoteb">  &#8220;He declared that the big West German monopolies hoped to make use of   the European Common Market as an economic counter-part of Nato. &#8216;They   hope that just as NATO has given them the opportunity to become the major military   power in Western Europe, so the Common Market will give them the chance to become   Western Europe&#8217;s major economic power.&#8217;</p><p class="quoteb">  &#8216;But for Britain, entry into the Common Market would mean a serious worsening   of the economic position of the British working people. It would also deepen   the divisions between East and West and to make more difficult the steps to   achieve European security...&#8217;</p><p class="quoteb">  &#8216;We are for all measures which lessen tension, lead to ending the present   divisions, and remove the dangers of military adventures by West Germany&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>  As if the last World [War] was not only the responsibility of the German, but   of the French, British, American and other capitalists as well. As if NATO is   not organised for the defence of all the capitalist powers in this alliance   including the British capitalists. As if &#8216;tension&#8217; between East   and West is not caused by the fundamental differences in social systems.</p><p>  The way to fight West German and British and other European capitalist militarism   is to fight against capitalism at home and to extend the hand of friendship   to the West German working class, the first victims of the Nazis.</p><p>  The British capitalists are trying to enter the Common Market in the interests   of British not German monopoly capitalism. The present divisions in Europe are   insane. The forces of production have long outgrown both private ownership and   the national state. The Common Market is not a solution. But the present position   also cannot solve a single problem facing British capitalism either at home   or abroad. The solution would not be entry into the Common Market but the democratic   Socialist United States of Europe.</p><p>  But Socialist solutions are furthest from the minds of the leaders of British   Communism. Dealing with the forthcoming Budget on April 8th, J.R. Campbell,   one of the principal &#8216;theoreticians&#8217; of the C.P., in a leading article   entitled &#8220;How To Get Out of Stagnation Street&#8221; criticises the Chancellor   James Callaghan as being &#8220;among the high priests of financial orthodoxy&#8221;.   The article could have been written by a Keynesian capitalist economist. There   is nothing about Socialism in it. He begins by saying: &#8220;The Budget presented   by Mr. Callaghan should be judged by whether it reduces or prolongs the present   stagnation in the British capitalist economy...&#8221; He then proceeds with   the typical arguments produced by the Labour leaders in their criticism of Tory   policy before they came to power. &#8220;So the over-all demand of the Labour   Government should be that the Government takes steps to reflate the economy.&#8221;</p><p>  Militant painstakingly explained to the Labour leaders before they came to power   that inflation and deflation are only two sides of the same coin. That while   380, now even less, combines and monopolies, together with the banks and insurance   companies, control 80% of the economy and nine-tenths of the productive economy,   the laws of the market apply, and no matter their intentions the Labour leaders   are compelled to operate on &#8216;orthodox&#8217; capitalist lines. That the   capitalists operated on the basis of the maximum production which could produce   profits for them.</p><p>  Yet here we have this pretended &#8216;Marxist economist&#8217; declaring &#8220;In   fact, it is the policy of creating stagnation from time to time which prevents   the really necessary changes in the British economy from being carried out.&#8221;   If Marx read this he would laugh his head off at this pseudo-Keynesianism, if   he did not get thoroughly angry at &#8216;Marxism&#8217; of this kind. Capitalists   do not create stagnation because they like it. Nor do capitalist governments   control the economy. It is the economy which dictates policy to them.</p><p>  Practically every paragraph commits elementary errors against the ideas of Marxist   economics, or Socialist policies. For example the SET tax should go and instead...   &#8220;There is only one way out of this situation, and that is to identify   the main unnecessary imports and reduce them by selective import quotas...&#8221;   Any student of economics, even capitalist economics, could explain that this   would be even worse for the economy than the measures taken by Callaghan. Campbell   forgets the world market on which Britain depends. If Britain introduced selective   import quotas, all the other capitalist powers would answer with reprisals and   the British economy would be in an even worse position.</p><p>  But what a position for a Marxist paper and a Marxist writer to put forward!   &#8216;Practical&#8217; policies which land the working class in a mess (of   which Lenin was most scornful) instead of upholding the banner of Socialist   principles!</p><p>  Campbell finishes his article by saying &#8220;And please, please, please don&#8217;t   let&#8217;s have any ugly cant about measures which attack the people being   &#8216;tough but necessary&#8217;. They are usually a cowardly and unnecessary   surrender to vested interests and a betrayal of the principles of the working-class   movement.&#8221; No better comment could be made on this article of Campbell's.</p><p>  The criticism on Callaghan is the criticism in the main made by Wilson of the   budgets of Maudling and Selwyn Lloyd. There is not an atom of Socialist or Marxist   perspective in them. No attempt is made to explain to the workers the need for   Socialist policies.</p><p>  Just to finish off and show the degeneration of the Communist Party, Will Paynter,   General Secretary of the National Union of Miners is quoted approvingly in the   capitalist press as well as in the April 8th edition of the Morning Star making   a savage and unwarranted attack on the miners. He is a leader of the Communist   Party yet can say re absenteeism, &#8220;Irresponsible antisocial behaviour,   represented by voluntary absences, especially on Mondays and Fridays, is the   other indefensible, element.&#8221; The agony of toil of the miners, the hardness   of the job, and all the other factors which have been emphasised by the Communist   Party in the past are forgotten. He wishes to ingratiate himself with the other   trade union bureaucrats and puts forward the position of the Right Wing. What   has this to do with Socialism or Marxism or even elementary trade union principle?</p><p>  No wonder the C.P. lost votes in the last council elections! They put forward   no real alternative to the leaders of the Labour Party. Every sincere YCL-er,   every sincere adult member of the Communist Party must see that there is something   wrong. They should fight for a Socialist policy in the Communist Party and prepare   to join the broad stream of the Labour Movement to fight for a Socialist Britain   in a Socialist Europe.</p>  <p class="skip">&nbsp;</p><hr class="end" /><p class="footer"><a href="../../index.htm">Ted GrantArchive</a></p></body></html>
