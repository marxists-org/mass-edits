<h4>Workers of the world unite!</h4>
<p>Two generations have passed since the November (Western
calendar) revolution in Russia of 1917. Two generations which have
seen two world wars, the rise and decline of Fascism in Western
Europe, the Great Slump of 1929, the uprising of the colonial
people against the old Empires, and the new technological
revolution in the highly industrialised countries since the end of
the Second World War. All these factors have increased immensely
the contradictions within capitalism, and between capitalism and
the third of the world where capitalism and landlordism have been
overthrown.</p>

<p>Hovering menacingly over mankind is the capacity to destroy
itself, with the development of nuclear and other frightful weapons
of war. On the other side is the possibility of immense abundance
and a fruitful and creative life for all the peoples of the
world.</p>

<p>The Russian Revolution is recognised now by even capitalist
sociologists and economists as the greatest event of this century.
In fact it marked the greatest event in world history. It cannot
<span class="inote">[be understood]</span> and was not understood by its real leaders, Lenin
and Trotsky, as a purely Russian event, but as the beginning of
the Socialist revolution on a European and world scale. Beginning
in one of the most backward countries in the world it looked
forward eagerly to being joined by the working class of the West.
The working class of Western Europe, the advanced layers of the
working class in all countries, looked towards Russia as a beacon
of advancement in the movement towards a better society and towards
Socialism.</p>

<p>International capital joined together with the defeated Russian
capitalists and landlords in a war of intervention, involving all
the great capitalist powers. They were forced to withdraw by the
protest movements of the working class and mutinies of the armies
and navies of intervention.</p>

<p>The aims of the revolution were simple and clear. They had been
worked out theoretically by Marx. Rule by the working class, as a
step towards Socialism. From the beginning, a higher form of
democracy than under capitalism. This involved the rule of the
Soviets, spontaneously set up <span class="inote">[by]</span> the workers during the course of the
revolution. These Soviets were committees of factory workers,
peasants, housewives, democratically and freely elected. This was
to replace the capitalists&#8217; state machine. No official was to
receive higher pay than that of a skilled worker. In place of a
standing army was to come the armed people. Instead of a
bureaucratic hierarchy, gradually all jobs in the administration of
the state, were to be done by everyone in turn. Thus when everyone
was a &#8220;bureaucrat&#8221; no one could be a bureaucrat. In Lenin&#8217;s
aphorism &#8220;every cook should be able to be Prime Minister&#8221;. These
aims were <span class="inote">[present at]</span> the beginning of the revolution.</p>

<p>However, the revolution in Germany and the revolutionary
situation in Western Europe did not reach fruition, for many
reasons <span class="inote">[for]</span> which there is no space in this article to explain.
The revolution remained isolated in a backward country. Gradually
power was usurped out of the hands of the workers and peasants, by
the millions of officials, by the bureaucracy. This was expressed
in the rise to power of Stalin with the &#8220;theory&#8221; of Socialism in
one country.</p>

<p>Just before his death Lenin had formed a bloc with Trotsky to
fight the growing power of the bureaucracy in the State and the
Party. The Left Opposition was formed with a programme of
internationalism and industrialisation on the basis of Five Year
Plans. It was no accident that Stalin and the bureaucracy opposed
the plan as Utopian. They reflected the blind forces of the
reaction against the revolution. Later after the defeat of the
Opposition, in caricature form the plan was to be adopted.</p>

<p>On the basis of State ownership and the planning of production,
dazzling results were achieved, despite the dead hand of the
bureaucracy. But with the growth of production grew the appetites
of the ruling clique. They defended the new form of production, of
planning and the nationalisation of industry and the
collectivisation of agriculture. But the original aims of the
revolution were abandoned. Not one of the conditions worked out by
Lenin remains in existence today. A bloody purge was begun against
the Old Bolsheviks who had carried out the revolution. Hundreds of
thousands were murdered and millions exiled to Siberia. Stalin
carried out a political counter-revolution, but on the basis of the
economic gains of the revolution.</p>

<p>The Communist International was transformed into an instrument
of Russian foreign policy. The policy of the leaders of the
Communist Party in Germany, aided by the Social-Democratic leaders
led to the victory of Hitler, the defeats of the Spanish Revolution
and the movement of the French working class. Thus the way was
prepared for the outbreak of the Second World War.</p>

<p>In Russia itself, the purges wiped out the overwhelming majority
of the officer cadres of the Red Army and Stalin tried to placate
Hitler. Despite warnings of an attack by trustworthy agents and
despite the movement of German troops towards the frontiers of
Russia, Stalin refused to act. At the beginning of the war the
fire-power of the Russian army was greater than that of the German
army, but in the first attack 95 percent of Russia&#8217;s planes were
destroyed on the ground. Timoshenko, Voroshilov and Budyenny were
creatures of Stalin but incapable generals. After the first
defeats, they had to be replaced. Hitler seized the most
industrialised areas of the Soviet Union. The war in Europe was
largely a struggle between Russia and Nazi Germany. Russia
established factories behind the Urals concentrated on arms
production, and outproduced Hitler who had almost the entire
resources of Europe at his disposal. This was due to the
superiority of State ownership and planning. Russia emerged
victorious from the war, through the self-sacrifice of the masses
and at a cost of 20 million lives.</p>

<p>With the rapid building up of production, the differentiation
between the masses on one side and the managers, generals, party
bureaucrats, and state officials, on the other, grew greater and
greater, and with it the dissatisfaction of the workers and
peasants. In 1953 Stalin prepared for a new purge, in order to
consolidate his rule. Earlier the people who had carried through
the revolution had been denounced as fascist agents, while they
were replaced in many cases by White Guards officials, such as
Maisky, the Russian Ambassador in Britain. Now a new &#8220;plot&#8221; was
conceived: the &#8220;doctors&#8217; plot&#8221; to kill Stalin. Conveniently at this
moment Stalin died. The tops of the bureaucracy feared the effects
of a new purge personally and for the economy. Thus they clearly
decided to get rid of Stalin.</p>

<p>In 1956 at the 20th Congress of the so-called Russian Communist
Party, which had become a tool of the bureaucracy, Khrushchev made
his revelations of the crimes of Stalin, which were declared to be
due to the &#8220;cult of personality&#8221;. But dictatorial regimes must
reflect social crises, and not the whims of one man, be he a Hitler
or a Stalin! The real reason for the denunciation of Stalin was the
political crisis in the Soviet Union due to the effects of
bureaucracy, and fear of a movement of the working class. It was a
reform from the top to prevent political revolution from below!</p>

<p>The slave camps in Siberia were disbanded. This was due as much
to the development of machine industry in the &#8220;Soviet&#8221; Union as to
sentiment for the victims of Stalin&#8217;s crimes. Forced labour is very
inefficient and expensive. Many of the Old Bolshevik victims of the
purges were rehabilitated. Whole peoples had been denounced by
Stalin, and men, women and children exiled to Siberia. Only
recently have the Tatar people of the Crimea belatedly been
exonerated from alleged collaboration with the Nazis, and given the
freedom to return to the Crimea if they wish.</p>

<p>However, the political dictatorship established by Stalin has
been retained. The bureaucracy, while making concessions to the
masses, has further reinforced the regime of inequality and
privilege. With the growth of production the bureaucracy has become
less and less a relatively progressive factor and more and more
become a fetter on production. In every sector, in industry,
science, technique and art, the bureaucratic stranglehold is
becoming more and more incompatible with the development of Russian
society.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the achievements (of which the recent sputnik sent to Venus is an example) are staggering. This is due entirely to state ownership and a plan, and in spite of the inefficiency and waste. Russia, from an underdeveloped country, has become the second industrial super-power of the world. She spends more on education per head of population than any other country of the world. Last year Russia produced nearly 100 million tons of steel. In the machine tool industry Russia has the highest production in the world. This means an even swifter advance in the future.</p>

<p>However, the regime of absolutism, though moderate in comparison
with the Stalin terror, remains intact. In a highly cultured
society and with the most educated working class in the world, this
becomes more and more a fetter on the development of society. 30 to
50 percent of production each year is wasted! Far from moving towards
Socialism, inequality and privilege are further reinforced.</p><table align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="15" width="35%">
  <tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#c0c0c0"><h4>Uprising of Russian Workers</h4><br />
Reports of a recent uprising in the Russian town of Chimkent, Kazakhstan, have, in the last month, crept into the Western press.<br/><br />
The <em>Guardian</em> 24/10/67 relates that &#8220;earlier reports said that the rioting began after the town police had beaten up a taxi driver&#8230; whom they had detained for a minor traffic offence. The driver died of his injuries&#8221;. As a result the report continues &#8220;large numbers of people joined the taxi drivers when they marched on the central police station to protest… but troops, tanks, and armoured cars had by then arrived from Tashkent about 75 miles and opened fire on them… The disturbances lasted well into the night&#8221;. As a reprisal the local <em>Kazakhstan Pravda</em> reported three of the leading participants were executed and an unspecified number jailed.<br /><br />
These reports, <em>never denied by the Government organs, nor for that matter the British &#8220;Communist&#8221; Party</em> sufficiently demonstrate the claim made in the article elsewhere that the corrupt totalitarian regime stands in stark relief to the democratic demands of the people. An indication of the undercurrent of popular indignation (which the <em>Guardian</em> maintains has been simmering for a while) is given by the fact that not only troops but tanks and armoured cars were deployed against the demonstrators. The methods of the present regime are reminiscent of the czarist police. They have nothing in common with the traditions of the Revolution of 50 years ago.

<p>The nationalist degeneration of an outmoded capitalism is
equaled by the nationalist degeneration of the Russian bureaucracy.
On this level the bureaucracy competes in the so called &#8220;Socialist&#8221;
world of Eastern Europe, with each national bureaucracy standing
for its own interests, with Stalinist China and Yugoslavia, and
competes with American imperialism in giving aid to the rotten tops
of the &#8220;undeveloped&#8221; world.</p>

<p>Just at the time when the &#8220;profit motive&#8221; in the West is showing
its bankruptcy, the bureaucrats, in order to give an &#8220;incentive&#8221; to
the bureaucratic management are introducing the profit motive as an
index for production, with an enormous rake-off for the managers,
because they can see no way out for the economy. In time this will
fail, as have the previous attempts at decentralisation,
recentralisation, and now a further decentralisation of industry.
The pace of production is increasing only by spurts, and the crisis
of the regime remains unsolved. The present five year plan will
largely be successful, but the social contradictions will be
further increased, despite the enormous increase in standards of
living in comparison with the past.</p>

<p>The shadow of the revolution still menaces the ruling stratum in
the Soviet Union. While paying lip-service, they dread the genuine
traditions of the revolution. The working class is becoming more
and more critical. Despite the successes, crisis racks the society.
It is a question of which will come first, social revolution in the
West, or political revolution in the East. The tradition of
October, of a movement towards equality, of steps in the direction
of Socialism and the dissolution of the State within society, still
remain, despite the filth collected in the last decades.</p>


<p>On new foundations, no longer with a working class of 4 million,
uneducated and illiterate in a backward country, but an industrial
society with a working class of 100 million, on the basis of state
ownership and planned production, the working masses will return to
the regime of workers&#8217; democracy established by Lenin and Trotsky.
Like the October revolution this would set up a chain reaction and
prepare the way for an international Socialist Federation of
States, for the purpose of planning production on an international
scale. Similarly, the reason why there can be a relative
d&eacute;tente between Russia and the West is that the bureaucracy
fears the overthrow of capitalism in any of the main capitalist
nations, which could only result in workers&#8217; democracy, because of
the effect it would have on the Russian workers. The revolution in
China and Eastern Europe began in the distorted form in which the
Russian revolution ended. This represented no direct threat to the
Russian bureaucracy or to world capitalism, except that the
capitalist world had shrunk. Social revolution in an advanced
country, like the political revolution in Hungary, represents the
beginning of the end for world capitalism as well as for the
national Stalinist bureaucracies in Asia and Europe.</p>
