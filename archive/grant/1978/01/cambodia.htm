<p class="fst">
Fighting on a 600-mile front between Vietnam
and Cambodia
has broken out. The battles have taken place for more than a week. Atrocities,
including the disembowelling of pregnant women and the butchery of men, women
and children by both sides have been reported by the radio broadcasts from Hanoi and Phnom
Penh. The Vietnamese used elements of six divisions
(60,000 men) to penetrate deep into Cambodia.
</p>
<h4>&ldquo;Impartial&rdquo;</h4>
<p class="fst">
The fighting has followed armed border clashes over the past two years.
More than 10,000 have been killed. Destruction of villages, cattle and rice in
these incidents are documented by the two sides. These have been clashes mainly
between peasants and peasant troops of both sides. But the ruling cliques in
control of both countries have encouraged these &ldquo;border&rdquo; disputes.
</p>
<p>
The imperialists and the capitalist press have received reports of the
fighting with jubilant delight. Imperialism, especially American imperialism,
had been discredited by the &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; wars of the last three decades. Now they
are delighted at the opportunity to discredit socialism and &ldquo;socialist
aggressor powers&rdquo;. Here are two &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; countries at &ldquo;war&rdquo; with each other
and settling differences in the language of bullets, bombs, warplanes and
machine guns.
</p>
<p>
In this situation, the position of the Communist Party is comical in the
extreme. They are wringing their hands in embarrassment, and piously declaiming
on the merits of negotiation and peace. But they give not a word of explanation
of how such a conflict can arise between what they call &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; countries
which are supposed to be democratically controlled by their peoples.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Morning Star</i>, at first
presented the war dispassionately as a &ldquo;news item&rdquo;&mdash;much as the press would
&ldquo;impartially&rdquo; report the spilling of marmalade in an accidental collision
between lorries in a road accident!
</p>
<p>
Now they have been compelled, by the obvious desire of their readers and
the members of the CP to find out what is happening and to know the attitude of
the CP leadership, to write an editorial on January 6<sup>th</sup> which
explains nothing, but piously calls for &ldquo;negotiations&rdquo;: &ldquo;All those who
participated in the world-wide movement of solidarity with the peoples of
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos in their heroic struggles against US imperialism
will want to express the hope that the present conflict on the Vietnam-Cambodia
border will be settled rapidly by negotiation.&rdquo; Naturally, having espoused Jingo
nationalism for decades, and as sedulous apologists for the Stalinist regimes
in Eastern Europe, they cannot do anything but regard borders arbitrarily and
brutally carved out by imperialism over the living bodies of the colonial
peoples, as unchangeable and sacrosanct. The frontiers of Indo-China were
artificially decided by French imperialism. Khmers live on both sides of the
Vietnam-Cambodia border. Vietnamese also live on both sides. The poison of
national chauvinism was injected by French imperialism with the classic and
brutal policy of &ldquo;divide and rule&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
This is now the second armed clash between countries which have eliminated
landlordism and imperialism. In the Horn of Africa, the undeclared war between Somalia and Ethiopia and the brutal suppression
of the Eritrean people by force of arms is still continuing.
</p>
<p>
How can countries which have eliminated the class contradiction of
landlordism and capitalism and have established &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; regimes be at war
with each other? The &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; parties are incapable of explaining this new
contradiction.
</p>
<p>
How and why has this happened? In reality, the explanation has long ago
been provided by the theory of Marxism, and the ideas of Lenin and Trotsky.
These are workers&rsquo; states but deformed workers&rsquo; states: bonapartist
regimes&mdash;i.e. military-police style dictatorships&mdash;resting not on private
ownership like the capitalist dictatorships but on state ownership of the means
of production.
</p>
<p>
These states are not healthy workers&rsquo; states and this means that there
are no trade unions, political parties (even those accepting state ownership)
independent of the state; nor are there soviets or workers&rsquo; committees. There
is no right to strike or organise, no press free from state control, nor any of
the rights won by hard struggle by the working class in the capitalist
democracies. There is only a one-party, bureaucratically controlled
military-police dictatorship.
</p>
<h4>Liberation</h4>
<p class="fst">
In spite of this, the overthrow of imperialism and the elimination of
the fetters of landlordism and capitalism marked an immense step forward by
these peoples. Domination by imperialism, capitalism and landlordism means only
unending misery, hunger and squalor, with no way forward. The dictatorial
capitalist, semi-feudal regimes offered not the smallest prospect of real
democratic rights or the economic development and industrialisation of these
areas.
</p>
<p>
That is why their collapse marked an immense step forward for their
peoples. It is one of the reasons why <i>Militant</i>
and its Marxist supporters gave wholehearted support to the wars of national
and social liberation against imperialism in South East
Asia and the Horn of Africa.
</p>
<p>
But we did so with our eyes open, honestly explaining, without the
smallest measure of deceit, the real process taking place. We explained all the
issues to the labour movement and the workers of Britain and the world, whom we
could reach.
</p>
<p>
While supporting the war, we explained the Stalinist character of the
leadership, the inevitable consequences this would have if they were
victorious, and the character of the regimes they would institute. At the same
time, we did not criticise in a negative manner, but put forward the
alternative of workers&rsquo; and peasants&rsquo; democracy, which existed in the first
days of the Russian revolution between 1917 and 1923, and was maintained even
in the wars of intervention which followed.
</p>
<p>
We defended the democratic rights of the workers and peasants while
supporting aid and action in favour of the overthrow of the dictatorial and
corrupt Thieu and other regimes in Indo-China.
</p>
<p>
With the policy of Lenin and Trotsky, of workers&rsquo; democracy and the
right of national self-determination, it would have been possible for the
peoples of Indo-China
voluntarily and freely to set up a Socialist Federation of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam,
linking such a federation to a genuine workers&rsquo; democracy in China and Russia. Such a free democratic
federation would have had an irresistible appeal to all the workers of Asia and the colonial world and also to the workers of
the industrialised capitalist world. This was Lenin&rsquo;s policy in Russia, which
led to the creation of the USSR&mdash;the
Union of Socialist
Soviet Republics.
The word &ldquo;Russia&rdquo;
does not appear in the name.
</p>
<p>
The problem of this epoch is not merely to destroy the fetters of
private property but also the narrow confines of the nation state, with maximum
rights of national self-determination and of workers&rsquo; democracy. Instead of
encouraging federation, the Stalinist states of China
and Russia
are dabbling in national antagonisms and trying to play off these countries
against each other, in the struggle between the bureaucratic rulers of these
two mighty countries. This is neither in the interests of the peoples of these
countries nor of the peoples of China
and Russia.
It is a blow against the struggle of the working class throughout the world to
achieve its emancipation from the shackles of capitalism.
</p>
<h4>New struggle</h4>
<p class="fst">
As an aside, history is always harsh to the political buffoons of the
self-styled &ldquo;Marxist&rdquo; sects on the fringes of the labour moment. All of them
slavishly kow-towed to the Stalinists in China
and Indo-China,
as elsewhere, without criticism, explanation or perspectives. During the wars
of national and social liberation in South, East Asia they pretended&mdash;or what is
worse, thought&mdash;that what was undoubtedly a colossal step forward, the victory
over imperialism and landlord capitalism in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, would
mean &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; in these countries. In fact, the <i>Militant</i> explained well in advance&mdash;not belatedly, after the
event&mdash;that the peoples of these countries would have to pay with a new
revolution, a political, not social, revolution, before there could be the
installation of a workers&rsquo; democracy and a free socialist federation of these
peoples.
