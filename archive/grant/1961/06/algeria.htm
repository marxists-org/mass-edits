Using
the familiar cloak of &#8220;anti-Communism&#8221; four French Generals tried to seize
control of Algeria, as a preliminary to the capture of power in France. The
immediate cause of the attempted counter-revolution was an attempt to prevent
the French Government from negotiating an end to the Algerian War.
</p>
<p>
The
French Army since 1945 has been waging continuously a series of colonial wars,
in which the French Imperialists have been forced in the end to withdraw or
make concessions to the movement for national liberation from foreign
oppression. Thus in the eyes of the officer caste and the toughs of the
Paratroops and Foreign Legion, professional mercenaries, all their sacrifices
and struggles have been in vain. In every case they have been forced in the
end, despite superiority of weapons, to give ground to the desire for national
freedom. In their eyes the &#8220;politicians&#8221; in Paris have &#8220;betrayed&#8221; them. Hence
their hatred for &#8220;democracy&#8221; and &#8220;the whore of a republic&#8221; which has had to
give way before the pressure of the colonial peoples and the war-weariness of
the French people, at the endless series of wars.
</p>
<p>
The
uprising of 1958 had brought de Gaulle to power. He had been supported by Big
Business as a means of centralising power in their interests, pushing parliament
to occupy a secondary role. But the liberties and rights of the workers
remained largely intact.
</p>
<p>
Now the
army generals reason, why should they not be able to repeat the trick of 1958?
In the last few years it has been a &#8220;secret&#8221; to nobody that a continuous series
of plots has been evolved by the officers and generals in the French Army. The
Lagaillairde uprising in Algiers was based on the assumption that the &#8220;Army,&#8221;
i.e. the officer caste, would support it.
</p>
<p>
As in the
Spain of 1936 before the Franco uprising warnings of conspiracy appeared in the
workers&#8217; press in France. Of course the &#8220;Security Services&#8221; and de Gaulle
himself have been well aware of this. &#8220;Postings&#8221; of generals, colonels and
other officer ranks from Algeria, principally to the army in Western Germany,
have been de Gaulle&#8217;s answer. So the Popular Front Government had behaved in
Spain when faced with a similar problem. Franco was moved from one of the
military posts in one of the principal Spanish towns to his command in Morocco.
There in this game of &#8220;musical chair&#8221; reshufflings he had prepared for the
fascist insurrection.
</p>
<h4>Nature of the state</h4>
<p class="fst">
Why did the
Government as the pre-war Popular Front Government in France and Spain do nothing
decisive to prevent the insurrection? Against the whinings of the leaders of
the Socialist Party and the so-called Communist Party in France one can only
counter-pose the arguments of Marx and Lenin on the <em>nature of the state</em>. They have pointed out that the state, in the
last resort, can be reduced to <em>armed bodies
of men</em> and their appendages. The ruling class relies on the <em>officer caste</em>, specially trained and
selected, to ensure its dominance in society. For the Government, which in
capitalist society must always be the executive of the ruling class, to take action
against the officer caste, would be like to saw off the branch of a tree on
which one was supported. It would be to leave them at the mercy of the masses.
</p>
<h4>&#8220;National&#8221; feelings</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
&#8220;patriotic&#8221; Generals, as with Franco who used the Moors and foreign troops
against his own people, did not hesitate to use foreign mercenaries to try and
gain control of the French state. So much for their &#8220;national&#8221; feelings.
</p>
<p>
The
uprising collapsed ingloriously after a few days. The total casualties were 10
wounded and two killed.
</p>
<h4>The biggest strike!</h4>
<p class="fst">
Why was the
attempted counter-revolution so feeble? The French masses reacted with the
demonstration strike of one hour. Twelve million people responded. It was the
biggest general strike in history. Not only the industrial workers came out,
but the teachers, postmen, civil servants and even the bank clerks! The
overwhelming majority of the French people were against this attempt of the
French generals to take France over on a programme of dictatorship and colonial
war.
</p>
<p>
However the
overwhelming majority of the French people were against the insurgents in 1958,
but that did not prevent the handing of power to de Gaulle by the &#8220;Republican&#8221;
Government.
</p>
<p>
In the
first hours of the uprising it was obvious that the de Gaulle Government was
not sure of the loyalty of the &#8220;Army&#8221; not only in Algeria but in Western
Germany and even of the officers commanding the garrisons in France. The French
people showed an immense &#233;lan and willingness to resist. The general strike was
supported by the Socialist, Catholic and Communist unions. The unorganised
workers responded as magnificently and unanimously to the strike appeal as the
organised members of the unions. The spectre of civil war hung over France.
This, of course, would have stayed the hand of the generals, as little as it
did Franco.
</p>
<h4>Uniforms not arms</h4>
<p class="fst">
But in
spite of the mortal peril of the first days it is significant that <em>the de Gaulle Government was afraid to arm
the workers</em> for fear of losing control out of the hands of the capitalist
class. In the first hours, some Ministers in the Government issued an appeal
for volunteers. Thousands responded, and the workers in the factories were
clamouring for arms. The volunteers on the first night of the uprising were
issued with uniforms but&#8230; no arms! Debre the Prime Minister appealed to the
unarmed population, in the event of paratroops dropping on Paris to &#8220;reason&#8221; in
mass with the tough thugs and cut-throats of the Foreign Legion paratroops!
Hardly an effective resistance!
</p>
<p>
The second
day of the uprising saw a countermanding and second thoughts at the idea of
issuing arms to &#8220;unauthorised people&#8221;. The correspondent of <em>The Times</em> revealed the real fears of the
ruling class, whether it be French, German, British or any other of any armed
force not under its direct control. In its issue of April 26<sup>th</sup> it
said, &#8220;Not the least of the spectacular and disquieting events in France in
reaction to the Algiers mutiny has been the confused and fervent formation over
the past two days of what are officially known as &#8216;civil defence Groups in
support of de Gaulle&#8217;.&#8221; According to <em>The
Times</em> the volunteers were predominantly &#8220;manual workers&#8221;.
</p>
<h4>Resistance</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
real reason for the collapse of the insurrection was the reaction of the French
masses, especially the conscripts! Challe was threatening Paris with a
non-existent army! The overwhelming majority of the conscript soldiers were
against him. Almost from the start they began to organise resistance.
</p>
<p>
Reports and
letters later published in the press both Conservative and Communist indicate
this. <em>Le Monde</em>, the <em>Times</em> of France, wrote on May 5<sup>th</sup>,
&#8220;We are beginning to learn of the major role played by the conscripts, not only
in openly demonstrating their loyalty, but in paralysing the entire military
machine&#8230;&#8221; <em>L&#8217;Humanite</em>, the organ of
the Communist Party, published many extracts of letters from soldiers to their
relatives.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Conscripts organised strikes and sit-down, organised
united refusal to obey fascist officers, sabotaged communications, vehicles,
and in some cases even of military operations&#8230;In many units the conscripts
organised their own discipline and replaced the traitor officers by men from
the ranks&#8230;Conscripts occupied the aerodrome of Ain-Amat and struck work for a
whole day to prevent officers from joining Challe. Paratroops were chased, from
Telergama Airfield&#8230;Setif&#8230;Many officers, including a general wanted to turn
traitor. Discovering this the conscripts of the 69<sup>th</sup> refused to obey
their orders&#8230;Algiers&#8230;The presses printing Army propaganda were stopped to print
leaflets prepared by us calling on the men to disobey the fascists.&#8221; 
</p>
<p class="fst">
A leaflet
issued by the soldiers in Blida Air base, &#8220;Sunday morning when the commander
called us together to tell us that he was going over to Challe, we all left the
hail. We forced the paratroops who had occupied the headquarters to leave,
drove them out of the hangars and put in their place our own protection groups.
On Monday we prevented the departure of any plane&#8230;&#8221; Bone. &#8220;The officers, having
shown they were in agreement with the rebellion, they were placed under arrest
by the soldiers and a conscript Second Lieutenant took command.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
These
incidents could be multiplied a thousand times. The pilots refused to fly the
planes to carry paratroops and many deserted with their planes to France. Even
the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>,
arch-Conservative paper, was forced to admit &#8220;Many of them (conscripts)
sabotaged the paratroopers&#8217; supplies and transport, putting water into fuel
tanks&#8230;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
That
was the decisive factor in the revolt which turned it into such an inglorious
fiasco.
</p>
<h4>Soviets formed</h4>
<p class="fst">
The main
lesson for active layers of the Labour movement lies in indicating that even at
a time of &#8220;prosperity&#8221; capitalism still shows the barbarism and reaction
lurking within its depths. The inevitable onset of &#8220;hard times&#8221; will once again
bring out all the reactionary aspects of capitalism. Hitler, Mussolini and
Franco were not accidents but expressions of capitalism in decline. So Challe
is not only a French phenomenon. Under difficult conditions British Challes can
also arise.
</p>
<p>
In all this
the complete impotence and treachery of the French Communist party &#8220;leaders&#8221; is
manifest. Lenin wrote that an incident like the Dreyfus affair, demonstrating
the rottenness and corruption of the French Army and State, could be the
occasion of revolution. Events like these could shake the masses out of their
customary torpor and show them the need for the Socialist Revolution. In France
the soldiers have formed committees or to call them by another name <em>Soviets</em>. The French Army Officers in Germany
remained passive only for fear of the reaction of the ranks. The ruling class
thus had a broken stick on which to lean if the masses moved into action. If
the leadership of the working class, understanding the situation, exposed the
rottenness of French capitalist society offered a Socialist alternative, France
would now be in a pre-revolutionary situation.
</p>
<h4>The answer</h4>
<p class="fst">
R. Palme
Dutt the &#8220;theoretician&#8221; of the Communist Party has compared the revolt,
correctly, to the revolt of Kornilov in Russia, in 1917. But that prepared the
way for the Socialist Revolution in Russia. If that is not so in France the
reason lies in the degeneration and betrayal of the leadership of the French
Communist Party.
</p>
<p>
However,
events in France, as elsewhere, will teach the masses that there is no final
solution of their problems other than the taking of power by the working class.
