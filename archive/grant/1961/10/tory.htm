Labour once again faces a turning point in the political
situation in this country. The policies of Tory capitalism have landed the
country into a new economic crisis, where the only remedy of the Tory
witchdoctors is to bleed the victim in the new economic squeeze, for the
benefit of their millionaire paymasters. The wage freeze hits at the worst-paid
sections of the working class, and at big layers of the middle class and
professional people as well. At the same time the Tories shamelessly subsidise
the rich with their lessened taxes on surtax and big incomes. The contrast of
this vicious class policy is glaring, the gilt on the &ldquo;affluent society&rdquo; has
worn rather thin.
</p>
<p>
At the same time the confession of bankruptcy of British
capitalism is embodied in the abandonment of traditional British imperialist
policy, in the attempt to join the Common Market in Europe.
</p>
<p>
In the field of education, production and technique Britain
is lagging far behind her rivals. In a decade Britain threatens to become a
backward country if Tory policies are continued. She is rapidly becoming the
new &ldquo;sick man of Europe.&rdquo; Desperately the Tories are trying to stir the selfish
monopolies of big industry with the whip of competition from the Common Market.
</p>
<p>
The people as a whole under the impact of the Tory attacks
on teachers, post office workers and civil servants, as well as the general
wage freeze are becoming critical of the policy of the Tories and are looking
for an alternative. This is Labour&rsquo;s opportunity to win the support of the
overwhelming majority of the working class as well as wide sections of the
middle class. Labour can gain power if the leadership presses home the
advantage given by the situation.
</p>
<p>
However, a similar situation developed during the middle of
the last term of power of the Tories. The passivity of the leadership in not
offering the people a sharp and fundamentally different policy to the Tories
resulted in their recovery and the debacle of 1959.
</p>
<h4>What rank and file want</h4>
<p class="fst">
To gain power Labour must offer positive alternatives to the
policy of Tory &ldquo;affluence.&rdquo; If there is no great difference in policy the
un-political workers and the mass of the middle class will play safe and vote
for the devil they know rather than risk a change.
</p>
<p>
Only a socialist policy attacking all the evils of
capitalism and its lust for profits, which is the root cause of the present
difficulties, can find an echo among the workers. This is the policy which the
rank and file of the Labour Party want. Gaitskell has had his victory on
&ldquo;defence,&rdquo; where his policy does not diverge fundamentally from that of the
Tories. There can be no Labour victory on this question where the policies are
so much alike. But the right wing in the last 12 months has been silent on the
vital question of clause 4 and the decision to popularise the need for taking
over the commanding heights of the economy in the interests of the working
class. <em>Nothing has been done on this
decisive question</em>.
</p>
<p>
This year resolution after resolution from constituency
parties and from the unions has emphasised the need to nationalise the land,
engineering, banks, insurance and the building industry and the great bulk of
industry and commerce controlled by monopolies and big business; as well as
merely re-nationalising steel and road transport.
</p>
<p>
<em>This is merely
underlining the decisions taken last year which have not been implemented by
the leadership.</em> They were busily waging
war on the membership on the issue of defence, instead of carrying the war
against the Tories on this question.
</p>
<p>
At the same time in Parliament and in the country the
leadership has presented the shocking picture of equivocation and passivity on
the question of whether Britain should enter the Common Market or not. Whether
this is successful or not the Tories will use the silence of the Labour leaders
to devastating advantage in the next election. Not to put forward a policy on
this question is to make sure of further electoral victories for the Tories, if
new events do not intervene and change the mood of the people.
</p>
<p>
The right wing in reality wishes to follow meekly the Tories
in their efforts to enter but does not dare to declare themselves too openly.
Unfortunately the left wing has not put forward a real alternative to the
policy of British capitalism on this question. In effect they are trying to
maintain the position defended by the British capitalists in the past of
relative isolationism which history has rendered obsolete.
</p>
<h4>Isolation impossible</h4>
<p class="fst">
The only alternative is to show the impossibility of
maintaining this small island, separate and apart from Europe, but to explain
to the mass of the people that only a socialist Britain linked in a socialist
United States of Europe, can maintain and extend the standards of living gained
by the struggle of the trade union and labour movement. Only a socialist
Britain can introduce a real plan of production and integrate it with the
economy of a socialist Europe.
</p>
<p>
The Tories have confessed the bankruptcy of &ldquo;free
enterprise&rdquo; and &ldquo;Conservative freedom&rdquo; in their lip-service to planning. But
what dictates the development of the economy is not its needs but the
profitability to big business of production. If it does not pay they will
always cut down production. Even at the height of the boom there was &ldquo;surplus
capacity,&rdquo; i.e. the people could not buy back the goods which could be
produced. Hence the refusal to produce the goods, in the language of
capitalism, there was no market.
</p>
<h4>Capitalism impotent</h4>
<p class="fst">
The Labour leaders have not taken the offensive against the
Tories on this question, exposing the impotence of capitalism to plan and
organise production for the benefit of the people <em>Socialist Fight</em> supports the resolutions on the agenda which
express the real class aspirations of the Labour workers on the question of a
socialist policy at home and abroad. It indicates that nothing can change the
socialist heart of the labour movement. The desire of the members for a
socialist policy has become stronger than ever.
</p>
<p>
A radical policy in the climate of 1945 guaranteed
overwhelming victory for Labour. Only a socialist policy on the lines sketched
above can change society for the benefit of the people. It is the sole means of
guaranteeing peace and plenty at home and abroad.
</p>
<p>
Gaitskell&rsquo;s victory on defence will be a hollow one. More
and more the workers will demand a carrying out of socialist policies and an
acceptance of the will of the members as expressed in conference.
