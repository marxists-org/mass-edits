<p class="fst">
Two
divergent wings are beginning to develop inside the Labour Party. For the first
time since the war, we see the beginnings of a serious opposition which
portends a challenge to the policy adopted by the leadership. Fifty-seven M.P.s
voted against the Tory motion of endorsement for the rearmament programme. In
this, they reflect the deep dissatisfaction of the rank and file members of the
Trade Unions and the Labour Party with the policy of the official Labour
Movement, which trails behind that of British Imperialism and big business. In
tabling an amendment merely expressing doubts as to the capacity of the Tories
to carry out the rearmament programme, the Labour leaders revealed that there
was no essential difference between the Tory foreign policy and the one which <em>they</em> had carried out when in power. As
the <em>Times</em> of March 6<sup>th</sup>
commented on Attlee&#8217;s Parliamentary speech of the previous day:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;The
Opposition were all agreed that we must build up our defences. He frankly said
that there were differences about the extent. The Opposition were supporting
the provision which the Government proposed to make, but they were entirely
distrustful of the ability of the present Government to carry it out.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
In an
earlier debate. Churchill, with adroit tactics and malicious enjoyment,
protested in Parliament (<em>Times</em>,
February 27<sup>th</sup>) when defending himself against the charges of
war-mongering and of going too far in his statements to Congress &#8220;There is no
change in our policy towards the U.S., the United Nations, or the war in Korea.
Other circumstances might justify action not confined to Korea. We have <em>only followed and conformed</em> (our
emphasis) to the policy for which the late Government were responsible&#8230;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Quite
&#8220;unsportingly&#8221; he referred to secret agreements with the Americans, which had
been accepted by Morrison, Attlee and other Labour leaders without any
consultation with the Labour M.P.s, let alone the ordinary members of the
Labour Party. Naturally this disgusted large numbers of back benchers and the
rank and file. Attlee, Morrison and the other leaders in the Cabinet had been
saying one thing in public and committing themselves in secret diplomacy to the
opposite. This could not but arouse disquiet among the Labour supporters.
</p>
<h4>Labour leaders&#8217; quandary</h4>
<p class="fst">
In these
circumstances the Labour leaders, under pressure from the working class, found
they were in a quandary in attempting to differentiate themselves from
Tory-capitalist reaction. Hence the feeble amendment which Churchill derided as
ludicrous, coupled as it was with support of broad policy.
</p>
<p>
Against a
background of cuts, rising prices, health charges, increase in fares, the
burdens being imposed on the masses are resulting in the sweeping away of the
gains made in the first period of the post-war Labour Government. It is
frustration and worry over the gradual undermining of the workers&#8217; standards by
the Tories which has slowly been developing an explosive discontent
industrially and politically.
</p>
<h4>&#163;5,200 million Arms&#8217; Programme</h4>
<p class="fst">
At the same
time as these new sacrifices are being demanded from the masses in the name of
peace and security, a colossal burden of arms is being piled up. The White
Paper of February 21<sup>st</sup> estimated the expenditure on defence for the
year 1951-52 as &#163;1,131,500,000, and &#163;1,462,200,000 for the year 1952-53. From
the latter must be subtracted &#163;85,000,000 in American assistance, which leaves
&#163;1,377,200,000. The programme of the Labour Government, for the expenditure of
&#163;4,700,000,000 in three years, because of the rise in prices, would be equal to
&#163;5,200,000,000. Nevertheless the programme for 1952-53 which would have cost
&#163;1,500,000,000 at 1950 prices is to cost &#163;38,000,000 less at current price
levels, while costs have risen by about 10 percent. This represents a reduction
of 10 percent, on the original time schedule of three years.
</p>
<p>
Churchill
in Parliament pointed out, however, that the original programme is much more
likely to be carried out in four years rather than in three. This now means a
reduction of the rate of rearmament by 25 percent each year. Such a slowing
down has been imposed on the Government by the physical impossibility of
carrying out the original programme in the time scheduled and the danger of
economic collapse.
</p>
<p>
This burden
of militarism, of the state machine, threatens to devour a great part of the
fruits of the labour of the working class in re-building and re-equipping
British industry. The rearmament programme threatens to undermine the fabric of
Britain&#8217;s economy and the gains of the working class under the Labour
Government.
</p>
<h4>Bevan reflects discontent</h4>
<p class="fst">
However,
the gathering discontent of the workers was already being made manifest in the
Labour Party round the rearmament issue under the Labour Government itself.
This feeling was expressed and came into the open by the resignation of Bevan,
Freeman and Wilson from office. The inevitable opposition of the members to the
reactionary policies of the right wing found their vent in the pushing of Bevan
and other Labour M.P.s to the left.
</p>
<p>
The rank
and file of the Labour Party want a clear home and foreign programme which will
give them a socialist way out leading to peace, plenty and security for all.
The need for such cannot be filled by a one-sided stress of one or other
aspect, even of major policy. Home and foreign policy are indissolubly
connected. A clear stand on one cannot be obtained without a clear policy on
the other.
</p>
<p>
The revolt
of the fifty-seven M.P.s marks a stage in the necessary rearmament of the
Labour Party, if it is to fulfil the function for which it was formed:&#8212;to
secure the transformation of British society. It is the beginning of a struggle
against policies which are leading the Labour movement and the country to the
edge of catastrophe. In that sense it is a welcome reawakening of the socialist
consciousness of the Party.
</p>
<h4>Programme vague</h4>
<p class="fst">
Nevertheless
the Bevan programme is to a certain extent inconsistent. The cuts they
themselves suggested a year ago, in order, so they maintained, to avoid
crippling the economy, have been executed&#8212;and more&#8212;by the Tories, when they
reduced the arms rate. Thus Bevan and his friends have made this difference not
one of principle (in fact they have accepted most of the case for rearmament,
only objecting to the pace and scale on which it was to be carried out), but
purely one of arithmetic and practicality. As Tom Driberg said in <em>Reynolds News</em> (March 9<sup>th</sup>) of
the fifty-seven: &#8220;All of us (except the pacifists, whose position is understood
and respected) agreed that some rearmament was necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
In sober
fact, in accepting the whole basis for rearmament, without a fundamental
alternative from a social, political and economic standpoint, Bevan and the
M.P.s who support him are offering nothing but a milder version of Attlee&#8217;s
programme. Typical of this is Bevan&#8217;s article in the <em>Daily Mirror</em>, February 27<sup>th</sup>, 1952, where he says:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;There is nothing in this picture (capitalist greed
and mismanagement, shortage of food and raw materials) that would suggest that
the Labour Party should pause in its programme of transferring more industries
and services to public ownership. <em>On the
contrary evidence piles up to show that unrestricted pursuit of private gain is
opposed to any hope of reasonable progress in the material aspect of our lives.</em>&#8221;
(His emphasis.)
</p>
<p class="fst">
Into such a
programme one can read anything one wishes, it does not commit him to any
concrete measures due to its lack of clarity and precision. 
</p>
<h4>Fifty-seven not homogeneous</h4>
<p class="fst">
That the
Bevan movement is not clear on its programme is shown by the composition of the
fifty-seven M.P.s who voted with him. The <em>Times</em>
in their editorial of March 7<sup>th</sup>, 1952, assessing the opposition in
the Labour Party <em>from the capitalist
point of view</em> remarked on the fact that they are not a homogeneous
grouping:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;There
are pacifists and the survivors of the old I.L.P. tradition; the intellectuals,
like Mr. Crossman himself, whose views on foreign policy have chopped and
changed so often since 1945 that no one can be quite sure where he will stand
next; the band of left-wing malcontents who, in spite of their frequent and
vociferous interventions, never have the slightest influence on policy and
never add significantly to their numbers; the pamphleteers, who serve their
purpose in a left-wing party, but whose influence and power are negligible; and
a collection of displaced persons, some of whom would fit more happily into the
right wing of their party but who now and then lose their moorings and drift
into the most unlikely company.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;If
this group of Labour M.P.s tried to put forward a positive motion of their own
on the question of rearmament, <em>they would
find it extremely difficult&#8212;if not impossible&#8212;to agree on terms</em>.&#8221; (Our
emphasis.)
</p>
<h4>Industrial action</h4>
<p class="fst">
At the same
time in common with the right-wing Trade Union and Labour leaders, Bevan has
come out strongly in opposition to any extra-Parliamentary movement of protest
against the attacks of the Tory Government. As he said on February 25<sup>th</sup>
in the House of Commons: &#8220;I have received requests quite recently to address
many large meetings of members of Trade Unions who want to take industrial
action in order to influence the decision of this House,&#8221; and went on, &#8220;I
deplore that. I believe it would be a profound mistake for the Trade Union
masses of this country by direct political action to try to influence the
course of Parliamentary legislation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The
right-wing Trade Union and Labour Party leaders, and Bevan all use the fact
that the &#8220;Communist&#8221; Party for its own ends is attempting to whip up agitation
on this question and in that sense, they all endeavour to hold back the
development of the workers&#8217; initiative, in action, against the Tory
provocation.
</p>
<h4>Need for a Left Wing</h4>
<p class="fst">
Nevertheless,
the coming struggles against the Tories must find their reflection in the
Labour Party. The rank and file see in the policy of Bevan a striving for an
alternative to that of the dead hand of officialdom in the Labour Party and
Trade Unions. At this stage it cannot be expected that the left wing, moving
away from the bankrupt policy of the leadership should have a fully worked-out
programme, clear and consistent. Undoubtedly the majority of the rank and file
in the Trade Union branches, wards and divisional Labour Parties, support Bevan
as an invigorating contrast to what amounts to a bi-partisan policy on
rearmament.
</p>
<p>
The fear
and dismay with which the right-wing officials regard this development is
indicated by the vicious attack of Arthur Deakin against Bevan on purely
personal grounds. Instead of contrasting the two differing policies, whether
correct or incorrect, we have a meaningless diatribe on the ambitions and
egoism of Bevan, which have little to do with the issue. The Bevanites
effectively answered in <em>Tribune</em> by
challenging Deakin to counterpose the two programmes in its pages. The attempt
to silence Bevan and his friends by the subjective approach on the one hand and
to use the bludgeon of the threat of discipline in the other (which would force
Labour M.P.s to vote for Tory policy), are symptomatic of the fears of the
right wing.
</p>
<p>
The latter
fear the deep discontent still simmering within the ranks of the Labour Party
and that Bevan and his friends will act as a focal point around which the left
wing of the Labour Party may crystallise. Once the full flood of events reveals
the impasse into which the movement has been led by the acceptance of its
policies it must result in mass disillusionment. It is not so much, the
programme of Bevan of which they are afraid but of the way in which the masses
will rally at any rate in the beginning to organise opposition around its
banner.
</p>
<h4>The way out</h4>
<p class="fst">
It is true,
that no more than the policy of the right wig, can the policy offered by Bevan
(itself one of bits and pieces) be a solution to the economic and social
problems facing Britain. The programme put forward by <em>Tribune</em> reflects confusion and vagueness. Bevanism offers no real
answer to these problems. A cut of &#163;250.000,000 out of the colossal figure of
&#163;1,377,200,000 net for 1952-53 and they would accept apparently even the Tory
arms programme. This &#163;250,000,000 to be used in constructive capital investment
so that Britain will be in a stronger position to compete on the world market.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Mr. Crossman said if we could switch about &#163;250
million from armaments to exports and capital investment on exports, we might
get over the crisis by a narrow margin. (Our emphasis.) If we did that and
asked America to supply us with &#163;250,000,000 more arms it would equal one-tenth
of their export surplus. If the choice was to retard the programme or be
bankrupt, it was about time we began to retard the programme, however gravely
it might inconvenience the Chiefs of Staff.&#8221; (<em>Times</em>, March 6<sup>th</sup>.) 
</p>
<p class="fst">
At the same
time, American Imperialism must be cajoled into assisting their ally with more
money and aid. The burden of rearmament should be equitably shared.
</p>
<p>
On the
surface hardly a programme to shake the Labour Party from top to bottom and
promote the open defiance of approximately one-fifth of the Parliamentary
Labour Party.
</p>
<h4>Bevan stimulates
discussion</h4>
<p class="fst">
Thus the
importance of the Bevan movement lies in the fact that it must give an impulse
to critical thought and discussion. It gives an impetus to the hammering-out of
a policy and programme for the movement rather than being a fully worked-out
alternative itself. At this stage it marks a step in the right direction.
</p>
<p>
All
thinking comrades who have the interest of the Labour movement at heart must
rally to defend Bevan and the other comrades against the attack of the right
wing, who have absolutely nothing to offer except social chaos and a faintly
softened echo of Tory policy.
</p>
<p>
The Tories
say to the right wing, &#8220;You cannot have rearmament and maintain the standards
of living&#8221; and &#8220;How can you oppose our cuts, and demands for sacrifices on the
part of the masses when you support the premise on which these cuts were
based?&#8221; These arguments, given the policy of the Labour leadership, must have a
certain effect on the middle class and even backward sections of the workers.
To a certain extent it is true as the <em>Manchester
Guardian</em> points out (March 5<sup>th</sup>) the Tribunites are involved in
the same dilemma, &#8220;The Gallic spirits would have liked something much more
fierce calling for cuts in rearmament, but that would by implication have
condemned the good work done by the Labour Government in getting rearmament
started. It would have been no credit to Labour, past or present. The late
Government set the programme on its way and made the additions to it which a
threatening situation demanded, bringing it to the &#163;4,700 millions form. Mr.
Bevan&#8217;s belated objection to the additions was not supported by the Party when
in office, and a general shift of opinion now would say little for Labour&#8217;s
strength of mind. <em>Woolly wizardry is all
very well in the columns of Tribune, but a weak basis for a responsible party.
And what else but woolly can we call the demand &#8216;to build the forces needed to
prevent the success of any further Soviet promoted adventures&#8217; when it is
combined with refusal to pay for or provide those forces?</em>&#8221; (Our emphasis.)
In short they too cannot have their cake and eat it.
</p>
<p>
It is
because of this that Bevan and his followers attempt to justify their policies
by arguing whether or not the figures of Russian divisions, as put forward by
both the present and last Government, are correct. They attempt to decry the
Russian potential in order to argue, while accepting the same premises, that
the danger from Stalinist Russia is not so formidable<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup>. 
At the
same time Bevan has been pushed by the latest developments, to argue correctly
that Stalinism in China, despite its totalitarian garb, represents the social
revolution which has taken place there. He castigated those forces in America
who wish to wage war on the social revolution in Asia. However, the only reason
why British imperialism does not act in full accord with those forces in
America who wish to implement such a policy, is its own weakness and the
realisation of the futility of such action.
</p>
<p>
But Bevan
too expressed his support for the containment of &#8220;Communism&#8221; (Stalinism) by
suggesting that the only way to achieve this was not military methods but
improving the standards of the backward and downtrodden peoples of Asia and
Africa. This to be achieved by a programme of economic aid, the finance of
which was to be obtained by cutting the rearmament programme. His reasoning is
unassailable! There is only one small flaw with this logic, Capitalism is not a
mutual benefit society! The capitalists produce for profit and not to improve
the standards of living. Before a real socialist programme of mutual aid which
would benefit Asia, Africa, Britain and Europe could be planned and executed, a
fundamental change in Britain&#8217;s social structure would be necessary.
</p>
<h4>The need for a
Socialist policy</h4>
<p class="fst">
In this
lies the hub of the question. The problem is really one of the necessity for a
fundamental change in home and foreign policy which would largely eliminate the
need for rearmament. <em>Only a programme
which would advocate the overthrow of capitalism, by nationalising under
workers&#8217; control all big industry (with little or no compensation for the
ex-owners) could lay the basis economically, for a plan which would be based on
the needs of the masses at home and abroad. Only a bold socialist programme
could provide the necessary drive to achieve this, and that is what the active
workers in the movement are looking for.</em> They want a policy which will
protect them from the grim alternatives of war or slump.
</p>
<p>
Every
worker worth his salt will support this first important revolt in the Labour
Party as the beginning of a necessary regroupment within the Labour Party.
Bevan in spite of the weaknesses in his case reflects the desire for a real
socialist programme on which the Labour Movement can fight to defeat the
Tories. It can be a step on the road of the clarification of the left, which
will find that only a programme of a worker&#8217;s socialist democracy is the answer
to American Capitalism in the economic sphere and Stalinist totalitarianism in
the political sphere.
</p>
<p>
For
the moment the dispute has been patched up by the resolution of the executive
which mildly rebukes the fifty-seven and demands the reintroduction of standing
orders. But this will not be the end. The further worsening of the economic
situation in Britain cannot but push the workers to demand more radical
policies on the part of the Trade Unions and the Labour Party. The further
deepening of the differences which have now begun to manifest themselves is
inevitable.
</p>
<p>
Only a
radical reorganisation of programme and policy will be adequate to cope with
the needs of the time, and such a radical programme will be facilitated by the
emergence of a powerful left wing. The Bevan revolt is the first step in this
direction.
</p>
<h4>Notes in original:</h4>
<p class="fst">
<sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-1" name="foot-1">(1)</a></sup> The
addition of the industrial potential of Western Germany in Freeman&#8217;s article in
&#8220;Going Our Way&#8221; to that of Britain, America and the Commonwealth is false
because under present conditions, in the event of a war, it
would be a matter of weeks before it was added to Russia&#8217;s potential.
