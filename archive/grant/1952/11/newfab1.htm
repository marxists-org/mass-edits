<h4>A Political and Philosophical Basis for the Left Wing</h4>

<p class="fst">The publication of the <em>New Fabian Essays </em>with an introduction by
Attlee marks a stage in the development of the labour movement in Britain. In it
is supposed to be summed up the experience of the last 50 years both nationally
and internationally, by the intellectual elite of the Labour Party including
Crossman, Crosland, Strachey, Mikardo, Denis Healey, Austen Albu, Jenkins and
others.</p>

<p>The old programme of the Fabians, having been largely carried out by the
Labour government between 1945-50, is recognised as being inadequate or outmoded
to solve the problems of creating a socialist society. At the same time there is
ferment within the ranks of the labour movement; the rank and file are looking
for a theoretical and practical explanation of the inadequacies of the
government of 1945-50 in order to implement policies which will clear the way
for socialism.</p>

<p>The publication of Bevan's book<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup>, the new Socialist
Union publication, and the <em>New Fabian Essays </em>are all symptomatic of the
awakening and the searching for a fresh policy. The Bevan controversy which has
shaken the movement from top to bottom is the best indication of this search for
a policy and programme which will serve the needs of socialism.</p>

<p>To analyse adequately and criticise all the arguments in <em>New Fabian Essays
</em>would require another book as lengthy or lengthier than the <em>Essays </em>themselves,
especially as the <em>Essays </em>contradict each other in many fundamentals and
do not constitute a harmonious philosophical, theoretical or political whole.
Despite the varying views and some healthy criticisms of the bureaucratised
nationalised industries (from the point of view of pressing for greater
democracy and greater participation of the workers in the control of these
industries), there are some basic threads of thought underlying all the <em>Essays</em>:
the idea that the structure of British society has been fundamentally
changed by the nationalisation of some of the basic industries and the creation
of the 'Welfare State', the rejection of Marxism which is equated with the
doctrine of totalitarian Stalinism, and the theory that this is the epoch of the
so-called 'managerial revolution'.</p>

<p>One striking feature of the <em>Essays </em>is the rejection at least in words
of the narrow and provincial view of old Fabians who confined themselves to
Britain and British problems and ignored world developments. At a time when even
capitalist politicians have been forced by the realities of economic evolution
to recognise the interdependence of the world, and when events have brought home
crushingly the urgency of international problems even from the point of view of
day to day policies, it is no longer possible to maintain such a provincial
outlook. At the same time, on home problems too, Fabian pace, snail's pace, has
been discredited as a method of obtaining the socialist objective. Without a
drastic overhaul of social relations reaction is bound to set in.</p>


<h4>Leadership Holds Back</h4>

<p>Richard Crossman perhaps unwittingly gives the key to the solution of the
dilemma facing the workers in the labour movement when he says 'At that time
(first months of Labour rule) the British people were ready to accept the
peaceful socialist revolution; and if what it got was merely welfare capitalism,
the fault lay with the politicians and not with the public.' Thus a golden
opportunity of transforming Britain into a workers' democracy and shaking the
world by her example was lost by the cowardice and shortsightedness of the
leadership. A bold and radical nationalisation of all industry with, perhaps,
compensation on the basis of a means test, an appeal to the workers of Europe
and Asia to join and set up a United Socialist States of Europe and Asia would
have changed world history and begun the transition to socialism for the people
and states of the whole world.</p>

<p>The people of Britain, and of the world, will have to pay in agony and
suffering for the failure to accomplish the overthrow of capitalism which lay
within the grasp of the Labour government in Britain. The rearmament race, and
the undermining of the reforms of the Labour government, even in the latter
period of Labour's rule, indicate that 'welfare capitalism' cannot maintain
itself for any extended period of time. In the situation of British and world
capitalism reforms are inevitably undermined by the impasse of the system
itself. Only a fundamental change, economically and politically, can stabilise
reforms and steadily prepare the way for a new socialist society.</p>

<p>The new Fabians are haunted by the experience of Stalinism in Russia, China
and Eastern Europe. This leads them to stress the dangers of the 'concentration
of power in the hands of <em>either </em>industrial management or the state
bureaucracy'. Says Crossman:</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;This task was not even begun by the Labour government. On the contrary,
in the nationalised industries old managements were preserved almost untouched,
and appointments to the national, regional and consultative boards were made as
if with the express intention of reaffirming that no change was intended. The
government's attitude to central planning was simple. Up to 1947, no serious
attempt was made to construct even a central mechanism for assessing resources
and requirements of wealth and labour, and allocating them to the various
needsNor was an effort made to encourage popular participation in the new
Welfare Statethe impression was given that socialism was an affair for the
Cabinet, acting through the existing Civil Service.&quot;</p>

<p>Crossman and the other Fabians might have added that the power of the
capitalists remained largely as it was. Over the period of Labour's rule the
profits of the capitalists actually increased, while the state machine: army,
police, civil bureaucracy, in its topmost strata remained the preserve of
faithful members and supporters of the ruling class. In the structure of rule
the power of the ruling class thus remained virtually intact. It is this, at
least in part, which the new Fabians are compelled to recognise and to call for
the <em>active and direct Participation of the masses in industry </em>and, we
might add, in the direct administration of the state from top to bottom, if
enthusiasm and activity are to be engendered.</p>


<h4>Has Capitalism Been Transformed?</h4>

<p>Nevertheless, as a result of full employment in Britain consequent on the
post-war boom, the mirage appears of a change in capitalist economy which has
transformed it into a post-capitalist 'managerial', 'controlled' economy, <em>in</em>
<em>which the laws of capitalist economy no longer operate, thus eliminating
slumps and booms. </em>This receives its finished expression in the essay of
Anthony Crosland.</p>

<p>He starts with a complete distortion of the Marxist analysis mainly because,
to put it mildly, of his ignorance of the economic and philosophical doctrines
of Marx. It is a pity he did not take Engels' advice 'a man who undertakes to
discuss scientific questions should learn above all to read the works of the
author whom he wishes to study, just as they have been written, and especially
not to find anything in them which they do not contain'. For example, the
idea theat 'capitalism would collapse of its own accord'. An idea more foreign
to the method of Marxism would be more difficult to conceive. And a few
paragraphs after the assertion that the Marxist prognosis is false (how explain
the revolutions in China, Russia and Eastern Europe on this basis?) he asserts
'The resistance to change, moreover, has been weakened by the fact that the
capitalist bourgeoisie is no longer as self-confident as in its hey-day.' And
again 'Savage taxation of income and property and the nationalisation of private
industries have aroused scarcely more opposition than measures to limit child
labour a hundred years ago.'</p>

<p>It never occurs to him that it is the twilight of capitalism
nationally and internationally which has undermined the confidence of the
capitalists; the development of capitalism beyond the framework of private
ownership which forces the capitalist class to swallow limited measures of
statification to keep the economy going. It is the industries ruined <em>by
capitalism, </em>too expensive to regenerate by old methods, in which the
capitalists swallow nationalisation as a necessary evil. But, as soon as a
favourable opportunity occurs, <em>profitable </em>industries like steel and road
transport are handed back, at a handsome discount, to big business.</p>

<p>This it is which makes so dangerous the complacency of Crosland and others in
the Labour Party who think as he does that the capitalists will inevitably
swallow other reforms as tamely as in the last period of office of Labour.
Shortsightedness could not go further in analysing the reaction to reforms by
the capitalists. You can trim the claws of a tiger but its dangerous strength
remains, especially when its teeth are untouched. Woe betide the unwary who
place their bodies at the mercy of the wild animals of big finance.</p>

<p>After the first world war capitalism in Western Europe, especially in
Germany, accepted many reforms to ride the revolutionary tide and save the
system from complete overthrow. It did not prevent them later, in desperation,
from financing and supporting Hitler. In 1936 the French capitalists acquiesced
in many reforms for fear of the masses, following the stay-in strikes. This did
not prevent them from returning to the attack and whittling away the reforms as
soon as the mass upsurge was spent. After 1918 in Britain many reforms were
achieved which did not prevent Baldwin later from launching an all out attack
which precipitated the general strike of 1926.</p>

<p>Under Crosland's nose and as he wrote, the Conservative government of
Churchill is cautiously whittling away the gains made by the workers in 1945-9.
And this while 'full employment' remains!</p>

<p>In what would undoubtedly have been written in humorous vein if Crosland had
even a nodding acquaintance with Marxist doctrine, he says 'The propertied class
has lost its traditional capitalist function -the exploitation with its own
capital of the technique of production - and as the function disappears so the
power slips away.' Leaving aside the error in the last few words, Marx had
already observed the process and predicted the result a century or so ago. The
'modern' Crosland is a little behind! And as if the necessity of change from one
social system to another is not signalised by the loss of function in production
(as Marx explained a thousand times) of the old ruling class! Thus the loss of
function of the feudal lords who became parasites before the Cromwellian and
especially the French revolutions, as even Carlyle observed. And as if the
socialisation of labour under capitalism, the centralisation of capital, the
creation of joint stock companies - had not been analysed by both Marx and
Engels. Also the consequent transformation of the entrepreneurs from a necessary
function in production to complete parasites and drones has been shown as an
inevitable result of the process of capitalist production:</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;Stock companies in general, developed with the credit system, have a
tendency to separate this labour of management as a function more and more from
the ownership of capital, whether it be self-owned or borrowed. In the same way
the development of bourgeois society separates the functions of judges and
administrators from feudal property, whose prerogatives they were in feudal
times. Since the mere owner of capital, the money-capitalist, has to face the
investing capitalist, whilst the money capital itself assumes a social character
with the advance of credit, being concentrated in banks and loaned by them
instead of by its original owners, and since, on the other hand, the mere
manager, who has no title whatever to the capital, whether by borrowing or
otherwise, performs all real functions pertaining to the investment capitalist
as such, only the functionary remains and the capitalist disappears from the
process of production as a superfluous person.&quot; (<em>Capital</em>, volume 3, page
387) <sup><a href="../../../marx/works/1894-c3/ch23.htm">[source (translation differs)]</a></sup></p>



<p>Ironically enough it is precisely Crosland and his colleagues who believe
that capitalism collapses automatically by transforming itself into something
else once the function of the entrepreneurs has disappeared! Marx, on the
contrary, pointed out the necessity under these conditions for the proletariat,
organised in the labour movement, consciously to overthrow the dying system of
capitalism. The reaction to these conditions would produce the party and
leadership, despite many errors and lost opportunities, which would ultimately
destroy capitalism. The existence of such conditions, to a Marxist, would merely
prove the extreme decay of capitalism and the ripeness of the social system for
the socialist revolution.</p>


<h4>Crisis Ended?</h4>

<p>Crosland, however, excels himself in his analysis of the economic plight of
capitalism. Airily dismissing the Marxist thesis on the contradictions of
capitalism he observes that 'The 1931 depression, although unusually severe, was
not the first depression of such severity - the famous slump of 1873-7 was at
least as bad.' This is to compare the effects of a cold in youth to pneumonia in
old age. The slump of 1873-7 marked a great economic convulsion of capitalism.
It succeeded in escaping its effects by the intensive expansion of the
Californian gold fields, the opening-up of Africa and Asia, the development of
imperialism. These were some of the reasons why, after the slump of 1873 there
was a relative ascent of capitalism. Says Schumpeter<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup>:</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;The broad fact of great steadiness in long term increaseremains,
both in the sense of rough constancy of the gradient of the trend and in the
sense of what, merely by way of formulating a visual impression, we may term the
general dominance of trend over fluctuations<em>In no country does 1873
look very catastrophic. </em>In America 1844 produced almost no fall at all. The
crises of the early nineties shows, for Germany, only a considerable dent. In
the long English series it happens only twice that absolute fall outlasts two
years. In the case of Germany, this occurred only in 1868, 1869 and 1870; in
America also but once.&quot; (<em>Business Cycles</em>, McGraw-Hill Volume 2, page
494, our emphasis)</p>

<p>But every authoritative capitalist economist and observer was profoundly
dismayed at the spectacle of the slump of 1931-3. The period of rising
capitalism came to an end in 1914. After 1873-7 there were depressions but not
such as to shake the economy from top to bottom. After the 1929-33 collapse had
been painfully overcome only the rearmament boom and the war prevented an even
more shattering recurrence of the slump. It was this in economic terms
which precipitated the second world war of 1939-45. This is hardly a symptom of
the health of the economic system. Periodic wars of destruction which threaten
to annihilate the cities man has built and technical conquests achieved, are
hardly an inspiring alternative for capitalism to offer to periodic crises of
over-production. But here Crosland, Strachey and others deny or half deny that
over-production or slump will occur. They think the full employment which
obtained in Britain under the Labour government (and to a slightly less extent
obtains also under Churchill's government) was a consequence of the policies of
the Labour government.</p>

<p>This was so only to a secondary extent. Full employment obtains in America,
the last stronghold of capitalism, also since 1945. In both cases this is due to
the boom which usually follows every war. War has the same effect as a slump,
where the ruin, destruction and wearing out of capital and consumer goods paves
the way for recovery, but in an enormously intensified form. The capitalist
crisis is overcome in war by the destruction of consumer and capital goods, by
the production of fictitious capital in the shape of arms and arms production,
which has, after the war, to be made good by economy. But despite measures of
'regulation' and 'control', despite the enormously increased role of state and
of militarism (incidentally forecast by Marx and Engels) <em>the problems of
capitalism are not overcome, </em>neither is the elimination of capitalism
achieved thereby. Where, as in Britain, 80 per cent of the economy is privately
owned, the laws of capitalism basically continue as before. The capitalists <em>continue
to operate for profit </em>not for the sake of keeping the economy on a high
level. Any spending by the state by so-called 'Keynesian techniques' can only
aggravate economic crisis <em>once the crisis of over-production begins.</em></p>

<p>A simple point which even the orthodox capitalist economists can understand
is that 'money' or 'credit' is not created in the void. It has to be obtained by
taxes ie <em>by cutting into the profits of the capitalists, </em>or the
subsistence standards of the workers, or by 'deficit financing, which in a
roundabout way comes to the same thing. This is because by artificially
increasing the note issues, it decreases the purchasing power of money by
inflation and thus in the long run has the same effect as the above. Either way
a fall in the rate of profit is inevitable. Purchasing power is cut and
endeavours of this sort can only aggravate the outbreak of mass unemployment and
crisis.</p>


<h4>Effect of Rearmament</h4>

<p>In a certain sense rearmament on a world scale is having this effect in the
capitalist countries. The expenditure on arms creates an enormous amount of
fictitious capital which gets its share of the total wealth, of the surplus
created by the working class. It has as a consequence a rise in prices, and
usually a decrease in the standard of living of the workers. While injecting a
further element of disease in the already decaying organism of capitalism, it
cannot prevent but only <em>delay </em>the outbreak of crisis.</p>

<p>It is true that many in the Labour Party, particularly some of the Bevanites,
think that rearmament can be replaced and slump avoided by an extended 'point 4'
programme. But even a 'plan' (if it were to be agreed upon by the European
powers and the USA) greater in scope than point 4 would, despite the ballyhoo,
be microscopic in relation to the needs of Asia and Africa. It would be even
less able to absorb the production and potential over-production in the
capitalist world and would not succeed in preventing crisis.</p>

<p>In particular Crosland and others of like mind are living in a fool's
paradise when the problems of the world market are taken into account. A <em>minor
economic recession </em>or fall in production of a few per cent, which would
hardly provoke a ripple in America, will mean major economic convulsions in
Britain and Western Europe. It can be imagined then what would be the effect of
a big fall in production. This is recognised fearfully even by such journals as
the<em> Observer </em>and<em> The Economist.</em></p>

<p>Nationally and internationally the market economy still dominates in Britain.
In his muddled way even Crosland has glimmerings of the problem. He says 'Under
the post-war Labour administration the tempo of change was enormously
accelerated and by 1951 <em>Britain had in all essentials ceased to be a
capitalist country</em>' (my emphasis). And on the very next page he
unconsciously contradicts himself. 'It ('Welfare State', 'Mixed Economy') is
capitalist to the extent that private ownership of industry predominates, that
most production is for the market, and that many of the old class divisions
persist.' <em>To what extent? </em>Where 80 per cent of the economy is privately
owned, capitalism, its economy and its laws are predominant. The public sectors,
like the post office in the past, will <em>operate for the benefit of the private
sector. </em>No amount of financial juggling can overcome that decisive fact.
Until the dominating heights and the dominating proportion of industry is
nationalised the laws of capitalist economy will dictate to the government,
whether Labour or Conservative.</p>

<p>It is from this fundamental error that flow the mistakes and dreams of
Crosland and other Fabians. No more Jarrows and Ebbw Vales. 'Both the area, and
the bitterness, of social conflict are much reducedno uniquely delineated
ruling class, nor clearly defined class struggle.'</p>


<h4>Class Antagonisms Intensified</h4>

<p>In reality, however, the rumblings of the coming storm are faintly
foreshadowed in the strike of steel workers and miners in America and the wage
demands of the engineers, miners and other workers in Britain, in the face of
the steadily increasing cost of living. The capitalists are cautiously preparing
for the struggle. If in the post-war period in Britain and America (not on the
Continent be it noted) a relative period of quiet has ensued, that has
been because of international relations, the class relations within the
countries themselves, the mighty strength of organised labour, the fear of the
ruling class, but above all <em>because the ruling class could afford crumbs of
concessions from the feast of profits in the post-war boom.</em></p>

<p>But this period is now drawing to a close. Far from the fond dream of class
reconciliation, a period of bitter, more implacable class conflict looms ahead
in all its stark horror. The 'new' Fabians may think their themes are really
'modern', 'realistic' and 'new'. In fact in one form or another every boom has
seen the dissemination of these panaceas and utopias, of a change in capitalism,
of a new stage, of sedate, kind and tolerant amelioration of class antagonisms,
of a rosy period of gradual change for the better, of great reforms which all
ended in disaster. On the basis of the new Fabians' themes the labour movement
could only find catastrophe.</p>
