The
one day strike of the railwaymen closed the railways and the London
tubes completely. This mass gesture of solidarity and determination
was a warning to the government and the employing class that the
railwaymen will not allow themselves to be treated with the cold
calculated cruelty with which the ruling class regards the &#8220;hands&#8221;
on whose labour their profits depend.
</p>
<p>
Dr.
Beeching, the representative of big business who has been put in
charge of the railways to serve the interests of the capitalists, at
first attempted to maintain the stand of implacability. The <em>Daily
Herald</em>
of 16<sup>th</sup>
October said that the Railway Commission&#8217;s policy was &#8220;No retreat
on sackings&#8221; and &#8220;In broad outline his plans for closing down 12
railway workshops must go ahead&#8221;. These plans involve the sacking
of 159,000 railwaymen over the next 5 to 10 years. As a foretaste of
the future, 12 railway workshops are to be closed down next year with
the sacking of 18,000 to 20,000 men.
</p>
<p>
It
is the announcement of this plan that provoked the justified anger
and indignation of the railwaymen. Systematically, rich contracts
that could be fulfilled in the railway workshops are being given to
private firms. Despite the fact that the equipment is there the
railway workshops are not allowed to make any goods for sale outside
the railways as this would compete with private enterprise! The
commission then announces that the workshops do not pay and prepares
to close them down as if they were to be discarded like empty
cigarette packets.
</p>
<h4>Fobbed off with a pittance</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
railwaymen in the workshops understand that they are regarded as the
least important part of the machinery in the workshops. After a
lifetime of service they are to be fobbed off with a pittance in
compensation for their lost jobs. Others will be unceremoniously
bundled out and told to &#8220;find&#8221; other jobs elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
The
Executive
of the NUR has stood firm. Greene, the general secretary, faced with
the bitter mood of the men, warned Dr. Beeching &#8220;The whole workshop
plan must be withdrawn or there will be a strike&#8221;. He also declared
&#8220;They wanted him (Dr. Beeching) to scrap the present proposals for
closures of railway workshops and start again in consultations with
the unions&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
This
is a bit weaker than the previous declaration. The whole of the press
recognised the strength of the railwaymen&#8217;s determination and the
sympathy of the organised working class for the railwaymen&#8217;s
wishes, and tried to enmesh and ensnare the unions involved, into
&#8220;consultations&#8221;, not on policy but to make the sackings as
painless as possible. It is like suggesting to a man that he
&#8220;co-operate&#8221; in cutting off fingers and toes rather than lose a
whole hand or foot.
</p>
<h4>Worn
out parts!</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
attitude of the workers was expressed by Harold Poole,
vice-president of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering
Unions, who have 50,000 key craftsmen as members in the railway
workshops. &#8220;We are not going to see our men thrown out as though
they were worn out parts in a workshop&#8221;. A new strike involving not
only the NUR members on the railways, but the docks, provincial buses
and support from other transport unions has been suggested. Not a
strike for 24 hours but a week or more. This would hit Britain&#8217;s
economy hard and cost far more than would be &#8220;saved&#8221; by railway
sackings. Yet in pursuit of their class interests the ruling class is
prepared to risk this.
</p>
<p>
For
the moment there are &#8220;consultations&#8221; taking place between the
railway unions and the railway commission. Dr. Beeching admitted the
mistake of non-consultation with union representatives. Consultation
for what? Consultation for the sacking of thousands of rail workers!
The rank-and-file must continue to exert pressure in their branches
and demonstrations demanding no retreat from a policy of no sackings.
</p>
<h4>Cut compensation</h4>
<p class="fst">
Railway
workers should demand no sackings or full pay till appropriate
alternative work is found. The compensation offered is an insult. If
money is to be saved cut the compensation to the parasites who got
paid out on watered stock for a bankrupt industry. The interest
burden amounts to terms of millions of pounds a year. Let the
compensation be on the basis of need only! The railwaymen have
contributed to society, the owners have been a burden to society.
</p>
<h4>Co-ordinated plan</h4>
<p class="fst">
At
the same time transport needs a co-ordinated plan. A plan which will
involve all transport and air. The government in the interest of
private profit has given many rich routes to private airlines thus
resulting in losses to the nationalized airlines. Road transport was
handed over as a rich plum to &#8220;private enterprise&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
Above
all the lesson should have been driven home that nationalization is
not enough. The workers in the industry must participate from top to
bottom in control and deciding policy for the industry. Instead of
the Dr. Beechings and other representatives of big business the trade
union movement through the TUC must be brought into the management of
nationalized industries.
</p>
<p>
Railwaymen
do not be fobbed off by a slower process of attrition in the war on
the railwaymen. Stand firm on the demand for no sackings! Workers in
the trade unions and Labour parties send resolutions of sympathy and
support to the railwaymen!
