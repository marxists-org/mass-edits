<p class="fst">
The
heroic miners of Asturias have been on strike since Easter Monday. Close on
60,000 to 100,000 miners of North Spain have been out during this time.
Following the miners&rsquo; strike have come sympathy strikes in different parts of
Spain: 3,000 copper miners in Rio Tinto, and in the industrial and mining zone
of the Basque province at Bilbao and Beasin 60,000 miners, engineers and
shipyard workers are out on strike. The strike has spread to factories in
Valencia and Galicia. In Barcelona engineering plants of Pirelli, Siemens and
ENASA lorry manufacturers have joined the strike.
</p>
<p>
In Bilbao
steel and chemical workers have joined the miners and engineers in striking and
demanding higher pay. Workers in Madrid are now joining in the struggle. At
Vallecas, a Madrid suburb, the railway repair shop workers have begun a
sit-down strike. At Villarverde the workers are preparing to strike in new
factories established by the Franco regime. In some small plants the employers
have avoided strike action by conceding the claims of the workers.
</p>
<p>
Thus the
strike is beginning to assume national scope. This in the teeth of the laws of
the fascist dictatorship under which strikes are illegal. Franco has declared a
&ldquo;state of emergency&rdquo; in the Northern Provinces. This is equivalent to a
declaration of martial law.
</p>
<p>
The
conditions and standards of living of the Spanish workers are among the worst
in Europe. For an 11 and a half hour working day, including piece work and
overtime for 6 days a week the coal face workers earn from &pound;6 to &pound;7 per week.
The miners basic rate is 4/10d [4 shillings and ten pence, or 24p in decimal
currency] per day. This in a country where prices of basic necessities are the
same as in Britain! During the last 3 years wages have remained the same while
the cost of living has more than doubled. Such staple items as olive oil, used
by the Spanish for cooking, fish and meat, have increased more than twice in
price.
</p>
<h4>300,000 on strike</h4>
<p class="fst">
Three
hundred of the miners&rsquo; leaders have been arrested. And one of the demands of
the miners is the release of all those imprisoned and no victimisation before
they return to work. Similar demands are being made by the workers in industry
who are on strike. More than 300,000 of the Spanish workers have been on strike
at one time or another since the end of April. Thus the ferment is spreading
all over Spain. It has been encouraged by the reports from the 120,000 Spanish
workers who have emigrated to France, West Germany, Switzerland and Belgium who
have contrasted conditions there with the bad pay and miserable conditions in
Spain.
</p>
<p>
This is the
beginning of the end for the fascist regime in Spain. The middle class and the
intellectuals have demonstrated their sympathy with the heroic struggle of the
workers. Students at Barcelona and Madrid universities have demonstrated in the
streets in favour of the striking workers. Fifty have been arrested. In a
demonstration of &ldquo;silent sympathy&rdquo; in Madrid women intellectuals, ex-university
students, working women and wives of political prisoners participated in a
&ldquo;silent march&rdquo;. Seventy have been arrested and heavily fined. As a significant
indication of the changing mood, the Catholic authorities have changed their
position and even <i>Ecclesia</i>, the organ
of Catholic Action, has come out in defence of the right to strike.
</p>
<p>
One of the
leaders of the students, who staged sympathy strikes with the workers at
Barcelona and Madrid universities, declared: &ldquo;We have shown the workers that
other sections of society are with them.&rdquo;
</p>
<h4>Franco frightened</h4>
<p class="fst">
&ldquo;The
strikes have frightened Franco and they are just the beginning.&rdquo; Additional
point is given to this statement when it is known that the same student leader
had already served six months for distributing Socialist Party propaganda.
</p>
<p>
The &ldquo;Union
of Democratic Forces&rdquo; which comprises the Socialists, the UGT, the former
Socialist trade union federation of Spain, the Republican Action Party, the
Democratic Christian left and the Basque nationalists, have issued a manifesto
calling for &ldquo;peaceful action&rdquo; to end the Franco dictatorship. They called for
the Spanish people to &ldquo;carry out collective acts of civil resistance&rdquo; and
appealed to the Spanish capitalists, the Church and the armed forces to &ldquo;live
up to their responsibilities&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
The Spanish
Communist Party has called for anti-Franco demonstrations leading to a general
strike and for a &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; alternative to the Franco regime. Thus the very
forces which were responsible for the setting up of the fascist dictatorship in
Spain are being called upon to take action against the dictatorship! The
capitalists, the Roman Catholic hierarchy, the landlords and the officer caste
were the instigators of the fascist insurrection in Spain.
</p>
<h4>Beginning of the end</h4>
<p class="fst">
However,
these strikes mark the beginning of the end for the Franco regime. In the same
way the mass strikes of the workers of Milan, Turin and other industrial cities
in Italy, a year before Mussolini&rsquo;s fall marked the beginning of the end of the
fascist regime in Italy. It was then that the ruling class began to search for
some other means to prevent an uprising of the workers. Cracks always appear
within the ranks of the ruling class when they feel the threat of revolution
from below. Thus the attitude of the Spanish Catholic hierarchy, and of the capitalists
searching for some way out will increase the ferment among the workers. For the
time being the peasants are passive. But their conditions are even worse than
that of the working class and they will undoubtedly respond to any movement in
the towns.
</p>
<h4>Illegal leaflets</h4>
<p class="fst">
Meanwhile,
even according to the reports in the capitalist press, illegal leaflets are
circulating in all the main towns of Spain, calling for action to end the
dictatorship. For many years it has been impossible for the Franco regime to apply
its terror laws against all those who speak openly against the regime in
conversations in the streets. 95 percent of the population is against Franco
and therefore it would have been hopeless to arrest everyone who spoke out
against the corrupt regime and the terrible conditions of the people. But
action was systematically taken against all those who attempted to organise
resistance. There are still thousands of political prisoners in Spain, nearly a
quarter century after Franco&rsquo;s victory. But what kept the regime in power
despite the hatred of the people was the passivity and inertia of the masses,
betrayed by their organisations in the civil war which led to Franco&rsquo;s victory.
</p>
<h4>New generation</h4>
<p class="fst">
Now a new
generation has grown up. Passivity is at an end. The masses are beginning to
move. This strike action will be followed by even more bold activity on the
part of the workers, with the sympathy of the middle class and peasants.
</p>
<h4>Spanish socialist
republic</h4>
<p class="fst">
A new
period is opening up for the Spanish people. The fall of Franco can be the
starting point for the struggle for a Spanish socialist republic. The demand
for democratic rights and liberties, for freedom of speech, the right to
organise and strike should go hand in hand with an irreconcilable struggle against
those responsible for the fascist dictatorship. The Spanish people can only
solve their problems by ending landlordism and capitalism which were
responsible for the crime of fascism. The Socialist Party and the Communist
Party are repeating the mistakes which led to defeat in the civil war and which
destroyed the Spanish revolution. The workers must stand for an independent
class policy, drawing behind them the middle class and the peasants by catering
for their needs and interests.
</p>
<p>
The Danish
Metal Workers&rsquo; Union has donated &pound;1,250 to help the Spanish strikers. The
Labour Party&rsquo;s Spanish Democrats Defence Committee has sent &pound;250 to the Spanish
Socialist Party. More and bigger gestures of solidarity to the fighting Spanish
workers are needed. But direct sympathetic aid is even more important than
money. The trade union movement in Britain and internationally must establish
an embargo on goods coming to and from Spain at all ports and transit centres.
A campaign among the dockers, transport workers and seamen on these lines would
be bound to gain a sympathetic response if the labour movement were to give the
lead. The Finnish Seamen&rsquo;s Union decided on May 23<sup>rd</sup> to refuse tug
or other port assistance to Spanish ships in solidarity with the striking
Spanish workers. Action to help the Spanish workers in their mighty fight to
overthrow the Franco regime! Black all Spanish goods and services. Follow the
lead of the Finnish seamen.
