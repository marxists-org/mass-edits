<hr>
<p class="fst">&#8220;Peace&#8221;
in Algeria, through a cease-fire between the forces of French
Imperialism and those of the representatives of the Algerian people,
the F.L.N. seems likely in the immediate period ahead. According to
the terms leaked in the press, it seems as if French Imperialism has
succeeded in safeguarding some of its basic interests, the
exploitation of the mineral and oil resources of the Sahara jointly
by the French and Algerians, the retaining of military bases in
Algeria including the Mers El Kebir Naval base, and the retaining of
French citizenship for either three or five years, before making a
choice on the part of the European settlers.
</p>
<p>
This
compromise, however, still represents a defeat for French Imperialism
which has given up as hopeless the attempt to continue the national
subjugation of the Algerian people. Far from constituting a source of
revenue to the French capitalists it constituted a drain on the
resources of France. Hundreds of thousands of Algerian dead, torture
and the forcible resettling of 2 million of the Algerian people have
not broken their spirit or their desire for freedom.
</p>
<p>
At
the same time the French people have become more and more weary at
the never-ending war, with its victims among the sons of the French
people. They have become alarmed at the attempt to brutalise the
young French conscripts in the Army in Algeria. It imposes useless
sacrifices on the part of the French people.
</p>
<p>
It
is this factor, as much as anything else, which has led the de Gaulle
Government, a Bonapartist dictatorship, which is compelled to lean
for support on sections of the French people, to endeavour to end the
war. The repression and murder by the picked squads of the Gaullist
police of unarmed workers, men, women and children in a
demonstration, has been the spark to reawaken the radical traditions
of the French people. The imposing funeral demonstration of 1 million
people, the general strike for four hours in Paris, and other cities
in France, were an expression of the rising mass feeling.
</p>
<h4>Radical mood</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
mood of 1944-1947, of the great days of the stay-in strikes of 1936,
is being rekindled among the French masses. The defeat of 1958, when
de Gaulle was brought to power by the military coup in Algiers, is
beginning to be overcome by the French working class. It is alarm at
this awakening among the French people which has caused the de Gaulle
Government to hasten to try and make peace, on terms which do not
sacrifice the interests of Big Business.
</p>
<p>
De
Gaulle hopes to use the usual Bonapartist trick of the referendum&#8212;For
or against Peace&#8212;to gain an overwhelming Yes vote at the polls. He
hopes that the impetus given by such a referendum vote in its turn
would lead to a new electoral victory for the Gaullists at the
general election, which would be simultaneous with or shortly follow
such a referendum. He would be presented to the people as the man who
brought &#8220;Peace&#8221; and safeguarded the Republic and democratic
rights.
</p>
<p>
However,
the O.A.S. hired assassins and picked thugs continue with their work
of provocation both in Algeria and in France. Daily raids are
reported on munition stores; plastic bombs in Algerian and also in
Paris and French provincial towns, are planted with monotonous
regularity. One of the most recent was the planting of two bombs in
the presses of the Communist Party main journal <em>l&#8217;Humanite</em>,
and at the doors of the capitalist paper <em>Figaro</em>.
</p>
<h4>Fascists
penetrate &#8220;State&#8221;</h4>
<p class="fst">
The police
seem impotent when it comes to taking decisive action against the
fascist conspirators. These have a network of informants and
supporters in the top ranks of the Armed Forces, the police and the
civil service, not only in Algeria but in France itself. The de
Gaullist Government cannot take real measures against these people
without endangering the state machine of French capitalism. This is
what explains the tender treatment of this scum, guilty according to
the laws of France of high treason.
</p>
<p>
De Gaulle has
recently called to see him the leading military commanders in France,
including the notorious General Massu, who expressed himself so
forcibly and crudely at the time of the Algiers coup which brought de
Gaulle to power, in favour of mercilessly strangling French
democracy.
</p>
<h4>No
reliance [on the]
army</h4>
<p class="fst">
If the Army,
Admirals and Air Force generals do not rally to the call of the
O.A.S., it will not be for love of &#8220;democracy&#8221; and &#8220;honour&#8221;.
At the last attempted coup of Salan and Challe most of them prudently
waited to see the way the wind was blowing before declaring
themselves. It was the reaction of the French conscripts in the army,
navy and air force which made them declare themselves against the
mutineers. It was the reaction of the French people and the French
workers in uniform which paralysed the reactionary mutineers and the
paratroops.
</p>
<p>
Many
times in the history of France and with the great revolutionary
traditions of the French people, the use of troops or police to
massacre unarmed demonstrators has been the starting point of
revolution. So the impressive demonstration of a million people at
the funeral of the latest victims of police brutality ties up with
the past. Lenin had observed many times that such incidents and
crises could be the starting point for the Socialist revolution.
</p>
<p>
Not
only the industrial workers, but the white collar workers struck, and
the &#8220;little people&#8221; of Paris, small shopkeepers and other middle
class layers showed their sympathy with the workers of Paris.
</p>
<h4>No &#8220;Peace
and Order&#8221;</h4>
<p class="fst">
Sections
of the middle class, the white collar workers, and even layers of
politically backward industrial workers had been attracted to the
banner of de Gaulle as the man who would bring &#8220;peace and order and
prosperity&#8221; to France. Without an alternative programme of decisive
social change on the part of the organisations of the working class,
it is this which explains the victory of de Gaulle.
</p>
<p>
However,
the legend of Gaullist infallibility has worn thin. It is Big
Business which has been the principal beneficiary of the Gaullist
regime. The promised blessings have not materialised. Instead we have
the disturbances of the O.A.S&#8230;That is why the Gaullist regime
requires peace in Algeria for the purpose of trying to retain its
waning support even among the middle class.
</p>
<h4>Independent
workers&#8217; policy</h4>
<p class="fst">
In
this situation, with the rising radicalism and awakening of the
French people, the role of the leadership of the workers&#8217; parties,
and the policies they pursue is of great significance. An independent
class policy explaining the capitalist roots of the French state and
of the de Gaulle Government could win wide support among the French
people. Such a programme would include a whole series of demands in
the interests of the French workers and middle class and peasants, it
would link them with the perspective of a Socialist France.
</p>
<p>
It
would explain the need for the French workers to rely only on their
own organisations, committees of action in every factory and housing
area to ensure their defence against fascist provocation. It would
demand the setting up of committees of defence of the soldiers,
sailors and airmen, linked with the committees of students, peasants
as well as the factory committees. Such a network of committees would
constitute an impregnable defence against any fascist provocation, as
well as against such Army Commanders as General Massu.
</p>
<p>
Events
will teach the French workers. In this rising tide of radicalisation
the so-called leadership of the Communist Party has come forward with
a new version of class collaboration, coalition with the so-called
&#8220;Liberal&#8221; sections of the capitalist class, in the
&#8220;strike-breaking conspiracy&#8221; of the People Front. At the moment
of danger French capitalism will try and save itself by such a
coalition agreement as they did in 1936 and 1944. But the authority
of the leadership of the Communist Party is not so great as formerly.
This new treachery can in its turn lead to a split in the Communist
Party and the foundation of a mass Marxist Party pledged to the class
struggle. This would change the situation not only in France but
perhaps throughout Europe.
