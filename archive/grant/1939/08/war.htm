The capitalist drive towards war is assuming irresistibledimensions. Elaborate preparations, hidden and open, are being made for a newshowdown in August or September which may lead to war. Diplomatic militarypreparations are going on in every country in Europe.</p><p>The Britishfleet will be at full war strength in these months. A million men will be underarms in England,the biggest peace time number on record. France is calling up extrareservists and keeping the Maginot line fully manned. The British army is beingkept ready for immediate action. British troops have marched side by side withthe French in parades in Paris, and Britishbombers have flown over Francein demonstration flights.</p><p>In themeantime in Danzig, the key point in the crisis, contrary to threats and indefiance of Polandthe Nazis have feverishly fortified, armed and sent thousands of troops inpreparation of a coup. In an article in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> it is statedthat, &#8220;Germany&#8217;smilitary concentrations in the east and west are tremendous and almostcomplete.&#8221; The French Premier has declared that this is &#8220;Europe&#8217;sgravest situation for 20 years.&#8221;</p><p>The samearticle emphasises the international crisis. &#8220;Nobody believes,&#8221; says the <em>FrankfurterZeitung</em>, &#8220;that a change of direction in British policy will satisfy Germany&#8217;s vitalclaims&#8230; The trouble must therefore go on.&#8221;</p><p>In bellicosespeeches Poland&#8217;s rulershave announced that any attempt to annex Danzig to the Reich will mean war, andBritain and France have guaranteed support to Poland. &#8220;Inevent of further aggression we are resolved to use at once the whole of [our]strength in fulfilment of our pledges to resist it,&#8221; declared Lord Halifax forthe Government on June 30<sup>th</sup>.</p><p>Hore Belishahas indicated the seriousness of the position of French and British imperialismin a speech made in France.&#8220;Their peoples&#8221;&#8212;read British and French capitalists&#8212;&#8220;know that the long periodduring which they have been privileged to enjoy great wealth and great sway oneasy terms has been closing.&#8221;</p><p>In order tokeep their hands free of European complications, the British capitalists havebeen compelled to beat a temporary retreat in the Far East.Japan, taking advantage ofthe troubled situation, has forced British imperialism to grant them indirectsupport for their war in China.This horse deal in itself is a significant proof of how little the Britishimperialists are genuinely concerned for peace or in fighting &#8220;aggression.&#8221;Their main concern, as of all imperialists, is with protecting and adding totheir pitiless exploitation of the colonial and other peoples in the world.</p><p>The armamentsexpenditure still goes on, mounting to staggering proportions; &#163;730 million isbeing spent on arms in Britainthis year alone. The British and other Governments are preparing colossalburdens for the masses of the people in order to further their warpreparations.</p><p>Thenegotiations in Moscow for a military pact arestill dragging on, with Britainand the Soviet Union manoeuvring foradvantages and haggling over the details of military commitments. Here again itcan clearly be seen that the aim of the British imperialists is the protectionof their interests and nothing else.</p><p>Theideological preparations for the slaughter continue apace. Goebbels&#8217; propagandaministry continues to broadcast attacks on the inhuman treatment of thecolonial peoples by the &#8220;plutodemocracies&#8221;, which for their part monotonouslyretort with denunciations of the atrocities committed in the totalitarianstates.</p><p>MarshalSmigly-Rydz announces that the Polish people will fight to the last man for Danzig. &#8220;Polanddoes not want war but for us there are things worse than war and one of theseis the loss of our liberties.&#8221; In the house of the hanged one should not speakof the gallows. The Polish capitalists who have murdered, terrorised andoppressed Ukrainians, Galicians, Germans, Jews and other minorities, inaddition to the suppression of the workers and peasants, have the astoundingimpudence solemnly to talk of the &#8220;defence of liberty&#8221;.</p><p>The Britishpress has quoted these words approvingly, including the workers&#8217; press. ArthurGreenwood for the Labour Party has said that much as he loves peace he lovesliberty more and demands that Nazi Germany be stopped. The Labour Party hasissued a manifesto to the German people to take action against their rulers inthe interests of peace. The B.B.C. have had the major part broadcast to Germany. Thishas resulted in a fury of indignation among the Nazis in Germany. The <em>DailyHerald</em> of July 5<sup>th</sup> comments &#8220;They&#8221;&#8212;German newspapers&#8212;&#8220;do notlike it because the Labour appeal treats the German people as human beings, ascomrades, as partners in a common heritage. But the German government treatsthem as pawns, as counters, as gun-fodder.&#8221;</p><p>The laying ofthe burden for conducting the struggle against war on the shoulders of theGerman workers has aroused the righteous indignation of the Communist Party ofGreat Britain. Referring to the Labour appeal they point out that our task isto struggle at home, and then go on to demand a redoubled effort for theoverthrow of Chamberlain as the ally of Hitler, Hitler&#8217;s Fifth Column, etc.</p><p>If anythingthe hypocrisy of the Communist Party is even more blatant than that of theLabour Party. Both deceive the workers of Germanyand of Britainas to the real causes of the conflict which is impending. True enough, Hitleruses the German people as pawns, counters and gun-fodder. But in the coldblooded calculations of British, French and Polish imperialism, the workers inthese countries too are so much cannon fodder to be used to defend theircapitalist interest&#8212;nothing more.</p><p>The new foundinterest of Britain in&#8220;liberty loving&#8221; Poland andthe integrity of Eastern Europe is by no meansmotivated by an altruistic love of humanity. It is fear of the successfulrivalry of German imperialism.</p><p>The <em>DailyHerald</em> of July 1<sup>st</sup> admits the real cause of the conflict to benot different ideologies but the clash of interests of rival imperialisms. Theold imperialism must be ended, they appeal, if lasting peace is to bepreserved. To urge the imperialists to cease to be imperialists is like askingcarnivorous beasts of prey to cease eating meat and live on porridge. So longas imperialism and capitalism exist they must perforce go to war because of theconflict of economic interests.</p><p>The Britishcapitalists are no better and a great deal more hypocritical than their Germanrivals. Our job lies at home. If there is one thing which is preventing thecapitalists from going to war up to now, it has been fear of the wrath of theworking class.</p><p>Desperatelythe Brawn capitalists are attempting to find some way out of the impasse inwhich they have landed. The offer of a loan of &#163;1 million to Germany by R.S. Hudson, Minister for Overseas Trade was an impulsive attempt to find somecompromise. All the capitalists of the world are afraid of the war which isdeveloping, not because of any concern for human life but for fear of theinevitable revolutions which will arise from it. But even so they find asolution impossible. They may manage to delay the outbreak of war for a shortperiod but that is all.</p><p>To theworkers, and especially the youth who are now being trained in the use of armsin the militia and the army, we say: your enemy is not the youth in otherlands; it is the capitalist class at home. There is only one way to prevent warand if it breaks out to end it, namely, by the overthrow of capitalism, thereal root from which war springs.</p><p class="skip">&nbsp;</p><hr class="end" /><p class="footer"><a href="../../index.htm">Ted GrantArchive</a></p></body></html>
