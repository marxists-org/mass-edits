The quick successes anticipated by the Japanesehave failed to materialise. The costs of the war have meant a steady drain onthe financial and economic resources of Japan. The Japanese military cliquecan feel the rumble of the coming revolt which it has suppressed temporarily bydiverting the anger aroused in the masses by the social crisis in Japan into thechannels of &#8220;patriotism&#8221; and &#8220;nationalism.&#8221; But the contrast between the miseryand privation by the workers and peasants and the enormous super profits beingmade by the landlords and capitalists is driving the masses on to the road ofrevolution as the only way out.</p><p>These conditions havedriven the military clique in control in Japan completely off their balance.In sheer panic they have been compelled to try and make some desperate coupwhich will save the situation. Now that the war crisis in Europe is about toreach its peak (Churchill has warned of the coming period of crisis during thenext three months which can easily lead to war in Europe), the Japaneseimperialists have calculated that now is the time to strike a blow againsttheir imperialist rivals in the Far East.</p><p><em>That is the meaning of thecrisis over Tientsin</em> and now the Treaty Pacts of Swatow and Foochowhave been drawn into the struggle. The newspapers have been featuring withblazing headlines the &#8220;unprecedented treatment of British subjects. Thedeliberate insults, searching and stripping naked at the barrier, manhandling,the blockade of the British concession itself, indicate the lengths to whichthe Japanese are prepared to go.&#8221;</p><p>What the Japanese areaiming at is indicated by their demands. They want to force the British toconcede the major part of the Chinese market and to preserve China as an exclusive Japanese colony in fact ifnot in name, like her puppet state of Manchukuoand North China.</p><p>The British imperialists,purely for their own greedy ends, have been helping the struggle of Chiang KaiShek and the Chinese by supplying them with arms and other necessities importedthrough the foreign concessions and the treaty ports. The Japanese in returnfor minor concessions are demanding that all aid to Chinashall cease and that Britainexert pressure on the Chinese to force them to surrender.</p><p>The loathsome hypocrisy ofthe moral indignation shown by the British capitalist press at the &#8220;barbarism,&#8221;the &#8220;inhuman,&#8221; &#8220;uncivilised,&#8221; etc., conduct of the Japanese is shown by areport which has just come through of what is taking place in the British WestAfrican &#8220;Protectorate&#8221; of SierraLeone. In order to collect the monstrous andburdensome taxes inflicted on the natives, tortures and flogging are officiallyused on women as well as men in the best traditions of &#8220;Anglo-Saxon&#8221; gentlemethods of government.</p><p>The quarrel between Britain and Japan is a quarrel between two setsof thugs and gangsters over the division of the booty from the exploitation ofthe Chinese people. Because of her difficulties in Europe, Britain hasbeen attempting to make a robber&#8217;s agreement at the expense of the Chinesemasses. The motives which inspire the actions and diplomacy of Britain and other imperialist countries can beclearly seen in the horse deals which they are attempting to arrange behind thescenes in secret discussions at Tokyo.</p><p>Under these conditions theshameful role played by the &#8220;Labour&#8221; and &#8220;Communist&#8221; leaders is transparentlydemonstrated. Instead of exposing the economic and political motives of theactions of the British Government, they attempt to show themselves as betterand more zealous defenders of the &#8220;interests&#8221; of the British capitalists thanthe capitalists themselves. They are demanding a &#8220;firm&#8221; stand and no retreat inthe face of Japanese &#8220;insolence,&#8221; &#8220;protection&#8221; of the rights of Britain in China, that is, of the robbertreaties forced at the point of the bayonet on the Chinese. As if any actionundertaken by the imperialists can be for any purpose except the protection oftheir profits.</p><p>We must demand thecancellation of all privileges enjoyed by the British and other imperialistnations in China,and the handing over to the Chinese of the plunder wrung from them inimperialist wars of conquest. That is the way to strike a blow not only in favourof China,but against British capitalism as well. We cannot trust the British capitaliststo carry out any act in the interests of the workers of Britain and theworld.</p><p>We can help the Chinesepeople only by independent action. For the workers&#8217; boycott of Japan!Transport workers, Dockers, all workers must rely only on their own might byrefusing to handle goods to and from Japan.</p><p>The Far Eastern situationreveals the precarious state of the world. The imperialists are preparing tosacrifice the youth of all nations on the altar of profits. There is only oneroad for youth to travel, the road of unrelenting opposition to imperialism andcapitalism as the only way to abolish the nightmare of the world-wide slaughterwhich they are preparing for us. No support for imperialist war preparations,diplomacy or horse-deals!</p><p class="skip">&nbsp;</p><hr class="end" /><p class="footer"><a href="../../index.htm">Ted GrantArchive</a></p></body></html>
