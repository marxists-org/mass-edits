The leaders
of the Labour Party are wondering if they have been hit by an H-Bomb. The
discussion on this issue, which they had considered closed, has been re-opened
by the decisions of the two general workers&#8217; unions. In the past the leadership
has considered the votes of these two unions as automatically cast for right
wing policies. But even in the Right wing dominated General and Municipal
Workers&#8217; Union the feeling of the rank and
file has broken through.
</p>
<p>
The
dreadful threat posed to their families, their wives and children and workmates
by the horrors of the bomb has led to a mood of uneasiness within the ranks of
the organised labour movement. Due to the propaganda by the various
organisations such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament millions of people
now understand the terrible consequences of all out nuclear war.
</p>
<p>
This small
island with its compact industrial areas is the most vulnerable country in the
world to such an attack. If half a dozen bombs dropped in different parts of
the country, practically all life would be wiped-out. The few miserable
remnants would be unable to organise any civilised society. Thus the threat to
use the bomb first&#8212;or last&#8212;is a threat of suicide.
</p>
<p>
That is
why, at nearly every trade-union conference, discussion around the H-bomb has
figured so prominently. At the General and Municipal Workers&#8217; Union Conference
a resolution demanding the unilateral abolition of the bomb was carried by a
narrow majority.
</p>
<p>
At the
Trade and General Workers&#8217; Union Conference there were 9 resolutions on nuclear
weapons on the agenda. A composite supported by Cousins and the Executive
Committee made the following points: a permanent stopping of tests; a
declaration that nuclear weapons would never be used first by Britain or from
her territory; reaffirmation that suspension of tests means suspension of
production; discontinuance of patrols by British based aircraft carrying
hydrogen bombs; restoration of the principle of political control over the use
of weapons of mass destruction; objection to the setting up of missile bases in
Great Britain; and every effort to reach agreement on multi-lateral
disarmament, summit talks&#8230;
</p>
<p>
Cousins as
careful to emphasise that all the points in the Resolution were based on Labour
Party statements. &#8220;There is not one word here that comes from Frank Cousins,
not one word!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Even so
Gaitskell&#8217;s immediate and hostile reactions with his talk of &#8220;No one man
deciding the policy of the Labour Party,&#8221; shows the alarm in the ruling caucus
of the Labour Party. This is demonstrated too by the moves, quite
unprecedented, to reverse the decision of the General and Municipal Workers&#8217; Union, having a recall conference.
</p>
<p>
Moreover
Gaitskell has made it clear that even if he is defeated at the Annual
Conference he will still stick to the bomb. This attitude must set all Labour
Party members thinking about the problem of democracy in the movement. This
attitude, too, shows quite clearly who the real splitters are. Gaitskell and
company put their loyalty to the &#8220;cold war&#8221; policies of N.A.T.O. above that of
loyalty to democratic decisions of the movement.
</p>
<p>
Such a
policy is the &#8220;non-nuclear&#8221; club whereby Britain
would renounce and scrap atomic arms (leaving only America
and Russia
as atomic powers) in return for the agreement of all other powers not to test
or manufacture atomic weapons. The refusal of any power, such as France or China, to accept such a limitation,
would free the hands of the labour leadership to continue much on the lines
that the McMillan Government has done. It should never be forgotten that it was
the post-war Attlee Labour Government which secretly decided on the production
and testing of atomic bombs.
</p>
<p>
There ore
many points in the resolution of the Transport and General Workers&#8217; Union which
deserve support as steps towards a fully rounded socialist policy, such as the
demand for the stopping of tests, end the suspension of the production of
atomic bombs. But it stops snort of the unilateral renunciation of atomic
weapons, round which a mass campaign throughout the country could be waged. A
national campaign on these lines by the entire Labour movement would
undoubtedly rout the Tories at the polls. As Cousins pointed out, there are
large sections of the middle class who have moved on this question. The
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has gathered support from people who normally
vote for the Conservatives.
</p>
<p>
The points
put forward in the Transport and General Workers&#8217; Union resolution mark a step
forward from the point of view of placing the problem squarely before the entire
Labour movement. Many of the points should be supported by militants in the
Labour movement as a means of clarifying the whole problem.
</p>
<p>
But the
whole question really revolves round the fundamental problem of why wars take
place. The development of scientific means of exterminating and obliterating
whole populations, countries end even continents, does not take place by
chance. If not by atomic weapons, then by biological weapons and others almost
as deadly. It is due to the character of the century in which we live. The
suspicions, antagonisms, end hatreds do not arise arbitrarily from the ill will
and misunderstanding of individuals or groups in present day society.
</p>
<p>
They do not
arise out of individual likes or dislikes or misunderstandings. Nor are they
caused by the differences between &#8220;democracy&#8221; and dictatorship, as the
capitalist press pretends. The same governments which talk of defending
democracy find no difficulty in &#8220;defending&#8221; it in the company of dictators like
Chiang-Kai-Shek, Salazar, Franco and others of like kind.
</p>
<p>
The
fundamental antagonism in the present period is between Soviet bloc, in which
capitalism has been destroyed, and the Western bloc of imperialist powers led
by America.
In the past period the capitalist powers clashed because of the struggle for
markets, raw materials, colonies, and spheres of influence and investment. The
antagonisms between the capitalist powers remain, but these are subordinated to
the far greater antagonism between the two fundamental[ly
different] economic systems.
</p>
<p>
If there
has not been a clash long ago it has been because of the war-weariness of the
peoples of Western Europe and America,
and the strength of the strength of the organisations of the working class. But
over a long period of time it would be impossible to maintain the uneasy truce
or even the so-called &#8220;competitive coexistence&#8221;. The main factor preventing war
is the relationship of forces between the working class and the capitalist
class in the West.
</p>
<p>
No reliance
can be put on the governments of the world. The capitalist governments
represent the interests of the employers as a whole, and can no more serve the
needs of the working class or the mass of the people than employers represent
the interests of the workers in negotiations over wages and conditions. The
difference being that the issues involved are far greater when the government
represents the employers collectively. Nor can any trust be put in the
representatives of the Soviet bureaucracy, who are more interested in
safeguarding their privileges ant power than the interests of the Russian
working class. That is why they cannot allow real workers&#8217; democracy in the
Soviet bloc, but rule by totalitarian means. They are only too willing to
betray the working class of the capitalist countries and the colonial peoples,
in return for an agreement on the status quo with the capitalist powers.
</p>
<p>
There can
be no reliance on capitalist governments to serve the needs of the working
class. But that does not mean to say that the situation is hopeless. There is a
force far stronger even than the H-bomb or any other weapon of destruction: the
international solidarity of the working class. They have no interest in
destroying each other. On the contrary, their needs and interests are the same;
time and again the international interests of the working class have swept over
national barriers and frontiers. The latest example is the refusal of the West
German, French, Belgian and Dutch printers to blackleg on their striking
British brothers.
</p>
<p>
No
agreement on disarmament, atomic or otherwise, will bring peace to the peoples.
Agreement, in fact, will be at the expense of the workers of the world.
</p>
<p>
If the
leaders of the Labour movement were to present a concrete programme of complete
disarmament and a plan of production for the benefit of the peoples, they would
sweep the country. They could then appeal to the workers of the world on a
socialist basis.
