The decision by the National Coal
Board to close the 36 pits and throw 13,000 miners out of work, with only the
promise of re-employing 8,000 is now followed by their outright rejection of
the N.U.M. claim for a reduction of hours and increased holidays. This shows
that they mean business and are determined to carry out the Tory Government&#8217;s
plan of economising at the expense of the miners.
</p>
<p>
The
reaction of the leadership of the N.U.M., no matter how they wriggle, amounts
to accepting the position. They have decided to continue the policy decided
previously to &#8220;co-operate in minimising hardship caused by the closures&#8221;
despite the wave of unrest throughout the coalfields. The South Wales
delegation, at the January E.C., under heavy pressure from the militant Welsh
coalfields had moved that the Union disassociate itself entirely from the
closures. This was defeated by 24 votes - 3. This hardly constitutes a fighting
policy.
</p>
<p>
The rank and file have shown
signs of wanting stronger action. At a conference of 79 colliery lodges in S.
Wales and the Forest of Dean a decision was taken to &#8220;recommend&#8221; to the
official conference a policy of strike action. At the conference itself one
fifth of the delegates supported a token strike.
</p>
<p>
The bitterness
of the miners is particularly sharp because they remember that not so long ago
they were being exhorted to work extra shifts and work harder. Now they have
worked themselves out of their jobs. The number of miners in the pits is now
only 680,000, the lowest since 1900. Meanwhile the productivity of the miners
is the highest in Western Europe. But the miners in west Europe have gained
three weeks&#8217; holiday with pay.
</p>
<h4>The Miners&#8217; Charter</h4>
<p class="fst">
For ten
years the Miners&#8217; Charter has been on the books of the N.U.M. The 7-hour day
underground, 40-hour week for surface workers, three weeks&#8217; holiday with pay.
The E.C. announced that they would put forward these demands. But as long ago
as 1919 the miners had won the 7-hour day. Only to have it taken away from them
in the general offensive of the employers, especially the coal-owners, culminating
in the general strike of 1926.
</p>
<p>
The Miners&#8217;
Union E.C., have decided to hold a National conference to discuss ways and
means of saving Miners&#8217; jobs. Far more to the point would be to prepare a
programme of action on a national scale.
</p>
<p>
In the two
areas worst affected Scotland and South Wales, Communist Party members hold
leading positions in the N.U.M. and they have organised a campaign of protest
meetings, lobbyings of Parliament, etc., etc. However the main consideration of
the Communist Party is to ensure the election of their candidate for the
General Secretaryship of the N.U.M., William Paynter. That is probably why they
have defeated the moves to take more militant action, e.g., demonstration
strikes.
</p>
<h4>Give a lead</h4>
<p class="fst">
Demonstrations,
the lobbying of Parliament are very good, but the limitation of this kind of
action must be recognised. In the last analysis all this kind of action shows
is that miners are opposed to being sacked.
</p>
<p>
Even the
best of the demonstrations like the monster ones held in South Wales do not
really worry the Coal Board or the Tories. What must be demonstrated is that
the miners are willing to fight, to strike if necessary. Arguments advanced
against this on the grounds of <em>Unity</em>,
presuppose that no campaign of explanation takes place. The Yorkshire miners,
the Notts. and Derbyshire miners will understand if it&#8217;s put to them in a class
way that their interests are those of the sacked miners. They will understand that
if the N.C.B. and the Tories get away with this that the next step is an attack
on all miners&#8217; conditions. Workers in other industries, too, despite all the
propaganda, will understand that the defeat of the miners in this struggle will
be followed by an assault on all workers&#8217; hours and wages. Anyone with the
slightest knowledge of the history of the movement knows this, more shame to
those trade union &#8220;leaders&#8221; who have given no lead on the question.
</p>
<p>
More
fundamental problems are posed too, it is not the miners who are responsible
for the crisis in the industry. It is not the working class. It is the
responsibility of the capitalist system of production for profit. Why should
the workers suffer for no fault of their own? Let the ruling class bear the burden
of the crisis. The ex coal-owners are getting compensation even for those pits
that have been closed down. Cut the compensation to the level of wages earned
by the miners! Work or full wages for all miners must be the demand. Cut the
hours and ban all overtime.
</p>
<p>
The miners
in S. Wales say that the pits being closed are not as uneconomic as the Coal
Board argues. There is only one way to meet this situation. The Coal Board
represents the interests of the employers and the State. Only when the trade
unions have a majority of the representatives elected through the trade unions,
and responsible to the workers, will decisions be taken for the benefit of the
miners and the working class as a whole.
