<p class="fst">It is necessary, at various stages, to re-examine and analyse the principles,
policies and tactics of the Movement both for the benefit of new members, and to
consolidate and refresh the ideas of the basic cadres. In the light of recent
events (Newsletter Industrial Conference, formation of the Socialist
Labour League), and because of the relative lull in the Labour Party at the
present time, this seems to be a suitable time to re-examine some of our basic
conceptions on the problems of work in Britain.</p>

<p>To the sectarian splinter groups on the edge of, or to the left of the
Fourth International (the Workers League, the Socialist Workers Federation
and other tiny grouplets), the problem is posed in the simplest of terms: the
Social Democracy and Stalinism have betrayed the working class; therefore the
independent party of the working class must immediately be built. They
claim the independence of the revolutionary party as a principle,
whether the party consists of two or two million.</p>

<p>They do not take into account the historical development of the movement of
the working class, which conditions the tactics, while maintaining the
principles of the Marxists. Without flexible tactics it is impossible to win or
train the forces which must be won before a revolutionary party can be built.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the movement of the working class does not proceed in a
straight line. Otherwise, all that would be necessary would be to proclaim
from the street corners the need for a revolutionary party &#8211; as the SPGB has
proclaimed for 50 years the superiority of Socialism over capitalism &#8211; but with
completely barren results.</p>

<p>We have to start with an understanding of the working class and the Labour
Movement as it emerges historically, with the consciousness determined by
objective conditions on the one hand, and the betrayal of Stalinism and Social
Democracy, which for us are objective factors, on the other hand; and the
weakness of the revolutionary forces, which also becomes an important factor of
the historical process. How to overcome the weakness and isolation of the
revolutionary movement, whilst maintaining its principles intact, is the basic
task of this epoch.</p>

<p>Alas! The movement of the working class rarely moves in a straight line.
Otherwise capitalism would have been overthrown decades ago. The betrayal of the
Revolution by Social Democracy in 1914-20 led to the formation of the Communist
International, which was intended as an organ of World Revolution. The
degeneration of the Revolution and the subsequent betrayal of Stalinism had its
consequence that the world proletariat was disorientated.</p>

<p>However, it is one thing for the cadres of the revolutionary movement to
understand the role of Stalinism and Reformism; it is a different matter for the
masses, and even for the active advanced guard, who in general only learn by
experience.</p>

<p>The victory of Hitler and the failure of the CI [Communist International] to learn the lessons of these
events, marked the end of the CI as a weapon for the overthrow of capitalism and
the inauguration of a new society leading to the setting up of a Socialist
system.</p>

<p>It was this that led the Left Opposition to declare for the formation of new
revolutionary parties and the new International. Neither the Labour Party nor
the Communist Party could serve the needs of the Socialist revolution. But it
is a long way from proclaiming the need for a revolutionary party to being able
to form one with a mass basis.</p>

<p>Historically, the Marxist Movement has been thrown back. It is isolated from
the main currents of opinion within the Labour Movement itself.</p>

<p>It was under these conditions that the problem of Entrism was raised by
Trotsky. It is significant too, that it was first raised in relation to problems
in Britain, which perhaps is a pointer to future perspectives.</p>

<p>Here we can only give a brief sketch of the history of entrism in Britain,
dealing with the most important points only, which are of interest for the
purposes of clarification and discussion.</p>

<p>The question was first raised in relation to work in the Independent Labour
Party.</p>

<p>As a result of the experience of the Labour government of 1929-31 and world
events of that period, the catastrophic slump, the rise of Fascism in Germany,
faith in Reformism was shattered among many sections of the movement. Opposition
to the policy of surrender and retreat of the MacDonald government crystallised,
in the Labour Party, within the ranks of the ILP.</p>

<p>The ILP split from the Labour Party (on the wrong issue, at the wrong time,
and without mobilising support in the broad Labour Movement). This meant that
tens of thousands of workers organised in the ILP were moving in a revolutionary
direction, away from Reformism and towards Marxism. At this stage their ideas
were muddled; half revolutionary, half reformist. They could be won for the
revolutionary programme, be absorbed by the perversions of Stalinism, move back
to reformism, or lapse into apathy. The issue was not at all a settled one.</p>

<p>In 1932 the Trotskyists in Britain had been expelled from the Communist Party
(for advocating a united front with the socialists in Germany and Britain). They
launched a monthly paper but still remained isolated from the mainstream of the
working class movement. Under these conditions, Trotsky suggested to the British
comrades that the most fruitful field of work in Britain would be among the
leftward moving workers in the ILP.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the most experienced leaders of the Movement resisted and
tried to maintain an independent organisation (not for very long &#8211; they soon
entered the Labour Party, and later their organisation was dissolved) and only
the younger and less experienced entered the ILP. Only modest successes were
recorded. In the next period the ILP began to melt away as a serious force due
to vacillations and the confusion of the leadership.</p>

<p>By 1935 the Labour Movement had began to recover from the debacle of 1931.
And with the decline of the ILP and the prospect of only negligible further
gains, if not losses, in this stagnant milieu, Trotsky raised the question of
entry work in the Labour Party. The successes of the LP in the local elections,
the strikes, the possibility of civil war which seemed to loom ahead &#8211; all would
have their reflection in the ranks of the LP and make the best elements
receptive to revolutionary ideas. However, they would not listen to a tiny
organisation outside the mainstream of the Labour Movement. The problems of
building the revolutionary tendency was the problem of penetrating the Labour
Movement, especially the politically-conscious sections organised in the Labour
Party. The LP, as the political expression of the organised trade union
movement, represented the organised working class and sections of the
unorganised workers as well. Thus the only way in which the work of
revolutionists would not be stultified was within the mass milieu. We must learn
to express revolutionary ideas in a language workers would understand,
skillfully fighting the Reformists step by step, but without abandoning
revolutionary ideas or perspectives.</p>

<p>Comrade Trotsky suggested bringing the experience of entry into the ILP to a
close, and conducting work in the Labour Party.</p>

<p>The history of the subsequent period demonstrates that at that stage this was
the correct tactic.</p>

<p>The working class does not come to revolutionary conclusions easily. Habits
of thought, traditions, the exceptional difficulties created by the
transformation of the Socialist and Communist traditional organisations into
obstacles on the road of the revolution; all these have put formidable obstacles
in the way of creating a Marxist mass movement.</p>

<p>All history demonstrates that, at the first stages of revolutionary upsurge,
the masses turn to the mass organisations to try and find a solution for their
problems, especially the young generation, entering politics for the first time.
The experience of many countries demonstrates this. In Germany, despite the fact
that the Spartacists represented tens of thousands of revolutionary workers
steeled in the struggle against the First World War, and despite the fact that
the Social Democratic leadership betrayed the workers in supporting the war and
opposing the revolution of 1918, it was to the latter that the workers first
turned after the outbreak of the revolution. It required years of revolutionary
and counter-revolutionary struggles (apart from the mistakes of the leadership)
before the CP was transformed from a small party to a mass movement.</p>

<p>This experience of every revolutionary awakening in the last 50 years in
Europe demonstrates the truth of this theory. With the tiny forces we are able
to mobilise at the moment, it would be laughable to suppose that the development
of the revolution in Britain will follow any other course. Even as an
independent force &#8211; if we had the forces and resources &#8211; it would be necessary
to take this process into account. How much more so when, in relation to the
problems posed by history, as yet we are a tiny handful. The task is to convert
this handful into an integrated group with roots in the mass movement and then,
from a cadre organisation, into a wider grouping, leading to the development of
a mass organisation. How this is to be done is the main tactical consideration
which dominates the work of the organisation at this stage.</p>

<p>Turning back to the historical question of entrism. From 1936-9 this problem
was posed by the developments in Britain. It is not our intention to deal with
the disputes of that period within the Movement, which are only of historical
interest. But the outbreak of war in 1939 cut across the process and gave a
different turn to events.</p>

<p>And here the problem of tactics as tactics, and not as once-and-for-all
fetishes, shows its real importance. The Labour and trade union leaders entered a
coalition with the capitalist class, and at a later stage entered the government
under Churchill. The Labour organisations declined in activity and as live,
functioning organisations. The youth was in the armed forces. Later, the CP,
with the entry of Russia into the war, became the most zealous strike-breaking
organisation. This gave tremendous opportunities for independent work. The
biggest successes of Trotskyism in Britain were obtained during this period. The
WIL, which formed the main part of the Revolutionary Communist Party at the
fusion of Trotskyist forces in 1944, had changed its tactics in the early part
of the war as a result of the experience of the objective situation. From the
militants in industry and the trade unions the beginnings of a vanguard were
created. But even at the height of the successes of the RCP, in discussion of
the problems of entrism, the basic question of the probable entry of the
revolutionary forces into the LP was posed. In discussions on the question, it
was explained that even if a small party of a couple of thousands were to be
created, it would not be sufficient for the tasks posed by history. If a Left
Wing of some tens of thousands were to arise in the LP under the hammer blows of
events it would be necessary, where affiliation could not be obtained, to enter
for the purpose of influencing these elements into moving in a revolutionary
direction; though, of course, at that stage the main emphasis was on the
building of an independent party.</p>

<p>Events on a world scale took a different direction than was or could be
foreseen by the Trotskyists in the prewar period. Stalinism in Russia and the
East, Reformism and Stalinism in the West, were temporarily strengthened by a
whole series of factors.</p>

<p>In Britain, this was reflected in the victory of the Labour government.
Coming to power at a time of boom caused by the destruction of war, the Labour
government of 1945 functioned under entirely different conditions from those
under the Labour government of 1929. The ruling class had lost confidence as a
result of the changed status of Britain in the world. Nominally a victor,
Britain had nothing but losses to put in its balance sheet as a result of the
war. The basic industries had been allowed to decay, with antiquated equipment,
and starved of capital. For Britain to compete in the markets of the world
she needed cheap coal, transport, steel, electricity, etc. Private enterprise
would not have been willing to lay out the enormous sums required to modernise
these industries. Hence the tolerance, or lukewarm opposition of the capitalists
to the nationalisation of industries. The wave of revolutionary awakening had
spread all over Asia, including India. The ruling class realised the
impossibility of holding down these areas without a long and full scale war,
which Britain could not sustain. Hence the conceding of control to the Indian,
Burmese and Ceylonese capitalist classes. With the huge profits being made by
big business, and on the basis of expanded economic activity, crumbs could be
afforded as concessions to the working classes. On this basis, the Labour
leaders, in the early years at any rate, could introduce certain reforms, such
as the National Health scheme. The loans and Marshall Aid extended by America
also bolstered up the economy. American capitalism had no alternative than to
underwrite the British Labour government. But the fact that in large measure the
Labour government had carried out its programme and that, thanks to overtime,
women working, bonus schemes and a sellers market with the chronic shortage
of labour, conditions improved in comparison with prewar, especially with the
disappearance of unemployment, meant that illusions in reformism were
strengthened within the organised working class. Thus the opposite condition
prevailed than had prevailed with a Labour government working under conditions
of slump.</p>

<p>Under such conditions, the revolutionary tendency tended to become isolated.
This is not the time nor the place for an analysis of the mistakes of the RCP
and the Movement generally at that time. But one thing has been demonstrated by
historical events; the conditions for entry, as worked out by Trotsky in the
past, did not apply. These conditions can be summarised as:</p>

<p class="indent">(a) Pre-revolutionary or revolutionary situation.</p>

<p class="indent">(b) Ferment in Social Democracy.</p>

<p class="indent">(c) Development of a Left Wing.</p>

<p class="indent">(d) The possibility of the rapid crystallisation of the revolutionary
tendency.</p>

<p>None of these conditions existed at the time. Healyites in the RCP first
raised the question. Their perspectives were false. By 1950 they were explaining
in a document for their Congress that the issue was Socialism or Fascism within
a year. There were to be no more general Elections, etc. Their perspective was
based on a complete misjudgement of the situation.</p>

<p>However, once the RCP had dissolved and all the forces of Trotskyism were in
the Labour Party, the problem of how to work in the party and with what
perspective was a very vital one. It is necessary to understand that our own
forces are too weak to create a left wing of mass proportions. Our job is to win
over the most advanced elements and create cadres within the Party. At the same
time, on the basis of our work and our political positions, gaining positions in
the local Labour Parties, Wards, General Management Committees, etc. This is all
preparatory work for the major job in the future. On the other hand, to dress
ourselves in the clothes of Left Reformism over a period would be disastrous.
All the adventures of the Healyites in this respect ended ingloriously. It is
true that the conditions for entry, as Trotsky outlined them, are still not
present, but it would be the height of stupidity to abandon work in the LP now
and launch into independent adventures after a decade or more of work
there. The conditions for independent work are not favourable either. Whatever
may have been gained by remaining independent in the past, tremendous gains
cannot be expected in the immediate future. For any such gains would be
disproportionate to the future possibilities in the Labour Party.</p>

<p>In the meantime, to launch out with the main emphasis on independent work
would damage the future work that could be conducted in the Labour Party. Thus
we would obtain the worst disadvantages of both tactics. It will not be possible
to re-enter easily under conditions of ferment in the LP, as Transport House
would have a list of all prominent Trotskyists in the past period.</p>

<p>In any event, it is really an extraordinary performance when the objective
situation is on the eve of transformation in the next period both nationally and
internationally, with tremendous repercussions within the ranks of the Labour
Movement, to abandon the field just when the possibility will develop for really
fruitful work. Trotsky had explained how, in preparing for entry, people should
be sent in to get the feel, see what the possibilities were, etc. Our [task] now
consists of preparatory work for the next period. If we were an independent
organisation at the present time we should be preparing our forces for entry.
Far from withdrawing, we would be sending in more and more of our forces to
prepare the way for total entry. Our forces in the LP would be able to inform us
of the situation there, and at the first signs of a gathering storm we would
have entered. Under the circumstances it is the height of folly, irresponsible
ultra-leftism, to launch an adventure at the present time: an adventure that
will favour Transport House in its endeavours to shackle the Left Wing. Nothing
will be gained in the long run, and a great deal of damage will be done to the
work in the Labour Party.</p>

<p>In addition, the rank and file would be entirely miseducated by these
constant somersaults, and a demoralisation of the members would ensue. From
every point of view the work is impossible without an understanding of the
perspectives, whatever the momentary situation may be. Otherwise the work
proceeds purely empirically as with the Healyites, in a series of convulsive
leaps and jumps in all directions. The tendency is at the mercy of every
episodic conjuncture and turn in events, blown hither and thither by momentarily
favourable or unfavourable winds, instead of &#8211; while taking these into account
in every-day work and explaining to the membership the meaning of all event &#8211;
nevertheless fitting them into broad perspectives of the movement. It is the
failure to understand the tactic of entrism, and its application, which has
resulted in the new tactics of the Healyites. They will produce an abortion.</p>

<p>Our job in the preparatory period, which still exists, is the patient
winning of ones and twos, perhaps of small groups, but certainly not the
creation of a mass revolutionary current, which is not possible at the present
time. To attempt to shout louder than one&rsquo;s voice merely results in
hoarseness and ultimately the loss of voice altogether. We have to establish
ourselves as a tendency in the Labour Movement.</p>

<p>Opportunism is only the other side of adventurism. Both rise out of a false
assessment of objective circumstances, or of a surrender to the immediate
environment. That is why, without a firm theoretical basis and collective
control of the movement, it is easy to succumb to one mistake or the other, from
opportunist LP and TU tactics (the drive in the ETU and other unions for the
elections of officials for the sake of capturing positions, without putting
forward a clear revolutionary platform, and for horsedeals with all sorts of
peculiar elements). Having burned their fingers, it is natural for the Healyites
to recoil to ultra-leftism. The ostensible reason for rejecting any unity
discussions whatsoever with the RSL was that the latter was in favour of a
certain amount of open revolutionary work, all the work nevertheless being
centred in the LP. Now we have the foolish tactics in the South Bank strike, the
hysterical and meaningless rank and file committees (dealt with in the
statement on the Newsletter Industrial Conference) embracing all trades and all
sections of the workers. This has not succeeded in attracting more than a small
section of the militants, but it has succeeded in jeopardising the future of
work in the Labour Party.</p>

<p>With the Healyites, adventurism has gone hand in hand with opportunism. The
support for splitting the dock workers in Liverpool, which has had such
disastrous consequences, side by side with the opportunist tactics in the ETU.</p>

<p>For a quarter of the century or more the Labour bureaucracy has accumulated
experience in fighting entrist and fraction work by the CP. In this struggle
they have built a formidable machine skilled in fighting infiltration. To
this must be added a decade of experience in fighting Trotskyism in the
LP. This puts quite big difficulties in the way of organising on a national
scale. That is why the tactics of the Healyites were irresponsible in the last
period. If Transport House have held their hand until recently, only preparing
for action against individuals, it is because they feel secure in their
position. At the present time, with the capitulation of the Bevanites (apart
from the ineffective Victory for Socialism group), the bureaucracy feels
itself relatively secure. It is attempting to smother any opposition by calling
for a rallying of the membership for a campaign to defeat the Tories in the
coming general Election.</p>

<p>For a time it may succeed, or partially succeed, in this. The publication of
the glossy pamphlet on Labour&rsquo;s election programme will secure acceptance by
at least the bulk of the membership in the hope that, with the election of the
Labour government, things will undoubtedly improve.</p>

<p>It is just at this time that entry work in the LP will assume the utmost
importance. For the first time, important gains will be possible on a national
scale in the next period. Yet it is just at this time that the Healyites have in
action shown their despair at achieving results. This arises from their
previously incorrect perspectives, when they saw a mass Left Wing in every
incident which developed in the LP in the last decade.</p>

<p>As things stand, it seems likely that Labour will win the next election,
especially if the economy remains stagnant and unemployment reaches a million or
thereabouts during the winter. Labour&rsquo;s programme has something for everybody
in it, and Gaitskell&rsquo;s demagogic speeches on the television and in the country
will have been noted by the rank and file. Should Labour win the next election,
the bill will be presented by the workers accordingly. The advanced elements in
the unions and LP will demand steps in the direction of socialism. The
capitalists will be exerting pressure in their turn on the government, and the
Labour leaders will be left floundering, with their reformist programme in
tatters, in the middle. The political perspective of the next Labour government
will rather be that of 1929 than that of 1945.</p>

<p>The demands of the workers, in the unions and the LPs, will gather strength
and momentum, after the first period of shock and waiting watchfully for the
promises of the Labour leaders to be carried out. The mass of the working class
learns only from experience. This applies also to the more active and advanced
elements in general, apart from the Marxist wing who are guided by theoretical
calculations. The bulk of the nascent Left Wing are guided by practical
considerations, and will judge the Movement according to the results achieved.
However, they will be a receptive and attentive audience when reformism fails to
deliver the goods.</p>

<p>Under conditions of crisis and struggle, there will be renewal of the entire
Labour Movement. Shop stewards who have grown old and subservient to the
management in those plants where relatively good conditions have been obtained
in the past period will be shouldered out and replaced by younger militants; the
local TU branch officials who do not reflect the changed mood of the workers
will be removed. Delegates to the GMCs and city LPs from the TUs who today
generally almost select themselves, because of the prevailing indifference in
the union branches, would have to reflect the mood or find themselves removed.
The wards and GMCs would reflect the new mood, and a strong, leftward moving
opposition would develop. In any case the working class will fight, and the
development of struggle will revitalise and renew the Movement; especially the
youth, from whom the most gains have been made in the past period of work, would
become radicalised and look for a Left Wing alternative.</p>

<p>Under such conditions a strong Left Reformist or even Centrist current, with
a mass base, would be formed within the LP: a current similar to that which
developed in the LP during the second Labour government, when they moved away
from reformism. Had there been a Marxist wing, or even a strong fraction working
within this milieu, the basis could have been laid for the development of the
revolutionary party. A similar opportunity will reoccur in the new
circumstances. This is the historical justification for the policy of entrism.</p>

<p>We will intervene in this current and try and fertilise it with the ideas of
Marxism. The conservative outlook of the British working class and Labour
Movement, which is historically conditioned by the developments of the last
decades, can quickly disappear under the hammer blow of events. The advanced
elements will be willing to listen to revolutionary ideas which can show a way
out of the impasse in which the LP will find itself as a result of the policies
of the leadership. Reformism will appear bankrupt to this important layer of the
working class.</p>

<p>In this connection there is the lesson of the experience in the post-war
period. Under the impetus of the revolutionary wave which swept Italy, the
Social Democracy split between right and left, under Nenni. However, without any
real revolutionary alternative presented to them, the movement was captured and
became a fellow-travelling satellite of the Stalinists.</p>

<p>A similar danger exists in Britain, despite the strong anti-Stalinist
reaction which followed the Hungarian events. What there is of a Left Wing is
permeated by Stalinist ideas, especially on the question of foreign policy.
Outside the LP, with the aid of the large number of fellow travellers and
disguised Stalinists, unless they were actively combated within the Party, they
might succeed in gaining control and stultifying the Movement. On the other hand
any opposition Left Reformist current, which might under the hammer blow of
events even split from the LP, could not maintain itself for long. It would
either make the transition to a revolutionary position, lapse back into
Reformism or rapidly disintegrate. Our epoch has no room for centrist formations
of the lasting character. That is why the perspective for the next period opens
up the prospect for entrist work to be really fruitful.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the failure of the Labour Leaders to offer a bold
Socialist alternative, even in reformist terms, to the policy and programme of
Toryism; their feeble opposition in Parliament; their failure to mobilise the
workers for a real drive to get rid of the government, results in the
unprecedented victory of the government in three General Elections, it will not
alter perspectives in fundamentals. The struggle of the workers will then be in
extra parliamentary terms on the industrial field. The Labour and TU bureaucrats
under these circumstances would be compelled to swing Left, and swing the Party,
at least in words, for a socialist struggle against the Tory government. The
rank and file would be thoroughly roused and critical. Under conditions of
struggle a Left Wing would rapidly be crystallised. Against an aroused working
class the Tory government, after testing out the resistance of the workers, at a
certain stage, depending on the economic situation would, if the opposition of
the working class threatened to become too strong, with the government losing
its support, try to bridle the masses through a Labour government. This is to
prepare the way for reaction, and for more ruthless methods against the working
class. On the other hand, if the Tories try to slug it out with the
working class, this would be bound to be reflected within the ranks of the
working class, and thus of the LP. The rank and file would become critical of
the lack of fight of the leadership, and a ferment would commence in the ranks,
leading to the development of Left Wing and revolutionary conclusions.</p>

<p>In any event the perspective is of a heightened class struggle finding its
reflection within the ranks of the Labour Movement. This must be the basic
perspective that we set ourselves.</p>

<p>Our day to day work within the TU branches and LP Wards and GMCs must be
imbued with these ideas. At the present time, the Transport House bureaucracy
relies only on a thin stratum of its members for its machine. The experience of
the last decade has had its effect on the rank and file. Largely it is the full
time officials and councillors on whom Transport House relies for its support.
Not even on all these. Quite a big section, in various [local] Parties, supports the
Left. Under conditions of crises, this stratum whose horizon is bounded by the
routine of local affairs, would be affected by the mood of the rank and file.
Meanwhile the weight of the bureaucracy is on this stratum, and the <em>Wilson
Report</em>, with its separation in many instances of Trades Council from LPs, its
breaking up of City LPs and greater emphasis on the Constituency Parties, lowers
the specific weight of the TU delegate and raises the weight of the Constituency
Party machine.</p>

<p>The Party requires the renovating breezes of the class struggle, which will
put all shades and gradings in the party to the test.</p>

<p>We must look forward with confidence in our day to day patient work in Wards,
GMCs, Trades Councils and Shop Stewards committees. Our general perspectives
must at each stage be viewed in the light of events for the purpose of checking,
renewing, correcting or extending the basic prognoses, as the cases may be.</p>

<p>One thing is sure. The present swing to the right in France and Europe, to a
certain extent even Britain, will be succeeded by a terrific swing to the left.
Events,events,events, will shake the LP to its foundations. The LPs and TUs will
become forums for revolutionary discussion. The stagnant atmosphere in the party
and country will be transformed.</p>

<p>As the result of the betrayals of the Bevanites, some of the Lefts have
become discouraged and tend to drop out of the Party. They will be replaced by
dozens, hundreds, and thousands of militants in the period that looms ahead. The
experience of a strike is a valuable analogy. Every militant who has
participated in a strike has experienced the quickening effect on the
consciousness of the workers. They learn eagerly and quickly. In the course of
action and discussion, they learn in days and weeks what might otherwise take
years.</p>

<p>On a national scale, especially with Labour in power, with the remorseless
pressure of the class struggle pitilessly putting all programmes and
perspectives to the test, the result will be the same. The exceptionally
favourable conditions that bolstered reformism in 1945 are extremely unlikely
ever to recur in exactly the same form.</p>

<p>By working with the rank and file to return a Labour government, while
criticising the inadequacies of the programme, at this stage we can prepare our
basis in the areas where we work. Our day to day work must be linked with our
perspectives indissolubly.</p>

<p>The most vital need for all revolutionists is a proper sense of proportion.
On the one hand to have a proper sense of history &#8211; without this we are lost &#8211;
on the other hand to find a bridge to the future, taking into account the
present relaxation of forces. Our present forces and resources are extremely
small. That has been the curse of the epoch. From our present forces and tasks
we must work out a day to day perspective, without succumbing to the reformist
environment which presses down on us in the present period.</p>

<p>The theoretical and independent work of education of our own forces
must proceed simultaneously with our work in the LP. The one is as important as
the other. Either on its own is inadequate if we are to fulfil the role laid on
us by history.</p>
