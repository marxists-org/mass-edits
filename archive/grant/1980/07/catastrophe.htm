<p class="fst">
British
capitalism has been declining for more than a century now. Since the
Second World War and loss of empire the decline of Britain&rsquo;s power
has continued at a headlong rate.
</p>
<p>
The
sluggishness of the ruling class, due to centuries of superiority and
domination over a great part of the world, has led to a situation
where the British capitalists are incapable of stemming the tide of
decay and disintegration which has overtaken them.
</p>
<p>
The
contradictions within the framework of capitalism itself are of such
a character as to increase the difficulties. The differing interests
represented by rent, interest and profit (i.e. the bankers, the land
owners, property owners, owners of factories etc. on the one hand,
and the interests of the industrialists on the other hand) have to a
great extent entered into conflict with one another. As a consequence
of the policies of successive governments during the past decade or
two, high interest rates and high rents have vitiated the development
of industry.
</p>
<p>
People
with surplus money have found it better to invest in property
speculation and service trades such as tourism rather than investing
in manufacturing industry. Manufacturing industry has become the
Cinderella of the business world.
</p>
<p>
The
bourgeoisie has forgotten completely that the production of real
wealth is the production of manufacturing industry. They are more
interested in the chase after nominal gains, rather than genuine
gains for the economy itself.
</p>
<p>
As
a consequence of the failure of the ruling class to invest in
manufacturing industry, at a time when trade barriers have been
reduced to a greater extent than at any other period in capitalist
history, as exemplified by GATT and the Common Market and other
impediments to trade which have been reduced, the opening of free
trade has not given a boost to competition by the British capitalists
as the strategists of capital confidently expected, but has
accelerated the decay and disintegration of British industry.
</p>
<p>
From
only 5 percent of the industrial production of the OECD powers in
1978, by the end of 1979 the share of British capitalism has been
reduced to only 4 percent. From a medium range power, Britain has
been rapidly reduced to the level of a small industrial power.
</p>
<p>
West
Germany&rsquo;s industrial production is now more than double that of
Britain&rsquo;s. France has outstripped her, and even Italy must be very
close to the figures of output of British capitalism at the moment.
In volume of output, China and India have outstripped Britain
completely.
</p>
<p>
Steel
production has always been taken as an index of industrial capacity
and last year Britain produced 21 million tonnes against Italy&rsquo;s 24
million, France&rsquo;s 27 million and Japan&rsquo;s more than 100 million.
This year according to projected figures of output Britain&rsquo;s steel
production should only be round about a total of 17-18 million tonnes
while the projected output of steel in China this year is now 33
million tonnes. That is to say that China&rsquo;s production of steel
will now be almost double that of the output of Britain. Yet
production of steel in Britain in the inter-war period and the
immediate post-war period was much higher than that of most of the
industrial countries of the world.
</p>
<p>
Take
world exports of manufactures. In 1963 the United States had 17.34
percent of world export markets. This had declined by 1973 to 12.58
percent and in 1976 this had increased slightly to 13.55 percent.
West Germany increased from 15.53 percent in 1963 to 16.98 percent in
1973 and in 1976 the figure was 15.81 percent. France has outstripped
Britain as far as exports in manufactures are concerned. From 6.99
percent in 1963 France increased her share to 7.26 percent in 1973
and 7.41 percent in 1976.
</p>
<h4>Deindustrialisation</h4>
<p class="fst">
Even
Italy increased her share from 4.73 percent in 1963 to 5.30 percent
in 1973 and 5.49 percent [in] 1976, whereas the UK started in third
place in 1963 with only West Germany and the United States with
greater exports. Britain at that time had 11.14 percent of world
exports of manufactures; by 1973 this had been reduced to 7 percent
and 1976 6.59 percent and a further decline of the percentage of
world exports would mean that even Italy must come close and threaten
to replace Britain as an exporter of manufactured goods.
</p>
<p>
If
we take the figures of employment in industry where there has been a
massive de-industrialisation in Britain, we see that the figures of
employment have been falling. 1.5 million jobs have been lost in
manufacturing industry in the course of the last 15 years. That has
now been reinforced by the measures of the Thatcher government
preparing the way for an absolute catastrophe for British capitalism.
</p>
<p>
The
relatively slow growth in productivity of British industry can be
seen by comparing the increases in gross domestic product (GDP) per
capita between 1950 and 1976 for selected countries. The figures for
GDP per capita are compared to the USA in 1950 and 1976 both given as
100. The increases in nominal and real GDP (the latter taking
inflation into account) are also compared.
</p>
<p>
Between
1950 and 1976 Germany increased from 37 percent of the USA figure to
76.4 percent in real terms and 94.4 percent nominally. Germany
therefore practically doubled her GDP per capita in relation to the
GDP of the USA taking the US figure as a yardstick.
</p>
<p>
France
increased from 46 percent to 78.5 percent in real GDP and 83 percent
in nominal terms. Japan increased (from 1970 in this case) from 57.7
percent to 64.3 percent, and nominally by 62.2 percent. Italy
increased from 25 percent to 46.8 percent in real terms and 38.7
percent nominally. Italy has almost doubled her GDP per capita in
relation to the USA. Spain increased (from 1970 again) from 39.7
percent to 43.8 percent in real terms and 37 percent nominally.
</p>
<p>
For
comparison: in 1970 India&rsquo;s GDP per capita was 6.1 percent of that
of the USA, by 1976 it was still only 5.6 percent in real terms and
1.9 percent nominally. Britain&rsquo;s GDP per capita increased from 55
percent of the US level in 1950 to 60.1 percent of the US level in
1976 in real terms, nominally declining to 51 percent.
</p>
<p>
Despite
the complete parasitism of monopoly capitalism in Britain at the
present time, and the lavish subsidies and inducements by the state,
a recovery of investment has still not taken place. For instance
since 1972 all investment in plant and machinery has been 100 percent
deductible from tax. Despite enormous subsidies and other concessions
which would mean that more than 60 percent probably of investment in
manufacturing industry would be paid for by the state, nevertheless
the investment has not been forthcoming.
</p>
<p>
The
British economy has been practically at a standstill for ten years,
thus making Britain fall further and further behind in the last
decade. In 1970 total investment of manufacturing industry in plant
and machinery at 1975 prices was &pound;4,177 million. By 1973 this had
fallen to &pound;3,439.8 million and in 1974 &pound;3,781.8 million. By 1979
this had only risen by an infinitesimal amount to &pound;3,840.8 million,
a figure that was lower than the figure of investment of 1978 which
reached &pound;3,852.6 million (all figures in 1975 prices).
</p>
<p>
Steel
production in 1970 was the highest that has been achieved by British
capitalism, 27,792,000 tonnes in 53 weeks. In 1974 in the year of the
three-day week it still reached 22,323, 000 tonnes but in 1979 the
figure was less than 21 million tonnes and in 1980 it is expected
that steel production will fall by a further 2 or 3 million tonnes.
</p>
<p>
Despite
the fact that Britain has been in almost permanent recession because
of the policies of the governments that have been dictated by the
crisis and, on the other hand, because of the failure of British
capitalism to adapt to the difficult conditions posed by fierce
international competition, the economy and industrial production have
not increased at a rate comparable to that of her rivals. However, in
spite of the antiquated machinery that is used in Britain at the
present time the productivity of those employed in manufacturing
industry has nevertheless increased.
</p>
<p>
If
we take 1975 as 100 it had increased by 1979 to 109.6, which is quite
a high rate of increase. Even from 1974, the year of the three-day
week, to 1979 there was an 11 percent increase in output per person
in manufacturing industry.
</p>
<p>
Capital
expenditure in manufacturing industry in 1970 was &pound;4,177 million,
but the estimated figure for 1980 in 1975 prices would be &pound;3,450
million&mdash;quite a steep fall. On the other hand, investment in
distribution and services has leapt ahead. &pound;3,610 million was
invested in 1970, and an estimated &pound;5,400 million in 1980.
</p>
<p>
If
we were to take current (i.e. 1980) prices, the expenditure on
manufacturing industries, in capital expenditure, is expected to be
&pound;6,500 million and &pound;10,000 million in the distribution and service
industries, which means an even wider gap. Not only has there been
massive investment in services and distribution in the UK, but also
in overseas investment, &pound;2,400 million in 1978 which was &pound;600
million higher than in 1977, and in 1979 the figure must have been
higher still with perspectives of even greater sums flowing abroad in
1980.
</p>
<p>
After
the Second World War the capitalist class, faced with the possibility
of socialist revolution in Europe and the rise of a mighty Stalinist
power in Russia, with Russia as the second world power, had to alter
their methods. This led to a situation where the ruling class tried
to find a way out of the impasse of capitalism.
</p>
<p>
Marxism
has always taken the position that there is no final crisis of
capitalism as such. The myth evolved in the bourgeois press that
Marxism put forward the idea of capitalism collapsing of itself is of
course completely false. The failure of the working class to take
advantage of the crisis of capitalism following the Second World War
and overthrow capitalism as a result of the policy of the Labour and
Stalinist leaders in Western Europe gave to the ruling class, in
particular of Europe and the United States, the possibility of
attempting to find some way out of the impasse of capitalism at that
time.
</p>
<p>
Before
the war the crisis of capitalism had been expressed in the attempt of
each national capitalism to try and solve the problems at each
other&rsquo;s expense. In an atmosphere of exacerbated nationalism, each
capitalist class piled up tariff barriers and other means of keeping
out their competitors, while accumulating arms for the purpose of
settling once and for all the issue of who was to dominate the world.
</p>
<p>
The
crisis of capitalism was expressed in the inability of the
capitalists to eliminate the contradiction between the development of
productive forces beyond the limits imposed by the nation state and
the private ownership of the means of production. The capitalists
proved incapable of developing the productive forces which stagnated.
The ruling class tried to solve this problem by taking to the road of
world war.
</p>
<p>
Now
following the Second World War, with the world domination of American
imperialism and with the mighty productive power of American
capitalism in comparison to the enfeebled capitalism of Western
Europe and Japan, the Americans were able to impose the dollar
exchange standard rather than the system that had been in existence
in the past of linking world trade to gold.
</p>
<p>
Because
of the enormous and overwhelming military and economic power of
American imperialism they were able to impose their policies on the
entire capitalist world. These policies demanded a lowering of tariff
and other barriers to American goods. Therefore, through GATT and
other means, the capitalists were able to extend the world market.
The expansion of the world division of labour meant an enormous
development of production to an unparalleled extent.
</p>
<p>
Linked
to this was the policy of the British, American and other capitalists
of using Keynesian methods of deficit financing in order to expand
the markets of the different capitalist classes. Keynesian methods,
coupled with the expansion of the world market, had as its
consequence an enormous development of production on a scale that has
been unexampled in the whole history of capitalism. In a distorted
way this is an indication of what will be achieved under a
democratically planned socialist society in the future.
</p>
<p>
By
these means the capitalists partially overcame the limits imposed on
capitalism by the national state and the private ownership of the
means of production. The attempts to overcome the limits of
capitalism by these means, in this sense transcending these limits
for a whole historical period, had as a consequence an explosion of
inflation internationally and especially in Britain. This was because
British capitalism was the progenitor of these problems through its
acceptance of the theories of John Maynard Keynes.
</p>
<p>
All
the countries of capitalism are faced with an explosion of prices
such as has seldom been seen in the history of capitalism, at least
on a world scale.
</p>
<p>
When
these policies were beginning to flag, without having had very
favourable results in Britain, the ruling class tried the method of
devaluation. Their intention was to increase their share of the world
market. But they signally failed to achieve these results, among
other reasons because of the highly monopolised character of the
economy in Britain. Incidentally, the monopolisation of production
and distribution is one of the causes of inflation. The monopolies
are taking a greater share of the market than they are strictly
entitled to by their share of production.
</p>
<p>
But
devaluation is necessarily inflationary. It results in the rise of
the prices of imported raw materials and food and imported
manufactured goods. This fuelled the inflation in Britain and in
return provoked new devaluations. Devaluation is like a drug which
has to be taken in constantly increasing doses to have any effect.
Allowing the pound to fall on the exchange markets was intended to
give a lift to exports.
</p>
<p>
This
did not succeed even temporarily because in reality the 50 firms
which dominate 80 percent of exports merely raised the prices of
their goods making thousands of millions of pounds, in Heath&rsquo;s word
&ldquo;at a stroke&rdquo;, by raising prices to the level of the devaluation,
as well as completely scotching any question of increasing Britain&rsquo;s
share of the world market. In addition, budget deficits by their very
nature, led inevitably to the explosion of inflation in Britain and
world-wide.
</p>
<p>
Keynesianism
explained the difficulties that the capitalist system experienced by
the lack of &ldquo;demand&rdquo;. And it showed the contradiction between
unemployed workers on the one hand and unemployed resources of
factories and machinery on the other. State spending was intended to
give a boost to production, creating a demand by employing workers to
create a demand and by providing a market for goods. But this, as the
Marxists had explained, inevitably led to a rise in prices.
</p>
<p>
It
is the essence of capitalist crisis that there is an overproduction
simultaneously of capital and consumer goods for the purpose of
capitalist production i.e. for the purpose of producing profit.
</p>
<p>
The
use of budget deficits results in the expansion of paper money in the
form of currency and treasury notes. The consequence of putting two
pieces of paper where only one was necessary results, in that
particular instance, in doubling inflation.
</p>
<p>
The
strategists of capital in industry, in the media, and in the state
machine itself wishing to avoid the social impasse of pre-war
society, swallowed the illusions of the economist witch doctors. That
did not solve the problem. They had forgotten that Roosevelt in
&ldquo;pump-priming&rdquo; the economy failed completely, and did not prevent
the slump of 1937-38 following that of 1929-33.
</p>
<h4>Finance
versus industrial capital</h4>
<p class="fst">
In
addition to all the difficulties of British capitalism there is a
contradiction which is much sharper in Britain than in other
countries between finance capital on the one side and industrial
capital on the other.
</p>
<p>
These
contradictions have aggravated the problems of capitalism and
assisted in the decay and decline of Britain. In addition, in the
early fifties and sixties the policies of the right-wing trade union
leaders of trying to restrict increases in the wages of the workers
meant that there was no incentive on the part of the capitalist class
to invest even when interest rates were only 2.5 percent and British
capitalism was riding high on world markets.
</p>
<p>
In
1950, for example, they had 25 percent of world markets at that
period and 80 percent of new investment in industry was financed by
profits and not by borrowing from the banks.
</p>
<p>
Had
the trade union and Labour leaders adopted a policy of exerting
pressure on the capitalist class to gain higher wages and better
conditions, this would have compelled the capitalists to overcome
higher wages by investing in new machinery to increase the
productivity of labour with a view to eliminating workers in
proportion.
</p>
<p>
Instead
of this, they had the policy of nationalising ruined industries which
merely acted as the milch-cows of the private sector, providing the
monopolies with cheap coal, steel, electricity, gas and transport.
This, in turn, was a further disincentive for the capitalists to
invest in re-tooling and re-equipping industry in order to offset the
effects of high-priced raw materials.
</p>
<p>
At
that time, when interest rates in Britain were 2.5 percent and the
property boom and property speculation in factories and building had
not reached the heights of the seventies, such a development would
have been possible if the British capitalists had not been
featherbedded by the policy of the trade union and Labour leaders. It
would have been possible for British investment to be increased at
the same rate as their rivals abroad.
</p>
<p>
Now
the opportunity is gone, and capitalism is faced with a crisis which
is caused by its policies and the contradictions especially of
British capitalism between rent, interest and industrial profit.
These contradictions can only be solved at the expense of the working
class.
</p>
<p>
As
Keith Joseph pointed out in Washington, the working class in Britain
now has the lowest wages of any industrial country in the world. In
fact they have become the cheap labour of Western Europe. Even these
low wages are, however, not sufficiently low for the capitalists. The
crisis with which they are faced means that they will try to drive
real wages down to even lower levels.
</p>
<p>
The
policies of Keynesianism had its disastrous effect throughout the
world and provoked an absolute catastrophe for British capitalism.
Apart from Italy, inflation in Britain in the last period has been at
a higher rate than any of the main industrial countries (although now
America, too, has reached a very high level of inflation). The
policies of Keynesianism resulted in an explosion of inflation
internationally and especially in Britain.
</p>
<p>
All
the measures taken by the ruling class to ensure an economic upswing
as a precondition for the continued growth of the economy has
resulted in the opposite of what was desired: insecurity,
uncertainty, enfeeblement, and in the capitalists&rsquo; own terminology,
&ldquo;lack of confidence&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
It
is true that capitalism on an international scale faces the same
problems. But that is no consolation to the ruling class of Britain,
but merely aggravates the problems of British capitalism and of
British inflation.
</p>
<p>
Keynesianism
is bankrupt. Callaghan explained this in a brutally crude fashion at
the Labour Party conference in 1976 when he declared to the
conference in answer to arguments of the left, &ldquo;Keynesianism is
dead.&rdquo; The bankruptcy of Keynesianism is best expressed in the fact
that, for the first time in history, a new economic phenomenon has
been observed, that of stagflation, that is to say, simultaneously,
recession or small slump on the one hand, and the continuation of
inflation at a slower or sometimes even higher pace on the other.
</p>
<p>
This
nightmare has induced the major capitalist powers, meeting at Venice
recently in July to decide against any measures of reflation on their
part. On the contrary, they opted in favour of the continuation of
the methods of deflation&mdash;cuts in public expenditure, cuts in social
services, cuts in the expenditure of the state.
</p>
<p>
There
has been a precipitate abandonment of the method of budget deficits
as a solution of the problems facing capitalism. It is clear to
everybody that, far from being a solution, this method of creating
&ldquo;demand&rdquo; is an absolute disaster, an absolute catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
The
Marxists had already pointed this out in the early years of the
economic upswing at the end of the fifties and in the sixties.
Despite the worst post-war economic recession that is developing at
the present time the major capitalist powers are not prepared to take
up the new-fangled methods of Keynesianism but are falling back on
the old &ldquo;tried and trusted&rdquo; methods of deflation.
</p>
<p>
This
method is now in modern terms called monetarism, but in actual fact
the method was used in the 19<sup>th</sup>
century and early 20<sup>th</sup>
century and the period between the wars. The most crude and hard-line
advocates of monetarist policies have been the Thatcher-Howe-Joseph
clique of the Tory government.
</p>
<p>
In
a recent speech, Thatcher made a correct analysis (for once) when she
said, &ldquo;We [i.e. the strategists of capital&mdash;EG] have tried
everything and have failed, therefore we must turn to old tested and
tried remedies.&rdquo; In other words, turning to classical policies of
deflation, or putting the burden on the masses by slashing state
expenditure, by slashing real wages, by slashing the social wage, the
social services and so on, putting the burdens on the old, the sick,
the children and the working class.
</p>
<p>
It
is true that the method of Keynesianism has been an absolute
catastrophe for British capitalism. It has aggravated the problems of
capitalism and assisted in the decay and decline of industry. There
have been slashing cuts in the social services, health, transport,
and all the other things that make for a civilised existence for the
working class and the masses of the population. Not satisfied with
this situation, and the fact that the working class have now become
the lowest paid of Western Europe, the capitalists have launched a
savage attempt to cut down the real wages of the working class,
holding down wage increases far below the official rate of inflation.
And that is without taking into account the taxes which have also to
be added to gauge the extent of the cut in real wages.
</p>
<p>
The
Thatcher government&rsquo;s measures have resulted in an increase of
interest rates to record levels. This, in turn, with oil revenue from
the North Sea beginning to flow into the economy, has resulted in an
artificially strong pound.
</p>
<p>
Despite
the bonanza that they have reaped from this, there are grave
misgivings in the City of London. As the representatives of finance
capital, they traditionally have supported a &ldquo;strong pound&rdquo;. But
now the strong pound has resulted in a 40 percent disadvantage for
exports and a comparable advantage for foreign imports.
</p>
<p>
This
has been an absolute disaster for British industry. In the last
analysis, the City of London realised that this causes serious
problems and ultimately undermines their position also. Thus, neither
a strong pound nor a weak pound have solved the problems of British
capitalism.
</p>
<p>
Thatcher&rsquo;s
turn to the &ldquo;old, tried and tested remedies&rdquo; of capitalism has
piled disaster upon disaster. These reckless measures, taken at a
time of economic slump serve to deepen and intensify the effects of
the world recession in Britain. Moreover, Britain has, in reality,
had a period of recession which has lasted ten years. The boom which
followed the slump of 1975 was very weak, almost non-existent, as a
result of the measures of both Labour and Conservative governments.
</p>
<p>
Thus,
the measures of deflation taken at the same time as the exchange
level of the pound was raised through the increase in interest rates,
and the attempt to cut the deficit in public spending has further
affected the competitiveness of an already enfeebled industry in a
context of a general fall in industrial production. Even the big 50
companies which control 80 percent of exports have been affected.
</p>
<p>
British
competitiveness on the world market had already been affected by the
world slump. The loss of competitiveness over the 18 months to two
years has been about 40 percent, and possibly even 50 percent. This
is due to the rising value of the pound plus the squeeze on borrowing
by companies on interest rates of 20-22 percent and more. British
industry, which based itself on cheap wages as the only way to
maintain its positions on world markets and failed to invest in new
machinery for the purpose of competing with its rivals, is further
enfeebled by these measures of the Thatcher government.
</p>
<p>
With
a squeeze on profits, due again to a new property boom, and a rise in
interest rates, there has been an enormous reduction of the capacity
of even the monopolies which compete in foreign markets. The only way
British capitalism can hope to compete would have been by investing
in new machinery for the purposes of increasing productivity and
shedding labour by that means.
</p>
<p>
But
the funds to carry this out are so enormous, particularly on a
falling market, that only a small section of the capitalists have
been prepared to take this road, and therefore the measures of this
Thatcher government, far from restoring health to British capitalism,
will have even more disastrous consequences than the profligacy of
Keynesianism in the past.
</p>
<p>
The
grain of truth in monetarist theories which are mainly a repetition
of vulgar classical capitalist economics and the &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo;
theories of the vulgar economic witch-doctors of the 19<sup>th</sup>
century and the inter-war years is the idea that the printing of
extra paper money in the form of currency and Treasury notes causes
inflation, and that the root of the problem is the money supply.
</p>
<p>
But
having tried everything, a return to these methods and their results
have shown that the &ldquo;cure&rdquo; is even worse than the disease. In the
inter-war years one of the main reasons for the slumps was the
attempt to impose &ldquo;sound finance&rdquo; in Germany, in Britain, in
France, in the United States and in the other main capitalist
countries.
</p>
<p>
In
the 19<sup>th</sup> century,
too, the result of orthodox economic measures were not that dazzling
as they resulted in periodic slumps and periodic crises. Thus
weakened capitalism in Britain is faced with high interest rates and
lack of markets through the cutting of demand by the &ldquo;consumers&rdquo;
and the state, for capital and consumer goods, [and] a lack of
competitivity abroad.
</p>
<p>
Further
falls in the rates of investment (which have been explained in the
previous section) in their turn increased the crisis by creating
millions of unemployed and cutting the market even further.
Bankruptcies of small, medium-sized and even large concerns will not
result in a new blossoming of capitalism but only increase its
crisis.
</p>
<p>
The
irony is that the millions of unemployed and the large number of
bankruptcies which have been caused by the policy of the Thatcher
government means a fall in taxes collected and an increase in the
amount spent on dole and supplementary assistance. Inevitably as the
crisis deepens and demands for subsidies by industry will increase,
it means that the attempt to cut the budget deficit will not succeed
and that their policies will reduce the economy to a worse state than
it was in before, with the additional problem of inflation.
</p>
<p>
It
is true that the cutting of the market on the one hand, and the lack
of competitiveness on foreign markets on the other hand will exert
their pressure on prices and therefore, in a situation in which
international markets are more open to competition than in the period
before the war or in the 19<sup>th</sup>
century as a consequence of the cuts in tariff and other barriers,
there will be some reduction in inflation.
</p>
<h4>Neither
monetarism nor Keynesianism</h4>
<p class="fst">
More
accurately, not a fall in inflation but a fall in the rate of
increase of prices, which is a different thing entirely. The
horrifying figure of 20 percent and more inflation can drop in the
next period to perhaps 15-16 percent and then hover a little above or
below 10 percent before threatening to take off as it has in the
past.
</p>
<p>
Capitalism
is in a vicious circle. If they carry through these measures they can
only attenuate inflation to a limited extent. For instance, the
strategists of American capital, the US economists&mdash;witch-doctor
economists&mdash;themselves recognise that for the rest of this decade,
inflation in America will hover around the figure of 10 percent. In
addition, the capitalist governments in Britain and in other
countries will zigzag, and Thatcher will undoubtedly be compelled to
reverse her policy, under the pressure of the CBI and even the
finance capitalists of the City of London.
</p>
<p>
Moving
in a zigzag fashion, alternating between measures of reflation and
deflation, and trying to combine the two, as with the policies of
Denis Healey and the Labour government of 1974-79 they will only
exacerbate the crisis.
</p>
<p>
What
the strategists of capital and the capitalist politicians of all
countries have all been compelled to accept is that they are now in a
crisis of the system very similar to the crisis in the thirties.
Marxism in the past rejected the arguments of the Keynesians,
predicting the consequences that this policy would have.
</p>
<p>
In
the same way Marxism rejects the arguments of the monetarists which
can only prepare even greater disasters. The capitalists are torn
between the horns of a dilemma. Keynesianism will result in
inflation, and monetarism will result in exacerbating the slump. Even
when, as is inevitable, the capitalists climb out of the present
world recession during the course of or at the end of 1981, this will
not solve the problems. The economic boom which will follow the
present slump will not solve the problems. The economic boom which
will follow the present slump will be of a very short duration
preparing in turn a new collapse of the productive forces.
</p>
<p>
On
the lines of Keynesianism there is no solution. On the lines of
monetarism there is an even more disastrous outcome for capitalism.
Marxism has to explain to the advanced layers of the working class
and to the mass of the working class as a whole, as events themselves
will be demonstrating, that on the road of capitalism there is no way
out.
</p>
<p>
Marxism
must retort to the Thatcherites and to the monetarism of Denis Healey
and the right wing of the Labour Party: the crisis is the crisis of
your system, the crisis of the capitalist system.
</p>
<p>
For
example, the Tories argue that the &pound;11,000 million deficit in public
expenditure (which the Thatcherites have claimed) is the cause of
inflation. This could easily be plugged by a cancellation of the
national debt which amounts to &pound;11,000 million a year in interest,
as a result of the increase in the interest rates which were the
consequence of the policies of the monetarists. The national debt is
the payment for the blood and suffering of the masses in the last
four major wars fought by British capitalism including the Boer War
and the Crimean War.
</p>
<p>
At
the same time, we must explain that if there would be an increase of
two or three percent in production&mdash;which is a very modest
figure&mdash;the &pound;11,000 million budgetary deficit would vanish because
of the increased revenue of the government which they would gain
through the taxes that they impose.
</p>
<p>
They
abandoned the policy of trying to get high growth at the expense of
inflation because of the contradictions which this would entail. The
policies of deflation, the policies of the squeeze, have cut
production. And that is the madness of the capitalist system.
</p>
<p>
Even
in the boom, only 80 percent of output capacity was used. Another 20
percent production of wealth would easily have solved the problem of
inflation, if it was not for the contradictions of capitalism which
we have explained&mdash;the major contradiction being that the capitalist
system is not one for the production of goods that are needed by the
population, but a system of production for profit for the monopolies,
for big business and for the banking interests.
</p>
<p>
With
the measures taken by the Tory government a further decline of
British capitalism is inevitable. The dream of restoring the health
of British capitalism by returning to the policies of the 19<sup>th</sup>
century is a reflection of the insanity of the strategists of capital
caused by the blind alley in which capitalism finds itself at the
present time.
</p>
<p>
The
glories of British capitalism of the 19<sup>th</sup>
century and of the early 20<sup>th</sup>
century are now a thing of the past. That slow and inglorious decline
of which Trotsky spoke in his material on Britain in the twenties and
thirties has now turned into a headlong decline in the power,
influence and capacity of British capitalism and of British industry.
</p>
<p>
On
this road there is no way out. What the monetarists are doing is like
a quack surgeon who believes that he can ensure the health of his
patient who is suffering from an ailing heart by cutting off an arm
and a leg in order to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; the illnesses of the patient.
</p>
<p>
Inflation
will drop somewhat because of the fall in the price of raw materials
and food stocks on world markets as the recession deepens and the
almost doubling of VAT is absorbed into the index figures but in the
long term inflation will fluctuate, even in the best of cases, around
10 percent. This year will probably end with inflation at least 16
percent or even possibly higher.
</p>
<p>
Due
to international competition it will not be possible for the big
monopolies to raise their prices at the same pace as they have done
in the past. The fall in the purchasing power of the masses is also a
factor which will depress prices to some extent. But the consequence
will be 2 to 3 million unemployed with inflation still hovering
around 10 percent or more, with the possibility at the moment that
when the crisis, recession or small slump ends, there will be a
further increase in inflation.
</p>
<p>
The
increased expenditure on arms has been one of the major factors in
the last two or three decades in increasing inflation. The production
of arms means the production of fictitious capital instead of real
goods in the form of capital goods or consumer goods, and as a
consequence is a major factor in the development of world inflation.
</p>
<p>
Depressing
the real wages of the working class will also have the effect of
depressing the market. This is shown by the measures of the
Callaghan-Healey government between 1974 and 1979. One of the reasons
why investment did not pick up to a great extent was the slashing of
state expenditure by &pound;8,000 million in 1976-1977 and the cutting of
the real wages of the working class through incomes policies.
</p>
<p>
Therefore
the capitalists were caught up in the further contradictions of their
social system. Thatcherism is raw, unadulterated monetarism&mdash;savage
cuts in state expenditure and attempts to depress the real wages of
the working class which, in its turn, will succeed in exacerbating
the class struggle and produce explosions.
</p>
<p>
With
the sickness of British capitalism measures of massive deflation can
only have disastrous consequences. Neither inflation nor deflation
can solve the problems of the working class, but on the contrary
exacerbate the decline of living standards and of the social wage.
</p>
<p>
The
policy of Marxism has to be: neither inflation nor deflation, but
socialist policies. The collapse of part of British industry will
make Britain even more dependent on imports from abroad. The crazy
desire to cut down the industrial capacity of the steel, shipbuilding
and other industries means that when the market swings forward, as it
inevitably will, then, as has happened on a number of occasions
during the course of the last decade, British capitalism will not
have the capacity to fill these markets and therefore the gaps will
be filled by further imports of steel and of other goods.
</p>
<h4>Labour right
wing have no answers</h4>
<p class="fst">
Under
the present conditions it will therefore be very difficult for
British capitalism to recover lost ground. The policies of
Thatcherite monetarism are a policy of open class war, putting the
burdens of the crisis of capitalism on the shoulders of the working
class, which will inevitably provoke resistance by the working class
over the next period.
</p>
<p>
On
the other hand the policies of the right-wing leaders of the Labour
Party and of the trade union movement are merely a diluted version of
the policies of Thatcherism&mdash;policies of mixed monetarism and
Keynesianism. They would have even worse consequences as far as the
economy is concerned. As against the open attempt of Thatcher to hold
down the wages of the working class, their policy of prices and
incomes policy&mdash;in reality a policy of holding down wages below the
level of inflation through incomes policy as was evidenced in
1974-79&mdash;will not satisfy the workers when they see the disastrous
consequences which it will have on their standards of living.
</p>
<p>
The
right-wing reformists have abandoned the programme of reforms
precisely because they wish to preserve the present status quo
industrially and socially. Consequently, they do not favour further
large scale nationalisation.
</p>
<p>
They
began the savage cuts in state expenditure in 1976-79. The real
standard of living was reduced as a result of incomes policies by
over 9 percent in 1974-1979, the period of the right wing Labour
government.
</p>
<p>
Consequently,
under conditions of capitalist crisis the policy of
Healey-Rodgers-Williams and of Callaghan would develop on the same
lines as that of 1974-79.
</p>
<p>
The
solution to the crisis put forward by the capitalists and thus also
by the reformists is to forego even the promise of reforms. From
reformism of the past to the policy of counter-reformism. On the
other hand the so-called alternative policy of the NEC and the Labour
and trade union left is that of using the discredited methods of
Keynesianism.
</p>
<p>
This
would result in an explosion of inflation. This would particularly be
the case taking into consideration the high rate of inflation that
already exists. Clearly this policy would be untenable. The pressure
of big business, the pressure of the City of London, would force a
U-turn on the Labour government in the same way as it is going to
force a U-turn on the Tory government.
</p>
<p>
Even
a left Labour government would not be able to carry out the programme
which they put forward of piecemeal reform of capitalism. A policy of
&ldquo;little-by-little&rdquo; changes means having to live with the
consequences of trying to work within the framework of capitalism. It
means that they too will be forced to embark on a policy of
abandoning their promised reforms and carrying out a programme of
counter-reforms.
</p>
<p>
At
best, if they attempt to carry out their programme it would result in
an explosion of inflation of Latin American levels, as occurred with
the Allende government in Chile in the three years in which the
coalition government held power.
</p>
<p>
The
history of the post-war decades has been living proof of the
correctness of the ideas of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky. On the road of
reform of capitalism there can only be disaster. Moving on the basis
of the gradual or slow reform of the economy can only prepare the way
after a period of small recessions and booms for a collapse on the
lines of that of 1929-33.
</p>
<p>
With
this policy of gradual and slow change of the economy the German
social-democrats prepared the way for Hitler in 1933. While there is
no question of fascism in the period that lies ahead, the crisis of
capitalism will assume such proportions as the ruling class in a
desperate endeavour to save themselves, will have recourse to
military coups and even to the road of civil war against the working
class even in countries such as Britain.
</p>
<p>
The
fact that the Tories have been compelled, despite the experience of
1970 to 1974, once again to limit the rights of the trade unions&mdash;and
to limit the rights of organised workers to conduct a peaceful
struggle to defend their interests, to defend themselves against
victimisation, to defend their organisations, to defend their living
standards, limiting the right to picket and the closed shop&mdash;shows
the crisis of the society&mdash;and these are merely the first efforts on
the part of the Tories.
</p>
<p>
If
they should succeed in getting away with these measures, new measures
would undoubtedly be introduced as Prior has explained. Prior,
Gilmour and the other so-called &ldquo;wets&rdquo; represent the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo;
wing of the Tories. In reality their policy is fundamentally no
different from that of Thatcher. It is a question merely of not
crudely trying to pile on all the measures at once, but to attack the
workers piecemeal. If they succeed in imposing one section of their
programme then the others would follow rapidly.
</p>
<p>
There
is no way out for the working class or the labour movement on this
basis. Even if the left reformists came to power and tried to carry
out sections of the programme piecemeal, a little at a time, it would
cause an explosion of inflation as in Chile under Allende. The ruling
class would try to provoke panic and attempt to swing the middle
class, small shop keepers, professional people, small businessmen and
even politically backward sections of the working class against such
a government.
</p>
<p>
The
Marxists will continue to put forward demands for massive increases
in public works, useful state expenditure, housing, transport,
health, education and other social services. We must demand work for
full wages (work or full maintenance) for the unemployed. We must
fight against the attempt to turn the clock back to the workhouse
methods of the Josephs, Thatchers and liberal Tories like Prior. The
suggestion of &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; unpaid work for the unemployed, put
forward by Prior, was a trial balloon for such methods.
</p>
<h4>A socialist
plan of production</h4>
<p class="fst">
Already
in Guernsey this &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; work of the unemployed, at rates &pound;2
or &pound;3 higher than what the unemployed get but far below the trade
union rates for similar types of work on the mainland, is an example
which is enthusiastically quoted by the yellow press for Britain to
follow. The fact that they go back to methods of this sort in
conditions of crisis is an extreme expression of the complete
bankruptcy of capitalism.
</p>
<p>
These
demands for a massive increase in expenditure on public works, with
wages at full trade union rates and a minimum wage, sliding scale of
hours and wages to absorb the unemployed and keep up with the cost of
living automatically, similar to the <i>Scala
Mobile</i> in Italy but with the trade unions
determining the index, must be linked, clearly and indisputably, with
the need to transform society and introduce a genuine plan of
production.
</p>
<p>
Without
a plan of production, undoubtedly, all these measures would fuel
inflation. It would take all the resources of society, manpower,
science, technique and production to produce goods to the maximum
capacity of the economy.
</p>
<p>
A
monopoly of foreign trade coupled with the nationalisation of the
monopolies, banks, insurance companies (50 of whom control 80 percent
of exports) with compensation on the basis of need only, and workers&rsquo;
control and management of industry, and of the state is the only
means of supplying the economic basis for using output to the maximum
of its capacity, utilising science, industry and all the other
capacities for production to the maximum extent.
</p>
<p>
This
programme is the only means of taking over society in the interests
of the masses. It would include the abolition of the House of Lords
and the Monarchy as an indispensable measure to prevent the ruling
class from resisting these demands.
</p>
<p>
At
the same time we demand the nationalisation of the press under the
control of the trade unions and the workers&rsquo; cultural
organisations. Every tendency in society, according to the vote that
they get, will have access to the press, to the radio and the TV.
This will be a far more democratic system than we have got at the
present time.
</p>
<p>
These
transitional demands must be put in the context of struggle. Without
the transformation of society it is not possible to carry through the
&ldquo;alternative&rdquo; programme put forward by the Tribunites. This
programme would make completely unnecessary the question of
&ldquo;selective import controls&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
On
a capitalist basis selective import controls could only result in
retaliation and trade wars with other capitalist powers which would
further exacerbate the crisis of capitalism that already exists as
similar measures exacerbated the crisis in the twenties and thirties.
</p>
<p>
The
road of capitalism offers no way out but a long death agony. British
capitalism in particular is the sick man of Western Europe. There is
no cure for capitalism. The convulsions of deflation and inflation
mark the sickness of the capitalist society. Outside of the drastic
surgery of the socialist revolution there is no solution.
</p>
<h4>No future under capitalism</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
economic witch-doctors of capitalism can argue for their quack
potions of Keynesianism or Friedmanism. We must convince the labour
and trade union movement that we must break with all capitalist
policies of this sort. On this road there is no answer. The only
&ldquo;democratic socialist&rdquo; solution to the economic impasse of
capitalism lies in its overthrow.
</p>
<p>
The
period of economic upswing of world capitalism for the quarter of a
century from 1950 to 1975 is definitively at an end. The decade of
the eighties will be similar to the decade of the thirties. The
latter began with a world economic depression with convulsive ups and
downs and ended in a new tendency to deep slump which was only
overcome by the catastrophe of the Second World War.
</p>
<p>
The
decade of the 1980s begins with the deepest post-World War Two slump.
It marks a new period, characterised by a rapidly alternating cycle
of decline and recovery of the economy, with two to six years in each
cycle. Thus the decade of the eighties could even possibly end with a
new economic depression to rival that of the thirties.
</p>
<p>
What
is certain is that slump and recession, each time deeper or at the
same level, as shown by recent slumps, will alternate in rapid
succession. Capitalism cannot develop the productive forces created
by the labour of the working class.
</p>
<p>
Periods
of this type mark the change from one social system to another,
within the cage of capitalism the workers&rsquo; organisations will lay
out the map for the new social system.
</p>
<p>
Capitalism,
even in its period of decay and rot, will not collapse of itself. It
falls to the lot of the living forces of the new social order, i.e.
the workers through their own organisations, to overthrow it.
</p>
<p>
The
task of illuminating and leading the struggle stands on the shoulders
of the Marxists. Only they can explain to the working class through
its organisations the impasse of the social system and the need to
take control into their hands.
</p>
<p>
The
socialist transformation of society is the only means to guarantee a
civilised existence and carry society forward on the basis of the
maximum use of the resources created by the labour of the working
class.
</p>
<p>
By
utilising the full economic, scientific and technical potential of
the economy, with the enthusiastic creative efforts of the working
class, in a society where unemployment, want and hunger are abolished
and access to all necessities are guaranteed, the free democratic
control of industry and of the state by the working class will ensure
a higher development of society on a more civilised and enlightened
basis.
</p>
<p>
A
free democratic society under the control and management of the
working class could carry through the new microchip transformation of
industry, which would clear the way for the complete transition to
socialism.
</p>
<p>
The
microchip and the capitalist system are in complete contradiction.
This can never be solved by the capitalists and their obedient
servants in the field of science, but only by the organised and
politically conscious working class.
</p>
<p>
A
substantial minimum wage for a thirty-five hour week will very
rapidly be followed by bringing the working class to a six-hour,
four-day week on the basis of micro-technology and science, using
these techniques to re-equip industry, using the skill of the
technique, very rapidly we can pass from a six-hour day, four-day
week to a two-hour day, two-day week, and even a one-day week in the
future, as mankind, beginning with a socialist Britain and Europe,
moves in the direction of socialism.
