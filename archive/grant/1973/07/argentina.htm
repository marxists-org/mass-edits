<p>With the collapse of the military police dictatorship and the
coming to power of Peron/Campora, Argentina has become a key
country in Latin America, even the world.</p>

<p>In a certain sense it reflects a similar process to that in
Spain when the dictatorship of Primo Rivera and the monarchy fell
and there was the proclamation of the &quot;democratic
republic&quot;. This opened the period of social revolution in
Spain, which after a turbulent period ended in the Fascist
insurrection of Franco and civil war.</p>

<p>Argentina has now entered a period of turmoil, whose issue will
partly be determined by the understanding of the situation and the
policy, strategy and tactics of Marxists in Argentina.</p>

<p>The Peronists gained almost 50% of the votes in an election,
reluctantly conceded by the military police dictatorship. The
overwhelming majority of the workers, especially the young workers,
voted for Campora as President and for the Peronist slate.</p>

<p>How does it happen that the former Bonapartist dictator should
have such magic to his name, (or in the vulgar vernacular,
charisma) in contrast with the clique of armed service dictators?
The secret is supplied by the history of Peronism and the history
of Argentina. (Bonapartism is a state where the &quot;strong
man&quot; while representing the ruling class does so by
pretending to stand &quot;above society&quot; and balancing
between the antagonistic classes of workers and capitalists. It is
&quot;rule by the sword&quot; (Marx) or a military-police state
of a special type).</p>

<p>Since the world slump of the Thirties, Argentina has, in the
main, had a succession of military governments. Peron was a
supporter of the coup of the extremely reactionary General Uriburi
on September 4th 1930, who found inspiration in the example of
Fascist Italy.</p>

<p>He was associated with the coup of the generals in 1943. He was
appointed Minister of the Department of Labour and Social Welfare.
He very cleverly utilised this to build up his personal power and
following. The very next day after his appointment a batch of trade
union and Labour leaders were arrested. He had his own supporters
take over the leadership of the unions. He declared he was the
friend of labour and promised higher wages, better working
conditions and social security.</p>


<h4>Demagogy</h4>

<p>He energetically set into motion the organisation of the
unorganised workers. From 200,000 workers organised into trade
unions, under Peron's patronage <em>five million</em>, or the
overwhelming majority, became organized.</p>

<p>Strikes had been forcibly suppressed and the peasants and farm
workers had no rights, not even the right to vote in elections.
Struggle on the farms was met with machine guns. Peron gave them
rights.</p>

<p>Peron was enabled to engage in this social demagogy, and partly
carry it out, because Argentina was in a favourable position
because of the 2nd World War and the enormous demand and market for
meat, wheat and other farm products produced in Argentina. High
prices during the war and especially in the post war period were
obtained.</p>

<p>On this basis, for a temporary period, it was possible to grant
important reforms. Leaning on the support of &quot;labour and the
army&quot; Peron could &quot;strike blows&quot; against the
hated foreign imperialists, especially the
&quot;Yankees&quot;.</p>

<p>But he denounced &quot;the false apostles who had gotten into
the unions to trick the workers and betray the workers or to lead
them into agitations in the field of international politics and
ideologies&quot;. He declared, &quot;with the creation of the
secretariat of Labour and Social Welfare (Prevision) we have
initiated the era of Argentine Social Politics. The epoch of
instability and disorder in which were submerged the relations
between employers and workers is behind us forever... Private
enterprises will be guaranteed that if they pay the wages and
follow the healthy rules of human welfare, the state will recognise
their efforts on behalf of the general economy...&quot;</p>

<p>The policy of the Department was &quot;the highest principles
of social collaboration... Fomenting new private
capital...&quot;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for a period, Peron instituted radical reforms: an
overall wage increase, a month's pay as a Christmas bonus,
8-hour day, minimum wage, holidays with pay and accident Insurance;
the farm workers, too, received an 8-hour day, rest periods,
minimum food requirements, minimum wage, holidays with pay, decent
housing, schools, free medical care, the right to organise and all
civil rights.</p>


<h4>Re-Election</h4>

<p>On May 1, 1944, labour's traditional day of demonstrations
and renewal of faith in Socialism, Peron, usurping the day,
organised a huge rally. He declared again, demagogically
&quot;every day thousands of workers come to the Secretariat of
Labour and Social Welfare, workers of every branch of productive
activity, scores of delegations bring us their problems, their
hopes and aspirations. On this classic labour Day I promise that
this confidence will not be defrauded.&quot;</p>

<p>He declared the enemy to be the oligarchy &#8211; the landowner
and &quot;estanciero&quot; rancher interests and Yankee
Imperialism. &quot;Labour and the army&quot; were the forces
which were going to face up to these foes.</p>

<p>Later, he was removed by his co-officer dictators, but within a
few days he was restored to power by massive demonstrations.
Failure to face up to and explain Peronism as a Bonapartist
phenomenon resulted in a split in the CP and Socialist Party. The
Communist-controlled Labour Federation voluntarily dissolved and
joined the Peronist Federation - the same thing happened in
the unions controlled by the SP and youth members went over
&quot;in droves&quot; into the Peron camp.</p>

<p>In 1949, Peron was re-elected, but the economic climate was
changing and in 1953 Peron, abandoning his verbal stand against US
Imperialism, declared that Argentina needed the
&quot;collaboration of capitalist Imperialists or development
would have to be indefinitely postponed.&quot; He announced oil
concessions to the Standard Oil Company of California. A new law
was passed giving favourable terms to foreign investors. There were
strikes of protest by sections of the workers.</p>

<p>The army officers who hated Peron's social demagogy which
they considered was dangerous because of its effects on the
workers, took advantage of the economic difficulties and the
disillusionment with Peron to organize another coup and oust him
from power in 1955.</p>

<p>Peron, despite all his demagogy had taken no action to deprive
the landed oligarchy of its power by nationalizing the land. His
structures against Imperialism were not followed by deeds. He
over-compensated British capitalism when he bought the railways and
other vested interests; according to the experts the compensation
was &quot;generous&quot;, while Peron was shouting about
&quot;expropriation&quot;.</p>

<p>Peron leaned on the developing native industrial capitalists and
on the working class - but in reality reflected the
interests of the former. He assisted the development of industry at
the expense of the landed oligarchy by establishing a state
monopoly concern which bought the grain and meat and then sold it
at a higher price on the world market. There was an enormous amount
of graft and corruption. No agrarian revolution or real action
against Imperialism was undertaken. These forces combined with the
army caste to topple him from power.</p>

<p>But the economic crisis caused by the weakness of Argentine
capitalism, as still an underdeveloped country under the heel of
Imperialism and of landlordism and capitalism, undermined the power
of his successors. The conditions of the masses worsened. Hundreds
of thousands and millions were driven from the countryside and left
for the towns. Here they lived in terrible hunger and poverty.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, with a population of 7 million, has three million
living in the &quot;favelas&quot; on the outskirts. These are
&quot;suburbs&quot; with &quot;houses&quot; made out of
sacking, tin cans and other crude materials and are without water,
sewage, electric lights, street paving, schools or hospitals;
symbolically they only have police stations.</p>

<p>The economic situation, despite the increase in industry has
declined frightfully, 87% of exports are still agricultural
products. In 1962 there was a fall in cultivation on the Argentine
plains of 27%. Output per rural inhabitant declined by 40%. In 1940
wheat exports were 36% of world exports. In 1955 they were 15%.</p>

<p>Under Frondizi, the &quot;Radical&quot; president who followed
Peron after elections were held subsequent to his fall, the
consumption of eggs, meat, bread, milk and potatoes declined by a
third; many hospitals and schools were closed. Public works were
cut by 2000 million Pesos. Railroad charges increased 150%. 100,000
railroad workers were dismissed; electricity charges for consumers
were increased by 50%. This resulted in many bitter strikes.</p>

<p>Inflation subsequently reduced real wages by 50% while nominal
wages were not allowed to rise by more than 15%.</p>


<h4>Industry</h4>

<p>The industrial development of Argentina, which received a big
impetus in the two world wars is expressed in the production of
steel which reached one and a half million tons in 1970, with a
projected production of 5.5 million in 1975. 220,817 cars were
produced in 1970, 2000 train wagons and 300 electrical locos with
25% of the parts imported, subway coaches, chemicals, leather, 5
million tons of cement in 1970. The shipyards produce 40,000-ton
ships.</p>

<p>According to some authorities there are now 3,7 million trade
union members, who with their wives and families, constitute the
big majority of the population of Argentina. 360,000 people are
considered as unemployed, though the Favelas would indicate many
more.</p>

<p>The cost of living with inflation has been going up by leaps and
bounds. Inflation is officially 80% in the last year. Naturally
this has resulted in the comparison with the early years of
Peronist rule - and with the renewed social and
anti-imperialist demagogy of Peron, the masses have looked to
Peronist power to alleviate their distressed conditions.</p>

<p>One armed forces clique has replaced another in rapid
succession, while the standards and conditions of the masses have
deteriorated. From June 30, 1969 when there was an army coup there
have been a succession of &quot;states of siege&quot; proclaimed.
Throughout 1971 and 1972 there was a permanent state of siege.
Despite states of siege and states of emergency, there have been a
whole series of outbreaks in Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Tucuman and
other towns and provinces. A whole series of general strikes have
taken place. In some areas this resulted in virtual insurrection,
with barricade fighting in the streets.</p>

<p>Despite action against the headquarters of the Peronist unions,
this merely added to the anger of the workers. In the province of
Mendoza on April 4th 1972, a state of emergency was declared, after
a 24-hour general strike against increases in electricity charges.
In the subsequent demonstration, one was killed and 69 injured in
fighting with the police. 147 cars were burnt, 200 shop windows
broken. All demonstrations were banned on April 8th, but there was
a suspension of the increased electricity charges.</p>

<p>In June 1972 there was a 24-hour general strike in Tucuman.
Troops and tanks were called out to remove students and demolish
street barricades. On June 28th 1972 there were demonstrations in
Buenos Aires, Bahia Blanca. Tucuman, La Plata and Mendoza, which
were suppressed by troops and police combined.</p>

<p>Demonstrators seized the town hall and radio station at Malargue
on July 3rd. The army was compelled to take over. On July 9th in
the town of General Roca (Rio Negro province) the population
forcibly prevented an army parade. On 18 July, the town was put
under military control.</p>

<p>In one area there was fighting with &quot;special
formations&quot; of the Peronist Youth on December 3rd 1972. The
casualties were: 1 killed, 30 wounded, including 14 policemen.</p>

<p>These instances could be multiplied indefinitely. To describe
them all would be to take up the entire issue of the paper. But the
growing tide of revolution, which the generals' regime could
not dam up, was mounting higher and higher. In May 1971 in order to
conserve foreign exchange, slaughter of cattle for 2 weeks in the
month was forbidden except for export. This in a country where beef
was a staple and the domestic consumption was formerly 100 kilos
per head per annum. In August 1971 there was a complete ban on
domestic beef consumption. Inflation was steadily eating away the
standards of the people.</p>

<p>In 1959 it was 100%. In 1955 the rate of exchange was 18 pesos
to the $, by1967 it was 350. The introduction of the new peso did
not help. It went in a few months from 4 to 5 to the $ then 10 to
the $ etc.</p>

<p>The Peronist trade union federation warned on July 5th 1972,
under the dictatorship, that unless there was &quot;respect for
the will of the people, there would be violent
revolution.&quot;</p>

<p>Their bank account was blocked by the military rulers. On
September 14 1972, Senor Jose Rucci, the General Secretary of the
CGT (Trade Union Federation) in the name of the CGT announced an
economic and social plan, proposing nationalisation of banks,
insurance companies and foreign trade, land reform, limitation of
foreign enterprises and workers' participation in public and
private undertakings.</p>

<p>This radical programme was followed by 24-hour general strikes
in October 1972. The ferment in the country was indicated when 1/4
of the priests came out for a vaguely revolutionary programme. In
the general hatred and frustration of the regime, without the
influence of a strong Marxist organisation or tradition, and with
the example of Cuba and China, 5 guerrilla groups were formed.</p>

<p>They added to the general confusion by their activities. Without
any real perspectives, one even paraded as
&quot;Trotskyist&quot;, though such activities have nothing in
common with the Marxist idea that the &quot;emancipation of the
working class is the task of the workers themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>They showed great daring and achieved some spectacular exploits.
But the kidnapping of foreign businessmen for ransom, made them
rich groups, but did not, in reality, take the revolution one step
forward. They acted as philanthropic do-gooders, Robin Hoods of the
modern world, demanding food and blankets for distribution to the
poor. They &quot;acted for the workers&quot;, demanding
reinstatement of sacked workers and wage increases.</p>

<p>This in no way showed the workers their power, or helped them to
organise or direct this mighty potential strength. Thus, far from
developing the socialist consciousness of the workers, in so far as
they had any effect, they lowered it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless with the pressure of the workers and the general
discontent of the masses, the feeling of revolution in the air, the
Junta split. General Lanusse came to power and announced elections
to be held in March 1973. Still trying to cling to power, he
announced that the armed forces would insist on being represented
in any cabinet arising from the elections.</p>

<p>But in the aftermath of the elections, with the upsurge of the
masses, the Generals and Admirals were unable to maintain this.
They could not maintain either their prohibition of any general
amnesty for political prisoners.</p>


<h4>Helpless</h4>

<p>The jails were threatened with destruction by demonstrators
after the elections. Political prisoners were hastily released by
Campora, despite threats from the Generals, use of the police and
troops had led to one demonstrator being killed and an angry mood
was developing.</p>

<p>Campora legalised the Communist Party, who in a
&quot;Front&quot; had received an estimated 3% of the vote in the
election, and announced full freedom for all political tendencies.
The programme of the Peronists in the Frejuli, the Peronist front
which contested the election, indicates that they will be as
helpless as the Generals in dealing with Argentina's
problems. It rejected &quot;dogmatic international
socialism&quot; and put forward a &quot;national and Christian
people's socialism&quot; without any precise proposals on
such questions as nationalisation.</p>

<p>It projected the re-establishment of the Argentine Trade
Institute (IAPI) which under Peron had controlled all exports. It
would take over &quot;strategic industries&quot;, not specified,
and those which employ &quot;monopolistic power&quot;.</p>

<p>They promised a minimum wage linked to the cost of living. They
attacked Imperialism and denounced the &quot;Organisation of
American States&quot; as &quot;a beach-head for Imperialist
penetration.&quot;</p>

<p>On August 8th 1972, Peron had declared that Argentina needed a
&quot;great leader&quot; &#8212; i.e. himself &#8212; to
&quot;restore its historic role in the struggle for the second
independence of Latin America&quot;. He put forward a programme
including &quot;changes in economic and social policy including
the appointment of an economic cabinet composed of representatives
of both employers and employees; a clear definition of the role of
the military...&quot; he said &quot;that Peru was the nearest
model to be followed by Argentina, as Cuba and Chile were too far
to the left and Brazil too far to the right.&quot;</p>

<p>The Peronist &quot;Justicialist Liberation Front&quot; on
December 7 1972 adopted a programme which called for
&quot;guarantees for property and private initiative as far as
they fulfil a social function and an adequate monetary exchange
policy imposing norms for the participation of foreign capital,
credit and technology... Land... at the service of the man who
works on it and makes it productive, while avoiding excessive
concentration and fragmentation.&quot;</p>

<p>Hardly programmes to frighten the capitalists, landowners, and
their tools, the heads of the armed services. Programmes which will
not bring the Argentine revolution even one step forward. They will
not solve the problem of inflation, nor economic growth nor the
struggle against imperialism.</p>

<p>The middle course between socialism and capitalism never existed
and never will exist. Either a government reflects the interests of
the workers in which case it must expropriate the capitalists, or
it must reflect the interests of the capitalists and attack those
of the workers. In a period of economic crisis and inflation such
as effects Argentina, there is no room for fundamental changes on a
capitalist basis.</p>


<h4>Gestures</h4>

<p>True, in order to appease the workers, the Campora government
has decreed &quot;the nationalisation of various banks which have
been acquired wholly or partly by foreign investors in the past few
years.&quot; But gestures such as these and the verbal attacks on
imperialism, while reassuring them behind the scenes will not
pacify the masses for long.</p>

<p>The Financial Times of June 29 reports, &quot;Frightened
bankers and foreign businessmen have been reassured by the Central
Bank that the measures announced will not turn out to be as bad as
they look. 'We are not xenophobic nor dedicated to merely
destroying the system' Dr Alfred Gomez Morales, the president
of the Central bank remarked to me this week...He put forward
arguments why 'Argentina should still be an attractive place
for foreign investors'.&quot;</p>

<p>Three million turned out to welcome Peron's return to
Argentina. But it turned into a fiasco, as right-wing Peronist
gunmen, allegedly hired by union bureaucrats, attacked the left
wing Peronist Youth and the representatives of the Peronist
guerrillas. In this was indicated Peron's method of balancing
between class forces and the inevitable chasm which is opening up
between the two wings.</p>

<p>The left wing, especially the youth, want Socialism and drastic
reprisals against Imperialism, big business and the military
leaders. The right wing represents Argentine capitalism.</p>

<p>Peron's tightrope act of manoeuvring between these forces
and giving sops, first to one side and then the other, cannot work.
It is balancing over an uncontrollable fire. The rope will
inevitably burn up. The myth of Peronism will evaporate in the cold
light of reality.</p>

<p>The masses want their modest daily needs attended to. Instead
there will be a continuing deterioration. After a period of months,
perhaps weeks, there will be new demonstrations and strikes as the
masses see they are being fed only with empty promises.
Uncontrolled inflation continuing to worsen living standards will
continue on the basis of capitalism.</p>

<p>Peron and Campora have no magic wand to abolish it. Their
meaningless &quot;Christian socialism&quot; can give them no grip
on the real levers of economic power. &quot;Private
ownership&quot; means that the causes of inflation, now worldwide,
in capitalist countries, will continue their course and result in
further steep rises in Argentina.</p>

<p>Balancing right Peronists and left Peronists against each other
could work when concessions could be given to both on the basis of
riches created by the working class, and a favourable world market.
Higher prices for meat and wheat will be cancelled out by the still
higher prices of industrial capital and consumer goods imported by
Argentina.</p>

<p>There will be the impatience of the 300 families of the landed
aristocratic oligarchs and the irritation and pressure of the
Argentine capitalists. At the same time the workers have the
confidence that they were responsible for the surrender of the
armed forces' Junta. They are all looking to Peron, for the
moment, to carry out miracles. He cannot satisfy any of them.</p>

<h4>Revolution</h4>
<p>All classes will feel betrayed. It is in this atmosphere that
support for Peron can melt away rapidly and the classes begin to
polarise within and without the Peronist movement. The army caste
will raise its head once again on the basis of the disillusionment
of the masses.</p>

<p>New clashes and strikes will break out. This in turn will have
its effect on the mass movement of Peronism - especially the
trade unions and the youth. This is the key to the revolution,
whose first scene has now been acted out.</p>

<p>Argentine Marxists should be active in the decisive section of
Argentine society. The fate of the coming clashes in the next few
years can be decided by which direction is taken by the
revolutionary youth in Peron's movement.</p>

<p>If, as happened in the Spanish revolution, they should be
corrupted by the &quot;Communist&quot; Party, by in despair
turning in that direction, that could be fatal for the revolution.
That is why the Argentine Marxists should be part of the mass
movement of the young workers in the Peronist movement. They will
turn to Marxism if shown the way.</p>

<p>The Peronist trade unions and the Peronist youth are the
revolution in embryo. The way to the trade union masses is through
the Peronist youth.</p>

<p>The capitalists having clutched the straw of Peronism, will turn
to the stick of the generals once again. Argentina is in for a
period of heightened class struggle and social storms.</p>

<p>The class struggle will have periods of bitter strife and then
periods of lull, to be followed by big strikes and demonstrations,
over a period of months and years it will work out to a conclusion.
It can end in civil war as in Spain.</p>

<p>Argentina is the key to events in Chile, Uruguay, Brazil,
Mexico, indeed all the countries of Latin America. It can have big
repercussions in Spain and the rest of the world.</p>


<h4>Socialism</h4>

<p>The new period of revolutions is beginning in Latin America as
events in Uruguay, Chile and Argentina demonstrate. The fate of all
Latin America can be decided by whether the Peronist youth adopt a
Marxist programme.</p>

<p>The unfolding revolution deserves the most serious study by
militant workers everywhere. Events in Argentina are important too
in the lessons they will teach. A success for the Socialist
revolution in Argentina - leading to workers' democracy
- would provoke the Socialist revolution in all Latin
America. It would strike blows against capitalism and awaken the
workers of the USA to consciousness as a class and to
socialism.</p>

<p>But the struggle against Imperialism and capitalism can only be
carried to a conclusion by the working class. The one cannot be
fought successfully without overthrowing the other.</p>

<p>Only by taking power into their own hands and expropriating
Imperialism, the oligarchy and the native Argentine capitalists can
the Argentine workers prepare the way for decent conditions and
standards - through workers' power and socialism.</p>
