<p class="fst">
The Tories have held on to power
for seven years in the face of a series of setbacks for the working class and
the people of Britain. The Tory Party has shown itself clearly as the party of
the landlords, the bankers and Big Business. And yet Tory rule drags on.
</p>
<p>
The dispirited ranks of the
professional Tories have been encouraged by a regaining, not of support, but of
toleration of the Tory Government among the people. Labour has not seemed to
offer any alternative. In the eyes of the masses, to the strong Tory policy
they have counterposed&#8212;a weak Tory policy.
</p>
<p>
For the
last few years the argument of the trade-union and Labour leadership, under the
inspiration of Gaitskell, has been that only a &#8220;sound and realistic&#8221; policy
could win the uncommitted voters. Nothing must be done to offend the middle
class or the people who vacillate between the parties. &#8220;Extremes&#8221; would
frighten the voters away. Respectability was the thing: they tried to look more
liberal than the Liberals and more staid and solid than the Tories.

</p>
<p>
From a long
term point of view, even if successful such policies would have been disastrous
for the Party and for socialism. With the developing slump, capitalist policies
cannot serve the needs of the people or promote the development of the British
economy.
</p>
<p>
But, as the
Left Wing warned, even from a short-term point of view, such a policy is
shortsighted. The ostensible reason for failing to put forward socialist
policies&#8212;the gaining of a majority at a General Election&#8212;would result in
exactly the opposite. All this is not a question of &#8220;theory,&#8221; which these
&#8220;practical&#8221; politicians just wave aside, but of the realities of the class
struggle itself. All the warnings of the &#8220;impractical dreamers&#8221; have been shown
to be realistic, and the &#8220;realists&#8221; have been shown to be impractical dreamers.

</p>
<h4>Labour
voters dismayed</h4>
<p class="fst">
The Tory
voters have been alienated, the Liberals have turned away, and the wavering
middle-class and non-committed voters so beloved of Gaitskell (remember his
justification of the watering down of policy at the last Labour Conference by
the &#8220;need to win the non-committed voter&#8221;?), have been driven into the arms of
the Tories.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
the Labour voters have been disgusted, demoralised and rendered completely
apathetic. In the last issue of <em>Socialist
Fight</em> we wrote:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;The policy of the Gaitskell leadership, which gives
the impression of the Labour Party as a second-class Tory Party, or at best a
more sober version of the Liberal Party, has obviously failed utterly in its
ostensible purpose. Those who are satisfied with Tory policy will vote Tory.
Those who are dissatisfied will look for something different. The mythical middle
of the road voter, given a choice between two types of Conservative policy,
will obviously plump for the firmer and more reliable one. Hence the policy of
watering down Labour&#8217;s programme alienates all those in the working-class
movement who want to fight capitalism. At the same time, it does not provide a
point of attraction to those awakening for the first time to disgust with the
policies of the Tory Government.

</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;If
Labour continues along this road, it will bring disaster upon itself.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
The <em>latest</em> Gallup Poll has vindicated this
standpoint completely (<em>News Chronicle</em>,
August 25<sup>th</sup>). From the questions put to a cross-section of the
electorate, the following conclusions are drawn.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;This lack of enthusiasm, if it
continues into the General Election, must mean that a high proportion of Labour
supporters will stay at home on polling day.&#8221; It was this which was the main
factor in gaining the victory for the Tories in the last General Election, when
more than two million former Labour voters did not vote.

</p>
<h4>Labour
ranks critical</h4>
<p class="fst">
The survey
goes on:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Critics
within Labour&#8217;s ranks are overwhelmingly of the opinion that Labour policy
needs to become &#8216;a more definite Labour policy.&#8217;
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;For
every one Labour supporter who says that the Labour Party would be less
attractive if the Labour Party moved to the Left, there are six who say that
such a movement, would make the Party more attractive to them. Even among those
who say that they approve of present Labour policy, there would be very little
resistance (8 percent) to a Leftward movement.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;To
sum up: the amazing recovery of Government fortunes lays bare the weakness of
the Labour Party&#8230;The Poll shows that if Labour is to win the election, by
virtue of a positive appeal, the Party has to turn to the Left and establish an
image that is distinct from that of the Conservative Party.&#8221;

</p>
<p class="fst">
What excuse
can the leadership offer now for not giving a clear socialist lead? The
advanced elements of Labour must rouse themselves before it is too late. In
every ward, in every Constituency Party and trade union branch, resolutions
must pour in demanding that the leadership wage a campaign against the Tory
Government on a clear socialist programme.
</p>
<h4>Bold
leadership wanted</h4>
<p class="fst">
A General
Election cannot be delayed for very much longer. The Gallup Poll proves what
the members want, what the workers want, what the voters want.
</p>
<p>
It is
fashionable in top trade union and Labour circles to blame the members and the
workers for not going out on the knocker and conducting a campaign. The same
argument on the industrial front has been annihilatingly refuted by the London
bus and dock strikes. The workers will respond to a fighting lead. This will be
even more true of the political front. What is wanted is bold socialist
leadership bashing capitalism all along the line.
</p>
<p>
The
atmosphere of disillusionment, of apathy, of despair and of indifference is the
entire responsibility of the leadership. Let Labour give a fighting lead and
the situation in Britain would be transformed.
</p>
<p>
However,
advanced workers must ask themselves the question: how is it that the
leadership has been able to get away with such disastrous policies for so long?
It is because of lack of a conscious Left Wing in every trade union and
Constituency Party, around a programme such as that put forward by <em>Socialist Fight</em>, which can act as a
spearhead to the whole Labour Movement and the whole working-class.
