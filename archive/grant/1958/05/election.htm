Following on the by-elections
comes the defeat of the Tories at the County Council polls. It is clear that
the big majority of the people want the Tories out. The workers, and sections
of the professional people and middle class, have given a firm vote of no
confidence in the policies of the Conservatives. Seven years of Tory government
have brought in their train a worsening of the conditions of the workers, small
business people and middle class.
</p>
<p>
The Rent
Act, the credit squeeze, taxation of the poor to lighten the burden on the
rich, represent a deliberate policy on the part of the Tory Government in
favour of Big Business.
</p>
<p>
The Budget has been the last
straw, coming as it does on top of attacks on the social services. The general
economic slump has brought the beginning of mass unemployment, especially in
some of the former distressed areas. The increase in the cost of living has
forced one union after another to table wage demands, which the Government is
preparing to resist with all the force it dare use. The myth that &#8220;Conservative
freedom works&#8221; has been shattered by the bitter realities of the situation in
Britain today.
</p>
<p>
In this
crisis, what is needed is a fighting lead from the Labour Movement to mobilise
the working people against the Tories; above all, the working class must be
given a lead. Harold Wilson, in his speech at Glasgow on April 27<sup>th</sup>
dealing with Government foreign policy, said that there ought to be a General
Election.
</p>
<h4>Force
Tories to quit</h4>
<p class="fst">
It is not
enough merely to call for a General Election, merely to &#8220;give the Tories notice
to quit.&#8221; They must be <em>forced</em> to
quit. An uninspired campaign on the part of the leadership has meant that the
Labour vote has not risen as it should have done in the by-elections. Suez
showed what the Labour Movement can do if it is really mobilised around a clear
issue.
</p>
<p>
The entire resources of the Labour
Movement must be mobilised for a campaign on the stark issues facing the
working people now. From slump to slump and war to war&#8212;that is the programme of
capitalism nationally and internationally. A campaign on fundamental issues, on
a positive programme of socialism nationally and internatiohally, would sweep
the country.
</p>
<p>
Every
worker in the country is in fear of losing his job. Every small man has the
fear of bankruptcy looming ahead. Technicians and professional people also
regard the future with dread. All can be drawn behind the organised Labour
Movement if an inspiring lead is given.
</p>
<p>
Gaitskell&#8217;s
watering down of the Labour Party programme ostensibly to make it more
&#8220;respectable&#8221; in the eyes of Liberals and middle-class voters has been a total
fiasco.
</p>
<h4>Tell
the truth</h4>
<p class="fst">
The way to
win workers who vote Tory and Liberal, and to win the middle class and small
business people, is to <em>tell them the
truth</em>, the plain unvarnished facts. The continued existence of capitalism
will bring unemployment, wage cuts, poverty and insecurity to the mass of the
people.
</p>
<p>
Once again the paradox of poverty
amid abundance faces us. The productive capacity of the country, which could
produce an abundant standard of living for all, is not being utilised. Industry
is being run not for use, but for the private profit of the big banks,
insurance tycoons, monopolies and big landowners. It is this that is the cause
of the swiftly developing crisis, which threatens to tear society apart.
</p>
<p>
A programme
must be worked out by the National Council of Labour and directed to every
trade union and Labour Party organisation in the country, so as to mobilise the
people for a campaign to drive out the Tories <em>now</em>. Such a socialist appeal would draw into action every section
of the movement, from top to bottom&#8212;a campaign of meetings, demonstrations,
strikes, would force the Government to resign.
</p>
<h4>Prepare
a plan</h4>
<p class="fst">
Every
militant in the Labour Movement must ask: what is the leadership doing on this
question? What is the programme to face the developing slump?
</p>
<p>
Nationalise
the land, banks, factories, insurance companies and all private concerns
employing more than 20 workers, with minimum compensation to shareholders on
the basis of need!
</p>
<p>
Prepare a
plan for production with the full participation and control of the workers,
through their shop stewards and trade union organisations!
</p>
<p>
Link the
struggle of the workers in Britain with that of the European workers and the
colonial peoples!
</p>
<p>
A programme
on these lines, pushed systematically and in campaign fashion, could not fail
to gain a majority in the General Election which would be forced.
