<p class="fst">
The Lebanese civil war began with the
assassination of Nassib Metni, editor of a left-wing journal called <em>The Telegraph</em>. Although a Christian, he
was opposed to the policies of the Christian President, Chamoun, and the ruling
clique.
</p>
<p>
The Opposition, including trade unionists
and the Socialist Party, called a general strike, which rapidly widened into
insurrection in the main cities and over the whole country. After a few weeks
of fighting, most of the Bekaa, the larger towns and large slices of mountain
territory in the North and South, are under the control of the
insurrectionists.
</p>
<p>
The Lebanon is a small strip of territory
bordered by Syria and the sea, only 35 miles wide at its widest point.
Dominated by France before the Second World War, it has been used as a point of
support by Anglo-American imperialism since the war. It is an artificial
creation, with an Arab population of one and a half million, nearly half of
whom are Christians.
</p>
<p>
The ruling class is hopelessly corrupt, and
the regime rotten through and through. Chamoun was the only Middle Eastern
leader who rushed to accept the Eisenhower Doctrine, enthusiastically and
without reservation. This was one of the factors provoking opposition among the
population, both Christian and Muslim. In common with all other Arabs, the
people aspire to union with their brothers in other Arab countries, and are
opposed to the policy of the government of support for the West, particularly
in the light of the Suez events. In the general strike, which has lasted more
than six weeks, not only the workers but the shopkeepers also struck.
</p>
<p>
Immediately Chamoun raised the cry of
massive intervention from the United Arab Republic <sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup>,
and appealed to the United Nations. But the report of the U.N. observers who
patrolled parts of the frontiers has entirely rejected this claim.
</p>
<h4>U.S. hypocrisy</h4>
<p class="fst">
On June 25<sup>th</sup>, five ships sailed
from U.S. ports with 1,700 Marines on board. At the same time, killing two
birds with one stone, 25,000 extra men, including commandos and paratroops, were
sent to Cyprus by the British government. It is clear that if the Opposition
shows signs of gaining the upper hand, the threat of &#8220;direct action&#8221; by
Anglo-American imperialism intervening in the conflict would be carried out.
Thus the hypocrisy of the U.S. imperialists&#8217; attitude at the time of 
Suez <sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup> is exposed.
</p>
<p>
It is not at all concern with the rights of
small nations which has prevented the imperialists from intervening so far, but
fear of the repercussions in the other, oil bearing, Arab states, and the
possibility of a flare-up throughout the Middle East. The imperialists have
however toyed with the idea of allowing other Middle Eastern forces (Iraq,
Jordan) to intervene. Nuri es-Said, Iraqi premier, has threatened the
intervention of Iraqi and Jordanian troops if requested by President Chamoun,
in order to offset the alleged intervening forces from the United Arab
Republic. But the United Arab Federation (Jordan-Iraq) is largely an
Anglo-American puppet <sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">(3)</a></sup>, and this would be
intervention by Anglo-American imperialism at second hand. It is British and
American imperialism who will decide the issue.
</p>
<h4>Despots without support</h4>
<p class="fst">
The real reason for the concern of Nuri es-Said is the effect on the peoples of Iraq, Jordan and the rest of the Middle
East. For the Jordanian and Iraqi governments are despotisms without support
among the people.
</p>
<p>
The situation in the Lebanon has meanwhile
become more confused. Four of the Opposition parties in the Lebanon have been
banned. President Chamoun has armed the Falange, the extreme Right Wing
Christian Party, which has sent its gangs to beat unarmed workers while the
police look on indifferently. The 6,000 strong Army under General Chehab has
played a very equivocal part in the struggle; although 60 percent of the Army are
Christians, to use it in an offensive against the rebels would be to split it
in pieces, and, as in Middle Eastern politics generally, Chehab wants to
preserve it as an unified force for use to back a possible future arbiter. The
Air Force of 2,000 is an additional factor which has been handled with the same
degree of equivocation. Meanwhile, with the stalemate, plague and diseases
threaten the big towns. The leaders of this spontaneous uprising obviously do
not wish to carry forward a real struggle: this explains the fantastic travel
between the lines and the indulgent attitude to it by both sides, and the small
number of casualties. Behind the scenes, U.S. imperialism is trying to patch
together a compromise, probably with a loan to repair the damage and to
maintain the Lebanon in the orbit of Western imperialism. It is significant in
this connection that the Opposition leaders have several times specifically
denied any programme for integration of the Lebanon in the United Arab
Republic.
</p>
<p>
Thus the spontaneous insurrection of the
people has been betrayed into a sordid struggle behind the scenes for position
and power between warring cliques. Chamoun, under pressure, has agreed not to
stand for re-election.
</p>
<p>
However, a patched-up compromise will not
restore peace to the Lebanon or the Middle East for long. The support by
imperialism for all the forces of reaction and privilege prepares the way for
new explosions. The demand for the union of all Arabs into one state and the
complete expulsion of imperialism from the area will gain further strength.
British workers should demand the withdrawal of all troops, the right of the
Arab peoples to unite, with the democratic right of self-determination.
</p>
<h4>
Notes:
</h4>
<p class="fst">
<sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-1" name="foot-1">(1)</a></sup> The U.A.R. was a
union between Egypt and Syria, as a first step towards a pan-Arab state. It
began in 1958, raising widespread support from the Arab masses and existed
until 1961 when Syria seceded from the union.
</p>
<p class="fst">
<sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-2" name="foot-2">(2)</a></sup> On October 29<sup>th</sup>
1956, an Israeli, British and French coordinated attack against Egypt led to the
invasion of the Sinai Peninsula and seized control of the Suez Canal. The
attack was in retaliation against the decision of Egyptian president Nasser to
nationalize the Suez Canal announced on July 26<sup>th</sup>. Although
initially successful from a military point of view the imperialist aggression
against Egypt stirred up mass support for Nasser and against all the
reactionary regimes that were supporting imperialist aggression throughout the
Middle East. This forced the British and French to back off in a humiliating
defeat.
</p>
<p class="fst">
<sup class="anote"><a href="#doc-3" name="foot-3">(3)</a></sup> The reactionary
&#8220;Baghdad Pact&#8221; suddenly collapsed because of the insurrection of July 14<sup>th</sup>,
1958 that put an end to the Hashemite pro Anglo-American Monarchy in Iraq.
