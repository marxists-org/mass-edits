The Tories
have begun already a systematic preparation for the next General Election. Side
by side with their attacks on the workers, they are trying desperately to
present themselves as a party of progress and &#8220;sound finance.&#8221; That is why
they, are trying to steal the Labour Party&#8217;s thunder by announcing a new
pensions plan which will intensify and perpetuate the inequalities among
pensioners, which reflect the inequality in society at large.
</p>
<p>
The growing
unemployment is regarded as a &#8220;regrettable necessity&#8221; in order to damp
inflation and stabilise the value of the pound. In reality, all these measures
are neither to the advantage of the workers nor the middle class, but of the
Big Business paymasters of the Tory Party, who do not turn a hair at spending
&#163;1,500 million a year on armaments, but with eagle eye scrutinise every
halfpenny spent on pensions, social services, housing and education. They have
cut the amount spent on all these in relation to the total budget.
</p>
<p>
The Tories
have extended big concessions to the millionaire tax-payers. The Rent Act has
been a gift to the landlords.
</p>
<p>
Against
this background, the Labour Movement must rally all its forces and resources in
order to defeat the Tory attack and win the next election. What is required is
a militant, positive Socialist campaign, which will explain concretely to the
workers and middle class how they will benefit socially and economically under
a planned economy, where full rights and liberties, of the people will be
maintained and the entire population will be drawn into the running of industry
and the state.
</p>
<p>
A campaign
on these lines explaining the ominous slump developments of which mounting
unemployment is a symptom and showing that capitalism has no real solution to
these problems except at the expense of the mass of the people would gain
overwhelming support.
</p>
<h4>Gaitskell&#8217;s promises</h4>
<p class="fst">
Unfortunately,
the official programme of the Labour Movement as developed at Scarborough is
not on these lines. In <em>Plan for Progress</em>
and in Gaitskell&#8217;s speeches, fabulous promises have been made: expanding
production, full employment, housing, pensions, social services, comprehensive
schools, a stable pound, higher wages and lower prices&#8212;the lot. This is an
excellent programme&#8230;if it can be carried out.
</p>
<p>
Following
the Conference, Gaitskell has made a tour of the areas worst affected by
unemployment. He has been able to expose the cold-blooded calculations of the
ruling class, which wishes to hold down the wages of the employed workers by
the pressure of the workers on the dole, living below subsistence level. The
Tories plan to put the full burdens of the developing slump on the shoulders of
the workers, pensioners and middle class.
</p>
<p>
Gaitskell&#8217;s
solution to this is &#8220;an expanding economy&#8221; on which stands or falls all the
golden promises which have been made by the Labour leaders. He emphasised (TV
broadcast, October 27<sup>th</sup>) that to meet the threat of growing
unemployment interest rates must be cut, industrial investment increased and
new industries channelled into needy areas. &#8220;And if I thought it necessary to
stimulate the economy, I would introduce an autumn budget.&#8221;
</p>
<h4>Mere stop-gaps</h4>
<p class="fst">
Under slump
conditions, all these measures would be no more than stop-gaps. The rate of
interest will fall anyway under conditions of slump, and the capitalists will
not invest in new industry and new capital development when they cannot make
profit, from the old industry and machinery. Gaitskell&#8217;s whole criticism of the
capitalists leaves out of account the fact that they do not produce for the
sake of producing, but only for the sake of making profits.
</p>
<p>
The amount,
moreover, collected in taxes from the workers and capitalists will fall so that
there will be less money to invest in the nationalised industries. If resort is
made to deficit financing, after a period this will cancel out, and the
position will be worse than before because of gathering inflation. At the same
time, it would be ridiculous to invest in nationalised industries, which are
the basic industries in the country and which serve largely the needs of
private industry, because the orders from private industry will naturally fall.
Already there is a surplus capacity in steel and coal. Under conditions of
slump, it would be madness to invest further in coal, steel, rail transport,
electricity and gas when there would be enormous unused capacities in these
industries. Moreover, the money would have to come from private industry or the
working class, and would thus cancel out in its effects even if it were tried.
</p>
<p>
A small
amount might be gained, by building hospitals, roads and so on. But this would
only be tackling the fringe of the problem. <em>It
is impossible to operate capitalism better than the capitalists.</em>
</p>
<p>
On this
programme a Labour Government could only hope for a short life before
disillusionment and disaster would be facing it. British history in the last
decades, as the history of other countries, has demonstrated the painful lesson
that only socialist policies can serve the Labour Movement.
</p>
<p>
The Marxist
Left in the Labour Party must be the most vigorous in campaigning to get the
Tories out, as the next step forward. At the same time, however, while fighting
shoulder to shoulder with their fellow trade unionists and Labour Party
members, they must campaign for a real programme of drastic socialist measures
to be introduced under emergency circumstances when the failures of the present
policy will be <em>proved</em> by bitter
experience. Take action against the capitalists, carry out your promises, and
if a Socialist Plan is the only road, then a Socialist Plan of nationalisation
with minimum compensation, and the running of industry and the state by the
workers and their allies, must be the watchword of the Left Wing inside the
Movement.
