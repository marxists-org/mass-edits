Conference is thequestion of its relations to the Labour Party.  </p><p>  The N.A.C. has put down a resolution asking for theI.L.P. to apply for affiliation to the Labour Party on the same basis asexisted before the I.L.P. voluntarily disaffiliated from the Labour Party.  </p><p>  In making such a complete reversalof the position which it adopted for so many years, one would expect that theleadership (which occasionally makes references to Marx and Lenin as its guide)would draw up a balance sheet of the period since the separation.  </p><p>  The only leading member of the I.L.P. who hasattempted to explain the reason for the change, was John McGovern at the I.L.P.Summer School of August 1944. In dealing with the history of the I.L.P.    as reported in the <em>New Leader</em> of August 19<sup>th</sup>, 1944, he madereference to the achievements of the I.L.P. since disaffiliation: </p><p class="quoteb">	  &#8220;He	considered the position of the Party at the time of disaffiliation and	confessed that he thought &#8216;The I.L.P.&#8217;s case was    so clear that every intelligent      worker would have to accept the I.L.P. attitude and	philosophy, and desire to build with it a strong working class movement in this	country. A large number of people encouraged the Party at that time to believe	that this was true, and got it to leave the Labour Party and then proceeded to	work their own way back Into that Party. In those days we went round the	country as an independent working class party, and thought that once the faith	of the workers in the Labour Party had been destroyed we would be able to	transfer these workers from the Labour Party to the I.L.P. It now transpires	that we made errors both in judgment and in policy&#8217;.&#8221;  </p><p class="quoteb">	  &#8220;Comrade	McGovern began a critical examination of the party policy after disaffiliation,	and stated that &#8216;one early mistake was our 	association with the Communist Party, especially at a time when there was	tremendous antagonism in this country against the C.P. In many areas where the	I.L.P. had an agreement with the C.P. a large number of members left the Party.	This series of united fronts prod   uced small effects, but drove out many workers&#8217;.&#8221;   </p><p class="quoteb">	  &#8220;Believing	that self-criticism in the Party was necessary, the lecturer went on to	consider the internal struggles in the Party, instancing the R.C.P., the	Trotskyists, and later the disputes    between Stalinists and  Trotskyists  	within the Party, which re sulted in &#8216;purges&#8217; and	loss of membership. He stated that he had been asked on many occasions, by	those who appeared to accept as logical the Party position, what guarantee he	could give that the development of	the I.L.P. would not be similar to that of the Labour Party, and he considered	that he could give these individuals no guarantee such as they asked.&#8221;   </p><p>  Without giving an analysis of the evolution of theI.L.P., McGovern echoes the criticism made by Leon Trotsky long ago. HereMarxist theory demonstrates its superiority over centrist empiricism.  </p><p>  Trotsky had pointed out that the manner, the timingand the issue on which the I.L.P. left the Labour Party were not such as tomake the position clear in the eyes of the masses. The issue on which the    split occurred&#8212;that of refusing to accept the discipline of theparliamentary Labour Party by the I.L.P. M.P.s&#8212;was not sufficiently clear cutto gain the sympathy and support of the masses. The naive confession ofMcGovern as to his belief in the automatic turning of the masses from theLabour Party to the I.L.P. is a faithful reflection of the illusions of theentire leadership at the time of the break. A belief which was entirely aliento the teachings of Marxism. </p><p> The masses do not automatically accept a Party&#8212;even if it has a correctpolicy and programme&#8212;but must be won to the programme as a result of correctstrategy and tactics. Only if the revolutionary Party has a firm theoreticalbasis and an understanding of the method of approach to the masses&#8212;blurredneither by sectarianism nor opportunism&#8212;can it prepare for its historic task,the overthrow of capitalism. </p><p> Trotsky warned the I.L.P. that their association in a united front withthe Stalinist Party (which had since the capitulation of the German C.P. becomea thoroughly reactionary obstacle in the path of the working class) would bedisastrous for it. Trotsky suggested that the I.L.P. turn its back on the&#8212;atthat time&#8212;tiny C.P. and face towards the mass organisations of the Trade Unions and the Labour Party. Butthe I.L.P. leaders paid no heed. They continued their association with theStalinists and as late as 1935-36 participated with the Stalinists in theill-fated &#8220;Unity Campaign&#8221; togetherwith the Socialist League. This was at a time when the Stalinists in Spain werealready campaigning against the brother Party of the I.L.P.&#8212;the P.O.U.M.&#8212;as&#8220;Trotskyist-fascist&#8221; and &#8220;Fifth Columnists&#8221;! To this day the leadership of theI.L.P. has not made an analysis of the mistakes made in this period. </p><p> The last point made in this quotation from McGovern is an entirely soundone. No party in the world, subjected to the constant pressure and corruptionof the capitalist environment, can guarantee itself against degeneration,  even though it be the most tested revolutionaryand Marxist Party developed in history. The possibility always exists of theParty becoming a tool of the capitalists, as are   the Labour Partyand the  Communist Party today. The onlyprecautions that those desiring to   build a revolutionary partyhave, is to ensure that the Party is based on the principles and the methods ofMarxism; to ensure, on that basis, that every point of view within the Party isthoroughly aired and discussed. Only by complete democracy in the Party whichpermits every member or grouping the right to bring forward their point ofview, can a live, watchful and educated rank and file be created which willhave full confidence in the leadership and simultaneously guard against thepossibility of degeneration. These are the only moral and honest means ofensuring a united party and a correct policy. These were the methods ofBolshevism in its great days, and without which the Bolshevik Party could neverhave been built and succeeded in achieving the conquest of power. The stiflingof democratic rights by Zinoviev, and later by Stalin&#8212;in itself a reflection ofprocesses taking place within the country&#8212;paved the way for the completedisintegration of the mightiest revolutionary weapon the world has ever known.As McGovern has hinted, unfortunately the leadership has not always allowed thefull freedom of criticism which is necessary in any party which desires totransform itself into a revolutionary party. In a bureaucratic attitude on thepart of any leadership, is contained an uneasiness in the correctness of itspolicy, past and future. </p><p> In preparing to re-affiliate, nowhere has the leadership of the I.L.P.explained the differences, if any, between the situation either of the I.L.P.or the Labour Party <em>which would justifyre-affiliation on the same terms as led the I.L.P. to disaffiliate in 1932</em>.Much water has flowed under the bridges since those days; but the character of theLabour Party and its leadership has not changed basically in the interim,except perhaps that the leadership has become even more reactionary thanformerly. </p><p> And while there have been many profound changes in the composition andoutlook of the rank and file of the I.L.P. the leadership has remainedbasically with the same outlook as when it was in the Labour Party. They havenever broken with reformism, but have maintained a middle way position betweenreformism and Marxism. This, and only this, explains their present attitudetowards the Labour Party and affiliation to it. </p><p> In 1935, Comrade Trotsky wrote in &#8220;Once Again: the I.L.P.&#8221;</a> in reply to the question, &#8220;Should the I.L.P. seek entry into the LabourParty?&#8221; </p><p class="quoteb">	  &#8220;At the moment the question is not	posed this way. What the    I.L.P. must do if it is to become a revolutionary	Party, is to turn  its back on the C.P. and	face the mass organisations. It must put 99 percent of its energies into	building up fractions in the Trade Union movement. At the   moment	I understand that much  of the fractional work	can be done openly by I.L.P.ers in their capacity of Trade Union and	co-operative members. But the I.L.P. should never rest content; it must build	its influence in the   mass organisations with the utmost speed and	energy. For the time may come, when, in order  to	reach the masses, it might enter the Labour Party, and it must have tracks laid	for the occasion. Only the experience that comes from such fractional   work	can inform the I.L.P. if  and when it must enter	the Labour Party. But for all its activity an absolutely clear programme is the	first condition, a small axe can fell a large tree only if it is sharp enough.&#8221;   
	<sup><a href="../../../trotsky/1936/xx/ilp.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>

<p>  What Trotsky is developing here isthe idea that affiliation or non-affiliation is not a principled question, butone of tactics. For the revolutionary party, the problem reduces itself to oneof how best to reach and influence the mass of the workers and win them torevolutionary socialism. <em>But before onecan do that, it is necessary to have a Marxian programme which decisivelydifferentiates the Party from all other Parties, especially from Labourreformism</em>.  </p><p> Yet even in its hey-day of&#8220;revolutionary socialism&#8221;, the I.L.P. never completely broke fromparliamentarism and reformism. Today, after 13 years of separation from theLabour Party, the <em>New Leader</em> of March31<sup>st</sup> 1945, published on the eve of the Conference to decide thequestion of affiliation, can write: </p><p class="quoteb">	  <strong>&#8220;Labour Follows I.L.P.&#8221;</strong></p><p class="quoteb">	 &#8220;The I.L.P. Conference meets	at Blackpool at Easter. The Labour Party	Conference meets in the same place at Whitsun. </p><p class="quoteb">	 &#8220;The	preliminary agenda of the latter Conference has just been issued, and it is	interesting to compare it with the agenda of the I.L.P. Conference. </p><p class="quoteb">	 &#8220;Similar	subjects are dealt with, and on domestic issues&#8212;housing, monopolies and land,	for example&#8212;there is little difference in principle between many of the	resolutions on both agendas. It is when one passes to the resolutions on the	Peace and the treatment of Germany	that the difference becomes most marked, though even here the Labour Party	agenda includes resolutions which express the international socialist attitude. </p><p class="quoteb">	 &#8220;The truth is, however, that	the Labour Party agenda is always better than Labour Party policies.&#8221;</p><p> This is not at all as the writer of these lines infers: that the LabourParty rank and file is adopting a revolutionary position, and therefore theresemblance. It is because the I.L.P.&#8217;s position remains basically reformistthat the comparison becomes possible. </p><p> The content of the resolutions put before the Labour Party Conferencethis year do not differ from those put forward on any previous years, includingthe year of disaffiliation, 1932. It remains incomprehensible then, why theI.L.P. disaffiliated at all, if this argument is accepted. No more annihilatingcriticism could be made than that the resolutions are not much different fromthose on the Labour Party agenda. </p><p> We Trotskyists have been attackedconsistently by the I.L.P. leaders for our criticisms of their attitude towardsthe Labour Party, which veered from left to right. Thus Trotsky said in thesame interview quoted above: </p><p class="quoteb">	 &#8220;The basic	error which was made by some I.L.P.ers who withdrew critical support [of the	Labour Party] was to assume that the war danger necessitated a change in our	appreciation of reformism. But as Clausewitz said, and Lenin often repeated, <em>war is the continuation of politics by other	means</em>. If this is true, it applies not only to capitalist parties, but to	social democratic parties. The war crisis does not alter the fact that the	Labour Party is a workers&#8217; party, which the Government Party is not. Nor does	it alter the fact that the Labour leadership cannot fulfil their promises, that	they will betray the confidence which the masses place in them. In peace time	the workers will, if they trust in social democracy, die of hunger; in war, for	the same reason, they will die from bullets. Revolutionists never give critical	support to reformism on the assumption that reformism, in power, could satisfy	the fundamental needs of the workers. It is possible, of course, that a Labour	Government could introduce a few mild temporary reforms. It is also possible	that the League [of Nations] could postpone a military conflict about secondary	issues&#8212;just as a cartel can eliminate secondary economic crises only to	reproduce them on a larger scale. So the League can eliminate small episodic	conflicts to generalise them into world war. </p><p class="quoteb">	 &#8220;Thus, both economic and	military crises will only return with an added explosive force so long as	capitalism remains. And we know that	social democracy cannot abolish capitalism. </p><p class="quoteb">	 &#8220;No, in war as in peace, the	I.L.P. must say to the workers: &#8216;The Labour Party will deceive you and betray	you, but you do not believe us. Very well, we will go through your experiences	with you but in no case do we identify ourselves with the Labour Party	programme&#8217;.&#8221; <sup><a href="../../../trotsky/1936/xx/ilp.htm">[source]</a></sup></p><p> What a world of difference betweenthis revolutionary attitude, and the open, boastful identification of the&#8220;revolutionary&#8221; programme of the I.L.P. with the reformist programme of theLabour Party! The I.L.P. objected to giving critical support to the LabourParty in those days because the Labour Party policy was one of support forimperialist war. Today, after the Labour Party has dirtied its banner a secondtime in support of the capitalists in war, the I.L.P. gives them a clean billof health as &#8220;Socialists&#8221;. They prepare for the coming General Election byrushing to get on the bandwagon of the Labour Party. Not that the Labour Partywill cease to support imperialist wars&#8212;that would be too much to expect fromthe new found socialists&#8212;but after all, the attitude towards war is only a meredifference of opinion in the eyes of Brockway these days. The Labour Partyinside or outside the Government will continue either as a governing. Party oras a &#8220;loyal opposition&#8221; to support the blatantly imperialist war against Japan in orderto aid the capitalists in getting back the loot and the slaves which theJapanese capitalists have grabbed from them. </p><p> Yet it is not so long ago that the leaders sought with might and main todifferentiate themselves from what they described as the &#8220;doomed&#8221; Labour Party.During the first phase of the war, Brockway, Ridley, Padley and others viedwith one another in predicting the collapse of the Labour Party. The I.L.P.then developed the idea that the masses would by-pass the Labour Party, andcome straight to the side of the proponents of the &#8220;Socialist Britain Now&#8221;campaign. Today, that campaign has been relegated to the limbo of centrist LostCauses. It has been quietly buried without fuss or explanation. At the time ofits inception, it was subjected to a Marxian criticism, and its inevitable demise was predicted in thecolumns of <em>Workers&#8217; International News</em>and the <em>Socialist Appeal</em>. </p><p> The ultra-left notion, that because the Labour Party had betrayed theworkers, all that was necessary was for them to hang out a signboard &#8220;SocialismNow&#8221;, received its crassest expression in the articles of the sectarian,Ridley. Let us see what he wrote because he gave a finished expression to allthe mistakes of the I.L.P. leadership; their inability to understand theproblem of the Labour Party and how to face up to it. Criticising theTrotskyists who were demanding that the Labour leaders end the shamelesscoalition with the capitalists and wage a struggle for power on a socialistprogramme, as a means of educating the workers through their own experience,Ridley gleefully jibed: </p><p class="quoteb">	 &#8220;In fact, everything indicates	that this war will mark the end of the Labour Party just as the last one did	that of its liberal predecessor, despite the valiant efforts of the	Trotskyists, to revive the fast putrefying corpse. The spirit died in it long	ago. After all, even Christ gave up the dead as hopeless after three days!&#8221; (<em>New Leader</em>, February 21<sup>st</sup>,	1942). </p><p> It might be pointed out that this is not the most foolish statement madeby leaders of the I.L.P. Padley, Brockway and others all argued that to givesupport&#8212;critical support at that&#8212;to the Labour Party, and demand that they takepower on a socialist programme, would be to deceive the workers and sowillusions in the Labour leaders who had betrayed the workers. If there was agrain of sense in their arguments of that time, it was that the reactionaryreformists of the Labour Party could not fundamentally alter the conditions ofthe masses when in power. Now, they have thrown overboard the only correct partof their criticism, and have fallen into the very abyss which they claimed theTrotskyist policy would lead to. They now deceive the workers into believingthat the Labour Party can accomplish the Socialist Revolution. </p><p> Thus, insofar as their policy can affect events, they smooth the path ofreaction, both inside and outside the Labour Party. </p><p> Trotsky once wrote that a sectarian is merely an opportunist afraid ofhis own opportunism. We have seen what Ridley wrote in the past. Let us hearhis words of wisdom today. In the <em>NewLeader</em> of June 20<sup>th</sup>, 1945, Ridley writes: </p><p class="quoteb">	 &#8220;The Labour Party is the mass	Party of the British Trade Unions, and, in general, of the more politically	conscious workers. It is also &#8216;His Majesty&#8217;s Opposition&#8217;. For which reasons it	occupies an important contemporary role in British politics. It has this great	advantage over the Tories that it still commands an extensive reserve of	enthusiasm and moral idealism amongst its rank and file. Though it must be	added that the present leadership of the Party hasn&#8217;t a glimmering of a notion	as to what to do with this great potentially socialist and revolutionary force.	This last fact was very obvious at the recent Labour Party Conference, where	not so much a gulf, as an abyss, divided the platform from the rank and file.&#8221; </p><p> Not so much a gulf as an abyss separates the Ridley of 1945 from theRidley of 1942. But let us go further: </p><p class="quoteb">	 &#8220;The question of the survival	of the Labour Party, and the possibility of its continuing to play any role in	the Socialist transformation of British society depends upon whether the rank	and file of the Party can throw up a new leadership which adequately reflects,	and will continue to reflect in or out of office, its point of view, free from	the domination of the Trade Union bureaucracy. And this, in its turn depends on	whether the Labour Party regards itself as a federal structure, including all	Socialist trends, revolutionary as well as reformist; or whether, as at	present, as an intolerant monolithic top-heavy structure committed to endless	compromises, and to the philosophy of a dead age, itself the product of extinct	material conditions. </p><p class="quoteb">	 &#8220;The	next General Election may put the Labour Party in power. Then will come its	supreme test, for 1945, unlike 1924 and 1929-31, is an age of revolution versus	counter-revolution, and any British Government (of whatever shade) must choose	one or the other camps.&#8221; </p><p> The miracle is achieved; Ridley has succeeded in bettering theaccomplishments of Christ! Whereas Christ gave up hope for the dead after threedays, Ridley has revived the stinking corpse after three years! Naturally,under such circumstances, the smell is overpowering. </p><p> Think of it. Ridley parades as a Marxian historian, and yet raises thequestion as to whether the Labour Party in power will support revolution orcounter-revolution! </p><p> The Labour Party, as a party, will always act to defend the &#8220;democratic&#8221;counter-revolution against the proletarian revolution in a revolutionarysituation. In power, the Labour Party, with or without a majority, would act asit did in 1924 and 1929. That there would be splits and revolts within theranks, even at the top, inside and outside Parliament in such an event, is anentirely different question. </p><p> What would be the attitude of a genuine revolutionary party towards theproblem of affiliation? In order to disguise its complete and unconditionalsurrender to the reformism of the Labour Party, the I.L.P. leadership suggeststhat it will affiliate only after the truce has been broken and the coalitionended. Why? The Labour Party will still be the same Labour Party, except thatwith a fake &#8220;opposition&#8221; to the Tories, the leadership will be even moredangerous than before. It can allow itself the luxury of criticising theTories, which can lead the rank and file to believe that the Labour Partyleaders intend to wage a real struggle for Socialism. But at the coming GeneralElection, the Labour Party will not, and cannot put a fighting Socialist case,for fear it may gain a majority. And it fears that a majority would expose itsincapacity to carry through any large scale measures against capitalism and inthe interests of the working class. Nor is there any absolute certainty thatthe Labour Party may not enter another coalition after the election, althoughthis is unlikely because of the pressure of the rank and file. </p><p> Would the I.L.P. in that case, disaffiliate from the Labour Party? Youwould search in vain for an answer to this question from the pro-affiliationistwing of the I.L.P. </p><p> If the I.L.P. were a genuine Marxist Party, the problem would beapproached from an entirely different standpoint. The Labour Party is the massorganisation of the working class. In order to win the workers to the banner ofrevolutionary socialism, it would facilitate matters if the revolutionaries hadthe right to put their point of view directly to the workers inside the LabourParty. If, given the right of criticism, affiliation would assist in educatingthe Labour Party workers. Under such circumstances, the rapid regroupment ofthe workers in the Labour Party around a revolutionary programme and bannerwould become a possibility. Fighting side by side in the ranks with the Labourworkers, we would be in a betterposition to convince them of the necessity for a Marxist programme and the futilityof reformism. </p><p> Thus the leftward swing of the workers would lead to a strengthening ofthe revolutionary tendencies within the Labour Party, without in any waysacrificing the principles for which we stand. </p><p> In approaching the Labour Party for affiliation all negotiations wouldbe conducted publicly, in full-view of the workers, and the reasons for such astep honestly explained without in any way abandoning our revolutionaryposition, or our criticism and exposure of the Labour leaders. On these conditions,we would be prepared to affiliate, even if the Labour Party remained in thecoalition. </p><p> Basically, our approach towards affiliation is no different than ourapproach to the problem of the Labour Government. Affiliation would havetremendous advantages in the establishment of a closer bond with the rank andfile Labour workers. If the Labour leaders refused to accept us, the workerswould see them as the splitters, especially if previously we had waged acampaign on the issue in the factoriesand trade unions, and secured some support among the Labour workers. </p><p> However, in spite of the opportunist approach of the I.L.P. leadership,the affiliation of the I.L.P. to the Labour Party would be a progressive step.Some comrades in the I.L.P. oppose affiliation because they correctly see inthe policy of the N.A.C., a capitulation to the reformist Labour leaders. Butin opposing the false reformist approach of the N.A.C., they make mistakes of asectarian character. Even if the I.L.P. were a revolutionary Party, affiliationwould be progressive. But with the present position, affiliation should helpenormously in clarifying the situation within the I.L.P. and all the tendencieswithin it. There is no fundamental difference separating the Labour Lefts fromthe I.L.P. leaders. The differences between them are entirely artificial. Thereis no real political reason why they should not be together. </p><p> It is true, that the Labour leaders, or a large section of them, havetheir own reasons for desiring the affiliation of the I.L.P. They realise onlytoo well that in the coming period those organisations which stood out againstthe war will become more attractive to the disillusioned workers and soldiers.In face of the coming upsurge of the workers, the Labour leaders will require a&#8220;Left&#8221; cover in order to retain the support of the masses. In theircalculations, the I.L.P. will serve this purpose. </p><p> That was how the situation worked out after the last war, and they hopethat history will repeat itself. However, the situation is entirely differenttoday. The I.L.P. will enter the Labour Party on the eve of a tremendousferment and explosion among the masses. Far from the tranquil existenceanticipated by the I.L.P. leadership, the I.L.P. would inevitably act as thecrystallising point for the awakening Labour workers. Both the fresh recruits,and the older stratum of industrial members will demand a revolutionary policy.Thus the differentiation within the I.L.P. would be intensified between thereformist wing and the revolutionary wing. <em>Therevolutionary wing, if it worked out a Marxist policy and programme, wouldenormously accelerate the revolutionary regroupment within the Labour movement.</em> </p><p> Whether inside the Labour Party, or outside, the organic left-reformismor at best, centrism of the I.L.P. leadership stands in the way of the I.L.P.adopting a revolutionary position. Entry into the Labour Party will force them to show their hand. The best memberswill come to see exactly where the leadership really stands. The new and virilemembers who will enter the Labour Party would fuse with the I.L.P. Left wing.True, the I.L.P. would be flooded also by Left parliamentarians, pacifists andcareerists. But these would rapidly separate themselves from the I.L.P. rankand file and become assimilated with the leadership, dragging it further to theRight. This again, would have its effects on the rank and file. </p><p> On the background of tremendous storms on the industrial and politicalfields, both the Labour Party and the I.L.P. will be shaken from top to bottom.Affiliation of the I.L.P. to the Labour Party seems to be a foregoneconclusion: but it will neither avail the reformist leadership of the LabourParty, nor the centrist leadership of the I.L.P. It will act as an acceleratorof all the processes of change and movement taking place within bothorganisations. The revolutionary workers in both parties, in the course oftheir own experience will begin toperceive that only the programme and methodsof Bolshevism, only the programme of the Fourth International can lead to theoverthrow of the capitalist system and the victory of the Socialist Revolution. </p><p class="skip">&nbsp;</p><hr class="end" /><p class="footer"><a href="../../index.htm">Ted GrantArchive</a></p></body></html>
