<p class="fst">The general election has resulted 
in a smashing victory for the working class. Despite the lies, slander 
and misrepresentation of the Tories and the capitalist press, Churchill 
and his following have been overwhelmingly defeated.</p>
<p>Although the Labour leaders 
did not campaign against Churchill and expose him for what he represented, 
nevertheless the masses showed that they were not deceived as to what 
was concealed behind the Churchill myth.</p>
<p>In Churchill&rsquo;s own constituency 
where the Labour leaders timidly and faint-heartedly withdrew, an unknown 
crank who conducted no campaign, received 10,000 votes in opposition 
to Churchill&rsquo;s 27,000. This is an index of the changed and determined 
mood of the people.</p>
<p>A tremendous radicalisation 
of broad strata of the population has taken place. Especially has this 
been so with the young generation of voters who have grown up in the 
last decade and have never had the vote before. The men in the armed 
forces conscripted to fight in the interests of British imperialism 
and hardened by their experiences in the Army, Navy and Air Force, have 
turned overwhelmingly against capitalism and everything that it stands 
for. It is estimated that at least 80 to 90 per cent of the servicemen 
who polled, voted for the Labour Party. When it is considered that millions 
of workers inside and outside of the Forces were disenfranchised by 
the rushed election and that the bulk of these would have voted Labour, 
the magnitude of the Tory defeat is clear. The Tories staged the election 
at the most suitable time for themselves, had they waited any longer 
their debacle at the polls would have been even greater.</p>
<p>The difference between the 
election of 1918 and that of 1945 is very striking. The last 30 years, 
with its record of slumps and wars, of misery and unemployment, have 
taught the masses that they cannot expect anything better at the hands 
of the Tories. Not only the basic strata of the working class, but even 
large sections of the middle class have swung decisively away from the 
capitalist parties.</p>
<p>The election of a majority 
Labour Government for the first time marks a definite decisive turn 
in European, world and British history. In voting for the Labour Party, 
the mass of the British workers have indicated that they want a complete 
change from the capitalist system which has brought them such misery, 
poverty, and insecurity in the years following World War I.</p>
<p>Labour is in Power! Now the 
workers want radical solutions to the urgent problems which face them. 
Work, Food, Homes, Demobilisation, higher standards, and a different 
policy from that of Tory reaction both at home and abroad, is demanded 
by the working class. They want a fighting lead on a radical programme, 
and drastic measures against the Big Monopolies and Combines would secure 
the enthusiastic and active assistance of the workers.</p>
<p>A tremendously important feature 
of the election, and one showing the real tendencies and feelings in 
the electorate, was not only the defeat of the Conservative Party, but 
the smashing blow sustained by the Liberals. Despite the lavish promises 
of the capitalist Liberal Party, and the fact that they stood on an 
anti-Tory ticket, they lost half their already shrunken representation 
of 20 seats. In the seats held by the Liberals, the Labour Party vote 
generally increased as greatly as it had done in the Tory areas. Thus 
the swing from the Conservatives was no mere swing of the pendulum, 
but an anti-capitalist move against the exploiting class and in favour 
of Socialism.</p>
<p>The defeat of the Liberals 
and Tories has also meant the defeat of the &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; Party. 
Their Popular Front policy calling for a National Government, including 
the Liberals and such &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; Tories as Churchill and 
Eden, even if Labour were returned with a majority, has been completely 
rejected by the workers and even sections of the lower middle class.</p>
<p>In the middle of the election, 
because of the hostile reception accorded by the working class to such 
treacherous ideas of capitulation to the capitalists and their Parties, 
the Stalinists were forced to abandon it and adopt in its stead the 
demagogic slogan of a &ldquo;Labour and Communist Government&rdquo;! Had 
the Tories gained a narrow majority, the Stalinists would have pressed 
this policy of Popular Frontism, as they were already doing in the big 
Unions, such as the N.U.R. and Miners Union which passed resolutions 
demanding unity of the &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; forces at the next General 
Election. At the last Labour Party Conference a resolution to discuss 
this question was only narrowly defeated. Now, by their action at the 
polls, the masses have decisively rejected this policy. Not even the 
Stalinists have dared to revive their Popular Frontism since the election 
results were announced.</p>
<p>The Stalinists suffered serious 
blows. The reasons: partly because of their support for Churchill and 
the Liberals; partly because the masses did not see any sense in splitting 
the vote when the C.P. programme was similar to that of the Labour Party, 
except that it was more right wing. Their change of front in the middle 
of the election did not save them. The Stalinists lost 13 deposits out 
of 21 candidates, succeeded in electing 2 M.P.s only, and polled well 
in only a few constituencies. So well known a figure as R. Palme Dutt 
polled 1,850 votes. Their total vote was a little over 100,000.</p>
<p>The I.L.P. campaign was confused. 
They put up only 5 candidates&mdash;the lowest number since the last war. 
With difficulty, they succeeded in retaining their three Glasgow seats 
with lower majorities.</p>
<p>In Bilston, they were snowed 
under, receiving only 890 votes. And even in East Bradford, their votes 
dropped to half of what they had been in the previous election. This 
could be expected as it would have been difficult for the Labour voters 
to see any difference in the policy put forward by the I.L.P. and that 
of the Labour Party.</p>
<p>The Common Wealth has been 
virtually wiped out; most of their candidates where they opposed the 
Labour Party losing their deposits, and only one being returned where 
there was no Labour candidate.</p>
<p>The election of a Labour Government 
with a majority is a tremendous step forward for the working class. 
Had the Labour leaders made a bold stirring appeal which would have 
electrified the electorate, the votes received by Labour would have 
been enormously increased. As it is, over the capitalist Parties together, 
the working class vote is only a bare majority.</p>
<p>But real measures against the 
capitalists and in the interests of the masses, would convince the bulk 
of those backward workers and the middle class who voted for Churchill 
and the capitalist parties.</p>
<p>The workers in the various 
Labour Parties, factories, Co-ops and the other mass organisations of 
the working class must demand that the Labour leaders should carry out 
their promises.</p>
<p>Immediately, the Labour Government 
must order the requisitioning of all empty houses and have a census 
made of the space in the houses and hotels of the rich. After a reasonable 
amount of space is left for the capitalists and their families, (the 
average rooms in which workers and their families are expected to live) 
homeless families and those hard pressed for proper shelter should be 
billeted upon them. This measure would at least relieve the housing 
shortage.</p>
<p>The Labour Government must 
introduce measures on the lines outlined is the programme put forward 
in the <i>Socialist Appeal</i>. A committee composed of delegates elected 
in the factories and technicians from the different industries, should 
be set up to investigate the resources of the country and plan production 
so as to ensure high standards of living for all. Control of these industries 
would have to be in the hands of the workers&rsquo; committees to ensure 
decent wages and conditions for all.</p>
<p>Any attempt by the capitalists 
to close their factories and thus produce mass unemployment during the 
re-conversion programme, must be answered by the confiscation of these 
factories and their taking over by the Government, to be run under the 
control of committees which should be elected by the workers employed 
in such plants.</p>
<p>All war factories closed down 
because of lack of work must be reopened and run in the above manner 
and converted to the production of goods needed by the workers.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the 
nationalisation of the mines, steel industries and other industries, 
as promised in the Labour programme, the workers must be appealed to 
in order to set up committees to run these industries under the control 
of the miners, steelworkers, engineers, etc.</p>
<p>Among the first measures which 
the Labour leaders must introduce, is an Act repealing all anti-working 
class legislation, especially the Trade Disputes Act of 1927.</p>
<p>The last Labour Party Conference 
overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling for equal gratuities for 
all ranks in the forces. This pledge must be speedily implemented by 
the Labour Government.</p>
<p>The Labour leaders have pledged 
themselves to support the Imperialist war against Japan. The workers 
must demand that their husbands, sweethearts, sons and brothers should 
be brought home. The arming of the Indian and Chinese people would supply 
more than enough forces to achieve the liberation of Asia from the shackles 
of Japanese Imperialism. The power of the Mikado and of the Japanese 
militarists could be broken by a genuine liberation of the peoples of 
Asia from the exploitation of all imperialisms, and by appealing to 
the Japanese workers and farmers on the basis of a declaration of freedom 
for the Eastern peoples.</p>
<p>As it is, the Labour Government 
will be helping to get back oil, tin, rubber and other materials, plus 
strategic bases for the plunder and exploitation of the peoples of the 
Pacific in the interests of the British capitalists. Such a policy would 
be entirely against the interests of the British workers.</p>
<p>In relation to Europe, the 
Labour Government should restore freedom to the German people, now that 
Hitler is gone, and aid them to take action against the German capitalists 
and landlords.</p>
<p>Bring the boys home from Germany 
and restore them to their wives and families and let them help in the 
reconstruction of Britain. To the workers of Europe the Labour Government 
should offer a genuine Socialist union in a Socialist United States 
of Europe.</p>
<p>Immediately the result was 
announced, Harold Laski, Chairman of the Labour Party, declared that 
the Labour Government would not aid reaction in Europe. Discredited 
kings and monarchs, and fascist dictators such as Franco, could not 
expect support from the Labour Government. It would support the peoples 
against the reactionaries. The workers must take the Labour leaders 
at their word. Laski said this in the first exuberance of victory. But 
obviously, this is the elementary duty of any government claiming to 
represent socialism. The workers must demand through their organisations, 
an immediate break with the butcher Franco. No truck with fascist gangsters 
and monarchists&mdash;such as the King of Italy and Greece, stained as 
deeply as Hitler and Mussolini, with the crimes of fascism. No support 
to quisling reactionary regimes such as that of Vulgaris and Damaskinos 
in Greece! Full support to the peoples in their struggle for free elections 
and a government of their own choice.</p>
<p>Obviously, any real measures 
in the interests of the workers will meet with the determined sabotage 
of Big Business. Already Wall Street is openly preparing to exert pressure 
on the Labour Government according to reports in the capitalist press. 
No less bitter will be the sabotage of British Big Business.</p>
<p>The reply of the Labour Government 
must be to seize control of all the Banks and financial Houses.</p>
<p>Any attempt at obstruction 
by the House of Lords or the monarchy must be replied to by an instant 
appeal to the polls on the issue of the abolition of these feudal survivals.</p>
<p>A bold programme of deeds and 
not words would gain the enthusiasm and strong support of the workers 
nationally and internationally. The ruling class has no sure basis of 
support on which to lean against a Labour Government carrying out such 
a programme. To appeal to the Army (80 to 90 per cent Labour!) would 
be fantastic. A few generals and officers could do nothing. Even the 
rank and file policemen would not lift a finger in the interests of 
the capitalists.</p>
<p>How much and how easily could 
the whole social structure in Britain and Europe be changed by a bold 
Socialist programme on the part of the Labour leaders!</p>
<p>The mood of the advanced workers 
is one of jubilation at getting rid of the Tories, but one of watchful 
waiting and scepticism at the ability of the Labour leaders to deliver 
the goods!</p>
<p>The attitude of big sections 
of workers in the advanced areas in Labour strongholds of many years 
is &ldquo;Give them a chance&mdash;but no excuses this time! They&rsquo;ve got 
everything they asked for in a big majority!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This thoughtful mood of the 
workers is an indication of the tremendous advance in mass consciousness 
in the last 25 years. The workers mean business. They want improvements 
and they intend to get them. But already Big Business is confidently 
calculating on utilising the Labour leaders against the workers!</p>
<p>The <i>Daily Mail</i>, rabid 
and bitter organ of reaction, in its editorial of 30<sup>th</sup> July, cynically 
remarks:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;A large majority 
implies great expectations on the part of the people. They will certainly 
look for a vigorous exposition of what the Government intend to do, 
especially in the realm of social reform&hellip;</p>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Little has been heard 
of nationalisation since the election results were declared, but this 
economic experiment is still the main plank in the Socialists&rsquo; programme. 
The time has come when they must abandon generalities and get down to 
details.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Whether the Government 
will succeed in nationalising all the industries they have named remains 
to be seen. It is a lot to do in five years, even if there were no other 
problems.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;But there will be plenty. 
The strike of the locomotive engineers which has stranded holiday-makers 
at the Kentish seaside resorts is a small but sharp reminder of the 
troubles ahead.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Foreign policy, home affairs, 
and economics will present the Labour Government with a series of hard 
and unalterable facts. They will find that &pound;.s.d. are not meaningless 
symbols, and that the change-over from war-time to peace-time wage scales 
will be no more popular because it comes from a Labour Government. They 
begin their great tasks with general good-will and not a little curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is really a veiled threat 
on the part of reaction, in spite of smooth words, to cover the preparations 
of the boss class offensive against the workers, and to utilise the 
situation to discredit the idea of Socialism.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, that there 
is a basis of fact in the attitude adopted by Big Business in the editorial 
quoted above, is shown by the report of a discussion between Bevin and 
a Swedish Trade Union Leader quoted in the <i>Daily Express </i>
of July 28<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>In an article ironically headed, 
&ldquo;The Problem&rdquo;, it says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Mr. Charles Lindley, 
Swedish trade unionist said today: &lsquo;When I spoke to Bevin at the Blackpool 
congress he rather doubted a Socialist victory.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;He said: &lsquo;Even if we win 
we shall have hard times before us. To convert industry to peace production 
with lower wages as a result will be an enormous problem.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no reason to doubt 
the authenticity of this report. Bevin has not denied it! All the more 
reason, therefore, for vigilance and watchfulness by the rank and file 
of the movement. But that many sections of the working class realise 
this already, is shown by the movement of the railwaymen and dockers. 
They want action, and action in <i>their</i> interests <i>against</i> 
the bosses.</p>
<p>The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of July 30th reports:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Officials of the 
railway trade unions were howled down when they appealed to 1,000 &lsquo;Sunday 
strikers&rsquo; at Liverpool yesterday to abandon their threat of a Bank Holiday 
strike&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delegates at both meetings 
called for nationalisation of the railways.</p>
<p>At Liverpool, a Birkenhead 
representative declared:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;If we continue our 
present action the new Government will be able to turn to the companies 
and tell them they cannot manage their business. It would then be an 
easy step towards nationalisation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sensing the mood and the determination 
of the railway workers, Binks, the president of the National Union of 
Railwaymen openly threatened national action and proclaimed at the very 
dawn of the new Government:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Before our new Government 
can nationalise the railways it must first give them back to the companies 
that own them and then do what it says, it is going to do. Until then 
it is the companies we have to deal with.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;But although we now have 
a Government of our own liking and choosing it may be in the future&mdash;time will
tell&mdash;that we of the trade unions will have to fight 
them to get what we want as we fought the Government in the past.&rdquo; 
(Reported in the <i>Daily Express</i> of July 30<sup>th</sup> 1945.)</p>
<p>The need for pressure to obtain 
the demands of the workers could not be expressed better than in the 
latter part of Binks&rsquo; statement. Coming from one of the top leaders 
of the Unions it obtains added weight. But the railwaymen will expect 
deeds as well as words from him too.</p>
<p>The workers must exert pressure 
in an organised fashion. Committees should be set up composed of delegates 
from the unions, factories, housewives, Co-ops, even small shop-keepers 
and middle class people in the localities, to push forward the demands 
of the masses and to exert mass pressure against any attempt of the 
capitalists to sabotage or disrupt measures under-taken by the Labour 
Government,</p>
<p>Real assistance and moral support 
could be given to the Labour leaders if they introduced measures in 
the interests of the workers. Perhaps the trades councils, extended 
and broadened to embrace other sections of the population, could fulfil 
this function.</p>
<p>The R.C.P. declares to the workers. 
We fought with all the forces at our disposal to help put Labour into 
Power. The workers have achieved this wonderful advance. But again we 
warn you, you can rely only on your own organisations, strength and 
solidarity to achieve any real gains. We will fight side by side with 
you now to insist, and endeavour to ensure, that the Labour leaders 
take adequate action against capitalism and in the interests of the 
workers, and to watch carefully all the manoeuvres and intrigues of 
Big Business against the Labour Government.</p>

  <p>No excuses!</p>
  <p>Actions against 
  capitalism! Put into force a Socialist programme in the interests of 
  the masses!</p>
  <p>Watch the intrigues 
  of Big Business!</p>
  <p>Form Committees 
  to help and exert pressure on the Labour Government!</p>
