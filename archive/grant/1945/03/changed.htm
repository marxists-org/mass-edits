<p class="fst">The end of the war opens out a new stage of the military, diplomatic, economic 
  and political developments of the world.</p>


<p>The overwhelming economic and military preponderance of the Soviet Union in 
  the East, and of American imperialism with her British satellite in the West, 
  has finally resulted in the reduction of German and Japanese imperialism to 
  dust.</p>


<p>Following in the wake of the victorious 'allied' armies, the 'big three' with 
  their foreign secretaries and advisers meet, discuss, and arrive at secret diplomatic 
  agreements to partition Europe and the world into spheres of influence and zones 
  of exploitation. The satellite states are invited into the councils of the United 
  Nations, but only to create a facade and lend weight to the decisions arrived 
  at by the hard bargaining behind the scenes on the part of the big three.</p>


<p>Overshadowing the military and diplomatic arrangements, however, is the fear 
  of proletarian revolution in Germany and in Europe as a whole; and not only 
  in Europe but in the colonial areas of the East. This cardinal problem, which 
  again and again raises itself for a forceful solution, is rapidly becoming the 
  main preoccupation of the three big powers. Indeed, the cardinal point in the 
  alliance which now cements the 'big three' together, and will do so in the future, 
  is this fear of revolution and the preoccupation with the plans for staving 
  off, or repressing the inevitable revolutionary upheavals in Germany and Europe 
  which will seek to destroy the old capitalist order.</p>


<p>The changed relationship of forces between the world powers since the Treaty 
  of Versailles, hidden in their gradual transformation between the two world 
  wars, is now clearly demonstrated in the military fortunes of the nations.</p>


<p>The destruction of the French army, once the mightiest military force in Europe; 
  the disintegration of the French empire; the miserable role of the ruling class 
  in France during the nazi occupation as Quislings of the conqueror; all these 
  have served to underline the decline of France from the status of a great power 
  to the role of a third rate power in Europe and the world.</p>


<p>The bubble of empire pretensions, widely advertised by the Italian ruling class 
  through their strutting black-shirted legions, has been pricked and shattered. 
  The weak and insufficient economic base, incapable of the slightest strain, 
  cracked at the first test. Italy is reduced to the role of a Balkan country.</p>


<p>Both in the East of Europe and the West, the war has entirely altered the importance 
  of the nations in the new alignment of forces. Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Baltic 
  and Balkan countries, Belgium, Holland, and the Scandinavian lands - all these 
  have a lesser weight and role to play in the 'councils of the nations'.</p>


<p>The collapse of British hegemony of the globe; the inability of Britain to 
  maintain her position on the continent of Europe or to intervene decisively 
  in the military struggles; the subordination of her military leaders on the 
  continent of Europe to those of her Yankee patrons; and her general decline 
  in relation to her Russo-American allies is rapidly placing Britain in her real 
  relationship to the other powers - the 'biggest of the small nations'.</p>



<p>The entry into the world arena of American imperialism with her gigantic economic 
  and military resources, has immediately placed her far in the forefront of the 
  imperialist nations. Both in the East and in the West, the weight of the economic 
  and military forces assures her of a dominant position. The Pacific is fast 
  becoming an 'American lake', while the British dominions gravitate towards the 
  dollar and remain only nominally tied to the motherland.</p>


<h4>The Emergence of Russia From The War</h4>

<p><em>But by far the greatest event of world significance is the emergence of 
  Russia, for the first time in history, as the Greatest military power in Europe 
  and Asia. </em>The tremendous victories of the Red Army in Europe have forced 
  the majority of the European bourgeoisie to orientate themselves towards the 
  Kremlin; whilst the pro-Soviet movement on the part of the masses, has created 
  a powerful basis of support.</p>


<p><em>In Europe today there is no continental power left which can effect a challenge 
  to the Red Army. </em>Nor is it possible to create in a few years a military 
  force capable, materially and morally, of undertaking such a challenge. Only 
  on the basis of a complete defeat for the European working class, the total 
  destruction of its organisations and the introduction of a Yankee black reaction, 
  would it be possible to regroup the forces of European capitalism for an anti-Russian 
  assault.</p>


<p>The weariness of the masses in all countries, especially in Europe, the admiration 
  and support for the Red Army, the sympathy and warm support for the Soviet Union 
  among broad sections of the working class even in the United States - all these 
  factors taken together with the relation of military forces, make it extremely 
  difficult, if not entirely impossible for the Allies to launch an attack on 
  the Soviet Union in the immediate post-war years.</p>


<p>The risks of such an operation are far too great in their political implications, 
  not only in Europe or Asia where the masses would support the Soviet Union, 
  but in Britain and America. Ideologically it would not be possible to mobilise 
  the masses for such a war which would tend to expose the whole nature of the 
  previous struggle against the Axis<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup>. Moreover, such a war would be inevitably protracted because 
  of the military might of the Soviet Union, thus ushering in revolutionary explosions 
  throughout the globe. For the next period, despite the antagonisms, the Allies 
  will be forced to tolerate a deal with the Soviet Union.</p>


<h4>The Plans of the Imperialists Went Wrong</h4>

<p>German imperialism confidently anticipated the destruction and disintegration 
  of the Soviet state; the Anglo-American imperialists expected and hoped for 
  the downfall of the Soviet Union, but wished to use Russia simultaneously to 
  break the power of German imperialism, leaving them the victors. They expected 
  at least that the Soviet Union would emerge broken and weakened decisively and 
  thus be unable to resist the demands and impositions they planned to impose 
  upon her.</p>


<p>But their calculations went wrong. An outstanding result of the imperialist 
  war is the definitive emergence of the Soviet Union from a backward state, to 
  the greatest military power on the continent of Europe. This has upset all the 
  calculations of the imperialists of both camps. The results have induced a cold 
  sweat in all the chancelleries of the world.</p>


<p>The war in Europe in great part resolved itself into a war between Germany, 
  armed with the resources of the whole of Europe, and the Soviet Union. And from 
  this decisive test Russia has emerged victorious.</p>


<p>The Stalinist bureaucracy has a two-fold purpose in occupying the countries 
  of Eastern Europe: a strategic defence position against its allies; and the 
  domination, plunder and enslavement of the Balkan and Central European peoples 
  in the interests of the bureaucracy itself. However, the entrance of the Red 
  Army into Eastern Europe provoked a movement among wide strata of the oppressed 
  workers and peasants. The Stalinist bureaucracy has utilised this movement in 
  order to place their puppets firmly in control of the governments. Meanwhile, 
  in order to placate his allies, Stalin has retained capitalism in the areas 
  under his control which have not been incorporated into the Soviet Union, while 
  making concessions in land reforms to the peasants.</p>


<p>Another reason for the retention of capitalism in the occupied areas lies in 
  the fear of the bureaucracy of the inevitable repercussions of setting in motion 
  the forces of the proletarian revolution, even in caricature form in the Balkans 
  and throughout the continent of Europe. The highly explosive situation would 
  mean the spreading of the movement beyond the control of the bureaucracy and 
  would threaten to have tremendous repercussions on the Red Army and the workers 
  and peasants of the Soviet Union.</p>


<p>Thus, the occupation of Germany and Eastern Europe serves, for the bureaucracy, 
  a dual purpose. It aims at defending the Soviet Union by methods which serve 
  the reactionary aims and needs of the Stalinist bureaucracy. Such methods have 
  nothing in common with, in fact are the negation of Leninism. In relation to 
  the European revolution the Soviet occupation is intended for the purpose of 
  strangling and destroying the revolution of the proletariat.</p>


<p>With the fall of German imperialism the defence of the Soviet Union, which 
  formerly assumed the first importance in the tasks of the proletariat of the 
  Soviet Union in relation to the war, now gives place to the defence of the European 
  revolution against the Soviet bureaucracy. The Red Army is used as a weapon 
  of counter-revolution in the hands of the Bonapartist bureaucracy. For the European 
  proletariat the counter-revolutionary policy of the Stalinist bureaucracy assumes 
  the form of a mortal danger.</p>


<p>Nevertheless, the situation is fraught with mortal danger to the Stalinist 
  bureaucracy. Inevitably the Red Army workers and peasants will fraternise with 
  the workers and peasants of the conquered countries. The soldiers will see the 
  complete falsity of the propaganda of the bureaucracy as to conditions in other 
  countries compared with those in Russia.</p>


<p>In general it can be said that in the coming period <em>either </em>the retention 
  of capitalism in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe occupied by the 
  USSR will serve as a starting point for the restoration of capitalism within 
  the Soviet Union itself by providing the bureaucracy with the opportunity of 
  acquiring the ownership of the means of production; or the bureaucracy will 
  be forced, against its own wishes and at the risk of antagonising its present 
  imperialist allies, to nationalise industry in the permanently occupied countries, 
  acting from above and, if possible, without the participation of the masses.</p>


<p>The Fourth International, while explaining the nature of the Soviet Union and 
  the necessity of its defence from world imperialism, will expose the counter-revolutionary 
  role of the bureaucracy in relation to the European and world revolution. At 
  the next stage the main task in the defence of the Soviet Union lies in the 
  defence of the European revolution against the conspiracy of the Stalinist bureaucracy 
  with world imperialism. Where the Red Army, which remains under the control 
  of the bureaucracy as an instrument of its policy, is used to crush and destroy 
  the movement of the masses towards revolution, or in the supression of workers' 
  uprisings and insurrections, the Fourth International will call on the workers 
  to oppose the Red Army with all the means in their power, including strikes, 
  armed force, etc, while appealing to the Red Army soldiers to remember the mission 
  of October and come over to the side of the working class. The defence of the 
  Soviet Union can best be served by an extension of October, and the revival 
  of soviet democracy within the Soviet Union.</p>


<p>The Great Russian Stalinist bureaucracy stifles the national aspirations of 
  the national minorities within the Soviet Union. While subordinating the struggle 
  for independence to the defence of the Soviet Union, the Revolutionary Communist 
  Party stands for the <em>right </em>of the Ukrainian, Baltic and other Soviet 
  minorities to secede from the Stalinist Soviet Union and form independent socialist 
  states. But the secession is a reactionary utopia unless it is conceived of 
  as part of a struggle for soviet democracy, the overthrow of Stalinism, and 
  for the unification of the democratised USSR with the United Socialist States 
  of Europe.</p>


<p>During the course of the war the separation of the bureaucratic caste from 
  the masses and its elevation above them, has received tremendous impetus. Nothing 
  remains of the gains of October except the basic conquest: nationalised property. 
  Power has passed from the hands of the civil bureaucracy to the military bureaucracy 
  with the galaxy of marshals at its head. Contradictory processes are taking 
  place in the Soviet Union. On the one hand the course of the war has accelerated 
  the proletarianisation of new strata of the population, of women and even children. 
  Thus, the Soviet proletariat today cannot be far short of the number of proletarians 
  in the United States. On the other hand, the differentiation between the bureaucracy 
  and the masses, assumes more and more a capitalist character. Thus, two opposite 
  tendencies are revealed. The capitalist tendencies look more and more to the 
  capitalist West, the vices of which the Soviet bureaucracy has completely assimilated. 
  The Soviet masses are well aware of the crimes of the bureaucracy, of whom they 
  have an intense hatred. The victorious workers, peasants and soldiers will present 
  their account to the Soviet bureaucracy on the morrow. The victories of the 
  Red Army cannot but have imbued the Soviet masses with a tremendous elan and 
  self-confidence. They will not so easily acccept the impositions and excuses 
  of the bureaucracy once the danger from capitalist intervention has declined. 
  The war and the Herculean struggle have thrust the mass of the population out 
  of their despair and apathy. The war has been the means of revolutionising Soviet 
  society no less than that in capitalist countries.</p>


<p>The victories of the Soviet Union are a capital for the world revolution, both 
  in the effects on the masses in Europe and the world, as well as in their preservation 
  of nationalised economy. But it is necessary for the working classes to understand 
  the dual, contradictory process.</p>


<p>On the one hand the victories of the Red Army arouse echoes of the October 
  revolution in the European masses; on the other hand the bureaucracy uses the 
  Red Army and its agencies - the Communist Parties - for the purposes of strangling 
  the proletarian revolution.</p>


<p>From a purely economic point of view, even with bureaucratic excesses and the 
  stifling of the initiative of the masses, the Soviet Union will probably be 
  in a position to restore production within a few years, to the level achieved 
  before the war. Further economic successes could he maintained, but that is 
  not to say that the war has not had profound effects upon Soviet economic life, 
  or that post-war economic developments in the Soviet Union will take place smoothly 
  and without crises. During the past four years the whole economy has been adapted 
  to an almost exclusive production of war equipment. The remarkable productive 
  results which have been obtained, have been won only at great cost - the wearing 
  out of machinery, the elimination of consumers' industries, the physical exhaustion 
  of the workers. Consequently in the future, we can expect sharp crises arising 
  out of the disproportions inside the Soviet economy; crises such as occurred 
  in the pre-war years and which no amount of 'planning' by the bureaucracy can 
  overcome, since they are basically due to the fact that the nationalised economy 
  of the Soviet Union is an isolated and not a world economy.</p>


<p>The already existing disproportions between the various branches of Soviet 
  economy, between light and heavy industry, between industry and agriculture, 
  have all been greatly accentuated as a result of the war. In particular the 
  position of agriculture, which had even by 1941 not yet completely recovered 
  from the ravages of the period of forced collectivisation and which has been 
  largely devastated by the present war, will pose problems not capable of final 
  solution within the framework of the isolated economy of the Soviet Union.</p>


<p>But nevertheless, the advantages of the nationalised economy are such, that 
  despite those economic contradictions, and within their framework, great productive 
  achievements are possible upon a scale and at a speed far beyond the powers 
  of even the most advanced capitalist states.</p>


<p>The differentiation within the Soviet Union has reached such proportions that 
  the perspectives resolve themselves into three possibilities:</p>


<ol class="numbered">
  <li> It is theoretically not excluded that on the basis of an ascending economy, 
  the bureaucracy could maintain itself for a further period of years;</li>
  <li> The further degeneration of the Soviet bureaucracy would prepare the way 
  for capitalist restoration;</li>
  <li> The proletarian resurgence would result in the overthrow of the bureaucracy 
  and the restoration of Soviet democracy.</li>
</ol>

<p>The bourgeoisie of the world, and above all Anglo-American imperialism, is 
  staking everything on the internal degeneration taking place within the Soviet 
  Union. Through economic pressure from without and the reaction within, they 
  are hoping to restore capitalism in the USSR. On the basis of the victory of 
  the reaction in Europe and Asia, they hope eventually to restore capitalism, 
  if necessary by military means. Meanwhile, despite sharp clashes, they are compelled 
  to defer the settlement of this account and to utilise the services of the Kremlin 
  to strangle the revolution, which directly and immediately threatens the very 
  existence of capitalism in Europe and Asia. Thus the bourgeoisie utilise the 
  services of the bureaucracy today in the hour of mortal danger of capitalism, 
  in order to strangle the Soviet Union when the crisis has been surmounted.</p>


<p>But despite the proportions to which the bureaucracy has grown, the situation 
  presents favourable factors for the resuscitation of workers' power. The economic 
  conquests are in contradiction with the stranglehold of the bureaucracy, which 
  becomes an increasing burden on the economy of the country. The power of the 
  traditions of October, even overlaid as it is with the bureaucratic filth, has 
  been shown in the war. Coming events will reveal many surprises for the world 
  bourgeoisie as well as for the Stalinist bureaucracy. Collective ownership, 
  which has revealed its superiority in peace as in war, now finds itself in sharper 
  conflict with the bureaucracy. It will be in the <em>political crisis </em>which 
  the aftermath of the war will bring, that the full weakness of the bureaucracy 
  will be shown. Collisions between the workers and peasants, between the soldiers 
  demanding the fruits of victory and the usurpers, are inevitable. It is in these 
  clashes that the mighty Soviet proletariat, and its vanguard the Fourth Internationalists, 
  with its tradition of three revolutions and two victorious wars, will find itself 
  once again.</p>


<h4>The National Question in Europe</h4>

<p>Despite the ease with which the nazi war machine overran all Europe, but a 
  few years were needed to reveal that the conquest was illusory. The nazis were 
  incapable of holding down the suffering peoples for whom the conquest meant 
  intensified poverty and famine, on top of the insufferable burden of a totalitarian 
  alien yoke. Without a clear class programme as the basis of their struggle, 
  and at the cost of innumerable victims, the masses still succeeded in undermining 
  the nazi domination of Europe.</p>


<p>The ruling class of the conquered countries, willingly or unwillingly, joined 
  hands with the nazi overlords and became managers and junior partners of the 
  conquerors. The champions of 'national dignity' and 'national unity' in the 
  hour of defeat, united with the oppressor against the mass of their own nation. 
  Class interests, like water, find their own level.</p>


<p>If the nazis succeeded with the aid of Quislings, backed by the SS with its 
  torture and terror, in maintaining a precarious hold for a time, this was due 
  to the assistance rendered them by the policies of social democracy and Stalinism. 
  The appeal to national chauvinism could not but aid the German imperialists 
  to draw the German worker and peasant behind them in the 'struggle between the 
  races'; it could not but act as a national cement for the nazi gangsters and 
  the German bourgeoisie. Faced with the choice between national enslavement of 
  others, or themselves becoming nationally enslaved, the German soldiers continued 
  to act as forces of occupation, no doubt with bitterness in their hearts. An 
  internationalist socialist appeal from the mass illegal organisations of the 
  working class, or from the leadership of the Soviet Union, and a systematic 
  campaign of class fraternisation would have echoed, and had results in the far 
  corners of the German Reich and nazi empire. But such an appeal was never made. 
  Systematic class fraternisation and action was never organised.</p>


<h4>Our Attitude to the Resistance Movements</h4>

<p>Organised resistance to the foreign oppressor was initiated by the Stalinists, 
  social democrats, petty bourgeois parties and sections of the bourgeoisie. Within 
  the heterogeneous groups which formed the resistance, the class contradictions 
  and antagonisms found sharp and organised expression, and in some countries 
  came to the point of civil war.</p>


<p>In Poland, Yugoslavia and in Greece, the sharp division resulted in dual and 
  rival movements of resistance. Zervas<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup> and EDES were 
  representative of the old feudal capitalist reaction, who at certain stages 
  even rested upon the nazis as against Tito and Siantos, who in turn represented 
  the plebian masses. To a lesser extent, this same division was to be found in 
  all the occupied countries; as in France, with the Maquis and the FTP.</p>


<p>In the clashes and armed struggles which took place from time to time, the 
  'left' wing, or elements of the resistance resting directly on the revolutionary 
  sections of the people, were forced under the pressure of class antagonisms 
  into collisions with the elements representing the bourgeoisie. Despite the 
  'national', non-class policy of betrayal by the leadership, the movement represented 
  the strivings and pressure of the masses for a class solution, thus, the revolutionary 
  socialists were duty bound to give critical support to the left wing against 
  the right.</p>


<p>But even the left wing of the resistance movement was not based on broad committees, 
  but on an agreement of the parties. As such it was a bloc of parties, and particularly 
  in face of the Quisling role of the bulk of the bourgeoisie, it was a caricature 
  of the popular front. Despite the support of thousands of loyal proletarian 
  fighters, who saw in these left sections of the resistance movement an answer 
  to their class aspirations, the chauvinist petty bourgeois programme, leadership 
  and activity of the resistance bloc, characterised it as a direct agency of 
  imperialism.</p>


<p>In the midst of the imperialist war, all the objective conditions are such 
  that a genuine struggle for national liberation and a break-up of the alliance 
  with imperialism, could only have been undertaken on the basis of a socialist 
  programme, under the slogan of the Socialist United States of Europe. Organised 
  struggle on any other basis, on the policy of both wings of the resistance was 
  to aid one bloc of imperialists in the midst of the war.</p>


<p>The Trotskyists, therefore, could not dip their banner by entering into the 
  bloc of parties and support this caricature popular front. Whilst supporting 
  and where possible, giving leadership to every real move of the masses: strikes, 
  demonstrations, and armed clashes, the Trotskyists had the duty to denounce 
  the resistance bloc as such, and its leadership as an arm and agency of Anglo-American 
  imperialism, hostile to the class interests of the working class.</p>


<p>In opposition to the military formations of the bourgeois and petty bourgeois-inspired 
  resistance movement the proletarian party has the duty to counterpose, and wherever 
  possible, to organise independent military formations of the working class as 
  well as its own independent military formations.</p>


<p>Implacable hostility to the 'resistance bloc' is supplemented by flexible tactics 
  in the operation of party policy. The organisations of the resistance were important 
  fields for revolutionary activity. The revolutionary party had the duty to send 
  its cadres into the resistance movements counterposing a proletarian to a bourgeois 
  and petty bourgeois programme, helping to destroy the influence of the bourgeoisie 
  over militant sections of the working class, and organising a conscious proletarian 
  opposition to the policy of chauvinism and the chauvinistic leaders.</p>


<p>The 'liberation' of the continent by Anglo-American imperialism posed the problem 
  of the class struggle in an acute form. With the lifting of the heavy hand of 
  totalitarian suppression by German imperialism, the national question tended 
  to be thrust into the background. Only a prolonged military occupation over 
  a period of years by the forces of Anglo-American imperialism and of the Stalinist 
  bureaucracy, could raise the national question to an important place in the 
  politics of the European continent. The indirect oppression and exploitation 
  by the big three powers, the military intervention on the side of the old ruling 
  class against the proletariat would tend rather to raise the <em>class issues 
  </em>in the consciousness of the European peoples. It is in the case of Germany 
  that the national problem will assume an acute character with the dismemberment 
  and subjugation of Germany by the Allies.</p>


<h4>Classic Conditions for the Proletarian Revolution</h4>

<p>The majority of the European bourgeoisie, which has already been badly shaken 
  by the great mass movements of a few years preceding the outbreak of the war, 
  proved incapable of leading the nations which they had summoned to the 'defence 
  of the fatherland'. Further demoralised by the military defeat, without perspective, 
  and filled with hatred for their own working class, almost the entire ruling 
  class of the conquered countries fraternised with the enemy and organised the 
  joint exploitation together with the foreign oppressor, of the mass of their 
  own nation. Thus, as Quislings they earned the hatred of the overwhelming mass 
  of the workers and petty bourgeoisie.</p>


<p>The victory of the Allies now finds the bourgeoisie seeking to play the same 
  role for the 'liberators' as they did for the 'conquerors'. Without stable organs 
  of state oppression, panic-stricken in the face of the mounting wrath of the 
  masses, demoralised and without that confidence which is essential to an exploiting 
  ruling class, they are completely dependent on allied bayonets for the continuation 
  of their rule.</p>


<p>At the other pole, the mass of the working class no longer wants the old regime. 
  The experience of a generation of capitalist rule since the last world war, 
  plus a demonstration of the role of their own ruling class under the nazi occupation; 
  unemployment and starvation, fascism and national humiliation; the recognition 
  that whilst the masses carried the struggle against the foreign oppressor, the 
  ruling class collaborated and enriched themselves; and finally, the gigantic 
  victories of the Red Army with all its associations with the October revolution 
  - all these factors have resulted in a transformation of the outlook of the 
  working masses.</p>


<p>The workers of Europe are breaking with bourgeois parliamentary politics and 
  social democratic reformism and are turning to revolutionary politics and communism 
  - unfortunately at this stage to the Stalinist parties, its caricatured and 
  distorted form.</p>


<p>Total war and the defeat accelerated the concentration of capital and the ruination 
  of the middle class especially in the towns. In their hundreds and thousands 
  the petty bourgeoisie has been rudely pushed down into the ranks of the workers. 
  They have been forced into the factories and slave labour camps; they have been 
  proletarianised. On the background of working class radicalisation a corresponding 
  change has taken place within the ranks of the petty bourgeoisie.</p>


<p>As always, the most oppressed strata of the population - the women and the 
  youth - have had to bear the greatest burdens of the war, and here too, particularly 
  among the youth the desire for a radical change and a communist solution of 
  the problems of the day has taken a firm hold.</p>


<p>Thus all the <em>objective </em>conditions for the overthrow of capitalism and 
  the introduction of socialism are clearly in existence. But the <em>subjective 
  </em>factors are not yet established. The mass revolutionary parties of the Fourth 
  International have not yet been created. To transform the small Trotskyist groups 
  and parties into the fighting leadership of the working class is the most important 
  question facing our comrades in Europe. Without mass Trotskyist parties the 
  masses, blindfolded by social democracy and particularly by Stalinism will batter 
  their heads in vain against the ramparts of capitalism.</p>


<p>Only the numerical weakness of the cadres of the Fourth International and the 
  isolation of our comrades, gives the ruling class the possibility of a breathing 
  space. The leadership of the bourgeoisie is aware of its own class needs, despite 
  its demoralisation. They must at all costs crush the working class; but they 
  lack the forces to do so at the moment.</p>


<h4>The Experience of Greece</h4>

<p>The events in Greece<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">(3)</a></sup> marked the beginning of a new 
  phase of revolution and counter-revolution within Europe. In this tiny country, 
  where the explosive force of centuries of class antagonism has accumulated and 
  which has been in turmoil for three decades, civil war broke out and was followed 
  by a ruthless and brutal <em>war of intervention</em> by the British imperialists.</p>


<p>In the conflict between royalists and republicans during the past generation, 
  the bourgeoisie, incapable of taking decisive action against the feudal landlords, 
  were equally incapable of solving the problems of the democratic revolution 
  and invariably paved the way for monarchist reaction. The restoration of King 
  George<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-4" name="doc-4">(4)</a></sup> was followed by the dictatorship of Metaxas in 
  an endeavour to restore 'tranquility' and class 'peace'. This 'experiment' was 
  aimed at atomising the Greek working class and peasant movement which threatened 
  to upset the old regime and move in the direction of socialist revolution - 
  as indicated by the strikes of the workers and revolts of sections of the peasantry. 
  The British imperialists, whose financial and strategic interests forced them 
  to regard Greece as a sub-colony, assisted the Greek ruling class in carrying 
  out this reactionary move.</p>


<p>The viciousness of the Metaxas dictatorship had already undermined the basis 
  of the Greek ruling class and created a popular movement of revolt before the 
  war. But the collaboration of the Greek ruling class with the German conqueror 
  as Quislings crystallised the hostility of the masses and thus generated the 
  explosion once the German troops had been withdrawn.</p>


<p>The attempt to foist the old ruling class and even the monarchy upon the masses 
  was not to be tolerated without a struggle. The masses, who had fought a ruthless 
  and bloody war against the SS had been largely responsible for the liberation 
  of Greece. <em>De facto </em>control was in their hands through the armed organisation, 
  ELAS. Thus, the provocation of the Greek government police in firing on unarmed 
  demonstrators was sufficient to precipitate the armed uprising. Without preparation, 
  organisation, or a clear idea of how to achieve their aims, the valiant Greek 
  proletariat and peasantry went into action. But due to the lack of a revolutionary 
  leadership, the struggle was defeated.</p>


<p>The Stalinist leadership diverted the movement into safe channels on the familiar 
  pattern of the peoples' front, and the movement's social aims were placed in 
  the straight jacket of bourgeois parliamentarism. Thus the ground was laid for 
  defeat and capitulation on the part of the Stalinist leadership.</p>


<p>Once again, the Greek events demonstrated that without a revolutionary party 
  the masses will be led to disaster especially when the class struggle leads 
  to open civil war. Without the party the masses cannot achieve the conquest 
  of power.</p>


<p>However, leaving aside the local peculiarities, Greece represented in itself 
  a model of the problems and lessons for all Europe. Churchill's policy of unrelenting 
  repression was dictated by considerations of imperialist strategy as much as 
  by internal class relationships. With the Stalinist bureaucracy dominant throughout 
  the Balkans by the occupation of the victorious Red Army, it was essential for 
  Britain's imperialist interests in the Mediterranean to have a firm hold over 
  Greece. Even so, in Greece, the imperialists have received an object lesson 
  on the difficulties of an open policy of military repression in Europe. The 
  most sober and realistic section of the ruling class in Britain was opposed 
  throughout to the blundering, adventuristic policy of repression of Churchill. 
  Even in a small country of six million inhabitants, the dangers of such a course 
  of action were revealed by the development of events. British imperialism was 
  compelled to compromise with the petty bourgeois traitors in the leadership 
  of EAM.</p>


<p>The Plastiras<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-5" name="doc-5">(5)</a></sup> government and its successor the Vulgaris 
  government represent an uneasy attempt to restore the equilibrium of bourgeois 
  society in Greece. Elements of Bonapartism and military dictatorship are undoubtedly 
  present in this set-up. Nevertheless, the compromise arrrived at with the capitulation 
  of the Stalinist leadership, in however attenuated a form (due to the struggle 
  of the masses and the uneasiness of the British proletariat), has left the masses 
  with their organisations, though not completely intact, still far from being 
  destroyed.</p>


<p>This uneasy balance of forces cannot last indefinitely. Either the monarchy 
  will be restored which would inevitably lead to a systematic extermination of 
  the organisations of the proletariat, or the reaction might still feel itself 
  too weak and attempt to manoeuvre with a republic. Even with the latter, however, 
  the present regime could not last long. An impulsion from below would inevitably 
  sweep it aside and the bourgeoisie would attempt to manipulate the political 
  scene again through its popular front agencies. However, developments in Greece 
  will depend to a great extent on events in Western Europe, the Balkans and Britain. 
  Only one thing is predetermined: for the next period the regime in Greece will 
  go through one crisis after another.</p>


<h4>The Counter-Revolution in a 'Democratic' Form</h4>

<p>Greece has revealed the heat lightning of the revolutionary storm gathering 
  in Europe. The bourgeoisie of the entire world has assessed these events in 
  correct perspective. The basis of the old system has broken down throughout 
  the whole of ruined Europe. <em>The disappearance of Hitler and Mussolini means 
  the end of a stable basis for reaction </em>in Europe, at least for the next 
  immediate period.</p>


<p>Under conditions of ferment and radicalisation of the masses, with the rebelliousness 
  of the masses turning directly on the road of insurrection; with the thrice-ruined 
  petty bourgeoisie turning away in hatred and disgust against the combines and 
  monopolies, from the influence of capitalist reaction, the task of Anglo-American 
  imperialism to restore 'order' to Europe, to establish the rule of capital, 
  assumes the shape of complicated and dexterous manoeuvres. To bludgeon the masses 
  will be difficult at this stage and it will be necessary to deceive them with 
  the panaceas of 'progress', 'reforms', 'democracy', as against the horrors of 
  totalitarian rule. In Europe, however, control of the situation has largely 
  slipped out of the hands of the bourgeoisie. It is the mass organisations of 
  the working class which will have the decisive say.</p>


<p>With the fall of Mussolini, the instant appearance of soviet forms of organisation 
  organised by sections of the workers, soldiers and peasants marked the appearance 
  of the proletariat once more on the political arena. Here too, dual power in 
  its elementary stages was immediately apparent. But once again, the main hindrance 
  and drag on the development of the revolution has been the policy of the old 
  workers' parties. The consciousness of the masses is still at an elementary 
  stage; they do not want capitalism and the old regime and have aspirations to 
  follow the example of the Russian workers in the October revolution. But as 
  yet they do not understand the role of the old workers' parties as brakes on 
  the development of the struggle; as yet they do not understand the need for 
  a mass Trotskyist party.</p>


<p>The whole of Western Europe presents a picture of revolutionary crises in their 
  embryonic stages. The lifting of the heavy hand of totalitarian suppression 
  revealed the forces that have been developing beneath the surface. In Belgium, 
  Holland and even Scandinavia the same process of mass resistance to the oppression 
  and the estrangement from the emigre cliques of the old 'governments' is plainly 
  seen.</p>


<p>Eastern Europe presents a similar picture of the development of the molecular 
  process of the revolution. The heroic insurrection of the Warsaw workers<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-6" name="doc-6">(6)</a></sup> 
  at the approach of the Red Army even though distorted and misled by the London 
  Committee, is indicative of the mood of the masses of Poland. The calculated 
  betrayal of Warsaw by the Stalinist bureaucracy underlined the counter-revolutionary 
  role which it played in Europe and the world.</p>


<p>It would be true to say that faced with mass revolutionary parties of the working 
  class in Europe, the position of the bourgeoisie would be hopeless. But given 
  the weakness of the revolutionary vanguard, as Lenin explained, there is no 
  hopeless position for the bourgeoisie. Social democracy saved capitalism after 
  the last war. Today there are two traitor 'internationals' at the service of 
  capital - Stalinism and social democracy. They, together with the leadership 
  of the trade union organisations which sprung up once again immediately the 
  pressure of the nazis was lifted, offer themselves as hirelings of capital.</p>


<p>The SS found it an impossible task to control Europe. After their experience, 
  the bourgeoisie realises the impossibility of controlling the masses by similar 
  means at this stage of reawakening. They find a ready and willing tool in the 
  shape of the social democratic and Stalinist organisations to dam the revolutionary 
  upsurge of the masses into safe and harmless channels of class collaboration 
  through an even more degenerate form of popular frontism than existed in the 
  past. Thus, they will combine repressions with illusory reforms. Smashing the 
  embryo organs of workers' rule and disarming the masses, while simultaneously 
  proclaiming their desire for 'representative' government and 'democratic' liberties. 
  There is no other way whereby they can curb the upsurge of the masses towards 
  the overthrow of the capitalist system. True, the counter-revolution of capital 
  in its early stages, will, within a short period of time following the establishment 
  of military government, assume a 'democratic' form. The bourgeoisie will combine 
  the granting of illusory concessions with reprisals and repressions against 
  the revolutionary forces.</p>


<p><em>The approaching revolution in Europe can be no other than the proletarian 
  revolution. </em>However, in its early stages it is inevitable that the old organisations 
  of the proletariat should succeed in placing themselves at the head of the masses. 
  The masses will learn only through a new experience, however brief, that these 
  organisations represent the interests of the class enemy. And while absolutely 
  clear on <em>what they do not want, </em>the masses are not clear about the means 
  by which to achieve their ends. <em>Thus, all the factors make for a period of 
  Kerenskyism</em><sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-7" name="doc-7">(7)</a></sup><em> in the first stages of the revolution 
  in Europe</em>.</p>


<p>Anglo-American imperialism perceives the inevitability of the fall of Franco 
  and with it revolutionary disturbances throughout the Iberian Peninsula once 
  Hitler has disappeared from the scene. With the discontent of the masses increasing, 
  Anglo-American imperialism is already negotiating and manoeuvring with sections 
  of the Spanish bourgeoisie, with Franco and with emigre politicians for the 
  purpose of heading off the revolutionary insurrection of the masses. An insurrection 
  in Spain threatens to have too serious effects in the rest of Europe. Hence 
  their search for a Spanish Badoglio<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-8" name="doc-8">(8)</a></sup> to ensure a 'safe' and 'peaceful' transition from the doomed 
  Franco regime. Whether their efforts are successful or not, the movement of 
  the masses can only be temporarily delayed thereby. However, the serious representatives 
  of finance-capital have learned far more from the experiences of the past decades 
  than the perfidious 'leaders' of the working class. To them the problem of transition 
  from one regime to another is determined by how best the interests of the ruling 
  class can be served and safeguarded.</p>


<p>It is clearly impossible for the bourgeoisie of Britain and America to impose 
  an alien totalitarian yoke on the peoples of Europe for any length of time. 
  Especially important in this connection is the role of the Kremlin. While deadly 
  afraid of the victory of the proletarian revolution, the Kremlin is interested 
  in preserving, wherever possible, the maximum freedom of movement for their 
  agencies, the local Communist Parties. The victory of reaction throughout Europe 
  spells a new and greater danger of imperialist intervention against the Soviet 
  Union on a continental scale. Thus, the policy of the Soviet bureaucracy is 
  that of ensuring <em>the rule of capital, but with the existence of the workers' 
  movement as a safeguard against the bourgeoisie. </em>The broad mass of the peoples 
  of Europe look towards the Soviet Union as the banner-bearer of socialism. The 
  capitalist democracies for the present, are compelled to reconcile themselves 
  to this factor, and on the basis of the preservation of capitalism in Europe, 
  are willing - and indeed have no other choice - than to compromise with the 
  Soviet bureaucracy.</p>


<p>The experience of the Russian revolution, of the German Revolution of 1918, 
  of the Spanish revolution of 1931, all reinforce these conclusions. The upsurge 
  of the masses led to the fall of the monarchy in Spain and the proclamation 
  of the Republic by the bourgeoisie. A coalition government of bourgeois republicans 
  and socialists proclaimed radical programmes on paper, while conducting repressions 
  against workers and peasants. Such a government could not be long lasting. The 
  regime of the Spanish republic was a regime of crises. A period of ebbs and 
  flows, of reaction and radicalisation, culminating finally in half a decade 
  in the bourgeoisie and proletariat attempting to find a solution in sanguinary 
  and desperate civil war.</p>


<p>The Spanish pattern of events will be manifested on an all European scale in 
  the coming period. Backward as well as advanced countries are faced, in some 
  degree or other, with the same crisis. From the Volga to the North Sea, from 
  the Black Sea to the Baltic, nearly all Europe has been reduced to ruins and 
  chaos. A stable basis for bourgeois democracy is thus excluded. Even the relative 
  'stability' of the Spanish republic will not be achieved. The most revolutionary 
  period in European history is heralded by the events in Italy and Greece.</p>


<h4>The Allied Programme for Europe</h4>

<p>The Allied programme for Europe, because of the deeper crisis of capitalism, 
  is far more terrible in its provisions than even the Versailles Treaty. Instead 
  of the forcible unity of one gigantic concentration camp which was the aim of 
  the nazis, the Allies wish to atomise and split up Europe on the lines which 
  so signally led to catastrophe after the last war. Europe is to become the prey 
  of British and American imperialism, with sections of Europe as satellites of 
  and within the sphere of the Soviet bureaucracy.</p>


<p>Even under capitalist auspices, a united Europe would loom as too formidable 
  a rival and threat for British and American imperialism. The Soviet bureacracy 
  is unalterably opposed to the prospect of the unification of even part of the 
  continent in capitalist federations, because it would inevitably become the 
  basis for a new war against the Soviet Union in the future. Hence Stalin, together 
  with Truman<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-9" name="doc-9">(9)</a></sup> and Churchill, is committed to the Balkanisation 
  of Europe and the dismemberment of Germany as the only possible formidable foe 
  in a future war on the continent of Europe.</p>


<p>American imperialism with its huge resources and productive capacity, is driven 
  to attempt the 'organisation' of the entire world in an endeavour to escape 
  the consequences of the insoluble contradictions between the capacities and 
  limitations of even the great American market. America seeks to usurp the age-old 
  dominance of Europe - above all of decaying and enfeebled British imperialism 
  - and to grab the markets of the entire world. Not satisfied with the markets 
  of the colonial countries, America wishes to establish a stranglehold on the 
  markets and industries of Europe as well. She wants the dollar to reign over 
  the currencies and economy of Europe. Taking advantage of the chaos and disorganisation 
  of Europe caused by the war, American finance capital hopes to put Europe on 
  rations by means of loans and the weapon of food, supplies and equipment, while 
  simultaneously at moments of stress and turmoil, blackmailing and buying off 
  the revolutions by the same means.</p>


<p>The savagery of Anglo-American imperialism in relation to Germany is dictated 
  not only by the programme of subjugation and exploitation, but by fear of the 
  proletarian revolution in Germany. The German people have had the experience 
  of all the regimes of bourgeois rule within a few decades. The proletariat and 
  the petty bourgeoisie will inevitably turn in the direction of the socialist 
  revolution.</p>


<p>It is in Germany that the bourgeoisie will discover the utopian character of 
  their schemes to retain the old system. All attempts to punish fraternisation 
  will collapse with the occupation of Germany for any length of time. The Tommies<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-10" name="doc-10">(10)</a></sup> and the Doughboys will consider their mission in Europe 
  completed. They will demand demobilisation and a return home to the better world 
  promised them by the bourgeoisie. The struggle of the German proletariat against 
  the occupation forces, against the national humiliation and dismemberment of 
  Germany, the struggle for national and social freedom, will prepare the way, 
  under the very heel of the occupying forces, for a tremendous resistance on 
  the part of the masses.</p>


<p>With their reactionary programme of national enslavement, the Stalinists can 
  hope to bamboozle the German masses for only the briefest of periods. The way 
  is being prepared for a rapid regroupment of forces of the German proletariat 
  in a revolutionary direction. The experience of Italy is an object lesson on 
  how quickly the masses can recover from the effects of terrible defeats under 
  the impact of historic events. The resources and capacity for struggle of the 
  proletariat seem virtually inexhaustible.</p>


<p>The Balkanisation of Germany and Europe, the Anglo-American domination of Western 
  Europe, the claims of France, the domination of Eastern Europe by the Kremlin 
  through bourgeois puppets, will have even more frightful consequences than the 
  'peace' of Versailles on the tortured continent. In the epoch of aeroplanes 
  and panzer divisions, the absurdity of national frontiers, customs barriers 
  and armies, of small and large states in Europe, assumes a particularly baleful 
  character for the slow and painful strangulation of the productive forces and 
  the decline of European culture. Particularly as the great powers - included 
  among which are none of the European powers, for the first time - will bleed 
  all Europe for their own ends. The next stage will become the classic period 
  of the epoch of wars, revolutions and counter-revolutions, deepened and intensified 
  by the history of the past decades.</p>


<p>It is possible, on the basis of the support rendered to world imperialism by 
  Stalinism and classical reformism (and this is one of the objective factors 
  to be reckoned with) that world imperialism can succeed, for a period, in 'stabilising' 
  bourgeois democratic regimes in certain countries. Stalinism must offer the 
  masses some gains in the shape of restoration of the trade unions, free (relatively, 
  as in Spain in 1931) press, speech, voting, etc, in however attenuated a form. 
  The imperialists need a 'democratic' interlude before taking the road of reaction. 
  Moreover, they have no other choice. The shocks of the war and the debacle of 
  fascism <em>leave no mass basis for reaction </em>in the immediate 
  period ahead. The attempt to set up military dictatorships without social support 
  would be very difficult. Moreover, such regimes could not survive for very long 
  once the British and American troops were compelled to withdraw. The stormy 
  impulsion of the masses compels them to bring forward their reserve weapon in 
  the shape of the labour organisations.</p>


<p>It is possible, on the other hand, that in isolated instances the Anglo-American 
  imperialists and the national bourgeoisie will succeed in immediately introducing 
  military dictatorships. But without a social basis among the masses, these could 
  not be long enduring. On the background of European and world social unrest 
  and clashes such regimes would be faced with crises and convulsions.</p>


<p>Our estimate of the development of events does not mean that we draw pessimistic 
  conclusions. Rather the contrary. But it does demand that the Fourth International 
  utilise the situation in order to prepare for the shocks that await the imperialists. 
  Ours is an epoch of sharp turns. The changes in the situation in Spain following 
  the revolution of 1931<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-11" name="doc-11">(11)</a></sup> developed with tremendous rapidity: 
  upsurge of the masses, sell-out of the reformists, incapacity of the anarcho-syndicalists 
  and Stalinists to give a revolutionary lead (particularly on the democratic 
  and transitional demands). The short period of lull in which reaction prepared 
  its forces to settle with the masses on the basis of disillusionment and despair 
  engendered by their leadership; the masses respond to the whip of the counter-revolution 
  by general strike and insurrection in Asturias and Catalonia; the reaction is 
  unable to consolidate itself; the masses revive, the formation of the People's 
  Front as a bridle for the masses; the February elections; stormy movements of 
  the workers and peasants which the Stalinists and reformists are unable to control; 
  a movement in the direction of the socialist revolution; the July coup of Franco 
  and the answering insurrection of the masses.</p>


<p>Here we have a glimpse of the next period in Europe. The cadres of the Fourth 
  International must study with great care the lessons of these events. To each 
  stage correspond different slogans and tactics, different methods of agitation 
  and propaganda, different actions on the part of the masses.</p>


<p>On this background of crises which extends more or less over the entire continent, 
  spreading across the archaic national boundaries, the objective conditions are 
  created for the establishment of a Socialist United States of Europe as the 
  only solution to the problems which rack every country.</p>


<p>The implications of the war, the struggle of the peoples against Nazi domination, 
  the example of the federation of the USSR, the coming reaction against the Allied 
  domination, the inevitable reaction against nationalist intoxication and chauvinism, 
  the radicalisation of the European masses - all these factors supply also the 
  subjective basis for propaganda for the Socialist United States of Europe to 
  which the masses will respond. As the cord which binds the programme of the 
  Fourth International together, the main strategic slogan will be the United 
  Socialist States of Europe as the only alternative to national decay and disintegration, 
  decline of culture and civilisation in all the countries of Europe.</p>


<h4>Our Tasks in Europe</h4>

<p>The Fourth International will penetrate the broad masses and build the party 
  of socialist revolution only with a correct tactical approach to the changing 
  situations and moods.</p>


<p>It would require <em>a whole series of terrible defeats </em>before the bourgeoisie 
  could establish an open dictatorial rule on the lines of the fascist regimes 
  of Hitler and Mussolini. The cycle begins all over again, but on a new basis. 
  The decay of the capitalist system weakens the bourgeoisie and renders it less 
  capable of firmly riveting its rule on the masses. It is 1917-21 with which 
  the world is faced - but on a higher level. The degeneracy of the rotted workers' 
  organisations gives capitalism a breathing space. <em>Only if the series 
  of revolutions fails </em>can the bourgeoisie hope to save its system once again 
  by resorting to a neo-fascism of monstrous reaction and repression. Before then 
  the masses will have been put to the test. The proletariat will discard its 
  old organisations if the Fourth international in its strategy and tactics is 
  capable of integrating itself with the mass movement of the workers.</p>


<p>The basic task in this period is the building of the mass revolutionary parties 
  of the Fourth International. While striving for and advocating the setting up 
  of <em>ad hoc </em>organisations of struggle wherever the opportunity arises, 
  while struggling for and advocating the dictatorship of the proletariat as the 
  only solution, our European comrades cannot hope to achieve this in the first 
  stages of the struggle. True, the masses are seeking the socialist solution; 
  but they will have to go through the experience in action of the policy of betrayal 
  of Stalinism and social democracy in order to learn that even the old standards 
  of life can be obtained only by the rule of the working class.</p>


<p><em>The struggle for democratic, economic and transitional demands, far from
being superceded or obsolete during the course of the revolutionary epoch 
  ahead, assumes tremendous importance for the building of the framework of our 
  movement</em>. Thus, side by side with the propaganda for soviets and workers' 
  government, at this stage there must be waged an agitation for the old organisations 
  of the workers which still maintain the confidence and support of the masses, 
  to break their alliance with the decadent bourgeoisie and Allied imperialism, 
  and for the leaders to match their words with deeds. Our comrades will demand 
  that the mass organisations which claim to represent the workers, wage a struggle 
  to take power into their own hands. 'A Government of Socialists and Communists!' 
  This will be the rallying cry which will be utilised by the Fourth International 
  to mobilise the social democratic and communist workers to wage a struggle against 
  the capitalist class.</p>


<p>Together, and side by side with this, must go the demand for general elections 
  on the basis of universal suffrage from the age of eighteen years. The bourgeoisie 
  and the reformist organisations are prattling about democratic rights, but they 
  have allowed power to remain in the hands of bourgeois cliques, for the most 
  part under the protection of Allied bayonets, without consulting the masses 
  or receiving a mandate from them. Thus, the demand for a general election and 
  the convening of a constituent assembly must play a great role in the agitation 
  of our comrades in the first stages of the revolutionary mobilisation of the 
  masses. Together with these will be linked the transitional slogans in various 
  industries at varying stages of the struggle: Nationalise the banks without 
  compensation! Take over the mines, railways and big combines and industry, and 
  operate them under workers' control! Expropriate the trusts which yesterday 
  collaborated with Hitler and today collaborate with the Allied imperialists! 
  A plan of public works! A sliding scale of hours and wages! The arming of the 
  workers and the organising of workers' militias! There is no need to detail 
  all the demands which will be put forward, according to the development of the 
  situation as laid down in the policy of the Fourth International in its Transitional 
  Programme. These demands are not in contradiction with the programme of soviets, 
  of workers' committees in the factories and streets. But without them there 
  is a danger that the groups of the Fourth International would degenerate into 
  sectarian sterility and isolation. They represent a bridge to the broad masses 
  and without them the problem of organising the vanguard is rendered doubly difficult.</p>


<p>It is in periods such as this that the party of the Fourth International will 
  build itself. The Stalinist and social democratic parties will not attain the 
  stability they achieved in the pre-war era. They will be faced with a constant 
  series of crises and splits. Given correct tactics the parties of the Fourth 
  International will grow at their expense. However, ephemeral, centrist currents 
  and groupings are bound to make their appearance in many countries owing to 
  the weakness of the organisations of the Fourth International and their lack 
  of authoritative spokesmen, such as Leon Trotsky. Authority will be built up 
  on the basis of the ability of the young cadres of the International to learn 
  for themselves in the course of the struggles, and on the basis of the masses' 
  experience of the application of the programme of the Fourth International.</p>
