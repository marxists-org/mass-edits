In the August issue of <em>Workers&#8217;
International News </em>an article was published on the nature of the regimes in
Europe <sup class="ednote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup>. In dealing with the arguments of Comrade Pierre Frank as to
whether bourgeois democratic or Bonapartist regimes had been established in Western Europe, the following point was made:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Comrade Frank says the existence of democratic liberties
does not suffice to make a democratic regime. A profound observation! What
follows? The existence of Bonapartist measures does not make a regime
Bonapartist either, Comrade Frank! This argument is about as profound <em>as
those of the </em>&#8216;bureaucratic collectivists&#8217; <em>who argued </em>that we had the
intervention of the state in the economy in Germany under Hitler, in France
under Blum, in America under Roosevelt (NRA), in Russia under
Stalin&#8230;consequently all those regimes were the same. It is not the
points of similarity only&#8212;all human societies have points of similarity,
particularly different types of capitalist societies&#8212;it is the <em>decisive
traits </em>which determine our definition of regimes.&#8221; (My emphasis&#8212;E. G.)
</p>
<p class="fst">
To anyone reading
the article conscientiously, it should be clear that this analogy is there to
elucidate the point that repressive measures do not necessarily convert a
regime into a Bonapartist dictatorship. However, <em>The New International</em>
of October 1946 contains an article by M. S. <sup class="ednote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup> which asserts that this point was introduced for the
sinister purpose of distorting the views of that school of &#8220;bureaucratic
collectivists&#8221; gathered around Max Shachtman. M. S. writes:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;By &#8216;bureaucratic collectivists&#8217; Grant can but have in mind
the comrades of the Workers&#8217; Party and <em>The New International</em> who have put forward
and defended the theory that Stalinist Russia represents what we call a
&#8216;bureaucratic collectivist state.&#8217;
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;&#8230;According to Grant, the &#8216;bureaucratic collectivists&#8217; <em>argue
</em>(where they do this arguing remains a secret not only to us but also, to
Grant) that the Roosevelt, Hitler, Blum and Stalin regimes are all the same;
but again according to Grant&#8212;and this time with a sarcasm guaranteed, as the
English say, to hit us for six&#8212;this argument is not very profound.&#8221; (My
emphasis&#8212;E. G.)
</p>
<p class="fst">
We call your readers&#8217; attention to
the quotation of M. S. in the second paragraph. He has changed the tense. The
article reads: <em>&#8220;those of the bureaucratic collectivists who argued&#8221;; </em>Shachtman changes it to <em>&#8220;the
bureaucratic collectivists argue.&#8221;</em>
</p>
<p>
If we used the
polemical method of Shachtman we would ask him, in his own language, which
category of readers does he fall into: those who read and misrepresent or those
who read and do not understand?
</p>
<p>
The significance
of this change will be apparent in a moment. It should be noted that the
article in dispute referred to <em>&#8220;those of the </em>bureaucratic
collectivists,&#8221; not specifically to <em>all the bureaucratic collectivists, </em>of
which there are varying schools. M. S. has thus not only changed the tense, but
the very essence of the sentence. It is rather a curious method for one so
righteous in his plea for scrupulousness in criticism and polemic.
</p>
<p>
Shachtman imagines
that he is the only minnow in the pond. He forgets that there were many
forerunners. We will let him into the &#8220;secret&#8221; as to which of the bureaucratic
collectivists we [were] referring to.
</p>
<p>
In the discussion
which Trotsky had with Burnham in 1940, long before M. S. had branched out on
his own version of &#8220;bureaucratic collectivism,&#8221; Trotsky wrote:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Recently, an Italian &#8216;left communist,&#8217; Bruno R., who
formerly adhered to the Fourth International, came to the conclusion that
&#8220;bureaucratic collectivism&#8221; was about to replace capitalism&#8230; Bruno R. brackets
together planned economy in the USSR,
fascism, National Socialism, and Roosevelt&#8217;s
&#8216;New Deal.&#8217; All these regimes undoubtedly possess common traits, which in the
last analysis are determined by the collectivist tendencies of modern economy&#8230;
The traits of centralization and collectivization determine both the politics of
revolution and the politics of counter-revolution; but this by no means
signifies that it is possible to equate revolution, Thermidor, fascism and
American &#8216;reformism&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
If we decide to
discuss Shachtman&#8217;s particular &#8220;bureaucratic collectivist&#8221; tendency, we will
discuss it for the ideas it represents, and not other ideas. If it will give
solace to M. S., we hereby declare that his particular tendency was not
referred to in the above reference. Had he read the passage scrupulously, this
would have been clear to him before he embarked on his irresponsible outburst
in &#8220;Setting the Record Straight.&#8221;

<h3>Reply to Grant</h3>
<p class="fst">
Comrade Grant charges me
with a failure to read his article conscientiously, with changing not only the
tense but the very essence of an important sentence in his article and with an
irresponsible outburst. In reply, I hasten to plead guilty to the charge of
changing the tense&#8212;but to no other. I think, however, there is ground for a
very merciful sentence. Grant spoke of the bureaucratic collectivists who <em>&#8220;argued.&#8221;
</em>Paraphrasing him, I spoke of bureaucratic collectivists who <em>&#8220;argue.&#8221; </em>I
would put my neck under the knife&#8212;reluctantly, of course, but with the
knowledge that I was getting no less than my due&#8212;only if it could be pointed
out that by having changed the tense I somehow did violence to &#8220;the very
essence of the sentence.&#8221; To point this out it is only necessary for Grant to
do one thing: to show that the &#8220;bureaucratic collectivists&#8221;&#8212;no matter who they
are, no matter what &#8220;school&#8221; they belong to, no matter which minnow Grant had
in mind&#8212;<em>used to have </em>the views that Grant rejects but <em>no longer </em>have
them today, that is, who &#8220;argued&#8221; but no longer &#8220;argue.&#8221; I doubt very much if
Grant will be able to find any such bureaucratic collectivist minnow. In any
case, I have never seen one and I do not know of its existence.
</p>
<p>
Grant says that
the word &#8220;those&#8221; in the sentence in dispute referred not to the word &#8220;argument&#8221;
but to the term &#8220;bureaucratic collectivists.&#8221; As I read it then and as I read
it now, &#8220;those&#8221; refers to the kind of arguments made by the bureaucratic
collectivists. It appears that I am in error; I cheerfully acknowledge it.
According to Comrade Grant, the sentence should be construed as meaning the
argument made, so to speak, by those particular bureaucratic collectivists who
argue (pardon, argued!) that &#8220;all those regimes were the same.&#8221; I do not want
to lose myself in a discussion over syntax, which is a field in which I readily
yield to Grant. But in spite of what he writes, I am compelled again to ask the
question: In referring to &#8220;bureaucratic collectivists,&#8221; to whom could Grant
possibly have referred if not to the comrades of the Workers&#8217; Party?
</p>
<p>
Perhaps to Burnham and
his followers?
But Burnham does not even speak of bureaucratic collectivism and, so far as we
understand his viewpoint, he does not contend that the regimes of Hitlerite
Germany, Blum&#8217;s France,
Roosevelt&#8217;s America
and Stalinist Russia are (were) &#8220;the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Perhaps to MacDonald and those who agree with
him, since they do use the term bureaucratic collectivism? But if we understand
MacDonald&#8217;s view in this question (or in any other) he &#8220;argued&#8221; very
emphatically that while the Stalinist and Hitlerite regimes &#8220;were the same,&#8221;
they were, by virtue of their non-capitalist and anti-capitalist nature,
fundamentally different from those of Roosevelt and Blum.
</p>
<p>
It is then neither the Burnhamite nor the
MacDonaldites who could be meant. And in order to give solace to M. S., Grant
declares that our &#8220;particular tendency was not referred to&#8221; either.
</p>
<h4>The Mysterious Bruno R.</h4>
<p class="fst">
Who, then? He lets us into the &#8220;secret&#8221; without
hesitation. He was referring&#8212;it is perfectly plain to see&#8212;to Bruno R. The
unfindable, unquotable, more or less incorporeal and altogether mysterious
Bruno R. is materialized before our very eyes as &#8220;those of the bureaucratic
collectivists.&#8221; Good. I will not say another word about Bruno&#8217;s pluralization <em>(def.,
</em>the act of pluralizing; the attributing of plurality to a person by the use
of a plural pronoun. <em>Webster). </em>But if we do not have to defend ourselves
because we were not meant, our unknown and unfindable fellow minnow ought to
get at least some defense.
</p>
<p>
Whether Bruno believed
that &#8220;consequently all those regimes were the same&#8221; or believed something quite
different, we do not begin to profess to know. But our ignorance on this point
is no greater than Grant&#8217;s, or than the ignorance of anyone else we know of,
except for Trotsky himself. With that exception, no one we know of has read
Bruno&#8217;s work; no one has quoted one single sentence from it; no one has so much
as seen a copy of the book (if it is a book and not an unpublished manuscript,
as is possible). All that Grant or we or anyone we ever heard of knows about the
views of Bruno R. is what Trotsky wrote about him in 1939 in <em>In Defense of
Marxism. </em>But not even Trotsky&#8217;s paraphrase of Bruno&#8217;s views gives one the
right to attribute to this mysterious writer the opinion that the regimes in
the four countries mentioned &#8220;were the same.&#8221; Trotsky writes, for example, that
Bruno R. places both the Soviet and fascist regimes under the category of
&#8216;bureaucratic collectivism,&#8217; because the U.S.S.R., Italy
and Germany
are all ruled by bureaucracies...&#8221; <em>(op. cit., </em>p. 52). He writes
that Bruno &#8220;came to the conclusion that &#8216;bureaucratic collectivism&#8217; was about
to <em>replace </em>capitalism&#8221; <em>(op. cit., </em>p. 10. My emphasis) and that
Bruno &#8220;brackets together planned economy in the USSR,
fascism, National Socialism and Roosevelt&#8217;s
&#8216;New Deal&#8217;.&#8221; (same page). But while these rather skimpy descriptions may permit
all sorts of conclusions as to Bruno&#8217;s views as he actually elaborated them in
his work, they give us, I repeat, no right to conclude that Bruno held all
these regimes to be the same.
</p>
<p>
In general, people
concerned with scrupulousness and conscientiousness and methods which are not
curious, might do well in theoretical and political discussion to refrain from
categorical expressions of opinions about views which they have not read, which
they cannot read, which are not available to anyone for examination and
verification. The observance of this rule will help us all confine our offenses
to harmless tense changing, and nothing worse than that.
</p>
<p>
Comrade Grant notifies us that &#8220;if we decide to
discuss Shachtman&#8217;s particular &#8216;bureaucratic collectivist&#8217; tendency, we would
discuss it for the ideas it represents and not other ideas.&#8221; I will not add to
my already numerous offenses by asking why it has taken so long to &#8220;decide&#8221; or
what stands in the way of this decision. In the ranks of the Fourth
International the supporters of bureaucratic collectivism are, to our
knowledge, confined to those who agree substantially with the viewpoint of the
Workers&#8217; Party. Whatever pond the other minnows may swim in, it is not in the
ranks of the Fourth International. With appropriate modesty we suggest that it
is time to decide in favor of an open discussion of our views on the &#8220;Russian
question.&#8221; Along with Grant, we suggest that &#8220;if&#8221; it is decided to discuss our
position, it will be discussed &#8220;for the ideas it represents and not other
ideas.&#8221; Up to now, we have not had very much luck in this respect. Comrade
Grant&#8217;s promise encourages us to hope for the best.
