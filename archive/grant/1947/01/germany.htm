<p class="fst">The comrades of the IKD (a section of the German Emigre Trotskyists) have replied 
  to our criticism<sup><a href="../../1945/10/character.htm">[source]</a></sup> of their <em>Three Theses </em><sup><a href="../../../../history/etol/newspape/fi/vol03/no12/3theses.htm">[source]</a></sup>
in an article entitled <em>Two Balance Sheets </em>published in October 1946 <em>Workers' International News</em>.</p>


<p>While ostensibly correcting certain errors, viz: their claim that 'the national 
  oppression has remained, only the uniforms of the oppressors have changed', 
  they reinforce their fundamental revision which is contained in the assertion 
  that what we are faced with in Europe was not, and apparently is not, the proletarian 
  revolution, but wars of national liberation and a revolution '<em>basically equivalent 
  to a democratic revolution</em>'. Ignoring the fundamental issue, the class character 
  of the revolution, they jeeringly reiterate that the proletarian revolution, 
  which had been confidently anticipated by the Fourth International, has not 
  materialised.</p>


<p>True, it has not materialised. And an instructive discussion can and must be 
  conducted as to the reasons for the failure of the proletariat to take power 
  in the first revolutionary wave following World War II. But this does not invalidate 
  the orthodox Marxist attitude towards the class struggle in Europe today any 
  less than did the similar failure of the proletariat to conquer power anywhere 
  in the world apart from Russia after World War I. Lenin and Trotsky explained 
  this failure by the treachery of the Second International, of social democracy.</p>


<p>Today, the masses are deceived by two traitor 'internationals', the reformist 
  and the Stalinist - with the latter being far more formidable owing to the authority 
  usurped from the October revolution, having a base far stronger than that ever 
  possessed by social democracy. This factor places exceptional difficulties in 
  the path of the proletariat. The Stalinists have for the moment successfully 
  switched the movement of the masses away from the proletarian revolution into 
  the channels of the 'people's revolution', ie into the channels of bourgeois 
  democracy, as did the social democrats after the last war.</p>


<p>Our German comrades of the IKD should remember the experience of Weimar. Had 
  any sneering petit-bourgeois sceptic reproached Lenin and Trotsky, say in 1920, 
  asking where was the promised revolution in Europe, they would have received 
  a fitting but hardly polite reply. Our answer cannot be any different. The basic 
  thesis of the IKD, which our comrades maintain without any real attempt at defence 
  against criticism, is that capitalist 'retrogression' makes necessary in Europe 
  a detour through what they define as <em>'basically equivalent to a democratic 
  revolution'.</em></p>


<p>For the basis of this, let us quote again the original <em>Three Theses:</em></p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The prisons, the new ghettos, the forced labour, the concentration and 
  even war prisoners' camps are not only transitional political-military establishments, 
  they are just as much forms of new economic exploitation which accompanies the 
  development toward a modern slave state and is intended as the permanent fate 
  of a considerable percentage of modern mankind.&quot;<sup><a href="../../../../history/etol/newspape/fi/vol03/no12/3theses.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>


<p class="fst">This impressionistic evaluation, written at the height of the war, is being 
  refuted by events.</p>


<p>This capitalist 'retrogression' theory is further developed on the basis of 
  the temporary springing up of small factories during the war as evidence of 
  a return to the 'slave state', the middle ages, and the dawn of capitalism. 
  Temporary features caused by the needs of the war are transformed into permanent 
  features of the present epoch. Thrown overboard is the Marxist theory of the 
  concentration of big industry at the expense of small, of the replacement of 
  handiwork by machinery, the development of the 'free' labourer as against the 
  serf and slave labourer of the past.</p>


<p>The political wisdom of the comrades of the IKD is summed up thus:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;In contrast to the use of complicated machinery, and in contrast to the 
  concentration and over-development of an industry fit only for war purposes, 
  there is compulsory labour, that is the mass use of manual labour which is cheaper 
  than machine labour, the founding and extension of small and middle-sized forms 
  because of the shortage of consumer goods, the restoration of handwork, the 
  dissipation and ruin of the monetary system...The political situation in these 
  systematically exploited countries (under nazi domination) is characterised 
  above all by the destruction of workers' and non-fascist bourgeois parties.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Step by step unions, political and cultural societies of all kinds, religious 
  organisations, etc, are wiped out according to the German pattern, changed or 
  in some way put under direct fascist control. With certain exceptions, where 
  this process has not yet been fully complete, there is no longer an independent 
  traditional bourgeois or proletarian political or workers' movement, and in 
  these countries (especially in Poland and Czechoslovakia) even the 'national' 
  bourgeois is being more and more crushed by such means as 'aryanisation', compulsory 
  sales and direct expulsion.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;All that is left of the old organised 'movements' are today nothing but 
  illegal circles which have little connection with each other and can in no way 
  act as an entity...As it is pushed to that limit which is daily drawn closer 
  by this enemy, it levels all and everything and takes a direction which can 
  be described as nothing but a 'drive for national freedom'. In a few countries 
  (Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, in part Poland, etc.) this drive has crossed the 
  limit and has turned into a real people's movement. In it participate all classes 
  and strata from workers, farm labourers, farmers, urban petit bourgeoisie (tradesmen 
  and artisans, that is, together with the farmers, those classes, which in spite 
  of their large numbers are remnants of pre-capitalistic modes of production) 
  to officials, priests, intellectuals and generals.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;If in the Europe dominated by Germany there is no longer an organised 
  and active workers' movement and even the bourgeois organisations are out of 
  the picture, there can also be no talk of the existence of real revolutionary 
  organisations, in so far as they are understood as united structures which, 
  even if illegal, would be willing and capable of influencing the development 
  by means at least of correct agitation and propaganda...However one views it, 
  the transition from fascism to socialism remains a utopia without an intermediate 
  stage, which is <em>basically </em>equivalent to a democratic revolution.&quot; 
  <em>(Three Theses)</em> <sup><a href="../../../../history/etol/newspape/fi/vol03/no12/3theses.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>


<p class="fst">With small changes, Dimitrov<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup> and Stalin could have subscribed to such an analysis. So 
  the workers' movement is still non-existent! On the contrary, the labour movement 
  in Western Europe, far from having been destroyed, has come out of the war stronger 
  than it entered it. True, the supporters of the <em>Three Theses </em>have tried 
  to get round this little difficulty by decreeing that since the workers' movement 
  is not led by Marxists, it is no workers' movement. But in that case there has 
  not been a labour movement in Europe since 1923.</p>


<p>To tell the workers of France that their trade unions and political parties 
  do not constitute a workers' movement would produce the deserved reply! Of course, 
  the IKD have only discovered this formulation recently. Before the re-emergence 
  of the labour movement in Western Europe, they described the British Labour 
  Party and trade-union movement as the only workers' movement left in Europe. 
  The British Labour Party can hardly be described as 'Marxist' or conscious of 
  the historic mission of the proletariat.</p>


<p>The re-emergence of the labour movement in all the countries of Europe reveals 
  that the whole 'retrogression' theory of the <em>Three Theses </em>was fundamentally 
  false. Under the totalitarian lid of fascism, the class struggle continued to 
  boil. If the socialist revolution was to be achieved it could only have been 
  led by the working class as a class, at the head of the mass of the people fighting 
  against foreign oppression and its national agencies at home, ie, the national 
  bourgeoisie and its appendages.</p>


<p>The proletariat could drag at the tail of the bourgeoisie through the 'all 
  people's movement' (as was consistently carried through by Stalinism in Western 
  Europe), or the mass of the petit bourgeoisie would be won to the programme 
  of the proletarian revolution on the basis of a revolutionary proletarian policy. 
  There was no middle way. Either with the bourgeoisie or with the proletariat. 
  That is the sole alternative in the present epoch.</p>


<p>We ask the IKD comrades: just reflect upon the development of Europe since 
  the fall of the nazis! What has emerged? Not an all-class people's movement, 
  but a division of political alignments in accordance with the basic class divisions 
  in society; a polarisation with the working-class parties on the one side and 
  the reaction on the other, with the petit-bourgeoisie uneasily balancing in 
  the 'centre' Christian Democratic parties, a position which they cannot maintain 
  indefinitely. Either they will go to the right in a neo-fascist reaction or 
  will be won to the proletarian revolution under the leadership of the proletariat.</p>


<h4>The Role of the EAM in Greece</h4>

<p>The comrades of the IKD in their <em>Two Balance Sheets </em>say:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Mistakes, if they are not investigated openly and corrected, must of 
  necessity be repeated and become graver with repetition. Witness the British 
  Section and the fighting in Greece. This broke out just after the RCP had drawn 
  up a resolution on the national question, point 5 of which declares 'all national 
  resistance movements to be agencies of one or the other group of imperialist 
  powers'.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;This goes for the EAM as well, therefore the RCP would have had to make 
  its stand against EAM with Churchill, if he was so blind as not to know his 
  own agency. This was not done; the <em>Socialist Appeal </em>came out in full 
  support for the EAM and could hardly have done otherwise. But what about the 
  resolution which had proved to clash with reality? Was it revised? No; it was 
  reality that had to undergo revision. The revolt in Greece was promoted to the 
  rank of the proletarian revolution. This valuable support, unfortunately, could 
  not prevent the defeat of the revolt; upon which - again without any investigation 
  - it was discovered that EAM after all was only a resistance movement, and Greece 
  is paraded as an example of what devastating results followed from supporting 
  a national movement.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;If it is 'supported' as here, by ignoring it until the point of uprising 
  is reached and then hailing it as the proletarian revolution, this is certainly 
  correct.&quot;</p>


<p class="fst">The position of the RCP is somewhat distorted by the IKD comrades in the above 
  quotation. To get a clear picture of the RCP's attitude towards the resistance 
  movement, permit us to quote the relevant sections of the resolution on the 
  national question in Europe:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;1. The Revolutionary Communist Party condemns and fights against the 
  national oppression of one nation by another; it supports the <em>right </em>of 
  complete self-determination and political secession of every nationally oppressed 
  people.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;2. In the epoch of imperialism and its present phase of imperialist war, 
  all the objective conditions demand that a genuine struggle for national freedom 
  must be linked to the programme of the socialist revolution and the struggle 
  for the United Socialist States of Europe.&quot;</p>


<p class="fst">While condemning the nazi oppression, the resolution condemns equally the national 
  oppression which is carried on by the Allies, and defines the attitude of the 
  revolutionaries to the resistance movements as follows:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;4. The role of the European ruling classes is clear to see. They collaborated 
  as <em>a class </em>with the foreign nazi oppressor and now seek to play the same 
  role as agents of the military victors - Anglo-American imperialism and the 
  Kremlin. Without the active support of Stalinism and social democracy the capitalists 
  would long have lost all semblance of support among the workers and peasants. 
  By subordinating the working class and its organisations to the leadership of 
  the bourgeoisie and to the programme of Anglo-American imperialism and Stalinism, 
  the social democratic and Stalinist parties play a counter-revolutionary role. 
  It is the duty of revolutionaries, while striving at all stages of the struggle 
  to win the rank and file to the banner of Trotskyism, to oppose and expose the 
  role of these parties and their auxiliary organisations.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;5. Despite their undoubted support from many thousands of the best proletarian 
  fighters who see in the resistance movements not an instrument for the replacement 
  of one master by another, but rather the instrument for the overthrow of capitalism 
  and the emancipation of the working class, these national resistance movements 
  in Europe today are agencies of one or other group of imperialist powers. As 
  movements they are incapable of genuinely struggling for national freedom.&quot;</p>


<p class="fst">That characterisation stands the test of events and requires no correction. 
  It is clearly applicable to EAM as well. During the imperialist war EAM was 
  on the side of Anglo-US imperialism against German imperialism. The RCP did 
  not take an ultra-left position on the question of national liberation. It stood 
  four-square for national liberation of the peoples of Europe from the shackles 
  of German imperialism. But we never failed to warn that the leadership of EAM 
  and other resistance movements were agents of imperialism.</p>


<p>Our warnings were confirmed by events. EAM did its best to come to a compromise 
  with imperialism and tried to disarm the working class in the face of the royalist-fascist 
  reaction and their imperialist backers. The fact that EAM came into collision 
  with Churchill and the imperialists was due to the fear of the latter that EAM 
  would not prove a reliable instrument in preventing the socialist revolution, 
  and that through EAM Greece might come under the domination of Stalin, thus 
  rounding off his hold on the Balkan peninsula.</p>


<p>The jibe about Churchill being 'so blind as not to know his own agency' befits 
  the level of the rest of the arguments. They might as well have asked: Why did 
  the Trotskyists support the Spanish republic against Franco, a republic which 
  they designated as an agency of Anglo-French imperialism and Stalinism? Or do 
  perchance the comrades now deny this and in retrospect discover that we had 
  a 'people's movement' in Spain as well?</p>


<p>This characterisation did not prevent the Trotskyists from describing the Spanish 
  events as an attempt at the proletarian revolution on the part of the masses, 
  in spite of the content given it by the bourgeoisie and Stalinists. The movement 
  in Spain was a proletarian revolution which was diverted into a 'people's bourgeois 
  democratic movement' against fascism, in alliance with the 'shadow of the bourgeoisie', 
  while the bourgeoisie itself was on the side of Franco.</p>


<p>So it was with EAM in Greece. The masses supported EAM. The bourgeoisie was 
  with Churchill while the 'shadow of the bourgeoisie' united with the Stalinist 
  leadership, and thus distorted the mass movement in a bourgeois direction. Despite 
  the Stalinist attempt at 'national unity', the class struggle broke through 
  the 'national people's movement'. This resulted in civil war between the proletarian-poor 
  peasant wing and the bourgeois wing within the resistance movement, even while 
  Greece was under the domination of the nazis.</p>


<p>After the so-called 'liberation', <em>de facto </em>power was in the hands of 
  the working class, just as in Spain after the insurrection of the workers in 
  Barcelona, Valencia and Madrid in the first days of the revolt. The EAM leadership 
  frustrated the movement of the masses, gave up their arms and tried to arrive 
  at an agreement with the imperialists. Despite their attempts at capitulation 
  to the imperialists, civil war broke out because of the movement of the masses. 
  If the IKD members deny that the revolt in Greece was an attempt at the seizure 
  of power on the part of the proletariat, how do they characterise this movement? 
  A 'people's movement'?</p>


<p>The revolt began as a spontaneous movement on the part of the masses, despite 
  all attempts of EAM to prevent its breaking out. The incident which set the 
  spark off was a classic one in the highly charged atmosphere to provoke a revolution. 
  The firing on an unarmed demonstration on the part of the royalist-fascist Security 
  Battalions was similar to the firing of the Czar's troops on the demonstration 
  led by Father Gapon at the Winter Palace in St Petersburg in 1905. Should Lenin, 
  instead of demanding the independence of the proletariat, have advocated the 
  merging of the labour movement in the all-class people's movement? To pose the 
  question is to answer it.</p>


<p>The firing in Constitution Square, Athens, as even the bourgeois <em>Times</em> 
  understood, sowed the seeds of civil war. Civil war between which classes, and 
  for what aims? For the 'people's revolution' or for the conquest of power by 
  the proletariat? EAM was a classic example of a popular front betrayal of the 
  proletarian revolution. Had EAM been successful, the regime that would have 
  issued from the struggle could only have been a bourgeois regime. All talk of 
  'democratic revolution', 'national revolution', 'all class people's movement', 
  etc, in the final analysis cannot but be a refurbished version of popular frontism.</p>


<p>There cannot be a 'democratic revolution' suspended in mid-air. The 'peoples' 
  revolution' must have a class basis. And so we arrive back where we started. 
  Define the class content of your revolution and then we will know where you 
  stand!</p>


<h4>What is the Aim of the 'Democratic Revolution'?</h4>

<p>In dealing with the elusive 'democratic revolution' which is neither proletarian 
  nor bourgeois, the IKD attempts to get out of the inextricable confusion by 
  defining the content as follows:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;[Grant is] fighting windmills. For instance the democratic revolution 
  which we [IKD] are alleged to substitute for the proletarian revolution whereas, 
  in reality, <em>we said that the democratic revolution </em>in our <em>epoch</em>, 
  '<em>can be realised only by the smashing of the framework of capitalism</em>'.&quot; (<em>Two Balance Sheets. </em>
Our emphasis)</p>


<p class="fst">Confusion thrice confounded! We are gratified to learn from these comrades 
  that the 'democratic people's revolution' which they state is necessary in our 
  epoch cannot be accomplished by bourgeois democracy. They claim they are now 
  '<em>alleged</em>' <em>to </em>substitute something for the proletarian revolution. 
  What then are they substituting for the proletarian revolution? Do they seriously 
  argue that all classes, including the oppressed bourgeoisie in the people's 
  movement, are going to 'smash the framework of capitalism'?</p>


<p>Is there any other revolution, apart from the proletarian revolution, that 
  can smash the framework of capitalism? When these comrades are pinned down to 
  Marxian definitions, one can see how they slide back and forth, and their <em>Theses 
  </em>become nothing short of nonsense. What then is the difference between the 
  democratic revolution and the proletarian revolution? The real answer is that 
  the comrades make it mean different things at different times, sometimes identifying 
  it with proletarian revolution, sometimes a new stage, and sometimes one knows 
  not what!</p>


<h4>The Tasks in Germany</h4>

<p>Just as they lumped the different classes in Europe under the rule of the nazis 
  indiscriminately together, so now in relation to Germany, they lump together 
  all classes oppressed by the Allies, to be united in an 'all-embracing national 
  democratic revolution'. Germany, of course, has to wage a struggle for national 
  freedom against her oppressors, just as the countries oppressed by Germany faced 
  the same problem. But the whole crux of the problem lies in <em>how </em>the struggle 
  for national liberation is to be waged.</p>


<p>The answer of the Fourth International is that national liberation can be accomplished 
  only by the proletariat at the head of the movement. That will be the central 
  idea put forward by German Marxists. Far from blurring over the class lines, 
  these will be emphasised. Only a clear fighting class policy will win the petit 
  bourgeoisie over to the programme of the socialist revolution, which is indissolubly 
  bound up with the struggle against the Allied oppressors. Such a struggle can 
  only be waged as a class struggle.</p>


<p>Yet the IKD comrades, again using intentionally vague formulations, leave the 
  door wide open to the most shameless opportunism, and even capitulation to reaction. 
  They say:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Unless the Fourth International makes the support of all movements for 
  national liberation according to the <em>Three Theses </em>the main point in its 
  programme for Germany, it will not be able to offer the masses anything beyond 
  the programme of the reformists - nor even beyond the performance of the occupation 
  authorities; for these have expropriated German capitalists (without compensation!) 
  and clapped them into jail into the bargain - witness the action of the British 
  military government against the coal owners of the Ruhr...&quot; <em>(Two 
  Balance Sheets).</em></p>


<p class="fst">The German workers, we can be sure, will weep no tears over the fate of the 
  coal barons in the Ruhr, nor of the bourgeoisie as a whole in the territory 
  occupied by the Russians. But the demand of the German Trotskyists in both sections 
  of Germany will be for <em>the withdrawal of the occupation troops, and for the 
  running and controlling of German industry by the working class. 
  </em>To imagine that the problem of the German economy can be separated from 
  the question: which <em>class </em>will control? is to turn one's back on Marxism. 
  We can only penetrate the ranks of the social democrats and Stalinists by giving 
  them a <em>class </em>alternative to the capitulation of their leaders to the 
  Allies.</p>


<p>The struggle for freedom from national oppression in Germany can be waged on 
  the lines of Schlageter<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup>, the reactionary forerunner of the nazis, or it can be waged 
  by the method of Lenin and Trotsky, on class lines. The petit bourgeoisie goes 
  either with the bourgeois reaction or with the proletariat. In Russia the Bolsheviks 
  waged a ruthless struggle against those who sought to surrender the class independence 
  of the proletariat in the 'people's movement' against Czarism. In the East they 
  denounced as the grossest treachery, the subordination of the communist movement 
  to the bourgeois 'people's movement' for national liberation.</p>


<p>Only the proletariat, fighting on an independent class programme, could win 
  the petit bourgeois masses to the struggle for national liberation, which could 
  only be a struggle for power, ie, dictatorship of the proletariat. Transitional 
  demands would be advanced - constituent assembly, expulsion of the occupation 
  troops, but these would not he separated from the struggle for power. Events 
  one after another, are revealing the petit bourgeois mode of thought, even the 
  reactionary content of the ideas of the IKD comrades. </p>


<p>The day before yesterday, as impressionists, they were driven off the class 
  compass by the spectacle of the national oppression of Europe by the nazis. 
  Then they floundered on the Allied conquest of Europe. Today, they have attempted 
  to find their last hideout in Germany. But Germany again reveals pitilessly 
  that the class structure of society results in a <em>political </em>division between 
  the classes, and not at all their unification, even under the heel of a foreign 
  conqueror, and even in a highly industrialised country like Germany whose industry 
  has been partially destroyed.</p>


<p>In their practical activity in Germany, the protagonists of the IKD position 
  looked towards university students and various strata of 'nationalist youth', 
  without reference to class, to lead the 'national revolution' which supposedly 
  united all classes in Germany! Naturally, with their conceptions of a destroyed 
  working class and the incapacity of the proletariat, because of this, to give 
  leadership to the nation, they turn their backs on the genuine forces of German 
  national renaissance. They rejected the idea of the Fourth International concentrating 
  on the working class organised anew under the banner of social democracy and 
  Stalinism.</p>


<p>These, according to these sceptics, represented only the 'old' people with 
  memories in the past. The 'nationalist youth' were the forces which would lead 
  the struggle for the 'all embracing national-democratic revolution'. Now that 
  the elections have been held in Germany, what has been revealed anew? The stubborn 
  division of Germany on <em>class lines. </em>The middle class, as in the countries 
  of Western Europe, have grouped round the reactionary banner of Christian Democracy, 
  and thus become a counterweight of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat.</p>


<p>But the workers, despite all, despite the pessimists of the IKD, have clung 
  tenaciously to their class traditions and voted for the workers' parties. The 
  wonderful powers of recuperation of the working class, their aspirations to 
  achieve the socialist revolution, their class instinct, is shown by the fact 
  that despite the terrible betrayals, the workers' organisations received a greater 
  percentage of the votes than before the coming to power of the nazis. There 
  was no alternative revolutionary Marxist party, but the elections prove precisely 
  the possibilities for a genuine Marxist current based on the class internationalist 
  programme.</p>


<p>The struggle for national liberation does not and cannot prevent the inevitable 
  differentiation of the population on class lines. And it could not be otherwise. 
  National oppression does not abolish class exploitation, but merely aggravates 
  it. A revolutionary criticism of the policy of Stalinism and social democracy, 
  a class struggle waged on the traditional lines of Marxism-Leninism, offers 
  the greatest possibilities for the Fourth International in Germany today. Even 
  the Social Democrats go farther than the IKD.</p>


<p>In order to gain the support of the German proletariat, the Social Democratic 
  leaders are making centrist pseudo-left speeches. They have as a consequence 
  the support of the bulk of the youth, more particularly the working-class youth 
  which is instinctively groping towards the socialist revolution as the only 
  way out. The task of the German Trotskyists will be to demand that the Social 
  Democratic leaders match their words with deeds. There are, of course, parties 
  to the right of the Christian Democrats, playing with the ideology of nationalism. 
  In every case they are either neo-fascist or represent some variety of extreme 
  reaction.</p>


<p>It was not for nothing that Trotsky castigated the Stalinists for their flirtation 
  with nationalist demagogy and slogans in competition with the demagogic denunciations 
  by the nazis of the Versailles Treaty. Such a method cannot advance the struggle 
  one single inch forward. It can only play into the hands of reaction. The struggle 
  for national liberation must have a class axis, and cannot be separated from 
  the socialist revolution. The petit bourgeoisie cannot be won to the socialist 
  revolution by the adoption of a petit bourgeois 'national democratic' programme 
  on the part of the proletariat. That would merely mean that the proletariat 
  would drag at the tail of the petit bourgeoisie, and thus of the big bourgeoisie.</p>


<p>The petit bourgeoisie can only be won to the struggle against national oppression 
  under the banner of the struggle against capitalism. Otherwise, they will once 
  again become a tool of reaction, in a more frightful form. Germany will not 
  go through the so-called 'necessary detour' of the national democratic revolution 
  in any shape or form. We base ourselves on the traditions of 1918, not on the 
  traditions of 1813. There can be no democratic revolution in Germany other than 
  that achieved by the Allies!</p>


<p>In fact, the restoration of industry in Germany, even partially, which the 
  Allies have been compelled to undertake will restore also the self-confidence 
  of the German proletariat, whose temper has already been shown by the series 
  of marvellous protest strikes directed against the 'nationalists' (who have 
  thrown bombs against the American military government) and the protest strikes 
  against the release of Papen, Schacht and other nazis. The demonstrations were 
  undertaken to show that never again will the German proletariat allow German 
  reaction to take power without a fierce struggle.</p>


<p>Whether speedy or protracted, whether conducted for economic and democratic 
  transitional demands. for a united Germany and for a constituent assembly embracing 
  all Germany free of Allied occupation, whatever demands will be put forward 
  these can only be part of the struggle for the proletarian revolution during 
  which soviets and workers' committees can be set up.</p>


<p>Other than this, there can only be the bourgeois counter-revolution in a democratic 
  or fascist form, democratic counter-revolution which will be supported by the 
  Stalinists and Social Democrats under conditions of mass upsurge, just as the 
  Social Democrats supported it in 1918. If the position of the IKD were to be 
  accepted by the German proletarian vanguard, it would result in a frightful 
  trap for the German proletariat and new misfortunes and defeats of the working 
  class.</p>
