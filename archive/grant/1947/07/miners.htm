<h1>Stop Threatening the Miners&mdash;Capitalist Coal Board must be replaced by Workers&#8217; Control</h1>

<p class="fst">
Lord Hyndley,
on behalf of the Coal Board, has written a letter to the National Union of
Miners as part of a prepared campaign of threats and intimidation against the
miners. In this letter he threatens &#8220;unofficial&#8221; strikers with prosecution.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Daily
Telegraph</em> of July 17<sup>th</sup>, remarks with satisfaction: &#8220;The policy
of prosecuting unofficial strikers would be a reversion to the practice of the
colliery companies before the industry was nationalised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And indeed,
there can be no surprise at this. Largely, the same old managers, and even in
many cases, the same old coalowners, continue to run the pits. This is
exemplified by the situation in South Wales where the administration has been
criticised by the South Wales Executive of the Miners&#8217; Union as a result of the
dissatisfaction of the miners. The officials on the Regional Coal Board are
General Sir Reade Godwin-Austen, Mr. G. E. Aeron-Thomas, former coal-owner, and
Mr. Iestyn Williams, formerly Secretary of the Monmouthshire and South Wales
Coalowners&#8217; Association.
</p>
<p>
The arrogant
ruling class attitude of these people is shown in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>
report of an interview in its July 7<sup>th</sup> issue with a &#8220;high official
of the North Eastern Division of the Coal Board,&#8221; when he said: &#8220;he is
seriously considering the prosecution and dismissal of the ringleaders
concerned [in unofficial strikes&#8212;EG]&#8230;The ringleaders and all the undesireables
in the industry must be weeded out and got rid of &#8209; sacked.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;The official
described the position as &#8216;desperate&#8217;, and added &#8216;The time has arrived when
miners must properly appreciate their obligations&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
The whole of
the capitalist press as one pack is in full cry against &#8220;unofficial&#8221; strikes,
especially among the miners. The <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, organ of the former
coalowners, remarked with satisfaction in its editorial of July 7<sup>th</sup>
in commenting on this threat made by the North Eastern Coal Board:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Such a
statement from the mouth of a private employer would be denounced in unmeasured
terms as a threat of &#8216;victimisation&#8217;, sufficient in itself to cause a strike.
It does not become less formidable in its implications from the lips of an
executive of a great nationalised monopoly.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Instead of
denouncing these monstrous threats and explaining the reasons for &#8220;unofficial&#8221;
strikes, Will Lawther, the President of the N.U.M. gave an interview with the
reactionary <em>Daily Mail</em> in which he gave the green light to the Coal
Board to go ahead: &#8220;Disciplinary action would not lead to trouble in the coal
fields. There would be no sympathy with the offenders [unofficial
strikers&#8212;EG].&#8221;
</p>
<p>
He repeated
his warning against unofficial strikes in his Presidential address to the
Miners&#8217; Union Conference in Scotland. He did not have a word to say about the
insolent challenge to the rights of the workers by the spokesmen of the Coal
Board.
</p>
<p>
The Ministers
in the Government, including Shinwell, Minister of Mines, are also making
veiled threats. In dealing with absenteeism, Shinwell said: &#8220;work or get out&#8221;
at a speech in Cannock.
</p>
<p>
None of these
Labour leaders ever raise the real problem: Shinwell uses the term &#8220;parasite&#8221;
but never in connection with those capitalist parasites who have been so
lavishly compensated as a reward for ruining the industry.
</p>
<p>
Every worker
knows that miners, no more than other workers, [do not] indulge in strikes for
fun. Only when they have a genuine grievance and their patience has come to an
end and there is no other means of redress, do workers organise strikes &#8209;
official or &#8220;unofficial&#8221;. The responsibility for these strikes is on the
shoulders of the management of the Coal Board &#8209; and on the Union leaders for
not paying sufficient attention to the grievances of the workers.
</p>
<p>
What is the
real cause of the trouble? The <em>Daily Mail</em> in its editorial of July 7<sup>th</sup>
remarks with malicious glee:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;So far the
magic of Nationalisation has not worked. Before the war this policy always
meant &#8216;the mines for the miners&#8217;, but as it has turned out the men have no direct
voice in the industry at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
They use this
to discredit the idea of nationalisation among the workers. But it is true that
the Labour leaders are operating not a socialist policy based upon workers&#8217;
control and management, but one of State capitalism.
</p>
<p>
If the Labour
leaders continue on this course it will not solve the coal question. It will
mean bigger and more bitter strikes in the coalfields. It will assist the
capitalists to discredit the Labour Government.
</p>
<p>
The only
progressive way out lies, not in restricting the right to strike, but in
eliminating the root cause of the trouble &#8209; capitalist control of the mines.
</p>
<p>
The miners
must counter this propaganda barrage by the simple demand: Away with the
capitalist Coal Board! The miners must themselves manage and control the pits
through elected committees.
