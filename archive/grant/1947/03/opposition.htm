<p class="fst">
The
outstanding feature of the Communist Party conference this year was the
revolutionary opposition among sections of the rank and file which succeeded in
penetrating to the floor of the conference.
</p>
<p>
This was a
reflection of the restlessness of the worker element in the rank and file at
the policy of the Party since the end of the war.
</p>
<p>
To the more
advanced and sincere members of the Communist Party it is beginning to be plain
that the policy of the &#8220;Communist&#8221; Party is not really Communist, that it is
merely a more &#8220;Left&#8221; version of the policy of reformism which was attacked by
Lenin.
</p>
<p>
This mood is
demonstrated by the discussion which the leadership has been forced to allow
within the pages of <em>World News and Views</em>. From branches all over the
country have come letters of criticism and suggestions in the direction of a
sound working class policy.
</p>
<p>
From
Manchester, one of the members of the Rails Group, Comrade Bill Ward, writes of
the nationalisation of the railways which he correctly supports:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;It seems apparent that what is needed is a national
policy of depot committees that could be related to regional committees
[i.e.&#8212;what this comrade is really advocating is workers&#8217; control which the
leadership of the Communist Party is studiously avoiding&#8212;EG]. Class conscious
workers have dreamed of this change-over, the dream must not become a
nightmare.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
This reflects
the instinctive opposition of the best Communist Party workers to the policy of
State capitalism of the Labour Government which can only lead the workers to
catastrophe. But neither in the Conference or anywhere else have the C.P.
leaders explained this problem to the working class or even their own members.
They have covered up the reactionary aspects of the policy of the Labour
Government on nationalisation and evaded the Leninist solution.
</p>
<p>
This
revolutionary opposition tendency was most firmly and consistently expressed by
the amendment from Hertford and Welwyn Garden City which criticised the policy
of the Party.
</p>
<h4>Marxist criticism from Hertford</h4>
<p class="fst">
In an
excellent letter published in <em>World News and Views</em>, Eric Heffer writes
the following unassailable Marxist criticism of the Congress resolution of the
Communist Party:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;The E.C. Resolution, Section 1, &#8216;The deepened
crisis of capitalism&#8217;, begins from a correct premise, but leaves out a vitally
important feature of the present situation, and as a result it gives a wrong
conclusion. It shows the weakened position of British imperialism, but does not
show the strengthened position of monopoly within Britain, and their fusion
with the state apparatus which resulted from World War II, and which is the
basis of the present predatory foreign policy. Imperialism is not a policy
preferred by this or that group of capitalist politicians, but is a definite
stage of capitalism.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;The E.C. Resolution glosses over vital
theoretical problems. The policy presented as a result of this failure can only
be described as Left Social-Democratic, i.e. opportunist. Lenin says, &#8216;A
Marxist is one who extends the acceptance of the class struggle to the
acceptance of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Herein lies the deepest
difference between a Marxist and an ordinary petty or big bourgeois. On this
touchstone it is necessary to test a real understanding and acceptance of
Marxism.&#8217; (<em>State and Revolution</em>).
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;It would appear that today our E.C. does not
accept this statement, because in place of a clear formulation of the basic
tasks of the proletariat and the Party we are given the vague term, &#8216;the
Socialist way&#8217;.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;By the E.C. forgetting the dictatorship of the
proletariat, and informing that now a peaceful transition to Socialism is
possible, it means that they have virtually abandoned Marxism, or only make use
of those parts and quotations, etc., which are acceptable to the-petty
bourgeoisie.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Lenin says: &#8216;Only a proletarian, Socialist
revolution is able to lead humanity out of the blind alley created by
imperialism and imperialist wars!&#8217; &#8209; (<em>Revision of the Party Programme</em>).
This has little in common with the theory of peaceful transition.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
The <em>Daily
Worker</em>, in reporting the amendment only gives part of it, &#8220;He [Comrade Eric
Heffer &#8209; EG] accused the executive committee of taking a reformist opportunist
path &#8216;the perspective of the proletarian revolution has been abandoned,&#8217; he
declared: &#8216;Our executive committee is committing us to the support of a
Government of social traitors who are leading this country to economic disaster
and the victory of reaction. We must endeavour to use the economic crisis for
the overthrow of the capitalist system&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Among the
&#8220;crimes&#8221; of the comrades which were recorded against them by one of the C.P.
leaders was that, &#8220;The length to which they are prepared to go was shown by the
fact that during discussion at the Welwyn Garden City Branch about nominations
to the Executive Committee, they voted down Comrades Pollitt, Gallacher, Putt,
Kerrigan, Horner and others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Using the
typical slander method which is used against all revolutionary opposition in
the Communist Party, Betty Matthews, the South-East Midlands District
Organiser, then tried to make an amalgam and link the opposition with
Churchill:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a single word in the amendment about the
menace of the Tories. We are invited to join hands with Churchill and the big
industrialists to weaken the Labour Government,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This policy
completely ignores the power of the working class to direct the affairs of the
nation.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Coming from
people who had advocated support for Churchill during the war, and at the time
of the General Election advocated a coalition government with the Tories, this
constituted cynical contempt of the thinking members of the C.P. The reference
to the power of the working class was sheer demagogy to cover up the
capitulation to reformism.
</p>
<p>
The amendment
from Hertford showed a genuine attempt to return to the policy of Lenin. True,
in the reaction to the opportunist policy of the C.P. leadership it was
slightly ultra-left, a position which the leadership attempted to use in order
to cover their retreat from the revolutionary position. But in its main essence
it was a Leninist position in relation to strategy, while it was faulty in
relation to tactics. Whereas the position put forward by the C.P. leadership
had nothing in common with the method and aims of Lenin whatsoever. In
conducting the struggle against Kornilov (the Russian Franco) in &#8220;support&#8221; of
Kerensky (the Russian Attlee), Lenin wrote:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;And <em>even now</em> we must not support Kerensky&#8217;s
government. That would be unprincipled. It will be asked: What, not even fight
Kornilov? Of course, fight him! But that is not the same thing; there is a
dividing line; that line is being overstepped by certain Bolsheviks, who allow
themselves to become &#8216;compromisers&#8217; and to be <em>carried away</em> by the flood
of events.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;We will fight and are fighting Kornilov, <em>just
as Kerensky&#8217;s troops are</em>. But we do not support Kerensky; <em>on the
contrary</em>, we expose his weakness. That is the difference. It is a rather
subtle difference, but an extremely important one, and must not be forgotten.&#8221;
(<em>Selected Works</em>, Vol. 6, p. 205, emphasis in original).
</p>
<p class="fst">
Contrast this
with the attitude of the Communist Party leaders. Against the Tories the
Trotskyists have always supported the Labour leaders. Carrying out Lenin&#8217;s
advice, we advocated &#8220;Labour to Power&#8221; at the General Election. But we never
identified ourselves with the reactionary policy of the Labour leaders, we
never lied to the workers and deceived them that the measures advocated by the
Labour leaders could serve the needs and interests of the workers. Thus by
going through the experience of the workers together with them, we hoped by
patient explanation to win them to the programme of the Socialist revolution.
</p>
<p>
This is the
policy which the Hertford and Welwyn Garden City amendment is striving to
express, and to which many of the worker-members of the Communist Party are
groping. It has nothing in common with the shameful policy of the Communist
Party leadership which is a travesty of Communism.
</p>
<p>
Having failed
by all the usual methods of pressure to shake the members of these branches,
Pollitt indicated that they would suffer the usual fate of any determined
opposition within the C.P.: &#8220;Referring to the Welwyn Garden City and Hertford
amendment, he [Pollitt&#8212;EG] said the new executive committee would have as one
of its first duties the task of ensuring that these branches were reorganised.&#8221;
(<em>Daily Worker</em>, February 12<sup>th</sup>).
</p>
<p>
What Pollitt
means, of course, is, that every step will be taken to silence all those who
remain true to their convictions and attempt to stand by a Leninist position.
</p>
<p>
If these
workers wish to fight for a genuine Marxist-Leninist policy, they will find
this possible only within the ranks of the Fourth International.
