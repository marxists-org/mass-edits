Henry
Wallace, the American &#8220;Liberal&#8221;, has been addressing a large number of meetings
in Britain
attacking the present policy of Truman.
</p>
<p>
At the same
time as Wallace condemns the American moves to establish world domination,
especially directed against Russia,
by propping up reaction in Greece
and Turkey and elsewhere, he
claims that Roosevelt&#8217;s policy was entirely
&#8220;different&#8221; and even &#8220;progressive.&#8221; But under the Roosevelt
administration, the same policy of furthering the world domination of American
imperialism was pursued.
</p>
<p>
In his speech
at Manchester, under the auspices of the Lancashire and Cheshire Federation of Trades Councils,
Wallace demagogically stated:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;&#8230;In the
manpower and equipment of America
and Britain
we have the resources to do the job of peaceful world reconstruction&#8230; Never in
our history has farm and factory production approached our present record
heights. Fifty-eight million American workers, devoted to useful production,
can launch a great offensive against our real enemies, poverty, homelessness,
disease, and hunger. American fertiliser plant and farm machinery can transform
the lives and standards of hundreds of millions within a generation. American
machine tools and equipment for power plants, docks, and railroads can start
poverty-stricken peoples on the road to modern life.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Wallace is no
socialist. He is no representative of the working class. All this would be true
if Wallace did not cynically ignore the fatal flaw in such schemes: <em>capitalists
are not interested in production to benefit the peoples of the world or even
their own people. They are interested only in profits</em>.
</p>
<p>
If the
productive forces in the world were to be utilised for the purposes of
construction, the entire planet could be transformed and the standards of
living and level of culture raised to undreamed of heights. This is not
possible under capitalism. Plenty under this system can only produce crises of
over-production, slumps and unemployment, because of the basic necessity of the
capitalist class to make profits. Despite the hunger and famine in dozens of
countries, potatoes in millions of bushels have been destroyed in America because
there was a &#8220;surplus&#8221;. It was not profitable to feed the starving peoples &#8209;
therefore the American capitalist class preferred to plough and crush the
potatoes into the ground. So it is under Truman. So it was under Roosevelt.
</p>
<p>
The American
capitalists openly forecast a new &#8220;economic recession&#8221; in the immediate future.
This springs from the economic laws of the system, not the desires, good or
bad, on the part of the capitalists.
</p>
<p>
<em>In reality,
these sugary phrases of Wallace serve the same purpose as did Roosevelt&#8217;s
New Deal propaganda</em>.
</p>
<p>
Wallace
openly revealed his calculations when be said that he expected he would gain
support for his policy when the inevitable depression affected America. The
American workers are in no mood to tolerate a new slump without mass protest.
Without a &#8220;radical&#8221; alternative, they would break away from the old capitalist
parties and move towards Socialism and Communism as a way out.
</p>
<p>
Consequently
Wallace&#8217;s liberal phrases act as a convenient means of preventing the break
away of the workers in America, especially the organised workers, from
capitalist policies and the traditional Republican and Democratic capitalist
parties.
</p>
<p>
When Wallace
was questioned at his Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent
meeting, he said that in all probability he would not form a third party, in
American politics. Thus even a Liberal, capitalist set-up, would only be
undertaken by Wallace, in order <em>to prevent the formation of a genuine Labour
Party, based as the British Labour Party has been on the trade unions, and
organised on a class basis</em>.
</p>
<p>
That this is
so, is shown by the fact that Wallace still remains in the Democratic Party,
which is united with the Republicans to support Truman in his imperialist
course: the course of American Big Business. <em>Between him and Truman there
are no fundamental divergences on principle</em>. It is purely a question of the
division of Labour. Both serve the same interests. <em>But Wallace represents a
reserve weapon of American imperialism</em>. Truman indicated this recently when
he pointed out that Wallace intended to support the candidates of the
Democratic Party at the next election.
</p>
<p>
The policies
of Wallace, no more than the policy of Trumanism can [not] solve the problems
of the American or world working class. Only the unity of the workers, leading
to a Socialist Europe and a Socialist World can produce that &#8220;One World&#8221; which
can abolish want and oppression, fascism and war.
